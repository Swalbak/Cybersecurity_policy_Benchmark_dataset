CYBER READINESS INDEX 2.0  A PLAN FOR CYBER READINESS: A BASELINE AND AN INDEX  Principal Investigator: Melissa Hathaway Chris Demchak, Jason Kerben, Jennifer McArdle, Francesca Spidalieri  The Cyber Readiness Index 2.0 is expanded from the Cyber Readiness Index 1.0, published November 2013.  INTRODUCTION  Global leaders understand that increased Inter- net connectivity leads to economic growth only  if the underlying infrastructure and the devices  connected to it are safe and secure. Therefore,  countries must align their national economic  visions with their national security priorities.  Until now, however, there has not been a com- prehensive, comparative, experiential meth- odology to evaluate a country’s maturity and  commitment to securing its national cyber in- frastructure and services upon which its digital  future and growth depend. The Cyber Readi- ness Index (CRI) 1.01 represented a new way  of examining the problem and was designed  to spark international discussion and inspire  global action to address the economic erosion  caused by cyber insecurity.  Today, no country is cyber ready.  It is a given that global economic growth is  increasingly dependent upon the rapid adop- tion of information communication technology  (ICT) and connecting society to the Internet.  Indeed, each country’s digital agenda promis- es to stimulate economic growth, increase ef- ficiency, improve service delivery and capacity,  drive innovation and productivity gains, and  promote good governance. Yet, the availabil- ity, integrity, and resilience of this core infra- structure are in harm’s way. The volume, scope,  velocity, and sophistication of threats to our  networked systems and infrastructures are real  and growing. Data breaches, criminal activity,  service disruptions, and property destruction  are becoming commonplace and threaten the  Internet economy.  ©  2015 Cyber Readiness Index 2.0, all rights reserved.  2  Building on CRI 1.0, Cyber Readiness Index 2.0  examines one hundred twenty-five countries  that have embraced, or are starting to em- brace, ICT and the Internet and then applies  an objective methodology to evaluate each  country’s maturity and commitment to cyber  security across seven essential elements. By  applying this methodology, a country can bet- ter understand its Internet-Infrastructure entan- glements and the resulting dependencies and  vulnerabilities.2 Specifically, the CRI 2.0 assess- es countries’ levels of preparedness for certain  cyber risks and  identifies areas where national  leaders can alter or refine their country’s current  posture by leveraging or changing laws, poli- cies, standards, market levers (e.g., incentives  and regulations), and implementing other ini- tiatives to preserve the security of their connec- tivity and protect the value of their economy.  BACKGROUND Most countries have embraced ICT-enabled  economic strategies  and are working to pro- vide fast, reliable, and affordable communica- tions to every household and business to move  their information society into the digital age.3  Modernization initiatives like e-government,  e-banking, e-health, e-learning, next gener- ation power grids, and automating elements  of the transportation infrastructure and other  essential services, are at the top of most coun- tries’ economic agenda. For example, China’s  Internet Plus strategy seeks to actively encour- age the healthy development of e-commerce,  industrial networks, and Internet banking, as  well as facilitate the growth of new industries  and the expansion of its companies’ inter- national Internet footprint.4 Like many other  countries, China views the Internet as key to  its future growth and development opportuni-  ties. Similarly, India’s Prime Minister Modi laid  out his vision to transform his country into a  “digitally empowered knowledge economy;”  leveraging India’s globally acclaimed informa- tion technology (IT) competence to create jobs  in IT, telecommunications, and in electronic  device markets. In addition, India is seeking  to become an innovator in ICT solutions for  health, knowledge management, and financial  markets.5 Finally, the European Commission is  working to create a meaningful single market  for digital services that can enable the free  movement of goods, services, capital, and  businesses. Successful implementation of this  “Digital Single Market Strategy” is estimated  to lead to an additional €415 billion per year in  GDP growth across Europe.6  Countries must align their  national economic visions with  their national security priorities.  Governments, in developing countries in par- ticular, are pushing for even more aggressive  ICT adoption strategies to provide additional  services to millions of citizens in order to more  rapidly boost and deepen economic advanc- es.7 In fact, the World Bank estimates that for  every 10 percent of the population connected  to the Internet, GDP grows by 1 to 2 percent.8  Moreover, recent research suggests a growing  recognition among governments and busi- nesses that embracing the Internet and ICTs  will enhance their long-term competitiveness  3  ©  2015 Cyber Readiness Index 2.0, all rights reserved.  and societal well-being, potentially contribut- ing up to 8 percent of a nation’s GDP.9  Some  reports go even further to suggest that the  modernization of industrial systems (e.g., elec- tric power grids, oil and gas pipelines, manu- facturing, etc.) represents a 46 percent share of  the global economy, and could rise to as much  as 50 percent in the next ten years.10  Nations cannot afford to ignore this economic  opportunity. But few are considering the  impact and economic costs of less resilient  critical services, exposure/violation of citizen  privacy, theft of corporate proprietary data and  state secrets, and the impact of e-fraud and  e-crime—all of which lead to economic and  national security instability. Put simply, cyber  insecurity is a tax on growth.11  For example, it is estimated that the Group of  Twenty (G20) economies have lost 2.5 million  jobs to counterfeiting and piracy, and that  governments and consumers lose up to $125  billion to cyber crime annually, including losses  in tax revenue.12 The United States estimates  the annual impact of international intellectual  property (IP) theft to the American economy  at $300 billion. This corresponds to 1 percent  of its GDP.13 Other studies conducted by the  Netherlands, United Kingdom, and Germany  estimate similar losses in GDP. No nation can  afford to lose even 1 percent of its GDP to illicit  cyber activities. As countries continue to em- brace ICT and Internet connectivity, however,  the exposure, attendant risks, and economic  costs will exponentially increase if security and  resilience are not at the core of their modern- ization strategies.  Measuring such losses to the economy will  force national leaders to better align their  country’s national security agenda with their  economic agenda and invest in the derivative  value of both.14 Bringing transparency to the  economic losses caused by cyber insecurity  may spark national and global interest in ad- dressing this economic erosion.  The CRI 2.0  establishes a framework to guide countries in  securely pursuing the economic growth of a re- silient, ICT-enhanced, and connected society.  CYBER READINESS INDEX  2.0 — THE METHODOLOGY The CRI 2.0 has two main components: first, it is  designed to inform national leaders on the steps  they should consider to protect their increas- ingly connected countries and potential GDP  growth by objectively evaluating each country’s  maturity and commitment to cyber security and  resilience. Secondly, the CRI defines what it  means for a country to be “cyber ready” and  documents the core components of cyber read- iness into an actionable blueprint for countries  to follow. The CRI 2.0 methodology represents  a useful, unique, and user-friendly tool to as- sess the gap between a nation’s current cyber  security posture and the national cyber capa-  Resilient connected societies  must drive modernization  with security at its core.  Cyber insecurity is a  tax on growth.  ©  2015 Cyber Readiness Index 2.0, all rights reserved.  4  bilities needed to achieve its economic vision.  The blueprint developed and employed for this  analysis includes over seventy unique data indi- cators across the following seven elements:  1. National strategy;  2. Incident response;  3. E-crime and law enforcement;  4. Information sharing;  5. Investment in research and  development (R&D);  6. Diplomacy and trade; and  7. Defense and crisis response.  The fact-based assessments for each coun- try rely on primary sources, and each unique  data point is grounded on empirical research  and documentation. Countries are assessed  for each indicator across three levels of cyber  readiness: insufficient evidence, partially oper- ational or fully operational.  The CRI 2.0 methodology is being applied to  evaluate one hundred twenty-five countries’  cyber readiness; assessing each country’s ma- turity and commitment to cyber security and  resilient infrastructures and services (Figure 1  and Table 1).  The country selection includes the top  seventy-five countries from the International  Telecommunication Union (ITU) ICT Develop- ment Index (IDI) to emphasize the importance  of connectedness. Members of the G20 econ- omies were added because they represent 90  percent of global GDP, 80 percent of interna- tional trade, 64 percent of the world’s popula- tion, and 84 percent of all fossil fuel emissions.  In order to be regionally representative and  globally inclusive, additional countries were  selected from: the Organization for Economic  Cooperation and Development (OECD), the  African Economic Community (AEC), the Latin  American Integration Association (LAIA), the  Insufficient Evidence: evidence is lacking or has yet to be  located. It is possible, however, that the data exists but is not  yet publicly available or is classified.  Partially Operational: there is evidence of policies, activi- ties, and/or funding, however, the activity may be immature,  incomplete, or still in the early stages of development. While  these initiatives can be observed, it may be difficult to mea- sure their functionality.  Fully Operational: there is sufficient evidence to observe and  measure a mature, functioning activity.15  5  ©  2015 Cyber Readiness Index 2.0, all rights reserved.

Countries from  these regional economic groupings are repre- sented in the IDI, and are often also included in  the World Economic Forum’s (WEF)  Network  Readiness Index. This ensures that every se- lected country is embracing ICT and investing  in accessible and affordable Internet services  to promote economic growth.  Given that the GCC is not representative of the  Middle East, three states that have the highest  GDP rankings outside the GCC were also add- ed: Iran, Yemen, and Lebanon.16  This cross-section of one hundred twenty-five  countries represents a significant portion of the  world and is demonstrative of the diverse and  representative nature of the CRI 2.0’s country  selection criteria.  The CRI 2.0’s focus on the interconnection be- tween economics and security (or lack thereof) provides a solid foundation for each country to  assess its cyber security maturity, and serves  as a framework for informing policy and strat- egy, operational and institutional initiatives,  resourcing requirements, regulatory and leg- islative formulation, and diverse market lever  implementation. Implementing CRI 2.0 will  raise awareness about the linkage between a  sustainable cyberspace and GDP growth for  every country, given that the future of a coun- try’s GDP is likely to be increasingly technology  dominated and Internet-related. Moreover, it  creates the basis for understanding the eco-  nomic erosion caused by cyber insecurity and  the degree to which national security concerns  are considered a component of a country’s dig- ital and economic agenda. This methodology  can lead to analytically based decisions on how  to respond to and get ahead of the problem.  Finally, the CRI 2.0 provides international enti- ties, such as the ITU, the WEF, the Organization  of American States (OAS), the Inter-American  Development Bank (IDB), the World Bank, and  others, with a framework and complimentary  approach to their respective initiatives and in- ternational discussions.  A detailed description of the seven essential  elements of the CRI 2.0 methodology follows.  Each section contains an essential element with  at least ten supporting indicators for evalua- tion that when combined represent a blueprint  of a country’s cyber readiness. Furthermore,  country examples are provided that illustrate  innovative and multicultural solutions towards  becoming cyber ready. While these examples  are by no means comprehensive, they do high- light unique country-level approaches.  1. NATIONAL STRATEGY  The first—and most important—area that indi- cates a country’s cyber readiness is the articula- tion and publication of a National Cyber Secu- rity Strategy that aligns the country’s economic  vision with its national security imperatives.  The Internet, broadband networks, mobile ap- plications, IT services, software, and hardware  constitute the foundations of the digital econo- my and a country’s digital future.17 The Internet  and ICTs have become the backbone of family  platforms (e.g., Facebook™, Twitter™, Insta-  7  ©  2015 Cyber Readiness Index 2.0, all rights reserved.  gram™, Renren™, VKontakte™, etc.), business  engines, critical services and infrastructures,  and the global economy.18 The inter-depen- dencies and hyper-connectivity touch each  sector. For example, advanced manufacturing  uses industrial control systems and robotics to  increase productivity and decrease the need  for manual intervention. Modern agriculture  embeds Internet Protocol (IP) devices on  crops to determine fertilizer requirements and  to adjust water supplies.  IP devices are also  placed on livestock to determine where the  animals graze and consume water, assessing  the animals’ health on a near-constant basis.  E-commerce, the free flow of goods and ser- vices across borders, is displacing the role of  traditional storefronts, delivering a wide vari- ety of items directly to the doorstep of on-line  shoppers shortly after they place an on-line  order. Transportation systems now use sensors,  mobile devices, and unmanned kiosks to man- age traffic and deliver tickets. Connected cities  use geo-location devices to track the speed  and location of automobiles to determine if a  driver has obeyed the laws of the road. Mod- ernization initiatives in the healthcare indus- try are digitizing citizens’ health records and  employing cloud-based computing to enable  swift access to healthcare records anywhere  in the world. Telemedicine uses high-speed  Internet to deliver medical advice and services  to underserved areas. Finally, financial systems  exchange trillions of dollars daily, commodities  markets trade using digital currency, and In- ternet banking is replacing the need for local,  physical banks.  The threats to networked infrastructures are  on the rise. Countries are beginning to under- stand these threats and are outlining the need  for infrastructure protection, data protection,  defense of the homeland, and other descrip- tors. A comprehensive national cyber security  strategy needs to describe the threats to the  country in economic terms, and outline the  necessary steps, programs, and initiatives that  must be undertaken to address those threats  and protect the Internet connectivity and the  ICT utilized by citizens and private and public  organizations.19 The strategy should be under- pinned by the economic potential of the Inter- net and ICT adoption and include the initiatives  that will help reduce GDP erosion caused by  cyber threats, as well as increase the security  and resilience of the country as a whole.  National cyber security strategies  must reflect the economic  importance of cyber security.  A sound National Cyber Security Strategy  must not be just articulated. It must be ac- tionable. Today, the primary topics reflected  in most strategies include: outlining organi- zational and positional authority within the  government; fostering awareness and edu- cation among citizens; building an incident  and crisis management response capability;  expanding law enforcement’s capacity to  deal with the rate of cyber crimes; facilitating  private-public partnerships and developing  trusted information sharing exchanges; and  marshaling resources toward a R&D and  innovation agenda. Many strategies begin  ©  2015 Cyber Readiness Index 2.0, all rights reserved.  8  with statistics, quantifying incident volume and  the rate of infrastructure infection, and naming  the variety of threats. The data is used to jus- tify organizational responsibility and increased  funding for missions and organizations. Rarely  do these strategies prioritize the services and  infrastructures that are most at risk, nor do  they align the security measures and resource  requirements necessary to reduce exposure  and economic losses. A sound National Cyber  Security Strategy should state the strategic  problem or problems in economic terms; iden- tify and empower the competent authority20  that is accountable for the strategy’s execu- tion; include specific, measurable, attainable,  result-based, and time-based objectives in an  implementation plan; and recognize the need  to commit limited resources (e.g., political will,  money, time, and people) in a competitive  environment to achieve the necessary security  and economic outcomes.  At least sixty-seven countries (with others in de- velopment) have already published their cyber  security strategy, outlining key steps that are  intended to increase their national security and  resilience.21 Many others have national strate- gies (not specific to cyber security) that guide  and coordinate their efforts to advance their  cyber security posture. Few countries, however,  are explicitly linking their economic and nation- al security agendas and specifically addressing  the economic importance of cyber security.  Fewer still are building actionable strategies.  Therefore, all countries have an opportunity to  revise or develop their strategies to reflect the  economic importance of cyber security.  Elements of a comprehensive national cyber  security strategy should include:  Statement:  A. The publication of a national cyber secu- rity strategy that is inclusive of economic  opportunities and risks associated with  ICT uptake;  Organization:  A. The designation of a competent authority  and the clear delineation of its positional  authority;  B. The identification of the key government  entities affected by, and/or responsible  for, the implementation of the national  cyber security strategy;  C. The identification of commercial-sector  entities affected by, and/or, responsible  for the implementation of the national  cyber security strategy (recognizing com- mercial-sector dependencies);  Resources:  A. The identification of the financial and hu- man resources requested and allocated  for the implementation of the strategy;  B. The identification of the percentage of  GDP expected to be gained or lost (gross- ly) by implementing the strategy;  Implementation:  A. The identification of the mechanisms re- quired to secure critical cyber infrastruc- ture and ICT uptake;  9  ©  2015 Cyber Readiness Index 2.0, all rights reserved.  B. The identification of critical services (not  critical infrastructures) that the strategy in- tends to make more secure and resilient;  and  C. The identification of national standards  for continuity of service agreements (24  hours/7 days a week) and outage report- ing requirements for each critical service,  industry, and infrastructure.  The findings in this essential element, as with  the other six areas, represent a snapshot in  time of a dynamic and changing landscape.  As countries continue to develop their national  cyber security strategies, updates to this es- sential element will reflect those changes and  monitor, track, and evaluate substantive and  notable developments. Thus, the CRI 2.0 will  continue to provide a blueprint with new ex- amples to inform others in the formulation or  revision of their strategies.  2. INCIDENT RESPONSE  The second essential element that indicates a  country’s cyber readiness involves establishing  and maintaining an effective national incident  response capability. Often, this capability takes  the form of one or more National Computer  Security Incident Response Teams (National  CSIRTs) or Computer Emergency Response  Teams (CERTs)—hereinafter referred to collec- tively as CSIRTs—responsible for managing in- cident response in the event of natural or man- made cyber-related disasters that affect critical  services and information infrastructures.22 At  present, one hundred and two  national CSIRTs  have been established worldwide and another  four CSIRTs are under development.23 CSIRT  teams usually consist of a blend of IT security  experts and practitioners from academia, the  private sector, and government. In addition to  providing the specific technical competence to  respond to cyber incidents of national interest,  these incident response teams strengthen the  ability of a national government to understand  and combat cyber threats. Operating a Nation- al CSIRT, therefore, forms a core component of  a country’s overall strategy to secure and main- tain the services and infrastructures that are vi- tal to national security and economic growth.24  National CSIRTs, unlike strictly governmental  ones, serve a broad constituency ranging from  government departments to private and public  entities to citizens. A well-established Nation- al CSIRT provides reactive services above all  else—i.e., the ability to respond to incidents  by containing and mitigating incidents as they  occur.25 Although the specific organizational  form of National CSIRTs may vary, and not  every country may have the same needs and  resources, these specialized and dedicated  units should provide a series of both proactive  and reactive functions, as well as preventive,  educational, and security quality management  services. These services include, but are not  limited to: establishing shared understanding  of the threats facing the country; publishing  alerts and advisories on cyber vulnerabilities  and threats; promoting cyber security aware- ness and best practices; identifying, detecting,  containing, and managing security threats and  preparing for potential incidents; coordinating  incident response activities; analyzing comput- er security incidents and providing feedback  and lessons learned (for shared learning); pro- moting activities that increase resilience; and  supporting the national cyber security strategy.  ©  2015 Cyber Readiness Index 2.0, all rights reserved.  10  For example, Singapore’s national CSIRT  (SingCERT) was developed by the Infocomm  Development Authority of Singapore (IDA) in  cooperation with the National University of  Singapore (NUS) in 1997. It has since become  a part of the Cyber Security Agency of Singa- pore (CSA). SingCERT was designed as a one- stop center for incident response; facilitating  the detection, resolution, and prevention of  security related incidents on the Internet. Sing- CERT provides technical assistance and coor- dinates response to cyber security incidents,  identifies and follows cyber intrusion trends,  disseminates timely threat information, and  coordinates with other security agencies to re-  sible for incident response, awareness raising,  data collection on cyber threats and intrusions,  and coordination with multiple stakeholders to  include CSIRTs, academia, and the private sec- tor. In addition, Brazil’s CSIRTs include teams  from the financial sector, military, government,  and universities.28  Apart from national CSIRTs, similar regional  entities have been established to enhance and  coordinate incident response activities within  specific geographic regions. AfricaCERT, for  instance, is a non-profit organization that in- cludes eleven African countries and provides  a forum for cooperation and the exchange of  Resilience of critical services is vital to national  security and economic growth.  solve computer security incidents.26 SingCERT  has also been active in organizing and hosting  Association of South East Asian Nations (ASE- AN) and Asia Pacific Computer Emergency Re- sponse Team (APCERT) exercises. Additionally,  Singapore hosts seven Forum of Incident Re- sponse and Security Teams (FIRST) members.  Brazil’s incident response capabilities consist  of a national computer emergency response  team, CERT.BR, and thirty regional CSIRTs split  across four states, all under the authority of  the Brazilian Internet Steering Committee. This  Committee is a non-governmental, multi-stake- holder organization and the primary entity  responsible for network defense and incident  response in Brazil.27 Brazil’s CERT.BR is respon-  technical information between operators of  Internet-connected networks in the region. Af- ricaCERTs main objectives include, but are not  limited to: coordinating cooperation among  African CSIRTS to handle computer security  incidents; assisting in the establishment of  CSIRTs in countries that currently lack incident  response capabilities; fostering and support- ing incident prevention and educational out- reach programs in ICT security; encouraging  information sharing; and promoting best prac- tices for cyber security. Similarly, the APCERT  comprises a network of twenty-eight member  CERTs and other trusted security experts in  the region, and it aims to enhance awareness  and competency in relation to computer secu- rity incidents and improve incident response  11  ©  2015 Cyber Readiness Index 2.0, all rights reserved.  capabilities across the Asia Pacific region.29  APCERT’s mission is the pursuit of a “clean,  safe, and reliable” cyberspace through global  collaboration. In order to effectively commu- nicate cyber threats, APCERT’s organizational  framework relies on a point-of-contact (POC)  system, in which each country delegates an  APCERT member to serve as a POC during  times of emergency, in order to help facilitate  timely response.30 Likewise, the Organisation  of Islamic Cooperation Computer Emergency  Response Team (OIC-CERT)—which includes  member states in Southeast Asia, South Asia,  the Middle East, Africa, and Central Asia— also works to enhance collaboration between  member state CERTs and OIC-CERT.  In addition to developing incident response  capabilities, countries are also participating in  cyber incident response exercises. These exer- cises help countries practice and develop skills  for effective crisis management and verify the  operational ability of a CSIRT to respond under  pressure. For example, in November 2011, the  German Executive Branch conducted a one- day crisis planning/readiness exercise. The  goal of the exercise was to work out govern- ment response procedures for a multi-pronged  attack that included: distributed denial of ser- vice (DDoS) attacks against critical infrastruc- tures; the injection of malware into the banking  system, causing a crisis with ATMs and credit  cards; and the insertion of false traffic within  the air traffic control system.31 The Swedish Civ- il Contingencies Agency (MSB), the Post and  Telecom Authority (PTS), and the National De- fence Radio Establishment (FRA) also host reg- ular cooperative Chief Information Assurance  Officer (CIAO) courses for relevant employees  working at the senior management levels. The  course culminates in a capstone exercise—a  cyber crisis management simulation—that in- cludes key public and private stakeholders in  the decision making process, to include Parlia- ment and Chief Executive Officers (CEOs) from  companies responsible for Swedish critical  services. The exercise highlights crucial policy  and legal shortfalls, while at the same time  educating all participants on cyber security.32  Additionally, the Czech Republic conducted  an incident response exercise in October 2015  that focused on threats to critical infrastructure,  with a specific emphasis on nuclear power  plants.33  Some countries are also conducting  exercises in reaction to cyber incidents that  have occcured. For example, South Korea’s  President Park Guen-hye ordered cyber war  drills and training for all staff, as a result of  malware found in multiple Korea Hydro and  Nuclear Power (KHNP) plants.34  Furthermore, international exercises test op- erational incident response capabilities while  simulating cooperation between countries. The  United States, for example, conducts a biannu- al Cyber Storm exercise that seeks to strength- en cyber preparedness in the public and pri- vate sectors. Each Cyber Storm exercise builds  on lessons learned from previous real-world  incidents, to ensure that participants have an  opportunity to practice incident response to  ever-more sophisticated cyber incidents. The  2016 Cyber Storm will include sixteen states,  eleven countries, and fourteen federal agen- cies.35 The European Union also holds bian- nual cyber incident response exercises among  member states and the private sector, entitled  Cyber Europe.36 During a 24 hour cyber exer- cise in 2014, Cyber Europe allowed nearly all  European Union member states to test their  response capabilities against as many as two  thousand real-life cyber attacks, to include  DDoS, web defacement attacks, data exfiltra- tion, and cyber attacks against critical infra- structure.37 Moreover, the European Defense  Agency (EDA) and the North America Treaty  ©  2015 Cyber Readiness Index 2.0, all rights reserved.  12  Organization (NATO) also conduct region wide  complex cyber crisis management exercises,  with the goal of strengthening cyber incident  response capacity among member states and  understanding cross-border dependencies.38  The United States and the United Kingdom  also recently announced that they will test how  financial centers on either side of the Atlantic  would respond to a massive cyber attack. The  exercise ran in November 2015 and tested  country response and cross-Atlantic coordina- tion and communication.39  National CSIRTs can also be used as a mech- anism to build confidence between countries  and foster cooperation. For example, China,  Japan, and Korea—three countries that have  historically experienced tensions—have devel- oped a trilateral annual CSIRT meeting to dis- cuss cyber incident response mechanisms. The  meetings have helped instill confidence and  trust resulting in the development of a cyber  “hotline” to communicate on significant cyber  incidents.40  Cyber incident response capabilties, joint  meetings, and exercises are just a few of the  basic mechanisms that can help a country pro- actively prepare for and mitigate the ripple ef- fects of a major cyber incident. CSIRTs increase  a country’s speed, recovery, and resilience  against cyber threats, reducing the likely over- all economic and operational impact of na- tionally significant attacks or campaigns. Some  of the key preconditions for the successful  deployment of these incident response teams  are a well trained staff, and effective rapidly  deployable tools. This facilitates an incident  response team’s ability to foster cooperation  and coordination in incident prevention, en- able rapid reaction to incidents, and promote  information sharing among stakeholders, both  domestically and internationally.  Elements of a sound national incident response  capability should include:  Statement:  A. The publication of an incident response  plan for emergencies and crises;  B. The identification and mapping of  cross-sector dependencies that address  continuity of operations and disaster re- covery mechanisms;  C. Evidence that the plan is exercised and  updated regularly;  D. The publication and dissemination of a  national cyber threat assessment(s) on  government, critical infrastructures, and  essential services networks;  Organization:  A. The establishment of a national CSIRT  to manage incident response and serve  a broad national constituency (beyond  government and critical infrastructure  providers);  B. The identification of a network of author- itative national contact points for govern- mental and regulatory bodies;  C. The identification of a network of author- itative national contact points for critical  industries that are essential for the oper- ation and recovery of critical services and  infrastructures;  D. The development of an information warn- ing and alert system that can be used by  national crisis/response centers to effec- tively receive, address, and transmit ur- gent information in a timely manner;  13  ©  2015 Cyber Readiness Index 2.0, all rights reserved.  Resources:  A. The identification of the financial and  human resources requested and allocat- ed for the National CSIRT to carry out its  mandate;  B. The identification of additional funding  to activate and regularly test the infor- mation warning and alert system, and to  measure the country’s resilience to cyber  incidents and crisis through national cy- ber security exercises;  Implementation:  A. A demonstrated capability in the incident  containment, management, resilience,  and recovery processes for critical ser- vices and infrastructures;  B. A demonstrated ability by national crisis/ response centers to address and transmit  alerts in a timely manner;  C. Evidence of ongoing research methods  analyzing trends or groups of comput- er security incidents of national con- cern—sharing similar actors or tactics,  techniques, and procedures—in order to  identify patterns; and  D. The development and implementation of  a system/program to regularly test and  measure the nation’s resilience to cyber  incidents and crises through national cy- ber security exercises.  Initial findings in this essential element are  based on the inventories of National CSIRTs  provided by the CERT Division at Carnegie  Mellon University (CMU),41 the European  Network and Information Security Agency  (ENISA),42 FIRST,43 and the ITU. Additional pri- mary and secondary sources, such as National  CSIRT’s websites and related news articles,  are consulted to determine if the capabili- ties exist and are funded. As countries come  to recognize the importance of establishing  National CSIRTs, updates to this essential el- ement will monitor, track, and evaluate those  developments.  3. E-CRIME AND LAW  ENFORCEMENT  The third essential element that indicates a  country’s cyber readiness is demonstrated  through its commitment to protect its society  against cyber crime. Cyber crime is not simply  a domestic issue; it transcends national bor- ders and therefore requires transnational solu- tions. Countries must show an international  commitment to secure society against e-crime.  Most often, this capability takes the form of  involvement with international fora dedicated  to addressing international cyber crime issues,  as well as the establishment of domestic legal  and regulatory mechanisms to combat cyber  crime. The pertinent legal and regulatory au- thorities designated with carrying out such  activities should define what constitutes a cy- ber crime and empower governmental entities  with the mechanisms, expertise, and resources  to investigate and effectively prosecute cyber  crime activities.  Two international treaty agreements help  demonstrate a country’s commitment to pro- tecting society against cyber crime: the Coun- cil of Europe’s “Convention on Cyber Crime”  and the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation’s  “Agreement on Cooperation in the Field on  Ensuring International Information Securi- ty”. The Council of Europe’s “Convention on  Cybercrime”, in force since July 1, 2004 and  ©  2015 Cyber Readiness Index 2.0, all rights reserved.  14  commonly called the Budapest Convention,  provides a mechanism through which to har- monize divergent national cyber crime laws and  encourage law enforcement collaboration.44  The effectiveness of the Budapest Convention  is somewhat limited because it allows signato- ry countries to selectively implement elements  of the Budapest Convention based upon find- ings that doing otherwise would “prejudice its  sovereignty, security, public order or other es- sential interests.”45 The Shanghai Cooperation  Organisation’s “Agreement on Cooperation in  the Field on Ensuring International Information  Security,” signed in 2009 and sometimes re- ferred to as the Yekaterinburg Agreement, has  principles consistent with the law enforcement  approach of the Budapest Convention. It too  seeks to improve the informational legal base  and establish practical mechanisms of coop- eration among the parties in ensuring interna- tional information security.46 Pursuant to these  treaties, countries agree to adopt appropriate  legislation, foster international cooperation,  and combat criminal offenses, by facilitating  their detection, investigation, and prosecution  both nationally and internationally. CRI 2.0  credits countries that have ratified or acceded  to either of these treaties because by doing so  a country has a specific obligation and duty un- der its domestic law to uphold a commitment  in an international context.  In addition to the international mechanisms  noted above, other international, multi-na- tional, and regional approaches towards ad- dressing international cyber crime exist and  are being pursued. For example, the United  Nations General Assembly (UNGA) has passed  a variety of resolutions relevant to cyber crime,  such as the 2001 “Combating the Criminal Mis- use of Information Technology,” and the 2003  “Creation of a Global Culture of Cybersecurity  and the Protection of Critical Infrastructures.”47  Notably, the UN Group of Government Experts  (GGE) that consists of twenty countries had a  break through moment when they agreed to  cooperate on prosecuting terrorist and criminal  use of ICT. Their commitments are codified in  the June 2015 GGE report On Developments  in the Field of Information and Telecommunica- tions in the Context of International Security.48  The APEC also conducted a capacity-building  project on cyber crime for member economies  to establish legal structures and build capacity  to investigate e-crime. As part of this project,  advanced APEC economies support other  member-economies by training legislative au- thorities and investigative personnel.49  The CRI 2.0 draws upon these international,  multi-national, and regional approaches to  assess a country’s cyber readiness. In addition,  the CRI 2.0 also includes country information  on cyber crime from the ASEAN, and the ITU,  among others.  While the intention to cooperate on cyber  crime may exist and the ratification of cyber  crime agreements is important, it does not  necessarily demonstrate readiness to combat  cyber crime. States must also work to proac- tively build domestic cyber law enforcement  capacity. For instance, the Advanced Centre  for Research, Development and Training in  Cyber Law and Forensics at the National Law  School of India University in Bangalore works  to translate the law into technical terms and  vice-versa by providing training and education  to judicial officers, prosecutors, investigative  agencies, cyber security personnel, technolo- gists, and others. Funded by the Department  of Electronics and Information Technology (De- itY) in the Indian Ministry of Communications  and Information Technology, the Centre pro- vides a unique hands-on training component  15  ©  2015 Cyber Readiness Index 2.0, all rights reserved.  in a cyber forensics lab that facilitates rapid  understanding of complex issues.50  Another example is the International Police  Organization’s (INTERPOL) recent launch of  an INTERPOL Global Complex for Innovation  (IGCI) in Singapore. This facility enables law  enforcement officials to partner with industry  to develop new training techniques and use  advanced tools to tackle cyber crime and  boost cyber security.51 For example, INTER- POL created a simulation game to teach law  enforcement officials about the intersection  and risk of the Darknet and crypto-currencies.  The Darknet has enabled an underground (il- legal) economy that sells personal identifiable  information (PII), military intelligence, weapons  designs, modular malware, zero-day exploits,  private encryption keys and credentials, and  many other types of illegally obtained data.  INTERPOL’s first simulation/training exercise  was conducted in July 2015.52  Apart from building e-crime and law en- forcement capacity, states must also work to  clean the infections in their networked infra- structures, known as botnets.53 Currently, an  estimated five to twelve percent of comput- ers worldwide are compromised as a part  of a botnet network. The FBI estimates that  eighteen systems are infected per second via  botnet armies, causing an estimated $110  billion in damages globally.54 Some countries  have worked to address this threat, with some  success. For example, the Canadian Govern- ment’s DarkSpace Project-Advanced Analytics  and Dark Space Analysis for Predictive Indica- tors of Cyber Activity—spearheaded by Bell  Canada and involving a team of experts from  Canadian government agencies, academic in- stitutions, and industry—made a business case  for a ‘clean pipes’ solution to cyber threats  by providing a compelling body of evidence  to support proactively containing threats to  Canada coming from the Internet. Findings  from the project made the business case for  a national clean pipes strategy and influenced  a Cyber Security Standard for Telecommuni- cations Service Providers.55 Another example,  in Japan, was The Cyber Clean Center, a five- year funded effort, operated by the Japanese  CERT (JPCERT) from 2006 to 2011.56 This Cen- ter was the result of a cross-disciplinary col- laboration among JP-CERT, various security  vendors, and Internet service providers (ISPs);  it created an automated “guardian network”  against botnet malware infection and exploita- tion. It also further provided tailor-made solu- tions to address specific malware on specific  computers.57 The Cyber Clean Center’s efforts  have continued at Telecom-ISAC Japan.58 Fi- nally, Australia’s iCode, a public-private part- nership through the Australian Internet Secu- rity Initiative (AISI), aims to promote a security  culture among ISPs by reducing the number of  compromised computing devices in Australia.  The iCode encourages all Australian ISPs to  Cyber crime and fraud are a  tax on economic growth.  Reducing the number of  infected networked devices  is an important investment  in combatting e-crime.  ©  2015 Cyber Readiness Index 2.0, all rights reserved.  16  join AISI, and provides AISI ISP members with  daily malware infection and service vulnerabil- ity data.59  Cyber crime and fraud are a tax on economic  growth. Cyber crime has reached an estimated  $445 billion worldwide, with a negative impact  on national economies of at least 1 percent of  GDP and upwards of two hundred thousand  lost jobs.60 An investment in combating cyber  crime and increasing law enforcement capacity  is a necessary investment for the economy. By  developing law enforcement capabilities to  fight e-crime through the ratification of treaty  documents, international cooperation, capac- ity development, the implementation of an- ti-botnet programs, and other initiatives, coun- tries can mitigate their cyber risks and boost  future economic growth.  Essential elements of a sound country-level  and international commitment to protecting  society against cyber crime should include:  Statement:  A. A demonstrated national and internation- al commitment to protect society against  cyber crime through ratifying international  cyber crime agreements or other equiva- lent agreement to fight cyber crime;  B. A demonstrated commitment to establish  national legal and policy mechanisms to  specifically reduce the criminal activity  emanating from the country and promote  coordination mechanisms to address in- ternational and national cyber crime;  Organization:  A. The establishment of a mature institution- al ability to fight cyber crime, including  training for court judges, prosecutors,  lawyers, law enforcement officials, foren- sic specialists, and other investigators;  B. The establishment of a coordinating agen- cy with a primary mission and authority to  ensure that all international cyber crime  requirements are being met domesti- cally and across jurisdictional lines (i.e.,  cross-border cooperation);  Resources:  A. The identification of financial and human  resources requested and allocated for  fighting cyber crime;  B. The establishment of an accounting  mechanism to determine what percent- age of annual GDP is affected by cyber  crime (actual loss in real currency), in or- der to assess national systemic cost-ben- efit tradeoffs and allocate resources  accordingly;  Implementation:  A. Demonstrable evidence of a country’s  commitment to review and update ex- isting laws and regulatory governance  mechanisms, identify where gaps and  overlapping authorities may reside, and  clarify and prioritize areas that require  modernization (e.g. existing laws, such as  old telecommunications law);  B. The establishment of criminal offenses  under domestic law for actions directed  against the confidentiality, integrity, and  availability of computer systems, net- works, and computer data as well as the  misuse of such systems, networks, and  data, to include the international infringe- ment of copyright; and  17  ©  2015 Cyber Readiness Index 2.0, all rights reserved.  C. Demonstrable evidence of a country’s  effectiveness in reducing infections em- anating from its own infrastructures and  networks (e.g. creation of anti-botnet and  malware remediation initiatives).  Initial findings in this essential element are  based upon a review of whether a country has  ratified or acceded to the Budapest Conven- tion or the Shanghai Cooperation Organisa- tion’s Yekaterinburg Agreement and whether  the country is an active participant in regional,  multi-national, or international approaches  towards addressing cyber crime. Additionally,  current botnet activity (both command and  attacks—which can have significant implica- tions for global telecommunications, trade,  and business—requires more than traditional  monitoring and protection mechanisms. Glob- ally, most governments and organizations have  established information sharing programs to  better understand risks posed by state and  non-state actors and managed their exposure  to vulnerabilities and subsequent infections  and breaches.  Formal information sharing mechanisms, simi- lar to some of the services provided by Nation- al CSIRTs and CERTs, can help foster coordi- nation in incident response, facilitate real-time  Information sharing must be underpinned by  trust and buy-in from all stakeholders.  control nodes and total infections) emanating  from the country is used to assess the effec- tiveness of anti-botnet initiatives. The CRI 2.0  draws on primary and secondary sources to  determine whether a country has established  legal and regulatory mechanisms, other risk  reduction activities, and allocated funding to  ensure successful execution. Updates to this  essential element will monitor, track, and eval- uate substantive and notable developments.  4. INFORMATION SHARING  The fourth element that indicates a country’s  cyber readiness is its ability to establish and  maintain information sharing mechanisms that  enable the exchange of actionable intelligence  and/or information between governments and  industry sectors. Key activities such as identi- fying, assessing, and responding to targeted  sharing of threat and intelligence information,  and help improve understanding of how sec- tors are targeted, what information is lost, and  what methods can be used to defend informa- tion assets. At least four different models for  information sharing have emerged to address  cyber threats and to help entities secure their  information assets: (1) government driven; (2)  industry driven; (3) non-profit-partnership driv- en; and (4) a hybrid academic-, government-,  and industry-partnership driven model. Each  method has its unique challenges, such as  balancing the need for exchanging timely and  actionable cyber security information while  protecting data’s confidentiality, safeguarding  civil liberties, and managing competing finan- cial and human resources and interests. Two  factors, however, are required for any of the  four models to succeed: buy-in and trust, which  must be underpinned by clearly defined objec-  ©  2015 Cyber Readiness Index 2.0, all rights reserved.  18  tives, roles, responsibilities, and outcomes. Put  simply, when a party participates reluctantly or  defensively, success is hard to achieve.61  Moreover, stakeholders must be able to share  valuable information on serious incidents,  which requires clear definitions of what type  of information should be shared, who will  have access to it, and what security measures  should be taken to protect the information  once released by its original owner. The com- plexity of this sensitive information exchange  grows proportionately with group size, and  perhaps exponentially when those group  members are sovereign states with distinct  national security concerns.  Many individual countries have already de- veloped strong national information sharing  programs that could be leveraged as good  practices for other countries to learn from.  These programs tend to focus on aligning sim- ilar stakeholders into groups and subsequently  aligning the groups into a national program.  The Netherlands, for instance, created the  National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC)—a  government driven initiative that evolved from  the Dutch GOVCERT into a successful pub- lic-private partnership—responsible for digital  security and information sharing in the coun- try.62 One of its main tasks is to continuously  monitor all (potentially) suspect sources on the  Internet and alert public authorities and orga- nizations of any identified cyber threat. NCSC  is also directly connected to all Information  Sharing and Analyses Centres (ISACs) in the  country and information is shared under the  Traffic Light Protocol (TLP), which classifies in- formation into four levels: red, yellow, green,  and white. The Dutch information sharing pro- gram was modeled after the United Kingdom  National Infrastructure Security Coordination  Centre (NISCC), which delivered focused in- formation security advice to critical national  infrastructure businesses.63 Similarly, Japan’s  Information-Technology Promotion Agency  (IPA), acts as the institutional authority charged  with sharing information between govern- ment and critical industries, and has a proven  track record establishing trusted relationships  with all major companies in the country and  providing timely and effective intelligence. In  addition, IPA works closely with the Ministry of  Economy, Trade, and Industry (METI), the Na- tional Information Security Center (NISC), and  the Cyber Rescue Advice Team (J-CRAT) to  respond to all major cyber incidents affecting  critical infrastructure.64  Alternatively, in the United States, the Finan- cial Services Information Sharing and Analysis  Center (FS-ISAC)—an industry driven initiative  developed by the financial services sector— helps facilitate the detection, prevention, and  response to cyber incidents and fraud activity.  It has built strong ties with financial service pro- viders; commercial security firms; federal/na- tional, state, and local government agencies;  law enforcement; and other trusted entities to  provide reliable and timely cyber threat alerts  and other critical information to member firms  worldwide. As part of these efforts, FS-ISAC  uses a different Traffic Light Protocol to deter- mine which audiences can and should receive  specific information.65 FS-ISAC is expanding  its threat information sharing internationally to  the United Kingdom and Europe. Other ISAC’s  also exist across many sectors, however are not  as effective.  The National Cyber-Forensics and Training Alli- ance (NCFTA) in the United States is a non-profit  19  ©  2015 Cyber Readiness Index 2.0, all rights reserved.  corporation with a mission to facilitate collabora- tion among private industry, academia, and law  enforcement to identify, mitigate, and neutralize  complex cyber-related threats. In addition to  state and local law enforcement and industry  representatives, this non-profit partnership-driv- en initiative enjoys international representation  from Canada, Australia, United Kingdom, India,  Germany, the Netherlands, Ukraine, and Lithu- ania. NCFTA provides streamlined and timely  exchange of cyber threat intelligence to corpo- rations, and also partners with subject matter  experts in the public, private, law enforcement,  and academic sectors to mitigate risks and  fraudulent activities and gather the evidence  necessary to prosecute criminals.66  cies collect valuable cyber-related information,  and some have started to declassify this type  of intelligence and share it with other govern- ment entities and critical industries. Indeed,  real-time situational awareness is often key  to prevent or mitigate specific cyber threats.  Some countries, such as Brazil, have devised  mechanisms to declassify (write-for-release)  actionable information alerting other entities  (public and private) to vulnerabilities, specific  threats and tactics, and potential defensive  solutions as part of their information sharing  initiatives.67 Enhancing the defensive posture  of the country is essential and some countries  are willing to declassify portions of intelligence  to better ensure security.  The ability of a country to exchange timely,  accurate, and actionable information—within  and between public and private sector entities  —helps reduce vulnerabilities and exposure  that can subsequently reduce attendant risks.  As information sharing increases in frequency  and quality, entities should be able to address  cyber threats to their networked infrastructures  in a faster and more proactive manner. Estab- lishing and maintaining actionable information  sharing programs is a fundamental investment  for economic growth.  Elements of an effective national, cross-sector,  and actionable information sharing program  should include:  Statement:  A. The articulation and dissemination of a  policy on information sharing across sec- tors that enables the exchange of action- able intelligence/information between  governments and industry sectors;  Real-time actionable information  is key to mitigating cyber threats.  Finally, Norway’s Center for Cyber and Infor- mation Security (CCIS) at Gjøvik University Col- lege is a joint initiative (academia, government,  and industry) and represents another approach  to information sharing and collaboration on  cyber security. CCIS promotes a systematic  country-wide approach to cyber and informa- tion security and provides information sharing  schema to safeguard society’s ability to de- tect, alert, and handle serious cyber incidents.  Additionally, it supports high quality national  research and development of solutions in the  field of cyber and information security.  In addition to the various information sharing  programs that countries are developing, most  governments’ defense and intelligence agen-  ©  2015 Cyber Readiness Index 2.0, all rights reserved.  20  Organization:  A. The identification of an institutional struc- ture that transmits authoritative informa- tion from government sources to gov- ernment agencies and critical industries  (Government-to-Government);  B. The identification of an institutional struc- ture that ensures that mechanisms exist  (reporting schema, technology, etc.) for  cross-sector incident information ex- change (bi-directional), both operational  (near-real-time) and forensic (post-facto)  (Government-Industry/Industry-Industry);  C. The establishment of an academic or  non-profit driven mechanism for vulner- ability, incident, or solution information  exchange (alternative model, for exam- ple, NCFTA or the National Vulnerability  Database);68  Resources:  A. The identification of the financial and hu- man resources requested and allocated  for the government driven authoritative  information exchange or other institution- al structure(s) dedicated to the informa- tion sharing mechanisms;  Implementation:  A. Demonstrable evidence that cross-sec- tor and cross-stakeholder coordination  mechanisms meant to address critical  interdependencies—including incident  situational awareness and cross-sector  and cross-stakeholder incident manage- ment—are adequately maintained and  tested for effective performance; and  B. Demonstrable evidence of the ability and  timely processes for the government to  declassify (write-for-release) usable cy- ber-related intelligence information and  share it with the rest of government and  critical industries.69  Initial findings in this essential element are  based upon a review of whether a country has  established information sharing and other co- ordination mechanisms. Drawing upon primary  and secondary sources, the CRI 2.0 determines  whether such mechanisms exist and are prop- erly funded. Updates to this essential element  will monitor, track, and evaluate substantive  and notable developments.  5. INVESTMENT IN RESEARCH  AND DEVELOPMENT  The fifth element that indicates a country’s cy- ber readiness is establishing a national priority  for and investment in cyber security basic and  applied research and ICT initiatives broadly.  Advances in ICT have revolutionized almost  every sector of the economy, transforming  businesses, governments, education, and the  way citizens live, work, and play. These innova- tions drive economic growth and can enhance  resilience and set the conditions for a strong  security posture.  Government and businesses each have a role  to play and can combine the power of their  R&D budgets to enhance the next generation  of ICT and Internet-enabled technologies and  solutions. Businesses and governments are em- bracing mobile Internet, cloud computing, big  data, quantum computing, and the Internet of  Things (IoT), and must invest in the trust, secu- rity, and resilience of these digital services and  technologies. By investing in cyber R&D and  21  ©  2015 Cyber Readiness Index 2.0, all rights reserved.  other innovations, countries, universities, and  companies can improve their ability to close  the gap between their cyber insecurity and at- tacker capabilities. For example, the European  Union’s Horizon 2020 program has allocated  an estimated €80 billion for research and tech- nological development initiatives. With the Eu- ropean Union’s foundational principle of open  access, the program intends to boost research  results, accelerate innovation, create greater  efficiency, and improve transparency. Horizon  2020 has three main components. The first area  focuses on basic and applied science, entitled,  “Excellent Science,” and plans to fund doctoral  training for an additional twenty-five thousand  PhD candidates during the next seven years.  The second area focuses on “Leadership in  Enabling and Industrial Technologies,” with an  emphasis on ICT, nanotechnologies, advanced  materials, and processing, among others. The  third area funds solutions to address social and  economic problems, such as health, energy,  transportation, and security. One of the evalu- ation criteria for this investment is transnational  cooperation among companies and solutions  that meet pan-European needs.70  cyber-physical systems, cyber security and  privacy R&D, high-end computing, and wire- less-spectrum sharing.71 The NITRD program is  the United State’s primary source of federally  funded work on advanced information technol- ogies in computing, networking, and software.  The program seeks to accelerate the develop- ment and deployment of advanced information  technologies to enhance national defense and  homeland security as well as improve United  States productivity and economic competi- tiveness. Additionally, the Defense Advanced  Research Projects Agency (DARPA), the Intel- ligence Advanced Research Projects Activity  (IARPA), and the Homeland Security Advanced  Research Projects Agency (HSARPA) also have  funding dedicated to cyber R&D. However, if  the entire cyber R&D budget were to be add- ed together, the total amount would still be  the equivalent of less than 1 percent of United  States GDP. Based on the enormity of current  and future United States cyber risks, 1 percent  of GDP is inadequate to close the cyber inse- curity gap.  Other government-sponsored initiatives en- courage cyber security innovation by offering  market incentives such as R&D tax credits. For  instance, recognizing that spurring organiza- tional and corporate investment often requires  government encouragement and commit- ment, Israel recently approved significant tax  breaks for cyber defense companies that join  and establish activities at their national cyber  park in Be’er Sheva.72 By encouraging a unique  industry-academia-military ecosystem through  the co-location of technical talent, Israel is cre- ating an economic and strategic cyber security  hub. Be’er Sheva’s cyber park also increases  private-public partnerships in the cyber field;  serves as a center of excellence for innovation;  and provides an effective training and employ- ment pipeline.  Cyber security R&D innovation  must enhance the trust,  security, and resilience of our  future networked society.  Similarly, the United States prioritizes, coordi- nates, and dedicates over $4 billion annually  toward cross-cutting research through the Na- tional Information Technology and Research  and Development (NITRD) program. Priority  research areas for 2016-2020 include: big data,  ©  2015 Cyber Readiness Index 2.0, all rights reserved.  22  Grants and scholarships are another market  mechanism used to advance cyber security ed- ucation, develop knowledge, and build skills.  For instance, the Brazilian government’s “Sci- ence without Borders” program offers schol- arships in all STEM fields, including computer  science and information technology. Likewise,  the National Council for Scientific and Techno- logical Development (CNPq), an agency within  the Ministry of Science, Technology, and Inno- vation, provides a “Science Initiation Schol- arship” to incentivize ICT education in young  students.73  Cyber Incident Experience Lab. Current proj- ects include building an advanced malware  detection platform and delivering solutions  for detecting, reporting, and managing cyber  vulnerabilities through qualitative scanners.74  Other private sector “cyber innovation hubs”  have emerged in Silicon Valley, Tel Aviv, Bos- ton, New York City, and London. For instance,  London’s cyber innovation hub, titled CyLon or  Cyber London, is Europe’s first cyber security  startup accelerator. CyLon works to foster the  cyber innovation ecosystem in London and  helps businesses develop information security  related products.75  These various R&D initiatives and cyber inno- vation hubs accelerate the transfer of ideas  and technologies into solutions to advance  the digital marketplace, improve the security  and resilience of underlying networks and in- frastructures, and improve societal well being.  Elements of a country’s commitment to ad- vance its cyber R&D, education, and capacity  building efforts should include:  Statement:  A. A publicly announced commitment by the  government to invest nationally in cyber  security basic and applied research;  B. Publicly announced incentive mechanisms  (e.g., R&D tax credit) to encourage cyber  security innovation and dissemination  of new findings, baseline technologies,  techniques, processes, and tools;  Cyber Innovation hubs accelerate  the transfer of ideas and  technologies into solutions.  Cyber security innovation centers, such as  the Hague Security Delta (HSD), foster in- novative cyber security R&D and promote  collaboration among private sector compa- nies, governments, and research institutions.  HSD, a foundation supported by the Munic- ipality of the Hague and the Dutch Ministry  of Economic Affairs, is the largest security  network in Europe with knowledge bridges  to the main security networks in the United  States, Canada, Singapore, and South Africa.  Its cyber security program includes initiatives  such as the Cyber Security Academy and the  23  ©  2015 Cyber Readiness Index 2.0, all rights reserved.  C. Publicly announced government incen- tive mechanisms (e.g., grants, scholar- ships) to encourage cyber security ed- ucation, knowledge creation, and skills  development;  Organization:  A. The identification of at least one entity  with the responsibility to oversee national  cyber security R&D initiatives and serve as  a national and international point-of-con- tact for collaboration;  B. The establishment of institutionally sup- ported degree programs in cyber security,  information security or similar advanced  technology areas that focus on security  and resilience of the digital environment;  C. The establishment of an entity with the  mission to measure and report on the rate  of government or commercial successfully  transitioned programs (from research to  product/service) with a focus on the solu- tions that improve security and resilience  of the digital environment;  Resources:  A. The identification of financial and human  resources requested and allocated for  cyber security basic and applied research  and initiatives;  B. The identification of financial and human  resources requested and allocated for  commercial or government transfer of en- hanced technology and innovation;  Implementation:  A. The implementation of programs dedi- cated to the development, dissemination,  and routinization of interoperable and  secure technical standards, acceptable to  and reinforced by internationally recog- nized standards bodies;  B. Evidence of national government efforts  to support, advance, and sustain cyber  security R&D, especially as demonstrated  in terms of the research/production con- version rate (e.g., percentage implement- ed operationally within the government)  and of the commercial adoption rate of  successfully transitioned programs; and  C. Evidence of additional commercial efforts  (e.g. cyber innovation hubs) to support,  advance, and sustain cyber security R&D,  especially in terms of the research/product  conversion rate (e.g. percentage imple- mented operationally within the private  sector) and of the government adoption  rate of successfully transitioned programs  from the commercial sector.  Initial findings in this essential element are  based upon a review of whether a country is  investing in cyber R&D, education, knowledge  creation, and skills development—in addi- tion to funding cyber security initiatives more  broadly. Drawing on primary and secondary  sources, the CRI 2.0 determines the type, if  any, of government incentive mechanisms al- ready in place and the resources dedicated to  initiatives similar to the ones discussed above.  Updates to this essential element will monitor,  track, and evaluate substantive and notable  developments.  ©  2015 Cyber Readiness Index 2.0, all rights reserved.  24  6. DIPLOMACY AND TRADE  The sixth essential element of cyber readiness  is demonstrated through a country’s engage- ment with cyber issues as part of its foreign  policy. At a fundamental level, cyber diplo- macy seeks to find mutually acceptable solu- tions to common challenges. Cyber issues are  emerging in many different international rela- tions areas including human rights, economic  development, trade agreements, arms control  and dual use technologies, security, stability,  and peace and conflict resolution. While cyber  security issues are entangled in almost every  topic and most negotiators are experts in a  specific topic area (i.e., trade or arms control),  those experts are often not familiar with the  added opportunities or risks that emerge in a  cyber context. Therefore, establishing a dedi- cated office or personnel whose primary focus  is diplomatic engagement on cyber issues  should be an integral component of a country’s  foreign policy.  Given the slow pace of the economic recovery,  many countries are pursuing new international  economic policies enshrined in trade agree- ments as a means to accelerate growth and  create market opportunities. Yet, these eco- nomic initiatives are becoming venues where  national security concerns are being negoti- ated, sub-rosa. For example, the Trans-Pacific  Partnership (TPP) agreement was reached on  5 October 2015. The agreement’s objective is  to enhance trade and investment among TPP  partner countries, promote innovation, eco- nomic growth and development, and support  the creation and retention of jobs. It took five  years to reach this agreement, in part because  of cyber issues. Partner countries could not  agree on key issues, including data protection  and privacy requirements (e.g., intellectual  property protection), data localization desires,  and content restrictions.  The United States and the European Union  are negotiating a Transatlantic Trade and In- vestment Partnership (TTIP), which is a similar  agreement to the TPP. This agreement seeks to  increase market access, eliminate unnecessary  regulatory hurdles, establish rules to govern the  entangled commercial relationships between  the two regions, create jobs, and promote GDP  growth.76 Two of the core issues that are de- laying this negotiation are data protection and  At a fundamental level, cyber  diplomacy seeks to find  mutually acceptable solutions  to common challenges.  privacy. For the past decade, Europe and the  United States have agreed to common protec- tion standards for the transfer and storage of  all personal data, which moves and/or resides  between the European Union and the United  States.77 However, the leaked documents by  Edward Snowden exposed the United States  government’s intelligence services’ collection  activities on other governments and citizens,  leading to a breakdown of trust among and be- tween governments. As a result, many Europe- an countries are demanding the establishment  of mutual state-level privacy standards, encryp- tion rules, and legal frameworks, in order to  keep pace with rapidly advancing technology  and also hold states accountable for adequate  protection of the data. Additionally, a recent  Court of Justice of the European Union ruling  has negated the long-standing agreement  of “Safe Harbor” data protection standards  between the European Union and the United  States. The Safe Harbor executive decision had  25  ©  2015 Cyber Readiness Index 2.0, all rights reserved.  allowed United States companies to self-certify  to provide “adequate protection” for Europe- an users’ data in compliance with the European  data protection directive and with fundamental  European rights, such as privacy. While negoti- ations are ongoing to update Safe Harbor, no  time frame has been provided for completion,  further complicating TTIP negotiations.78 At  present, the American Chamber of Commerce  to the European Union estimates that reversing  Safe Harbor could cost the European Union up  to 1.3 percent of GDP.79  Another regionally based free trade agree- ment, the Regional Comprehensive Economic  Partnership (RCEP) is currently under negoti- ation among ASEAN member states, China,  India, Japan, Korea, Australia, and New Zea- land. The sixteen participating RCEP countries  account for almost half of the world’s popula- tion, nearly 30 percent of global GDP, and over  one quarter of the world exports. The goal of  the RCEP is to lower trade barriers, promote  economic and technical cooperation, protect  intellectual property, encourage competition,  facilitate dispute settlement, and improve mar- ket access for exporters of goods and services.  As part of these negotiations, some countries  are seeking to include mechanisms that protect  their data, asserting a right to data sovereignty  for national security purposes.80  There is also an entire series of negotiations  underway in the security arena, focusing upon  technologies. For example, the Wassenaar  Arrangement on Export Controls for Conven- tional Arms and Dual-Use Goods and Technol- ogies, which has forty-one signatories including  the United States, United Kingdom, Russia, and  most European Union states, recently agreed  to curb the sale of Internet “communications  surveillance systems” and “intrusion software”  that are specially designed or modified to  avoid detection by monitoring tools, or to de- feat protective countermeasures.81 States have  different concerns on the dual-purpose appli- cations of these technologies. For instance, a  vulnerability assessment tool often uses zero  day exploitations to discover networked vulner- abilities. These same techniques can be used  as weapons. Therefore, bringing these technol- ogies under export control regimes reflects the  belief that advanced technologies may defeat  countries’ national defenses and present a na- tional security risk.  Other diplomatic negotiations and discussions  are ongoing that seek to establish a common  understanding and/or rules to increase stabili- ty and security in the global ICT environment.  This includes strengthening cooperative mech- anisms to address ICT security incidents and  address ICT infrastructure-related requests  (e.g., illegal activity emitting from a country  due to a bot-net infection). Diplomacy is also  being used to define what type of cyber activ- ities should and should not be permitted (e.g.,  standards for responsible state behavior), com- monly referred to as cyber norms of behavior.  For example, the United Nations GGE recently  highlighted the global nature of the ICT envi- ronment, existing and potential threats in the  sphere of information security, and possible  cooperative measures to address those threats.  The GGE found that adherence to internation- al law, particularly UN Charter obligations,  provides an essential framework for states’ ICT  use. They agreed to pursue a framework for  cyber norms, rules or principles for responsible  state behavior, and confidence-building mea- sures (CBMs).82 Among the CBMs, the GGE  agreed to strengthen cooperative mechanisms  between relevant state agencies in order to  address ICT security incidents and develop ad- ditional technical, legal, and diplomatic mech- anisms to address ICT infrastructure-related  ©  2015 Cyber Readiness Index 2.0, all rights reserved.  26  requests (e.g., establish a CSIRT or other offi- cial organization to fulfill such roles). Most re- cently, United States President Barack Obama  and Chinese President Xi Jinping agreed (in  principle) to follow the GGE recommendations  and adhere to UN-established norms of online  behavior; especially those governing the use  of cyber attacks to harm the other’s critical in- frastructure during peacetime.83  Building upon some of the common themes  from the GGE, the leaders of Brazil, Russian,  India, China, and South Africa (BRICS) agreed  to cooperate with each other in order to ad- dress common ICT security challenges. They  agreed to share information and best practices  relating to the security of ICT use, coordinate  against cyber crime, es- tablish a POC network  in member-states, and  establish intra-BRICS co- operation using the ex- isting CSIRTs. They also  urged the international  community to focus its  efforts on CBMs, capac- ity building, the non-use  of force, and the pre- vention of ICT enabled conflicts.84 Moreover,  in January 2015, the SCO introduced a revised  international code of conduct for information  security to the UNGA, which sought to identify  the rights and responsibilities of states in the  information space, promote constructive and  responsive behavior, and enhance coopera- tion to address mutual ICT threats.85 The SCO  revised the 2011 Code of Conduct language  with language from the 2012 and 2013 GGE  reports, in order to broaden appeal for the  Code of Conduct among G-77 members.  Other international venues co-mingle econom- ic, development, and security topics as they  pursue specific goals. The ITU, for example,  carries out regular international discussions  on the policy, technology, and regulatory en- vironment of ICT and the Internet during four  of its global meetings: the World Summit on  the Information Society (WSIS), the World Con- ference on International Telecommunications  (WCIT), the World Telecommunication Devel- opment Conference (WTDC), and the World  Telecommunications Standardization Assem- bly (WTSA).86 In addition, the OAS and the IDB  have joined forces to work with their member  states to systematically address cyber security  as part of three issue areas: (1) development  that is both socially inclusive and environmen- tally sustainable; (2) ICT as a tool to generate  income and employment, provide access to  businesses and infor- mation, enable e-learn- ing, and facilitate gov- ernment activities; and  (3) security of their core  infrastructures and citi- zen facing services.87  Clearly, cyber security  issues are emerging  across a wide variety of  diplomatic venues. Cyber security is not only a  security problem; it is a fundamental element  of trade, foreign and economic policy, and a  country’s future economic growth potential.  Key components of a country’s ability to ef- fectively engage diplomatically on cyber-re- lated issues include the establishment of a  dedicated and trained cadre of personnel, the  development of specific organizational struc- tures, and the allocation of funding devoted to  international discussions and negotiations on  issues pertaining to cyber security. For exam- ple, Israel and the Czech Republic have placed  cyber attachés in their embassies in key cities,  to include Washington DC and Brussels.88  Cyber security is entangled  in all components of  foreign policy and trade.  27  ©  2015 Cyber Readiness Index 2.0, all rights reserved.  Additionally, the United States conducted a  one-week training cyber awareness program  for diplomatic personnel assigned to Asia.89  Developing this cadre of personnel is increas- ingly essential for a country to realize its future  foreign policy, economic policy, trade, and  economic growth goals.  Elements of a sound diplomatic cyber security  engagement capability should include:  Statement:  A. The announced identification of cyber se- curity as an essential element of foreign  policy and national security (e.g. Official  discussions typically involving high-level  political and military leaders in bilateral  and multilateral discussions);  B. The announced identification of ICT and  cyber security as an essential element of  international economic policy, negotia- tions, trade, and commerce;  Organization:  A. The establishment of dedicated and  trained personnel in the country’s foreign  office or equivalent organization whose  primary mission includes active engage- ment internationally in cyber security  diplomacy;  B. A demonstrated consistency between  the numbers and ranks of dedicated for- eign cyber diplomatic personnel and the  announced commitment of a country to  engage in cyber security diplomacy as a  top tier issue of national importance;  Resources:  A. The identification of the financial and hu- man resources requested and allocated  for cyber diplomatic engagement;  Implementation:  A. Demonstrated participation in defining,  signing, and enforcing international,  multi-national, regional and/or bilateral  agreements pursuing mutually acceptable  solutions to common challenges; and  B. Demonstrated evidence of efforts to  influence international trade and com- merce negotiations that pertain to the  use of ICT or the internationally, region- ally, and/or nationally shared aspects of  cyber infrastructure, critical services, and  technologies.  Initial findings in this essential element are  based upon a review of whether a country has  explicitly designated or established a govern- mental office or charged individuals with dip- lomatic responsibilities that include both the  economic and security aspects of cyber issues.  The CRI 2.0 draws upon primary and second- ary sources to determine whether and to what  degree governmental office(s) or individuals  participate in and influence international nego- tiations on issues pertaining to cyber security.  Updates to this essential element will monitor,  track, and evaluate substantive and notable  developments.  7. DEFENSE AND CRISIS RESPONSE  The seventh and final element of cyber readi- ness is the ability of a country’s national armed  forces and/or related defense agency to de-  ©  2015 Cyber Readiness Index 2.0, all rights reserved.  28  fend the country from threats emanating from  cyberspace. Countries interested in this type of  capability are directing their defense forces to  establish capacity or expertise to respond to  cyber threats that rise to the level of nationally  critical “cybered” conflicts.90  Countries are becoming more connected and  Internet-dependent that in turn is making them  more vulnerable to disruptive and destructive  cyber activities. Most countries’ defensive pos- tures are weak in the face of sophisticated cy- ber attacks. The globally connected nature of  modern competitions and conflicts encourage  cyber-enabled adversaries to move laterally  across national systems and target a country’s  commercial and non-state organizations. For  example, in August 2012, Saudi Aramco suf- fered a targeted attack that used malicious  software to destroy data and damage nearly  seventy five percent of the company’s IT infra- structure.91 Corporate officials claimed that the  disrupted the control systems at a German  Steel Mill, causing its blast furnace to shut  down improperly, which resulted in significant  damages.93 The same year, Sony pictures fell  victim to a cyber attack where unreleased mo- tion pictures were illegally copied, corporate  emails were stolen and then leaked, and finan- cial documents were exposed. Sensitive data  on tens of thousands of Sony employees were  copied, and nearly 80 percent of the compa- ny’s IT assets were destroyed, from data to  hardware, by virulent malware.94  Countries must be prepared to defend their  connected and networked interests for current  and future conflicts. The speed and reach of  the Internet helps connect all aspects of soci- ety and provides easy access to military-grade  cyber weapons, giving an asymmetric advan- tage to many. Indeed, the diversity of malicious  actors including political activists, criminals,  terrorists, state and non-state actors—all with  Disruptive and destructive cyber activities  requires a credible cyber defense.  incident was intended to affect oil production.  A few months later, in March 2013, multiple  financial institutions in South Korea, including  Shinhan Bank—the country’s fourth largest  bank—suffered damages from malware simi- lar to those used against Saudi Aramco. The  bank’s e-services were disrupted and data was  destroyed. The economic damages from this  incident were estimated to have reached ap- proximately $800 billion dollars.92 In December  2014, hackers successfully manipulated and  differing motives underscores the need to pre- pare for worst-case scenarios. At present, more  than sixty countries have developed capabili- ties for cyber espionage and attack, while also  demonstrating considerable interest in acquir- ing or developing defensive and pre-emptive  offensive capabilities.95 Additionally, countries  have started to devise different strategies and  tools to upgrade their national level cyber de- fenses. Most governments have instinctively  looked to increase the existing defensive ca-  29  ©  2015 Cyber Readiness Index 2.0, all rights reserved.  pabilities of their security agencies that already  are capable of operating in, through, and as  enabled by cyberspace outside their national  borders (i.e. the defense organization or intel- ligence services). Others have sought to place  these capabilities in security organizations not  directly located within their military structure.96  For instance, in 2010 the United States estab- lished a dedicated military unit—the United  States Cyber Command—to defend against  cyber threats to military infrastructure. Its mis- sion was expanded in 2015 when the Depart- ment of Defense’s (DoD) published its second  Cyber Strategy to guide the development of  DoD cyber forces (under the command and  control of United States Cyber Command) and  to strengthen its cyber defenses and cyber de- terrence posture. This new strategy highlights  the need to be “prepared to defend the United  States homeland and United States vital inter- ests from disruptive or destructive cyber attacks  of significant consequence,” and to build,  maintain, and use viable cyber options to con- trol conflict escalation and shape the combat  environment at all stages.97  Similarly, in December 2014, the Russian  Federation released its new Military Doctrine  that highlights Russia’s development of cyber  warfare capabilities for both offensive and  defensive purposes as well as “non-nuclear  deterrence.”98 Russia’s 2011 Ministry of De- fense White Paper, “Conceptual Views on the  Activities of the Armed Forces of the Russian  Federation in Information Space,” parallels  aspects of the Russian Defense Doctrine, but  also explicitly includes public opinion and the  need to keep the media abreast of evolving  conflict situations for de-escalation purpos- es.99 According to the Russian media, Russia’s  leadership plans to release a new Information  Security Doctrine in 2016, which allegedly will  propose to develop forces for information  warfare and information systems for strategic  deterrence and the prevention of conflicts.100  The Republic of South Korea (ROK) and Brazil  have also established similar military organiza- tions aimed at securing offensive, defensive,  and response capabilities as well as ensuring  complete victory in cyber warfare.101 South Ko- rea has been expanding its cyber capabilities  and is reportedly training over four hundred  new cyber troops for its ROK Defense Cyber  Command, bringing the total to around one  thousand.102  Additionally, while the People’s Republic of  China (PRC) has not publicly issued any for- mal strategic doctrine for cyber or information  military applications, it has published Military  Strategic Guidelines that provides direction for  defense policy.103 The PRC’s 2013 White Paper:  the Diversified Employment of China’s Armed  Forces and the 2014 “Opinion on Further  Strengthening Information Security Work,”  stress the development of defensive cyber ca- pabilities. The documents emphasize that the  People’s Liberation Army (PLA) will not attack  unless attacked, but if attacked, will counterat- tack in cyberspace.104  A cyber defense agency need not be a uni- formed agency within the nation’s military.  National police and intelligence forces can  be the loci of a government’s central capacity  to defend in cyberspace, although the armed  forces will also need to be modernized and  cyber ready for more traditional conflicts. For  example, Iceland has concentrated its cyber  responses outside its armed forces. In the past,  Icelandic cyber security responsibilities were  informally divided among the Ministry of the  ©  2015 Cyber Readiness Index 2.0, all rights reserved.  30  Interior, the Post and Telecom Administration,  the Data Protection Authority, and the Icelan- dic Police. However, in 2015 Iceland central- ized all of its cyber capabilities under the Na- tional Commissioner of the Icelandic Police.105  Iceland’s June 2015 national cyber strategy  also highlights the integral role of the NATO  alliance to Iceland’s cyber defense.106  Finally, while Israel does not presently have a  formalized “cyber command,” its cyber securi- ty capabilities exist and are dispersed through- out the Israeli Defense Force (IDF) and the  Military Intelligence Directorate. The Military  Intelligence Directorate handles offensive ca- pabilities, while the services deal with protec- tion. Shin Bet, Israel’s internal security service,  is responsible for defending government sys- tems and critical national infrastructure, and the  National Cybernetic Taskforce secures critical  networks and private industry against hacking  and espionage.107 This may change, however,  because in June 2015, Lt. Gen. Gadi Eisenkot,  commander of the Israeli Army, declared his in- tent to establish a new IDF corps—on par with  the Navy and Air Force—responsible for all  cyber activity. Should the defense minister ap- prove the new corps, the new cyber IDF would  be operational within two years. Once opera- tional, the new Cyber Command will integrate  defensive capabilities currently provided by  the IDF with offensive and intelligence capac- ity performed by Unit 8200 and other military  intelligence communities.108 This aligns with  the new IDF five-year plan, “Gideon,” which  was published in August 2015. “Gideon” spe- cifically calls for increased initiatives to fend off  cyber attacks and other asymmetric threats,  which may emanate from non-state and terror- ist groups in the region.109  A cyber defense capability is necessary for a  country to ensure its national and economic  security. As countries become more reliant on  the Internet and ICT systems, the more vul- nerable they will become to “low level” cyber  threats and asymmetric activity. Countries are  faced with a Catch-22, greater ICT uptake is  essential for growth, but the more connected  a country becomes the more risks they incur.  Opting out of the Internet economy is no lon- ger an option. Countries must be prepared to  defend themselves in cyberspace. If a country  is unable to defend itself, it is not cyber ready.  Elements of a country’s commitment to de- velop and deploy dedicated national defense  units with cyber defense capabilities/responsi- bilities may include:  Statement:  A. The publication of national statements  that assign an organization the nation- al cyber defense mission as a top tier  mission;  B. The establishment of policies for the cy- ber defense organization to respond to  cyber threats;  C. The articulation of national statements  that direct the cyber defense organization  to develop capacity to respond to threats  within or outside the sovereign territory;  Organization:  A. The establishment of a national-level  organization, within the military, whose  primary mission is the cyber defense of  the nation;  B. The establishment of a national-level or- ganization, not within the military, whose  primary mission is the cyber defense of  the nation;  31  ©  2015 Cyber Readiness Index 2.0, all rights reserved.  Resources:  A. The identification of financial and human  resources requested and allocated for the  organization, within the military, whose  mission explicitly includes the cyber de- fense of the nation;  B. The identification of the financial and hu- man resources requested and allocated  for the organization, not within the mili- tary, whose mission explicitly includes the  cyber defense of the nation;  Implementation:  A. Evidence of conducted government-level  exercises that demonstrate national cyber  defense readiness;  B. Evidence of conducted national-level  exercises involving affected commercial  entities that demonstrate national cyber  defense readiness;  C. Evidence of conducted exercises with  international partners (e.g. NATO mutual  defense or APCERT Drill) that demon- strate cooperation through information  exchange and assistance;  D. The establishment of standards for re- sponsible state behavior in cyberspace  and identification of thresholds that per- mit engagement for cyber defense; and  E. The establishment of rapid assistance  mechanisms (separable from CERTs or  equivalents) for the government or spe- cific industries in case of major cyber  incidents.  Initial findings in this essential element are  based upon a review of whether a country has  officially declared to establish defense forces  whose top-level mission includes cyber de- fense of the nation. The CRI 2.0 draws on pri- mary and secondary sources to determine the  level of operational maturity. Updates to this  essential element will monitor, track, and eval- uate substantive and notable developments.  CONCLUSION  No country is cyber ready.  The threats to our networked systems and  infrastructures are real and growing and im- pose costs in economic terms to countries and  society. Economic and national security agen- das must align to bring transparency to cyber  insecurity. Showing this vital association may  spark national and global interest in address- ing this economic erosion. The CRI 2.0’s com- prehensive, comparative, experience-based  methodology provides a blueprint to evaluate  any country’s maturity and commitment to se- curing their national cyber infrastructure and  services upon which their digital future and  growth depend.  The CRI 2.0 blueprint identifies over seventy  unique data indicators across seven essential  elements: national strategy, incident response,  e-crime and law enforcement, information  sharing, investment in R&D, diplomacy and  trade, and defense and crisis response. These  indicators and essential elements provide a  framework for a country to develop a stronger  erosion.The  ©  2015 Cyber Readiness Index 2.0, all rights reserved.  32  security posture that can defend against GDP  erosion. In effect, the CRI 2.0 challenges the  conventional wisdom that cyber security is pre- dominately a national security issue. The CRI  2.0 can demonstrate how national security is  closely intertwined with Internet connectivity  and rapid adoption of ICT which, when secure,  can lead to economic growth and prosperity.  Instead of simply studying the problem, the  CRI 2.0 offers a framework for a country to  evaluate the strength of its ability to prevent  economic erosion from cyber insecurity. The  CRI 2.0 will be updated periodically adding  evaluation criteria without losing comparative  validity with any prior assessments. In that way,  the CRI 2.0 will demonstrate countries’ prog- ress and evolution toward securing the cyber  infrastructure and services upon which their  digital future and growth depend.  No country can afford cyber insecurity and the  losses it incurs. The CRI 2.0 data and method- ology can help national leaders chart a path to  a safer, more resilient economy in a deeply cy- bered, competitive, and conflict-prone world.

The Cyber Readiness Index 2.0 builds  on the previous Cyber Readiness Index  1.0, which provided a methodological  framework for assessing cyber read- iness across five essential elements,  namely: cyber national strategy, incident  response, e-crime and legal capacity,  information sharing, and cyber research  and development. The Cyber Readiness  Index 1.0 applied this methodology to  an initial set of thirty-five countries.

The latter is fully technolog- ical and could, in principle, be conducted  entirely within a network. It is normally  a component of the former. “Cybered  conflicts are those nationally significant  aggressive and disruptive conflicts for  which seminal events determining the  outcome could not have occurred with- out ‘cyber’ (meaning networked technol- ogies) mechanisms at critical junctures in  the determining course of events.” Chris  Demchak, “Resilience, Disruption, and a  ‘Cyber Westphalia’: Options for National  Security in a Cybered Conflict World,”  in Securing Cyberspace: A New Domain  for National Security, edited by Nicholas  Burns and Jonathon Price, (Washing- ton, DC: The Aspen Institute, 2012).  91.

CYBER READINESS INDEX 2.0  A PLAN FOR CYBER READINESS: A BASELINE AND AN INDEX  Principal Investigator: Melissa Hathaway Chris Demchak, Jason Kerben, Jennifer McArdle, Francesca Spidalieri  The Cyber Readiness Index 2.0 is expanded from the Cyber Readiness Index 1.0, published November 2013.  INTRODUCTION  Global leaders understand that increased Inter- net connectivity leads to economic growth only  if the underlying infrastructure and the devices  connected to it are safe and secure. Therefore,  countries must align their national economic  visions with their national security priorities.  Until now, however, there has not been a com- prehensive, comparative, experiential meth- odology to evaluate a country’s maturity and  commitment to securing its national cyber in- frastructure and services upon which its digital  future and growth depend. The Cyber Readi- ness Index (CRI) 1.01 represented a new way  of examining the problem and was designed  to spark international discussion and inspire  global action to address the economic erosion  caused by cyber insecurity.  Today, no country is cyber ready.  It is a given that global economic growth is  increasingly dependent upon the rapid adop- tion of information communication technology  (ICT) and connecting society to the Internet.  Indeed, each country’s digital agenda promis- es to stimulate economic growth, increase ef- ficiency, improve service delivery and capacity,  drive innovation and productivity gains, and  promote good governance. Yet, the availabil- ity, integrity, and resilience of this core infra- structure are in harm’s way. The volume, scope,  velocity, and sophistication of threats to our  networked systems and infrastructures are real  and growing. Data breaches, criminal activity,  service disruptions, and property destruction  are becoming commonplace and threaten the  Internet economy.  ©  2015 Cyber Readiness Index 2.0, all rights reserved.  2  Building on CRI 1.0, Cyber Readiness Index 2.0  examines one hundred twenty-five countries  that have embraced, or are starting to em- brace, ICT and the Internet and then applies  an objective methodology to evaluate each  country’s maturity and commitment to cyber  security across seven essential elements. By  applying this methodology, a country can bet- ter understand its Internet-Infrastructure entan- glements and the resulting dependencies and  vulnerabilities.2 Specifically, the CRI 2.0 assess- es countries’ levels of preparedness for certain  cyber risks and  identifies areas where national  leaders can alter or refine their country’s current  posture by leveraging or changing laws, poli- cies, standards, market levers (e.g., incentives  and regulations), and implementing other ini- tiatives to preserve the security of their connec- tivity and protect the value of their economy.  BACKGROUND Most countries have embraced ICT-enabled  economic strategies  and are working to pro- vide fast, reliable, and affordable communica- tions to every household and business to move  their information society into the digital age.3  Modernization initiatives like e-government,  e-banking, e-health, e-learning, next gener- ation power grids, and automating elements  of the transportation infrastructure and other  essential services, are at the top of most coun- tries’ economic agenda. For example, China’s  Internet Plus strategy seeks to actively encour- age the healthy development of e-commerce,  industrial networks, and Internet banking, as  well as facilitate the growth of new industries  and the expansion of its companies’ inter- national Internet footprint.4 Like many other  countries, China views the Internet as key to  its future growth and development opportuni-  ties. Similarly, India’s Prime Minister Modi laid  out his vision to transform his country into a  “digitally empowered knowledge economy;”  leveraging India’s globally acclaimed informa- tion technology (IT) competence to create jobs  in IT, telecommunications, and in electronic  device markets. In addition, India is seeking  to become an innovator in ICT solutions for  health, knowledge management, and financial  markets.5 Finally, the European Commission is  working to create a meaningful single market  for digital services that can enable the free  movement of goods, services, capital, and  businesses. Successful implementation of this  “Digital Single Market Strategy” is estimated  to lead to an additional €415 billion per year in  GDP growth across Europe.6  Countries must align their  national economic visions with  their national security priorities.  Governments, in developing countries in par- ticular, are pushing for even more aggressive  ICT adoption strategies to provide additional  services to millions of citizens in order to more  rapidly boost and deepen economic advanc- es.7 In fact, the World Bank estimates that for  every 10 percent of the population connected  to the Internet, GDP grows by 1 to 2 percent.8  Moreover, recent research suggests a growing  recognition among governments and busi- nesses that embracing the Internet and ICTs  will enhance their long-term competitiveness  3  ©  2015 Cyber Readiness Index 2.0, all rights reserved.  and societal well-being, potentially contribut- ing up to 8 percent of a nation’s GDP.9  Some  reports go even further to suggest that the  modernization of industrial systems (e.g., elec- tric power grids, oil and gas pipelines, manu- facturing, etc.) represents a 46 percent share of  the global economy, and could rise to as much  as 50 percent in the next ten years.10  Nations cannot afford to ignore this economic  opportunity. But few are considering the  impact and economic costs of less resilient  critical services, exposure/violation of citizen  privacy, theft of corporate proprietary data and  state secrets, and the impact of e-fraud and  e-crime—all of which lead to economic and  national security instability. Put simply, cyber  insecurity is a tax on growth.11  For example, it is estimated that the Group of  Twenty (G20) economies have lost 2.5 million  jobs to counterfeiting and piracy, and that  governments and consumers lose up to $125  billion to cyber crime annually, including losses  in tax revenue.12 The United States estimates  the annual impact of international intellectual  property (IP) theft to the American economy  at $300 billion. This corresponds to 1 percent  of its GDP.13 Other studies conducted by the  Netherlands, United Kingdom, and Germany  estimate similar losses in GDP. No nation can  afford to lose even 1 percent of its GDP to illicit  cyber activities. As countries continue to em- brace ICT and Internet connectivity, however,  the exposure, attendant risks, and economic  costs will exponentially increase if security and  resilience are not at the core of their modern- ization strategies.  Measuring such losses to the economy will  force national leaders to better align their  country’s national security agenda with their  economic agenda and invest in the derivative  value of both.14 Bringing transparency to the  economic losses caused by cyber insecurity  may spark national and global interest in ad- dressing this economic erosion.  The CRI 2.0  establishes a framework to guide countries in  securely pursuing the economic growth of a re- silient, ICT-enhanced, and connected society.  CYBER READINESS INDEX  2.0 — THE METHODOLOGY The CRI 2.0 has two main components: first, it is  designed to inform national leaders on the steps  they should consider to protect their increas- ingly connected countries and potential GDP  growth by objectively evaluating each country’s  maturity and commitment to cyber security and  resilience. Secondly, the CRI defines what it  means for a country to be “cyber ready” and  documents the core components of cyber read- iness into an actionable blueprint for countries  to follow. The CRI 2.0 methodology represents  a useful, unique, and user-friendly tool to as- sess the gap between a nation’s current cyber  security posture and the national cyber capa-  Resilient connected societies  must drive modernization  with security at its core.  Cyber insecurity is a  tax on growth.  ©  2015 Cyber Readiness Index 2.0, all rights reserved.  4  bilities needed to achieve its economic vision.  The blueprint developed and employed for this  analysis includes over seventy unique data indi- cators across the following seven elements:  1. National strategy;  2. Incident response;  3. E-crime and law enforcement;  4. Information sharing;  5. Investment in research and  development (R&D);  6. Diplomacy and trade; and  7. Defense and crisis response.  The fact-based assessments for each coun- try rely on primary sources, and each unique  data point is grounded on empirical research  and documentation. Countries are assessed  for each indicator across three levels of cyber  readiness: insufficient evidence, partially oper- ational or fully operational.  The CRI 2.0 methodology is being applied to  evaluate one hundred twenty-five countries’  cyber readiness; assessing each country’s ma- turity and commitment to cyber security and  resilient infrastructures and services (Figure 1  and Table 1).  The country selection includes the top  seventy-five countries from the International  Telecommunication Union (ITU) ICT Develop- ment Index (IDI) to emphasize the importance  of connectedness. Members of the G20 econ- omies were added because they represent 90  percent of global GDP, 80 percent of interna- tional trade, 64 percent of the world’s popula- tion, and 84 percent of all fossil fuel emissions.  In order to be regionally representative and  globally inclusive, additional countries were  selected from: the Organization for Economic  Cooperation and Development (OECD), the  African Economic Community (AEC), the Latin  American Integration Association (LAIA), the  Insufficient Evidence: evidence is lacking or has yet to be  located. It is possible, however, that the data exists but is not  yet publicly available or is classified.  Partially Operational: there is evidence of policies, activi- ties, and/or funding, however, the activity may be immature,  incomplete, or still in the early stages of development. While  these initiatives can be observed, it may be difficult to mea- sure their functionality.  Fully Operational: there is sufficient evidence to observe and  measure a mature, functioning activity.15  5  ©  2015 Cyber Readiness Index 2.0, all rights reserved.

Countries from  these regional economic groupings are repre- sented in the IDI, and are often also included in  the World Economic Forum’s (WEF)  Network  Readiness Index. This ensures that every se- lected country is embracing ICT and investing  in accessible and affordable Internet services  to promote economic growth.  Given that the GCC is not representative of the  Middle East, three states that have the highest  GDP rankings outside the GCC were also add- ed: Iran, Yemen, and Lebanon.16  This cross-section of one hundred twenty-five  countries represents a significant portion of the  world and is demonstrative of the diverse and  representative nature of the CRI 2.0’s country  selection criteria.  The CRI 2.0’s focus on the interconnection be- tween economics and security (or lack thereof) provides a solid foundation for each country to  assess its cyber security maturity, and serves  as a framework for informing policy and strat- egy, operational and institutional initiatives,  resourcing requirements, regulatory and leg- islative formulation, and diverse market lever  implementation. Implementing CRI 2.0 will  raise awareness about the linkage between a  sustainable cyberspace and GDP growth for  every country, given that the future of a coun- try’s GDP is likely to be increasingly technology  dominated and Internet-related. Moreover, it  creates the basis for understanding the eco-  nomic erosion caused by cyber insecurity and  the degree to which national security concerns  are considered a component of a country’s dig- ital and economic agenda. This methodology  can lead to analytically based decisions on how  to respond to and get ahead of the problem.  Finally, the CRI 2.0 provides international enti- ties, such as the ITU, the WEF, the Organization  of American States (OAS), the Inter-American  Development Bank (IDB), the World Bank, and  others, with a framework and complimentary  approach to their respective initiatives and in- ternational discussions.  A detailed description of the seven essential  elements of the CRI 2.0 methodology follows.  Each section contains an essential element with  at least ten supporting indicators for evalua- tion that when combined represent a blueprint  of a country’s cyber readiness. Furthermore,  country examples are provided that illustrate  innovative and multicultural solutions towards  becoming cyber ready. While these examples  are by no means comprehensive, they do high- light unique country-level approaches.  1. NATIONAL STRATEGY  The first—and most important—area that indi- cates a country’s cyber readiness is the articula- tion and publication of a National Cyber Secu- rity Strategy that aligns the country’s economic  vision with its national security imperatives.  The Internet, broadband networks, mobile ap- plications, IT services, software, and hardware  constitute the foundations of the digital econo- my and a country’s digital future.17 The Internet  and ICTs have become the backbone of family  platforms (e.g., Facebook™, Twitter™, Insta-  7  ©  2015 Cyber Readiness Index 2.0, all rights reserved.  gram™, Renren™, VKontakte™, etc.), business  engines, critical services and infrastructures,  and the global economy.18 The inter-depen- dencies and hyper-connectivity touch each  sector. For example, advanced manufacturing  uses industrial control systems and robotics to  increase productivity and decrease the need  for manual intervention. Modern agriculture  embeds Internet Protocol (IP) devices on  crops to determine fertilizer requirements and  to adjust water supplies.  IP devices are also  placed on livestock to determine where the  animals graze and consume water, assessing  the animals’ health on a near-constant basis.  E-commerce, the free flow of goods and ser- vices across borders, is displacing the role of  traditional storefronts, delivering a wide vari- ety of items directly to the doorstep of on-line  shoppers shortly after they place an on-line  order. Transportation systems now use sensors,  mobile devices, and unmanned kiosks to man- age traffic and deliver tickets. Connected cities  use geo-location devices to track the speed  and location of automobiles to determine if a  driver has obeyed the laws of the road. Mod- ernization initiatives in the healthcare indus- try are digitizing citizens’ health records and  employing cloud-based computing to enable  swift access to healthcare records anywhere  in the world. Telemedicine uses high-speed  Internet to deliver medical advice and services  to underserved areas. Finally, financial systems  exchange trillions of dollars daily, commodities  markets trade using digital currency, and In- ternet banking is replacing the need for local,  physical banks.  The threats to networked infrastructures are  on the rise. Countries are beginning to under- stand these threats and are outlining the need  for infrastructure protection, data protection,  defense of the homeland, and other descrip- tors. A comprehensive national cyber security  strategy needs to describe the threats to the  country in economic terms, and outline the  necessary steps, programs, and initiatives that  must be undertaken to address those threats  and protect the Internet connectivity and the  ICT utilized by citizens and private and public  organizations.19 The strategy should be under- pinned by the economic potential of the Inter- net and ICT adoption and include the initiatives  that will help reduce GDP erosion caused by  cyber threats, as well as increase the security  and resilience of the country as a whole.  National cyber security strategies  must reflect the economic  importance of cyber security.  A sound National Cyber Security Strategy  must not be just articulated. It must be ac- tionable. Today, the primary topics reflected  in most strategies include: outlining organi- zational and positional authority within the  government; fostering awareness and edu- cation among citizens; building an incident  and crisis management response capability;  expanding law enforcement’s capacity to  deal with the rate of cyber crimes; facilitating  private-public partnerships and developing  trusted information sharing exchanges; and  marshaling resources toward a R&D and  innovation agenda. Many strategies begin  ©  2015 Cyber Readiness Index 2.0, all rights reserved.  8  with statistics, quantifying incident volume and  the rate of infrastructure infection, and naming  the variety of threats. The data is used to jus- tify organizational responsibility and increased  funding for missions and organizations. Rarely  do these strategies prioritize the services and  infrastructures that are most at risk, nor do  they align the security measures and resource  requirements necessary to reduce exposure  and economic losses. A sound National Cyber  Security Strategy should state the strategic  problem or problems in economic terms; iden- tify and empower the competent authority20  that is accountable for the strategy’s execu- tion; include specific, measurable, attainable,  result-based, and time-based objectives in an  implementation plan; and recognize the need  to commit limited resources (e.g., political will,  money, time, and people) in a competitive  environment to achieve the necessary security  and economic outcomes.  At least sixty-seven countries (with others in de- velopment) have already published their cyber  security strategy, outlining key steps that are  intended to increase their national security and  resilience.21 Many others have national strate- gies (not specific to cyber security) that guide  and coordinate their efforts to advance their  cyber security posture. Few countries, however,  are explicitly linking their economic and nation- al security agendas and specifically addressing  the economic importance of cyber security.  Fewer still are building actionable strategies.  Therefore, all countries have an opportunity to  revise or develop their strategies to reflect the  economic importance of cyber security.  Elements of a comprehensive national cyber  security strategy should include:  Statement:  A. The publication of a national cyber secu- rity strategy that is inclusive of economic  opportunities and risks associated with  ICT uptake;  Organization:  A. The designation of a competent authority  and the clear delineation of its positional  authority;  B. The identification of the key government  entities affected by, and/or responsible  for, the implementation of the national  cyber security strategy;  C. The identification of commercial-sector  entities affected by, and/or, responsible  for the implementation of the national  cyber security strategy (recognizing com- mercial-sector dependencies);  Resources:  A. The identification of the financial and hu- man resources requested and allocated  for the implementation of the strategy;  B. The identification of the percentage of  GDP expected to be gained or lost (gross- ly) by implementing the strategy;  Implementation:  A. The identification of the mechanisms re- quired to secure critical cyber infrastruc- ture and ICT uptake;  9  ©  2015 Cyber Readiness Index 2.0, all rights reserved.  B. The identification of critical services (not  critical infrastructures) that the strategy in- tends to make more secure and resilient;  and  C. The identification of national standards  for continuity of service agreements (24  hours/7 days a week) and outage report- ing requirements for each critical service,  industry, and infrastructure.  The findings in this essential element, as with  the other six areas, represent a snapshot in  time of a dynamic and changing landscape.  As countries continue to develop their national  cyber security strategies, updates to this es- sential element will reflect those changes and  monitor, track, and evaluate substantive and  notable developments. Thus, the CRI 2.0 will  continue to provide a blueprint with new ex- amples to inform others in the formulation or  revision of their strategies.  2. INCIDENT RESPONSE  The second essential element that indicates a  country’s cyber readiness involves establishing  and maintaining an effective national incident  response capability. Often, this capability takes  the form of one or more National Computer  Security Incident Response Teams (National  CSIRTs) or Computer Emergency Response  Teams (CERTs)—hereinafter referred to collec- tively as CSIRTs—responsible for managing in- cident response in the event of natural or man- made cyber-related disasters that affect critical  services and information infrastructures.22 At  present, one hundred and two  national CSIRTs  have been established worldwide and another  four CSIRTs are under development.23 CSIRT  teams usually consist of a blend of IT security  experts and practitioners from academia, the  private sector, and government. In addition to  providing the specific technical competence to  respond to cyber incidents of national interest,  these incident response teams strengthen the  ability of a national government to understand  and combat cyber threats. Operating a Nation- al CSIRT, therefore, forms a core component of  a country’s overall strategy to secure and main- tain the services and infrastructures that are vi- tal to national security and economic growth.24  National CSIRTs, unlike strictly governmental  ones, serve a broad constituency ranging from  government departments to private and public  entities to citizens. A well-established Nation- al CSIRT provides reactive services above all  else—i.e., the ability to respond to incidents  by containing and mitigating incidents as they  occur.25 Although the specific organizational  form of National CSIRTs may vary, and not  every country may have the same needs and  resources, these specialized and dedicated  units should provide a series of both proactive  and reactive functions, as well as preventive,  educational, and security quality management  services. These services include, but are not  limited to: establishing shared understanding  of the threats facing the country; publishing  alerts and advisories on cyber vulnerabilities  and threats; promoting cyber security aware- ness and best practices; identifying, detecting,  containing, and managing security threats and  preparing for potential incidents; coordinating  incident response activities; analyzing comput- er security incidents and providing feedback  and lessons learned (for shared learning); pro- moting activities that increase resilience; and  supporting the national cyber security strategy.  ©  2015 Cyber Readiness Index 2.0, all rights reserved.  10  For example, Singapore’s national CSIRT  (SingCERT) was developed by the Infocomm  Development Authority of Singapore (IDA) in  cooperation with the National University of  Singapore (NUS) in 1997. It has since become  a part of the Cyber Security Agency of Singa- pore (CSA). SingCERT was designed as a one- stop center for incident response; facilitating  the detection, resolution, and prevention of  security related incidents on the Internet. Sing- CERT provides technical assistance and coor- dinates response to cyber security incidents,  identifies and follows cyber intrusion trends,  disseminates timely threat information, and  coordinates with other security agencies to re-  sible for incident response, awareness raising,  data collection on cyber threats and intrusions,  and coordination with multiple stakeholders to  include CSIRTs, academia, and the private sec- tor. In addition, Brazil’s CSIRTs include teams  from the financial sector, military, government,  and universities.28  Apart from national CSIRTs, similar regional  entities have been established to enhance and  coordinate incident response activities within  specific geographic regions. AfricaCERT, for  instance, is a non-profit organization that in- cludes eleven African countries and provides  a forum for cooperation and the exchange of  Resilience of critical services is vital to national  security and economic growth.  solve computer security incidents.26 SingCERT  has also been active in organizing and hosting  Association of South East Asian Nations (ASE- AN) and Asia Pacific Computer Emergency Re- sponse Team (APCERT) exercises. Additionally,  Singapore hosts seven Forum of Incident Re- sponse and Security Teams (FIRST) members.  Brazil’s incident response capabilities consist  of a national computer emergency response  team, CERT.BR, and thirty regional CSIRTs split  across four states, all under the authority of  the Brazilian Internet Steering Committee. This  Committee is a non-governmental, multi-stake- holder organization and the primary entity  responsible for network defense and incident  response in Brazil.27 Brazil’s CERT.BR is respon-  technical information between operators of  Internet-connected networks in the region. Af- ricaCERTs main objectives include, but are not  limited to: coordinating cooperation among  African CSIRTS to handle computer security  incidents; assisting in the establishment of  CSIRTs in countries that currently lack incident  response capabilities; fostering and support- ing incident prevention and educational out- reach programs in ICT security; encouraging  information sharing; and promoting best prac- tices for cyber security. Similarly, the APCERT  comprises a network of twenty-eight member  CERTs and other trusted security experts in  the region, and it aims to enhance awareness  and competency in relation to computer secu- rity incidents and improve incident response  11  ©  2015 Cyber Readiness Index 2.0, all rights reserved.  capabilities across the Asia Pacific region.29  APCERT’s mission is the pursuit of a “clean,  safe, and reliable” cyberspace through global  collaboration. In order to effectively commu- nicate cyber threats, APCERT’s organizational  framework relies on a point-of-contact (POC)  system, in which each country delegates an  APCERT member to serve as a POC during  times of emergency, in order to help facilitate  timely response.30 Likewise, the Organisation  of Islamic Cooperation Computer Emergency  Response Team (OIC-CERT)—which includes  member states in Southeast Asia, South Asia,  the Middle East, Africa, and Central Asia— also works to enhance collaboration between  member state CERTs and OIC-CERT.  In addition to developing incident response  capabilities, countries are also participating in  cyber incident response exercises. These exer- cises help countries practice and develop skills  for effective crisis management and verify the  operational ability of a CSIRT to respond under  pressure. For example, in November 2011, the  German Executive Branch conducted a one- day crisis planning/readiness exercise. The  goal of the exercise was to work out govern- ment response procedures for a multi-pronged  attack that included: distributed denial of ser- vice (DDoS) attacks against critical infrastruc- tures; the injection of malware into the banking  system, causing a crisis with ATMs and credit  cards; and the insertion of false traffic within  the air traffic control system.31 The Swedish Civ- il Contingencies Agency (MSB), the Post and  Telecom Authority (PTS), and the National De- fence Radio Establishment (FRA) also host reg- ular cooperative Chief Information Assurance  Officer (CIAO) courses for relevant employees  working at the senior management levels. The  course culminates in a capstone exercise—a  cyber crisis management simulation—that in- cludes key public and private stakeholders in  the decision making process, to include Parlia- ment and Chief Executive Officers (CEOs) from  companies responsible for Swedish critical  services. The exercise highlights crucial policy  and legal shortfalls, while at the same time  educating all participants on cyber security.32  Additionally, the Czech Republic conducted  an incident response exercise in October 2015  that focused on threats to critical infrastructure,  with a specific emphasis on nuclear power  plants.33  Some countries are also conducting  exercises in reaction to cyber incidents that  have occcured. For example, South Korea’s  President Park Guen-hye ordered cyber war  drills and training for all staff, as a result of  malware found in multiple Korea Hydro and  Nuclear Power (KHNP) plants.34  Furthermore, international exercises test op- erational incident response capabilities while  simulating cooperation between countries. The  United States, for example, conducts a biannu- al Cyber Storm exercise that seeks to strength- en cyber preparedness in the public and pri- vate sectors. Each Cyber Storm exercise builds  on lessons learned from previous real-world  incidents, to ensure that participants have an  opportunity to practice incident response to  ever-more sophisticated cyber incidents. The  2016 Cyber Storm will include sixteen states,  eleven countries, and fourteen federal agen- cies.35 The European Union also holds bian- nual cyber incident response exercises among  member states and the private sector, entitled  Cyber Europe.36 During a 24 hour cyber exer- cise in 2014, Cyber Europe allowed nearly all  European Union member states to test their  response capabilities against as many as two  thousand real-life cyber attacks, to include  DDoS, web defacement attacks, data exfiltra- tion, and cyber attacks against critical infra- structure.37 Moreover, the European Defense  Agency (EDA) and the North America Treaty  ©  2015 Cyber Readiness Index 2.0, all rights reserved.  12  Organization (NATO) also conduct region wide  complex cyber crisis management exercises,  with the goal of strengthening cyber incident  response capacity among member states and  understanding cross-border dependencies.38  The United States and the United Kingdom  also recently announced that they will test how  financial centers on either side of the Atlantic  would respond to a massive cyber attack. The  exercise ran in November 2015 and tested  country response and cross-Atlantic coordina- tion and communication.39  National CSIRTs can also be used as a mech- anism to build confidence between countries  and foster cooperation. For example, China,  Japan, and Korea—three countries that have  historically experienced tensions—have devel- oped a trilateral annual CSIRT meeting to dis- cuss cyber incident response mechanisms. The  meetings have helped instill confidence and  trust resulting in the development of a cyber  “hotline” to communicate on significant cyber  incidents.40  Cyber incident response capabilties, joint  meetings, and exercises are just a few of the  basic mechanisms that can help a country pro- actively prepare for and mitigate the ripple ef- fects of a major cyber incident. CSIRTs increase  a country’s speed, recovery, and resilience  against cyber threats, reducing the likely over- all economic and operational impact of na- tionally significant attacks or campaigns. Some  of the key preconditions for the successful  deployment of these incident response teams  are a well trained staff, and effective rapidly  deployable tools. This facilitates an incident  response team’s ability to foster cooperation  and coordination in incident prevention, en- able rapid reaction to incidents, and promote  information sharing among stakeholders, both  domestically and internationally.  Elements of a sound national incident response  capability should include:  Statement:  A. The publication of an incident response  plan for emergencies and crises;  B. The identification and mapping of  cross-sector dependencies that address  continuity of operations and disaster re- covery mechanisms;  C. Evidence that the plan is exercised and  updated regularly;  D. The publication and dissemination of a  national cyber threat assessment(s) on  government, critical infrastructures, and  essential services networks;  Organization:  A. The establishment of a national CSIRT  to manage incident response and serve  a broad national constituency (beyond  government and critical infrastructure  providers);  B. The identification of a network of author- itative national contact points for govern- mental and regulatory bodies;  C. The identification of a network of author- itative national contact points for critical  industries that are essential for the oper- ation and recovery of critical services and  infrastructures;  D. The development of an information warn- ing and alert system that can be used by  national crisis/response centers to effec- tively receive, address, and transmit ur- gent information in a timely manner;  13  ©  2015 Cyber Readiness Index 2.0, all rights reserved.  Resources:  A. The identification of the financial and  human resources requested and allocat- ed for the National CSIRT to carry out its  mandate;  B. The identification of additional funding  to activate and regularly test the infor- mation warning and alert system, and to  measure the country’s resilience to cyber  incidents and crisis through national cy- ber security exercises;  Implementation:  A. A demonstrated capability in the incident  containment, management, resilience,  and recovery processes for critical ser- vices and infrastructures;  B. A demonstrated ability by national crisis/ response centers to address and transmit  alerts in a timely manner;  C. Evidence of ongoing research methods  analyzing trends or groups of comput- er security incidents of national con- cern—sharing similar actors or tactics,  techniques, and procedures—in order to  identify patterns; and  D. The development and implementation of  a system/program to regularly test and  measure the nation’s resilience to cyber  incidents and crises through national cy- ber security exercises.  Initial findings in this essential element are  based on the inventories of National CSIRTs  provided by the CERT Division at Carnegie  Mellon University (CMU),41 the European  Network and Information Security Agency  (ENISA),42 FIRST,43 and the ITU. Additional pri- mary and secondary sources, such as National  CSIRT’s websites and related news articles,  are consulted to determine if the capabili- ties exist and are funded. As countries come  to recognize the importance of establishing  National CSIRTs, updates to this essential el- ement will monitor, track, and evaluate those  developments.  3. E-CRIME AND LAW  ENFORCEMENT  The third essential element that indicates a  country’s cyber readiness is demonstrated  through its commitment to protect its society  against cyber crime. Cyber crime is not simply  a domestic issue; it transcends national bor- ders and therefore requires transnational solu- tions. Countries must show an international  commitment to secure society against e-crime.  Most often, this capability takes the form of  involvement with international fora dedicated  to addressing international cyber crime issues,  as well as the establishment of domestic legal  and regulatory mechanisms to combat cyber  crime. The pertinent legal and regulatory au- thorities designated with carrying out such  activities should define what constitutes a cy- ber crime and empower governmental entities  with the mechanisms, expertise, and resources  to investigate and effectively prosecute cyber  crime activities.  Two international treaty agreements help  demonstrate a country’s commitment to pro- tecting society against cyber crime: the Coun- cil of Europe’s “Convention on Cyber Crime”  and the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation’s  “Agreement on Cooperation in the Field on  Ensuring International Information Securi- ty”. The Council of Europe’s “Convention on  Cybercrime”, in force since July 1, 2004 and  ©  2015 Cyber Readiness Index 2.0, all rights reserved.  14  commonly called the Budapest Convention,  provides a mechanism through which to har- monize divergent national cyber crime laws and  encourage law enforcement collaboration.44  The effectiveness of the Budapest Convention  is somewhat limited because it allows signato- ry countries to selectively implement elements  of the Budapest Convention based upon find- ings that doing otherwise would “prejudice its  sovereignty, security, public order or other es- sential interests.”45 The Shanghai Cooperation  Organisation’s “Agreement on Cooperation in  the Field on Ensuring International Information  Security,” signed in 2009 and sometimes re- ferred to as the Yekaterinburg Agreement, has  principles consistent with the law enforcement  approach of the Budapest Convention. It too  seeks to improve the informational legal base  and establish practical mechanisms of coop- eration among the parties in ensuring interna- tional information security.46 Pursuant to these  treaties, countries agree to adopt appropriate  legislation, foster international cooperation,  and combat criminal offenses, by facilitating  their detection, investigation, and prosecution  both nationally and internationally. CRI 2.0  credits countries that have ratified or acceded  to either of these treaties because by doing so  a country has a specific obligation and duty un- der its domestic law to uphold a commitment  in an international context.  In addition to the international mechanisms  noted above, other international, multi-na- tional, and regional approaches towards ad- dressing international cyber crime exist and  are being pursued. For example, the United  Nations General Assembly (UNGA) has passed  a variety of resolutions relevant to cyber crime,  such as the 2001 “Combating the Criminal Mis- use of Information Technology,” and the 2003  “Creation of a Global Culture of Cybersecurity  and the Protection of Critical Infrastructures.”47  Notably, the UN Group of Government Experts  (GGE) that consists of twenty countries had a  break through moment when they agreed to  cooperate on prosecuting terrorist and criminal  use of ICT. Their commitments are codified in  the June 2015 GGE report On Developments  in the Field of Information and Telecommunica- tions in the Context of International Security.48  The APEC also conducted a capacity-building  project on cyber crime for member economies  to establish legal structures and build capacity  to investigate e-crime. As part of this project,  advanced APEC economies support other  member-economies by training legislative au- thorities and investigative personnel.49  The CRI 2.0 draws upon these international,  multi-national, and regional approaches to  assess a country’s cyber readiness. In addition,  the CRI 2.0 also includes country information  on cyber crime from the ASEAN, and the ITU,  among others.  While the intention to cooperate on cyber  crime may exist and the ratification of cyber  crime agreements is important, it does not  necessarily demonstrate readiness to combat  cyber crime. States must also work to proac- tively build domestic cyber law enforcement  capacity. For instance, the Advanced Centre  for Research, Development and Training in  Cyber Law and Forensics at the National Law  School of India University in Bangalore works  to translate the law into technical terms and  vice-versa by providing training and education  to judicial officers, prosecutors, investigative  agencies, cyber security personnel, technolo- gists, and others. Funded by the Department  of Electronics and Information Technology (De- itY) in the Indian Ministry of Communications  and Information Technology, the Centre pro- vides a unique hands-on training component  15  ©  2015 Cyber Readiness Index 2.0, all rights reserved.  in a cyber forensics lab that facilitates rapid  understanding of complex issues.50  Another example is the International Police  Organization’s (INTERPOL) recent launch of  an INTERPOL Global Complex for Innovation  (IGCI) in Singapore. This facility enables law  enforcement officials to partner with industry  to develop new training techniques and use  advanced tools to tackle cyber crime and  boost cyber security.51 For example, INTER- POL created a simulation game to teach law  enforcement officials about the intersection  and risk of the Darknet and crypto-currencies.  The Darknet has enabled an underground (il- legal) economy that sells personal identifiable  information (PII), military intelligence, weapons  designs, modular malware, zero-day exploits,  private encryption keys and credentials, and  many other types of illegally obtained data.  INTERPOL’s first simulation/training exercise  was conducted in July 2015.52  Apart from building e-crime and law en- forcement capacity, states must also work to  clean the infections in their networked infra- structures, known as botnets.53 Currently, an  estimated five to twelve percent of comput- ers worldwide are compromised as a part  of a botnet network. The FBI estimates that  eighteen systems are infected per second via  botnet armies, causing an estimated $110  billion in damages globally.54 Some countries  have worked to address this threat, with some  success. For example, the Canadian Govern- ment’s DarkSpace Project-Advanced Analytics  and Dark Space Analysis for Predictive Indica- tors of Cyber Activity—spearheaded by Bell  Canada and involving a team of experts from  Canadian government agencies, academic in- stitutions, and industry—made a business case  for a ‘clean pipes’ solution to cyber threats  by providing a compelling body of evidence  to support proactively containing threats to  Canada coming from the Internet. Findings  from the project made the business case for  a national clean pipes strategy and influenced  a Cyber Security Standard for Telecommuni- cations Service Providers.55 Another example,  in Japan, was The Cyber Clean Center, a five- year funded effort, operated by the Japanese  CERT (JPCERT) from 2006 to 2011.56 This Cen- ter was the result of a cross-disciplinary col- laboration among JP-CERT, various security  vendors, and Internet service providers (ISPs);  it created an automated “guardian network”  against botnet malware infection and exploita- tion. It also further provided tailor-made solu- tions to address specific malware on specific  computers.57 The Cyber Clean Center’s efforts  have continued at Telecom-ISAC Japan.58 Fi- nally, Australia’s iCode, a public-private part- nership through the Australian Internet Secu- rity Initiative (AISI), aims to promote a security  culture among ISPs by reducing the number of  compromised computing devices in Australia.  The iCode encourages all Australian ISPs to  Cyber crime and fraud are a  tax on economic growth.  Reducing the number of  infected networked devices  is an important investment  in combatting e-crime.  ©  2015 Cyber Readiness Index 2.0, all rights reserved.  16  join AISI, and provides AISI ISP members with  daily malware infection and service vulnerabil- ity data.59  Cyber crime and fraud are a tax on economic  growth. Cyber crime has reached an estimated  $445 billion worldwide, with a negative impact  on national economies of at least 1 percent of  GDP and upwards of two hundred thousand  lost jobs.60 An investment in combating cyber  crime and increasing law enforcement capacity  is a necessary investment for the economy. By  developing law enforcement capabilities to  fight e-crime through the ratification of treaty  documents, international cooperation, capac- ity development, the implementation of an- ti-botnet programs, and other initiatives, coun- tries can mitigate their cyber risks and boost  future economic growth.  Essential elements of a sound country-level  and international commitment to protecting  society against cyber crime should include:  Statement:  A. A demonstrated national and internation- al commitment to protect society against  cyber crime through ratifying international  cyber crime agreements or other equiva- lent agreement to fight cyber crime;  B. A demonstrated commitment to establish  national legal and policy mechanisms to  specifically reduce the criminal activity  emanating from the country and promote  coordination mechanisms to address in- ternational and national cyber crime;  Organization:  A. The establishment of a mature institution- al ability to fight cyber crime, including  training for court judges, prosecutors,  lawyers, law enforcement officials, foren- sic specialists, and other investigators;  B. The establishment of a coordinating agen- cy with a primary mission and authority to  ensure that all international cyber crime  requirements are being met domesti- cally and across jurisdictional lines (i.e.,  cross-border cooperation);  Resources:  A. The identification of financial and human  resources requested and allocated for  fighting cyber crime;  B. The establishment of an accounting  mechanism to determine what percent- age of annual GDP is affected by cyber  crime (actual loss in real currency), in or- der to assess national systemic cost-ben- efit tradeoffs and allocate resources  accordingly;  Implementation:  A. Demonstrable evidence of a country’s  commitment to review and update ex- isting laws and regulatory governance  mechanisms, identify where gaps and  overlapping authorities may reside, and  clarify and prioritize areas that require  modernization (e.g. existing laws, such as  old telecommunications law);  B. The establishment of criminal offenses  under domestic law for actions directed  against the confidentiality, integrity, and  availability of computer systems, net- works, and computer data as well as the  misuse of such systems, networks, and  data, to include the international infringe- ment of copyright; and  17  ©  2015 Cyber Readiness Index 2.0, all rights reserved.  C. Demonstrable evidence of a country’s  effectiveness in reducing infections em- anating from its own infrastructures and  networks (e.g. creation of anti-botnet and  malware remediation initiatives).  Initial findings in this essential element are  based upon a review of whether a country has  ratified or acceded to the Budapest Conven- tion or the Shanghai Cooperation Organisa- tion’s Yekaterinburg Agreement and whether  the country is an active participant in regional,  multi-national, or international approaches  towards addressing cyber crime. Additionally,  current botnet activity (both command and  attacks—which can have significant implica- tions for global telecommunications, trade,  and business—requires more than traditional  monitoring and protection mechanisms. Glob- ally, most governments and organizations have  established information sharing programs to  better understand risks posed by state and  non-state actors and managed their exposure  to vulnerabilities and subsequent infections  and breaches.  Formal information sharing mechanisms, simi- lar to some of the services provided by Nation- al CSIRTs and CERTs, can help foster coordi- nation in incident response, facilitate real-time  Information sharing must be underpinned by  trust and buy-in from all stakeholders.  control nodes and total infections) emanating  from the country is used to assess the effec- tiveness of anti-botnet initiatives. The CRI 2.0  draws on primary and secondary sources to  determine whether a country has established  legal and regulatory mechanisms, other risk  reduction activities, and allocated funding to  ensure successful execution. Updates to this  essential element will monitor, track, and eval- uate substantive and notable developments.  4. INFORMATION SHARING  The fourth element that indicates a country’s  cyber readiness is its ability to establish and  maintain information sharing mechanisms that  enable the exchange of actionable intelligence  and/or information between governments and  industry sectors. Key activities such as identi- fying, assessing, and responding to targeted  sharing of threat and intelligence information,  and help improve understanding of how sec- tors are targeted, what information is lost, and  what methods can be used to defend informa- tion assets. At least four different models for  information sharing have emerged to address  cyber threats and to help entities secure their  information assets: (1) government driven; (2)  industry driven; (3) non-profit-partnership driv- en; and (4) a hybrid academic-, government-,  and industry-partnership driven model. Each  method has its unique challenges, such as  balancing the need for exchanging timely and  actionable cyber security information while  protecting data’s confidentiality, safeguarding  civil liberties, and managing competing finan- cial and human resources and interests. Two  factors, however, are required for any of the  four models to succeed: buy-in and trust, which  must be underpinned by clearly defined objec-  ©  2015 Cyber Readiness Index 2.0, all rights reserved.  18  tives, roles, responsibilities, and outcomes. Put  simply, when a party participates reluctantly or  defensively, success is hard to achieve.61  Moreover, stakeholders must be able to share  valuable information on serious incidents,  which requires clear definitions of what type  of information should be shared, who will  have access to it, and what security measures  should be taken to protect the information  once released by its original owner. The com- plexity of this sensitive information exchange  grows proportionately with group size, and  perhaps exponentially when those group  members are sovereign states with distinct  national security concerns.  Many individual countries have already de- veloped strong national information sharing  programs that could be leveraged as good  practices for other countries to learn from.  These programs tend to focus on aligning sim- ilar stakeholders into groups and subsequently  aligning the groups into a national program.  The Netherlands, for instance, created the  National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC)—a  government driven initiative that evolved from  the Dutch GOVCERT into a successful pub- lic-private partnership—responsible for digital  security and information sharing in the coun- try.62 One of its main tasks is to continuously  monitor all (potentially) suspect sources on the  Internet and alert public authorities and orga- nizations of any identified cyber threat. NCSC  is also directly connected to all Information  Sharing and Analyses Centres (ISACs) in the  country and information is shared under the  Traffic Light Protocol (TLP), which classifies in- formation into four levels: red, yellow, green,  and white. The Dutch information sharing pro- gram was modeled after the United Kingdom  National Infrastructure Security Coordination  Centre (NISCC), which delivered focused in- formation security advice to critical national  infrastructure businesses.63 Similarly, Japan’s  Information-Technology Promotion Agency  (IPA), acts as the institutional authority charged  with sharing information between govern- ment and critical industries, and has a proven  track record establishing trusted relationships  with all major companies in the country and  providing timely and effective intelligence. In  addition, IPA works closely with the Ministry of  Economy, Trade, and Industry (METI), the Na- tional Information Security Center (NISC), and  the Cyber Rescue Advice Team (J-CRAT) to  respond to all major cyber incidents affecting  critical infrastructure.64  Alternatively, in the United States, the Finan- cial Services Information Sharing and Analysis  Center (FS-ISAC)—an industry driven initiative  developed by the financial services sector— helps facilitate the detection, prevention, and  response to cyber incidents and fraud activity.  It has built strong ties with financial service pro- viders; commercial security firms; federal/na- tional, state, and local government agencies;  law enforcement; and other trusted entities to  provide reliable and timely cyber threat alerts  and other critical information to member firms  worldwide. As part of these efforts, FS-ISAC  uses a different Traffic Light Protocol to deter- mine which audiences can and should receive  specific information.65 FS-ISAC is expanding  its threat information sharing internationally to  the United Kingdom and Europe. Other ISAC’s  also exist across many sectors, however are not  as effective.  The National Cyber-Forensics and Training Alli- ance (NCFTA) in the United States is a non-profit  19  ©  2015 Cyber Readiness Index 2.0, all rights reserved.  corporation with a mission to facilitate collabora- tion among private industry, academia, and law  enforcement to identify, mitigate, and neutralize  complex cyber-related threats. In addition to  state and local law enforcement and industry  representatives, this non-profit partnership-driv- en initiative enjoys international representation  from Canada, Australia, United Kingdom, India,  Germany, the Netherlands, Ukraine, and Lithu- ania. NCFTA provides streamlined and timely  exchange of cyber threat intelligence to corpo- rations, and also partners with subject matter  experts in the public, private, law enforcement,  and academic sectors to mitigate risks and  fraudulent activities and gather the evidence  necessary to prosecute criminals.66  cies collect valuable cyber-related information,  and some have started to declassify this type  of intelligence and share it with other govern- ment entities and critical industries. Indeed,  real-time situational awareness is often key  to prevent or mitigate specific cyber threats.  Some countries, such as Brazil, have devised  mechanisms to declassify (write-for-release)  actionable information alerting other entities  (public and private) to vulnerabilities, specific  threats and tactics, and potential defensive  solutions as part of their information sharing  initiatives.67 Enhancing the defensive posture  of the country is essential and some countries  are willing to declassify portions of intelligence  to better ensure security.  The ability of a country to exchange timely,  accurate, and actionable information—within  and between public and private sector entities  —helps reduce vulnerabilities and exposure  that can subsequently reduce attendant risks.  As information sharing increases in frequency  and quality, entities should be able to address  cyber threats to their networked infrastructures  in a faster and more proactive manner. Estab- lishing and maintaining actionable information  sharing programs is a fundamental investment  for economic growth.  Elements of an effective national, cross-sector,  and actionable information sharing program  should include:  Statement:  A. The articulation and dissemination of a  policy on information sharing across sec- tors that enables the exchange of action- able intelligence/information between  governments and industry sectors;  Real-time actionable information  is key to mitigating cyber threats.  Finally, Norway’s Center for Cyber and Infor- mation Security (CCIS) at Gjøvik University Col- lege is a joint initiative (academia, government,  and industry) and represents another approach  to information sharing and collaboration on  cyber security. CCIS promotes a systematic  country-wide approach to cyber and informa- tion security and provides information sharing  schema to safeguard society’s ability to de- tect, alert, and handle serious cyber incidents.  Additionally, it supports high quality national  research and development of solutions in the  field of cyber and information security.  In addition to the various information sharing  programs that countries are developing, most  governments’ defense and intelligence agen-  ©  2015 Cyber Readiness Index 2.0, all rights reserved.  20  Organization:  A. The identification of an institutional struc- ture that transmits authoritative informa- tion from government sources to gov- ernment agencies and critical industries  (Government-to-Government);  B. The identification of an institutional struc- ture that ensures that mechanisms exist  (reporting schema, technology, etc.) for  cross-sector incident information ex- change (bi-directional), both operational  (near-real-time) and forensic (post-facto)  (Government-Industry/Industry-Industry);  C. The establishment of an academic or  non-profit driven mechanism for vulner- ability, incident, or solution information  exchange (alternative model, for exam- ple, NCFTA or the National Vulnerability  Database);68  Resources:  A. The identification of the financial and hu- man resources requested and allocated  for the government driven authoritative  information exchange or other institution- al structure(s) dedicated to the informa- tion sharing mechanisms;  Implementation:  A. Demonstrable evidence that cross-sec- tor and cross-stakeholder coordination  mechanisms meant to address critical  interdependencies—including incident  situational awareness and cross-sector  and cross-stakeholder incident manage- ment—are adequately maintained and  tested for effective performance; and  B. Demonstrable evidence of the ability and  timely processes for the government to  declassify (write-for-release) usable cy- ber-related intelligence information and  share it with the rest of government and  critical industries.69  Initial findings in this essential element are  based upon a review of whether a country has  established information sharing and other co- ordination mechanisms. Drawing upon primary  and secondary sources, the CRI 2.0 determines  whether such mechanisms exist and are prop- erly funded. Updates to this essential element  will monitor, track, and evaluate substantive  and notable developments.  5. INVESTMENT IN RESEARCH  AND DEVELOPMENT  The fifth element that indicates a country’s cy- ber readiness is establishing a national priority  for and investment in cyber security basic and  applied research and ICT initiatives broadly.  Advances in ICT have revolutionized almost  every sector of the economy, transforming  businesses, governments, education, and the  way citizens live, work, and play. These innova- tions drive economic growth and can enhance  resilience and set the conditions for a strong  security posture.  Government and businesses each have a role  to play and can combine the power of their  R&D budgets to enhance the next generation  of ICT and Internet-enabled technologies and  solutions. Businesses and governments are em- bracing mobile Internet, cloud computing, big  data, quantum computing, and the Internet of  Things (IoT), and must invest in the trust, secu- rity, and resilience of these digital services and  technologies. By investing in cyber R&D and  21  ©  2015 Cyber Readiness Index 2.0, all rights reserved.  other innovations, countries, universities, and  companies can improve their ability to close  the gap between their cyber insecurity and at- tacker capabilities. For example, the European  Union’s Horizon 2020 program has allocated  an estimated €80 billion for research and tech- nological development initiatives. With the Eu- ropean Union’s foundational principle of open  access, the program intends to boost research  results, accelerate innovation, create greater  efficiency, and improve transparency. Horizon  2020 has three main components. The first area  focuses on basic and applied science, entitled,  “Excellent Science,” and plans to fund doctoral  training for an additional twenty-five thousand  PhD candidates during the next seven years.  The second area focuses on “Leadership in  Enabling and Industrial Technologies,” with an  emphasis on ICT, nanotechnologies, advanced  materials, and processing, among others. The  third area funds solutions to address social and  economic problems, such as health, energy,  transportation, and security. One of the evalu- ation criteria for this investment is transnational  cooperation among companies and solutions  that meet pan-European needs.70  cyber-physical systems, cyber security and  privacy R&D, high-end computing, and wire- less-spectrum sharing.71 The NITRD program is  the United State’s primary source of federally  funded work on advanced information technol- ogies in computing, networking, and software.  The program seeks to accelerate the develop- ment and deployment of advanced information  technologies to enhance national defense and  homeland security as well as improve United  States productivity and economic competi- tiveness. Additionally, the Defense Advanced  Research Projects Agency (DARPA), the Intel- ligence Advanced Research Projects Activity  (IARPA), and the Homeland Security Advanced  Research Projects Agency (HSARPA) also have  funding dedicated to cyber R&D. However, if  the entire cyber R&D budget were to be add- ed together, the total amount would still be  the equivalent of less than 1 percent of United  States GDP. Based on the enormity of current  and future United States cyber risks, 1 percent  of GDP is inadequate to close the cyber inse- curity gap.  Other government-sponsored initiatives en- courage cyber security innovation by offering  market incentives such as R&D tax credits. For  instance, recognizing that spurring organiza- tional and corporate investment often requires  government encouragement and commit- ment, Israel recently approved significant tax  breaks for cyber defense companies that join  and establish activities at their national cyber  park in Be’er Sheva.72 By encouraging a unique  industry-academia-military ecosystem through  the co-location of technical talent, Israel is cre- ating an economic and strategic cyber security  hub. Be’er Sheva’s cyber park also increases  private-public partnerships in the cyber field;  serves as a center of excellence for innovation;  and provides an effective training and employ- ment pipeline.  Cyber security R&D innovation  must enhance the trust,  security, and resilience of our  future networked society.  Similarly, the United States prioritizes, coordi- nates, and dedicates over $4 billion annually  toward cross-cutting research through the Na- tional Information Technology and Research  and Development (NITRD) program. Priority  research areas for 2016-2020 include: big data,  ©  2015 Cyber Readiness Index 2.0, all rights reserved.  22  Grants and scholarships are another market  mechanism used to advance cyber security ed- ucation, develop knowledge, and build skills.  For instance, the Brazilian government’s “Sci- ence without Borders” program offers schol- arships in all STEM fields, including computer  science and information technology. Likewise,  the National Council for Scientific and Techno- logical Development (CNPq), an agency within  the Ministry of Science, Technology, and Inno- vation, provides a “Science Initiation Schol- arship” to incentivize ICT education in young  students.73  Cyber Incident Experience Lab. Current proj- ects include building an advanced malware  detection platform and delivering solutions  for detecting, reporting, and managing cyber  vulnerabilities through qualitative scanners.74  Other private sector “cyber innovation hubs”  have emerged in Silicon Valley, Tel Aviv, Bos- ton, New York City, and London. For instance,  London’s cyber innovation hub, titled CyLon or  Cyber London, is Europe’s first cyber security  startup accelerator. CyLon works to foster the  cyber innovation ecosystem in London and  helps businesses develop information security  related products.75  These various R&D initiatives and cyber inno- vation hubs accelerate the transfer of ideas  and technologies into solutions to advance  the digital marketplace, improve the security  and resilience of underlying networks and in- frastructures, and improve societal well being.  Elements of a country’s commitment to ad- vance its cyber R&D, education, and capacity  building efforts should include:  Statement:  A. A publicly announced commitment by the  government to invest nationally in cyber  security basic and applied research;  B. Publicly announced incentive mechanisms  (e.g., R&D tax credit) to encourage cyber  security innovation and dissemination  of new findings, baseline technologies,  techniques, processes, and tools;  Cyber Innovation hubs accelerate  the transfer of ideas and  technologies into solutions.  Cyber security innovation centers, such as  the Hague Security Delta (HSD), foster in- novative cyber security R&D and promote  collaboration among private sector compa- nies, governments, and research institutions.  HSD, a foundation supported by the Munic- ipality of the Hague and the Dutch Ministry  of Economic Affairs, is the largest security  network in Europe with knowledge bridges  to the main security networks in the United  States, Canada, Singapore, and South Africa.  Its cyber security program includes initiatives  such as the Cyber Security Academy and the  23  ©  2015 Cyber Readiness Index 2.0, all rights reserved.  C. Publicly announced government incen- tive mechanisms (e.g., grants, scholar- ships) to encourage cyber security ed- ucation, knowledge creation, and skills  development;  Organization:  A. The identification of at least one entity  with the responsibility to oversee national  cyber security R&D initiatives and serve as  a national and international point-of-con- tact for collaboration;  B. The establishment of institutionally sup- ported degree programs in cyber security,  information security or similar advanced  technology areas that focus on security  and resilience of the digital environment;  C. The establishment of an entity with the  mission to measure and report on the rate  of government or commercial successfully  transitioned programs (from research to  product/service) with a focus on the solu- tions that improve security and resilience  of the digital environment;  Resources:  A. The identification of financial and human  resources requested and allocated for  cyber security basic and applied research  and initiatives;  B. The identification of financial and human  resources requested and allocated for  commercial or government transfer of en- hanced technology and innovation;  Implementation:  A. The implementation of programs dedi- cated to the development, dissemination,  and routinization of interoperable and  secure technical standards, acceptable to  and reinforced by internationally recog- nized standards bodies;  B. Evidence of national government efforts  to support, advance, and sustain cyber  security R&D, especially as demonstrated  in terms of the research/production con- version rate (e.g., percentage implement- ed operationally within the government)  and of the commercial adoption rate of  successfully transitioned programs; and  C. Evidence of additional commercial efforts  (e.g. cyber innovation hubs) to support,  advance, and sustain cyber security R&D,  especially in terms of the research/product  conversion rate (e.g. percentage imple- mented operationally within the private  sector) and of the government adoption  rate of successfully transitioned programs  from the commercial sector.  Initial findings in this essential element are  based upon a review of whether a country is  investing in cyber R&D, education, knowledge  creation, and skills development—in addi- tion to funding cyber security initiatives more  broadly. Drawing on primary and secondary  sources, the CRI 2.0 determines the type, if  any, of government incentive mechanisms al- ready in place and the resources dedicated to  initiatives similar to the ones discussed above.  Updates to this essential element will monitor,  track, and evaluate substantive and notable  developments.  ©  2015 Cyber Readiness Index 2.0, all rights reserved.  24  6. DIPLOMACY AND TRADE  The sixth essential element of cyber readiness  is demonstrated through a country’s engage- ment with cyber issues as part of its foreign  policy. At a fundamental level, cyber diplo- macy seeks to find mutually acceptable solu- tions to common challenges. Cyber issues are  emerging in many different international rela- tions areas including human rights, economic  development, trade agreements, arms control  and dual use technologies, security, stability,  and peace and conflict resolution. While cyber  security issues are entangled in almost every  topic and most negotiators are experts in a  specific topic area (i.e., trade or arms control),  those experts are often not familiar with the  added opportunities or risks that emerge in a  cyber context. Therefore, establishing a dedi- cated office or personnel whose primary focus  is diplomatic engagement on cyber issues  should be an integral component of a country’s  foreign policy.  Given the slow pace of the economic recovery,  many countries are pursuing new international  economic policies enshrined in trade agree- ments as a means to accelerate growth and  create market opportunities. Yet, these eco- nomic initiatives are becoming venues where  national security concerns are being negoti- ated, sub-rosa. For example, the Trans-Pacific  Partnership (TPP) agreement was reached on  5 October 2015. The agreement’s objective is  to enhance trade and investment among TPP  partner countries, promote innovation, eco- nomic growth and development, and support  the creation and retention of jobs. It took five  years to reach this agreement, in part because  of cyber issues. Partner countries could not  agree on key issues, including data protection  and privacy requirements (e.g., intellectual  property protection), data localization desires,  and content restrictions.  The United States and the European Union  are negotiating a Transatlantic Trade and In- vestment Partnership (TTIP), which is a similar  agreement to the TPP. This agreement seeks to  increase market access, eliminate unnecessary  regulatory hurdles, establish rules to govern the  entangled commercial relationships between  the two regions, create jobs, and promote GDP  growth.76 Two of the core issues that are de- laying this negotiation are data protection and  At a fundamental level, cyber  diplomacy seeks to find  mutually acceptable solutions  to common challenges.  privacy. For the past decade, Europe and the  United States have agreed to common protec- tion standards for the transfer and storage of  all personal data, which moves and/or resides  between the European Union and the United  States.77 However, the leaked documents by  Edward Snowden exposed the United States  government’s intelligence services’ collection  activities on other governments and citizens,  leading to a breakdown of trust among and be- tween governments. As a result, many Europe- an countries are demanding the establishment  of mutual state-level privacy standards, encryp- tion rules, and legal frameworks, in order to  keep pace with rapidly advancing technology  and also hold states accountable for adequate  protection of the data. Additionally, a recent  Court of Justice of the European Union ruling  has negated the long-standing agreement  of “Safe Harbor” data protection standards  between the European Union and the United  States. The Safe Harbor executive decision had  25  ©  2015 Cyber Readiness Index 2.0, all rights reserved.  allowed United States companies to self-certify  to provide “adequate protection” for Europe- an users’ data in compliance with the European  data protection directive and with fundamental  European rights, such as privacy. While negoti- ations are ongoing to update Safe Harbor, no  time frame has been provided for completion,  further complicating TTIP negotiations.78 At  present, the American Chamber of Commerce  to the European Union estimates that reversing  Safe Harbor could cost the European Union up  to 1.3 percent of GDP.79  Another regionally based free trade agree- ment, the Regional Comprehensive Economic  Partnership (RCEP) is currently under negoti- ation among ASEAN member states, China,  India, Japan, Korea, Australia, and New Zea- land. The sixteen participating RCEP countries  account for almost half of the world’s popula- tion, nearly 30 percent of global GDP, and over  one quarter of the world exports. The goal of  the RCEP is to lower trade barriers, promote  economic and technical cooperation, protect  intellectual property, encourage competition,  facilitate dispute settlement, and improve mar- ket access for exporters of goods and services.  As part of these negotiations, some countries  are seeking to include mechanisms that protect  their data, asserting a right to data sovereignty  for national security purposes.80  There is also an entire series of negotiations  underway in the security arena, focusing upon  technologies. For example, the Wassenaar  Arrangement on Export Controls for Conven- tional Arms and Dual-Use Goods and Technol- ogies, which has forty-one signatories including  the United States, United Kingdom, Russia, and  most European Union states, recently agreed  to curb the sale of Internet “communications  surveillance systems” and “intrusion software”  that are specially designed or modified to  avoid detection by monitoring tools, or to de- feat protective countermeasures.81 States have  different concerns on the dual-purpose appli- cations of these technologies. For instance, a  vulnerability assessment tool often uses zero  day exploitations to discover networked vulner- abilities. These same techniques can be used  as weapons. Therefore, bringing these technol- ogies under export control regimes reflects the  belief that advanced technologies may defeat  countries’ national defenses and present a na- tional security risk.  Other diplomatic negotiations and discussions  are ongoing that seek to establish a common  understanding and/or rules to increase stabili- ty and security in the global ICT environment.  This includes strengthening cooperative mech- anisms to address ICT security incidents and  address ICT infrastructure-related requests  (e.g., illegal activity emitting from a country  due to a bot-net infection). Diplomacy is also  being used to define what type of cyber activ- ities should and should not be permitted (e.g.,  standards for responsible state behavior), com- monly referred to as cyber norms of behavior.  For example, the United Nations GGE recently  highlighted the global nature of the ICT envi- ronment, existing and potential threats in the  sphere of information security, and possible  cooperative measures to address those threats.  The GGE found that adherence to internation- al law, particularly UN Charter obligations,  provides an essential framework for states’ ICT  use. They agreed to pursue a framework for  cyber norms, rules or principles for responsible  state behavior, and confidence-building mea- sures (CBMs).82 Among the CBMs, the GGE  agreed to strengthen cooperative mechanisms  between relevant state agencies in order to  address ICT security incidents and develop ad- ditional technical, legal, and diplomatic mech- anisms to address ICT infrastructure-related  ©  2015 Cyber Readiness Index 2.0, all rights reserved.  26  requests (e.g., establish a CSIRT or other offi- cial organization to fulfill such roles). Most re- cently, United States President Barack Obama  and Chinese President Xi Jinping agreed (in  principle) to follow the GGE recommendations  and adhere to UN-established norms of online  behavior; especially those governing the use  of cyber attacks to harm the other’s critical in- frastructure during peacetime.83  Building upon some of the common themes  from the GGE, the leaders of Brazil, Russian,  India, China, and South Africa (BRICS) agreed  to cooperate with each other in order to ad- dress common ICT security challenges. They  agreed to share information and best practices  relating to the security of ICT use, coordinate  against cyber crime, es- tablish a POC network  in member-states, and  establish intra-BRICS co- operation using the ex- isting CSIRTs. They also  urged the international  community to focus its  efforts on CBMs, capac- ity building, the non-use  of force, and the pre- vention of ICT enabled conflicts.84 Moreover,  in January 2015, the SCO introduced a revised  international code of conduct for information  security to the UNGA, which sought to identify  the rights and responsibilities of states in the  information space, promote constructive and  responsive behavior, and enhance coopera- tion to address mutual ICT threats.85 The SCO  revised the 2011 Code of Conduct language  with language from the 2012 and 2013 GGE  reports, in order to broaden appeal for the  Code of Conduct among G-77 members.  Other international venues co-mingle econom- ic, development, and security topics as they  pursue specific goals. The ITU, for example,  carries out regular international discussions  on the policy, technology, and regulatory en- vironment of ICT and the Internet during four  of its global meetings: the World Summit on  the Information Society (WSIS), the World Con- ference on International Telecommunications  (WCIT), the World Telecommunication Devel- opment Conference (WTDC), and the World  Telecommunications Standardization Assem- bly (WTSA).86 In addition, the OAS and the IDB  have joined forces to work with their member  states to systematically address cyber security  as part of three issue areas: (1) development  that is both socially inclusive and environmen- tally sustainable; (2) ICT as a tool to generate  income and employment, provide access to  businesses and infor- mation, enable e-learn- ing, and facilitate gov- ernment activities; and  (3) security of their core  infrastructures and citi- zen facing services.87  Clearly, cyber security  issues are emerging  across a wide variety of  diplomatic venues. Cyber security is not only a  security problem; it is a fundamental element  of trade, foreign and economic policy, and a  country’s future economic growth potential.  Key components of a country’s ability to ef- fectively engage diplomatically on cyber-re- lated issues include the establishment of a  dedicated and trained cadre of personnel, the  development of specific organizational struc- tures, and the allocation of funding devoted to  international discussions and negotiations on  issues pertaining to cyber security. For exam- ple, Israel and the Czech Republic have placed  cyber attachés in their embassies in key cities,  to include Washington DC and Brussels.88  Cyber security is entangled  in all components of  foreign policy and trade.  27  ©  2015 Cyber Readiness Index 2.0, all rights reserved.  Additionally, the United States conducted a  one-week training cyber awareness program  for diplomatic personnel assigned to Asia.89  Developing this cadre of personnel is increas- ingly essential for a country to realize its future  foreign policy, economic policy, trade, and  economic growth goals.  Elements of a sound diplomatic cyber security  engagement capability should include:  Statement:  A. The announced identification of cyber se- curity as an essential element of foreign  policy and national security (e.g. Official  discussions typically involving high-level  political and military leaders in bilateral  and multilateral discussions);  B. The announced identification of ICT and  cyber security as an essential element of  international economic policy, negotia- tions, trade, and commerce;  Organization:  A. The establishment of dedicated and  trained personnel in the country’s foreign  office or equivalent organization whose  primary mission includes active engage- ment internationally in cyber security  diplomacy;  B. A demonstrated consistency between  the numbers and ranks of dedicated for- eign cyber diplomatic personnel and the  announced commitment of a country to  engage in cyber security diplomacy as a  top tier issue of national importance;  Resources:  A. The identification of the financial and hu- man resources requested and allocated  for cyber diplomatic engagement;  Implementation:  A. Demonstrated participation in defining,  signing, and enforcing international,  multi-national, regional and/or bilateral  agreements pursuing mutually acceptable  solutions to common challenges; and  B. Demonstrated evidence of efforts to  influence international trade and com- merce negotiations that pertain to the  use of ICT or the internationally, region- ally, and/or nationally shared aspects of  cyber infrastructure, critical services, and  technologies.  Initial findings in this essential element are  based upon a review of whether a country has  explicitly designated or established a govern- mental office or charged individuals with dip- lomatic responsibilities that include both the  economic and security aspects of cyber issues.  The CRI 2.0 draws upon primary and second- ary sources to determine whether and to what  degree governmental office(s) or individuals  participate in and influence international nego- tiations on issues pertaining to cyber security.  Updates to this essential element will monitor,  track, and evaluate substantive and notable  developments.  7. DEFENSE AND CRISIS RESPONSE  The seventh and final element of cyber readi- ness is the ability of a country’s national armed  forces and/or related defense agency to de-  ©  2015 Cyber Readiness Index 2.0, all rights reserved.  28  fend the country from threats emanating from  cyberspace. Countries interested in this type of  capability are directing their defense forces to  establish capacity or expertise to respond to  cyber threats that rise to the level of nationally  critical “cybered” conflicts.90  Countries are becoming more connected and  Internet-dependent that in turn is making them  more vulnerable to disruptive and destructive  cyber activities. Most countries’ defensive pos- tures are weak in the face of sophisticated cy- ber attacks. The globally connected nature of  modern competitions and conflicts encourage  cyber-enabled adversaries to move laterally  across national systems and target a country’s  commercial and non-state organizations. For  example, in August 2012, Saudi Aramco suf- fered a targeted attack that used malicious  software to destroy data and damage nearly  seventy five percent of the company’s IT infra- structure.91 Corporate officials claimed that the  disrupted the control systems at a German  Steel Mill, causing its blast furnace to shut  down improperly, which resulted in significant  damages.93 The same year, Sony pictures fell  victim to a cyber attack where unreleased mo- tion pictures were illegally copied, corporate  emails were stolen and then leaked, and finan- cial documents were exposed. Sensitive data  on tens of thousands of Sony employees were  copied, and nearly 80 percent of the compa- ny’s IT assets were destroyed, from data to  hardware, by virulent malware.94  Countries must be prepared to defend their  connected and networked interests for current  and future conflicts. The speed and reach of  the Internet helps connect all aspects of soci- ety and provides easy access to military-grade  cyber weapons, giving an asymmetric advan- tage to many. Indeed, the diversity of malicious  actors including political activists, criminals,  terrorists, state and non-state actors—all with  Disruptive and destructive cyber activities  requires a credible cyber defense.  incident was intended to affect oil production.  A few months later, in March 2013, multiple  financial institutions in South Korea, including  Shinhan Bank—the country’s fourth largest  bank—suffered damages from malware simi- lar to those used against Saudi Aramco. The  bank’s e-services were disrupted and data was  destroyed. The economic damages from this  incident were estimated to have reached ap- proximately $800 billion dollars.92 In December  2014, hackers successfully manipulated and  differing motives underscores the need to pre- pare for worst-case scenarios. At present, more  than sixty countries have developed capabili- ties for cyber espionage and attack, while also  demonstrating considerable interest in acquir- ing or developing defensive and pre-emptive  offensive capabilities.95 Additionally, countries  have started to devise different strategies and  tools to upgrade their national level cyber de- fenses. Most governments have instinctively  looked to increase the existing defensive ca-  29  ©  2015 Cyber Readiness Index 2.0, all rights reserved.  pabilities of their security agencies that already  are capable of operating in, through, and as  enabled by cyberspace outside their national  borders (i.e. the defense organization or intel- ligence services). Others have sought to place  these capabilities in security organizations not  directly located within their military structure.96  For instance, in 2010 the United States estab- lished a dedicated military unit—the United  States Cyber Command—to defend against  cyber threats to military infrastructure. Its mis- sion was expanded in 2015 when the Depart- ment of Defense’s (DoD) published its second  Cyber Strategy to guide the development of  DoD cyber forces (under the command and  control of United States Cyber Command) and  to strengthen its cyber defenses and cyber de- terrence posture. This new strategy highlights  the need to be “prepared to defend the United  States homeland and United States vital inter- ests from disruptive or destructive cyber attacks  of significant consequence,” and to build,  maintain, and use viable cyber options to con- trol conflict escalation and shape the combat  environment at all stages.97  Similarly, in December 2014, the Russian  Federation released its new Military Doctrine  that highlights Russia’s development of cyber  warfare capabilities for both offensive and  defensive purposes as well as “non-nuclear  deterrence.”98 Russia’s 2011 Ministry of De- fense White Paper, “Conceptual Views on the  Activities of the Armed Forces of the Russian  Federation in Information Space,” parallels  aspects of the Russian Defense Doctrine, but  also explicitly includes public opinion and the  need to keep the media abreast of evolving  conflict situations for de-escalation purpos- es.99 According to the Russian media, Russia’s  leadership plans to release a new Information  Security Doctrine in 2016, which allegedly will  propose to develop forces for information  warfare and information systems for strategic  deterrence and the prevention of conflicts.100  The Republic of South Korea (ROK) and Brazil  have also established similar military organiza- tions aimed at securing offensive, defensive,  and response capabilities as well as ensuring  complete victory in cyber warfare.101 South Ko- rea has been expanding its cyber capabilities  and is reportedly training over four hundred  new cyber troops for its ROK Defense Cyber  Command, bringing the total to around one  thousand.102  Additionally, while the People’s Republic of  China (PRC) has not publicly issued any for- mal strategic doctrine for cyber or information  military applications, it has published Military  Strategic Guidelines that provides direction for  defense policy.103 The PRC’s 2013 White Paper:  the Diversified Employment of China’s Armed  Forces and the 2014 “Opinion on Further  Strengthening Information Security Work,”  stress the development of defensive cyber ca- pabilities. The documents emphasize that the  People’s Liberation Army (PLA) will not attack  unless attacked, but if attacked, will counterat- tack in cyberspace.104  A cyber defense agency need not be a uni- formed agency within the nation’s military.  National police and intelligence forces can  be the loci of a government’s central capacity  to defend in cyberspace, although the armed  forces will also need to be modernized and  cyber ready for more traditional conflicts. For  example, Iceland has concentrated its cyber  responses outside its armed forces. In the past,  Icelandic cyber security responsibilities were  informally divided among the Ministry of the  ©  2015 Cyber Readiness Index 2.0, all rights reserved.  30  Interior, the Post and Telecom Administration,  the Data Protection Authority, and the Icelan- dic Police. However, in 2015 Iceland central- ized all of its cyber capabilities under the Na- tional Commissioner of the Icelandic Police.105  Iceland’s June 2015 national cyber strategy  also highlights the integral role of the NATO  alliance to Iceland’s cyber defense.106  Finally, while Israel does not presently have a  formalized “cyber command,” its cyber securi- ty capabilities exist and are dispersed through- out the Israeli Defense Force (IDF) and the  Military Intelligence Directorate. The Military  Intelligence Directorate handles offensive ca- pabilities, while the services deal with protec- tion. Shin Bet, Israel’s internal security service,  is responsible for defending government sys- tems and critical national infrastructure, and the  National Cybernetic Taskforce secures critical  networks and private industry against hacking  and espionage.107 This may change, however,  because in June 2015, Lt. Gen. Gadi Eisenkot,  commander of the Israeli Army, declared his in- tent to establish a new IDF corps—on par with  the Navy and Air Force—responsible for all  cyber activity. Should the defense minister ap- prove the new corps, the new cyber IDF would  be operational within two years. Once opera- tional, the new Cyber Command will integrate  defensive capabilities currently provided by  the IDF with offensive and intelligence capac- ity performed by Unit 8200 and other military  intelligence communities.108 This aligns with  the new IDF five-year plan, “Gideon,” which  was published in August 2015. “Gideon” spe- cifically calls for increased initiatives to fend off  cyber attacks and other asymmetric threats,  which may emanate from non-state and terror- ist groups in the region.109  A cyber defense capability is necessary for a  country to ensure its national and economic  security. As countries become more reliant on  the Internet and ICT systems, the more vul- nerable they will become to “low level” cyber  threats and asymmetric activity. Countries are  faced with a Catch-22, greater ICT uptake is  essential for growth, but the more connected  a country becomes the more risks they incur.  Opting out of the Internet economy is no lon- ger an option. Countries must be prepared to  defend themselves in cyberspace. If a country  is unable to defend itself, it is not cyber ready.  Elements of a country’s commitment to de- velop and deploy dedicated national defense  units with cyber defense capabilities/responsi- bilities may include:  Statement:  A. The publication of national statements  that assign an organization the nation- al cyber defense mission as a top tier  mission;  B. The establishment of policies for the cy- ber defense organization to respond to  cyber threats;  C. The articulation of national statements  that direct the cyber defense organization  to develop capacity to respond to threats  within or outside the sovereign territory;  Organization:  A. The establishment of a national-level  organization, within the military, whose  primary mission is the cyber defense of  the nation;  B. The establishment of a national-level or- ganization, not within the military, whose  primary mission is the cyber defense of  the nation;  31  ©  2015 Cyber Readiness Index 2.0, all rights reserved.  Resources:  A. The identification of financial and human  resources requested and allocated for the  organization, within the military, whose  mission explicitly includes the cyber de- fense of the nation;  B. The identification of the financial and hu- man resources requested and allocated  for the organization, not within the mili- tary, whose mission explicitly includes the  cyber defense of the nation;  Implementation:  A. Evidence of conducted government-level  exercises that demonstrate national cyber  defense readiness;  B. Evidence of conducted national-level  exercises involving affected commercial  entities that demonstrate national cyber  defense readiness;  C. Evidence of conducted exercises with  international partners (e.g. NATO mutual  defense or APCERT Drill) that demon- strate cooperation through information  exchange and assistance;  D. The establishment of standards for re- sponsible state behavior in cyberspace  and identification of thresholds that per- mit engagement for cyber defense; and  E. The establishment of rapid assistance  mechanisms (separable from CERTs or  equivalents) for the government or spe- cific industries in case of major cyber  incidents.  Initial findings in this essential element are  based upon a review of whether a country has  officially declared to establish defense forces  whose top-level mission includes cyber de- fense of the nation. The CRI 2.0 draws on pri- mary and secondary sources to determine the  level of operational maturity. Updates to this  essential element will monitor, track, and eval- uate substantive and notable developments.  CONCLUSION  No country is cyber ready.  The threats to our networked systems and  infrastructures are real and growing and im- pose costs in economic terms to countries and  society. Economic and national security agen- das must align to bring transparency to cyber  insecurity. Showing this vital association may  spark national and global interest in address- ing this economic erosion. The CRI 2.0’s com- prehensive, comparative, experience-based  methodology provides a blueprint to evaluate  any country’s maturity and commitment to se- curing their national cyber infrastructure and  services upon which their digital future and  growth depend.  The CRI 2.0 blueprint identifies over seventy  unique data indicators across seven essential  elements: national strategy, incident response,  e-crime and law enforcement, information  sharing, investment in R&D, diplomacy and  trade, and defense and crisis response. These  indicators and essential elements provide a  framework for a country to develop a stronger  erosion.The  ©  2015 Cyber Readiness Index 2.0, all rights reserved.  32  security posture that can defend against GDP  erosion. In effect, the CRI 2.0 challenges the  conventional wisdom that cyber security is pre- dominately a national security issue. The CRI  2.0 can demonstrate how national security is  closely intertwined with Internet connectivity  and rapid adoption of ICT which, when secure,  can lead to economic growth and prosperity.  Instead of simply studying the problem, the  CRI 2.0 offers a framework for a country to  evaluate the strength of its ability to prevent  economic erosion from cyber insecurity. The  CRI 2.0 will be updated periodically adding  evaluation criteria without losing comparative  validity with any prior assessments. In that way,  the CRI 2.0 will demonstrate countries’ prog- ress and evolution toward securing the cyber  infrastructure and services upon which their  digital future and growth depend.  No country can afford cyber insecurity and the  losses it incurs. The CRI 2.0 data and method- ology can help national leaders chart a path to  a safer, more resilient economy in a deeply cy- bered, competitive, and conflict-prone world.

The Cyber Readiness Index 2.0 builds  on the previous Cyber Readiness Index  1.0, which provided a methodological  framework for assessing cyber read- iness across five essential elements,  namely: cyber national strategy, incident  response, e-crime and legal capacity,  information sharing, and cyber research  and development. The Cyber Readiness  Index 1.0 applied this methodology to  an initial set of thirty-five countries.

The latter is fully technolog- ical and could, in principle, be conducted  entirely within a network. It is normally  a component of the former. “Cybered  conflicts are those nationally significant  aggressive and disruptive conflicts for  which seminal events determining the  outcome could not have occurred with- out ‘cyber’ (meaning networked technol- ogies) mechanisms at critical junctures in  the determining course of events.” Chris  Demchak, “Resilience, Disruption, and a  ‘Cyber Westphalia’: Options for National  Security in a Cybered Conflict World,”  in Securing Cyberspace: A New Domain  for National Security, edited by Nicholas  Burns and Jonathon Price, (Washing- ton, DC: The Aspen Institute, 2012).  91.

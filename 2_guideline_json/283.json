Many  may attribute that market size to large organizations and multi-national companies. While these  are important contributors to the overall EU economy, the Small Medium Enterprise (SME)  businesses form the backbone of the EU’s economy.  According to the European Commission  “Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are the backbone of the EU's economy. They  represent 99% of all businesses in the EU and employ around 100 million people. They also  account for more than half of Europe’s GDP and play a key role in adding value in all sectors of  the EU economy2.” They serve both as enablers for the digital transformation, and as a core  element of the EU social fabric.  In response to the COVID19 pandemic, ENISA analysed the ability of SMEs within the EU to  cope with the cybersecurity challenges posed by the pandemic and determining good practices  to address those challenges. This report provides cybersecurity advice, but also proposals for  actions that Member States should consider in order to support SMEs improve their  cybersecurity posture.  The COVID19 crisis showed how important the Internet and computers in general are for SMEs  to maintain their business. In order to survive the pandemic and to continue in business many  SMEs had to take business continuity measures such as adopting to cloud services, upgrading  their internet services, improving their websites, and enabling staff to work remotely. This report  highlights how many of the existing cybersecurity challenges were exasperated further by the  impact of the COVID19 pandemic and are now more critical to mitigate. Our recommendations  outlined in this report to enable SMEs to address these cybersecurity challenges are shaped  towards this direction. The recommendations in this report was developed based on extended  desktop research. This research was augmented by a two-month-long survey, where 249  European SMEs shared their feedback on their state of digital security and preparedness for  crises such as COVID-19, and targeted interviews with selected participants followed. The  research identified that the greatest challenges for SMEs are low awareness of the threats  posed to their business by poor cybersecurity, the costs of implementing  cybersecurity  measures often combined with a lack of dedicated budget, the availability of ICT cybersecurity  specialists, a lack of suitable guidelines aimed at the SME sector, and low management  support.  In summary, SMEs within the European Union appear to understand that cybersecurity is an  important issue and that they are very reliant on their ICT infrastructure.  Of the SMEs surveyed over 80% stated that cybersecurity issues would have serious negative  impact on their business within a week of the issues happening, out of 57% saying they would  most likely become bankrupt or go out of business. Despite this, SMEs do not seem to  appreciate that cybersecurity is not something that impacts only larger organisations. Thus,  SMEs need to realise the impact cybersecurity issues can have on their business. Many SMEs  believe that cybersecurity controls that are included in the IT products they have purchased will  1 https://ec.europa.eu/trade/policy/eu-position-in-world-trade/  2 https://ec.europa.eu/growth/smes_en  25M  SMEs exist in  Europe.

Our recommendations towards SMEs are three-fold:   people,   processes and   technical.  They include keeping software up to date, applying strict access control rules, making use of  cloud services, having a plan for cyber-incidents and many others. For a full list of  recommendations, see Chapter 5. The report also includes recommendations for national and  European authorities.  The report is accompanied by a guide3, providing SMEs with practical 12 high level steps on  how to better secure SMEs' systems and their business.  3 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/cybersecurity-guide-for-smes  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/cybersecurity-guide-for-smes  CYBERSECURITY FOR SMES  June 2021  5  TABLE OF CONTENTS  1.

INTRODUCTION  Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are the backbone of the EU's economy. They  represent 99% of all businesses in the EU and employ around 100 million people4. There were  slightly more than 25 million SMEs in the EU-28 in 2018. They also account for more than half  of Europe’s GDP and play a key role in adding value in all sectors of the EU economy. They  serve both as enablers for the digital transformation, and as a core element of the EU social  fabric.  Since the early spring of 2020, quarantine measures to prevent the spread of the COVID-19  virus were imposed on more than 3.9 billion people worldwide. This unprecedented situation  affected education, work, commercial and social life.  Figure 1: New implemented technologies to avoid contact due to COVID19  Many companies urged employees to work remotely using online collaboration platforms,  e-commerce, e-banking, and e-government services were enhanced, education activities shifted  to e-learning and their use became part of many citizens' reality. In addition, traditional business  had to implement changes to avoid contact or crowded places, and implemented technologies  such as QR codes, contactless payments, and direct-to-consumer models such as home  delivery, click and collect services and remote assistance via chat or phone.  The recent crisis also showed how important the digitisation of processes is for maintaining  business operations. The promotion and implementation of digitisation in all sectors, not only in  e-commerce, is accelerating and expanding. SMEs have to take business continuity measures,  and improve online processes and related infrastructure to ensure their secure functioning.  They also have the opportunity to join forces within their sectoral associations, and cooperate  with partners and collaborators to guarantee the cybersecurity of their sectors.  Criminals are taking advantage of the fear and uncertainty that many citizens are experiencing  because of the pandemic. We are witnesses to a marked increase in malicious emails, phishing  attacks, scams and malware related to the COVID-19 crisis, In addition there is an increase in  the number of cyberattacks targeting specific industries already under strain, such as hospitals,  healthcare providers, and medical research facilities. Criminals are also targeting SMEs as they  are aware many SMEs now have staff working remotely, have deployed systems quickly rather  than securely in order to continue to serve their customers, and many do not have adequate  cybersecurity defences in place.  4 https://ec.europa.eu/growth/smes/sme-definition_en  CYBERSECURITY FOR SMES  June 2021  8  It is important that Europe’s small and medium businesses understand their cybersecurity risks,  and what they can do to protect themselves, their customers and their suppliers.  Contrary to the common perception that cyber-attacks occur only against large organizations, all  organizations can be similarly attacked, no matter what their size. Criminals often target SMEs  for various reasons such as they offer a good value to risk ratio and as many SMEs provide  services to larger organizations they can enable criminals attack those larger organizations  through their supply chain.  Despite the measures an organization can implement to protect proactively itself against cyber  related risks, there is no guarantee that it will not experience a cybersecurity related incident.  Therefore, an SME should develop plans and capabilities to recover as quickly as possible and  maintain business continuity after a cyber-related disruption.  Research and real-life practice demonstrates that organizations, who have prepared plans and  capabilities to deal with a cybersecurity related incidents deal with such incidents in a much  better and more efficient way than organizations that have no preparations in place. While often  in reality, the impact of a cybersecurity incident never fully reflects the planning carried out, the  preparations in creating those plans create a mind-set of awareness and improve team  cooperation in a crisis. As an old military saying goes - plans are useless but planning is  indispensable. The way that an organization will respond to a cybersecurity incident, will  determine the chances of recovering from the incident successfully. In today’s world,  organizations will not be judged by the fact they suffered a cybersecurity breach, but they will be  judged by how well they handle and respond to the breach.  While it is important for SMEs to have these preparations in place, it is important to remember  that these preparations need to be adapted to the specific circumstances of each SME, such as  their internal capabilities, as well as their legal, regulatory, and contractual requirements.  Effective cybersecurity provide SMEs with the confidence that allows them in an online and  interconnected world to grow, innovate, and find new ways of creating value for their customers.  The advice and guidance in this report provides simple measures that, if implemented, can  significantly help to avoid or mitigate the impact of a cybersecurity incident affecting an SME.  The language is clear, the actions are simple, and the guidance is tailored to small and  medium/sized businesses.  1.1 SCOPE / OBJECTIVES  In the current situation of the COVID19 pandemic, ENISA intends to analyse the ability of EU  SMEs to cope with cybersecurity issues in a crisis by identifying cybersecurity challenges and  determining good practices.  Taking note of the challenges and the good practices, this report provides cybersecurity advice  for SMEs to successfully cope with cybersecurity challenges, but also proposals for actions  towards Member States to support SMEs improve their cybersecurity posture.  1.2 TARGET AUDIENCE  The report intends to deliver actionable guidance to the owners and employees of SMEs. In  addition, this work can be of use to other entities involved in the SME ecosystem, such as SMEs  national and European associations, policy makers and implementers, SME ICT providers and  others.  1.3 METHODOLOGY OVERVIEW  The methodology followed to collect and assess the information for this study included;  CYBERSECURITY FOR SMES  June 2021  9   conducting desktop research,   carrying out an online survey aimed at SMEs,   running interviews with some of the survey respondents   interviewing industry experts.  The information derived from each stage of the process, was used to prepare and further  customize the next stage.  In the end, the collected information was analysed, cross-referenced and concentrated in order  to provide tangible results in line with the purpose of this study. The report was validated with  the survey participants, ENISA subject matter experts, the National Cybersecurity Security  Strategies Group, and the National Liaison Officers network.  For the detailed report methodology, consult Annex A.3 Methodology.  1.4 SME CHARACTERISTICS  Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) represent 99% of all businesses in the EU. There  were slightly more than 25 million SMEs in the EU-28 in 2018, of which 93% were micro SMEs  Based on the EU definition5.  The main factors determining whether an enterprise is an SME are  staff headcount combined with either turnover or balance sheet total (Table 1).  Figure 2: SMEs characteristics  According to the latest (November 2019) ANNUAL REPORT ON EUROPEAN SMEs  2018/20196 of the European Commission micro SMEs are by far the most common type of  SME, accounting for 93.0% of all enterprises and 93.2% of all SMEs in the Non-Financial  Business Sector (NFBS). However, micro SMEs accounted for only 29.7% of total employment  in the NFBS, while small and medium-sized SMEs accounted respectively for 20.1% and 16.8%  of total NFBS employment.

KEY SURVEY FINDINGS  2.1 SURVEY DEMOGRAPHICS  In total, 249 SMEs from 25 European Member States of the European participated in our online  survey, with the following characteristics:  Figure 3: Types of SMEs that answered the survey  The participants belonged to all sectors of the economy from accommodation to manufacturing  (for industry sections see Annex, Table A.1.).  More than 30% of the participants use ICT as a primary or secondary activity within their  business and more than 20% of the participants carried out professional, scientific and technical  activities as a primary or secondary activity.  The countries involved were Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, Czech Republic,  Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Lithuania, Luxembourg,  Malta, The Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovak Republic, Slovenia, Spain, and  Sweden.  CYBERSECURITY FOR SMES  June 2021  11  2.2 SURVEY CONCLUSIONS  From the participants’ responses some general conclusions can be drawn, regarding the role of  ICT and the cybersecurity posture of SMEs:  1. There is an increasing dependency on computers and the internet for all types of  SMEs.  Figure 4: Increased dependency on information services  Figure 5: Cybersecurity a key concern for the majority of businesses  CYBERSECURITY FOR SMES  June 2021  12  2. The majority of SMEs (>80%) process critical information, making cybersecurity  a key concern.  The term critical information as defined in the survey refers to information that if it is  stolen or lost, the organization would face serious legal repercussions and the owners  of the personal information could encounter significant or even irreversible  consequences (e.g. misappropriation of funds, blacklisting by financial institutions,  property damage, loss of employment, subpoena, worsening of health, inability to  work, long-term psychological or physical ailments,).  Figure 6: Criticality and sensitivity of processed information as perceived by SMEs  3. The majority of SMEs use some basic security controls such as endpoint antivirus  protection, backups, firewalls and perform systematic software updates. At the same  time fewer SMEs perform security awareness trainings of staff and utilise logging and  alerting systems.  Figure 7: Technological and Organizational Controls used by SMEs  CYBERSECURITY FOR SMES  June 2021  13  4. SMEs utilise the cloud for various information services and remote access tools  of various types, functionalities and security levels.  5. 25 % of participants who used some type of remote access before the COVID-19  pandemic, during the pandemic resorted to cloud services that allow, as a  minimum, access to and processing of e-mails, file processing and  communication  Figure 8: Use of Cloud  Figure 9: Use of Remote Access  6. Phishing, Malware and web-based attacks are the most common causes of  security incidents experienced by the survey participants.  Figure 10: Distribution of Cybersecurity Incidents based on their origin  The survey showed that 45% of SMEs who responded to the survey implemented new  technologies in response to the pandemic. The majority of these initiatives were to facilitate  remote working for staff such as remote access or moving to the cloud.  However, many of  these SMEs (over 90%) did not implement any new security measures, or any additional  security measures, to ensure the security of these solutions. It is also notable that while 36% of  the total respondents reported that they had experienced an incident within the last 5 years, 8%  of the same respondents suffered a cybersecurity incident since the start of the COVID-19  crisis; which, in terms of time, indicates a large increase of incidents during the short time frame  since the start of the COVID-19 period and when the survey was conducted.  In summary, SMEs appear to implement some of the basic cybersecurity measures only as part  of their overall IT implementation. However, it appears that unless cybersecurity controls are  included as part of an IT solution, many SMEs do not realize the potential resultant risks posed  to their business.  CYBERSECURITY FOR SMES  June 2021  14  3. CHALLENGES  Contrary to a concept that cyber-attacks occur only to large organizations, all enterprises can be  attacked regardless of their size and stored information.  Figure 11: Cybersecurity breaches and attacks in the last 12 months  Based on UK Cybersecurity Breaches Survey7 “almost half of businesses (46%) and a  quarter of charities (26%) report having cybersecurity breaches or attacks in the last 12  months. Like previous years, this is higher among medium businesses (68%), large  businesses (75%) and high-income charities (57%)”.  Our findings indicate that the challenges faced by SMEs regarding their cybersecurity  preparedness are many and of different nature. The common underlying issue to all appears  to be management awareness and commitment, which in turn drives budget, allocation of  resources and effective implementation of the cybersecurity practices. Seven categories of  major challenges for SMEs have been identified:   low cybersecurity awareness of the personnel,   inadequate protection of critical and sensitive information,   lack of budget,   lack of ICT cybersecurity specialists,   lack of suitable cybersecurity guidelines specific to SMEs,   shadow IT, i.e. shift of work in ICT environment out of SME’s control,   low management support.  Sixteen SMEs from 14 different countries (Austria, Estonia, Germany, Finland, France, Greece,  Ireland, Italy, Malta, Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Spain), were selected to  participate in semi-structured qualitative interviews through purposive sampling.  The following  7https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/893399/Cyber_Security _Breaches_Survey_2020_Statistical_Release_180620.pdf  https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/893399/Cyber_Security_Breaches_Survey_2020_Statistical_Release_180620.pdf https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/893399/Cyber_Security_Breaches_Survey_2020_Statistical_Release_180620.pdf  CYBERSECURITY FOR SMES  June 2021  15  subsections summarize the cybersecurity landscape from SMEs perspective, indicating, after  the data thematic analysis, their own perceptions regarding the main challenges.  3.1 LOW CYBERSECURITY AWARENESS  Because cybersecurity is a complex issue connected with technical solutions and measures, it  is often perceived that it only concerns IT related people. This, though, is not the case.  Cybersecurity should be part of the culture of the organization. Each person should have at  least basic awareness regarding cybersecurity and how their attitude can affect the  cybersecurity posture of the entire organization.  What is really needed is a transition from initial awareness to internal cybersecurity culture. For  example workers should know and understand how spear phishing and other social engineering  attacks work, rules of using their own devices to access company ICT environment, and other  basic cybersecurity precaution measures.  Figure 12: Top cyber-threat  According to the ENISA Threat Landscape 20208, 84% of cyberattacks rely on social  engineering. Furthermore, the number of phishing victims in the EU continues to grow with  malicious actors using the COVID-19 theme to lure them in. COVID-19-themed attacks  include messages carrying malicious file attachments and messages containing malicious  links that redirect users to phishing sites or malware downloads.  3.2 INADEQUATE PROTECTION FOR CRITICAL AND SENSITIVE  INFORMATION  SMEs handle a variety of information: personnel records, customer information, details about  production, procurement details, financial data, policies, procedures, and other. Each of them  has a different value to the organization and laws, regulations or agreements that may mandate  their protection.  Not having a specific backup up policy, an endpoint antimalware solution implemented on all  types of devices and kept up-to-date, using obsolete or just unpatched software that does not  auto update, could seriously jeopardize the company’s critical and sensitive information, making  the SME an easy target for cyberattacks like ransomware or other.  8 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/enisa-threat-landscape-2020-main-incidents  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/enisa-threat-landscape-2020-main-incidents  CYBERSECURITY FOR SMES  June 2021  16  Figure 13: Cybersecurity Threat Landscape  Based on ENISA’s Threat Landscape reports of 2020, Ransomware was the second  most common threat, and was related to one-third (28%) of security incidents.  In addition, according to the ENISA Threat Landscape Report 2018, weak or reused  passwords (56 %) and unlocked devices (44 %) are two of the biggest weaknesses within  organisations.  3.3 BUDGETARY ISSUES  Cybersecurity preparedness efforts entail investments from various aspects: such as awareness  training, implementation of cybersecurity controls, engaging external experts, and specialized  training for staff members dedicated to information security. Dedicated cybersecurity solutions,  as advanced firewalls or security information and event management systems (SIEM), are also  large investments.  While many SMEs have engaged with the cloud under subscription model, due to their size  many SMEs often do not qualify for special offers and have to deal with fixed cybersecurity SLA  contract clauses, unable to reach the SLA flexibility dedicated to large organizations. Advanced  solutions offering great variety of abilities and possible customizations useful for more  cybersecurity-mature organizations, are often not used by SMEs due to SMEs not being aware  of understanding the solutions offered. In many cases, the cybersecurity features are often part  of high-level subscription plans which may not be suitable to an SME.  This trend is evident from our study, which highlighted that while many SMEs engaged with new  solutions in reaction to the COVID19 pandemic many of them did not invest in any additional  security controls  While not specific to the cybersecurity challenges posed by the COVID19 pandemic, it is evident  that many SMEs view cybersecurity as a cost rather than as an investment in their business.  This is in spite of how many SMEs admitted that a major cybersecurity incident resulting in their  ICT systems being unavailable would have a major negative impact on their business. It is  therefore critical that SMEs understand better the risks to their business posed by cybersecurity  issues and subsequently allocate appropriate budgets to invest in the required controls to  protect their business.  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/ransomware https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/enisa-threat-landscape-report-2018  CYBERSECURITY FOR SMES  June 2021  17  Figure 14: Cybersecurity VS Costs  In our study, the interviewees noted that implementation cost is a major challenge. They  indicated that “the VPNs are costly and cumbersome”, “the antivirus and other software  security measures are expensive” and “security comes on an additional cost”.  3.4 LACK OF ICT CYBERSECURITY EXPERTISE & PERSONNEL  Cybersecurity is a specialized topic, requiring specialized knowledge, however it is quite  common within an SME that individuals multitask and may have multiple roles assigned to them.  As a result, an employee within a SME may be responsible for cybersecurity, as well as for  other processes.  While there are several cybersecurity related standards that SMEs could implement to improve  their cybersecurity readiness, such as the ISO 27001:2013 Information Security Standard9 and  the Federal Office for Information Security (BSI) IT-Grundschutz10, the implementation of these  standards can be a time-consuming process.  Compounding the challenges in this area is that many cybersecurity solutions require  specialized IT knowledge to implement and manage them properly. All of these issues  combined make managing cybersecurity within a SME a big challenge.  As an SME’s business grows and changes, the technology they employ will change and the  cyber threat landscape will constantly alter, which requires SMEs to ensure their efforts to  manage cybersecurity should be continuous and consistent. If the company does not directly  employ a person with specialized ICT knowledge (typical for non-technical SMEs), there is need  to invest in external expert assistance.  Cybersecurity vendors should also be required to ensure their products are secure by default  and that managing these products should be relatively straightforward for non-technical people.  Simple to follow standards and guidelines aimed specifically at the SME sector should be  developed within each Member State, such as the Cyber Essentials scheme11 within the UK  and the “12 Steps to Cybersecurity Guide”12 published by the Irish Government.  9 https://www.iso.org/isoiec-27001-information-security.html  10 https://www.bsi.bund.de/EN/Topics/ITGrundschutz/itgrundschutz_node.html  1111 https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/cyberessentials/overview  12 https://www.ncsc.gov.ie/pdfs/Cybersecurity_12_steps.pdf  https://www.iso.org/isoiec-27001-information-security.html https://www.bsi.bund.de/EN/Topics/ITGrundschutz/itgrundschutz_node.html https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/cyberessentials/overview https://www.ncsc.gov.ie/pdfs/Cybersecurity_12_steps.pdf  CYBERSECURITY FOR SMES  June 2021  18  The interview participants highlighted this challenge by saying that “dealing with security  threats is hard for non-IT related SMEs”, and that “there is a shortage of skills in the  population regarding cybersecurity”.  In addition, they mentioned that “usually SMEs do not have a CISO”. This is further  substantiated by the results of the online survey where only 28% of the participants (almost  half of them in the ICT industry) declared that they have assigned the role of the  Information Security Officer to someone within their organization.  3.5 LACK OF SUITABLE GUIDELINES  Another challenge for SMEs is the availability and suitability of guidelines in the form of  standards, whitepapers or other. There are existing documents13, however most of them, either  provide generic information, such as  “implement backup”, or address larger organizations with  an existing cybersecurity framework where more specialization is possible, for example “appoint  an information security officer and make sure that segregation of duties is applied”.  In addition, some of the well-known standards e.g. ISO 27001:201314 describe an approach for  the design, implementation, operation, control and improvement of an Information Security  Management System, which for many SMEs require external expert assistance to understand  and implement.  While several EU bodies and Member States have issued guidelines in relation to cybersecurity  the respondents highlight that many were not aware these were available, that some of them  were outdated, and that a lot of the material is written to highlight the theory behind  cybersecurity without providing practical guidelines.  The following table outlines some guidelines that are available both at the EU level and at the  national level. However, there is a lack of consistency on these guidelines across all Member  States and not all Member States provide guidelines in their own national language(s)  13 https://ccb.belgium.be/en/document/guide-sme  14  https://www.iso.org/standard/54534.html  https://ccb.belgium.be/en/document/guide-sme https://www.iso.org/standard/54534.html  CYBERSECURITY FOR SMES  June 2021  19  Table 1: Available guidelines at EU and National level  Level Organization Guideline  European  ENISA  Tips for Cybersecurity when buying online15  Information Security and Privacy Standards for SMEs16  Europol Safe Teleworking Tips and Advice17  CyberWatching.EU Cybersecurity Self-Assessment for SMEs18  Belgium  Cybersecurity Coalition Cybersecurity Guide for SME19  Centre for Cybersecurity Belgium Cybersecurity Guide for SME20  Finland  Finnish Transport and  Communications Agency National  Cybersecurity Centre  Information security under exceptional circumstances -  Instructions for organizations and companies21.

The participants confirmed that this is a major issue. They noted that “a generic certification  scheme does not help”, and that the “guidelines from governments and policy makers are  too abstract”.  Towards this, “missing guidelines about applying security and privacy legislation” was  another perception according to the respondents. Additionally, an interesting statement  concerned that “each enterprise has different context and needs, generic guidelines should  be extracted in the sense that the companies will be able to apply them”.  3.6 SHADOW IT/PERSONAL DEVICES  Many SMEs have allowed their staff to use their own personal devices to access company data.  This was a common practice before the COVID19 pandemic but was accelerated even more as  a result of the pandemic. In response to the demand for remote working when the COVID19  pandemic struck, many SMEs did not have the budget, resources, or indeed the time to  purchase and configure corporate devices for each of their remote workers. As a result, many  SMEs allowed their staff to use their own personal devices such as computers, tablets, and  smartphones to access company systems and data.  In addition, to staff using their own personal devices for business purposes they are also  accessing the internet, and therefore corporate systems and data, from their own home  networks. In many cases, these home networks are using consumer grade technology for items  such as broadband connectivity and wireless networks, which may not be as secure as the  business level technology employed by the SME in its own network. Compounding the use of  these potentially less secure home networks is the issue that these home networks are also  shared with others within the house. The devices others in the household use could pose an  additional security threat to the SME’s systems as they may not be configured in a secure  manner.  In effect, the COVID19 Pandemic has extended the SME’s network perimeter from the  locations associated with the SME’s business premises, to the homes of all its employees.  The use of personal devices is not the only concern with remote working, the use of personal  cloud services poses another risk that SME’s need to be aware of.  Staff, in an effort to be  productive and to enable sharing of company data, may use their own personal cloud services  for email or for sharing files. This is further exasperated if the SME does not have the facilities  set up to enable remote workers to collaborate effectively. Many SMEs may have employed a  Virtual Private Network (VPN) to allow remote access to its network and data, however these  VPNs may not be suitable or designed to support all of the SME’s staff access remotely. This  can then result in staff becoming frustrated with the technology in place and in an effort to get  their work done may employ their own personal cloud and email services.  3.7 MOVING ONLINE  Many SMEs surveyed had a relatively small online presence prior to the COVID19 Pandemic.  This typically consisted of a website providing details about their business. Many SMEs did not  use the Internet for online selling or direct engagement with their clients. However, with the  various lockdowns introduced by many Member States to counter the spread of COVID19 and  the resulting hesitancy of consumers to shop and engage in a face to face setting, many SMEs  faced the challenge on how to continue providing services to their clients without interacting with  them physically. This drove a large number of SMEs to convert all or parts of their business to  be delivered over the Internet. Businesses such as shops, restaurants, and craft businesses  rushed to set up an online presence from which they could promote and sell their products.  CYBERSECURITY FOR SMES  June 2021  22  Figure 15: Increase selling online  In Ireland, the annual report from the national registry for .ie domain names, showed a 25%  increase in the number of SMEs selling their products online of via an online store. In  addition, the same report highlights that 55% of Irish SMEs have invested in their online  presence since the beginning of the pandemic, up from just 21% in 2020.54  However, in the rush to get online and enable their businesses to survive many SMEs have not  invested either time or money in ensuring these online services are secure. Features such as  Multi-Factor Authentication to access sensitive systems such as email, ensuring websites are  regularly patched, and other security configurations were not configured by default. As a result,  many SMEs are now at risk of these services becoming compromised.  3.8 LOW MANAGEMENT SUPPORT  A key success factor for any business initiative within a company, no matter its size, is having  senior management support for that initiative. It is well known that without management support  any initiative will flounder and eventually fail. This is particularly true with cybersecurity as it can  be very hard to convince management to invest time, resources and money into something that  is hard to demonstrate brings direct value to the business. While in larger organizations senior  management can rely on their own cybersecurity experts or bring that expertise into the  organization using consultants, many SMEs do not have this luxury. Instead, senior  management within an SME often rely on their own knowledge of issues or what they learn from  their peer networks. As such, there is low awareness amongst SMEs that they face many  cybersecurity threats with many of them thinking they “are too small for criminals to want to hack  them.”  Contrary to a concept that cyber-attacks occur only to large organizations, all enterprises can be  similarly attacked, regardless of their size and stored information. SMEs are an interesting  target for cyber-attacks, because criminals may consider them to be easy targets due to SMEs  not having robust cybersecurity measures in place. In addition, as many SMEs provide services  to larger organizations an SME could be of interest to cybercriminals as a way to attack the  supply chain of this larger organization.  Management leadership and support can be demonstrated by providing specific objectives  regarding cybersecurity, provision of resources (human or others), the support for cybersecurity  policies, procedures and controls, and the establishment of risk appetite in relation to  cybersecurity – level of risk that an organization is ready to accept, before action is deemed  necessary to reduce, avoid or share (transfer) it.  54 https://www.weare.ie/tipping-point/  https://www.weare.ie/tipping-point/  CYBERSECURITY FOR SMES  June 2021  23  Figure 16: Increased management responsibility  The importance of management leadership is highlighted also by the SMEs as “it is the  task of the manager to continue to motivate and monitor the people. The manager should  make the employee understand what the value of security is and to make sure that they  continue to uphold the measures.”  CYBERSECURITY FOR SMES  June 2021  24  4. CYBERSECURITY INCIDENTS  Many SMEs falsely think that because of their small size they are of no interest to  cybercriminals. There is an assumption that cybercriminals prefer to target larger organizations  as those organizations have items that are of more interest to criminals, such as large amounts  of financial details belonging to customers or sensitive and valuable intellectual property.  However, criminals do not target only large organizations and will attack any company no matter  its size. They often prefer to attack smaller firms as there is a higher likelihood of these  companies not having sophisticated cybersecurity measures in place and therefore easier for  criminals to compromise.  The following are real life incidents that occurred against SMEs within the EU since the start of  the pandemic and highlight that criminals have no hesitation in taking advantage of poor  cybersecurity no matter how big or small the organization is.  Note to preserve the anonymity of the victims we have removed as much identifying information  as possible.  4.1 IT SERVICE PROVIDER COMPANY RANSOMWARED   Company Type : IT Software Service Provider   Company Size : < 50 employees   Breach Type : Ransomware attack  An IT service company provides updates of its software to its clients using 15 servers hosted in  a datacenter. Normally access to these servers was only allowed from the company’s own office  network, where its development team was based. As a result, of the pandemic all of the  company’s staff were moved to working from home. To facilitate remote working for its  developers the company enabled the developers to access the 15 servers in its datacenter via  the Microsoft Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP). However, the company did not secure their RDP  connections and criminals were able to breach their systems resulting in 14 of the 15 servers  becoming victims of a ransomware attack.  The company was lucky that the remaining server,  which had not yet been encrypted stored the backups of all the other servers, so they were able  to quickly restore services and then secured their RDP connections.  Lessons learnt:   If using RDP for remote access ensure it is secured55   Backups are an effective method to recover from a ransomware attack. Ensure that  you carry out regular backups and that they are stored offline so that criminals cannot  encrypt the backups.   Provide security awareness training to staff on selecting secure passwords  55https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2020/04/16/security-guidance-remote-desktop-adoption/  https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2020/04/16/security-guidance-remote-desktop-adoption/  CYBERSECURITY FOR SMES  June 2021  25  4.2 STOLEN LAPTOP   Company Type : Legal Firm   Company Size : <25 employees   Breach Type : Laptop stolen containing sensitive client data  A legal firm in response to the pandemic allowed its staff to work from home. However, not all  staff had company issued laptops and would use traditional desktop computers when in the  company’s office. To facilitate working from home the legal firm allowed staff to use their own  personal laptops. One member of staff was the victim of a burglary in their own, which resulted  in their personal laptop being stolen. The member of staff had been using this laptop for working  remotely and had copied all the clients’ information and emails onto the hard drive of their  laptop. The laptop was not encrypted therefore the data held on it is easily accessible to anyone  who gets access to the laptop  Lessons Learnt   Restrict staff to accessing only data they need access to in order to do their job   Ensure all portable devices are encrypted   Provide security awareness to staff on the risks of portable devices and how to protect  them  4.3 EMAIL ACCOUNT HIJACKED TO FACILITATE FRAUD   Company Type : Marketing and branding company   Company Size : <25 employees   Breach Type : Email account hijacked  A marketing and branding company moved their email system to a cloud based solution to  facilitate their staff to work remotely during the pandemic. One member of staff fell victim to a  phishing attack, which pretended to be from the email provider looking for account verification  details. Once the member of the staff entered their details, the criminals took over their email  account. The criminals then sent emails from that hijacked account to clients of the marketing  and branding company. These emails were a mixture of phishing emails and invoice redirection  fraud emails. The invoice redirection fraud emails were sent to some clients telling them the  banking details for the marketing and branding company had changed and that all future  payments for invoices should be sent to that new bank account (which was controlled by the  criminals). The phishing emails targeted clients of the marketing and branding company and  contained a link purporting to be a link to an outstanding invoice. When a client clicked on the  link it would ask the client for their user details and password.  The attack was detected by one of the marketing and branding firm’s customers, when a  member of that company’s staff clicked on the link within the phishing email and noticed the site  was a phishing site. The firm that notified the marketing and branding firm of the attack  subsequently cancelled all future business to the value of €200,000 to €300,000 annually over  concerns about cybersecurity.  Lessons Learnt   Enable Multi-Factor Authentication on hosted platforms   Provide security awareness training to staff to enable them identify phishing emails   Implement strong password policies for hosted platforms  CYBERSECURITY FOR SMES  June 2021  26  4.4 RANSOMWARED PC & SERVER   Company Type : Leisure/Sports Club   Company Size : <75 employees   Breach Type : Ransomware Attack  A leisure/sports club closed its onsite business at the start of the pandemic but allowed staff to  work remotely. To facilitate remote working the IT provider for the club installed remote desktop  sharing software on each of the employee’s company PC. This allowed each member of staff to  remotely connect to their office PC from home and work on their office PC as if they were  physically at the PC.  One member of staff received an email with an attachment in the email. The subject line was “Is  this your photo?” Upon opening the attachment, the ransomware installed on the computer  encrypting all files on that computer and on the file shares, it was accessing from the company’s  file server. This resulted in all the shared data in the company becoming encrypted.  The IT company were able to retrieve their data by using the Europol CyberCrime Centre’s  (EC3) NoMoreRansom website56 which provided them with the keys to decrypt the data.  Further investigations revealed that the PC that became infected did not have an up to date  anti-virus software installed, nor was the latest software patches and updates applied. This was  due to no-one being in the office to check and ensure the patches and updates had been  applied.  Lessons Learnt   Ensure all software on all PCs is patched and up to date.   Ensure anti-virus software on all PCs is up to date   Implement spam and virus filtering on incoming emails to block emails detected to  contain malicious content   Have secure, reliable, and up to date backups stored offline   Provide security awareness training to staff to enable them identify malicious emails   Implement tools to alert if software is not patched and updated on PCs   Implement tools to alert if anti-virus software is not up to date   Ensure alerting mechanisms are in place to warn of ongoing attacks, such as a  computer virus infection  4.5 CEO FRAUD   Company Type : Technology Company   Company Size : <75 employees   Breach Type : CEO Fraud  A technology company that specializes in website development became the victim of CEO fraud  resulting from a member of staff acting upon a fraudulent email they thought came from their  CEO. The company have moved all staff to remote working but as their email server was still on  their premises with poor broadband connectivity, staff were also using their own personal email  accounts to communicate with each other. A member of the finance team received what they  56 https://www.nomoreransom.org/  https://www.nomoreransom.org/  CYBERSECURITY FOR SMES  June 2021  27  thought was an email from the CEO asking for urgent payment to be made to a new supplier in  order to meet a project deadline. The email was not from the CEO but was crafted to look like it  came from them.  The member of staff only discovered the issue the next day when talking to  the CEO by phone and informed them the payment had been made.  Lessons Learnt   Ensure all staff, especially those in privileged role such as finance, follow written  processes and procedures.   Ensure management will not discipline staff for when they do follow proper processes  and procedures   Provide company systems for staff to communicate securely  CYBERSECURITY FOR SMES  June 2021  28  5. RECOMMENDATIONS  Our survey demonstrated that many SMEs had already some common cybersecurity measures  before the COVID19 Pandemic struck. However, the majority of these controls were basic  technical controls, such as firewalls and anti-virus software, and were the responsibility of the IT  person.  There are several publications issued by member states and other countries such as the United  Kingdom, Australia, and the United States that offer guidelines and recommendations to SMEs  on how to improve their cybersecurity.  Cybersecurity does not necessarily have to be costly for SMEs to implement and maintain.  Several measures can be implemented, without the company having to invest a large amount.  Many of these measures are focused primarily on ensuring roles, responsibilities are assigned  to the appropriate personnel, and that staff are aware of cybersecurity risks and how to identify  and protect against them. Many of the technical cybersecurity measures are also relatively cost  effective to implement and need not be necessarily overly sophisticated or complex.  The core cybersecurity fundamentals outlined in the above publications, and identified from our  survey and research, can be summarized in the following areas:  Figure 17: Core cybersecurity fundamental areas  As in any other areas of business, a checklist is an excellent method to ensure you are covering  the key areas in addressing the business issues and risks raised by cybersecurity. An  incomplete or negative response to any of the following items means that area of risk needs to  be addressed.

CYBERSECURITY FOR SMES  June 2021  30  5.1 PEOPLE RECOMMENDATIONS  5.1.1 Responsibility  Cybersecurity is clearly a key element in the ongoing success of any  SME, in particular during the COVID19 pandemic, and it is only  appropriate that responsibility for this critical function is assigned to  someone within the organization.  This role needs not necessarily be a  new job posting as the responsibilities for cybersecurity could be  integrated with the responsibilities of an existing role.  However, it is vital  that if integrating these responsibilities with another role that the  appropriate resources, training and time are given to the person  responsible for cybersecurity. Alternatively, this role could be outsourced  to a third party provider specializing in the area of cybersecurity.  The role of cybersecurity point of contact (or manager, depending on your SME’s naming  conventions) will:   act as a cybersecurity go-to contact, both internally and externally,   implement management directions into real life practice,   measure and report the SME’s performance against the declared security  objectives,   monitor the SME for further security gaps and proactively provide executive staff  with proposals for improvement.  In addition, if the SME has no data protection officer (DPO), he or she will also usually act as  contact for privacy issues.  Technology  Check Item Description  Answer  Network  Security  Are external connections, such as to the Internet, authorised by senior management,  properly documented and secured using Firewalls?  Anti-Virus Are all computer systems protected with the most up to date anti-virus software?  Are  users educated on how to identify and deal with suspect emails or files that may  contain computer viruses?  Encryption Do all devices storing data have full disk encryption enforced? Do you user Virtual  Private Networks (VPNS) when communicating over the Internet on public networks?  Security  Monitoring  Are the log files of important security devices actively monitored to detect potential  security breaches?  Physical  security  Are critical IT resources, such as file servers, secured in a secured area that is  protected from unauthorised access?  Are home office measures in place ensuring secured areas comparable to the office  (closed doors when leaving the workplace, no third party access to information via  windows or else)?  Secure  Backups  A good backup may save your business from a ransomware attack. Do you regularly  backup critical data and systems to secure offline storage? Do you regularly test  restoring from your backups to verify you can fully recover your data and systems?  CYBERSECURITY FOR SMES  June 2021  31  5.1.1.1 Management Commitment  Another critical success factor in effective cybersecurity is the commitment and the leadership  exhibited by management. Without effective support from management, many initiatives within a  business will fail. This applies to all aspects of the business but in particular to cybersecurity.  Cybersecurity demands resources such as time from personnel, the purchasing of cybersecurity  software, services, and hardware, training for staff, and the development of effective policies.  Management need to ensure those resources are available in a timely manner to ensure all  cyber related threats and risks to the business are appropriately managed.  Management should actively support cybersecurity efforts by giving them priority as far as  allocation of resources and budget is concerned. A key way to demonstrate leadership in this  area is for management to be very visible in their own participation in security awareness  training, ensuring that they comply with the company’s own cybersecurity policies, and that they  actively encourage staff to participate in trainings, support the decisions, policies and  procedures and provide a vision regarding cybersecurity.  Finally, management within SMEs should ensure that cybersecurity is a standing item on the  agenda for company management meetings; this is to guarantee that cybersecurity is regularly  discussed at the highest level within the company and is not something that is thought of only  when there is a problem.  5.1.2 Employee Buy-in  Just as important as having responsibility for cybersecurity assigned to an  appropriate person and to have commitment from the SME’s  management to cybersecurity is ensuring employees buy in to having  effective cybersecurity in place. It is essential that employees understand  the importance that good cybersecurity is in protecting the organization,  protecting the personal data entrusted by customers to that organization,  and ultimately in protecting the employees’ jobs.  Gaining employee buy-in for cybersecurity is critical and can only be got through effective  communication on cybersecurity from management, by management openly supporting  cybersecurity initiatives, appropriate trainings delivered to employees, and providing employees  with clear and specific rules outlined in cybersecurity policies.  Every SME employee should have the answers to these questions:   Am I allowed to access the company network and systems from a home  computer? Can I access work email using my private smartphone? If so, what are  the requirements?   What is the process I need to follow when a supplier sends a request asking for  their payment details to be changed?   What should I do after receiving a phishing email?   Am I allowed to use software that is not approved by my IT on my work computer?   What is the approved method for me to share company data with others,  especially those outside the company? Is there an approved file sharing platform  that I can use?   How can I access work email when accessing it over public Wi-Fi such as a hotel,  airport, or indeed my home wireless network?   How do I ensure my passwords are secure?  CYBERSECURITY FOR SMES  June 2021  32  5.1.3 Employee Awareness  While technical controls can minimize the risks posed by various threats,  the human factor is one that needs to be constantly managed. If staff are  not made aware of cybersecurity threats, the reasons the SME has  employed certain cybersecurity policies and controls, or how employees  should react to a suspect security breach, then the risk of a security  breach occurring increases significantly.  SMEs should provide regular cybersecurity awareness for employees to ensure they can  recognize and appropriately deal with the various cybersecurity treats that face SMEs.  The security awareness program should be tailored for the audience and should focus on topics  relevant to the audience’s role. For example, the content of the training for people working in  finance may be different for those working within the sales and marketing function.  Records of the training courses and those who attended should be maintained to ensure staff  members have received the correct training.  Although financial and personal resources of small businesses may be limited, cybersecurity  training does not necessarily mean hiring a specialized lecturer. There are great education  sources on-line, and every SME will surely find one suitable to their needs. Basic tips include:   Cover the main areas: how to recognize a phishing e-mail or an e-mail with a malicious  link or attachment; why an unknown USB drive should not be plugged into any  computer connected to the enterprise network; and why pirate software should not be  installed.   Do not forget to include basic physical security measures, like never leaving your  laptop unattended, or locking devices when not in use.   Consider testing your employees, and if you decide to do so, openly communicate it.  After cyber awareness training, test them with a simulated phishing email of your own  making. If they fail, do not „name & shame“, but educate further.   Collect feedback on the training process and act accordingly, further customizing it to  your needs.  The purpose of these training activities is not to make every staff member a cybersecurity  expert, but rather to provide a basic understanding of the actual and practical cyber related  risks, what the impact to the organization may be, and how their behavior can affect the  outcome. Training should be practical and periodical, tailored to SME’s special conditions and  needs.  5.1.4 Cybersecurity Training  Many SMEs may have responsibility for managing and looking after  their IT systems assigned to someone who may not be formally trained  in cybersecurity. This may be someone internal to the SME or it could  even be an outsourced IT provider, who has competence in IT but not  necessarily in cybersecurity.  Staff responsible for cybersecurity who are not appropriately trained or experienced in the area  may cause issues due to errors caused by lack of knowledge or experience. They may even not  configure a system or device to be secured appropriately.  SMEs should ensure there is a formal cybersecurity training program, with the appropriate  budgeting and resources, for those responsible for managing cybersecurity within the business.  CYBERSECURITY FOR SMES  June 2021  33  Thus, they will have the skills and competencies required to ensure the security, availability, and  ongoing operations of the IT infrastructure within the organization.  Should the SME have their IT and cybersecurity managed and supported by an external third  party then the SME should engage with their provider to determine what level of competencies  that provider had in cybersecurity and what plans do they have in place to ensure they have the  appropriate level of competencies for cybersecurity in place.  5.1.5 Cybersecurity Policies  SMEs should set up clear and specific rules outlined in cybersecurity  policies for its employees on how they are expected to behave when  using the company’s ICT environment, equipment, and services. These  policies should also highlight the consequences an employee could face  should they not adhere to the policies. The SME should ensure these  policies are regularly reviewed, updated, communicated to employees,  and that employees understand those policies,  Every SME employee should have the answers to these questions:   Am I allowed to access the company network and systems from a home  computer? Can I access work email using my private smartphone? If so, what are  the requirements?   What is the process I need to follow when a supplier sends a request asking for  their payment details to be changed?   What should I do after receiving a phishing email?   Am I allowed to use software that is not approved by my IT on my work computer?   What is the approved method for me to share company data with others,  especially those outside the company? Is there an approved file sharing platform  that I can use?   How can I access work email when accessing it over public Wi-Fi such as a hotel,  airport, or indeed my home wireless network?   How do I ensure my passwords are secure?  The ideal policies should be short, succinct, with specific guidelines for employees to follow, and  should be written in easy to understand language.  5.1.6 Third Party Management  Like all organizations, SMEs rely on other organizations to provide them  with services. Some of these services may involve outsourcing of key  business functions to a third party. Indeed, it is not uncommon for SMEs  to outsource the management and support of their IT systems to another  firm specializing in IT.  However, many of the arrangements in place with third parties, particularly concerning  cybersecurity, are informal and may not have appropriate confidentiality clauses within the  contract for service. SMEs should ensure that all vendors, particularly those with access to  sensitive data and/or systems, should be actively managed to ensure they meet agreed service  level commitments. Contractual agreements should regulate how the information will be  accessed during the provision of said service and how will it be treated, as well as penalties,  billing, guarantees and other aspects.  CYBERSECURITY FOR SMES  June 2021  34  To ensure the security of services provided by Third Party vendors or outsourced partners,  SMEs should:   Develop a list of minimum cybersecurity requirements and obligations that vendors  and suppliers must have in place in order for the SME to engage with them   Regularly review and conduct an inventory of all its vendors and suppliers.   Appoint someone with the responsibility to manage these relationships   Ensure Service Level Agreements are in place with each key supplier and that these  are managed and monitored on an ongoing basis.  The above Service Level Agreements should clearly;  o state the scope of the service being provided,  o outline the roles and responsibilities for each party,  o define clear lines of demarcation,  o demonstrate the agreed cybersecurity level of the provided services,  o detail how to report problems and associated escalation procedures,  o include metrics by which the services are measured.   Conduct regular reviews with suppliers, especially those managing data and/or  services on behalf of the SME to ensure the security measures they implement are  appropriate.   Develop a process to manage the end of a service, either expected or unexpected,  with a supplier. This process should ensure that any sensitive data that the vendor  had access to are either securely destroyed or returned to the SME.   Include a Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA) or a confidentiality clause detailing what  data is considered confidential, how long this confidentiality relationship will last,  restrictions on the use of information by the service provider and the legal jurisdiction  accepted.  If the external vendor provider requires access to any personal data under the care of the SME,  a Data Processing Agreement should be put in place as per the requirements outlined in the EU  General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).  5.2 PROCESS RECOMMENDATIONS  5.2.1 Cybersecurity Audits  Without regular cybersecurity audits, or assessments, it is possible that  issues will develop and go undetected by SMEs. Regular audits can  help ensure any issues are identified and remedied before a breach.  Regular cybersecurity audits also ensures an SME can have confidence  that discipline and that its cybersecurity framework is being maintained.  These audits can include assessments on the effectiveness of the  cybersecurity policies that are in place. They can also test the technical  controls to ensure the SME’s firewalls, website, and other critical  systems do not have any weaknesses that could allow an attacker to  gain access.  CYBERSECURITY FOR SMES  June 2021  35  Those with the appropriate knowledge, skills, and experience to conduct effective audits should  carry out regular audits. These people could be internal to the SME. Ideally, they should be  conducted by a party that is independent from the daily operations of the IT systems within the  SME.  5.2.2 Incident Planning and Response  In today’s environment, it is often not a question if a company will suffer a  cybersecurity breach but more likely when will it suffer one. While in the  past companies may have been judged for suffering a breach, today it is  accepted that cybersecurity breaches do occur and that those  organizations that suffer a breach are a victim of a crime. As such, many  will not negatively judge an organization should it fall victim to a crime but  they will judge the organization on how it responds to the incident.  Therefore it is important for SMEs to accept that at some stage they may suffer a cybersecurity  breach and it is important to have a formalized incident response plan in place, as without such  a plan the response to a cybersecurity incident will most likely be ad hoc and unplanned which  often results in;   Disclosure of confidential information.   Prolonged recovery times.   Lack of evidence for a criminal or civil case.   Negative impact to the organisation’s image.   Potential legal and/or compliance Issues.   Potential Legal Cases from Third Party Organisations.   Exposure to Legal/Libel Cases from Employees/Individuals.  SMEs should develop a formal incident response plan, which contains clear guidelines, roles  and responsibilities to ensure that all security incidents are in a professional and appropriate  manner.  This policy should include details of how electronic evidence should be preserved, gathered and  handled and each responsibilities.  Standard Operating Procedures to respond to incidents of different types should also be  developed to include;   The actions to be taken if multiple machines are infected with a computer virus.   Under what conditions, and whose authority, network segments are shut down.   Under what conditions, and whose authority, internet connectivity is disabled.   How computer virus infections are identified and removed.   Who liaises with the press, key stakeholders and public in the event of a serious  incident?   How to liaise with clients and partners, law enforcement, the Data Protection Supervisory  Authority, or other regulators?  CYBERSECURITY FOR SMES  June 2021  36  5.2.3 Passwords  One of the key layers of protection against unauthorized access to a  company’s data is the implementation of a suitable access control  procedure. An SME should ensure its computer network could support  the ability to centrally implement access control such as those provided  by modern network systems like Microsoft Active Directory, or the  Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP).  This will enable the SME to ensure those accessing its systems and data can be centrally  managed and controlled. The ENISA Tips for secure authentication is an excellent resource that  SMEs can refer to to help them address this challenge  When dealing with credentials and more specifically passwords, SMEs should ensure that  employees:   use strong passwords or passphrases which should be long, with lower-and upper-case  characters, possibly also numbers and special characters.  It is preferable that employees use a passphrase – a collection of random common  words combined into a phrase that provide a very good combination of memorability  and security. For example, three random words like:  ‘’ogre swingy glamor’’  present a very strong password and if it can be sprinkled with uppercase characters or  numbers, it’s even stronger. Many national authorities, like UK National Cybersecurity  Centre, also vet the passphrase approach57.  The French Commission Nationale de l'Informatique et des Libertés  (CNIL, National Commission on Informatics and Liberty)  recommends to  organizations that process personal data and employ authentication based  only on an identifier (e.g. username) and a password, that \"password  should have a minimum of 12 characters, and .. must include upper-case  letters, lower-case letters, numbers, and special characters.\"58  Whatever approach you choose, stay away from the obvious, like using word  “password”, sequences of letters like “abc”, sequences of numbers like “123”, keyboard  paths like “qwerty” on English language keyboards, and your real life data like date of  birth or name of your high school. In password creation, randomness is your friend.   do not reuse their work passwords elsewhere   do not attach Post-it notes detailing passwords to their screens or leave passwords  otherwise accessible in written form (they should be encouraged to use a password  manager instead),   We recommend the use of a dedicated password manager (usually superior in features  to the browsers in-built password managers), as they help to keep strong, unique  passwords.  57 https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/blog-post/three-random-words-or-thinkrandom-0  58 https://www.cnil.fr/sites/default/files/atoms/files/recommandation_passwords_en.pdf  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/news/enisa-news/tips-for-secure-user-authentication https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/blog-post/three-random-words-or-thinkrandom-0  CYBERSECURITY FOR SMES  June 2021  37   do not to share their passwords with colleagues (nor user accounts)   Where possible, enforce Multi-Factor Authentication.  Figure 18: Multi-factor authentication technologies  Many services now provide Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)59, which is an additional  step outside of entering a password to verify that the person trying to access the  system is indeed who they claim to be. This often is done by either sending a text  message to a known number for the account holder, using an app that supports  authentication, or by using physical tokens, which must be present at the time of  accessing the account.  Once an employee leaves that organization, the SME should also ensure that they revoke the  employee’s access to business systems if they leave the business.  Master passwords may be stored as part of SME’s contingency planning or to provide backup if  some of the administrators is unavailable. However, they need to be stored in a safe place and  accessible only to authorized personnel.  Figure 19: Overview of weak password issues  According to the ENISA Threat Landscape Report 2018, weak or reused passwords  (56%) and unlocked devices (44%) represent two of the highest risks.  An incident connected with the malfunction of passwords, is one experienced by  Twitter. Specifically, a glitch in the password handling procedure potentially  exposed all users’ passwords in plain text before completing the hashing process.  (ca. 330 million)60.  59 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/csirts-in-europe/glossary/authentication-methods  60 https://www.bbc.com/news/business-43995168  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/enisa-threat-landscape-report-2018 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/csirts-in-europe/glossary/authentication-methods https://www.bbc.com/news/business-43995168  CYBERSECURITY FOR SMES  June 2021  38  5.2.4 Software Patches  Software updates fix known security vulnerabilities, and may improve  the functionality and performance of your program or device. SMEs  need to be prepared to upgrade their systems on a regular basis due to  software and hardware becoming out of date. An SME’s IT infrastructure  should be treated the same way as any other business infrastructure  and modernised on a regular basis;   Update all of their software.   Set up a systematic procedure to keep it that way.   Turn on automatic updates whenever possible.   Identify software and hardware that requires manual updates   Take into account mobile and IoT devices.  SMEs should look at implementing solutions that allows them to centrally manage and control  how and when software patches are applied. This will also enable the SME to have visibility as  to what devices may not have been successfully patched and may need additional attention to  remedy.  A well-known example of how a major security incident happened due to a vulnerability  being exploited before organizations were able to patch their systems was with the  “WannaCry”61 ransomware attack. It is estimated that 230,000 organizations in 150  countries fell victim to these attacks. The estimated losses were 4-8 Billion US $62.  WannaCry indiscriminately targeted vulnerable systems that ran specific versions of the  Windows operating systems with many SMEs falling victim.  5.2.5 Data Protection  Under the EU General Data Protection Regulation any SMEs that  process or store personal data belonging to those resident within the  EU/EEA are required to ensure that appropriate security controls are in  place to protect that data. This includes ensuring that any third parties  working on behalf of the SME have appropriate security measures in  place. The Irish Data Protection Commission provides a guide on the  security measures expected to be in place.63  5.3 TECHNICAL RECOMMENDATIONS  5.3.1 Network Security  According to the results of the online survey, a firewall solution has been  implemented by at least 86% of the participants even before the  COVID19 crisis. This percentage appears to have risen further (90%)  during the crisis.  61 https://www.europol.europa.eu/wannacry-ransomware  62 https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/security/news/vulnerabilities-and-exploits/cybercrime-and-exploits-attacks-on- unpatched-systems  63 https://dataprotection.ie/en/dpc-guidance/guidance-controllers-data-security  https://www.europol.europa.eu/wannacry-ransomware https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/security/news/vulnerabilities-and-exploits/cybercrime-and-exploits-attacks-on-unpatched-systems https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/security/news/vulnerabilities-and-exploits/cybercrime-and-exploits-attacks-on-unpatched-systems  CYBERSECURITY FOR SMES  June 2021  39  Firewalls filter and monitor the incoming and outgoing traffic on the perimeter of trusted and  untrusted networks based on given rules. The effective configuration of these rules is a key  success factor, and should be implemented and gradually tuned up with care. Firewalls may  also provide and manage remote access to the organization by supporting Virtual Private  Networks (VPNs).  When selecting a firewall an SME should also look to see, what additional security features are  provided, either by default or by paying extra fees. Some of these features could include filtering  email and web traffic for malicious software such as viruses, blocking access to known bad  sections of the Internet, and providing alerting and monitoring to potential attacks.  Given the important role firewalls play in protecting an SME’s internal network and systems,  SMEs should ensure they employ the most appropriate firewall for their needs. This may require  engaging with someone who has the relevant expertise that can recommend that most  appropriate solution.  5.3.2 Anti-Virus  Anti-virus software is one of the most commonly used cybersecurity tools for endpoint  protection. It protects against various kinds of malware, unauthorized malicious software  designed to cause harm. Malware can gain access to important information such as bank  credentials, credit card numbers or passwords. It can also take control or spy on a user’s  computer.  The majority (88%) of the survey participants already implemented some form of anti-virus  solution even before the COVID19 pandemic, and the number appears to have further risen  (>90%) during the COVID19 pandemic.  An anti-virus solution should be implemented on all types of devices and kept up-to-date in  order to ensure its continuous effectiveness. This includes employees’ tablets and smartphones  connected to the company network, be it in SME’s or their ownership. This anti-virus solution  should provide the SME with the ability to manage centrally the anti-virus software installed on  all devices within the organization and ensure that it is kept up to date. Should the anti-virus  software on any of the devices detect a potential infection, it should also alert the appropriate  personnel within the SME to deal with the situation.  5.3.3 Employ Email and Web Protection Tools  Email remains a major attack medium and a way to gain a foothold within  the systems of an organization. Malicious e-mails may come in the form  of e-mails with malicious attachments, e-mails containing links to  malware distribution sites, phishing e-mails, or scam e-mails tricking  SMEs into revealing their sensitive data or sending money.  Figure 20: 13% increase since 2019 in Windows malware detections  Despite the increased awareness and implementation of anti-  virus solutions, the ENISA Threat Landscape Report 2020  shows that there was a 13% increase since 2019 in Windows  malware detections at business endpoints globally and that  71% of organizations experienced malware activity that spread  from one employee’s computer to another. The report also  highlighted that malware attacks have grown in volume and in  sophistication.  CYBERSECURITY FOR SMES  June 2021  40  Phishing emails can be very sophisticated, leveraging social engineering practices – creating a  sense of urgency, and often mimicking phrasing, branding and logos of a well-known institution  (such as a bank or a business partner) or just a colleague. Phishing or fraudulent emails target  employees within an SME to trick them into giving away sensitive personal or enterprise  information, such as passwords or credit card numbers. One popular form of malicious emails  targeting SMEs are invoice redirect scams, where cybercriminals create a fake email to look like  it comes from known supplier requesting the account payment details for the supplier be  changed to one controlled by the criminals.  The fact that SME staff may have a low awareness regarding this type of malicious behavior  makes them ideal candidates for criminals to exploit. In tandem with cyber awareness trainings,  SMEs should implement rules that will not allow change of payment details or transfer of funds  based on an email only. Such an important step should also be confirmed using a different  communication channel (in person, by phone, using live videoconference etc.) to prevent cyber  criminals from taking advantage.  The overwhelming amount of news coverage surrounding the novel coronavirus has also  created a new danger — phishing scams looking to exploit public fears about the sometimes-  deadly virus. These fraudulent emails assert to be sent from the World Health Organization or  the US Centre for Disease Control or a renowned specialist offering information or help  regarding COVID-19. You can find ENISA’s advice that is more detailed on how to protect  against phishing attacks in an article on phishing during the COVID-19 pandemic64.  Employees at SME should also know basic web browsing security practices, like how to spot  fraudulent pages and stay clear from installing suspicious browser plug-ins.  In order for organizations to be better prepared against these types of attacks, it is necessary to  combine solutions that will filter out the possible spam emails, email containing link to a  malicious website, emails containing a malicious attachment (i.e. containing a malware  payload), or phishing attempts with relevant and practical training of the organization’s staff.  5.3.4 Encryption  Encryption is information that is scrambled in such a way that only those  with the appropriate access can unscramble that data to read it.  Encryption therefore provides strong protection for sensitive data.  Where  possible SMEs should use encryption to protect data when it is being  stored or being transferred over public networks such as the Internet.  Due to their portable nature, mobile devices, such as laptops and smartphones, are more likely  to be lost or stolen. While the cost of the mobile device itself may not be high the value of the  data held on the device could be quite high. Many modern operating systems have encryption  features built into them, which SMEs should enable to ensure the data stored on mobile devices  are encrypted.  For data that is transferred over public networks, such as hotel or airport Wi-Fi networks, or over  the Internet, SMEs should ensure that data is encrypted, by either employing a Virtual Private  Network (VPN) from a trusted provider or accessing websites over secure connections using  SSL/TLS protocol.  64 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/news/enisa-news/understanding-and-dealing-with-phishing-during-the-covid-19-pandemic  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/news/enisa-news/understanding-and-dealing-with-phishing-during-the-covid-19-pandemic https://www.enisa.europa.eu/news/enisa-news/understanding-and-dealing-with-phishing-during-the-covid-19-pandemic  CYBERSECURITY FOR SMES  June 2021  41  Similarly, for their own websites, especially if that site is being used to support online  transactions, SMEs should ensure they are employing suitable encryption technology to protect  client data as it travels between the SME’s server and the clients’ devices.  5.3.5 Security Monitoring  Many of the systems and devices which SMEs employ, such as servers,  firewalls, and anti-virus software, can log and record system activity to  support troubleshooting and maintenance. In many cases, this also  includes recording any suspicious activity that could be related to a  potential security breach. However, by default there is often no facility to  generate alerts, which often results in breaches occurring without the  victim organizations being aware.  So while SMEs may have the data to alert them to suspicious activity on their systems or  breaches that data is not being actively monitored to alert the SME to these incidents. This is  similar to having a burglar alarm installed on the premises but not turning it on. SMEs should  investigate tools that could monitor and create alerts when suspicious activity or security  breaches are occurring.  5.3.6 Physical Security  Physical security is an important aspect of an overall cybersecurity  program. Sensitive data can be stored in electronic format and in  physical format such as on paper. If there is no appropriate physical  security to protect the data, then criminals can quickly undermine the  cybersecurity controls that may be in place.  It is therefore important to  ensure appropriate physical controls are employed where important  information resides.  A company laptop or a smartphone, for instance, should not be left unattended in the back seat  of a car, and the same principle applies for information on USB drives or prints on a sheet of  paper. To prevent unauthorized access, anytime a user walks away from their computer, be it  on the company premises or elsewhere, they should lock it. Setting auto-lock function, using full  disk encryption and if possible purchasing laptops with TPM chips are a number of measures  that could reinforce physical security. Sensitive printed documents should also not be left  unattended and when not in use securely stored away.  Figure 21: Result of the Hørsholm Municipality security breach  The Danish Data Protection Authority imposed a fine on the  Hørsholm Municipality resulting from a security breach that  happened when an employee had their municipality issued  laptop stolen from their car. On the stolen laptop was personal  data of approximately 1,600 employees at Hørsholm  Municipality, including information of a sensitive nature and  information about social security numbers.  5.3.7 Secure Backups  According to our online survey, more than 90% of the participants were  already taking some kind of backup even before the COVID19  pandemic. This percentage appears to have risen further (>94%) during  the COVID19 pandemic.  CYBERSECURITY FOR SMES  June 2021  42  Irrespective of the root cause, the company should be able to recover its information within a  desirable period. To enable the recovery of the information, backups should be kept, as  they are an effective way to recover for example from ransomware. The exact technology  employed (sophisticated dedicated software, simple scripts or manual backups) remains at the  choice of the organization. In every case, the following rules should apply:  Figure 22: Increase of back-up policies   backup is regular and automated whenever possible,   backup is held separately from the SME’s production environment, i.e. the network that  employees directly interact with,   backups are encrypted, especially if they are going to be moved between locations,   the ability to regularly restore data from the backups is tested. Ideally, a regular test of  a full restore from start to finish should be done.  To ensure an SME has an effective backup strategy the SME should consider employing the  common easy-to-remember so-called 3-2-1 rule approach to safeguard data against most failure  scenarios:  Figure 23: 3-2-1 rule to safeguard data  A retention period should be set and implemented based on the specific circumstances of the  organization. In other words, backup iterations should be set according to business reality of  each company, so the cost of lost data in a given timespan is acceptable. Backup practices  need to be tailored according to the SME infrastructure (on premise vs cloud).  Have at least one off-  site backup, outside of  the SME core ICT  environment, be it in a  remote location or cloud.  Store those copies on  two different storage  media to protect them  against different risks.  Keep three copies of  any important files.  CYBERSECURITY FOR SMES  June 2021  43  In 2017, GitLab experienced an incident, and had to go offline after suffering what appears to  be a major backup restoration failure after accidentally deleting production data. As mentioned  in the company’s blog “out of five backup/replication techniques deployed none are working  reliably or set up in the first place. We ended up restoring a six-hour-old backup” 65 (This  means that data created in the meantime between the last backup and the time of the incident  were lost).  5.4 COVID19 SPECIFIC RECOMMENDATIONS  As stated earlier in this document, many SMEs had to react quickly to the impact of the  COVID19 pandemic and the subsequent widespread lockdowns that many member states  implemented to protect the lives and health of citizens. However, this quick reaction to the  pandemic meant that most SMEs simply focused on keeping their business operating and took  what the necessary steps to ensure staff could work remotely and in some cases, SMEs  changed their business models to service their customers online rather than in traditional face-  to-face situations.  With this background in mind, it is not surprising that SMEs focused primarily on ensuring their  ICT environments operated in such a way to support the SMEs business goals.  Cybersecurity  may not have been a major factor in deciding how to meet those business goals. This focus on  keeping the business running is understandable. However, in the rush to achieve this goal key  cybersecurity measures may not be implemented properly or not implemented at all.  This section of the report will highlight several areas SMEs should examine to ensure the  security of their data, services, and systems.  5.4.1 Review Remote Access Facilities  In response to the pandemic many SMEs installed various ways to  enable staff to access remotely the SME’s network. This could be  installing or upgrading a Virtual Private Network (VPN) for the  organization, or installing remote desktop management tools, enabling  remote connecting protocols such as the Remote Desktop Protocol  (RDP), or by installing other remote access technologies.  SMEs should now review any remote access facilities to ensure they are secure. The following  are the key things SMEs should focus on;   Ensure all remote access software is patched and up date.   Implement a tool or a process to ensure that remote access software will continue to  be patched and kept up to date.   Review the remote access settings to restrict access from known or trusted locations,  such as restricting remote access to staff based in certain geographical locations or  accessing from certain IP addresses.   Restrict staff accessing systems remotely to only the systems and computers they  need access to.   Enforce strong passwords for remote access and where possible enable multi-factor  authentication.   Ensure monitoring and alerting is enabled to warn of suspected attacks or unusual  suspicious activity.  65 https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2017/02/01/gitlab-dot-com-database-incident/  https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2017/02/01/gitlab-dot-com-database-incident/  CYBERSECURITY FOR SMES  June 2021  44  5.4.2 Engage with the Cloud  Many Cloud Service Providers (CSPs) can offer services that will enable  SMEs continue to support their staff working remotely. These can range  from providing email platforms, file-sharing facilities, and video  conferencing, to online collaboration tools. In most cases, the CSP can  secure the services being provided to the SME much more effectively  and efficiently than the SME.  As mentioned earlier in the report SMEs should ensure they keep software installed on their  computer systems patched and up to date. They also need to ensure their anti-virus solution is  managed so that it is kept up data on all devices. Traditionally these two functions were often  managed using servers and software installed on the SME’s own network. However, with many  staff working remotely these solutions many not be as effective.  Moving to cloud based patch management and cloud based anti-virus platforms can provide the  SME with the capability to ensure that their IT infrastructure is being managed and secured.  While offering many advantages, cloud based solutions do provide some unique risks. SMEs  should consider them before engaging with a CSP. ENISA have published a “Cloud Security  Guide for SMEs”66 which SMEs should refer to when migrating to the cloud.  The following are some of the key items an SME should consider before engaging with a CSP;   Determine the physical location where the SME’s data will be stored. This is important  to ensure the SME does not breach any laws or regulations by storing data, especially  personal data, in CSPs located outside of the EU/EEA. For example, the EU GDPR  requires that personal data of residents within the EU/EEA is not stored or transmitted  outside of the EU/EEA unless under very specific conditions.   Implement Multifactor Authentication to ensure that cloud based accounts are at a  lesser risk of being hijacked by criminals. Without MFA implemented on CSP based  services the only protection for the accounts that access those CSP based services  are the passwords people employ on their accounts. If those passwords are weak,  have been reused from other websites, or the account holder falls victim to a phishing  attack, then that could result in a security breach. MFA provides an additional layer of  protection to help prevent this from happening.   Many cloud services are provided with built-in security features, however these are  often turned off by default. SMEs should make sure they understand what the security  features are in the service they are subscribing to and enable them. If the security  features at the current plan the SME is using are not adequate the CSP may offer the  required features at a different plan, which the SME could subscribe to.  66 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/cloud-security-guide-for-smes  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/cloud-security-guide-for-smes  CYBERSECURITY FOR SMES  June 2021  45  5.4.3 Implement Mobile Device Management  When facilitating staff to work remotely many SMEs allowed their staff to  use their own personal devices such as computers, laptops, tablet,  and/or smartphones. While this may have helped ensure the SME could  continue to provide services to its client, it also introduced several  security concerns about the SME’s data stored on those personal  devices. One way for an SME to manage this risk is to employ a Mobile  Device Management (MDM) solution. With a MDM solution a SME could   Control what devices are allowed to access its systems and services.   Ensure the device has up to date anti-virus software installed.   Determine if the device is encrypted.   Confirm if the device has up to date software patches installed.   Enforce the device is protected by a PIN and/or a password.   Remotely wipe any SME data from the device should the device owner report it lost or  stolen, or if the device owner’s employment was to end with the SME.  5.4.4 Conduct Appropriate Security Awareness Training  Criminals will take advantage of all situations if it results in them  achieving their goals. The COVID19 pandemic is a perfect scenario for  criminals to exploit as they can leverage of the fears and concerns that  people have regarding the pandemic. Criminals will look to compromise  accounts and systems using COVID19 themed phishing emails, or use  scam emails pretending to be from couriers to spread malicious  software.  In addition, many staff will now be working remotely from their own homes and may not be  working from a network or device as secure as that provided within the SME’s own office  environment.  With this in mind, it is important for SMEs to ensure staff are regularly updated on what the  latest cybersecurity themed threats are and how they should work securely while working  remotely.  The Irish Data Protection Commission have issued a guide, “Protecting Personal Data When  Working Remotely”67 for companies so they can ensure personal data entrusted ot them is  secured when staff are working remotely.  5.4.5 Secure Online Sites  Many SMEs moved from engaging directly with their customers in face  to face to dealing with them via online. SMEs rushed to set up new  websites so they could sell to their customers online. However, it is  essential that SMEs ensure that their online websites are configured  and maintained in a secure manner. Any personal data or financial  details, such as credit card data, must be appropriately protected. This  will entail running regular security tests against the websites to identify  any potential security weaknesses and conducting regular reviews to  ensure the site is maintained and updated properly.  67 https://dataprotection.ie/en/dpc-guidance/blogs/protecting-personal-data-when-working-remotely  https://dataprotection.ie/en/dpc-guidance/blogs/protecting-personal-data-when-working-remotely  CYBERSECURITY FOR SMES  June 2021  46  5.4.6 Information Sharing  An effective tool in the fight against cybercrime is the sharing of  information. Many firms are afraid of publicly discussing cybersecurity  issues, in particular details about breaches, as they fear negative  publicity resulting from their perceived weakness in relation to  cybersecurity. However, while this may be true in the past, this is no  longer the case as many firms realize that they cannot deal with this  issue by themselves.  The sharing of information in relation to cybercrime is key to SMEs to understand better the  risks they face. Firms that hear about cybersecurity challenges, and how those challenges were  overcome, from their peers will more likely take steps to secure their systems than if they were  to hear similar details from industry reports or from cybersecurity surveys.  A key element in facilitating information sharing is with ISACs, as outlined in our  recommendations at the EU and National level. However, until ISACs are in place SMEs can  use other mechanisms to share good practices for cybersecurity, alerting others to potential  attacks, or how to recover from a breach. Similar to neighborhood watch schemes in the real  world, information-sharing networks in relation to cybersecurity, can quickly improve security for  all. SMEs can look to existing bodies to facilitate this information sharing. Bodies such as  chambers of commerce, industry representative bodies, or local business associations all  provide a useful platform to facilities information sharing and education. These bodies could  also engage with cybersecurity experts to address their members at meetings or conferences to  ensure they are aware of the latest threats and the good practices that SMEs can employ.  CYBERSECURITY FOR SMES  June 2021  47  5.5 MAPPING THREATS TO RECOMMENDATIONS  The survey identified the typical cybersecurity issues experienced by SMEs. These are outlined  in Figure 6. The following table demonstrates how these cybersecurity issues can be managed  by the above recommendations;  Table 3: Mapping threats to recommendations  Issues Categories Recommendations  Phishing  People  Employee Buy-in  Employee Awareness  Cybersecurity Training  Cybersecurity Policies  Process  Incident Planning and Response  Passwords (implement Multi-Factor  Authentication)  Technical  Network Security  Security Monitoring  Web Based Attack  People  Cybersecurity Training  Cybersecurity Policies  Third Party Management  Process  Audits  Incident Planning and Response  Passwords  Software Patches  Data Protection  Technology  Network Security  Anti-Virus  Security Monitoring  Secure Backups  General Malware  People  Employee Buy-in  Employee Awareness  Cybersecurity Training  Cybersecurity Policies  Process  Audits  Incident Planning and Response  Passwords  Software Patches  Data Protection  Technology  Network Security  Anti-Virus  Encryption  Security Monitoring  Secure Backups  CYBERSECURITY FOR SMES  June 2021  48  Issues Categories Recommendations  Malicious Insider  People  Employee Buy-in  Employee Awareness  Cybersecurity Training  Cybersecurity Policies  Process  Audits  Incident Planning and Response  Passwords  Software Patches  Data Protection  Technology  Network Security  Anti-Virus  Encryption  Security Monitoring  Physical Security  Secure Backups  Denial of Service  People  Cybersecurity Training  Cybersecurity Policies  Third Party Management  Process  Audits  Incident Planning and Response  Passwords  Software Patches  Data Protection  Technology  Network Security  Anti-Virus  Security Monitoring  Secure Backups  Social Engineering  People  Employee Buy-in  Employee Awareness  Cybersecurity Training  Cybersecurity Policies  Process  Incident Planning and Response  Passwords (implement Multi-Factor  Authentication)  Technical  Network Security  Security Monitoring  Compromised/Stolen  Device  People  Employee Buy-in  Employee Awareness  Cybersecurity Training  Cybersecurity Policies  Process  Audits  Incident Planning and Response  Passwords  Data Protection  Technology  Encryption  Physical Security  CYBERSECURITY FOR SMES  June 2021  49  6. EU AND NATIONAL LEVEL  RECOMMENDATIONS  The following recommendations are directed towards Regional, National and European  Authorities with the purpose of assisting SMEs in adopting cybersecurity solutions.  It is important to outline that most SMEs who participated in the survey and the interviews  highlighted the lack of applicability and usefulness of the various measures, guidelines, and  approaches to dealing with cybersecurity that some Member State authorities have proposed to  SMEs for adoption.  This shortcoming of existing measures will hopefully be overcome, as this part of the study,  provides recommendations towards policy makers of all levels of government that have been  derived and validated by the affected parties (the SMEs).  6.1 PROMOTE CYBERSECURITY AT LARGE  Specific awareness raising campaigns on cybersecurity issues, which  educate SMEs owners, managers, employees and shareholders, should  be created by the relevant authorities and where possible in partnership  with business representative organizations. Such practices will help the  organizations to understand how they can protect their businesses and  which resources, such a guidelines, standards, and tools they could  possibly use. These campaigns should be orchestrated within Europe  but adjusting its pace and content to specific regional cases.  However, experience has shown that despite regular campaigns, many SMEs do not engage in  these campaigns or the campaigns do not effectively reach the target audience. As such, future  campaigns need to be more focused on the SME sector as a target. It is recommended, that  these campaigns should be run regularly and be customized depending on the topic being  promoted at the time. It is essential that the content is aimed at the needs of the intended  audiences, primarily SMEs, hence the need to partner with business representative  organizations who can highlight those needs to those designing the campaigns. The campaigns  should aim at helping SMEs to understand cybersecurity threats and how these threats can  affect people, in both their personal and professional lives. Finally, the methods of  implementation should be carefully selected, in particular as to how the campaigns are  delivered to the SMEs. It may require tailored content for each business sector with the  emphasis placed on the key issues affecting that business sector (for example, cybersecurity  issues relating to online shopping may not be relevant to business sectors that do not use the  Internet to sell their goods and services).  The effectiveness of these campaigns must be measured to ensure the key messages are  being delivered and that cybersecurity within SMEs is improving. This could be achieved by  conducting regular surveys similar to the one conducted to support this report, by gathering  feedback from SMEs after a campaign has been completed, and by analysis reports of  cybercrime incidents to law enforcement agencies, Computer Emergency Response Teams  (CERTs), and Data Protection Supervisory Authorities  CYBERSECURITY FOR SMES  June 2021  50  Note: This type of training is different from the one mentioned in section 5.1.3. The desired  results after the implementation of this recommendation is the increase in the awareness  regarding cybersecurity within the SME sector in general.  6.2 PROVIDE TARGETED GUIDELINES AND TEMPLATES  It has been pointed out from the contributions to the online survey and  the subsequent follow up interviews that there are many generically  written guides in relation to cybersecurity, such as cybersecurity  standards and relevant laws and regulations, which outline what should  be done. For example, the EU General Data Protection Regulation  states in Article 3268 that:  “Taking into account the state of the art, the costs of implementation  and the nature, scope, context and purposes of processing as well as  the risk of varying likelihood and severity for the rights and freedoms of  natural persons, the controller and the processor shall implement  appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of  security appropriate to the risk…”.  Although the meaning of this requirement is clear, the implementation path for an SME with  limited resources and knowledge on cybersecurity is anything but clear.  As most SMEs are not aware of either specific standards or methods and techniques for  implementing security and privacy measures, easy to use, clear and structured implementation  guidelines, plans, procedures, and exercises should be developed to assist SMEs bridge this  gap.  Good practices handbooks including realistic and specific examples, simple terms and easily  translatable language should be prepared. These guidelines and templates should be especially  adapted to the characteristics of SMEs and should be adaptable based on the criticality of  information processed by the SME, the industry and their dependence on ICT.  Public-private collaboration is proposed through collaboration with SME representative bodies,  appropriate public sector organizations, and, where there is no conflict of interest, cybersecurity  companies for the better definition and content of these guidelines, exercises, procedures,  handbooks and standards.  6.3 CREATE SME FOCUSED CYBERSECURITY STANDARDS  A standard is a document designed to be used as a rule, guideline or  definition. It is a consensus-built, repeatable way of doing something.  Standards are created by bringing together all interested parties such as  manufacturers, consumers and regulators of a particular material,  product, process or service69. However, SMEs often have a minority  contribution in these standardization efforts and the resulting work rarely  makes specific provisions for SMEs.  There are many existing standards for cybersecurity, which are not adopted by SMEs. There  are various reasons why this may be the case. Primarily due to the fact that cybersecurity  standards are suitable for larger organizations and not SMEs. However, this should not  68 https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2016/679/oj  69 https://www.cen.eu/work/ENdev/whatisEN/Pages/default.aspx  https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2016/679/oj https://www.cen.eu/work/ENdev/whatisEN/Pages/default.aspx  CYBERSECURITY FOR SMES  June 2021  51  necessarily be the case. SMEs should be encouraged to adopt cybersecurity standards.  Tailored guidance and implementation guides for SMEs on how to adopt these existing  cybersecurity standards should be created.  In addition, it is important that good practices and guidelines are created and published for  cybersecurity and that they are developed based on the needs of SMEs. Participation of SMEs  in all stages of the standards’ lifecycle must be ensured, from their participation in  standardization committees to the final standard use and adoption. Standards focused primarily  on SMEs, similar to the Cyber Essentials, should be considered.70  Furthermore, SMEs are reminded that adhering to cybersecurity standards, while it is a positive  measure in improving the cybersecurity for the organization, it is no guarantee that systems are  100% secure. Cybersecurity standards are a means to manage the risk related to cybersecurity  but do not eliminate that risk.  The Belgian guide for SMEs71 includes basic but also advanced measures to enable SMEs to  improve their cybersecurity levels, reduce cybersecurity risks, mitigate vulnerabilities and  improve their resilience.  6.4 BOLSTER USE OF RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORKS  Throughout this document, various risks related to cybersecurity have  been presented. Each organization (small or large) has to identify,  assess and evaluate these risks, decide on based on their business  requirements how they will manage those risks. This process is known  as Risk Management and presents a crucial decision making tool that  can be fitted to every organization including SMEs.  There is a huge variety of standards, tools, methodologies and techniques that could be used to  identify key cybersecurity risks. Many of these tools are outlined in the ENISA “Inventory of Risk  Management/Risk Assessment Methods & Tools72”.  However, in many cases there is a lack of  simplified and practical risk management solutions aimed at the SME sector.  Risk Management frameworks that are practical, easy to understand, easy to translate to  business terms, easy to implement without specialized knowledge, and scalable to SMEs need  to be designed and promoted. Similar to the Dutch VNO-NCW Cyber Risk guide for SMEs73.  Promoting the use of these risk frameworks and providing instructions on how to apply them  should be encouraged by Member States.  70 https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/cyberessentials/overview  71 https://ccb.belgium.be/en/document/guide-sme  72 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/threat-risk-management/risk-management/current-risk/risk-management-inventory  73 https://www.vno-ncw.nl/standpunten/cybersecurity  https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/cyberessentials/overview https://ccb.belgium.be/en/document/guide-sme https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/threat-risk-management/risk-management/current-risk/risk-management-inventory https://www.vno-ncw.nl/standpunten/cybersecurity  CYBERSECURITY FOR SMES  June 2021  52  EBIOS (Expression des Besoins et Identification des Objectifs de Sécurité - Expression of  Needs and Identification of Security Objectives) is a method for analysis, evaluation and action  on risks relating to information systems. It generates a security policy adapted to the needs of  an organization. The method was created in 1995 and is now maintained by the ANSSI, a  department of the French Prime Minister.  The IT baseline protection (German: IT-Grundschutz)74 approach from the German Federal  Office for Information Security (BSI) is a methodology to identify and implement computer  security measures in an organization. The aim is the achievement of an adequate and  appropriate level of security for IT systems. To reach this goal the BSI recommends \"well-  proven technical, organizational, personnel, and infrastructural safeguards\".  MONARC (Method for Optimised Analysis of Risk CASES) of the Ministry of Economy in  Luxembourg. The advantage of MONARC lies in the capitalisation of risk analysis already  performed in similar business contexts: the same vulnerabilities regularly appear in many  businesses, as they face the same threats and generate similar risks. Most companies have  servers, printers, a fleet of smartphones, Wi-Fi antennas, etc. Therefore, the vulnerabilities  and threats are the same. Thus. it is sufficient to generalise risk scenarios for these assets  (also called objects) by context and/or business.  6.5 MAKE CYBERSECURITY AFFORDABLE  As mentioned in the Challenges section, cybersecurity bears a cost for  organizations and in particular for SMEs who due to lack of  understanding or awareness may not budget appropriately for  cybersecurity solutions. These costs can relate to the purchasing of  cybersecurity products, services, external consulting service, and other  related costs. These costs may play the leading role in the decision  whether or not to implement cybersecurity measures and to which  extent.  The vast majority of the participants in this survey highlighted that they need help in this area. It  is recommended, that the relevant bodies in Member States consider assisting SMEs in this  area by implementing any of the following actions:   Improving access to competent cybersecurity advice or guidelines.   Providing funding for the strengthening of the SMEs cybersecurity posture.   Providing tools to lower the cybersecurity solutions price per SME (using more  effective procurement methods and systems, pooling demand75, etc.)  For example many SMEs (in particular the smaller ones) use cloud services, which are  managed by the provider under standard contract clauses and fixed Service Level Agreements  (SLAs). Individual SMEs due to their size have no advantage or ability to negotiate suitable  SLAs, something which larger organizations may be able to do so.  In larger numbers, SMEs  might develop customized SLAs or contract clauses to fit better their cybersecurity needs.  74 https://www.bsi.bund.de/DE/Themen/Unternehmen-und-Organisationen/Standards-und-Zertifizierung/IT-Grundschutz/it- grundschutz_node.html  75 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pooling_(resource_management)  https://www.ssi.gouv.fr/en/ https://www.bsi.bund.de/ https://www.bsi.bund.de/ https://www.bsi.bund.de/DE/Themen/Unternehmen-und-Organisationen/Standards-und-Zertifizierung/IT-Grundschutz/it-grundschutz_node.html https://www.bsi.bund.de/DE/Themen/Unternehmen-und-Organisationen/Standards-und-Zertifizierung/IT-Grundschutz/it-grundschutz_node.html https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pooling_(resource_management)  CYBERSECURITY FOR SMES  June 2021  53  6.6 PROMOTE THE CREATION OF ISACS  Information Sharing and Analysis Centers (ISACs)76 are important  instruments to ensure close cooperation between public and private  stakeholders within different business sectors. ISACs are non for profit  organizations set up within a business sector or focusing on a common  theme for various businesses to enable those businesses to share  experiences regarding cybersecurity. This could be advice on best  practises for those who are members of the ISAC on how to deal with  cybersecurity issues, providing warnings relating to cybersecurity issues  specific to the ISAC, and guidelines and best practises on how to  manage cybersecurity.  Participation of SMEs in ISACs could greatly enhance the SMEs cybersecurity posture,  particularly if the ISAC is aimed at the SME sector, or can facilitate the cybersecurity concerns  specific to SMEs. ENISA has done substantial work on the topic of ISACs to identify the  different ISAC models in Europe through the report on Cooperative Models on ISACs77.  Moreover, ENISA recently published the ISAC in a BOX78, an online toolkit created around a  lifecycle of building, running, evaluating and developing phases and each phase includes  information, activities, documents, tools for setting up and running an ISAC. There is also  available from ENISA the report on “Public Private Partnerships (PPP) - Cooperative models”79  which Member States can refer to when designing the appropriate ISACs.  76 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/national-cyber-security-strategies/information-sharing  77 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/information-sharing-and-analysis-center-isacs-cooperative-models  78 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/national-cyber-security-strategies/information-sharing/isacs-toolkit/view  79 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/public-private-partnerships-ppp-cooperative-models  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/national-cyber-security-strategies/information-sharing https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/information-sharing-and-analysis-center-isacs-cooperative-models https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/national-cyber-security-strategies/information-sharing/isacs-toolkit/view https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/public-private-partnerships-ppp-cooperative-models  CYBERSECURITY FOR SMES  June 2021  54  A  ANNEX: METHODOLOGY  A.1 SMES IN EU  According to the latest (November 2019) ANNUAL REPORT ON EUROPEAN SMEs 2018/2019  of the European Commission80:   There were slightly more than 25 million SMEs in the EU-28 in 2018, of which 93%  were micro SMEs. SMEs accounted for 99.8% of all enterprises in the EU-28  nonfinancial business sector (NFBS), generating 56.4% of NFBS value added and  66.6%of NFBS employment. Overall, the NFBS represented 54.5% of EU-28 GDP and  61.4% of total EU-28 employment.   Micro SMEs are by far the most common type of SME, accounting for 93.0% of all  enterprises and 93.2%6 of all SMEs in the NFBS. However, micro SMEs accounted for  only 29.7% of total employment in the NFBS, while small and medium-sized SMEs  accounted respectively for 20.1% and 16.8% of total NFBS employment.  To help in the extraction of information on cybersecurity in SMEs, a predefined set of industry  sectors was utilised. The industry sectors used were derived from the Annual Report on  European SMEs 2018/2019 and the NACE Rev. 2 statistical classification of economic activities  in the European Community81  Table A.1: Industry sections and descriptions  Industry section Brief Description  Accommodation  and food service  activities  This section includes the provision of short-stay accommodation for visitors  and other travellers and the provision of complete meals and drinks fit for  immediate consumption. The amount and type of supplementary services  provided within this section can vary widely.  This section excludes the provision of long-term accommodation as primary  residences, which is classified in real estate activities. Also excluded is the  preparation of food or drinks that are either not fit for immediate consumption  or that are sold through independent distribution channels, i.e. through  wholesale or retail trade activities. The preparation of these foods is classified  in manufacturing.  Administrative and  support service  activities  This section includes a variety of activities that support general business  operations.  Examples of activities belonging to this section are: Rental and  leasing activities, Employment activities, Travel agency, tour operator and  other reservation service and related activities, Security and investigation  activities, Services to buildings and landscape activities and Office  administrative, office support and other business support activities.

The dimension of the network is not decisive; also  included are the distribution of electricity, gas, steam, hot water and the like in  industrial parks or residential buildings.  This section therefore includes the operation of electric and gas utilities, which  generate, control and distribute electric power or gas.  Also included is the provision of steam and air-conditioning supply.  Information and  communication  This section includes the production and distribution of information and cultural  products, the provision of the means to transmit or distribute these products,  as well as data or communications, information technology activities and the  processing of data and other information service activities.  Manufacturing  This section includes the physical or chemical transformation of materials,  substances, or components into new products. The materials, substances, or  components transformed are raw materials that are products of agriculture,  forestry, fishing, mining or quarrying as well as products of other  manufacturing activities. Substantial alteration, renovation or reconstruction of  goods is generally considered to be manufacturing.  Mining and  quarrying  Mining and quarrying include the extraction of minerals occurring naturally as  solids (coal and ores), liquids (petroleum) or gases (natural gas). Extraction  can be achieved by different methods such as underground or surface mining,  well operation, seabed mining etc. This section includes supplementary  activities aimed at preparing the crude materials for marketing, for example,  crushing, grinding, cleaning, drying, sorting, concentrating ores, liquefaction of  natural gas and agglomeration of solid fuels.  These operations are often accomplished by the units that extracted the  resource and/or others located nearby.  Professional,  scientific and  technical activities  This section includes specialised professional, scientific and technical  activities. These activities require a high degree of training, and make  specialised knowledge and skills available to users. Activities contained within  this section are Legal and accounting activities, Activities of head offices;  management consultancy activities, Architectural and engineering activities;  technical testing and analysis, Scientific research and development,  Advertising and market research, Other professional, scientific and technical  activities.  Real estate  This section includes acting as lessors, agents and/or brokers in one or more  of the following: selling or buying real estate, renting real estate, providing  other real estate services such as appraising real estate or acting as real  estate escrow agents. Activities in this section may be carried out on own or  leased property and may be done on a fee or contract basis. Also included is  the building of structures, combined with maintaining ownership or leasing of  such structures.  Transportation and  storage  This section includes the provision of passenger or freight transport, whether  scheduled or not, by rail, pipeline, road, water or air and associated activities  such as terminal and parking facilities, cargo handling, storage etc. Included in  this section is the renting of transport equipment with driver or operator. Also  included are postal and courier activities.  Water supply,  sewerage, waste  management and  remediation  activities  This section includes activities related to the management (including collection,  treatment and disposal) of various forms of waste, such as solid or non-solid  industrial or household waste, as well as contaminated sites. The output of the  waste  or sewage treatment process can either be disposed of or become an input  into other production processes. Activities of water supply are also grouped in  this section, since they are often carried out in connection with, or by units also  engaged in, the treatment of sewage.  Wholesale and  retail trade, repair  of motor vehicles  and motorcycles  This section includes wholesale and retail sale (i.e. sale without  transformation) of any type of goods, and rendering services incidental to the  sale of merchandise. Wholesaling and retailing are the final steps in the  distribution of merchandise. Also included in this section are the repair of  motor vehicles and motorcycles  CYBERSECURITY FOR SMES  June 2021  56  A.2 METHODOLOGY  A.2.1 Phase I: Stock Taking  The first phase (Phase I), ‘stock-taking’, was gathering all the data that was to make up base for  the study and was divided in three main activities:   desktop research,   online survey and   interviews  Analysis of Phase I(a): Desktop Research  During the desktop research, more than 70 documents were analysed including high  reputational publications (i.e. technical reports, good practices and standards), other technical  documents, whitepapers, and reports previously published by ENISA which focused on SMEs.  Even before the pandemic crisis, there were a number of available recommendations regarding  the design and implementation of cybersecurity measures in organizations – some of them  focused on SMEs. During the desktop research, such publications were systematically sought,  identified, and analysed.  After the review of these publications, the project team was able to identify the documents that  provided insight into the challenges faced by SMEs in their cybersecurity endeavours and the  associated recommendations.  The results of the desktop review were consolidated, categorized, and a table was created  containing the categories of challenges and recommendations identified by each relevant  document. This table is not included in this report (because of size limitations), but was used in  two different ways within this study:   The most predominant results were simplified and were used in the construction of the  content of the online survey.   The quantified information was one of the influencing factors in the selection of the  recommendations presented in sections 4 and 5 of the report.  Note: The recommendations reviewed covered technical, organizational, and policy  recommendations, including recommendations towards relevant national and European  authorities.  CYBERSECURITY FOR SMES  June 2021  57  Analysis of Phase I(b): Survey  An online survey was conducted in the period between July and September 2020 in which 249  SMEs participated. In order to promote the survey and make sure that there was an adequate  degree of participation several different channels of communication were selected (the ENISA  website, social media, direct contacts with various stakeholders in various member states,  relevant European funded projects etc).  The results of the online survey are analysed in Sections 2, 3 and 4.  The online survey provided a lot of information regarding the challenges and the  recommendations for cybersecurity, but in order to achieve the objectives of this study, it was  critical to have access to the perceptive of the SMEs regarding their actual value and  practicality.  In order to collect these opinions, the structure of the survey was as follows:  Section A – Information regarding the participating organization  Purpose: Gather general (demographic) information regarding the SME in order to make sure  that they should be included in the survey (valid replies) and be able to extract some  conclusions based on industry, country, size etc.  Section B - The role of ICT  Purpose: Gather information on the technology knowledge and dependence of the organization  to computers and the internet as well as the perceived criticality and sensitivity of information  processed by the organization. These parameters together would show the impact of a possible  cybersecurity incident to the organization (in terms of operation and legal compliance).  Furthermore, information derived from this study would show whether there is a difference in the  cybersecurity posture of the SMEs based on the organization’s dependence to computers and  the internet and the criticality of the information processed.  Section C – Security measures implemented  Purpose: This section gathered information regarding the security technologies and controls  implemented before and after the COVID-19 pandemic. The results to these questions would  allow for conclusions regarding the security level of the SMEs before and after the COVID-19  pandemic.  The security technologies and controls examined are presented in the following Tables A.4 &  A.5.  CYBERSECURITY FOR SMES  June 2021  58  Table A.2: Security Technologies  Type Description  Firewall  A network security system that monitors and controls incoming and outgoing  network traffic based on predetermined security rules.

CYBERSECURITY FOR SMES  June 2021  60  Section D – Cybersecurity Incidents, challenges and proposals  Purpose: Within this section, information regarding cybersecurity incidents, challenges, and  recommendations were requested. An analysis of the answers regarding a cybersecurity  incident could provide conclusions regarding the rate of cybersecurity incidents in SMEs, the  origin of the cybersecurity incidents, the possible correlation between the cybersecurity  incidents, and the implemented measures, as well as the measures implemented after these  incidents. An analysis of the challenges faced and proposals for action would provide a gravity  factor, which, when correlated with the results of the desktop research, would enable a more  realistic set of recommendations to be provided for SMEs.  Section E – Further involvement  Purpose: The results of the online survey and the final results of this study were planned to be  further validated through various methods. In this section, the help of the participants was  solicited. The information of the participants would only be used only in this part of the study for  the development of recommendations for actions and in accordance to the ENISA privacy policy.  Analysis of Phase I(c): Interviews  After the publication of the survey, at specific checkpoints, the results of the online survey were  monitored and when the ¾ checkpoint was reached, the first preliminary analysis was  conducted. This analysis contained all information and correlations mentioned above and led to  the compilation of an initial set of cybersecurity challenges and recommendations by the SMEs.  To further validate these preliminary results, structured interviews were planned and conducted.  The participants in these interviews were selected from the volunteers of the online survey. The  interview participants were selected based on the industry, the country, and the type of SME,  they were involved in. To facilitate the interviews, a customized questionnaire was created. The  questions covered all the areas mentioned in the survey and focused on   Which were (if any) the changes regarding cybersecurity posture brought by the  pandemic.   Which are the challenges an SME is facing regarding cybersecurity.   Which recommendations towards European / Country / Regional government could  have value to the SMEs.   Which measures affecting the SMEs themselves could be practically applicable.  The results of the interviews were collected, analysed, consolidated, and correlated with those  collected through the desktop research and the online survey. The result is presented in  Sections 4 and 5.  A.2.2 Phase II: Extraction of Results  The second phase (Phase II) of the study was based on the qualitative analysis of the findings  and the development of recommendations in two discrete axes:   Cybersecurity recommendations for SMEs   Proposals for actions to Regional, National and European authorities, to support the  SMEs in strengthening their Cybersecurity posture.  A.2.3 Phase III: Report Validation  The draft version of this study was shared with an extended ecosystem of stakeholders in order  to validate the results. This ecosystem included representatives of the SMEs participating in  both the online survey and the interviews, the ENISA National Liaison Officers network, the  National Cybersecurity Strategies Group and ENISA subject matter experts. A final validation  stage was carried out by conducting a validation workshop organized by ENISA.

Many  may attribute that market size to large organizations and multi-national companies. While these  are important contributors to the overall EU economy, the Small Medium Enterprise (SME)  businesses form the backbone of the EU’s economy.  According to the European Commission  “Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are the backbone of the EU's economy. They  represent 99% of all businesses in the EU and employ around 100 million people. They also  account for more than half of Europe’s GDP and play a key role in adding value in all sectors of  the EU economy2.” They serve both as enablers for the digital transformation, and as a core  element of the EU social fabric.  In response to the COVID19 pandemic, ENISA analysed the ability of SMEs within the EU to  cope with the cybersecurity challenges posed by the pandemic and determining good practices  to address those challenges. This report provides cybersecurity advice, but also proposals for  actions that Member States should consider in order to support SMEs improve their  cybersecurity posture.  The COVID19 crisis showed how important the Internet and computers in general are for SMEs  to maintain their business. In order to survive the pandemic and to continue in business many  SMEs had to take business continuity measures such as adopting to cloud services, upgrading  their internet services, improving their websites, and enabling staff to work remotely. This report  highlights how many of the existing cybersecurity challenges were exasperated further by the  impact of the COVID19 pandemic and are now more critical to mitigate. Our recommendations  outlined in this report to enable SMEs to address these cybersecurity challenges are shaped  towards this direction. The recommendations in this report was developed based on extended  desktop research. This research was augmented by a two-month-long survey, where 249  European SMEs shared their feedback on their state of digital security and preparedness for  crises such as COVID-19, and targeted interviews with selected participants followed. The  research identified that the greatest challenges for SMEs are low awareness of the threats  posed to their business by poor cybersecurity, the costs of implementing  cybersecurity  measures often combined with a lack of dedicated budget, the availability of ICT cybersecurity  specialists, a lack of suitable guidelines aimed at the SME sector, and low management  support.  In summary, SMEs within the European Union appear to understand that cybersecurity is an  important issue and that they are very reliant on their ICT infrastructure.  Of the SMEs surveyed over 80% stated that cybersecurity issues would have serious negative  impact on their business within a week of the issues happening, out of 57% saying they would  most likely become bankrupt or go out of business. Despite this, SMEs do not seem to  appreciate that cybersecurity is not something that impacts only larger organisations. Thus,  SMEs need to realise the impact cybersecurity issues can have on their business. Many SMEs  believe that cybersecurity controls that are included in the IT products they have purchased will  1 https://ec.europa.eu/trade/policy/eu-position-in-world-trade/  2 https://ec.europa.eu/growth/smes_en  25M  SMEs exist in  Europe. They are  the backbone of  EU economy.  https://ec.europa.eu/trade/policy/eu-position-in-world-trade/ https://ec.europa.eu/growth/smes_en  CYBERSECURITY FOR SMES  June 2021  4  suffice and that no additional security controls are necessary, unless mandated by regulations  or Law.  Our recommendations towards SMEs are three-fold:   people,   processes and   technical.  They include keeping software up to date, applying strict access control rules, making use of  cloud services, having a plan for cyber-incidents and many others. For a full list of  recommendations, see Chapter 5. The report also includes recommendations for national and  European authorities.  The report is accompanied by a guide3, providing SMEs with practical 12 high level steps on  how to better secure SMEs' systems and their business.  3 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/cybersecurity-guide-for-smes  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/cybersecurity-guide-for-smes  CYBERSECURITY FOR SMES  June 2021  5  TABLE OF CONTENTS  1.

INTRODUCTION  Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are the backbone of the EU's economy. They  represent 99% of all businesses in the EU and employ around 100 million people4. There were  slightly more than 25 million SMEs in the EU-28 in 2018. They also account for more than half  of Europe’s GDP and play a key role in adding value in all sectors of the EU economy. They  serve both as enablers for the digital transformation, and as a core element of the EU social  fabric.  Since the early spring of 2020, quarantine measures to prevent the spread of the COVID-19  virus were imposed on more than 3.9 billion people worldwide. This unprecedented situation  affected education, work, commercial and social life.  Figure 1: New implemented technologies to avoid contact due to COVID19  Many companies urged employees to work remotely using online collaboration platforms,  e-commerce, e-banking, and e-government services were enhanced, education activities shifted  to e-learning and their use became part of many citizens' reality. In addition, traditional business  had to implement changes to avoid contact or crowded places, and implemented technologies  such as QR codes, contactless payments, and direct-to-consumer models such as home  delivery, click and collect services and remote assistance via chat or phone.  The recent crisis also showed how important the digitisation of processes is for maintaining  business operations. The promotion and implementation of digitisation in all sectors, not only in  e-commerce, is accelerating and expanding. SMEs have to take business continuity measures,  and improve online processes and related infrastructure to ensure their secure functioning.  They also have the opportunity to join forces within their sectoral associations, and cooperate  with partners and collaborators to guarantee the cybersecurity of their sectors.  Criminals are taking advantage of the fear and uncertainty that many citizens are experiencing  because of the pandemic. We are witnesses to a marked increase in malicious emails, phishing  attacks, scams and malware related to the COVID-19 crisis, In addition there is an increase in  the number of cyberattacks targeting specific industries already under strain, such as hospitals,  healthcare providers, and medical research facilities. Criminals are also targeting SMEs as they  are aware many SMEs now have staff working remotely, have deployed systems quickly rather  than securely in order to continue to serve their customers, and many do not have adequate  cybersecurity defences in place.  4 https://ec.europa.eu/growth/smes/sme-definition_en  CYBERSECURITY FOR SMES  June 2021  8  It is important that Europe’s small and medium businesses understand their cybersecurity risks,  and what they can do to protect themselves, their customers and their suppliers.  Contrary to the common perception that cyber-attacks occur only against large organizations, all  organizations can be similarly attacked, no matter what their size. Criminals often target SMEs  for various reasons such as they offer a good value to risk ratio and as many SMEs provide  services to larger organizations they can enable criminals attack those larger organizations  through their supply chain.  Despite the measures an organization can implement to protect proactively itself against cyber  related risks, there is no guarantee that it will not experience a cybersecurity related incident.  Therefore, an SME should develop plans and capabilities to recover as quickly as possible and  maintain business continuity after a cyber-related disruption.  Research and real-life practice demonstrates that organizations, who have prepared plans and  capabilities to deal with a cybersecurity related incidents deal with such incidents in a much  better and more efficient way than organizations that have no preparations in place. While often  in reality, the impact of a cybersecurity incident never fully reflects the planning carried out, the  preparations in creating those plans create a mind-set of awareness and improve team  cooperation in a crisis. As an old military saying goes - plans are useless but planning is  indispensable. The way that an organization will respond to a cybersecurity incident, will  determine the chances of recovering from the incident successfully. In today’s world,  organizations will not be judged by the fact they suffered a cybersecurity breach, but they will be  judged by how well they handle and respond to the breach.  While it is important for SMEs to have these preparations in place, it is important to remember  that these preparations need to be adapted to the specific circumstances of each SME, such as  their internal capabilities, as well as their legal, regulatory, and contractual requirements.  Effective cybersecurity provide SMEs with the confidence that allows them in an online and  interconnected world to grow, innovate, and find new ways of creating value for their customers.  The advice and guidance in this report provides simple measures that, if implemented, can  significantly help to avoid or mitigate the impact of a cybersecurity incident affecting an SME.  The language is clear, the actions are simple, and the guidance is tailored to small and  medium/sized businesses.  1.1 SCOPE / OBJECTIVES  In the current situation of the COVID19 pandemic, ENISA intends to analyse the ability of EU  SMEs to cope with cybersecurity issues in a crisis by identifying cybersecurity challenges and  determining good practices.  Taking note of the challenges and the good practices, this report provides cybersecurity advice  for SMEs to successfully cope with cybersecurity challenges, but also proposals for actions  towards Member States to support SMEs improve their cybersecurity posture.  1.2 TARGET AUDIENCE  The report intends to deliver actionable guidance to the owners and employees of SMEs. In  addition, this work can be of use to other entities involved in the SME ecosystem, such as SMEs  national and European associations, policy makers and implementers, SME ICT providers and  others.  1.3 METHODOLOGY OVERVIEW  The methodology followed to collect and assess the information for this study included;  CYBERSECURITY FOR SMES  June 2021  9   conducting desktop research,   carrying out an online survey aimed at SMEs,   running interviews with some of the survey respondents   interviewing industry experts.  The information derived from each stage of the process, was used to prepare and further  customize the next stage.  In the end, the collected information was analysed, cross-referenced and concentrated in order  to provide tangible results in line with the purpose of this study. The report was validated with  the survey participants, ENISA subject matter experts, the National Cybersecurity Security  Strategies Group, and the National Liaison Officers network.  For the detailed report methodology, consult Annex A.3 Methodology.  1.4 SME CHARACTERISTICS  Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) represent 99% of all businesses in the EU. There  were slightly more than 25 million SMEs in the EU-28 in 2018, of which 93% were micro SMEs  Based on the EU definition5.  The main factors determining whether an enterprise is an SME are  staff headcount combined with either turnover or balance sheet total (Table 1).  Figure 2: SMEs characteristics  According to the latest (November 2019) ANNUAL REPORT ON EUROPEAN SMEs  2018/20196 of the European Commission micro SMEs are by far the most common type of  SME, accounting for 93.0% of all enterprises and 93.2% of all SMEs in the Non-Financial  Business Sector (NFBS). However, micro SMEs accounted for only 29.7% of total employment  in the NFBS, while small and medium-sized SMEs accounted respectively for 20.1% and 16.8%  of total NFBS employment.

KEY SURVEY FINDINGS  2.1 SURVEY DEMOGRAPHICS  In total, 249 SMEs from 25 European Member States of the European participated in our online  survey, with the following characteristics:  Figure 3: Types of SMEs that answered the survey  The participants belonged to all sectors of the economy from accommodation to manufacturing  (for industry sections see Annex, Table A.1.).  More than 30% of the participants use ICT as a primary or secondary activity within their  business and more than 20% of the participants carried out professional, scientific and technical  activities as a primary or secondary activity.  The countries involved were Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, Czech Republic,  Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Lithuania, Luxembourg,  Malta, The Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovak Republic, Slovenia, Spain, and  Sweden.  CYBERSECURITY FOR SMES  June 2021  11  2.2 SURVEY CONCLUSIONS  From the participants’ responses some general conclusions can be drawn, regarding the role of  ICT and the cybersecurity posture of SMEs:  1. There is an increasing dependency on computers and the internet for all types of  SMEs.  Figure 4: Increased dependency on information services  Figure 5: Cybersecurity a key concern for the majority of businesses  CYBERSECURITY FOR SMES  June 2021  12  2. The majority of SMEs (>80%) process critical information, making cybersecurity  a key concern.  The term critical information as defined in the survey refers to information that if it is  stolen or lost, the organization would face serious legal repercussions and the owners  of the personal information could encounter significant or even irreversible  consequences (e.g. misappropriation of funds, blacklisting by financial institutions,  property damage, loss of employment, subpoena, worsening of health, inability to  work, long-term psychological or physical ailments,).  Figure 6: Criticality and sensitivity of processed information as perceived by SMEs  3. The majority of SMEs use some basic security controls such as endpoint antivirus  protection, backups, firewalls and perform systematic software updates. At the same  time fewer SMEs perform security awareness trainings of staff and utilise logging and  alerting systems.  Figure 7: Technological and Organizational Controls used by SMEs  CYBERSECURITY FOR SMES  June 2021  13  4. SMEs utilise the cloud for various information services and remote access tools  of various types, functionalities and security levels.  5. 25 % of participants who used some type of remote access before the COVID-19  pandemic, during the pandemic resorted to cloud services that allow, as a  minimum, access to and processing of e-mails, file processing and  communication  Figure 8: Use of Cloud  Figure 9: Use of Remote Access  6. Phishing, Malware and web-based attacks are the most common causes of  security incidents experienced by the survey participants.  Figure 10: Distribution of Cybersecurity Incidents based on their origin  The survey showed that 45% of SMEs who responded to the survey implemented new  technologies in response to the pandemic. The majority of these initiatives were to facilitate  remote working for staff such as remote access or moving to the cloud.  However, many of  these SMEs (over 90%) did not implement any new security measures, or any additional  security measures, to ensure the security of these solutions. It is also notable that while 36% of  the total respondents reported that they had experienced an incident within the last 5 years, 8%  of the same respondents suffered a cybersecurity incident since the start of the COVID-19  crisis; which, in terms of time, indicates a large increase of incidents during the short time frame  since the start of the COVID-19 period and when the survey was conducted.  In summary, SMEs appear to implement some of the basic cybersecurity measures only as part  of their overall IT implementation. However, it appears that unless cybersecurity controls are  included as part of an IT solution, many SMEs do not realize the potential resultant risks posed  to their business.  CYBERSECURITY FOR SMES  June 2021  14  3. CHALLENGES  Contrary to a concept that cyber-attacks occur only to large organizations, all enterprises can be  attacked regardless of their size and stored information.  Figure 11: Cybersecurity breaches and attacks in the last 12 months  Based on UK Cybersecurity Breaches Survey7 “almost half of businesses (46%) and a  quarter of charities (26%) report having cybersecurity breaches or attacks in the last 12  months. Like previous years, this is higher among medium businesses (68%), large  businesses (75%) and high-income charities (57%)”.  Our findings indicate that the challenges faced by SMEs regarding their cybersecurity  preparedness are many and of different nature. The common underlying issue to all appears  to be management awareness and commitment, which in turn drives budget, allocation of  resources and effective implementation of the cybersecurity practices. Seven categories of  major challenges for SMEs have been identified:   low cybersecurity awareness of the personnel,   inadequate protection of critical and sensitive information,   lack of budget,   lack of ICT cybersecurity specialists,   lack of suitable cybersecurity guidelines specific to SMEs,   shadow IT, i.e. shift of work in ICT environment out of SME’s control,   low management support.  Sixteen SMEs from 14 different countries (Austria, Estonia, Germany, Finland, France, Greece,  Ireland, Italy, Malta, Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Spain), were selected to  participate in semi-structured qualitative interviews through purposive sampling.  The following  7https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/893399/Cyber_Security _Breaches_Survey_2020_Statistical_Release_180620.pdf  https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/893399/Cyber_Security_Breaches_Survey_2020_Statistical_Release_180620.pdf https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/893399/Cyber_Security_Breaches_Survey_2020_Statistical_Release_180620.pdf  CYBERSECURITY FOR SMES  June 2021  15  subsections summarize the cybersecurity landscape from SMEs perspective, indicating, after  the data thematic analysis, their own perceptions regarding the main challenges.  3.1 LOW CYBERSECURITY AWARENESS  Because cybersecurity is a complex issue connected with technical solutions and measures, it  is often perceived that it only concerns IT related people. This, though, is not the case.  Cybersecurity should be part of the culture of the organization. Each person should have at  least basic awareness regarding cybersecurity and how their attitude can affect the  cybersecurity posture of the entire organization.  What is really needed is a transition from initial awareness to internal cybersecurity culture. For  example workers should know and understand how spear phishing and other social engineering  attacks work, rules of using their own devices to access company ICT environment, and other  basic cybersecurity precaution measures.  Figure 12: Top cyber-threat  According to the ENISA Threat Landscape 20208, 84% of cyberattacks rely on social  engineering. Furthermore, the number of phishing victims in the EU continues to grow with  malicious actors using the COVID-19 theme to lure them in. COVID-19-themed attacks  include messages carrying malicious file attachments and messages containing malicious  links that redirect users to phishing sites or malware downloads.  3.2 INADEQUATE PROTECTION FOR CRITICAL AND SENSITIVE  INFORMATION  SMEs handle a variety of information: personnel records, customer information, details about  production, procurement details, financial data, policies, procedures, and other. Each of them  has a different value to the organization and laws, regulations or agreements that may mandate  their protection.  Not having a specific backup up policy, an endpoint antimalware solution implemented on all  types of devices and kept up-to-date, using obsolete or just unpatched software that does not  auto update, could seriously jeopardize the company’s critical and sensitive information, making  the SME an easy target for cyberattacks like ransomware or other.  8 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/enisa-threat-landscape-2020-main-incidents  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/enisa-threat-landscape-2020-main-incidents  CYBERSECURITY FOR SMES  June 2021  16  Figure 13: Cybersecurity Threat Landscape  Based on ENISA’s Threat Landscape reports of 2020, Ransomware was the second  most common threat, and was related to one-third (28%) of security incidents.  In addition, according to the ENISA Threat Landscape Report 2018, weak or reused  passwords (56 %) and unlocked devices (44 %) are two of the biggest weaknesses within  organisations.  3.3 BUDGETARY ISSUES  Cybersecurity preparedness efforts entail investments from various aspects: such as awareness  training, implementation of cybersecurity controls, engaging external experts, and specialized  training for staff members dedicated to information security. Dedicated cybersecurity solutions,  as advanced firewalls or security information and event management systems (SIEM), are also  large investments.  While many SMEs have engaged with the cloud under subscription model, due to their size  many SMEs often do not qualify for special offers and have to deal with fixed cybersecurity SLA  contract clauses, unable to reach the SLA flexibility dedicated to large organizations. Advanced  solutions offering great variety of abilities and possible customizations useful for more  cybersecurity-mature organizations, are often not used by SMEs due to SMEs not being aware  of understanding the solutions offered. In many cases, the cybersecurity features are often part  of high-level subscription plans which may not be suitable to an SME.  This trend is evident from our study, which highlighted that while many SMEs engaged with new  solutions in reaction to the COVID19 pandemic many of them did not invest in any additional  security controls  While not specific to the cybersecurity challenges posed by the COVID19 pandemic, it is evident  that many SMEs view cybersecurity as a cost rather than as an investment in their business.  This is in spite of how many SMEs admitted that a major cybersecurity incident resulting in their  ICT systems being unavailable would have a major negative impact on their business. It is  therefore critical that SMEs understand better the risks to their business posed by cybersecurity  issues and subsequently allocate appropriate budgets to invest in the required controls to  protect their business.  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/ransomware https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/enisa-threat-landscape-report-2018  CYBERSECURITY FOR SMES  June 2021  17  Figure 14: Cybersecurity VS Costs  In our study, the interviewees noted that implementation cost is a major challenge. They  indicated that “the VPNs are costly and cumbersome”, “the antivirus and other software  security measures are expensive” and “security comes on an additional cost”.  3.4 LACK OF ICT CYBERSECURITY EXPERTISE & PERSONNEL  Cybersecurity is a specialized topic, requiring specialized knowledge, however it is quite  common within an SME that individuals multitask and may have multiple roles assigned to them.  As a result, an employee within a SME may be responsible for cybersecurity, as well as for  other processes.  While there are several cybersecurity related standards that SMEs could implement to improve  their cybersecurity readiness, such as the ISO 27001:2013 Information Security Standard9 and  the Federal Office for Information Security (BSI) IT-Grundschutz10, the implementation of these  standards can be a time-consuming process.  Compounding the challenges in this area is that many cybersecurity solutions require  specialized IT knowledge to implement and manage them properly. All of these issues  combined make managing cybersecurity within a SME a big challenge.  As an SME’s business grows and changes, the technology they employ will change and the  cyber threat landscape will constantly alter, which requires SMEs to ensure their efforts to  manage cybersecurity should be continuous and consistent. If the company does not directly  employ a person with specialized ICT knowledge (typical for non-technical SMEs), there is need  to invest in external expert assistance.  Cybersecurity vendors should also be required to ensure their products are secure by default  and that managing these products should be relatively straightforward for non-technical people.  Simple to follow standards and guidelines aimed specifically at the SME sector should be  developed within each Member State, such as the Cyber Essentials scheme11 within the UK  and the “12 Steps to Cybersecurity Guide”12 published by the Irish Government.  9 https://www.iso.org/isoiec-27001-information-security.html  10 https://www.bsi.bund.de/EN/Topics/ITGrundschutz/itgrundschutz_node.html  1111 https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/cyberessentials/overview  12 https://www.ncsc.gov.ie/pdfs/Cybersecurity_12_steps.pdf  https://www.iso.org/isoiec-27001-information-security.html https://www.bsi.bund.de/EN/Topics/ITGrundschutz/itgrundschutz_node.html https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/cyberessentials/overview https://www.ncsc.gov.ie/pdfs/Cybersecurity_12_steps.pdf  CYBERSECURITY FOR SMES  June 2021  18  The interview participants highlighted this challenge by saying that “dealing with security  threats is hard for non-IT related SMEs”, and that “there is a shortage of skills in the  population regarding cybersecurity”.  In addition, they mentioned that “usually SMEs do not have a CISO”. This is further  substantiated by the results of the online survey where only 28% of the participants (almost  half of them in the ICT industry) declared that they have assigned the role of the  Information Security Officer to someone within their organization.  3.5 LACK OF SUITABLE GUIDELINES  Another challenge for SMEs is the availability and suitability of guidelines in the form of  standards, whitepapers or other. There are existing documents13, however most of them, either  provide generic information, such as  “implement backup”, or address larger organizations with  an existing cybersecurity framework where more specialization is possible, for example “appoint  an information security officer and make sure that segregation of duties is applied”.  In addition, some of the well-known standards e.g. ISO 27001:201314 describe an approach for  the design, implementation, operation, control and improvement of an Information Security  Management System, which for many SMEs require external expert assistance to understand  and implement.  While several EU bodies and Member States have issued guidelines in relation to cybersecurity  the respondents highlight that many were not aware these were available, that some of them  were outdated, and that a lot of the material is written to highlight the theory behind  cybersecurity without providing practical guidelines.  The following table outlines some guidelines that are available both at the EU level and at the  national level. However, there is a lack of consistency on these guidelines across all Member  States and not all Member States provide guidelines in their own national language(s)  13 https://ccb.belgium.be/en/document/guide-sme  14  https://www.iso.org/standard/54534.html  https://ccb.belgium.be/en/document/guide-sme https://www.iso.org/standard/54534.html  CYBERSECURITY FOR SMES  June 2021  19  Table 1: Available guidelines at EU and National level  Level Organization Guideline  European  ENISA  Tips for Cybersecurity when buying online15  Information Security and Privacy Standards for SMEs16  Europol Safe Teleworking Tips and Advice17  CyberWatching.EU Cybersecurity Self-Assessment for SMEs18  Belgium  Cybersecurity Coalition Cybersecurity Guide for SME19  Centre for Cybersecurity Belgium Cybersecurity Guide for SME20  Finland  Finnish Transport and  Communications Agency National  Cybersecurity Centre  Information security under exceptional circumstances -  Instructions for organizations and companies21.

The participants confirmed that this is a major issue. They noted that “a generic certification  scheme does not help”, and that the “guidelines from governments and policy makers are  too abstract”.  Towards this, “missing guidelines about applying security and privacy legislation” was  another perception according to the respondents. Additionally, an interesting statement  concerned that “each enterprise has different context and needs, generic guidelines should  be extracted in the sense that the companies will be able to apply them”.  3.6 SHADOW IT/PERSONAL DEVICES  Many SMEs have allowed their staff to use their own personal devices to access company data.  This was a common practice before the COVID19 pandemic but was accelerated even more as  a result of the pandemic. In response to the demand for remote working when the COVID19  pandemic struck, many SMEs did not have the budget, resources, or indeed the time to  purchase and configure corporate devices for each of their remote workers. As a result, many  SMEs allowed their staff to use their own personal devices such as computers, tablets, and  smartphones to access company systems and data.  In addition, to staff using their own personal devices for business purposes they are also  accessing the internet, and therefore corporate systems and data, from their own home  networks. In many cases, these home networks are using consumer grade technology for items  such as broadband connectivity and wireless networks, which may not be as secure as the  business level technology employed by the SME in its own network. Compounding the use of  these potentially less secure home networks is the issue that these home networks are also  shared with others within the house. The devices others in the household use could pose an  additional security threat to the SME’s systems as they may not be configured in a secure  manner.  In effect, the COVID19 Pandemic has extended the SME’s network perimeter from the  locations associated with the SME’s business premises, to the homes of all its employees.  The use of personal devices is not the only concern with remote working, the use of personal  cloud services poses another risk that SME’s need to be aware of.  Staff, in an effort to be  productive and to enable sharing of company data, may use their own personal cloud services  for email or for sharing files. This is further exasperated if the SME does not have the facilities  set up to enable remote workers to collaborate effectively. Many SMEs may have employed a  Virtual Private Network (VPN) to allow remote access to its network and data, however these  VPNs may not be suitable or designed to support all of the SME’s staff access remotely. This  can then result in staff becoming frustrated with the technology in place and in an effort to get  their work done may employ their own personal cloud and email services.  3.7 MOVING ONLINE  Many SMEs surveyed had a relatively small online presence prior to the COVID19 Pandemic.  This typically consisted of a website providing details about their business. Many SMEs did not  use the Internet for online selling or direct engagement with their clients. However, with the  various lockdowns introduced by many Member States to counter the spread of COVID19 and  the resulting hesitancy of consumers to shop and engage in a face to face setting, many SMEs  faced the challenge on how to continue providing services to their clients without interacting with  them physically. This drove a large number of SMEs to convert all or parts of their business to  be delivered over the Internet. Businesses such as shops, restaurants, and craft businesses  rushed to set up an online presence from which they could promote and sell their products.  CYBERSECURITY FOR SMES  June 2021  22  Figure 15: Increase selling online  In Ireland, the annual report from the national registry for .ie domain names, showed a 25%  increase in the number of SMEs selling their products online of via an online store. In  addition, the same report highlights that 55% of Irish SMEs have invested in their online  presence since the beginning of the pandemic, up from just 21% in 2020.54  However, in the rush to get online and enable their businesses to survive many SMEs have not  invested either time or money in ensuring these online services are secure. Features such as  Multi-Factor Authentication to access sensitive systems such as email, ensuring websites are  regularly patched, and other security configurations were not configured by default. As a result,  many SMEs are now at risk of these services becoming compromised.  3.8 LOW MANAGEMENT SUPPORT  A key success factor for any business initiative within a company, no matter its size, is having  senior management support for that initiative. It is well known that without management support  any initiative will flounder and eventually fail. This is particularly true with cybersecurity as it can  be very hard to convince management to invest time, resources and money into something that  is hard to demonstrate brings direct value to the business. While in larger organizations senior  management can rely on their own cybersecurity experts or bring that expertise into the  organization using consultants, many SMEs do not have this luxury. Instead, senior  management within an SME often rely on their own knowledge of issues or what they learn from  their peer networks. As such, there is low awareness amongst SMEs that they face many  cybersecurity threats with many of them thinking they “are too small for criminals to want to hack  them.”  Contrary to a concept that cyber-attacks occur only to large organizations, all enterprises can be  similarly attacked, regardless of their size and stored information. SMEs are an interesting  target for cyber-attacks, because criminals may consider them to be easy targets due to SMEs  not having robust cybersecurity measures in place. In addition, as many SMEs provide services  to larger organizations an SME could be of interest to cybercriminals as a way to attack the  supply chain of this larger organization.  Management leadership and support can be demonstrated by providing specific objectives  regarding cybersecurity, provision of resources (human or others), the support for cybersecurity  policies, procedures and controls, and the establishment of risk appetite in relation to  cybersecurity – level of risk that an organization is ready to accept, before action is deemed  necessary to reduce, avoid or share (transfer) it.  54 https://www.weare.ie/tipping-point/  https://www.weare.ie/tipping-point/  CYBERSECURITY FOR SMES  June 2021  23  Figure 16: Increased management responsibility  The importance of management leadership is highlighted also by the SMEs as “it is the  task of the manager to continue to motivate and monitor the people. The manager should  make the employee understand what the value of security is and to make sure that they  continue to uphold the measures.”  CYBERSECURITY FOR SMES  June 2021  24  4. CYBERSECURITY INCIDENTS  Many SMEs falsely think that because of their small size they are of no interest to  cybercriminals. There is an assumption that cybercriminals prefer to target larger organizations  as those organizations have items that are of more interest to criminals, such as large amounts  of financial details belonging to customers or sensitive and valuable intellectual property.  However, criminals do not target only large organizations and will attack any company no matter  its size. They often prefer to attack smaller firms as there is a higher likelihood of these  companies not having sophisticated cybersecurity measures in place and therefore easier for  criminals to compromise.  The following are real life incidents that occurred against SMEs within the EU since the start of  the pandemic and highlight that criminals have no hesitation in taking advantage of poor  cybersecurity no matter how big or small the organization is.  Note to preserve the anonymity of the victims we have removed as much identifying information  as possible.  4.1 IT SERVICE PROVIDER COMPANY RANSOMWARED   Company Type : IT Software Service Provider   Company Size : < 50 employees   Breach Type : Ransomware attack  An IT service company provides updates of its software to its clients using 15 servers hosted in  a datacenter. Normally access to these servers was only allowed from the company’s own office  network, where its development team was based. As a result, of the pandemic all of the  company’s staff were moved to working from home. To facilitate remote working for its  developers the company enabled the developers to access the 15 servers in its datacenter via  the Microsoft Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP). However, the company did not secure their RDP  connections and criminals were able to breach their systems resulting in 14 of the 15 servers  becoming victims of a ransomware attack.  The company was lucky that the remaining server,  which had not yet been encrypted stored the backups of all the other servers, so they were able  to quickly restore services and then secured their RDP connections.  Lessons learnt:   If using RDP for remote access ensure it is secured55   Backups are an effective method to recover from a ransomware attack. Ensure that  you carry out regular backups and that they are stored offline so that criminals cannot  encrypt the backups.   Provide security awareness training to staff on selecting secure passwords  55https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2020/04/16/security-guidance-remote-desktop-adoption/  https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2020/04/16/security-guidance-remote-desktop-adoption/  CYBERSECURITY FOR SMES  June 2021  25  4.2 STOLEN LAPTOP   Company Type : Legal Firm   Company Size : <25 employees   Breach Type : Laptop stolen containing sensitive client data  A legal firm in response to the pandemic allowed its staff to work from home. However, not all  staff had company issued laptops and would use traditional desktop computers when in the  company’s office. To facilitate working from home the legal firm allowed staff to use their own  personal laptops. One member of staff was the victim of a burglary in their own, which resulted  in their personal laptop being stolen. The member of staff had been using this laptop for working  remotely and had copied all the clients’ information and emails onto the hard drive of their  laptop. The laptop was not encrypted therefore the data held on it is easily accessible to anyone  who gets access to the laptop  Lessons Learnt   Restrict staff to accessing only data they need access to in order to do their job   Ensure all portable devices are encrypted   Provide security awareness to staff on the risks of portable devices and how to protect  them  4.3 EMAIL ACCOUNT HIJACKED TO FACILITATE FRAUD   Company Type : Marketing and branding company   Company Size : <25 employees   Breach Type : Email account hijacked  A marketing and branding company moved their email system to a cloud based solution to  facilitate their staff to work remotely during the pandemic. One member of staff fell victim to a  phishing attack, which pretended to be from the email provider looking for account verification  details. Once the member of the staff entered their details, the criminals took over their email  account. The criminals then sent emails from that hijacked account to clients of the marketing  and branding company. These emails were a mixture of phishing emails and invoice redirection  fraud emails. The invoice redirection fraud emails were sent to some clients telling them the  banking details for the marketing and branding company had changed and that all future  payments for invoices should be sent to that new bank account (which was controlled by the  criminals). The phishing emails targeted clients of the marketing and branding company and  contained a link purporting to be a link to an outstanding invoice. When a client clicked on the  link it would ask the client for their user details and password.  The attack was detected by one of the marketing and branding firm’s customers, when a  member of that company’s staff clicked on the link within the phishing email and noticed the site  was a phishing site. The firm that notified the marketing and branding firm of the attack  subsequently cancelled all future business to the value of €200,000 to €300,000 annually over  concerns about cybersecurity.  Lessons Learnt   Enable Multi-Factor Authentication on hosted platforms   Provide security awareness training to staff to enable them identify phishing emails   Implement strong password policies for hosted platforms  CYBERSECURITY FOR SMES  June 2021  26  4.4 RANSOMWARED PC & SERVER   Company Type : Leisure/Sports Club   Company Size : <75 employees   Breach Type : Ransomware Attack  A leisure/sports club closed its onsite business at the start of the pandemic but allowed staff to  work remotely. To facilitate remote working the IT provider for the club installed remote desktop  sharing software on each of the employee’s company PC. This allowed each member of staff to  remotely connect to their office PC from home and work on their office PC as if they were  physically at the PC.  One member of staff received an email with an attachment in the email. The subject line was “Is  this your photo?” Upon opening the attachment, the ransomware installed on the computer  encrypting all files on that computer and on the file shares, it was accessing from the company’s  file server. This resulted in all the shared data in the company becoming encrypted.  The IT company were able to retrieve their data by using the Europol CyberCrime Centre’s  (EC3) NoMoreRansom website56 which provided them with the keys to decrypt the data.  Further investigations revealed that the PC that became infected did not have an up to date  anti-virus software installed, nor was the latest software patches and updates applied. This was  due to no-one being in the office to check and ensure the patches and updates had been  applied.  Lessons Learnt   Ensure all software on all PCs is patched and up to date.   Ensure anti-virus software on all PCs is up to date   Implement spam and virus filtering on incoming emails to block emails detected to  contain malicious content   Have secure, reliable, and up to date backups stored offline   Provide security awareness training to staff to enable them identify malicious emails   Implement tools to alert if software is not patched and updated on PCs   Implement tools to alert if anti-virus software is not up to date   Ensure alerting mechanisms are in place to warn of ongoing attacks, such as a  computer virus infection  4.5 CEO FRAUD   Company Type : Technology Company   Company Size : <75 employees   Breach Type : CEO Fraud  A technology company that specializes in website development became the victim of CEO fraud  resulting from a member of staff acting upon a fraudulent email they thought came from their  CEO. The company have moved all staff to remote working but as their email server was still on  their premises with poor broadband connectivity, staff were also using their own personal email  accounts to communicate with each other. A member of the finance team received what they  56 https://www.nomoreransom.org/  https://www.nomoreransom.org/  CYBERSECURITY FOR SMES  June 2021  27  thought was an email from the CEO asking for urgent payment to be made to a new supplier in  order to meet a project deadline. The email was not from the CEO but was crafted to look like it  came from them.  The member of staff only discovered the issue the next day when talking to  the CEO by phone and informed them the payment had been made.  Lessons Learnt   Ensure all staff, especially those in privileged role such as finance, follow written  processes and procedures.   Ensure management will not discipline staff for when they do follow proper processes  and procedures   Provide company systems for staff to communicate securely  CYBERSECURITY FOR SMES  June 2021  28  5. RECOMMENDATIONS  Our survey demonstrated that many SMEs had already some common cybersecurity measures  before the COVID19 Pandemic struck. However, the majority of these controls were basic  technical controls, such as firewalls and anti-virus software, and were the responsibility of the IT  person.  There are several publications issued by member states and other countries such as the United  Kingdom, Australia, and the United States that offer guidelines and recommendations to SMEs  on how to improve their cybersecurity.  Cybersecurity does not necessarily have to be costly for SMEs to implement and maintain.  Several measures can be implemented, without the company having to invest a large amount.  Many of these measures are focused primarily on ensuring roles, responsibilities are assigned  to the appropriate personnel, and that staff are aware of cybersecurity risks and how to identify  and protect against them. Many of the technical cybersecurity measures are also relatively cost  effective to implement and need not be necessarily overly sophisticated or complex.  The core cybersecurity fundamentals outlined in the above publications, and identified from our  survey and research, can be summarized in the following areas:  Figure 17: Core cybersecurity fundamental areas  As in any other areas of business, a checklist is an excellent method to ensure you are covering  the key areas in addressing the business issues and risks raised by cybersecurity. An  incomplete or negative response to any of the following items means that area of risk needs to  be addressed.

CYBERSECURITY FOR SMES  June 2021  30  5.1 PEOPLE RECOMMENDATIONS  5.1.1 Responsibility  Cybersecurity is clearly a key element in the ongoing success of any  SME, in particular during the COVID19 pandemic, and it is only  appropriate that responsibility for this critical function is assigned to  someone within the organization.  This role needs not necessarily be a  new job posting as the responsibilities for cybersecurity could be  integrated with the responsibilities of an existing role.  However, it is vital  that if integrating these responsibilities with another role that the  appropriate resources, training and time are given to the person  responsible for cybersecurity. Alternatively, this role could be outsourced  to a third party provider specializing in the area of cybersecurity.  The role of cybersecurity point of contact (or manager, depending on your SME’s naming  conventions) will:   act as a cybersecurity go-to contact, both internally and externally,   implement management directions into real life practice,   measure and report the SME’s performance against the declared security  objectives,   monitor the SME for further security gaps and proactively provide executive staff  with proposals for improvement.  In addition, if the SME has no data protection officer (DPO), he or she will also usually act as  contact for privacy issues.  Technology  Check Item Description  Answer  Network  Security  Are external connections, such as to the Internet, authorised by senior management,  properly documented and secured using Firewalls?  Anti-Virus Are all computer systems protected with the most up to date anti-virus software?  Are  users educated on how to identify and deal with suspect emails or files that may  contain computer viruses?  Encryption Do all devices storing data have full disk encryption enforced? Do you user Virtual  Private Networks (VPNS) when communicating over the Internet on public networks?  Security  Monitoring  Are the log files of important security devices actively monitored to detect potential  security breaches?  Physical  security  Are critical IT resources, such as file servers, secured in a secured area that is  protected from unauthorised access?  Are home office measures in place ensuring secured areas comparable to the office  (closed doors when leaving the workplace, no third party access to information via  windows or else)?  Secure  Backups  A good backup may save your business from a ransomware attack. Do you regularly  backup critical data and systems to secure offline storage? Do you regularly test  restoring from your backups to verify you can fully recover your data and systems?  CYBERSECURITY FOR SMES  June 2021  31  5.1.1.1 Management Commitment  Another critical success factor in effective cybersecurity is the commitment and the leadership  exhibited by management. Without effective support from management, many initiatives within a  business will fail. This applies to all aspects of the business but in particular to cybersecurity.  Cybersecurity demands resources such as time from personnel, the purchasing of cybersecurity  software, services, and hardware, training for staff, and the development of effective policies.  Management need to ensure those resources are available in a timely manner to ensure all  cyber related threats and risks to the business are appropriately managed.  Management should actively support cybersecurity efforts by giving them priority as far as  allocation of resources and budget is concerned. A key way to demonstrate leadership in this  area is for management to be very visible in their own participation in security awareness  training, ensuring that they comply with the company’s own cybersecurity policies, and that they  actively encourage staff to participate in trainings, support the decisions, policies and  procedures and provide a vision regarding cybersecurity.  Finally, management within SMEs should ensure that cybersecurity is a standing item on the  agenda for company management meetings; this is to guarantee that cybersecurity is regularly  discussed at the highest level within the company and is not something that is thought of only  when there is a problem.  5.1.2 Employee Buy-in  Just as important as having responsibility for cybersecurity assigned to an  appropriate person and to have commitment from the SME’s  management to cybersecurity is ensuring employees buy in to having  effective cybersecurity in place. It is essential that employees understand  the importance that good cybersecurity is in protecting the organization,  protecting the personal data entrusted by customers to that organization,  and ultimately in protecting the employees’ jobs.  Gaining employee buy-in for cybersecurity is critical and can only be got through effective  communication on cybersecurity from management, by management openly supporting  cybersecurity initiatives, appropriate trainings delivered to employees, and providing employees  with clear and specific rules outlined in cybersecurity policies.  Every SME employee should have the answers to these questions:   Am I allowed to access the company network and systems from a home  computer? Can I access work email using my private smartphone? If so, what are  the requirements?   What is the process I need to follow when a supplier sends a request asking for  their payment details to be changed?   What should I do after receiving a phishing email?   Am I allowed to use software that is not approved by my IT on my work computer?   What is the approved method for me to share company data with others,  especially those outside the company? Is there an approved file sharing platform  that I can use?   How can I access work email when accessing it over public Wi-Fi such as a hotel,  airport, or indeed my home wireless network?   How do I ensure my passwords are secure?  CYBERSECURITY FOR SMES  June 2021  32  5.1.3 Employee Awareness  While technical controls can minimize the risks posed by various threats,  the human factor is one that needs to be constantly managed. If staff are  not made aware of cybersecurity threats, the reasons the SME has  employed certain cybersecurity policies and controls, or how employees  should react to a suspect security breach, then the risk of a security  breach occurring increases significantly.  SMEs should provide regular cybersecurity awareness for employees to ensure they can  recognize and appropriately deal with the various cybersecurity treats that face SMEs.  The security awareness program should be tailored for the audience and should focus on topics  relevant to the audience’s role. For example, the content of the training for people working in  finance may be different for those working within the sales and marketing function.  Records of the training courses and those who attended should be maintained to ensure staff  members have received the correct training.  Although financial and personal resources of small businesses may be limited, cybersecurity  training does not necessarily mean hiring a specialized lecturer. There are great education  sources on-line, and every SME will surely find one suitable to their needs. Basic tips include:   Cover the main areas: how to recognize a phishing e-mail or an e-mail with a malicious  link or attachment; why an unknown USB drive should not be plugged into any  computer connected to the enterprise network; and why pirate software should not be  installed.   Do not forget to include basic physical security measures, like never leaving your  laptop unattended, or locking devices when not in use.   Consider testing your employees, and if you decide to do so, openly communicate it.  After cyber awareness training, test them with a simulated phishing email of your own  making. If they fail, do not „name & shame“, but educate further.   Collect feedback on the training process and act accordingly, further customizing it to  your needs.  The purpose of these training activities is not to make every staff member a cybersecurity  expert, but rather to provide a basic understanding of the actual and practical cyber related  risks, what the impact to the organization may be, and how their behavior can affect the  outcome. Training should be practical and periodical, tailored to SME’s special conditions and  needs.  5.1.4 Cybersecurity Training  Many SMEs may have responsibility for managing and looking after  their IT systems assigned to someone who may not be formally trained  in cybersecurity. This may be someone internal to the SME or it could  even be an outsourced IT provider, who has competence in IT but not  necessarily in cybersecurity.  Staff responsible for cybersecurity who are not appropriately trained or experienced in the area  may cause issues due to errors caused by lack of knowledge or experience. They may even not  configure a system or device to be secured appropriately.  SMEs should ensure there is a formal cybersecurity training program, with the appropriate  budgeting and resources, for those responsible for managing cybersecurity within the business.  CYBERSECURITY FOR SMES  June 2021  33  Thus, they will have the skills and competencies required to ensure the security, availability, and  ongoing operations of the IT infrastructure within the organization.  Should the SME have their IT and cybersecurity managed and supported by an external third  party then the SME should engage with their provider to determine what level of competencies  that provider had in cybersecurity and what plans do they have in place to ensure they have the  appropriate level of competencies for cybersecurity in place.  5.1.5 Cybersecurity Policies  SMEs should set up clear and specific rules outlined in cybersecurity  policies for its employees on how they are expected to behave when  using the company’s ICT environment, equipment, and services. These  policies should also highlight the consequences an employee could face  should they not adhere to the policies. The SME should ensure these  policies are regularly reviewed, updated, communicated to employees,  and that employees understand those policies,  Every SME employee should have the answers to these questions:   Am I allowed to access the company network and systems from a home  computer? Can I access work email using my private smartphone? If so, what are  the requirements?   What is the process I need to follow when a supplier sends a request asking for  their payment details to be changed?   What should I do after receiving a phishing email?   Am I allowed to use software that is not approved by my IT on my work computer?   What is the approved method for me to share company data with others,  especially those outside the company? Is there an approved file sharing platform  that I can use?   How can I access work email when accessing it over public Wi-Fi such as a hotel,  airport, or indeed my home wireless network?   How do I ensure my passwords are secure?  The ideal policies should be short, succinct, with specific guidelines for employees to follow, and  should be written in easy to understand language.  5.1.6 Third Party Management  Like all organizations, SMEs rely on other organizations to provide them  with services. Some of these services may involve outsourcing of key  business functions to a third party. Indeed, it is not uncommon for SMEs  to outsource the management and support of their IT systems to another  firm specializing in IT.  However, many of the arrangements in place with third parties, particularly concerning  cybersecurity, are informal and may not have appropriate confidentiality clauses within the  contract for service. SMEs should ensure that all vendors, particularly those with access to  sensitive data and/or systems, should be actively managed to ensure they meet agreed service  level commitments. Contractual agreements should regulate how the information will be  accessed during the provision of said service and how will it be treated, as well as penalties,  billing, guarantees and other aspects.  CYBERSECURITY FOR SMES  June 2021  34  To ensure the security of services provided by Third Party vendors or outsourced partners,  SMEs should:   Develop a list of minimum cybersecurity requirements and obligations that vendors  and suppliers must have in place in order for the SME to engage with them   Regularly review and conduct an inventory of all its vendors and suppliers.   Appoint someone with the responsibility to manage these relationships   Ensure Service Level Agreements are in place with each key supplier and that these  are managed and monitored on an ongoing basis.  The above Service Level Agreements should clearly;  o state the scope of the service being provided,  o outline the roles and responsibilities for each party,  o define clear lines of demarcation,  o demonstrate the agreed cybersecurity level of the provided services,  o detail how to report problems and associated escalation procedures,  o include metrics by which the services are measured.   Conduct regular reviews with suppliers, especially those managing data and/or  services on behalf of the SME to ensure the security measures they implement are  appropriate.   Develop a process to manage the end of a service, either expected or unexpected,  with a supplier. This process should ensure that any sensitive data that the vendor  had access to are either securely destroyed or returned to the SME.   Include a Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA) or a confidentiality clause detailing what  data is considered confidential, how long this confidentiality relationship will last,  restrictions on the use of information by the service provider and the legal jurisdiction  accepted.  If the external vendor provider requires access to any personal data under the care of the SME,  a Data Processing Agreement should be put in place as per the requirements outlined in the EU  General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).  5.2 PROCESS RECOMMENDATIONS  5.2.1 Cybersecurity Audits  Without regular cybersecurity audits, or assessments, it is possible that  issues will develop and go undetected by SMEs. Regular audits can  help ensure any issues are identified and remedied before a breach.  Regular cybersecurity audits also ensures an SME can have confidence  that discipline and that its cybersecurity framework is being maintained.  These audits can include assessments on the effectiveness of the  cybersecurity policies that are in place. They can also test the technical  controls to ensure the SME’s firewalls, website, and other critical  systems do not have any weaknesses that could allow an attacker to  gain access.  CYBERSECURITY FOR SMES  June 2021  35  Those with the appropriate knowledge, skills, and experience to conduct effective audits should  carry out regular audits. These people could be internal to the SME. Ideally, they should be  conducted by a party that is independent from the daily operations of the IT systems within the  SME.  5.2.2 Incident Planning and Response  In today’s environment, it is often not a question if a company will suffer a  cybersecurity breach but more likely when will it suffer one. While in the  past companies may have been judged for suffering a breach, today it is  accepted that cybersecurity breaches do occur and that those  organizations that suffer a breach are a victim of a crime. As such, many  will not negatively judge an organization should it fall victim to a crime but  they will judge the organization on how it responds to the incident.  Therefore it is important for SMEs to accept that at some stage they may suffer a cybersecurity  breach and it is important to have a formalized incident response plan in place, as without such  a plan the response to a cybersecurity incident will most likely be ad hoc and unplanned which  often results in;   Disclosure of confidential information.   Prolonged recovery times.   Lack of evidence for a criminal or civil case.   Negative impact to the organisation’s image.   Potential legal and/or compliance Issues.   Potential Legal Cases from Third Party Organisations.   Exposure to Legal/Libel Cases from Employees/Individuals.  SMEs should develop a formal incident response plan, which contains clear guidelines, roles  and responsibilities to ensure that all security incidents are in a professional and appropriate  manner.  This policy should include details of how electronic evidence should be preserved, gathered and  handled and each responsibilities.  Standard Operating Procedures to respond to incidents of different types should also be  developed to include;   The actions to be taken if multiple machines are infected with a computer virus.   Under what conditions, and whose authority, network segments are shut down.   Under what conditions, and whose authority, internet connectivity is disabled.   How computer virus infections are identified and removed.   Who liaises with the press, key stakeholders and public in the event of a serious  incident?   How to liaise with clients and partners, law enforcement, the Data Protection Supervisory  Authority, or other regulators?  CYBERSECURITY FOR SMES  June 2021  36  5.2.3 Passwords  One of the key layers of protection against unauthorized access to a  company’s data is the implementation of a suitable access control  procedure. An SME should ensure its computer network could support  the ability to centrally implement access control such as those provided  by modern network systems like Microsoft Active Directory, or the  Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP).  This will enable the SME to ensure those accessing its systems and data can be centrally  managed and controlled. The ENISA Tips for secure authentication is an excellent resource that  SMEs can refer to to help them address this challenge  When dealing with credentials and more specifically passwords, SMEs should ensure that  employees:   use strong passwords or passphrases which should be long, with lower-and upper-case  characters, possibly also numbers and special characters.  It is preferable that employees use a passphrase – a collection of random common  words combined into a phrase that provide a very good combination of memorability  and security. For example, three random words like:  ‘’ogre swingy glamor’’  present a very strong password and if it can be sprinkled with uppercase characters or  numbers, it’s even stronger. Many national authorities, like UK National Cybersecurity  Centre, also vet the passphrase approach57.  The French Commission Nationale de l'Informatique et des Libertés  (CNIL, National Commission on Informatics and Liberty)  recommends to  organizations that process personal data and employ authentication based  only on an identifier (e.g. username) and a password, that \"password  should have a minimum of 12 characters, and .. must include upper-case  letters, lower-case letters, numbers, and special characters.\"58  Whatever approach you choose, stay away from the obvious, like using word  “password”, sequences of letters like “abc”, sequences of numbers like “123”, keyboard  paths like “qwerty” on English language keyboards, and your real life data like date of  birth or name of your high school. In password creation, randomness is your friend.   do not reuse their work passwords elsewhere   do not attach Post-it notes detailing passwords to their screens or leave passwords  otherwise accessible in written form (they should be encouraged to use a password  manager instead),   We recommend the use of a dedicated password manager (usually superior in features  to the browsers in-built password managers), as they help to keep strong, unique  passwords.  57 https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/blog-post/three-random-words-or-thinkrandom-0  58 https://www.cnil.fr/sites/default/files/atoms/files/recommandation_passwords_en.pdf  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/news/enisa-news/tips-for-secure-user-authentication https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/blog-post/three-random-words-or-thinkrandom-0  CYBERSECURITY FOR SMES  June 2021  37   do not to share their passwords with colleagues (nor user accounts)   Where possible, enforce Multi-Factor Authentication.  Figure 18: Multi-factor authentication technologies  Many services now provide Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)59, which is an additional  step outside of entering a password to verify that the person trying to access the  system is indeed who they claim to be. This often is done by either sending a text  message to a known number for the account holder, using an app that supports  authentication, or by using physical tokens, which must be present at the time of  accessing the account.  Once an employee leaves that organization, the SME should also ensure that they revoke the  employee’s access to business systems if they leave the business.  Master passwords may be stored as part of SME’s contingency planning or to provide backup if  some of the administrators is unavailable. However, they need to be stored in a safe place and  accessible only to authorized personnel.  Figure 19: Overview of weak password issues  According to the ENISA Threat Landscape Report 2018, weak or reused passwords  (56%) and unlocked devices (44%) represent two of the highest risks.  An incident connected with the malfunction of passwords, is one experienced by  Twitter. Specifically, a glitch in the password handling procedure potentially  exposed all users’ passwords in plain text before completing the hashing process.  (ca. 330 million)60.  59 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/csirts-in-europe/glossary/authentication-methods  60 https://www.bbc.com/news/business-43995168  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/enisa-threat-landscape-report-2018 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/csirts-in-europe/glossary/authentication-methods https://www.bbc.com/news/business-43995168  CYBERSECURITY FOR SMES  June 2021  38  5.2.4 Software Patches  Software updates fix known security vulnerabilities, and may improve  the functionality and performance of your program or device. SMEs  need to be prepared to upgrade their systems on a regular basis due to  software and hardware becoming out of date. An SME’s IT infrastructure  should be treated the same way as any other business infrastructure  and modernised on a regular basis;   Update all of their software.   Set up a systematic procedure to keep it that way.   Turn on automatic updates whenever possible.   Identify software and hardware that requires manual updates   Take into account mobile and IoT devices.  SMEs should look at implementing solutions that allows them to centrally manage and control  how and when software patches are applied. This will also enable the SME to have visibility as  to what devices may not have been successfully patched and may need additional attention to  remedy.  A well-known example of how a major security incident happened due to a vulnerability  being exploited before organizations were able to patch their systems was with the  “WannaCry”61 ransomware attack. It is estimated that 230,000 organizations in 150  countries fell victim to these attacks. The estimated losses were 4-8 Billion US $62.  WannaCry indiscriminately targeted vulnerable systems that ran specific versions of the  Windows operating systems with many SMEs falling victim.  5.2.5 Data Protection  Under the EU General Data Protection Regulation any SMEs that  process or store personal data belonging to those resident within the  EU/EEA are required to ensure that appropriate security controls are in  place to protect that data. This includes ensuring that any third parties  working on behalf of the SME have appropriate security measures in  place. The Irish Data Protection Commission provides a guide on the  security measures expected to be in place.63  5.3 TECHNICAL RECOMMENDATIONS  5.3.1 Network Security  According to the results of the online survey, a firewall solution has been  implemented by at least 86% of the participants even before the  COVID19 crisis. This percentage appears to have risen further (90%)  during the crisis.  61 https://www.europol.europa.eu/wannacry-ransomware  62 https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/security/news/vulnerabilities-and-exploits/cybercrime-and-exploits-attacks-on- unpatched-systems  63 https://dataprotection.ie/en/dpc-guidance/guidance-controllers-data-security  https://www.europol.europa.eu/wannacry-ransomware https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/security/news/vulnerabilities-and-exploits/cybercrime-and-exploits-attacks-on-unpatched-systems https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/security/news/vulnerabilities-and-exploits/cybercrime-and-exploits-attacks-on-unpatched-systems  CYBERSECURITY FOR SMES  June 2021  39  Firewalls filter and monitor the incoming and outgoing traffic on the perimeter of trusted and  untrusted networks based on given rules. The effective configuration of these rules is a key  success factor, and should be implemented and gradually tuned up with care. Firewalls may  also provide and manage remote access to the organization by supporting Virtual Private  Networks (VPNs).  When selecting a firewall an SME should also look to see, what additional security features are  provided, either by default or by paying extra fees. Some of these features could include filtering  email and web traffic for malicious software such as viruses, blocking access to known bad  sections of the Internet, and providing alerting and monitoring to potential attacks.  Given the important role firewalls play in protecting an SME’s internal network and systems,  SMEs should ensure they employ the most appropriate firewall for their needs. This may require  engaging with someone who has the relevant expertise that can recommend that most  appropriate solution.  5.3.2 Anti-Virus  Anti-virus software is one of the most commonly used cybersecurity tools for endpoint  protection. It protects against various kinds of malware, unauthorized malicious software  designed to cause harm. Malware can gain access to important information such as bank  credentials, credit card numbers or passwords. It can also take control or spy on a user’s  computer.  The majority (88%) of the survey participants already implemented some form of anti-virus  solution even before the COVID19 pandemic, and the number appears to have further risen  (>90%) during the COVID19 pandemic.  An anti-virus solution should be implemented on all types of devices and kept up-to-date in  order to ensure its continuous effectiveness. This includes employees’ tablets and smartphones  connected to the company network, be it in SME’s or their ownership. This anti-virus solution  should provide the SME with the ability to manage centrally the anti-virus software installed on  all devices within the organization and ensure that it is kept up to date. Should the anti-virus  software on any of the devices detect a potential infection, it should also alert the appropriate  personnel within the SME to deal with the situation.  5.3.3 Employ Email and Web Protection Tools  Email remains a major attack medium and a way to gain a foothold within  the systems of an organization. Malicious e-mails may come in the form  of e-mails with malicious attachments, e-mails containing links to  malware distribution sites, phishing e-mails, or scam e-mails tricking  SMEs into revealing their sensitive data or sending money.  Figure 20: 13% increase since 2019 in Windows malware detections  Despite the increased awareness and implementation of anti-  virus solutions, the ENISA Threat Landscape Report 2020  shows that there was a 13% increase since 2019 in Windows  malware detections at business endpoints globally and that  71% of organizations experienced malware activity that spread  from one employee’s computer to another. The report also  highlighted that malware attacks have grown in volume and in  sophistication.  CYBERSECURITY FOR SMES  June 2021  40  Phishing emails can be very sophisticated, leveraging social engineering practices – creating a  sense of urgency, and often mimicking phrasing, branding and logos of a well-known institution  (such as a bank or a business partner) or just a colleague. Phishing or fraudulent emails target  employees within an SME to trick them into giving away sensitive personal or enterprise  information, such as passwords or credit card numbers. One popular form of malicious emails  targeting SMEs are invoice redirect scams, where cybercriminals create a fake email to look like  it comes from known supplier requesting the account payment details for the supplier be  changed to one controlled by the criminals.  The fact that SME staff may have a low awareness regarding this type of malicious behavior  makes them ideal candidates for criminals to exploit. In tandem with cyber awareness trainings,  SMEs should implement rules that will not allow change of payment details or transfer of funds  based on an email only. Such an important step should also be confirmed using a different  communication channel (in person, by phone, using live videoconference etc.) to prevent cyber  criminals from taking advantage.  The overwhelming amount of news coverage surrounding the novel coronavirus has also  created a new danger — phishing scams looking to exploit public fears about the sometimes-  deadly virus. These fraudulent emails assert to be sent from the World Health Organization or  the US Centre for Disease Control or a renowned specialist offering information or help  regarding COVID-19. You can find ENISA’s advice that is more detailed on how to protect  against phishing attacks in an article on phishing during the COVID-19 pandemic64.  Employees at SME should also know basic web browsing security practices, like how to spot  fraudulent pages and stay clear from installing suspicious browser plug-ins.  In order for organizations to be better prepared against these types of attacks, it is necessary to  combine solutions that will filter out the possible spam emails, email containing link to a  malicious website, emails containing a malicious attachment (i.e. containing a malware  payload), or phishing attempts with relevant and practical training of the organization’s staff.  5.3.4 Encryption  Encryption is information that is scrambled in such a way that only those  with the appropriate access can unscramble that data to read it.  Encryption therefore provides strong protection for sensitive data.  Where  possible SMEs should use encryption to protect data when it is being  stored or being transferred over public networks such as the Internet.  Due to their portable nature, mobile devices, such as laptops and smartphones, are more likely  to be lost or stolen. While the cost of the mobile device itself may not be high the value of the  data held on the device could be quite high. Many modern operating systems have encryption  features built into them, which SMEs should enable to ensure the data stored on mobile devices  are encrypted.  For data that is transferred over public networks, such as hotel or airport Wi-Fi networks, or over  the Internet, SMEs should ensure that data is encrypted, by either employing a Virtual Private  Network (VPN) from a trusted provider or accessing websites over secure connections using  SSL/TLS protocol.  64 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/news/enisa-news/understanding-and-dealing-with-phishing-during-the-covid-19-pandemic  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/news/enisa-news/understanding-and-dealing-with-phishing-during-the-covid-19-pandemic https://www.enisa.europa.eu/news/enisa-news/understanding-and-dealing-with-phishing-during-the-covid-19-pandemic  CYBERSECURITY FOR SMES  June 2021  41  Similarly, for their own websites, especially if that site is being used to support online  transactions, SMEs should ensure they are employing suitable encryption technology to protect  client data as it travels between the SME’s server and the clients’ devices.  5.3.5 Security Monitoring  Many of the systems and devices which SMEs employ, such as servers,  firewalls, and anti-virus software, can log and record system activity to  support troubleshooting and maintenance. In many cases, this also  includes recording any suspicious activity that could be related to a  potential security breach. However, by default there is often no facility to  generate alerts, which often results in breaches occurring without the  victim organizations being aware.  So while SMEs may have the data to alert them to suspicious activity on their systems or  breaches that data is not being actively monitored to alert the SME to these incidents. This is  similar to having a burglar alarm installed on the premises but not turning it on. SMEs should  investigate tools that could monitor and create alerts when suspicious activity or security  breaches are occurring.  5.3.6 Physical Security  Physical security is an important aspect of an overall cybersecurity  program. Sensitive data can be stored in electronic format and in  physical format such as on paper. If there is no appropriate physical  security to protect the data, then criminals can quickly undermine the  cybersecurity controls that may be in place.  It is therefore important to  ensure appropriate physical controls are employed where important  information resides.  A company laptop or a smartphone, for instance, should not be left unattended in the back seat  of a car, and the same principle applies for information on USB drives or prints on a sheet of  paper. To prevent unauthorized access, anytime a user walks away from their computer, be it  on the company premises or elsewhere, they should lock it. Setting auto-lock function, using full  disk encryption and if possible purchasing laptops with TPM chips are a number of measures  that could reinforce physical security. Sensitive printed documents should also not be left  unattended and when not in use securely stored away.  Figure 21: Result of the Hørsholm Municipality security breach  The Danish Data Protection Authority imposed a fine on the  Hørsholm Municipality resulting from a security breach that  happened when an employee had their municipality issued  laptop stolen from their car. On the stolen laptop was personal  data of approximately 1,600 employees at Hørsholm  Municipality, including information of a sensitive nature and  information about social security numbers.  5.3.7 Secure Backups  According to our online survey, more than 90% of the participants were  already taking some kind of backup even before the COVID19  pandemic. This percentage appears to have risen further (>94%) during  the COVID19 pandemic.  CYBERSECURITY FOR SMES  June 2021  42  Irrespective of the root cause, the company should be able to recover its information within a  desirable period. To enable the recovery of the information, backups should be kept, as  they are an effective way to recover for example from ransomware. The exact technology  employed (sophisticated dedicated software, simple scripts or manual backups) remains at the  choice of the organization. In every case, the following rules should apply:  Figure 22: Increase of back-up policies   backup is regular and automated whenever possible,   backup is held separately from the SME’s production environment, i.e. the network that  employees directly interact with,   backups are encrypted, especially if they are going to be moved between locations,   the ability to regularly restore data from the backups is tested. Ideally, a regular test of  a full restore from start to finish should be done.  To ensure an SME has an effective backup strategy the SME should consider employing the  common easy-to-remember so-called 3-2-1 rule approach to safeguard data against most failure  scenarios:  Figure 23: 3-2-1 rule to safeguard data  A retention period should be set and implemented based on the specific circumstances of the  organization. In other words, backup iterations should be set according to business reality of  each company, so the cost of lost data in a given timespan is acceptable. Backup practices  need to be tailored according to the SME infrastructure (on premise vs cloud).  Have at least one off-  site backup, outside of  the SME core ICT  environment, be it in a  remote location or cloud.  Store those copies on  two different storage  media to protect them  against different risks.  Keep three copies of  any important files.  CYBERSECURITY FOR SMES  June 2021  43  In 2017, GitLab experienced an incident, and had to go offline after suffering what appears to  be a major backup restoration failure after accidentally deleting production data. As mentioned  in the company’s blog “out of five backup/replication techniques deployed none are working  reliably or set up in the first place. We ended up restoring a six-hour-old backup” 65 (This  means that data created in the meantime between the last backup and the time of the incident  were lost).  5.4 COVID19 SPECIFIC RECOMMENDATIONS  As stated earlier in this document, many SMEs had to react quickly to the impact of the  COVID19 pandemic and the subsequent widespread lockdowns that many member states  implemented to protect the lives and health of citizens. However, this quick reaction to the  pandemic meant that most SMEs simply focused on keeping their business operating and took  what the necessary steps to ensure staff could work remotely and in some cases, SMEs  changed their business models to service their customers online rather than in traditional face-  to-face situations.  With this background in mind, it is not surprising that SMEs focused primarily on ensuring their  ICT environments operated in such a way to support the SMEs business goals.  Cybersecurity  may not have been a major factor in deciding how to meet those business goals. This focus on  keeping the business running is understandable. However, in the rush to achieve this goal key  cybersecurity measures may not be implemented properly or not implemented at all.  This section of the report will highlight several areas SMEs should examine to ensure the  security of their data, services, and systems.  5.4.1 Review Remote Access Facilities  In response to the pandemic many SMEs installed various ways to  enable staff to access remotely the SME’s network. This could be  installing or upgrading a Virtual Private Network (VPN) for the  organization, or installing remote desktop management tools, enabling  remote connecting protocols such as the Remote Desktop Protocol  (RDP), or by installing other remote access technologies.  SMEs should now review any remote access facilities to ensure they are secure. The following  are the key things SMEs should focus on;   Ensure all remote access software is patched and up date.   Implement a tool or a process to ensure that remote access software will continue to  be patched and kept up to date.   Review the remote access settings to restrict access from known or trusted locations,  such as restricting remote access to staff based in certain geographical locations or  accessing from certain IP addresses.   Restrict staff accessing systems remotely to only the systems and computers they  need access to.   Enforce strong passwords for remote access and where possible enable multi-factor  authentication.   Ensure monitoring and alerting is enabled to warn of suspected attacks or unusual  suspicious activity.  65 https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2017/02/01/gitlab-dot-com-database-incident/  https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2017/02/01/gitlab-dot-com-database-incident/  CYBERSECURITY FOR SMES  June 2021  44  5.4.2 Engage with the Cloud  Many Cloud Service Providers (CSPs) can offer services that will enable  SMEs continue to support their staff working remotely. These can range  from providing email platforms, file-sharing facilities, and video  conferencing, to online collaboration tools. In most cases, the CSP can  secure the services being provided to the SME much more effectively  and efficiently than the SME.  As mentioned earlier in the report SMEs should ensure they keep software installed on their  computer systems patched and up to date. They also need to ensure their anti-virus solution is  managed so that it is kept up data on all devices. Traditionally these two functions were often  managed using servers and software installed on the SME’s own network. However, with many  staff working remotely these solutions many not be as effective.  Moving to cloud based patch management and cloud based anti-virus platforms can provide the  SME with the capability to ensure that their IT infrastructure is being managed and secured.  While offering many advantages, cloud based solutions do provide some unique risks. SMEs  should consider them before engaging with a CSP. ENISA have published a “Cloud Security  Guide for SMEs”66 which SMEs should refer to when migrating to the cloud.  The following are some of the key items an SME should consider before engaging with a CSP;   Determine the physical location where the SME’s data will be stored. This is important  to ensure the SME does not breach any laws or regulations by storing data, especially  personal data, in CSPs located outside of the EU/EEA. For example, the EU GDPR  requires that personal data of residents within the EU/EEA is not stored or transmitted  outside of the EU/EEA unless under very specific conditions.   Implement Multifactor Authentication to ensure that cloud based accounts are at a  lesser risk of being hijacked by criminals. Without MFA implemented on CSP based  services the only protection for the accounts that access those CSP based services  are the passwords people employ on their accounts. If those passwords are weak,  have been reused from other websites, or the account holder falls victim to a phishing  attack, then that could result in a security breach. MFA provides an additional layer of  protection to help prevent this from happening.   Many cloud services are provided with built-in security features, however these are  often turned off by default. SMEs should make sure they understand what the security  features are in the service they are subscribing to and enable them. If the security  features at the current plan the SME is using are not adequate the CSP may offer the  required features at a different plan, which the SME could subscribe to.  66 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/cloud-security-guide-for-smes  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/cloud-security-guide-for-smes  CYBERSECURITY FOR SMES  June 2021  45  5.4.3 Implement Mobile Device Management  When facilitating staff to work remotely many SMEs allowed their staff to  use their own personal devices such as computers, laptops, tablet,  and/or smartphones. While this may have helped ensure the SME could  continue to provide services to its client, it also introduced several  security concerns about the SME’s data stored on those personal  devices. One way for an SME to manage this risk is to employ a Mobile  Device Management (MDM) solution. With a MDM solution a SME could   Control what devices are allowed to access its systems and services.   Ensure the device has up to date anti-virus software installed.   Determine if the device is encrypted.   Confirm if the device has up to date software patches installed.   Enforce the device is protected by a PIN and/or a password.   Remotely wipe any SME data from the device should the device owner report it lost or  stolen, or if the device owner’s employment was to end with the SME.  5.4.4 Conduct Appropriate Security Awareness Training  Criminals will take advantage of all situations if it results in them  achieving their goals. The COVID19 pandemic is a perfect scenario for  criminals to exploit as they can leverage of the fears and concerns that  people have regarding the pandemic. Criminals will look to compromise  accounts and systems using COVID19 themed phishing emails, or use  scam emails pretending to be from couriers to spread malicious  software.  In addition, many staff will now be working remotely from their own homes and may not be  working from a network or device as secure as that provided within the SME’s own office  environment.  With this in mind, it is important for SMEs to ensure staff are regularly updated on what the  latest cybersecurity themed threats are and how they should work securely while working  remotely.  The Irish Data Protection Commission have issued a guide, “Protecting Personal Data When  Working Remotely”67 for companies so they can ensure personal data entrusted ot them is  secured when staff are working remotely.  5.4.5 Secure Online Sites  Many SMEs moved from engaging directly with their customers in face  to face to dealing with them via online. SMEs rushed to set up new  websites so they could sell to their customers online. However, it is  essential that SMEs ensure that their online websites are configured  and maintained in a secure manner. Any personal data or financial  details, such as credit card data, must be appropriately protected. This  will entail running regular security tests against the websites to identify  any potential security weaknesses and conducting regular reviews to  ensure the site is maintained and updated properly.  67 https://dataprotection.ie/en/dpc-guidance/blogs/protecting-personal-data-when-working-remotely  https://dataprotection.ie/en/dpc-guidance/blogs/protecting-personal-data-when-working-remotely  CYBERSECURITY FOR SMES  June 2021  46  5.4.6 Information Sharing  An effective tool in the fight against cybercrime is the sharing of  information. Many firms are afraid of publicly discussing cybersecurity  issues, in particular details about breaches, as they fear negative  publicity resulting from their perceived weakness in relation to  cybersecurity. However, while this may be true in the past, this is no  longer the case as many firms realize that they cannot deal with this  issue by themselves.  The sharing of information in relation to cybercrime is key to SMEs to understand better the  risks they face. Firms that hear about cybersecurity challenges, and how those challenges were  overcome, from their peers will more likely take steps to secure their systems than if they were  to hear similar details from industry reports or from cybersecurity surveys.  A key element in facilitating information sharing is with ISACs, as outlined in our  recommendations at the EU and National level. However, until ISACs are in place SMEs can  use other mechanisms to share good practices for cybersecurity, alerting others to potential  attacks, or how to recover from a breach. Similar to neighborhood watch schemes in the real  world, information-sharing networks in relation to cybersecurity, can quickly improve security for  all. SMEs can look to existing bodies to facilitate this information sharing. Bodies such as  chambers of commerce, industry representative bodies, or local business associations all  provide a useful platform to facilities information sharing and education. These bodies could  also engage with cybersecurity experts to address their members at meetings or conferences to  ensure they are aware of the latest threats and the good practices that SMEs can employ.  CYBERSECURITY FOR SMES  June 2021  47  5.5 MAPPING THREATS TO RECOMMENDATIONS  The survey identified the typical cybersecurity issues experienced by SMEs. These are outlined  in Figure 6. The following table demonstrates how these cybersecurity issues can be managed  by the above recommendations;  Table 3: Mapping threats to recommendations  Issues Categories Recommendations  Phishing  People  Employee Buy-in  Employee Awareness  Cybersecurity Training  Cybersecurity Policies  Process  Incident Planning and Response  Passwords (implement Multi-Factor  Authentication)  Technical  Network Security  Security Monitoring  Web Based Attack  People  Cybersecurity Training  Cybersecurity Policies  Third Party Management  Process  Audits  Incident Planning and Response  Passwords  Software Patches  Data Protection  Technology  Network Security  Anti-Virus  Security Monitoring  Secure Backups  General Malware  People  Employee Buy-in  Employee Awareness  Cybersecurity Training  Cybersecurity Policies  Process  Audits  Incident Planning and Response  Passwords  Software Patches  Data Protection  Technology  Network Security  Anti-Virus  Encryption  Security Monitoring  Secure Backups  CYBERSECURITY FOR SMES  June 2021  48  Issues Categories Recommendations  Malicious Insider  People  Employee Buy-in  Employee Awareness  Cybersecurity Training  Cybersecurity Policies  Process  Audits  Incident Planning and Response  Passwords  Software Patches  Data Protection  Technology  Network Security  Anti-Virus  Encryption  Security Monitoring  Physical Security  Secure Backups  Denial of Service  People  Cybersecurity Training  Cybersecurity Policies  Third Party Management  Process  Audits  Incident Planning and Response  Passwords  Software Patches  Data Protection  Technology  Network Security  Anti-Virus  Security Monitoring  Secure Backups  Social Engineering  People  Employee Buy-in  Employee Awareness  Cybersecurity Training  Cybersecurity Policies  Process  Incident Planning and Response  Passwords (implement Multi-Factor  Authentication)  Technical  Network Security  Security Monitoring  Compromised/Stolen  Device  People  Employee Buy-in  Employee Awareness  Cybersecurity Training  Cybersecurity Policies  Process  Audits  Incident Planning and Response  Passwords  Data Protection  Technology  Encryption  Physical Security  CYBERSECURITY FOR SMES  June 2021  49  6. EU AND NATIONAL LEVEL  RECOMMENDATIONS  The following recommendations are directed towards Regional, National and European  Authorities with the purpose of assisting SMEs in adopting cybersecurity solutions.  It is important to outline that most SMEs who participated in the survey and the interviews  highlighted the lack of applicability and usefulness of the various measures, guidelines, and  approaches to dealing with cybersecurity that some Member State authorities have proposed to  SMEs for adoption.  This shortcoming of existing measures will hopefully be overcome, as this part of the study,  provides recommendations towards policy makers of all levels of government that have been  derived and validated by the affected parties (the SMEs).  6.1 PROMOTE CYBERSECURITY AT LARGE  Specific awareness raising campaigns on cybersecurity issues, which  educate SMEs owners, managers, employees and shareholders, should  be created by the relevant authorities and where possible in partnership  with business representative organizations. Such practices will help the  organizations to understand how they can protect their businesses and  which resources, such a guidelines, standards, and tools they could  possibly use. These campaigns should be orchestrated within Europe  but adjusting its pace and content to specific regional cases.  However, experience has shown that despite regular campaigns, many SMEs do not engage in  these campaigns or the campaigns do not effectively reach the target audience. As such, future  campaigns need to be more focused on the SME sector as a target. It is recommended, that  these campaigns should be run regularly and be customized depending on the topic being  promoted at the time. It is essential that the content is aimed at the needs of the intended  audiences, primarily SMEs, hence the need to partner with business representative  organizations who can highlight those needs to those designing the campaigns. The campaigns  should aim at helping SMEs to understand cybersecurity threats and how these threats can  affect people, in both their personal and professional lives. Finally, the methods of  implementation should be carefully selected, in particular as to how the campaigns are  delivered to the SMEs. It may require tailored content for each business sector with the  emphasis placed on the key issues affecting that business sector (for example, cybersecurity  issues relating to online shopping may not be relevant to business sectors that do not use the  Internet to sell their goods and services).  The effectiveness of these campaigns must be measured to ensure the key messages are  being delivered and that cybersecurity within SMEs is improving. This could be achieved by  conducting regular surveys similar to the one conducted to support this report, by gathering  feedback from SMEs after a campaign has been completed, and by analysis reports of  cybercrime incidents to law enforcement agencies, Computer Emergency Response Teams  (CERTs), and Data Protection Supervisory Authorities  CYBERSECURITY FOR SMES  June 2021  50  Note: This type of training is different from the one mentioned in section 5.1.3. The desired  results after the implementation of this recommendation is the increase in the awareness  regarding cybersecurity within the SME sector in general.  6.2 PROVIDE TARGETED GUIDELINES AND TEMPLATES  It has been pointed out from the contributions to the online survey and  the subsequent follow up interviews that there are many generically  written guides in relation to cybersecurity, such as cybersecurity  standards and relevant laws and regulations, which outline what should  be done. For example, the EU General Data Protection Regulation  states in Article 3268 that:  “Taking into account the state of the art, the costs of implementation  and the nature, scope, context and purposes of processing as well as  the risk of varying likelihood and severity for the rights and freedoms of  natural persons, the controller and the processor shall implement  appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of  security appropriate to the risk…”.  Although the meaning of this requirement is clear, the implementation path for an SME with  limited resources and knowledge on cybersecurity is anything but clear.  As most SMEs are not aware of either specific standards or methods and techniques for  implementing security and privacy measures, easy to use, clear and structured implementation  guidelines, plans, procedures, and exercises should be developed to assist SMEs bridge this  gap.  Good practices handbooks including realistic and specific examples, simple terms and easily  translatable language should be prepared. These guidelines and templates should be especially  adapted to the characteristics of SMEs and should be adaptable based on the criticality of  information processed by the SME, the industry and their dependence on ICT.  Public-private collaboration is proposed through collaboration with SME representative bodies,  appropriate public sector organizations, and, where there is no conflict of interest, cybersecurity  companies for the better definition and content of these guidelines, exercises, procedures,  handbooks and standards.  6.3 CREATE SME FOCUSED CYBERSECURITY STANDARDS  A standard is a document designed to be used as a rule, guideline or  definition. It is a consensus-built, repeatable way of doing something.  Standards are created by bringing together all interested parties such as  manufacturers, consumers and regulators of a particular material,  product, process or service69. However, SMEs often have a minority  contribution in these standardization efforts and the resulting work rarely  makes specific provisions for SMEs.  There are many existing standards for cybersecurity, which are not adopted by SMEs. There  are various reasons why this may be the case. Primarily due to the fact that cybersecurity  standards are suitable for larger organizations and not SMEs. However, this should not  68 https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2016/679/oj  69 https://www.cen.eu/work/ENdev/whatisEN/Pages/default.aspx  https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2016/679/oj https://www.cen.eu/work/ENdev/whatisEN/Pages/default.aspx  CYBERSECURITY FOR SMES  June 2021  51  necessarily be the case. SMEs should be encouraged to adopt cybersecurity standards.  Tailored guidance and implementation guides for SMEs on how to adopt these existing  cybersecurity standards should be created.  In addition, it is important that good practices and guidelines are created and published for  cybersecurity and that they are developed based on the needs of SMEs. Participation of SMEs  in all stages of the standards’ lifecycle must be ensured, from their participation in  standardization committees to the final standard use and adoption. Standards focused primarily  on SMEs, similar to the Cyber Essentials, should be considered.70  Furthermore, SMEs are reminded that adhering to cybersecurity standards, while it is a positive  measure in improving the cybersecurity for the organization, it is no guarantee that systems are  100% secure. Cybersecurity standards are a means to manage the risk related to cybersecurity  but do not eliminate that risk.  The Belgian guide for SMEs71 includes basic but also advanced measures to enable SMEs to  improve their cybersecurity levels, reduce cybersecurity risks, mitigate vulnerabilities and  improve their resilience.  6.4 BOLSTER USE OF RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORKS  Throughout this document, various risks related to cybersecurity have  been presented. Each organization (small or large) has to identify,  assess and evaluate these risks, decide on based on their business  requirements how they will manage those risks. This process is known  as Risk Management and presents a crucial decision making tool that  can be fitted to every organization including SMEs.  There is a huge variety of standards, tools, methodologies and techniques that could be used to  identify key cybersecurity risks. Many of these tools are outlined in the ENISA “Inventory of Risk  Management/Risk Assessment Methods & Tools72”.  However, in many cases there is a lack of  simplified and practical risk management solutions aimed at the SME sector.  Risk Management frameworks that are practical, easy to understand, easy to translate to  business terms, easy to implement without specialized knowledge, and scalable to SMEs need  to be designed and promoted. Similar to the Dutch VNO-NCW Cyber Risk guide for SMEs73.  Promoting the use of these risk frameworks and providing instructions on how to apply them  should be encouraged by Member States.  70 https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/cyberessentials/overview  71 https://ccb.belgium.be/en/document/guide-sme  72 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/threat-risk-management/risk-management/current-risk/risk-management-inventory  73 https://www.vno-ncw.nl/standpunten/cybersecurity  https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/cyberessentials/overview https://ccb.belgium.be/en/document/guide-sme https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/threat-risk-management/risk-management/current-risk/risk-management-inventory https://www.vno-ncw.nl/standpunten/cybersecurity  CYBERSECURITY FOR SMES  June 2021  52  EBIOS (Expression des Besoins et Identification des Objectifs de Sécurité - Expression of  Needs and Identification of Security Objectives) is a method for analysis, evaluation and action  on risks relating to information systems. It generates a security policy adapted to the needs of  an organization. The method was created in 1995 and is now maintained by the ANSSI, a  department of the French Prime Minister.  The IT baseline protection (German: IT-Grundschutz)74 approach from the German Federal  Office for Information Security (BSI) is a methodology to identify and implement computer  security measures in an organization. The aim is the achievement of an adequate and  appropriate level of security for IT systems. To reach this goal the BSI recommends \"well-  proven technical, organizational, personnel, and infrastructural safeguards\".  MONARC (Method for Optimised Analysis of Risk CASES) of the Ministry of Economy in  Luxembourg. The advantage of MONARC lies in the capitalisation of risk analysis already  performed in similar business contexts: the same vulnerabilities regularly appear in many  businesses, as they face the same threats and generate similar risks. Most companies have  servers, printers, a fleet of smartphones, Wi-Fi antennas, etc. Therefore, the vulnerabilities  and threats are the same. Thus. it is sufficient to generalise risk scenarios for these assets  (also called objects) by context and/or business.  6.5 MAKE CYBERSECURITY AFFORDABLE  As mentioned in the Challenges section, cybersecurity bears a cost for  organizations and in particular for SMEs who due to lack of  understanding or awareness may not budget appropriately for  cybersecurity solutions. These costs can relate to the purchasing of  cybersecurity products, services, external consulting service, and other  related costs. These costs may play the leading role in the decision  whether or not to implement cybersecurity measures and to which  extent.  The vast majority of the participants in this survey highlighted that they need help in this area. It  is recommended, that the relevant bodies in Member States consider assisting SMEs in this  area by implementing any of the following actions:   Improving access to competent cybersecurity advice or guidelines.   Providing funding for the strengthening of the SMEs cybersecurity posture.   Providing tools to lower the cybersecurity solutions price per SME (using more  effective procurement methods and systems, pooling demand75, etc.)  For example many SMEs (in particular the smaller ones) use cloud services, which are  managed by the provider under standard contract clauses and fixed Service Level Agreements  (SLAs). Individual SMEs due to their size have no advantage or ability to negotiate suitable  SLAs, something which larger organizations may be able to do so.  In larger numbers, SMEs  might develop customized SLAs or contract clauses to fit better their cybersecurity needs.  74 https://www.bsi.bund.de/DE/Themen/Unternehmen-und-Organisationen/Standards-und-Zertifizierung/IT-Grundschutz/it- grundschutz_node.html  75 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pooling_(resource_management)  https://www.ssi.gouv.fr/en/ https://www.bsi.bund.de/ https://www.bsi.bund.de/ https://www.bsi.bund.de/DE/Themen/Unternehmen-und-Organisationen/Standards-und-Zertifizierung/IT-Grundschutz/it-grundschutz_node.html https://www.bsi.bund.de/DE/Themen/Unternehmen-und-Organisationen/Standards-und-Zertifizierung/IT-Grundschutz/it-grundschutz_node.html https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pooling_(resource_management)  CYBERSECURITY FOR SMES  June 2021  53  6.6 PROMOTE THE CREATION OF ISACS  Information Sharing and Analysis Centers (ISACs)76 are important  instruments to ensure close cooperation between public and private  stakeholders within different business sectors. ISACs are non for profit  organizations set up within a business sector or focusing on a common  theme for various businesses to enable those businesses to share  experiences regarding cybersecurity. This could be advice on best  practises for those who are members of the ISAC on how to deal with  cybersecurity issues, providing warnings relating to cybersecurity issues  specific to the ISAC, and guidelines and best practises on how to  manage cybersecurity.  Participation of SMEs in ISACs could greatly enhance the SMEs cybersecurity posture,  particularly if the ISAC is aimed at the SME sector, or can facilitate the cybersecurity concerns  specific to SMEs. ENISA has done substantial work on the topic of ISACs to identify the  different ISAC models in Europe through the report on Cooperative Models on ISACs77.  Moreover, ENISA recently published the ISAC in a BOX78, an online toolkit created around a  lifecycle of building, running, evaluating and developing phases and each phase includes  information, activities, documents, tools for setting up and running an ISAC. There is also  available from ENISA the report on “Public Private Partnerships (PPP) - Cooperative models”79  which Member States can refer to when designing the appropriate ISACs.  76 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/national-cyber-security-strategies/information-sharing  77 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/information-sharing-and-analysis-center-isacs-cooperative-models  78 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/national-cyber-security-strategies/information-sharing/isacs-toolkit/view  79 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/public-private-partnerships-ppp-cooperative-models  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/national-cyber-security-strategies/information-sharing https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/information-sharing-and-analysis-center-isacs-cooperative-models https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/national-cyber-security-strategies/information-sharing/isacs-toolkit/view https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/public-private-partnerships-ppp-cooperative-models  CYBERSECURITY FOR SMES  June 2021  54  A  ANNEX: METHODOLOGY  A.1 SMES IN EU  According to the latest (November 2019) ANNUAL REPORT ON EUROPEAN SMEs 2018/2019  of the European Commission80:   There were slightly more than 25 million SMEs in the EU-28 in 2018, of which 93%  were micro SMEs. SMEs accounted for 99.8% of all enterprises in the EU-28  nonfinancial business sector (NFBS), generating 56.4% of NFBS value added and  66.6%of NFBS employment. Overall, the NFBS represented 54.5% of EU-28 GDP and  61.4% of total EU-28 employment.   Micro SMEs are by far the most common type of SME, accounting for 93.0% of all  enterprises and 93.2%6 of all SMEs in the NFBS. However, micro SMEs accounted for  only 29.7% of total employment in the NFBS, while small and medium-sized SMEs  accounted respectively for 20.1% and 16.8% of total NFBS employment.  To help in the extraction of information on cybersecurity in SMEs, a predefined set of industry  sectors was utilised. The industry sectors used were derived from the Annual Report on  European SMEs 2018/2019 and the NACE Rev. 2 statistical classification of economic activities  in the European Community81  Table A.1: Industry sections and descriptions  Industry section Brief Description  Accommodation  and food service  activities  This section includes the provision of short-stay accommodation for visitors  and other travellers and the provision of complete meals and drinks fit for  immediate consumption.

Even before the pandemic crisis, there were a number of available recommendations regarding  the design and implementation of cybersecurity measures in organizations – some of them  focused on SMEs. During the desktop research, such publications were systematically sought,  identified, and analysed.  After the review of these publications, the project team was able to identify the documents that  provided insight into the challenges faced by SMEs in their cybersecurity endeavours and the  associated recommendations.  The results of the desktop review were consolidated, categorized, and a table was created  containing the categories of challenges and recommendations identified by each relevant  document. This table is not included in this report (because of size limitations), but was used in  two different ways within this study:   The most predominant results were simplified and were used in the construction of the  content of the online survey.   The quantified information was one of the influencing factors in the selection of the  recommendations presented in sections 4 and 5 of the report.  Note: The recommendations reviewed covered technical, organizational, and policy  recommendations, including recommendations towards relevant national and European  authorities.  CYBERSECURITY FOR SMES  June 2021  57  Analysis of Phase I(b): Survey  An online survey was conducted in the period between July and September 2020 in which 249  SMEs participated. In order to promote the survey and make sure that there was an adequate  degree of participation several different channels of communication were selected (the ENISA  website, social media, direct contacts with various stakeholders in various member states,  relevant European funded projects etc).  The results of the online survey are analysed in Sections 2, 3 and 4.  The online survey provided a lot of information regarding the challenges and the  recommendations for cybersecurity, but in order to achieve the objectives of this study, it was  critical to have access to the perceptive of the SMEs regarding their actual value and  practicality.  In order to collect these opinions, the structure of the survey was as follows:  Section A – Information regarding the participating organization  Purpose: Gather general (demographic) information regarding the SME in order to make sure  that they should be included in the survey (valid replies) and be able to extract some  conclusions based on industry, country, size etc.  Section B - The role of ICT  Purpose: Gather information on the technology knowledge and dependence of the organization  to computers and the internet as well as the perceived criticality and sensitivity of information  processed by the organization. These parameters together would show the impact of a possible  cybersecurity incident to the organization (in terms of operation and legal compliance).  Furthermore, information derived from this study would show whether there is a difference in the  cybersecurity posture of the SMEs based on the organization’s dependence to computers and  the internet and the criticality of the information processed.  Section C – Security measures implemented  Purpose: This section gathered information regarding the security technologies and controls  implemented before and after the COVID-19 pandemic. The results to these questions would  allow for conclusions regarding the security level of the SMEs before and after the COVID-19  pandemic.  The security technologies and controls examined are presented in the following Tables A.4 &  A.5.

Business  continuity and  Disaster recovery  plan  A business continuity plan (BCP) is a document that outlines how a business  will continue operating during an unplanned disruption in service. A disaster  recovery plan (DRP) is a documented, structured approach that describes how  an organization can quickly resume work after an unplanned incident. A DRP is  an essential part of a business continuity plan (BCP). It is applied to the aspects  of an organization that depend on a functioning IT infrastructure.  CYBERSECURITY FOR SMES  June 2021  60  Section D – Cybersecurity Incidents, challenges and proposals  Purpose: Within this section, information regarding cybersecurity incidents, challenges, and  recommendations were requested. An analysis of the answers regarding a cybersecurity  incident could provide conclusions regarding the rate of cybersecurity incidents in SMEs, the  origin of the cybersecurity incidents, the possible correlation between the cybersecurity  incidents, and the implemented measures, as well as the measures implemented after these  incidents. An analysis of the challenges faced and proposals for action would provide a gravity  factor, which, when correlated with the results of the desktop research, would enable a more  realistic set of recommendations to be provided for SMEs.  Section E – Further involvement  Purpose: The results of the online survey and the final results of this study were planned to be  further validated through various methods. In this section, the help of the participants was  solicited. The information of the participants would only be used only in this part of the study for  the development of recommendations for actions and in accordance to the ENISA privacy policy.  Analysis of Phase I(c): Interviews  After the publication of the survey, at specific checkpoints, the results of the online survey were  monitored and when the ¾ checkpoint was reached, the first preliminary analysis was  conducted. This analysis contained all information and correlations mentioned above and led to  the compilation of an initial set of cybersecurity challenges and recommendations by the SMEs.  To further validate these preliminary results, structured interviews were planned and conducted.  The participants in these interviews were selected from the volunteers of the online survey. The  interview participants were selected based on the industry, the country, and the type of SME,  they were involved in. To facilitate the interviews, a customized questionnaire was created. The  questions covered all the areas mentioned in the survey and focused on   Which were (if any) the changes regarding cybersecurity posture brought by the  pandemic.   Which are the challenges an SME is facing regarding cybersecurity.   Which recommendations towards European / Country / Regional government could  have value to the SMEs.   Which measures affecting the SMEs themselves could be practically applicable.  The results of the interviews were collected, analysed, consolidated, and correlated with those  collected through the desktop research and the online survey. The result is presented in  Sections 4 and 5.  A.2.2 Phase II: Extraction of Results  The second phase (Phase II) of the study was based on the qualitative analysis of the findings  and the development of recommendations in two discrete axes:   Cybersecurity recommendations for SMEs   Proposals for actions to Regional, National and European authorities, to support the  SMEs in strengthening their Cybersecurity posture.  A.2.3 Phase III: Report Validation  The draft version of this study was shared with an extended ecosystem of stakeholders in order  to validate the results. This ecosystem included representatives of the SMEs participating in  both the online survey and the interviews, the ENISA National Liaison Officers network, the  National Cybersecurity Strategies Group and ENISA subject matter experts. A final validation  stage was carried out by conducting a validation workshop organized by ENISA.

It has been helping the  European market to stay competitive, improve the quality and quantity of jobs, and continue to  support the European way of life. The impact of our research and innovation depends on the  capacity of our economies to become more knowledge-oriented and innovation-driven and  invest enough resources in addressing the most important challenges and exploiting the right  framework conditions to stimulate innovation.  The European Union Agency for Cybersecurity has identified key research and innovation  topics in cybersecurity to address specific strategic objectives: in 2018 the goal was to make the  EU more cybersecure (1). In this document – the second in the series – the objective is to  support the EU’s digital strategic autonomy.  The term ‘digital strategic autonomy’ can have different meanings in different contexts. In this  report, it is defined as the ability of Europe (2) to source products and services that meet its  needs and values, without undue influence from the outside world.  This mission-driven roadmap presents seven prioritised challenges to support research,  development and innovation in relation to the EU’s digital strategic autonomy. These priorities  were derived from a set of 17 topics, which in turn were extracted and synthesised from recent  research roadmaps. To finalise these priorities, an open survey took place, which was  completed by 94 members of the European cybersecurity research and industrial community.  For each of these seven priorities, this document (i) explores the origins of the problem and its  importance, (ii) describes the state of the art and the long-term objective of the topic and (iii)  recommends the necessary steps to reach this long-term objective.  The open consultation revealed that the highest priority is related to data security, with an  emphasis on privacy, data protection, trust in algorithms and artificial intelligence. The most  important research and innovation challenges also include software and hardware security,  digital communications security, cryptography, and detection of and response to  cyberattacks. Finally, user-centric aspects related to the overall acceptance of digital  services, including understanding the consequences of decisions to enforce or bypass security  mechanisms, is a knowledge area that should be included in future research.  Based on our findings, digital strategic autonomy will require an overarching vision of the  information and communications technology landscape, driven by ambitious policies that aim to  (i) protect European values and (ii) satisfy European needs for advanced and resilient services.

INTRODUCTION  The focus of this work is to identify the necessary research priorities to support the EU’s digital  strategic autonomy and thus digital sovereignty. In this introductory chapter, we (i) analyse how  the terms ‘digital strategic autonomy’ and ‘digital sovereignty’ have been used and propose the  definition used in this report, (ii) define the scope and target audience, and (iii) outline the  structure of the report.  1.1. DEFINITION OF DIGITAL STRATEGIC AUTONOMY AND SOVEREIGNTY  Over the past few years, people have been increasingly using the term ‘digital sovereignty’.  During the 2018 State of the Union speech, called ‘The hour of European sovereignty’,  President Juncker argued that the time had come for the EU to start working towards ‘becoming  more autonomous and living up to our global responsibilities’ (3). The term ‘digital sovereignty’  may have different meanings in different contexts, ranging from ‘nation state sovereignty’ to  ‘personal technological sovereignty (4). These contexts extend from individual citizens to social  movements and can include entire countries. These ambitions are reflected in the revised EU  strategy on cybersecurity, which aims to ‘build greater resilience and strategic autonomy’ and  (3) Juncker, J.-C., ‘The hour of European sovereignty’, State of the Union 2018  (https://ec.europa.eu/commission/sites/beta-political/files/soteu2018-speech_en.pdf).  (4) Couture, S. and Toupin, S., ‘What does the concept of “sovereignty” mean in digital, network and technological  sovereignty?’, paper presented at GigaNet: Global Internet Governance Academic Network, Annual Symposium  2017, 2018 (http://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.3107272).  https://ec.europa.eu/commission/sites/beta-political/files/soteu2018-speech_en.pdf http://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.3107272  CYBERSECURITY RESEARCH DIRECTIONS FOR  THE EU’S DIGITAL STRATEGIC AUTONOMY  April 2021  5  which states that it is in the EU’s strategic interest to ensure that ‘the EU retains and develops  the essential capacities to secure its digital economy, society and democracy’ (5).  According to a recent European Union Agency for Cybersecurity (ENISA) consultation report (6),  European digital sovereignty can be perceived as encompassing three categories:  1. data sovereignty over the personal data of EU citizens – the personal aspect,  2. digital sovereignty of the data-driven European industry – the industry aspect,  3. digital sovereignty of the EU and EU Member States – the political aspect.  A recent strategic note of the European Political Strategy Centre (EPSC) addresses strategic  autonomy in the digital age (7). The note develops concepts related to the capability of Europe  to maintain its strategic autonomy in an environment in which digital technologies are pervasive.  Strategic autonomy can be defined as ‘the ability, in terms of capacity and capabilities, to decide  and act upon essential aspects of one’s longer-term future in the economy, society and their  institutions’ (8). Strategic autonomy enables nations – and through them the EU – to retain their  independence and authority. The note defines three dimensions: industrial, operational and  political.   The industrial dimension requires that Europe is able to fulfil its digital needs. This  aspect supports the operational capability of Europe to leverage digital technologies, to  operate its critical infrastructure and to ensure that the infrastructure is resilient to  cyberattacks. Control of this critical digital infrastructure, in turn, enables political  strategic autonomy, namely the ability to make informed decisions freely and  independently.   The operational dimension relates to the resilience of the European communication  infrastructure and information and communications technology (ICT) systems. Owing  to cascading effects, a vulnerability affecting one service in one Member State can  have significant repercussions for others and eventually Europe as a whole.   The political dimension is associated with digital sovereignty, in a manner well  described by Viviane Reding (former Vice-President of the European Commission).  She defines digital sovereignty (9) as the ‘capacity to influence norms and standards of  information technology’, which is based on the more general definition of sovereignty  as the ‘capacity to determine one’s actions and norms’ (10).  We can thus define digital strategic autonomy as the ability of Europe to source products  and services that meet its needs and values, without undue influence from the outside  world. Needs may include hardware, software or algorithms, implemented as products and/or  services. Values imply a digital ecosystem that is fair and that respects privacy and digital rights.  Sourcing denotes that a product or service is either produced in the EU and verified to conform  to our needs and values, or acquired from outside and certified to comply with our needs and  values. This concept implies that Europe needs to produce some of these products  independently and provide such services.

SCOPE AND TARGET AUDIENCE  The present study provides an analysis of the key research and innovation knowledge areas to  support the EU’s digital strategic autonomy. Digital strategic autonomy is established by  ensuring a solid capacity to develop and maintain a strong ICT industry, which in turn will lead  to strategic autonomy for Europe and its citizens. The development of ICT companies, which  should be supported by a robust research and development ecosystem, can contribute to  creating a pipeline of innovations that are developed in Europe and that are primarily designed  to meet the needs and values of European citizens.  Therefore, the main objective of this report is to identify, analyse and describe the most  important knowledge areas necessary for developing products and services that meet the EU’s  needs and values and that guarantee a resilient ICT infrastructure. Investing in these areas of  cybersecurity research and development is of paramount importance for controlling and  operating resilient ICT infrastructure without interference. Resilience to technology attacks, such  as denial of service or malware, and resilience to data attacks, such as social platform incidents,  are key components that Europe should encourage by developing and guiding the appropriate  technologies.  This research roadmap could serve policymakers in providing objective-driven strategic  guidance for defining future projects and investments in cybersecurity. The prioritised  knowledge areas could be of use in defining industrial and research policies, with the ultimate  goal of ensuring EU digital autonomy and sovereignty. Moreover, researchers could use the  research and development areas presented in this report as a guide to addressing the research  and technological challenges and reviewing the state of the art and the long-term objectives of  each priority.  1.3.  STRUCTURE  This report is organised as follows.   Chapter 2 contains a number of practical examples illustrating fictional scenarios in  which the need for digital strategic autonomy in Europe is highlighted, and what could  happen if Europe fails to maintain its digital strategic autonomy.   Chapter 3 further analyses the research and innovation knowledge areas that were  considered by the cybersecurity community to be the most significant for ensuring  European digital strategic autonomy. A comic strip and an independent scenario are  included for each prioritised research topic to improve audience engagement and help  readers adopt lateral thinking.  The seven prioritised research areas are:  1. data security,  2. trustworthy software platforms,  3. cyber threat management and response,  4. trustworthy hardware platforms,  5. cryptography,  6. user-centric security practices and tools,  7. digital communication security.   Chapter 4 includes considerations of transversal aspects that cover all research areas  and that will reinforce the European impact on cybersecurity.  EU digital strategic  autonomy is the  ability of Europe to  source products  and services,  without undue  influence from the  outside world.

It concludes with an analysis of respondents by country and by  organisation type.  CYBERSECURITY RESEARCH DIRECTIONS FOR  THE EU’S DIGITAL STRATEGIC AUTONOMY  April 2021  8  2. STRATEGIC AUTONOMY IN  EUROPE: SCENARIOS  Digital technologies have pervaded our everyday lives, to the extent that it is extremely hard to  live in their absence. In the following paragraphs, fictional – yet plausible – scenarios that could  undermine the EU’s strategic autonomy are briefly described.  Interference with navigation services. ‘A cyberattack against a navigation server generated  fake traffic causing confusion to drivers and autonomous vehicles.’ In this context, autonomy  translates to the availability of maps and associated information and obtaining access to  positioning and routing algorithms and systems, without fearing that access to these data might  be blocked or that the data are fraudulent. However, external interference (e.g. Global  Positioning System signal jamming) may affect specific activities such as military exercises (11).  The areas of  Data security and  Trustworthy software platforms are analysed in  Sections 3.1 and 3.2, respectively.  Untrusted artificial intelligence (AI). ‘Hackers found a way to poison the results of an AI  cooking app to promote specific products.’ Although interference with cooking seems to be  limited with respect to autonomy, it is an example of when one’s freedom of choice might be  altered if the recipes or ingredients received are not of interest to the recipient. Moreover, one’s  choice to buy the ingredients from a provider might be influenced by an altered e-commerce list  presented. The area of  Data security is analysed in Section 3.1.  Disruption in the medical care system. ‘A hospital became out-of-service following a  ransomware attack that rendered its digital systems unusable.’ Cyber-securing our medical  infrastructures is of great importance, especially during pandemics (such as during the  coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic), so that they are available when we need  them the most. All medical devices are seamlessly connected, to support care staff and patients  with regard to various procedures of medical care, monitoring, administering medicine,  connecting beds and rooms, and using global platforms to exchange information. Medical files  have to be available to authorised personnel to enable them to provide efficient care. However,  the high level of dependence of the medical infrastructure on ICT, and its vulnerability to  malicious code, has already been seen in the impact of ransomware, such as the WannaCry  ransomware used to attack the National Health Service in the United Kingdom (12), the  ransomware attack on the Rouen University Hospital Centre in France (13), and more recently  the ransomware attack on a hospital in Germany, which was directly linked to a death (14). The  capability to verify the absence of vulnerabilities and malicious code in the infrastructure,  software or services we procure in combination with the ability to defend systems against  cyberattacks are also important elements of autonomy. The areas of  Trustworthy software  platforms and  Cyber threat management and response are analysed in Sections 3.2 and  3.3, respectively.

Products sourced from untrusted producers may feature software or hardware  vulnerabilities or even contain backdoors that could be triggered/exploited by malicious  attackers, and thus may compromise domestic safety and people’s privacy. The areas of  Trustworthy software platforms and  Trustworthy hardware platforms are analysed in  Sections 3.2 and 3.4, respectively.  Lack of supply chain availability. ‘Lack of supply of many digital components was observed  after a manufacturer, located outside the EU, temporary halted exports because of non-  compliance with EU regulations.’ Many products and services require electronic components  and platforms. Supply chain issues may result in a lack of availability of electronic components  required by the EU industry. Without such components (e.g. processors and chips), the supply  of both personal electronic devices and elements of the digital infrastructure cannot be  guaranteed, which potentially endangers Europe’s strategic autonomy in industries that rely on  the supply of devices, such as the automotive industry. The supply chain problem is linked to  the areas of  Trustworthy software platforms and  Trustworthy hardware platforms, which  are analysed in Sections 3.2 and 3.4, respectively.  Absence of control over communication infrastructure. ‘Hackers monitored users and their  data by exploiting vulnerabilities in the new generation of mobile communications.’ The  evolution of digital communication infrastructure has been guided by standards. Europe has  been a leader in mobile telecommunication standards (e.g. the Global System for Mobile  Communications (15)) and should continue to guide coordinated secure technological advances  through leadership of standardisation to ensure its autonomy over communication infrastructure.  However, this has become increasingly challenging as the telecommunication industry  transforms from an industry based exclusively on hardware to a software- and even cloud-  based industry. The areas of  Trustworthy software platforms and  Digital communication  security are analysed in Sections 3.2 and 3.7, respectively.  Need for post-quantum secure communications. ‘Encrypted network traffic recorded today  could be broken in 10 years through the use of post-quantum computers.’ To preserve today’s  secrets for longer, the EU will have to develop post-quantum cryptography. For this reason, the  EU should opt for the adoption of and transition to post-quantum secure communication  infrastructure when needed. The area of cryptography is analysed in Section 3.5.  Lack of control over a product or system lifecycle. ‘Numerous smartphone devices are  vulnerable as they do not receive the latest security updates.’ The current best practice for  suppressing vulnerabilities in software-based systems and products after production is patching.  This process is well accepted by end users. However, the patching processes for hardware  devices (e.g. firmware updates and updates to the lower layers of the infrastructure) remain  difficult and a research topic, for example in the context of the internet of things (IoT) (16). The  patching process itself is a strategic autonomy concern. On the one hand, patch availability is  critical for protection (17) and the absence of reliable and timely patches could have an impact  on strategic autonomy. On the other hand, unverified software updates may include malicious  code that could insert backdoors (18) or introduce new vulnerabilities into the system. Controlling  patch availability and authenticity is thus critical for service operation and consequently strategic  (15) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GSM  (16) Sönnerup, J. and Karlsson, J., ‘Robust security updates for connected devices’, Master’s Thesis, Lund University,  Sweden, 2016 (http://lup.lub.lu.se/luur/download?func=downloadFile&recordOId=8841016&fileOId=8872290).

A complementary issue is assurance and certification. The areas of  Trustworthy  software platforms,  Trustworthy hardware platforms and user-centric practice and tools  are analysed in Sections 3.2, 3.4 and 3.6, respectively.  Critical infrastructure interruptions. ‘Hackers infiltrated the power grid system and took it out  of order.’ The protection of critical infrastructure against cyberattacks is of great importance, as  it is needed to preserve the EU’s autonomy. A disturbance in the operation of the healthcare  system during a pandemic, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, may put human lives in danger. In  the transport sector, our heavy reliance on guidance mechanisms could, for example,  significantly impair all transport systems, such as autonomous vehicles, trains or flights. As a  result, this may affect our safety, as accidental or malicious failures can occur. The same is true  for the energy sector. Failures in providing essential services threaten the EU economy and the  well-being of its citizens and may also cause loss of human lives. Deploying and operating self-  sufficient critical infrastructure and essential services is a key element of Europe’s digital  strategic autonomy. The areas of  Trustworthy software platforms and  Trustworthy hardware  platforms are analysed in Sections 3.2 and 3.4, respectively.  Loss of algorithmic control leading to loss of understanding of decision support  algorithms. ‘A false positive alert of an AI-powered cyberdefence system caused problems in  the internal network of the ministry.’ The United States and China are investing heavily in AI  technologies. Global companies based in the United States, such as Google, Amazon,  Facebook, Apple and Microsoft (GAFAM), and their Chinese counterparts (Baidu, Alibaba,  Tencent and Xiaomi (BATX)) are doing so to be able to fully control the technology for their own  benefit. Governing both the data and the algorithms that process it appears to be necessary to  ensure that digitalisation is beneficial to European society. However, not understanding where  the data are located, how they are protected in transit or at rest (e.g. using encryption,  anonymisation and/or access control technologies) and how they are processed raises endless  suspicions regarding the soundness of the digital society. Such concerns have been raised by  the significant amounts of evidence on social platform incidents, such as the Cambridge  Analytica data scandal (19). Europe should ensure strategic autonomy by having trustworthy and  explainable AI systems. The area of  Data security is analysed in Section 3.1.  Lack of data. ‘The application of AI systems in Europe may be limited because of data  protection regulations.’ There is a strong belief that all problems are solvable, as long as vast  amounts of data are available and can be processed by powerful algorithms. For example, the  application of AI to medical data may significantly improve diagnosis and treatment. However,  Europe has strong privacy requirements that require data to be handled according to  regulations. Controlling access to and use of data is critical to ensuring that we have enough  data available to feed algorithms (and in the end command and control systems). As a side  note, access to data (e.g. data for cyber threat intelligence) is becoming critical for cybersecurity  operations. The areas of  Data security and cyber threat management are analysed in  Sections 3.1 and 3.3, respectively.  All of the abovementioned scenarios show how activities – in many cases critical activities –  may be disrupted and, when mapping such problems on a larger scale, may affect European  citizens as a whole. To preserve Europe’s strategic autonomy, which could be affected by such  problems, we should leverage our strong research and development workforce and our societal  values to develop and provide products and services that cover the EU’s needs and meet the  EU’s values.

KEY AREAS FOR  DEVELOPING THE EU’S  DIGITAL STRATEGIC  AUTONOMY  In this chapter, the seven most important knowledge areas that were defined through  consultation with the cybersecurity community are presented. The priorities are ranked by order  of preference by the community, the highest appearing first. A full list of all the knowledge areas  is available in Section A.2.  3.1.  DATA SECURITY  3.1.1. Current and future context of data security  As shown in the abovementioned scenario, every time Alice uses her smartphone she sends  information about her current location to the cloud. Alice provides information not only when she  travels but also when she shops, when she eats and when she works, since most of the  applications and services she uses collect information about her. Unfortunately, if she does not  provide these data, she will not be able to use these applications or services. To make matters  worse, Alice often has difficulties in understanding how much information she provides, when  she provides it, and for what reason this information is being used, beyond her current needs.  As if this was not enough, the deployment of home assistant devices, which listen to and may  potentially record every private conversation, may result in constant monitoring even inside our  homes. This constant monitoring will continue to feed AI algorithms aimed at taking care of all of  our human needs, from the simplest to the most complex.  3.1.2. Definition and criticality of the problem  AI is becoming the new driver of daily and critical services, such as powering energy production  and distribution, managing multimodal transport and piloting healthcare infrastructure. Without  trusting the data and the algorithms that process it, it is hard to imagine a trustworthy future for  our digital society. The issue in question is the risk of losing control over both information and  the algorithms that process it. Although the EU has taken the initiative to protect EU citizens’  Every morning, Alice fires up her preferred navigational application on her phone to navigate from  home to work. Without thinking about it, she provides information to the system about her location and  speed. In turn, the guidance system provides her with information about road conditions and the best  itinerary to reach her destination. The application may also assist her in selecting the best time of  departure, by estimating her time of arrival. However, does Alice know what kind of personal data she  provides and how these data are being processed?  CYBERSECURITY RESEARCH DIRECTIONS FOR  THE EU’S DIGITAL STRATEGIC AUTONOMY  April 2021  12  information by enforcing the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) (20), this loss of control  might have already happened to a certain extent, since many people worldwide rely on  services provided by GAFAM or BATX for both collecting and processing data.  With respect to data, the top cloud providers (Amazon, Microsoft, Google, SalesForce) are  based outside Europe. However, there is an imminent risk in this situation, as there are national  regulations, such as the Cloud Act (21) in the United States, that may force providers to grant  access to European citizens’ data. This goes against the provisions of regulations such as the  GDPR (22), which aims to protect the personal data of EU citizens. European and Member  States initiatives exist for launching a sovereign cloud (23), but their impact remains limited at  this stage, in terms of both market penetration and scope.  With respect to algorithms, we are also becoming used to treating algorithms as a cloud  commodity; namely, a lot of machine learning code relies on one or two very popular  libraries (24). Although this is very efficient for many software developers, providers of the  libraries could potentially gain power over information about software related to machine  learning (e.g. through information on downloads and requests for support). To make matters  worse, our focus on the results of the libraries may deprive us of our capability to understand  and develop the basic technology behind such libraries. Moreover, if the suppliers discontinue  development or maintenance of the libraries for internal reasons, this may affect countless  services that have a direct dependency on the libraries.

Explainable and trustworthy AI algorithms that provide us with a clear understanding of how they are processing  data are needed.  CYBERSECURITY RESEARCH DIRECTIONS FOR  THE EU’S DIGITAL STRATEGIC AUTONOMY  April 2021  14  3.1.3. Efforts towards ensuring data security  Data protection is one of the rights enshrined in Article 8 of the EU Charter of Fundamental  Rights (25), and the introduction of the GDPR has created an obligation to protect EU personal  data. It has had a worldwide impact on countries and businesses, leading to changes in laws  and practices even outside Europe.  Several projects are tackling this aspect of the GDPR and tools related to it. For instance, the  PDP4E project (26) offers software, system engineer methods and software tools that allow  engineers to apply data protection principles in a more structured way to the projects they carry  out. The DITAS project (27) aims to provide content-based solutions to virtual data containers,  enabling secure computing at the edge. The Decode project (28) increases the digital strategic  autonomy of European citizens by enabling them to produce, access and control their data and  exchange contextualised information in real time and in a confidential and scalable manner. In  this context, ENISA has published a number of studies on the security of personal data (29) and,  in particular, cryptographic protocols and tools and their possible implementation in real-life  applications. Recently, ENISA has published new studies on security and privacy  considerations that arise from the use of autonomous agents (30) and best practice and  techniques for pseudonymisation (31). However, data security extends beyond the data  protection scheme and includes the security of any type of data in transit, in use and at rest.  Another notable European activity is the deployment of several regulatory frameworks that  formalise the needs and requirements of an EU digital economy. The recent ENISA mandate on  information technology (IT) certification schemes (32) should hopefully provide certain assurance  levels regarding digital products and services deployed in the EU, although the exact extent and  impact of this regulation remains to be evaluated.  It seems that these activities are supporting the development of privacy-aware regulations.  However, tools for managing personal data properly have not been disseminated widely, and  the security of algorithms that process data needs to be studied further.  Moreover, Europe has started to support research projects on developing technologies related  to AI (under, for example, the Horizon 2020 AI4EU (33) initiative) while making data openly  available to support the development of algorithms (e.g. through the open data pilot in Horizon  2020 and the Connecting Europe Facility (CEF) Telecom Public Open Data (34) call). Although  Europe is investing a significant amount of money in fundamental algorithms, this amount  seriously lags behind the amounts that other countries are investing.

Recommendations  To sustain and further develop its data-based digital economy, Europe should control key  technologies related to the following domains.   Understanding and mitigating vulnerabilities of AI. During sensing or processing,  machine learning algorithms are vulnerable to attacks (35); these are widely known in  the community and have also been demonstrated. The EU should invest in  technologies to prevent, detect and mitigate the impact of algorithmic vulnerabilities,  particularly in the context of control systems used in critical infrastructure.   Ensuring the availability of machine learning and big data platforms that are  sourced, hosted and sustainable in Europe. Europe should develop and encourage  sustainable AI platforms that (i) are always available, (ii) are easily accessible and (iii)  provide alternatives for EU-based services.   Developing new technologies for data security and privacy, to support advances  in regulations and the emerging needs of the digital society. As data are  becoming an active component of command and control processes, new techniques  should be developed to protect active data, regardless of syntax, semantics and  location. This includes, for example, computing on encrypted data, including multiparty  computation, functional encryption and somewhat homomorphic encryption (see  Section 3.5 for further details). The EU should invest, in particular, in technologies  favouring local/edge AI treatment to complement the investment that has already been  made in cloud-based treatment. This includes an increased focus on local AI agents,  namely developing methods and tools to support privacy-friendly global training,  deployment to edge and local execution of the AI algorithms – to the extent that this is  feasible.   Explainable AI. In many cases, AI algorithms are acting as a black box. For greater  social acceptance and technical certification purposes, it will become necessary to  trace the processes by which the algorithms reach a decision and explain these  processes to the user in an understandable manner. This extends to AI algorithms  training, and it may be combined with AI to protect the privacy of training data and user  data, as well as the model, although the latter is rather difficult to achieve. In addition,  providing open tools so that users can verify AI externally could support trustworthy AI  development and deployment. Such tools would be able to evaluate the AI by  executing built-in tests, in a similar way to how penetration testing tools work (such as  Metasploit).   Securing decision support and actuating. AI algorithms provide decisions based on  input data. An effort should be made to ensure secure sensing, in conjunction with  secure hardware (Section 3.4), secure actuating, and secure operating systems and  middleware (Section 3.2).   Social trustworthiness of AI. Current social networks exhibit many biases, without  the user being aware or conscious of them (36). Although the modern press has been  cross-checking facts to a greater extent, it does not meet the need to validate content  for correctness or appropriateness. The EU should support new techniques for  developing the trustworthiness of social online interactions, independently of the  service or platform.

Europe should  invest in  transparent,  trustworthy  information  processing for  its citizens and  businesses  regarding data  security.  CYBERSECURITY RESEARCH DIRECTIONS FOR  THE EU’S DIGITAL STRATEGIC AUTONOMY  April 2021  16  3.1.5. Long-term objectives  Data security needs to go beyond data at rest in the long term, protecting active data in an  environment without borders and well-defined lines. Data security also includes algorithms such  as AI and machine learning algorithms. Active data protection should cover information and  algorithms, from sensing to acting. Transparency provided by clarity of purpose, process and  result will increase trust and use. Success will lead to Europe establishing transparent,  trustworthy information processing for its citizens and businesses.  3.2.  TRUSTWORTHY SOFTWARE PLATFORMS  3.2.1. Current and future context of trustworthy software platforms  Software is progressively penetrating all aspects of everyday life, from the smallest objects  (such as light bulbs) to the most complex ones (for example vehicles). As demonstrated by the  abovementioned scenario, essential software, trusted to fulfil daily needs – such as the  operating system in Bob’s car – may be compromised for various reasons, betraying the user’s  trust. In this scenario, Bob may no longer be able to operate his car safely if he installs  questionable code.  Software is at the heart of digital infrastructure, and nowadays with the DevOps paradigm it is  being put into production almost at the same time as it is being written. New software  development paradigms such as Agile and SCRUM are entering the critical infrastructure  domain (37). Vulnerabilities in these environments may have terrible cascading effects. As proof,  a recent set of 11 vulnerabilities touching the VxWorks real-time operating system and reaching  the maximum severity level has affected many industrial control systems (ICS) vendors (38). This  is only one example from roughly 15 000 software vulnerabilities published yearly in the  Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) repository (39).  Although quite a number of new operating systems, virtualisation platforms and middleware  systems have been developed and introduced in the past few years (such as Android,  OpenStack), only very few of them have a European origin. Platforms such as the RIOT  operating system (40) remain confidential and are for research use only. Although many global  European companies develop software and integrate it into their systems, the number of world-  class software vendors headquartered in Europe is scarce.  3.2.2. Problem definition and criticality  With the introduction of computing and communication abilities in the majority of items utilised  daily, Europe may become vulnerable to supply chain disruptions. For instance, Google has  partially suspended business with China; it is no longer providing services for Huawei, except  for those publicly available via open licence sourcing (41). It is not clear how Europe will respond  (37) Kasauli, R., Knauss, E., Kanagwa, B., Nilsson, A. and Calikli, G., ‘Safety-critical systems and agile development: A  mapping study’, paper presented at the 44th Euromicro Conference on Software Engineering and Advanced  Applications (SEAA), Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, 3 August 2018, pp. 470-477  (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1807.07800.pdf).

A new operating system software update is  available! The vehicle starts downloading the update and attempts to install it.

Indeed,  responding to such an event requires significant effort and might introduce large additional  costs. We are at a point where, despite the noteworthy number of software developers and  software companies residing in Europe, we cannot ensure that we will be able to replace  essential software components should the ones currently deployed become unavailable.  Software is increasingly consumed as a cloud service. However, as previously noted, the major  cloud platforms are located outside Europe. This creates several problems. First, such vendors  may restrict the availability of their software services to their own clouds only, creating lock-ins  for both functionalities and data. Second, they could also prohibit third-party software vendors  from creating native software services on their cloud platforms. If Europe were to lose access to  these cloud platforms, it would consequently lose access to the software services that are  exclusive to them.  Furthermore, systems and services rely on third-party libraries and services that are  independent and beyond the control of the software developers. As an example, even a major  software vendor such as SAP today controls only a small portion of the source code in its  products and relies on open-source software for over 90 % of its products’ functionality; it is  therefore developing tools for vulnerability management of this external software (42).  3.2.3. Efforts towards establishing trustworthy software platforms  Many initiatives have taken place in Europe with the aim of publishing and supporting open-  source platforms. However, some of these initiatives have failed; the Mandriva Linux  distribution, for example, failed as the company supporting it went bankrupt a few years ago.  The most popular Linux distribution providing commercial support is currently the Red Hat  Enterprise Linux, whose headquarters are located outside the EU, followed by the SUSE Linux,  which is supported by SUSE, a company based in Germany. The mF2C project (43) has set the  goal of designing an open, secure, decentralised, multi-stakeholder management framework,  including novel programming models, privacy and security, data storage techniques, service  creation, brokerage solutions, service-level agreement (SLA) policies and resource  orchestration methods.  In effect, although Europe has a booming ICT service industry, it hosts only a few of the top  commercial software companies and supports relatively few open-source software distributions.  This is creating a potential supply chain issue, as Europe may not have a sufficient expert  workforce and enough companies to develop software solutions to meet its needs.  3.2.4. Recommendations  Europe must be able to develop its own software platforms and tools to adequately verify  software that is sourced from outside its borders. Likewise, Europe should support, promote and  host, inside its borders, open-source alternatives to commercial products, to be able to cope in  the event of supply chain disruption. Finally, as the demand for cloud services grows, Europe  must ensure an open and secure European cloud software services market.  (42) https://projects.eclipse.org/proposals/eclipse-steady  (43) https://www.mf2c-project.eu/  https://projects.eclipse.org/proposals/eclipse-steady https://www.mf2c-project.eu/  CYBERSECURITY RESEARCH DIRECTIONS FOR  THE EU’S DIGITAL STRATEGIC AUTONOMY  April 2021  18  More specific action items include the following:   Trustworthy operating systems. Europe should ensure that it maintains its expertise  on operating systems development, even if the scope is limited to specific  environments, such as cyber physical systems and secure components. It should  encourage the emergence of open-source alternatives for servers, desktops and  mobile devices.   Trustworthy middleware. Nowadays, software systems rely on third-party libraries  and services that are independent and beyond the control of software developers.  Europe needs to be able to validate these third-party libraries and services to ensure  that they do not introduce additional software vulnerabilities into the system (44).   Detection of malware and botnets. Particularly for sensitive environments such as  governmental systems and critical infrastructure, Europe needs to maintain the  capability (in terms of both expertise and tooling) to detect malware and malicious  network activity.   System and virtualisation security. As virtual environments gain in popularity and  become commodities, Europe must retain the capability to specify and enforce  cybersecurity properties in hypervisors. This is linked to cybersecurity aspects of  network operating systems and routing equipment, which are described in Section 3.7.   Secure software development platforms. Europe should maintain the capability to  develop, assess and certify secure software, possibly built from several third-party  sources. This includes (i) the capability to build secure software systems and (ii) the  ability to ensure that the systems that are built meet specific security requirements.  This depends on ‘trustworthy middleware’, which can help ensure that third-party  libraries and services are also secure.   Risk assessment platforms. To ensure the security of complex ICT systems, there is  a need to assess the risks of potential attacks, in order to define the necessary  countermeasures during both design time and runtime. Measuring the achieved level  of security is a difficult task. This task also includes assessing the dependencies on the  system (both software and hardware).   Trustworthy sensors. Software platforms should support secure command and  control infrastructure that cooperates with hardware-based sensing and actuating  (Section 3.4), as well as AI-based decision support (Section 3.1). This could be a  component of secure software and configuration updates.   Open-cloud software services. Europe needs to create an open market for cloud  software services and enable the same cloud services to be available across different  cloud providers. This would protect Europeans from being locked in to a particular  cloud service, enable European software vendors to offer cloud services and protect  Europe from losing access to critical software services should certain clouds become  unavailable.

One of the defence measures against social engineering attacks is raising people’s awareness.  CYBERSECURITY RESEARCH DIRECTIONS FOR  THE EU’S DIGITAL STRATEGIC AUTONOMY  April 2021  20  3.2.5. Long-term objective  The long-term objective of trustworthy software platforms is to ensure that deployed software is  of sufficient quality and is developed following the ‘secure-by-design’ and ‘secure-by-default’  principles. The EU should facilitate not only the development of methods and tools for  accomplishing this goal but also the development of training programmes for skilled software  developers. Of course, the security properties of these trustworthy platforms should be  maintained during the whole lifecycle of the products and services into which they are  integrated, at a time when the lifetime of embedded systems is increasing significantly. These  actions could be supported by enhanced assessment and certification methodologies for  specific application scenarios (45).  3.3.  CYBER THREAT MANAGEMENT AND RESPONSE  3.3.1. Current and future context of cyber threat management and  response  In the abovementioned scenario, malware tricked the user and was used to gain access to the  internal network of the company. Such malicious actions may cause extensive damage to  company assets, such as loss of data due to the encryption of a hard drive, when the assets are  not protected and the SOC is not prepared to respond to such a cyber-incident.  The area of operational security, also known as incident management, started in the early  1980s, with the understanding that completely secure systems were not achievable, at least not  at a reasonable cost and while allowing ease of use. The concept of an intrusion detection  system (46) that is able to detect malicious behaviours (such as malicious code or activities) has  evolved over the years.  The tools have evolved rapidly since the late 1990s into large platforms that combine a number  of technologies. Security information and event management (SIEM) platforms collect events  from many sensors and help operators classify alerts and evaluate the associated risk. Security  orchestration, automation and response (SOAR) platforms augment the capabilities of SIEM  platforms with regard to automation and response.  3.3.2. Problem definition and criticality  During the past 20 years, there has been a significant development of tools for intrusion  detection. However, the difficulty of deploying and operating these tools has led to the  (45) Baseline security recommendations have been developed by ENISA. For example, for IoT devices, see ENISA,  Baseline Security Recommendations for IoT, 2017 (https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/baseline-security- recommendations-for-iot).  (46) Denning, D. E., ‘An intrusion-detection model’, IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering, No 2, 1987, pp. 222– 232.  Claire arrives at work and logs in to the computer system. She receives an email from her boss, with a  document attached. Without realising that the email address subtly mimics the one from her boss, she  opens the document. Unknown to her, the document contains malware that infects her computer and  starts scanning the network surroundings. By finding shared folders and a vulnerable Active Directory  server, the malware gains administrative access to the system and starts encrypting the Active  Directory server’s hard drive. In the Security Operations Centre (SOC), alarms start flashing as  machines and network connectivity go down. What will the operator do to remediate the situation?  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/baseline-security-recommendations-for-iot https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/baseline-security-recommendations-for-iot  CYBERSECURITY RESEARCH DIRECTIONS FOR  THE EU’S DIGITAL STRATEGIC AUTONOMY  April 2021  21  emergence of SOCs as managed security services to facilitate deployment and operations for  organisations that do not have the skills and funds to deploy such services.  At the same time, legislation such as the Network and Information Security (NIS) Directive (47)  and its national implementations require that critical infrastructure operators report cybersecurity  incidents to the authorities and inform their peers through Information Sharing and Analysis  Centres (ISACs). Europe needs to preserve and develop the ability to design and deploy EU-  designed detection sensors in its most critical infrastructure. It also needs to preserve its ability  to design and deploy SIEM and SOAR platforms, including open-source alternatives when  commercial components cannot be sourced in Europe. These tools, and the workforce behind  them, have thus become a critical resource that is fragmented by the variety and number of  environments in which the tools must be deployed for monitoring.  The need to protect our critical infrastructure was also exposed during the COVID-19 pandemic.  This is particularly the case for our medical care infrastructure, which experienced stress as a  result of the number of patients needing treatment. The high impact that a cybersecurity incident  could have on a medical centre poses a great risk that could put even more stress on medical  care systems. Taking out a hospital’s cyber systems during a crisis could result in medical staff  losing access to patient records, medical cyber equipment being taken out of service, and  medical surgeries being halted, consequently putting human lives in danger.  Although the challenge is encountered worldwide, operating SOCs is a strategic autonomy  issue, as it depends on people and processes. With respect to people, Europe appears to suffer  from a significant shortage of a skilled workforce to operate SOCs and manage cybersecurity  incidents. Unfortunately, a delay in diagnosis and response may result in attackers (i)  penetrating systems more easily, (ii) residing inside the systems for longer periods of time and  (iii) being able to inflict significant damage. With respect to processes, SOCs handle vast  amounts of log and trace data, possibly containing very sensitive information on EU companies  and citizens. Processing these data locally and sharing information among well-identified circles  of trust for mitigating cyber threats, in compliance with the applicable EU regulatory frameworks,  is also an asset that needs to be protected.  3.3.3. Efforts towards ensuring cyber threat management and response  Research on cyberattack detection and mitigation has been, and is still, a hot topic because of  the mutations of attacks. New tools and new detection and correlation mechanisms are required  to respond to the increasing complexity of attacks.  At the same time, the digitalisation of society is introducing digital controls in many new places.  As a result, attackers have more possibilities of gaining easy access, as product designers tend  to focus more on functionality and less on security. This is demonstrated by, for example, the  fact that, from 2017 to 2018, 80 % of the vulnerabilities found in medical devices were exploiting  network access and 40 % could be triggered remotely with basic skills and no particular  privileges (48). Consequently, although there has been significant progress, in terms of both  technology and regulations, a significant gap between attackers and defenders remains,  especially in certain sectors.  (47) https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/nis-directive  (48) Debar, H., Vulnerabilities in the Internet of Medical Things, FOSAD, 2019.  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/nis-directive  CYBERSECURITY RESEARCH DIRECTIONS FOR  THE EU’S DIGITAL STRATEGIC AUTONOMY  April 2021  22  Several research projects have addressed the issue of SOCs and SIEM platforms. The DiSIEM  project (49) aims to extend existing SIEM platforms by providing a set of diversity-related  components to improve their capacities. The Cyber-Trust project (50) aims to develop an  innovative cyber threat intelligence gathering, detection and mitigation platform to tackle the  grand challenges of securing the ecosystem of IoT devices. The ReAct project (51) aims to fight  software exploitation and mitigate advanced cybersecurity threats in a timely fashion.  Although the sector of cyber threat management and response has made significant progress,  the effectiveness of attack detection and mitigation remains plagued by a large volume of false  alerts (reducing SOC effectiveness) and undetected advanced persistent threats. New solutions  are needed to support defenders who have to deal with the increasing number and complexity  of attacks.

Recommendations  Europe must be able to develop its own tools and methods for attack detection and response to  incidents in order to be able to resist and mitigate cyberattacks. The development of new  devices and new services is creating new vulnerabilities and attack paths, for which we may not  have the right detection mechanisms. Industrial control systems are going online and creating  new attack scenarios that have not been considered before. This capability is increasingly  important when facing nation state actors or handling systemic threats. Specific action items  include the following.   Cyber threat intelligence. Europe has invested a significant amount of effort in cyber  threat intelligence, for example the Malware Information Sharing Platform (52) and the  OpenCTI (53) open-source software. These efforts should be sustained to ensure that  Europe is able to influence standards currently under development at the Internet  Engineering Task Force (IETF) or the European Telecommunications Standards  Institute (ETSI).   Cybersecurity analytics. The wealth of information acquired in SOCs remains  enormous, posing a significant challenge to operators. New cybersecurity analytic tools  leveraging machine learning, AI and visualisation should support operators in  assessing and triaging alerts quickly and efficiently, thus improving the response.   Situational awareness. Given the complexity and diversity of current IT systems,  SIEM and SOAR platforms should be extended to offer operators a complete view of  the situation. This aspect also includes developing methods to raise the awareness  and improve the training of operators, to enable them to keep up with the threats. New  data streams, coming from, for example, ISACs, will also assist operators to become  acquainted with the application sector view.   Attack detection, mitigation and response. Current sensors may suffer from false  positives and false negatives and therefore may not detect multiple cyberattacks  effectively. Furthermore, many new platforms do not include endpoint protection (such  as smartphones), and thus are missing detection and mitigation capabilities. The  impact of and response to cyberattacks, from a technical, legal, business and human  standpoint, requires further study. Automated response procedures should be further  examined regarding technical feasibility and possible legal implications. Moreover,  strategies regarding incident response that require the cooperation of several  stakeholders with different levels of administrative control should be developed. These  strategies could take into account several utility functions.   Deception. Although use of the word ‘honeypot’ has decreased in recent years, new  deception techniques could be developed and prove to be effective at triggering alerts  related to malicious activity and protecting legitimate systems from exposure. This area  could include exploring adversarial machine learning techniques to learn more about  attackers leveraging AI tools to deploy advanced attack schemes.   Cyber defence. It has already been demonstrated that critical infrastructure could  suffer greatly from heavy attacks; therefore, it is necessary to think ahead and plan  protection mechanisms and operating modes that enable the infrastructure to ‘fail  gracefully’ and operate in the best possible manner in a degraded or even manual  mode.   Post-design and post-perimeter defence and response strategies. The perimeter  of many of our organisations is becoming increasingly vague as practices such as  (52) Malware Information Sharing Platform (https://www.misp-project.org/).  (53) OpenCTI – open cyber threat intelligence platform (https://www.opencti.io/en/).  Europe should  develop its own  tools and  methods for  attack detection  and incident  response.  https://www.misp-project.org/ https://www.opencti.io/en/  CYBERSECURITY RESEARCH DIRECTIONS FOR  THE EU’S DIGITAL STRATEGIC AUTONOMY  April 2021  25  smart working gain in popularity. As a result, strategies for protection, mitigation and  response must be adapted to these trends.   Trusted information sharing. Beyond technology, there is a need to establish and  foster trusted forums for cyber threat information exchange, whereby data on incidents  can be shared to a limited community in a detailed manner. The ISACs already  mentioned are key actors in developing these community forums and improving  Europe’s cybersecurity readiness.  3.3.5. Long-term objectives  Europe should try to remain autonomous in the long term, as far as cyber threat management  and response are concerned. Autonomy refers to capabilities and capacity related to SOCs,  including skills and training programmes, SIEM platforms, managed security services and cyber  threat intelligence information acquisition. This is a prerequisite condition, to ensure that  digitalisation of society conforms to our needs and values and does not induce unacceptable  cyber threats. The priorities should be balanced between prevention, for instance hardening  current systems and building trustworthy software and hardware components (Sections 3.2 and  3.4, respectively), and efficient responses to incidents, which requires people who are well  trained and who are able to react in the event of an attack (cyber response and capacity  building). This balance is fundamental to preserving the practical use of IT and cyberphysical  systems. Success will enable Europe to retain sufficient autonomy to fight against major  cyberattacks and actors that pose a threat.  3.4.  TRUSTWORTHY HARDWARE PLATFORMS  3.4.1. Current and future context of trustworthy hardware platforms  Suppliers, many of them located outside Europe, are increasingly introducing new features such  as secure boot, image signing and unique device identity in their hardware platforms. Although  they were introduced to increase the security of devices, these features might undermine  usability, making it difficult for the end user to understand the added value in terms of benefits  and drawbacks. Moreover, as demonstrated by the abovementioned scenario, such features  may not be trustworthy, since additional testing may be needed to validate the absence of bugs  and exploits.  At the same time, complex attacks involving hardware implementation or hardware/software  interactions (such as Spectre (54), Meltdown (55) and Rowhammer (56)) are becoming a threat to  extremely popular hardware platforms. Although fixes are available for a few of them, an  extensive fix without significant performance loss remains out of reach at the time of writing this  report.

Daniel has just acquired a brand-new smartphone with an advanced security feature enabling him to  store his private data and prevent applications from accessing it. Unfortunately, this functionality has a  significant flaw. If the smartphone is dropped in water, it triggers a hardware bug that attackers can  exploit to gain access to his personal data.  CYBERSECURITY RESEARCH DIRECTIONS FOR  THE EU’S DIGITAL STRATEGIC AUTONOMY  April 2021  26  Any system may feature hardware or software side bugs or vulnerabilities. To minimise security incidents, software  should be kept up to date, and trustworthy hardware platforms should be used. In addition, an appropriate  configuration is needed to increase security.  * Network intrusion detection system (NIDS)  *  CYBERSECURITY RESEARCH DIRECTIONS FOR  THE EU’S DIGITAL STRATEGIC AUTONOMY  April 2021  27  3.4.2. Problem definition and criticality  Sourcing hardware components manufactured in Europe is a rarity nowadays, as manufacturers  have moved their production to Asia. European countries have failed to provide incentives to  suppliers of chipsets to persuade them not to relocate production to Asia, even though there is a  risk of intellectual property (IP) rights violation (57) and tampering (58) (59). Vendors and suppliers  outsource various aspects of design, fabrication, testing and packaging of integrated circuits  (ICs). This widens the threat scenarios, which now include malicious insertion of Trojan circuits,  designed to act as silicon time bombs, IC piracy, untrustworthy third-party IPs and malicious  system disruption and diversion (60). As a result, there is an increasing risk that hardware  components including backdoors or undesired functionality might be exploited by an attacker,  while the verification of the vulnerabilities in hardware is expensive and time-consuming, and  unfeasible for the majority of chips.  Moreover, the EU supply chain for the ICT industry might be disrupted or lose its competitive  edge if component suppliers from other continents decide to follow aggressive selling methods,  such as using different price strategies for the European market or, even worse, restricting the  possibility of buying certain components.  In the near future, operating fleets of drones or vehicles with remote secure management will be  challenging without a local ‘trust anchor’. A trust anchor is a hardware anchor that bridges  communication between an operating system and hardware, integrating a highly secure system  on a chip for holistic system defence. The anchor helps an operating system kernel to actively  monitor its extensions and can also track bus traffic within the system-on-a-chip platform to  prevent untrusted third-party IP modules from performing malicious operations (61) and thus  causing security challenges. As an example, the SecureIoT project (62) aims to provide security  services in the areas of Industry 4.0, socially assistive robots and connected autonomous cars.  Sharing hardware platforms in virtualised environments, as envisaged for the future 5G  networks (see Section 3.7), enables attackers to leverage hardware vulnerabilities. Maintaining  hardware expertise is crucial to ensuring that Europe develops its own IoT infrastructure,  sourced from locally designed components.  Consequently, it is of paramount importance that Europe sources its own trustworthy hardware,  not only to secure its supply chain and competitive edge but also to possess the capacity to  control secure infrastructure of the future, from autonomous drones and vehicles to 5G networks  and power grids.

Efforts towards establishing trustworthy hardware platforms  Europe is a global leader in security relating to embedded systems, from smart card security to  other embedded platforms. There is also a strong level of expertise in micro-architecture attacks  among European research teams. For example, the FutureTPM project (63) aims to design and  develop a quantum-resistant trusted platform module (TPM). However, investment in hardware,  and particularly secure hardware, seems to have been limited since the development (and  widespread commercialisation) of smart cards and SIM cards. It is relevant to come back to  hardware and examine if, given these new threats, Europe can maintain its edge with regard to  the development of secure hardware components. Acquisitions and merging of European  companies by non-European players might affect our autonomy in procuring critical  components. In fact, in 2017, 30 % of the acquired European small and medium-sized  enterprises (SMEs) – market leaders in specialised high-tech areas – were acquired by non-EU  companies (64). In such cases, (i) the EU loses know-how, (ii) the IP moves outside Europe and  (iii) the European industry becomes dependent on imported components.  3.4.4. Recommendations  There are many ways in which hardware tools could support and improve cybersecurity as a  whole. Specific action items include the following.   Bootstrap security. Research and design new methods to ensure the continuous  integrity of hardware/software platforms, ensuring smooth operation and secure  transition from hardware to firmware to software, during the whole lifecycle of a product  (design, manufacturing, maintenance).   Hardware-induced vulnerabilities. Design and develop methods for detecting and  remediating hardware-induced vulnerabilities, as well as hardware trojans, to ensure  strong platform integrity. Black/white box testing technologies for hardware should be  studied extensively.   Side channel attacks. Detect and protect platforms that may leak information because  of radiation or power consumption, and certify those that are less prone to leakage.  This topic has been studied in either very small (smart card) or very specific (military)  contexts and lacks wider applicability.   Hardware-anchored cybersecurity tools. Hardware remains one of the best trust  anchors available, but it has significant costs. Efficient (cost, energy) hardware support  for cybersecurity is a difficult challenge, but one that also holds significant promises for  more secure platforms. This may form the basis required for strong authentication  (which has remained elusive so far) and global identity management (including not only  people but also businesses, objects and services). Research into new approaches  beyond public key infrastructure should also allow massive deployment of secure  hardware with reduced complexity.   Open hardware architecture. The example of the RISC-V foundation (65)  demonstrates that it is possible to develop and share hardware architecture openly.  This model should support Europe in developing alternative hardware supply chains in  the event of difficulties with the current supply.

Post-treatments, typically AI, require that sensors provide reliable  information further up the chain. However, attacks are targeting sensors more and  more, for example computer vision (66). Europe should explore the development of  reliable and secure sensing technologies.  3.4.5. Long-term objective  The long-term objective of trustworthy hardware platforms is to ensure that the EU possesses  the capability and capacity to guarantee access and control over high-quality hardware  components, in order to meet its industrial development needs as such components become  key in almost all products and services that are being developed and commercialised.  Moreover, the Cybersecurity Act (67) enables ENISA to establish a European cybersecurity  certification framework for ICT products, services and processes that provides different levels of  assurance.  3.5.  CRYPTOGRAPHY  3.5.1. Current and future context of cryptography  Cryptography is one of the leading areas of research in Europe and one of the most advanced  theoretical areas of cybersecurity, relying on models and formal proofs for verification and  validation.  In the cryptographic community, competitions are being organised to develop new algorithms.  Since 2017, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has been running a  competition for quantum-safe cryptographic algorithms, with the process expected to be  completed in accordance with NIST standards during the period 2022–2024 (68). The selected  algorithms will guarantee that the confidentiality and integrity of the data are protected from  attacks by conventional and quantum computers. It is critical during the standardisation process  that all weaknesses are properly analysed and reviewed through peer review in a transparent  manner, which has not always been the case (69).  Mastering cryptography is a key element for nation states, and acquisition of technology from  third parties is a significant weakness, as shown by the story of the Crypto AG company (70).  Given the importance of strong cryptographic algorithms and protocols to national security,  many EU Member States have created national crypto strategies to ensure long-term access to  state-of-the-art crypto tools. Unfortunately, this has limited the possibility of publishing lists of  recommended cryptographic algorithms and protocols that are valid in all Member States, and  has thus created fragmentations in the single market.

(70) https://www.cryptomuseum.com/manuf/crypto/index.htm  One of the most singular characteristics of the art of deciphering is the strong conviction possessed by  every person, even moderately acquainted with it, that he is able to construct a cipher which nobody else  can decipher.

Problem definition and criticality  Cryptographic algorithms are one of the fundamental pillars of cybersecurity, providing basic  properties such as integrity, confidentiality and authentication of origin. Although cryptography is  increasingly being used in classic IT, its use in industrial controls, which are often used in critical  infrastructure, has been limited. Issues are related to the difficulty of upgrading legacy  equipment, whose lifespan is counted in decades, and using cryptographic tools in power-  constrained devices. For example, encrypting or signing data requires additional computing  power, which is sometimes not available in resource- or power-limited devices. In addition, all  cryptographic material needs to be maintained, for example by regularly renewing keys, and the  overheads of management procedures are often difficult to manage. These challenges remain  difficult to solve at the extreme ends of the usage spectrum, for example for hardware-  constrained tiny devices relying on the environment to obtain energy and for high-speed  environments requiring encryption at the speed of memory or cache.  Despite their advantages and formal validation, cryptographic algorithms and protocols  sometimes fail. In this respect, the example of the key reinstallation attacks (KRACKs)  vulnerability (71) shows that even seemingly insignificant deviations from the proven process  lead to serious vulnerabilities; this core protocol issue had significant additional effects on the  features of newer protocols as they leveraged the older functionality (72).  Recent announcements of quantum computers and testbeds by companies such as Intel,  Google, IBM and ATOS indicate that it will become necessary to prepare quantum-resistant  cryptographic algorithms and protocols. Europe is contributing to the trend in the quantum  flagship (73). Since legacy cryptographic algorithms, protocols and suites require a significant  amount of time to become deprecated, and their replacements also require a significant amount  of time to be deployed, maintaining Europe’s capabilities in cryptography necessitates forward-  thinking and planning.  Beyond cryptographic algorithms and protocols, the EU should also invest in supporting  infrastructure, such as public key certificate authorities. Today, the top free and commercial  certificate authorities (Let’s Encrypt (74), Comodo, Symantec, Digicert, GeoTrust (75)) represent a  cumulative 97 % of the market share and are located outside the EU. Controlling the keys and  the infrastructure is required to ensure the confidentiality and availability of our communications.

Not having control of the encryption or signature keys puts a  system’s security at risk and affects the trust it has established with other systems.  CYBERSECURITY RESEARCH DIRECTIONS FOR  THE EU’S DIGITAL STRATEGIC AUTONOMY  April 2021  32  3.5.3. Efforts towards establishing strong cryptography  A number of European projects, such as the Networks of Excellence, have worked towards  fortifying Europe in the area of cryptography. The EU-funded Ecrypt I and Ecrypt II Networks of  Excellence (76) organised a competition to create a new stream cipher; the Fentec project (77) is  developing new solutions for functional encryption, providing new cryptographic building blocks  for privacy-sensitive applications.  Cryptographic functions and protocols have become mainstream for information systems.  Today, most web traffic is secured by the Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS),  although the underlying protocol has changed over the past 25 years from Secure Sockets  Layer (SSL) to Transport Layer Security version 1.3 (TLSv1.3). Issues related to other  fundamental protocols such as the Domain Name System (DNS) and the Border Gateway  Protocol (BGP) need to be addressed, but the process of introducing secure alternatives to  existing fundamental infrastructure is very slow (78). For example, despite the fact that the  current version of the DNS security extensions protocol was standardised between 2005 and  2013, the validation rate of domain names worldwide was less than 30 % (79) in April 2020.  Although significant progress has been made with regard to algorithms and protocols, the  overall infrastructure required to operate them remains insufficient. For example, public key  infrastructure and certificate distribution remain mostly in the private sector, and the level of trust  that can be associated with certificates remains difficult to evaluate, as shown by the example of  the DigiNotar failure (80).  3.5.4. Recommendations  As computing power, memory and mathematical tools progress, it is clear that cryptographic  algorithms and protocols are aging and thus becoming weaker. Research and standardisation in  cryptography should, therefore, continue to ensure that the available tools are efficient when  faced with emerging computing paradigms. Specific action items include the following.   Post-quantum cryptography. Although they are probably still far away from  commercial (or even practical) use, quantum computers are starting to appear in  specific settings. This new paradigm implies a complete rethinking of cryptographic  structures, and this can be considered an opportunity for a global refresh of our  cryptographic tools, enabling their use in environments in which they cannot currently  be deployed.   Basic cryptographic building blocks. Cryptographic tools need to be adapted to the  new environments, applications and domains in which we want to use them. For  example, fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) remains extremely expensive and  beyond reach, despite its promise to secure cloud environments. Research is  necessary to either develop alternative and more efficient homomorphic encryption  schemes, such as somewhat homomorphic encryption, or adapt algorithms to new  applications.   Standards-based maintenance of cryptographic suites. Standards frequently  specify cryptographic suites, enabling authentication and confidentiality in a  homogeneous and coherent way. As time passes, certain cryptographic suites weaken  and must be updated, to remove compromised algorithms or to increase key lengths.

The EU must  invest in the  ability to  establish,  control and  verify standards  for processes  and products  and develop its  own crypto  policy and  infrastructure for  the public good.  https://www.ecrypt.eu.org/ http://fentec.eu/ https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/7-steps-to-shore-up-bgp https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/7-steps-to-shore-up-bgp https://stats.labs.apnic.net/dnssec  CYBERSECURITY RESEARCH DIRECTIONS FOR  THE EU’S DIGITAL STRATEGIC AUTONOMY  April 2021  33  This maintenance process should be performed well in advance of any risk of  compromise, to ensure that users have sufficient time to upgrade their cryptosystems.  Europe should lead crypto- standardisation  activities by proposing scientifically sound  algorithms and fostering consensus among European solutions.   Cryptographic protocols. As new services and uses emerge, new protocols such as  multiparty computation (MPC) and zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) are required to  ensure that these new services are sufficiently secure by design and that they maintain  user trust by avoiding a single point of failure and reducing the risk of leaks. This  entails also developing new dedicated symmetric building blocks to increase efficiency.   Tools to support security validation of cryptographic implementations. Tools are  needed to ensure that the progress made through stronger cryptography actually  translates into secure implementations.   Strong EU certification authority. The EU and its Member States should reflect on  the implementation of an EU-based public key infrastructure.  3.5.5. Long-term objectives  To ensure that the EU retains access to state-of-the-art cryptographic protection, we must invest  in the ability to establish, control and verify standards for processes and products that are vital  to Europe. This may include establishing European-based cryptographic suites to ensure  control over IP and limit the risk of hidden issues, such as cryptographic backdoors.  In the long term, as cryptographic algorithms and protocols and the supporting certificates are  so fundamental to cybersecurity, Europe should develop its own crypto policy and infrastructure  for public good.  3.6.  USER-CENTRIC SECURITY PRACTICES AND TOOLS  3.6.1. Current and future context of user-centric security practices and tools  It is a well-known issue that users are, in many cases, the weak point of organisations. Phishing  attacks continuously result in (i) organisations being infected with malware and (ii) private user  accounts being hijacked (81).  Security seems to be a very complicated and annoying topic for the standard IT user. The  problem of security has existed for a long time, as exemplified by studies led in the late 1990s  on email encryption (82) that received the test-of-time award 20 years after. We need to  acknowledge that, at present, a significant number of users, if not most of them, do not use a  secure email system that provides guarantees about the senders of messages and the integrity  of the content. Further to this discrepancy, which leads to spam and phishing, email use is  widespread for both personal and professional use.  (81) Caputo, D. D., Pfleeger, S. L., Freeman, J. D. and Johnson, M. E., ‘Going spear phishing: Exploring embedded  training and awareness’, IEEE Security & Privacy, Vol. 12, No 1, 2013, pp. 28–38.  (82) Whitten, A. and Tygar, J. D., ‘Why Johnny can’t encrypt: A usability evaluation of PGP 5.0’, in USENIX Security  Symposium, Vol. 348, 1999, pp. 169–184.  Never give an order that cannot be obeyed.  ― General Douglas MacArthur  It takes 20 years to build a reputation and few minutes of cyber-incident to ruin it.  ― Stéphane Nappo, Chief Information Security Officer, BNP  CYBERSECURITY RESEARCH DIRECTIONS FOR  THE EU’S DIGITAL STRATEGIC AUTONOMY  April 2021  34  It appears that productivity and personal interest are considered a higher priority than  cybersecurity and that users may reach their goals in creative ways, circumventing any security  system.  3.6.2. Problem definition and criticality  Many studies show that phishing and ransomware attacks have a significant economic  impact (83). In recent years, the WannaCry ransomware has shut down factories in France and  hospitals in the United Kingdom (84), resulting in serious economic losses and potentially having  a negative impact on human lives.  Cybersecurity tools are perceived as a burden to end users. Users tend to believe that such  tools reduce productivity, without bringing useful benefits. A recent study shows that even  cybersecurity experts cannot agree on what simple advice can be given to users to improve  their safety online (85).  We are at a point where people trust IT systems because they work, most of the time, and  because their dysfunctions are a notable nuisance without being an unbearable burden. Trust,  however, is difficult to obtain and easy to degrade. Cyber physical systems must improve their  usability so that users do not see themselves as being constrained by the systems and continue  using them for Europe to obtain the benefits of the digital society.  3.6.3. Efforts towards establishing user-centric security practices and tools  Several projects have already started in this area. For example, the Encase project (86) aims to  design and implement browser-based architecture for the protection of minors from malicious  actors in online social networks. The Privacy & Us project (87) aims to train early-stage  researchers to be able to analyse, design and develop innovative solutions to questions related  to the protection of citizens’ privacy, considering the multidisciplinary and intersectoral aspects  of the issue. The Dogana project (88) aims to reduce the risk created by modern Social  Engineering 2.0 attack techniques. Such projects may have outcomes that will benefit standard  users’ everyday interactions with IT systems by reducing the risk of attacks.  An enormous number of cybersecurity systems have been developed over the years, and many  of them have failed when it comes to deployment. There are many well-known examples, such  as the 20 years it took to develop usable standards to secure the internet-routing protocol BGP,  which are still not widely used. There are many such standards awaiting deployment, and many  security systems, which do more to burden the users than to solve their problems. The example  of completely automated public Turing test to tell computers and humans apart (CAPTCHA) is  particularly interesting, as we have known for a long time that tests of this kind are more easily  broken by algorithms than solved by users (89), which has led to them being used more in the  creation of ground truth for image processing systems than as access control mechanisms.

Consequently, it is important that systems let users maintain their  privacy and request consent before sharing private information.  CYBERSECURITY RESEARCH DIRECTIONS FOR  THE EU’S DIGITAL STRATEGIC AUTONOMY  April 2021  36  3.6.4. Recommendations  Many actions need to be taken to change the playing field and transform cybersecurity from a  burden to an asset that helps systems function better, deliver better digital services and provide  a clear benefit to end users. Europe should ensure that services that are useful for European  citizens either are available in Europe according to European values or favour the emergence of  alternatives that respect these values. Specific action items include research to develop the  following.   Privacy-enhancing technologies (PET). Develop practices and tools that support  users in preserving online privacy. Research should ensure that users can easily  enforce regulations such as the GDPR.   Usable security. Develop cybersecurity methods and tools that actually meet users’  needs and that support their activities instead of acting as barriers to productivity.   Human-centred security and privacy. Ensure that the end user is indeed the subject  who needs to be protected.   Security visibility. Design user interfaces and interactions that are actually perceived  by the end users and that help them adopt actual behaviours.   Social engineering and human errors in cybersecurity. Build examples and  methods that can effectively provide new insights into the manner in which humans  interact with each other on social media and other online mechanisms, to avoid  common mistakes that lead to system compromise.   Verifiable computing. Using tools described in the previous sections, Europe could  support the development of methods and tools for verifiable computing, ensuring that  end users have the means to verify independently the proper behaviour of ICT  systems, further developing and enhancing trust.  3.6.5. Long-term objectives  Developing user-centric security practices and tools will help weave cybersecurity into our digital  lives in the longer term. This should enable EU citizens to develop trust in digital technologies  for both personal and professional activities. Such practices and tools should become invisible  when everything goes well, and should be visible and explicit when there is a need for  protection. The success of cybersecurity implies long-term sustainable growth of the European  digital society.  Actions should  be taken to  transform  cybersecurity  from a burden to  an asset and a  benefit for end  users.  CYBERSECURITY RESEARCH DIRECTIONS FOR  THE EU’S DIGITAL STRATEGIC AUTONOMY  April 2021  37  3.7.  DIGITAL COMMUNICATION SECURITY  3.7.1. Current and future context of digital communication security  The overall networking environment is moving from ownership-based infrastructure towards on-  demand, pay-per-use networking and computing. Software-defined networking (90) and large-  scale virtualisation (91) are already deployed in data centres and IT services, rapidly penetrating  cyber physical systems and pushing towards large-scale deployment of sensors and actuators  in the IoT. This flexibility, however, blurs the notion of ownership and localisation of  communication systems and platforms as they move across infrastructure at will.  Moving towards virtual communication environments (such as cloud computing infrastructure,  software-defined networks and slicing) is a trend that companies and governments alike are  rapidly adopting. We are currently relying on platforms widely operated outside Europe for  services that are in many respects critical. The fundamental promise of the cloud relies on the  fact that infrastructure is scalable and that communication is available.  The global picture leads us to an environment in which data centres may be hosted outside  Europe and the supporting digital communication infrastructure relies on non-European sourced  technologies.  3.7.2. Problem definition and criticality  Owing to the digitisation of services, all major sectors have an increasing level of dependency  on digital infrastructure. For example, many services are now offered by cloud providers, and  any unavailability, loss of integrity or violation of confidentiality may have serious consequences  for businesses or governments that use their services. The use of multitenant cloud storage also  poses security risks. Moreover, the unavailability of financial operations – because of, for  instance, a denial of service attack – has the potential to affect the operations and economy of  most countries and businesses. Although the new connectivity provides numerous opportunities  to improve the services offered to customers, it also enlarges the attack surface by exposing the  connected industries (Industry 4.0) and critical services (e.g. connected vehicles, smart cities).  Moreover, 5G architecture based on network function virtualisation, network slicing and  software-defined networking will expand the threat landscape by combining traditional IP-based  threats with all-5G network (core, access and edge) threats, insecure legacy 2G/3G/4G  generations and threats introduced by virtualisation technology (92).  This trend in generic on-demand virtual infrastructure is, at present, one of the possible  advantages and drawbacks of cybersecurity. Knowing where a system or service resides is one  of the elements that enables the definition of a perimeter, thus allowing filtering and access  control. Realising which resources are available permits risk evaluation and the selection of  mitigation methods.  Another trend that has an impact on communication is the need for connectivity, which is  exhibited by almost every object that we acquire today. From home assistants to connected  vehicles, from medical devices to smart meters, many industries and services are heavily  (90) Kreutz, D., Ramos, F., Verissimo, P., Rothenberg, C.

A lack of connectivity, for example because of a cyberattack, will  significantly impair the proper function of essential services.  The current state of the art is that Europe is heavily dependent on outside suppliers for both  technology (e.g. communication hardware) and services (e.g. cloud services), whereas other  regions that have heavily invested in the development of virtual communication infrastructure  are also influencing standards (93). This dependency leaves Europe open to difficulties in  sourcing and deploying these new technologies and services to support its continuous  development.  3.7.3. Efforts towards ensuring digital communication security  Europe is already embracing technological advancements in communications, an example  being the 5G infrastructure public–private partnership (PPP) (94). However, in recent years there  has been a marked absence of cybersecurity projects within the 5G umbrella. As a result,  although services have been deployed and demonstrated over 5G technologies, the security  and safety of 5G infrastructure remains an open question. Although 5G infrastructure  technologies are developing rapidly, network operating systems remain behind in terms of  security.  Europe has developed activities under the umbrella of the 5G PPP to address this issue; an  example of this is the 5G-Ensure project (95), which developed security architecture and a  roadmap for security enablers in 5G. Another example is ENISA’s efforts to develop a detailed  threat assessment of 5G infrastructure components (96).  In the context of quantum communications, Europe launched the Open European Quantum Key  Distribution Testbed (OpenQKD) (97) pilot programme. The purpose of the programme is to  create and test experimental quantum communication infrastructure, using quantum key  distribution (98), featuring high-level and quantum-safe security. This programme is expected to  advance the technology involved in quantum communications and reinforce the EU’s strategic  digital capacities.

For this reason, it is important to use  secure channels and trusted communication providers.  CYBERSECURITY RESEARCH DIRECTIONS FOR  THE EU’S DIGITAL STRATEGIC AUTONOMY  April 2021  40  3.7.4. Recommendations  Communication infrastructure is necessary for every service we use. Given this, Europe should  consider the fact that maintaining trust and efficiency in communication services is essential for  the development of a digital Europe. Specific action items include research to develop the  following.   Network services as critical infrastructure. It should be taken into consideration that  cyberattacks on network services have a systemic and potentially very significant effect  on all services, including the operation of all critical ICT infrastructure. Therefore,  network services should be considered a major building block of all critical  infrastructure and secured similarly. Secure network management and operating  systems of network appliances, either virtual or physical, are major building blocks  required to secure the networking infrastructure.   Network security. Develop new methods to detect cyberattacks and mitigate their  effects, and then include them in the design of new service protocols. Such research  will ensure that network security is achieved from the beginning and not retrofitted as  an afterthought. It should also tackle the ability to manage threats over wide-area  networks to mitigate their effects and provide by-design practices and tools to ensure  that carrying out attacks has too high a cost for attackers compared with the gains they  expect.   IoT security. New cybersecurity methods and tools must take into account IoT  constraints, such as energy, storage and bandwidth limitations, to provide  authenticated and resilient communication channels. In relation to this concept, ENISA  has published a report on IoT security (99), listing threats and good practices and  providing recommendations.   Virtual networks. Develop specific cybersecurity methods and tools that can  demonstrably secure virtual environments in which boundaries and borders have  disappeared to such an extent that they cannot be used to define security policies and  assess risk, and that end users may have less knowledge about the system they uses  than the service providers and attackers.  3.7.5. Long-term objective  The long-term objective of digital communication security is to be able to deploy and operate  seamless infrastructure that ensures end-to-end secure communication regardless of whether it  relies on virtual means or physical means. Developing a secure-by-design network operating  system could support Europe’s autonomy in managing its digital communication infrastructure  and could provide a path towards better control and autonomy over this infrastructure.  Security by design for communication infrastructure beyond 5G is also a significant concern.  Even if we do not know what the future of communication infrastructure will be, we need to take  into account cybersecurity aspects as early as possible in the design process for these new  network paradigms. Therefore, Europe should promote investment in creating resilient secure-  by-design solutions for seamless innovative communication infrastructure.

SOCIAL SCIENCE  DIMENSIONS OF STRATEGIC  AUTONOMY  Although digital autonomy and sovereignty rely on technological leadership, and most notably  on significant research and development, technical leadership alone is insufficient to ensure  sustainable strategic autonomy in the long term. The EU must also count on a skilled workforce  and a strong and actionable legal and regulatory framework for research and development.  4.1.  HUMAN CAPACITY BUILDING  Europe must ensure (i) that its businesses and governments have access to a sufficient number  of skilled people who can design, deploy, operate and audit critical infrastructure services, and  (ii) that it retains these skilled people in the context of a global shortage of cybersecurity  professionals.  This next president is going to inherit the most sophisticated and persistent cyber espionage culture  the world has ever seen. He needs to surround himself with experts that can expedite the allocation of  potent layers of next generation defence around our targeted critical infrastructure silos.  ― James Scott, Senior Fellow, Institute for Critical Infrastructure Technology  CYBERSECURITY RESEARCH DIRECTIONS FOR  THE EU’S DIGITAL STRATEGIC AUTONOMY  April 2021  42  4.1.1. Students and cybersecurity  Although the shortage of trained professionals is widely recognised, it should also be made  clear that one (if not the major) reason for this shortage is that there is not a sufficient number of  students entering dedicated educational programmes. Some efforts have been made to  increase the visibility of cybersecurity curricula, including the publication of training needs  related to the deployment of the NIS Directive (100). Other initiatives include the EHR4Cyber (101)  and the Women4Cyber (102) initiatives. However, the level of interest in cybersecurity remains  significantly below the level of interest in other IT fields, such as AI and game development.  Higher salaries elsewhere may well result in professionals or companies moving away from  Europe and this skills shortage consequently increasing.  Europe should thus look at additional ways to enrol students in cybersecurity curricula. Several  alternative approaches could be adopted, including the Industrial Cyber Security Center of  Excellence (103). This encourages IT professionals in companies (car manufacturers, critical  infrastructure operators, etc.) to follow a 1-year training programme on cybersecurity. Upon  return to their companies, the combination of their domain knowledge and cybersecurity skills  enables them to act as ambassadors for cybersecurity in their professional environment.  Another potential action could be to make the job market more visible and understandable to  prospective students.  4.1.2. Skills development  The job market relies heavily on professional certifications. For cybersecurity, most – if not all –  of the widely recognised certifications are based in the United States. Take, for example, the  Global Information Assurance Certification (GIAC) and the Certified Information Systems  Security Professional certification (CISSP), which are widely accepted by many companies and  considered useful by professionals. Unfortunately, although Europe has a wealth of professional  educational companies, these companies rely on frameworks that originate in the United States  to assess skills and deliver certifications. Europe should develop its own cybersecurity skills  framework, with the aim of creating a common skills language for individuals, employers and  training providers. This will help to facilitate skills recognition and support employment and  employability. The framework should allow for further specification and specialisation by  Member States, to accommodate specific needs and requirements, without endangering its  pan-European approach, as that would be counterproductive for the single digital market. The  framework should be complementary to the United Kingdom’s Cyber Security Body of  Knowledge (104), an important step in formalising cybersecurity concepts.  Alternative approaches may also prove useful for specific domains or for acquiring specific skills  without obtaining a formal degree, such as the Rogers Cybersecure Catalyst training  programme (105). Europe should facilitate the establishment of courses that provide a response  to the need for cybersecurity-specialised practitioners and that offer high-level opportunities to  people who are looking for a different career path.

To support trainers, Europe could probably fund a few high-level Erasmus Mundus school  networks or similar programmes targeted at this specific area.  4.1.3. Ethics and cybersecurity  Beyond technology, cybersecurity curricula should include social and legal dimensions,  supporting the view that ethics has a strong link to cybersecurity. As an example, through its  teaching material, the CANVAS project (106) will ensure that the future generation of  cybersecurity experts obtains basic insights into and knowledge of how to tackle ethical and  legal dilemmas in cybersecurity.  4.2.  LEGAL AND REGULATORY FRAMEWORKS  The GDPR and the Cybersecurity Act provide a strong legal basis for the development of  European autonomy. It remains to be seen how these regulations and frameworks will come to  be deployed and to be followed by global businesses.  4.2.1. Tools for evaluating GDPR compliance  Beyond the current legal framework, the EU should reflect on and make freely available to users  tools that enable them to assess independently and transparently the use of their personal  information. The social success of the GDPR among the general public means that the  capability to choose between providing information or giving up on a service should become an  informed decision, and one that can be exerted at any point, independently of any service,  anywhere in the world.  4.2.2. Evaluation of cybersecurity certification schemes  The current European Cybersecurity Act provides a framework for the development of  certification schemes for IT products and services. It is impossible to tell at this stage what  impact this regulation will have and if industry will embrace the development of new certification  schemes that are actually useful to users and that adhere to European values.  In this respect, the new mandate of ENISA on cybersecurity certification (107) is a critical step  that should sustain European digital strategic autonomy, simplifying certification activities for the  industry (thus encouraging certified products in the marketplace) while ensuring that all Member  States can rely on EU-wide capabilities.

A.1.  METHODOLOGY OF THE STUDY  The methodology followed to develop the document is as follows.   We analysed recent relevant cybersecurity research roadmaps (such as the NIS  Working Group 3 strategic research agenda (108); the European cybersecurity strategic  research and innovation agenda for a contractual PPP (109); AEGIS – White Paper on  Research and Innovation in Cybersecurity (110); and SecUnity – Cybersecurity  Research: Challenges and course of action (111)) and other national initiatives.   Through this analysis, 17 research challenges stood out (listed in Section A.2). We  considered that this list of challenges represented the collective opinion of  stakeholders of the EU ecosystem with respect to cybersecurity research.   To find out which of these 17 research challenges were the most important, we created  a survey, which was hosted on a designated web page  (https://ec.europa.eu/eusurvey). The survey was widely disseminated among the  cybersecurity community, with the aim of prioritising the research challenges involved  in the support of EU digital sovereignty and thus autonomy. To ensure that we had a  prioritised list at the end of the survey, the survey respondents were asked to rank the  five most important challenges.   The results of the survey (see Section A.3) led to the selection of the seven most  highly ranked research challenges.   A first document was then drafted that elaborated on the seven challenges.   To receive feedback, the document was circulated and reviewed by experts in the field.   An open validation workshop was organised in Brussels on 30th January 2020, which  led to the final round of comments and finalisation of the document.  A.2. SURVEY OBJECTIVE  The objective of the survey was to obtain from members of the community their opinions on the  importance of each research challenge with respect to the EU’s strategic autonomy. Although  all research challenges may be potentially important, some may be less critical to autonomy  than others.

This clearly reflects the importance of data and  the sensitivity of data-driven services.  The next five items were also highly ranked, despite achieving relatively lower scores.  The final item that we retained – digital communication security – attracted less attention than  the others in terms of its ranking position. Despite this, it achieved a significant score (one that  was very close to the score of the challenge that ranked sixth), as many respondents included it  in their list of priorities.  The eighth priority, ‘Authentication, authorisation and identity management’, achieved a score of  0.18 only, so it was considered that this priority was of less interest to the community and less  important to the EU’s digital strategic autonomy.  All 17 priorities were voted for by at least 50 respondents, indicating that all of them were  relevant to the topic.  A.4. RESPONDENT ANALYSIS  Overall, ninety-four respondents completed the survey.

It has been helping the  European market to stay competitive, improve the quality and quantity of jobs, and continue to  support the European way of life. The impact of our research and innovation depends on the  capacity of our economies to become more knowledge-oriented and innovation-driven and  invest enough resources in addressing the most important challenges and exploiting the right  framework conditions to stimulate innovation.  The European Union Agency for Cybersecurity has identified key research and innovation  topics in cybersecurity to address specific strategic objectives: in 2018 the goal was to make the  EU more cybersecure (1). In this document – the second in the series – the objective is to  support the EU’s digital strategic autonomy.  The term ‘digital strategic autonomy’ can have different meanings in different contexts. In this  report, it is defined as the ability of Europe (2) to source products and services that meet its  needs and values, without undue influence from the outside world.  This mission-driven roadmap presents seven prioritised challenges to support research,  development and innovation in relation to the EU’s digital strategic autonomy. These priorities  were derived from a set of 17 topics, which in turn were extracted and synthesised from recent  research roadmaps. To finalise these priorities, an open survey took place, which was  completed by 94 members of the European cybersecurity research and industrial community.  For each of these seven priorities, this document (i) explores the origins of the problem and its  importance, (ii) describes the state of the art and the long-term objective of the topic and (iii)  recommends the necessary steps to reach this long-term objective.  The open consultation revealed that the highest priority is related to data security, with an  emphasis on privacy, data protection, trust in algorithms and artificial intelligence. The most  important research and innovation challenges also include software and hardware security,  digital communications security, cryptography, and detection of and response to  cyberattacks. Finally, user-centric aspects related to the overall acceptance of digital  services, including understanding the consequences of decisions to enforce or bypass security  mechanisms, is a knowledge area that should be included in future research.  Based on our findings, digital strategic autonomy will require an overarching vision of the  information and communications technology landscape, driven by ambitious policies that aim to  (i) protect European values and (ii) satisfy European needs for advanced and resilient services.

INTRODUCTION  The focus of this work is to identify the necessary research priorities to support the EU’s digital  strategic autonomy and thus digital sovereignty. In this introductory chapter, we (i) analyse how  the terms ‘digital strategic autonomy’ and ‘digital sovereignty’ have been used and propose the  definition used in this report, (ii) define the scope and target audience, and (iii) outline the  structure of the report.  1.1. DEFINITION OF DIGITAL STRATEGIC AUTONOMY AND SOVEREIGNTY  Over the past few years, people have been increasingly using the term ‘digital sovereignty’.  During the 2018 State of the Union speech, called ‘The hour of European sovereignty’,  President Juncker argued that the time had come for the EU to start working towards ‘becoming  more autonomous and living up to our global responsibilities’ (3). The term ‘digital sovereignty’  may have different meanings in different contexts, ranging from ‘nation state sovereignty’ to  ‘personal technological sovereignty (4). These contexts extend from individual citizens to social  movements and can include entire countries. These ambitions are reflected in the revised EU  strategy on cybersecurity, which aims to ‘build greater resilience and strategic autonomy’ and  (3) Juncker, J.-C., ‘The hour of European sovereignty’, State of the Union 2018  (https://ec.europa.eu/commission/sites/beta-political/files/soteu2018-speech_en.pdf).  (4) Couture, S. and Toupin, S., ‘What does the concept of “sovereignty” mean in digital, network and technological  sovereignty?’, paper presented at GigaNet: Global Internet Governance Academic Network, Annual Symposium  2017, 2018 (http://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.3107272).  https://ec.europa.eu/commission/sites/beta-political/files/soteu2018-speech_en.pdf http://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.3107272  CYBERSECURITY RESEARCH DIRECTIONS FOR  THE EU’S DIGITAL STRATEGIC AUTONOMY  April 2021  5  which states that it is in the EU’s strategic interest to ensure that ‘the EU retains and develops  the essential capacities to secure its digital economy, society and democracy’ (5).  According to a recent European Union Agency for Cybersecurity (ENISA) consultation report (6),  European digital sovereignty can be perceived as encompassing three categories:  1. data sovereignty over the personal data of EU citizens – the personal aspect,  2. digital sovereignty of the data-driven European industry – the industry aspect,  3. digital sovereignty of the EU and EU Member States – the political aspect.  A recent strategic note of the European Political Strategy Centre (EPSC) addresses strategic  autonomy in the digital age (7). The note develops concepts related to the capability of Europe  to maintain its strategic autonomy in an environment in which digital technologies are pervasive.  Strategic autonomy can be defined as ‘the ability, in terms of capacity and capabilities, to decide  and act upon essential aspects of one’s longer-term future in the economy, society and their  institutions’ (8). Strategic autonomy enables nations – and through them the EU – to retain their  independence and authority. The note defines three dimensions: industrial, operational and  political.   The industrial dimension requires that Europe is able to fulfil its digital needs. This  aspect supports the operational capability of Europe to leverage digital technologies, to  operate its critical infrastructure and to ensure that the infrastructure is resilient to  cyberattacks. Control of this critical digital infrastructure, in turn, enables political  strategic autonomy, namely the ability to make informed decisions freely and  independently.   The operational dimension relates to the resilience of the European communication  infrastructure and information and communications technology (ICT) systems. Owing  to cascading effects, a vulnerability affecting one service in one Member State can  have significant repercussions for others and eventually Europe as a whole.   The political dimension is associated with digital sovereignty, in a manner well  described by Viviane Reding (former Vice-President of the European Commission).  She defines digital sovereignty (9) as the ‘capacity to influence norms and standards of  information technology’, which is based on the more general definition of sovereignty  as the ‘capacity to determine one’s actions and norms’ (10).  We can thus define digital strategic autonomy as the ability of Europe to source products  and services that meet its needs and values, without undue influence from the outside  world. Needs may include hardware, software or algorithms, implemented as products and/or  services. Values imply a digital ecosystem that is fair and that respects privacy and digital rights.  Sourcing denotes that a product or service is either produced in the EU and verified to conform  to our needs and values, or acquired from outside and certified to comply with our needs and  values. This concept implies that Europe needs to produce some of these products  independently and provide such services.

SCOPE AND TARGET AUDIENCE  The present study provides an analysis of the key research and innovation knowledge areas to  support the EU’s digital strategic autonomy. Digital strategic autonomy is established by  ensuring a solid capacity to develop and maintain a strong ICT industry, which in turn will lead  to strategic autonomy for Europe and its citizens. The development of ICT companies, which  should be supported by a robust research and development ecosystem, can contribute to  creating a pipeline of innovations that are developed in Europe and that are primarily designed  to meet the needs and values of European citizens.  Therefore, the main objective of this report is to identify, analyse and describe the most  important knowledge areas necessary for developing products and services that meet the EU’s  needs and values and that guarantee a resilient ICT infrastructure. Investing in these areas of  cybersecurity research and development is of paramount importance for controlling and  operating resilient ICT infrastructure without interference. Resilience to technology attacks, such  as denial of service or malware, and resilience to data attacks, such as social platform incidents,  are key components that Europe should encourage by developing and guiding the appropriate  technologies.  This research roadmap could serve policymakers in providing objective-driven strategic  guidance for defining future projects and investments in cybersecurity. The prioritised  knowledge areas could be of use in defining industrial and research policies, with the ultimate  goal of ensuring EU digital autonomy and sovereignty. Moreover, researchers could use the  research and development areas presented in this report as a guide to addressing the research  and technological challenges and reviewing the state of the art and the long-term objectives of  each priority.  1.3.  STRUCTURE  This report is organised as follows.   Chapter 2 contains a number of practical examples illustrating fictional scenarios in  which the need for digital strategic autonomy in Europe is highlighted, and what could  happen if Europe fails to maintain its digital strategic autonomy.   Chapter 3 further analyses the research and innovation knowledge areas that were  considered by the cybersecurity community to be the most significant for ensuring  European digital strategic autonomy. A comic strip and an independent scenario are  included for each prioritised research topic to improve audience engagement and help  readers adopt lateral thinking.  The seven prioritised research areas are:  1. data security,  2. trustworthy software platforms,  3. cyber threat management and response,  4. trustworthy hardware platforms,  5. cryptography,  6. user-centric security practices and tools,  7. digital communication security.   Chapter 4 includes considerations of transversal aspects that cover all research areas  and that will reinforce the European impact on cybersecurity.  EU digital strategic  autonomy is the  ability of Europe to  source products  and services,  without undue  influence from the  outside world.

It concludes with an analysis of respondents by country and by  organisation type.  CYBERSECURITY RESEARCH DIRECTIONS FOR  THE EU’S DIGITAL STRATEGIC AUTONOMY  April 2021  8  2. STRATEGIC AUTONOMY IN  EUROPE: SCENARIOS  Digital technologies have pervaded our everyday lives, to the extent that it is extremely hard to  live in their absence. In the following paragraphs, fictional – yet plausible – scenarios that could  undermine the EU’s strategic autonomy are briefly described.  Interference with navigation services. ‘A cyberattack against a navigation server generated  fake traffic causing confusion to drivers and autonomous vehicles.’ In this context, autonomy  translates to the availability of maps and associated information and obtaining access to  positioning and routing algorithms and systems, without fearing that access to these data might  be blocked or that the data are fraudulent. However, external interference (e.g. Global  Positioning System signal jamming) may affect specific activities such as military exercises (11).  The areas of  Data security and  Trustworthy software platforms are analysed in  Sections 3.1 and 3.2, respectively.  Untrusted artificial intelligence (AI). ‘Hackers found a way to poison the results of an AI  cooking app to promote specific products.’ Although interference with cooking seems to be  limited with respect to autonomy, it is an example of when one’s freedom of choice might be  altered if the recipes or ingredients received are not of interest to the recipient. Moreover, one’s  choice to buy the ingredients from a provider might be influenced by an altered e-commerce list  presented. The area of  Data security is analysed in Section 3.1.  Disruption in the medical care system. ‘A hospital became out-of-service following a  ransomware attack that rendered its digital systems unusable.’ Cyber-securing our medical  infrastructures is of great importance, especially during pandemics (such as during the  coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic), so that they are available when we need  them the most. All medical devices are seamlessly connected, to support care staff and patients  with regard to various procedures of medical care, monitoring, administering medicine,  connecting beds and rooms, and using global platforms to exchange information. Medical files  have to be available to authorised personnel to enable them to provide efficient care. However,  the high level of dependence of the medical infrastructure on ICT, and its vulnerability to  malicious code, has already been seen in the impact of ransomware, such as the WannaCry  ransomware used to attack the National Health Service in the United Kingdom (12), the  ransomware attack on the Rouen University Hospital Centre in France (13), and more recently  the ransomware attack on a hospital in Germany, which was directly linked to a death (14). The  capability to verify the absence of vulnerabilities and malicious code in the infrastructure,  software or services we procure in combination with the ability to defend systems against  cyberattacks are also important elements of autonomy. The areas of  Trustworthy software  platforms and  Cyber threat management and response are analysed in Sections 3.2 and  3.3, respectively.

Products sourced from untrusted producers may feature software or hardware  vulnerabilities or even contain backdoors that could be triggered/exploited by malicious  attackers, and thus may compromise domestic safety and people’s privacy. The areas of  Trustworthy software platforms and  Trustworthy hardware platforms are analysed in  Sections 3.2 and 3.4, respectively.  Lack of supply chain availability. ‘Lack of supply of many digital components was observed  after a manufacturer, located outside the EU, temporary halted exports because of non-  compliance with EU regulations.’ Many products and services require electronic components  and platforms. Supply chain issues may result in a lack of availability of electronic components  required by the EU industry. Without such components (e.g. processors and chips), the supply  of both personal electronic devices and elements of the digital infrastructure cannot be  guaranteed, which potentially endangers Europe’s strategic autonomy in industries that rely on  the supply of devices, such as the automotive industry. The supply chain problem is linked to  the areas of  Trustworthy software platforms and  Trustworthy hardware platforms, which  are analysed in Sections 3.2 and 3.4, respectively.  Absence of control over communication infrastructure. ‘Hackers monitored users and their  data by exploiting vulnerabilities in the new generation of mobile communications.’ The  evolution of digital communication infrastructure has been guided by standards. Europe has  been a leader in mobile telecommunication standards (e.g. the Global System for Mobile  Communications (15)) and should continue to guide coordinated secure technological advances  through leadership of standardisation to ensure its autonomy over communication infrastructure.  However, this has become increasingly challenging as the telecommunication industry  transforms from an industry based exclusively on hardware to a software- and even cloud-  based industry. The areas of  Trustworthy software platforms and  Digital communication  security are analysed in Sections 3.2 and 3.7, respectively.  Need for post-quantum secure communications. ‘Encrypted network traffic recorded today  could be broken in 10 years through the use of post-quantum computers.’ To preserve today’s  secrets for longer, the EU will have to develop post-quantum cryptography. For this reason, the  EU should opt for the adoption of and transition to post-quantum secure communication  infrastructure when needed. The area of cryptography is analysed in Section 3.5.  Lack of control over a product or system lifecycle. ‘Numerous smartphone devices are  vulnerable as they do not receive the latest security updates.’ The current best practice for  suppressing vulnerabilities in software-based systems and products after production is patching.  This process is well accepted by end users. However, the patching processes for hardware  devices (e.g. firmware updates and updates to the lower layers of the infrastructure) remain  difficult and a research topic, for example in the context of the internet of things (IoT) (16). The  patching process itself is a strategic autonomy concern. On the one hand, patch availability is  critical for protection (17) and the absence of reliable and timely patches could have an impact  on strategic autonomy.

A complementary issue is assurance and certification. The areas of  Trustworthy  software platforms,  Trustworthy hardware platforms and user-centric practice and tools  are analysed in Sections 3.2, 3.4 and 3.6, respectively.  Critical infrastructure interruptions. ‘Hackers infiltrated the power grid system and took it out  of order.’ The protection of critical infrastructure against cyberattacks is of great importance, as  it is needed to preserve the EU’s autonomy. A disturbance in the operation of the healthcare  system during a pandemic, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, may put human lives in danger. In  the transport sector, our heavy reliance on guidance mechanisms could, for example,  significantly impair all transport systems, such as autonomous vehicles, trains or flights. As a  result, this may affect our safety, as accidental or malicious failures can occur. The same is true  for the energy sector. Failures in providing essential services threaten the EU economy and the  well-being of its citizens and may also cause loss of human lives. Deploying and operating self-  sufficient critical infrastructure and essential services is a key element of Europe’s digital  strategic autonomy. The areas of  Trustworthy software platforms and  Trustworthy hardware  platforms are analysed in Sections 3.2 and 3.4, respectively.  Loss of algorithmic control leading to loss of understanding of decision support  algorithms. ‘A false positive alert of an AI-powered cyberdefence system caused problems in  the internal network of the ministry.’ The United States and China are investing heavily in AI  technologies. Global companies based in the United States, such as Google, Amazon,  Facebook, Apple and Microsoft (GAFAM), and their Chinese counterparts (Baidu, Alibaba,  Tencent and Xiaomi (BATX)) are doing so to be able to fully control the technology for their own  benefit. Governing both the data and the algorithms that process it appears to be necessary to  ensure that digitalisation is beneficial to European society. However, not understanding where  the data are located, how they are protected in transit or at rest (e.g. using encryption,  anonymisation and/or access control technologies) and how they are processed raises endless  suspicions regarding the soundness of the digital society. Such concerns have been raised by  the significant amounts of evidence on social platform incidents, such as the Cambridge  Analytica data scandal (19). Europe should ensure strategic autonomy by having trustworthy and  explainable AI systems. The area of  Data security is analysed in Section 3.1.  Lack of data. ‘The application of AI systems in Europe may be limited because of data  protection regulations.’ There is a strong belief that all problems are solvable, as long as vast  amounts of data are available and can be processed by powerful algorithms. For example, the  application of AI to medical data may significantly improve diagnosis and treatment. However,  Europe has strong privacy requirements that require data to be handled according to  regulations. Controlling access to and use of data is critical to ensuring that we have enough  data available to feed algorithms (and in the end command and control systems). As a side  note, access to data (e.g. data for cyber threat intelligence) is becoming critical for cybersecurity  operations. The areas of  Data security and cyber threat management are analysed in  Sections 3.1 and 3.3, respectively.  All of the abovementioned scenarios show how activities – in many cases critical activities –  may be disrupted and, when mapping such problems on a larger scale, may affect European  citizens as a whole. To preserve Europe’s strategic autonomy, which could be affected by such  problems, we should leverage our strong research and development workforce and our societal  values to develop and provide products and services that cover the EU’s needs and meet the  EU’s values.

KEY AREAS FOR  DEVELOPING THE EU’S  DIGITAL STRATEGIC  AUTONOMY  In this chapter, the seven most important knowledge areas that were defined through  consultation with the cybersecurity community are presented. The priorities are ranked by order  of preference by the community, the highest appearing first. A full list of all the knowledge areas  is available in Section A.2.  3.1.  DATA SECURITY  3.1.1. Current and future context of data security  As shown in the abovementioned scenario, every time Alice uses her smartphone she sends  information about her current location to the cloud. Alice provides information not only when she  travels but also when she shops, when she eats and when she works, since most of the  applications and services she uses collect information about her. Unfortunately, if she does not  provide these data, she will not be able to use these applications or services. To make matters  worse, Alice often has difficulties in understanding how much information she provides, when  she provides it, and for what reason this information is being used, beyond her current needs.  As if this was not enough, the deployment of home assistant devices, which listen to and may  potentially record every private conversation, may result in constant monitoring even inside our  homes. This constant monitoring will continue to feed AI algorithms aimed at taking care of all of  our human needs, from the simplest to the most complex.  3.1.2. Definition and criticality of the problem  AI is becoming the new driver of daily and critical services, such as powering energy production  and distribution, managing multimodal transport and piloting healthcare infrastructure. Without  trusting the data and the algorithms that process it, it is hard to imagine a trustworthy future for  our digital society. The issue in question is the risk of losing control over both information and  the algorithms that process it. Although the EU has taken the initiative to protect EU citizens’  Every morning, Alice fires up her preferred navigational application on her phone to navigate from  home to work. Without thinking about it, she provides information to the system about her location and  speed. In turn, the guidance system provides her with information about road conditions and the best  itinerary to reach her destination. The application may also assist her in selecting the best time of  departure, by estimating her time of arrival. However, does Alice know what kind of personal data she  provides and how these data are being processed?  CYBERSECURITY RESEARCH DIRECTIONS FOR  THE EU’S DIGITAL STRATEGIC AUTONOMY  April 2021  12  information by enforcing the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) (20), this loss of control  might have already happened to a certain extent, since many people worldwide rely on  services provided by GAFAM or BATX for both collecting and processing data.  With respect to data, the top cloud providers (Amazon, Microsoft, Google, SalesForce) are  based outside Europe. However, there is an imminent risk in this situation, as there are national  regulations, such as the Cloud Act (21) in the United States, that may force providers to grant  access to European citizens’ data. This goes against the provisions of regulations such as the  GDPR (22), which aims to protect the personal data of EU citizens. European and Member  States initiatives exist for launching a sovereign cloud (23), but their impact remains limited at  this stage, in terms of both market penetration and scope.  With respect to algorithms, we are also becoming used to treating algorithms as a cloud  commodity; namely, a lot of machine learning code relies on one or two very popular  libraries (24). Although this is very efficient for many software developers, providers of the  libraries could potentially gain power over information about software related to machine  learning (e.g. through information on downloads and requests for support). To make matters  worse, our focus on the results of the libraries may deprive us of our capability to understand  and develop the basic technology behind such libraries. Moreover, if the suppliers discontinue  development or maintenance of the libraries for internal reasons, this may affect countless  services that have a direct dependency on the libraries.

It uses Apache License 2.0,  so it may be hosted by third parties for download and may be further developed by the community. However, most  open-source projects are hosted on sites such as GitHub and NPM (both based in the United States).  https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2016/679/oj https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CLOUD_Act https://edpb.europa.eu/sites/edpb/files/files/file2/edpb_edps_joint_response_us_cloudact_annex.pdf https://vpnoverview.com/news/european-cloud-service-gaia-x-in-the-making/  CYBERSECURITY RESEARCH DIRECTIONS FOR  THE EU’S DIGITAL STRATEGIC AUTONOMY  April 2021  13  Although we interact with AI in our everyday lives, we are not always aware of how the learning process works.  Explainable and trustworthy AI algorithms that provide us with a clear understanding of how they are processing  data are needed.  CYBERSECURITY RESEARCH DIRECTIONS FOR  THE EU’S DIGITAL STRATEGIC AUTONOMY  April 2021  14  3.1.3. Efforts towards ensuring data security  Data protection is one of the rights enshrined in Article 8 of the EU Charter of Fundamental  Rights (25), and the introduction of the GDPR has created an obligation to protect EU personal  data. It has had a worldwide impact on countries and businesses, leading to changes in laws  and practices even outside Europe.  Several projects are tackling this aspect of the GDPR and tools related to it. For instance, the  PDP4E project (26) offers software, system engineer methods and software tools that allow  engineers to apply data protection principles in a more structured way to the projects they carry  out. The DITAS project (27) aims to provide content-based solutions to virtual data containers,  enabling secure computing at the edge. The Decode project (28) increases the digital strategic  autonomy of European citizens by enabling them to produce, access and control their data and  exchange contextualised information in real time and in a confidential and scalable manner. In  this context, ENISA has published a number of studies on the security of personal data (29) and,  in particular, cryptographic protocols and tools and their possible implementation in real-life  applications. Recently, ENISA has published new studies on security and privacy  considerations that arise from the use of autonomous agents (30) and best practice and  techniques for pseudonymisation (31). However, data security extends beyond the data  protection scheme and includes the security of any type of data in transit, in use and at rest.  Another notable European activity is the deployment of several regulatory frameworks that  formalise the needs and requirements of an EU digital economy. The recent ENISA mandate on  information technology (IT) certification schemes (32) should hopefully provide certain assurance  levels regarding digital products and services deployed in the EU, although the exact extent and  impact of this regulation remains to be evaluated.  It seems that these activities are supporting the development of privacy-aware regulations.  However, tools for managing personal data properly have not been disseminated widely, and  the security of algorithms that process data needs to be studied further.  Moreover, Europe has started to support research projects on developing technologies related  to AI (under, for example, the Horizon 2020 AI4EU (33) initiative) while making data openly  available to support the development of algorithms (e.g. through the open data pilot in Horizon  2020 and the Connecting Europe Facility (CEF) Telecom Public Open Data (34) call). Although  Europe is investing a significant amount of money in fundamental algorithms, this amount  seriously lags behind the amounts that other countries are investing.

Recommendations  To sustain and further develop its data-based digital economy, Europe should control key  technologies related to the following domains.   Understanding and mitigating vulnerabilities of AI. During sensing or processing,  machine learning algorithms are vulnerable to attacks (35); these are widely known in  the community and have also been demonstrated. The EU should invest in  technologies to prevent, detect and mitigate the impact of algorithmic vulnerabilities,  particularly in the context of control systems used in critical infrastructure.   Ensuring the availability of machine learning and big data platforms that are  sourced, hosted and sustainable in Europe. Europe should develop and encourage  sustainable AI platforms that (i) are always available, (ii) are easily accessible and (iii)  provide alternatives for EU-based services.   Developing new technologies for data security and privacy, to support advances  in regulations and the emerging needs of the digital society. As data are  becoming an active component of command and control processes, new techniques  should be developed to protect active data, regardless of syntax, semantics and  location. This includes, for example, computing on encrypted data, including multiparty  computation, functional encryption and somewhat homomorphic encryption (see  Section 3.5 for further details). The EU should invest, in particular, in technologies  favouring local/edge AI treatment to complement the investment that has already been  made in cloud-based treatment. This includes an increased focus on local AI agents,  namely developing methods and tools to support privacy-friendly global training,  deployment to edge and local execution of the AI algorithms – to the extent that this is  feasible.   Explainable AI. In many cases, AI algorithms are acting as a black box. For greater  social acceptance and technical certification purposes, it will become necessary to  trace the processes by which the algorithms reach a decision and explain these  processes to the user in an understandable manner. This extends to AI algorithms  training, and it may be combined with AI to protect the privacy of training data and user  data, as well as the model, although the latter is rather difficult to achieve. In addition,  providing open tools so that users can verify AI externally could support trustworthy AI  development and deployment. Such tools would be able to evaluate the AI by  executing built-in tests, in a similar way to how penetration testing tools work (such as  Metasploit).   Securing decision support and actuating. AI algorithms provide decisions based on  input data. An effort should be made to ensure secure sensing, in conjunction with  secure hardware (Section 3.4), secure actuating, and secure operating systems and  middleware (Section 3.2).   Social trustworthiness of AI. Current social networks exhibit many biases, without  the user being aware or conscious of them (36). Although the modern press has been  cross-checking facts to a greater extent, it does not meet the need to validate content  for correctness or appropriateness. The EU should support new techniques for  developing the trustworthiness of social online interactions, independently of the  service or platform.

Europe should  invest in  transparent,  trustworthy  information  processing for  its citizens and  businesses  regarding data  security.  CYBERSECURITY RESEARCH DIRECTIONS FOR  THE EU’S DIGITAL STRATEGIC AUTONOMY  April 2021  16  3.1.5. Long-term objectives  Data security needs to go beyond data at rest in the long term, protecting active data in an  environment without borders and well-defined lines. Data security also includes algorithms such  as AI and machine learning algorithms. Active data protection should cover information and  algorithms, from sensing to acting. Transparency provided by clarity of purpose, process and  result will increase trust and use. Success will lead to Europe establishing transparent,  trustworthy information processing for its citizens and businesses.  3.2.  TRUSTWORTHY SOFTWARE PLATFORMS  3.2.1. Current and future context of trustworthy software platforms  Software is progressively penetrating all aspects of everyday life, from the smallest objects  (such as light bulbs) to the most complex ones (for example vehicles). As demonstrated by the  abovementioned scenario, essential software, trusted to fulfil daily needs – such as the  operating system in Bob’s car – may be compromised for various reasons, betraying the user’s  trust. In this scenario, Bob may no longer be able to operate his car safely if he installs  questionable code.  Software is at the heart of digital infrastructure, and nowadays with the DevOps paradigm it is  being put into production almost at the same time as it is being written. New software  development paradigms such as Agile and SCRUM are entering the critical infrastructure  domain (37). Vulnerabilities in these environments may have terrible cascading effects. As proof,  a recent set of 11 vulnerabilities touching the VxWorks real-time operating system and reaching  the maximum severity level has affected many industrial control systems (ICS) vendors (38). This  is only one example from roughly 15 000 software vulnerabilities published yearly in the  Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) repository (39).  Although quite a number of new operating systems, virtualisation platforms and middleware  systems have been developed and introduced in the past few years (such as Android,  OpenStack), only very few of them have a European origin. Platforms such as the RIOT  operating system (40) remain confidential and are for research use only. Although many global  European companies develop software and integrate it into their systems, the number of world-  class software vendors headquartered in Europe is scarce.  3.2.2. Problem definition and criticality  With the introduction of computing and communication abilities in the majority of items utilised  daily, Europe may become vulnerable to supply chain disruptions. For instance, Google has  partially suspended business with China; it is no longer providing services for Huawei, except  for those publicly available via open licence sourcing (41). It is not clear how Europe will respond  (37) Kasauli, R., Knauss, E., Kanagwa, B., Nilsson, A. and Calikli, G., ‘Safety-critical systems and agile development: A  mapping study’, paper presented at the 44th Euromicro Conference on Software Engineering and Advanced  Applications (SEAA), Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, 3 August 2018, pp. 470-477  (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1807.07800.pdf).

A new operating system software update is  available! The vehicle starts downloading the update and attempts to install it. Unfortunately, the  update is not compatible with a third-party application, leading Bob to seek an alternative solution.

Indeed,  responding to such an event requires significant effort and might introduce large additional  costs. We are at a point where, despite the noteworthy number of software developers and  software companies residing in Europe, we cannot ensure that we will be able to replace  essential software components should the ones currently deployed become unavailable.  Software is increasingly consumed as a cloud service. However, as previously noted, the major  cloud platforms are located outside Europe. This creates several problems. First, such vendors  may restrict the availability of their software services to their own clouds only, creating lock-ins  for both functionalities and data. Second, they could also prohibit third-party software vendors  from creating native software services on their cloud platforms. If Europe were to lose access to  these cloud platforms, it would consequently lose access to the software services that are  exclusive to them.  Furthermore, systems and services rely on third-party libraries and services that are  independent and beyond the control of the software developers. As an example, even a major  software vendor such as SAP today controls only a small portion of the source code in its  products and relies on open-source software for over 90 % of its products’ functionality; it is  therefore developing tools for vulnerability management of this external software (42).  3.2.3. Efforts towards establishing trustworthy software platforms  Many initiatives have taken place in Europe with the aim of publishing and supporting open-  source platforms. However, some of these initiatives have failed; the Mandriva Linux  distribution, for example, failed as the company supporting it went bankrupt a few years ago.  The most popular Linux distribution providing commercial support is currently the Red Hat  Enterprise Linux, whose headquarters are located outside the EU, followed by the SUSE Linux,  which is supported by SUSE, a company based in Germany. The mF2C project (43) has set the  goal of designing an open, secure, decentralised, multi-stakeholder management framework,  including novel programming models, privacy and security, data storage techniques, service  creation, brokerage solutions, service-level agreement (SLA) policies and resource  orchestration methods.  In effect, although Europe has a booming ICT service industry, it hosts only a few of the top  commercial software companies and supports relatively few open-source software distributions.  This is creating a potential supply chain issue, as Europe may not have a sufficient expert  workforce and enough companies to develop software solutions to meet its needs.  3.2.4. Recommendations  Europe must be able to develop its own software platforms and tools to adequately verify  software that is sourced from outside its borders. Likewise, Europe should support, promote and  host, inside its borders, open-source alternatives to commercial products, to be able to cope in  the event of supply chain disruption. Finally, as the demand for cloud services grows, Europe  must ensure an open and secure European cloud software services market.  (42) https://projects.eclipse.org/proposals/eclipse-steady  (43) https://www.mf2c-project.eu/  https://projects.eclipse.org/proposals/eclipse-steady https://www.mf2c-project.eu/  CYBERSECURITY RESEARCH DIRECTIONS FOR  THE EU’S DIGITAL STRATEGIC AUTONOMY  April 2021  18  More specific action items include the following:   Trustworthy operating systems. Europe should ensure that it maintains its expertise  on operating systems development, even if the scope is limited to specific  environments, such as cyber physical systems and secure components. It should  encourage the emergence of open-source alternatives for servers, desktops and  mobile devices.   Trustworthy middleware. Nowadays, software systems rely on third-party libraries  and services that are independent and beyond the control of software developers.  Europe needs to be able to validate these third-party libraries and services to ensure  that they do not introduce additional software vulnerabilities into the system (44).   Detection of malware and botnets. Particularly for sensitive environments such as  governmental systems and critical infrastructure, Europe needs to maintain the  capability (in terms of both expertise and tooling) to detect malware and malicious  network activity.   System and virtualisation security. As virtual environments gain in popularity and  become commodities, Europe must retain the capability to specify and enforce  cybersecurity properties in hypervisors. This is linked to cybersecurity aspects of  network operating systems and routing equipment, which are described in Section 3.7.   Secure software development platforms. Europe should maintain the capability to  develop, assess and certify secure software, possibly built from several third-party  sources. This includes (i) the capability to build secure software systems and (ii) the  ability to ensure that the systems that are built meet specific security requirements.  This depends on ‘trustworthy middleware’, which can help ensure that third-party  libraries and services are also secure.   Risk assessment platforms. To ensure the security of complex ICT systems, there is  a need to assess the risks of potential attacks, in order to define the necessary  countermeasures during both design time and runtime. Measuring the achieved level  of security is a difficult task. This task also includes assessing the dependencies on the  system (both software and hardware).   Trustworthy sensors. Software platforms should support secure command and  control infrastructure that cooperates with hardware-based sensing and actuating  (Section 3.4), as well as AI-based decision support (Section 3.1). This could be a  component of secure software and configuration updates.   Open-cloud software services. Europe needs to create an open market for cloud  software services and enable the same cloud services to be available across different  cloud providers. This would protect Europeans from being locked in to a particular  cloud service, enable European software vendors to offer cloud services and protect  Europe from losing access to critical software services should certain clouds become  unavailable.  (44) https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/OWASP_Top_Ten_2017/Top_10-2017_A9- Using_Components_with_Known_Vulnerabilities.html  Europe must be  able to develop  its own software  platforms and  tools to  adequately verify  software that is  sourced from  outside its  borders.  https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/OWASP_Top_Ten_2017/Top_10-2017_A9-Using_Components_with_Known_Vulnerabilities.html https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/OWASP_Top_Ten_2017/Top_10-2017_A9-Using_Components_with_Known_Vulnerabilities.html  CYBERSECURITY RESEARCH DIRECTIONS FOR  THE EU’S DIGITAL STRATEGIC AUTONOMY  April 2021  19  Although most attacks exploit a system’s vulnerabilities, social engineering attacks exploit human weaknesses.  One of the defence measures against social engineering attacks is raising people’s awareness.  CYBERSECURITY RESEARCH DIRECTIONS FOR  THE EU’S DIGITAL STRATEGIC AUTONOMY  April 2021  20  3.2.5. Long-term objective  The long-term objective of trustworthy software platforms is to ensure that deployed software is  of sufficient quality and is developed following the ‘secure-by-design’ and ‘secure-by-default’  principles. The EU should facilitate not only the development of methods and tools for  accomplishing this goal but also the development of training programmes for skilled software  developers. Of course, the security properties of these trustworthy platforms should be  maintained during the whole lifecycle of the products and services into which they are  integrated, at a time when the lifetime of embedded systems is increasing significantly. These  actions could be supported by enhanced assessment and certification methodologies for  specific application scenarios (45).  3.3.  CYBER THREAT MANAGEMENT AND RESPONSE  3.3.1. Current and future context of cyber threat management and  response  In the abovementioned scenario, malware tricked the user and was used to gain access to the  internal network of the company. Such malicious actions may cause extensive damage to  company assets, such as loss of data due to the encryption of a hard drive, when the assets are  not protected and the SOC is not prepared to respond to such a cyber-incident.  The area of operational security, also known as incident management, started in the early  1980s, with the understanding that completely secure systems were not achievable, at least not  at a reasonable cost and while allowing ease of use. The concept of an intrusion detection  system (46) that is able to detect malicious behaviours (such as malicious code or activities) has  evolved over the years.  The tools have evolved rapidly since the late 1990s into large platforms that combine a number  of technologies. Security information and event management (SIEM) platforms collect events  from many sensors and help operators classify alerts and evaluate the associated risk. Security  orchestration, automation and response (SOAR) platforms augment the capabilities of SIEM  platforms with regard to automation and response.  3.3.2. Problem definition and criticality  During the past 20 years, there has been a significant development of tools for intrusion  detection. However, the difficulty of deploying and operating these tools has led to the  (45) Baseline security recommendations have been developed by ENISA. For example, for IoT devices, see ENISA,  Baseline Security Recommendations for IoT, 2017 (https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/baseline-security- recommendations-for-iot).  (46) Denning, D. E., ‘An intrusion-detection model’, IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering, No 2, 1987, pp. 222– 232.  Claire arrives at work and logs in to the computer system. She receives an email from her boss, with a  document attached. Without realising that the email address subtly mimics the one from her boss, she  opens the document. Unknown to her, the document contains malware that infects her computer and  starts scanning the network surroundings. By finding shared folders and a vulnerable Active Directory  server, the malware gains administrative access to the system and starts encrypting the Active  Directory server’s hard drive. In the Security Operations Centre (SOC), alarms start flashing as  machines and network connectivity go down. What will the operator do to remediate the situation?  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/baseline-security-recommendations-for-iot https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/baseline-security-recommendations-for-iot  CYBERSECURITY RESEARCH DIRECTIONS FOR  THE EU’S DIGITAL STRATEGIC AUTONOMY  April 2021  21  emergence of SOCs as managed security services to facilitate deployment and operations for  organisations that do not have the skills and funds to deploy such services.  At the same time, legislation such as the Network and Information Security (NIS) Directive (47)  and its national implementations require that critical infrastructure operators report cybersecurity  incidents to the authorities and inform their peers through Information Sharing and Analysis  Centres (ISACs). Europe needs to preserve and develop the ability to design and deploy EU-  designed detection sensors in its most critical infrastructure. It also needs to preserve its ability  to design and deploy SIEM and SOAR platforms, including open-source alternatives when  commercial components cannot be sourced in Europe. These tools, and the workforce behind  them, have thus become a critical resource that is fragmented by the variety and number of  environments in which the tools must be deployed for monitoring.  The need to protect our critical infrastructure was also exposed during the COVID-19 pandemic.  This is particularly the case for our medical care infrastructure, which experienced stress as a  result of the number of patients needing treatment. The high impact that a cybersecurity incident  could have on a medical centre poses a great risk that could put even more stress on medical  care systems. Taking out a hospital’s cyber systems during a crisis could result in medical staff  losing access to patient records, medical cyber equipment being taken out of service, and  medical surgeries being halted, consequently putting human lives in danger.  Although the challenge is encountered worldwide, operating SOCs is a strategic autonomy  issue, as it depends on people and processes. With respect to people, Europe appears to suffer  from a significant shortage of a skilled workforce to operate SOCs and manage cybersecurity  incidents. Unfortunately, a delay in diagnosis and response may result in attackers (i)  penetrating systems more easily, (ii) residing inside the systems for longer periods of time and  (iii) being able to inflict significant damage. With respect to processes, SOCs handle vast  amounts of log and trace data, possibly containing very sensitive information on EU companies  and citizens. Processing these data locally and sharing information among well-identified circles  of trust for mitigating cyber threats, in compliance with the applicable EU regulatory frameworks,  is also an asset that needs to be protected.  3.3.3. Efforts towards ensuring cyber threat management and response  Research on cyberattack detection and mitigation has been, and is still, a hot topic because of  the mutations of attacks. New tools and new detection and correlation mechanisms are required  to respond to the increasing complexity of attacks.  At the same time, the digitalisation of society is introducing digital controls in many new places.  As a result, attackers have more possibilities of gaining easy access, as product designers tend  to focus more on functionality and less on security. This is demonstrated by, for example, the  fact that, from 2017 to 2018, 80 % of the vulnerabilities found in medical devices were exploiting  network access and 40 % could be triggered remotely with basic skills and no particular  privileges (48). Consequently, although there has been significant progress, in terms of both  technology and regulations, a significant gap between attackers and defenders remains,  especially in certain sectors.  (47) https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/nis-directive  (48) Debar, H., Vulnerabilities in the Internet of Medical Things, FOSAD, 2019.  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/nis-directive  CYBERSECURITY RESEARCH DIRECTIONS FOR  THE EU’S DIGITAL STRATEGIC AUTONOMY  April 2021  22  Several research projects have addressed the issue of SOCs and SIEM platforms. The DiSIEM  project (49) aims to extend existing SIEM platforms by providing a set of diversity-related  components to improve their capacities. The Cyber-Trust project (50) aims to develop an  innovative cyber threat intelligence gathering, detection and mitigation platform to tackle the  grand challenges of securing the ecosystem of IoT devices. The ReAct project (51) aims to fight  software exploitation and mitigate advanced cybersecurity threats in a timely fashion.  Although the sector of cyber threat management and response has made significant progress,  the effectiveness of attack detection and mitigation remains plagued by a large volume of false  alerts (reducing SOC effectiveness) and undetected advanced persistent threats. New solutions  are needed to support defenders who have to deal with the increasing number and complexity  of attacks.

CYBERSECURITY RESEARCH DIRECTIONS FOR  THE EU’S DIGITAL STRATEGIC AUTONOMY  April 2021  24  3.3.4. Recommendations  Europe must be able to develop its own tools and methods for attack detection and response to  incidents in order to be able to resist and mitigate cyberattacks. The development of new  devices and new services is creating new vulnerabilities and attack paths, for which we may not  have the right detection mechanisms. Industrial control systems are going online and creating  new attack scenarios that have not been considered before. This capability is increasingly  important when facing nation state actors or handling systemic threats. Specific action items  include the following.   Cyber threat intelligence. Europe has invested a significant amount of effort in cyber  threat intelligence, for example the Malware Information Sharing Platform (52) and the  OpenCTI (53) open-source software. These efforts should be sustained to ensure that  Europe is able to influence standards currently under development at the Internet  Engineering Task Force (IETF) or the European Telecommunications Standards  Institute (ETSI).   Cybersecurity analytics. The wealth of information acquired in SOCs remains  enormous, posing a significant challenge to operators. New cybersecurity analytic tools  leveraging machine learning, AI and visualisation should support operators in  assessing and triaging alerts quickly and efficiently, thus improving the response.   Situational awareness. Given the complexity and diversity of current IT systems,  SIEM and SOAR platforms should be extended to offer operators a complete view of  the situation. This aspect also includes developing methods to raise the awareness  and improve the training of operators, to enable them to keep up with the threats. New  data streams, coming from, for example, ISACs, will also assist operators to become  acquainted with the application sector view.   Attack detection, mitigation and response. Current sensors may suffer from false  positives and false negatives and therefore may not detect multiple cyberattacks  effectively. Furthermore, many new platforms do not include endpoint protection (such  as smartphones), and thus are missing detection and mitigation capabilities. The  impact of and response to cyberattacks, from a technical, legal, business and human  standpoint, requires further study. Automated response procedures should be further  examined regarding technical feasibility and possible legal implications. Moreover,  strategies regarding incident response that require the cooperation of several  stakeholders with different levels of administrative control should be developed. These  strategies could take into account several utility functions.   Deception. Although use of the word ‘honeypot’ has decreased in recent years, new  deception techniques could be developed and prove to be effective at triggering alerts  related to malicious activity and protecting legitimate systems from exposure. This area  could include exploring adversarial machine learning techniques to learn more about  attackers leveraging AI tools to deploy advanced attack schemes.   Cyber defence. It has already been demonstrated that critical infrastructure could  suffer greatly from heavy attacks; therefore, it is necessary to think ahead and plan  protection mechanisms and operating modes that enable the infrastructure to ‘fail  gracefully’ and operate in the best possible manner in a degraded or even manual  mode.   Post-design and post-perimeter defence and response strategies. The perimeter  of many of our organisations is becoming increasingly vague as practices such as  (52) Malware Information Sharing Platform (https://www.misp-project.org/).  (53) OpenCTI – open cyber threat intelligence platform (https://www.opencti.io/en/).  Europe should  develop its own  tools and  methods for  attack detection  and incident  response.  https://www.misp-project.org/ https://www.opencti.io/en/  CYBERSECURITY RESEARCH DIRECTIONS FOR  THE EU’S DIGITAL STRATEGIC AUTONOMY  April 2021  25  smart working gain in popularity. As a result, strategies for protection, mitigation and  response must be adapted to these trends.   Trusted information sharing. Beyond technology, there is a need to establish and  foster trusted forums for cyber threat information exchange, whereby data on incidents  can be shared to a limited community in a detailed manner. The ISACs already  mentioned are key actors in developing these community forums and improving  Europe’s cybersecurity readiness.  3.3.5. Long-term objectives  Europe should try to remain autonomous in the long term, as far as cyber threat management  and response are concerned. Autonomy refers to capabilities and capacity related to SOCs,  including skills and training programmes, SIEM platforms, managed security services and cyber  threat intelligence information acquisition. This is a prerequisite condition, to ensure that  digitalisation of society conforms to our needs and values and does not induce unacceptable  cyber threats. The priorities should be balanced between prevention, for instance hardening  current systems and building trustworthy software and hardware components (Sections 3.2 and  3.4, respectively), and efficient responses to incidents, which requires people who are well  trained and who are able to react in the event of an attack (cyber response and capacity  building). This balance is fundamental to preserving the practical use of IT and cyberphysical  systems. Success will enable Europe to retain sufficient autonomy to fight against major  cyberattacks and actors that pose a threat.  3.4.  TRUSTWORTHY HARDWARE PLATFORMS  3.4.1. Current and future context of trustworthy hardware platforms  Suppliers, many of them located outside Europe, are increasingly introducing new features such  as secure boot, image signing and unique device identity in their hardware platforms. Although  they were introduced to increase the security of devices, these features might undermine  usability, making it difficult for the end user to understand the added value in terms of benefits  and drawbacks. Moreover, as demonstrated by the abovementioned scenario, such features  may not be trustworthy, since additional testing may be needed to validate the absence of bugs  and exploits.  At the same time, complex attacks involving hardware implementation or hardware/software  interactions (such as Spectre (54), Meltdown (55) and Rowhammer (56)) are becoming a threat to  extremely popular hardware platforms. Although fixes are available for a few of them, an  extensive fix without significant performance loss remains out of reach at the time of writing this  report.

Daniel has just acquired a brand-new smartphone with an advanced security feature enabling him to  store his private data and prevent applications from accessing it. Unfortunately, this functionality has a  significant flaw. If the smartphone is dropped in water, it triggers a hardware bug that attackers can  exploit to gain access to his personal data.  CYBERSECURITY RESEARCH DIRECTIONS FOR  THE EU’S DIGITAL STRATEGIC AUTONOMY  April 2021  26  Any system may feature hardware or software side bugs or vulnerabilities. To minimise security incidents, software  should be kept up to date, and trustworthy hardware platforms should be used. In addition, an appropriate  configuration is needed to increase security.  * Network intrusion detection system (NIDS)  *  CYBERSECURITY RESEARCH DIRECTIONS FOR  THE EU’S DIGITAL STRATEGIC AUTONOMY  April 2021  27  3.4.2. Problem definition and criticality  Sourcing hardware components manufactured in Europe is a rarity nowadays, as manufacturers  have moved their production to Asia. European countries have failed to provide incentives to  suppliers of chipsets to persuade them not to relocate production to Asia, even though there is a  risk of intellectual property (IP) rights violation (57) and tampering (58) (59). Vendors and suppliers  outsource various aspects of design, fabrication, testing and packaging of integrated circuits  (ICs). This widens the threat scenarios, which now include malicious insertion of Trojan circuits,  designed to act as silicon time bombs, IC piracy, untrustworthy third-party IPs and malicious  system disruption and diversion (60). As a result, there is an increasing risk that hardware  components including backdoors or undesired functionality might be exploited by an attacker,  while the verification of the vulnerabilities in hardware is expensive and time-consuming, and  unfeasible for the majority of chips.  Moreover, the EU supply chain for the ICT industry might be disrupted or lose its competitive  edge if component suppliers from other continents decide to follow aggressive selling methods,  such as using different price strategies for the European market or, even worse, restricting the  possibility of buying certain components.  In the near future, operating fleets of drones or vehicles with remote secure management will be  challenging without a local ‘trust anchor’. A trust anchor is a hardware anchor that bridges  communication between an operating system and hardware, integrating a highly secure system  on a chip for holistic system defence. The anchor helps an operating system kernel to actively  monitor its extensions and can also track bus traffic within the system-on-a-chip platform to  prevent untrusted third-party IP modules from performing malicious operations (61) and thus  causing security challenges. As an example, the SecureIoT project (62) aims to provide security  services in the areas of Industry 4.0, socially assistive robots and connected autonomous cars.  Sharing hardware platforms in virtualised environments, as envisaged for the future 5G  networks (see Section 3.7), enables attackers to leverage hardware vulnerabilities. Maintaining  hardware expertise is crucial to ensuring that Europe develops its own IoT infrastructure,  sourced from locally designed components.  Consequently, it is of paramount importance that Europe sources its own trustworthy hardware,  not only to secure its supply chain and competitive edge but also to possess the capacity to  control secure infrastructure of the future, from autonomous drones and vehicles to 5G networks  and power grids.

Efforts towards establishing trustworthy hardware platforms  Europe is a global leader in security relating to embedded systems, from smart card security to  other embedded platforms. There is also a strong level of expertise in micro-architecture attacks  among European research teams. For example, the FutureTPM project (63) aims to design and  develop a quantum-resistant trusted platform module (TPM). However, investment in hardware,  and particularly secure hardware, seems to have been limited since the development (and  widespread commercialisation) of smart cards and SIM cards. It is relevant to come back to  hardware and examine if, given these new threats, Europe can maintain its edge with regard to  the development of secure hardware components. Acquisitions and merging of European  companies by non-European players might affect our autonomy in procuring critical  components. In fact, in 2017, 30 % of the acquired European small and medium-sized  enterprises (SMEs) – market leaders in specialised high-tech areas – were acquired by non-EU  companies (64). In such cases, (i) the EU loses know-how, (ii) the IP moves outside Europe and  (iii) the European industry becomes dependent on imported components.  3.4.4. Recommendations  There are many ways in which hardware tools could support and improve cybersecurity as a  whole. Specific action items include the following.   Bootstrap security. Research and design new methods to ensure the continuous  integrity of hardware/software platforms, ensuring smooth operation and secure  transition from hardware to firmware to software, during the whole lifecycle of a product  (design, manufacturing, maintenance).   Hardware-induced vulnerabilities. Design and develop methods for detecting and  remediating hardware-induced vulnerabilities, as well as hardware trojans, to ensure  strong platform integrity. Black/white box testing technologies for hardware should be  studied extensively.   Side channel attacks. Detect and protect platforms that may leak information because  of radiation or power consumption, and certify those that are less prone to leakage.  This topic has been studied in either very small (smart card) or very specific (military)  contexts and lacks wider applicability.   Hardware-anchored cybersecurity tools. Hardware remains one of the best trust  anchors available, but it has significant costs. Efficient (cost, energy) hardware support  for cybersecurity is a difficult challenge, but one that also holds significant promises for  more secure platforms. This may form the basis required for strong authentication  (which has remained elusive so far) and global identity management (including not only  people but also businesses, objects and services). Research into new approaches  beyond public key infrastructure should also allow massive deployment of secure  hardware with reduced complexity.   Open hardware architecture. The example of the RISC-V foundation (65)  demonstrates that it is possible to develop and share hardware architecture openly.  This model should support Europe in developing alternative hardware supply chains in  the event of difficulties with the current supply.

Post-treatments, typically AI, require that sensors provide reliable  information further up the chain. However, attacks are targeting sensors more and  more, for example computer vision (66). Europe should explore the development of  reliable and secure sensing technologies.  3.4.5. Long-term objective  The long-term objective of trustworthy hardware platforms is to ensure that the EU possesses  the capability and capacity to guarantee access and control over high-quality hardware  components, in order to meet its industrial development needs as such components become  key in almost all products and services that are being developed and commercialised.  Moreover, the Cybersecurity Act (67) enables ENISA to establish a European cybersecurity  certification framework for ICT products, services and processes that provides different levels of  assurance.  3.5.  CRYPTOGRAPHY  3.5.1. Current and future context of cryptography  Cryptography is one of the leading areas of research in Europe and one of the most advanced  theoretical areas of cybersecurity, relying on models and formal proofs for verification and  validation.  In the cryptographic community, competitions are being organised to develop new algorithms.  Since 2017, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has been running a  competition for quantum-safe cryptographic algorithms, with the process expected to be  completed in accordance with NIST standards during the period 2022–2024 (68). The selected  algorithms will guarantee that the confidentiality and integrity of the data are protected from  attacks by conventional and quantum computers. It is critical during the standardisation process  that all weaknesses are properly analysed and reviewed through peer review in a transparent  manner, which has not always been the case (69).  Mastering cryptography is a key element for nation states, and acquisition of technology from  third parties is a significant weakness, as shown by the story of the Crypto AG company (70).  Given the importance of strong cryptographic algorithms and protocols to national security,  many EU Member States have created national crypto strategies to ensure long-term access to  state-of-the-art crypto tools. Unfortunately, this has limited the possibility of publishing lists of  recommended cryptographic algorithms and protocols that are valid in all Member States, and  has thus created fragmentations in the single market.

(70) https://www.cryptomuseum.com/manuf/crypto/index.htm  One of the most singular characteristics of the art of deciphering is the strong conviction possessed by  every person, even moderately acquainted with it, that he is able to construct a cipher which nobody else  can decipher.

Problem definition and criticality  Cryptographic algorithms are one of the fundamental pillars of cybersecurity, providing basic  properties such as integrity, confidentiality and authentication of origin. Although cryptography is  increasingly being used in classic IT, its use in industrial controls, which are often used in critical  infrastructure, has been limited. Issues are related to the difficulty of upgrading legacy  equipment, whose lifespan is counted in decades, and using cryptographic tools in power-  constrained devices. For example, encrypting or signing data requires additional computing  power, which is sometimes not available in resource- or power-limited devices. In addition, all  cryptographic material needs to be maintained, for example by regularly renewing keys, and the  overheads of management procedures are often difficult to manage. These challenges remain  difficult to solve at the extreme ends of the usage spectrum, for example for hardware-  constrained tiny devices relying on the environment to obtain energy and for high-speed  environments requiring encryption at the speed of memory or cache.  Despite their advantages and formal validation, cryptographic algorithms and protocols  sometimes fail. In this respect, the example of the key reinstallation attacks (KRACKs)  vulnerability (71) shows that even seemingly insignificant deviations from the proven process  lead to serious vulnerabilities; this core protocol issue had significant additional effects on the  features of newer protocols as they leveraged the older functionality (72).  Recent announcements of quantum computers and testbeds by companies such as Intel,  Google, IBM and ATOS indicate that it will become necessary to prepare quantum-resistant  cryptographic algorithms and protocols. Europe is contributing to the trend in the quantum  flagship (73). Since legacy cryptographic algorithms, protocols and suites require a significant  amount of time to become deprecated, and their replacements also require a significant amount  of time to be deployed, maintaining Europe’s capabilities in cryptography necessitates forward-  thinking and planning.  Beyond cryptographic algorithms and protocols, the EU should also invest in supporting  infrastructure, such as public key certificate authorities. Today, the top free and commercial  certificate authorities (Let’s Encrypt (74), Comodo, Symantec, Digicert, GeoTrust (75)) represent a  cumulative 97 % of the market share and are located outside the EU. Controlling the keys and  the infrastructure is required to ensure the confidentiality and availability of our communications.

Not having control of the encryption or signature keys puts a  system’s security at risk and affects the trust it has established with other systems.  CYBERSECURITY RESEARCH DIRECTIONS FOR  THE EU’S DIGITAL STRATEGIC AUTONOMY  April 2021  32  3.5.3. Efforts towards establishing strong cryptography  A number of European projects, such as the Networks of Excellence, have worked towards  fortifying Europe in the area of cryptography. The EU-funded Ecrypt I and Ecrypt II Networks of  Excellence (76) organised a competition to create a new stream cipher; the Fentec project (77) is  developing new solutions for functional encryption, providing new cryptographic building blocks  for privacy-sensitive applications.  Cryptographic functions and protocols have become mainstream for information systems.  Today, most web traffic is secured by the Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS),  although the underlying protocol has changed over the past 25 years from Secure Sockets  Layer (SSL) to Transport Layer Security version 1.3 (TLSv1.3). Issues related to other  fundamental protocols such as the Domain Name System (DNS) and the Border Gateway  Protocol (BGP) need to be addressed, but the process of introducing secure alternatives to  existing fundamental infrastructure is very slow (78). For example, despite the fact that the  current version of the DNS security extensions protocol was standardised between 2005 and  2013, the validation rate of domain names worldwide was less than 30 % (79) in April 2020.  Although significant progress has been made with regard to algorithms and protocols, the  overall infrastructure required to operate them remains insufficient. For example, public key  infrastructure and certificate distribution remain mostly in the private sector, and the level of trust  that can be associated with certificates remains difficult to evaluate, as shown by the example of  the DigiNotar failure (80).  3.5.4. Recommendations  As computing power, memory and mathematical tools progress, it is clear that cryptographic  algorithms and protocols are aging and thus becoming weaker. Research and standardisation in  cryptography should, therefore, continue to ensure that the available tools are efficient when  faced with emerging computing paradigms. Specific action items include the following.   Post-quantum cryptography. Although they are probably still far away from  commercial (or even practical) use, quantum computers are starting to appear in  specific settings. This new paradigm implies a complete rethinking of cryptographic  structures, and this can be considered an opportunity for a global refresh of our  cryptographic tools, enabling their use in environments in which they cannot currently  be deployed.   Basic cryptographic building blocks. Cryptographic tools need to be adapted to the  new environments, applications and domains in which we want to use them. For  example, fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) remains extremely expensive and  beyond reach, despite its promise to secure cloud environments. Research is  necessary to either develop alternative and more efficient homomorphic encryption  schemes, such as somewhat homomorphic encryption, or adapt algorithms to new  applications.   Standards-based maintenance of cryptographic suites. Standards frequently  specify cryptographic suites, enabling authentication and confidentiality in a  homogeneous and coherent way. As time passes, certain cryptographic suites weaken  and must be updated, to remove compromised algorithms or to increase key lengths.

Europe should lead crypto- standardisation  activities by proposing scientifically sound  algorithms and fostering consensus among European solutions.   Cryptographic protocols. As new services and uses emerge, new protocols such as  multiparty computation (MPC) and zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) are required to  ensure that these new services are sufficiently secure by design and that they maintain  user trust by avoiding a single point of failure and reducing the risk of leaks. This  entails also developing new dedicated symmetric building blocks to increase efficiency.   Tools to support security validation of cryptographic implementations. Tools are  needed to ensure that the progress made through stronger cryptography actually  translates into secure implementations.   Strong EU certification authority. The EU and its Member States should reflect on  the implementation of an EU-based public key infrastructure.  3.5.5. Long-term objectives  To ensure that the EU retains access to state-of-the-art cryptographic protection, we must invest  in the ability to establish, control and verify standards for processes and products that are vital  to Europe. This may include establishing European-based cryptographic suites to ensure  control over IP and limit the risk of hidden issues, such as cryptographic backdoors.  In the long term, as cryptographic algorithms and protocols and the supporting certificates are  so fundamental to cybersecurity, Europe should develop its own crypto policy and infrastructure  for public good.  3.6.  USER-CENTRIC SECURITY PRACTICES AND TOOLS  3.6.1. Current and future context of user-centric security practices and tools  It is a well-known issue that users are, in many cases, the weak point of organisations. Phishing  attacks continuously result in (i) organisations being infected with malware and (ii) private user  accounts being hijacked (81).  Security seems to be a very complicated and annoying topic for the standard IT user. The  problem of security has existed for a long time, as exemplified by studies led in the late 1990s  on email encryption (82) that received the test-of-time award 20 years after. We need to  acknowledge that, at present, a significant number of users, if not most of them, do not use a  secure email system that provides guarantees about the senders of messages and the integrity  of the content. Further to this discrepancy, which leads to spam and phishing, email use is  widespread for both personal and professional use.  (81) Caputo, D. D., Pfleeger, S. L., Freeman, J. D. and Johnson, M. E., ‘Going spear phishing: Exploring embedded  training and awareness’, IEEE Security & Privacy, Vol. 12, No 1, 2013, pp. 28–38.  (82) Whitten, A. and Tygar, J. D., ‘Why Johnny can’t encrypt: A usability evaluation of PGP 5.0’, in USENIX Security  Symposium, Vol. 348, 1999, pp. 169–184.  Never give an order that cannot be obeyed.  ― General Douglas MacArthur  It takes 20 years to build a reputation and few minutes of cyber-incident to ruin it.  ― Stéphane Nappo, Chief Information Security Officer, BNP  CYBERSECURITY RESEARCH DIRECTIONS FOR  THE EU’S DIGITAL STRATEGIC AUTONOMY  April 2021  34  It appears that productivity and personal interest are considered a higher priority than  cybersecurity and that users may reach their goals in creative ways, circumventing any security  system.  3.6.2. Problem definition and criticality  Many studies show that phishing and ransomware attacks have a significant economic  impact (83). In recent years, the WannaCry ransomware has shut down factories in France and  hospitals in the United Kingdom (84), resulting in serious economic losses and potentially having  a negative impact on human lives.  Cybersecurity tools are perceived as a burden to end users. Users tend to believe that such  tools reduce productivity, without bringing useful benefits. A recent study shows that even  cybersecurity experts cannot agree on what simple advice can be given to users to improve  their safety online (85).  We are at a point where people trust IT systems because they work, most of the time, and  because their dysfunctions are a notable nuisance without being an unbearable burden. Trust,  however, is difficult to obtain and easy to degrade. Cyber physical systems must improve their  usability so that users do not see themselves as being constrained by the systems and continue  using them for Europe to obtain the benefits of the digital society.  3.6.3. Efforts towards establishing user-centric security practices and tools  Several projects have already started in this area. For example, the Encase project (86) aims to  design and implement browser-based architecture for the protection of minors from malicious  actors in online social networks. The Privacy & Us project (87) aims to train early-stage  researchers to be able to analyse, design and develop innovative solutions to questions related  to the protection of citizens’ privacy, considering the multidisciplinary and intersectoral aspects  of the issue. The Dogana project (88) aims to reduce the risk created by modern Social  Engineering 2.0 attack techniques. Such projects may have outcomes that will benefit standard  users’ everyday interactions with IT systems by reducing the risk of attacks.  An enormous number of cybersecurity systems have been developed over the years, and many  of them have failed when it comes to deployment. There are many well-known examples, such  as the 20 years it took to develop usable standards to secure the internet-routing protocol BGP,  which are still not widely used. There are many such standards awaiting deployment, and many  security systems, which do more to burden the users than to solve their problems. The example  of completely automated public Turing test to tell computers and humans apart (CAPTCHA) is  particularly interesting, as we have known for a long time that tests of this kind are more easily  broken by algorithms than solved by users (89), which has led to them being used more in the  creation of ground truth for image processing systems than as access control mechanisms.

Consequently, it is important that systems let users maintain their  privacy and request consent before sharing private information.  CYBERSECURITY RESEARCH DIRECTIONS FOR  THE EU’S DIGITAL STRATEGIC AUTONOMY  April 2021  36  3.6.4. Recommendations  Many actions need to be taken to change the playing field and transform cybersecurity from a  burden to an asset that helps systems function better, deliver better digital services and provide  a clear benefit to end users. Europe should ensure that services that are useful for European  citizens either are available in Europe according to European values or favour the emergence of  alternatives that respect these values. Specific action items include research to develop the  following.   Privacy-enhancing technologies (PET). Develop practices and tools that support  users in preserving online privacy. Research should ensure that users can easily  enforce regulations such as the GDPR.   Usable security. Develop cybersecurity methods and tools that actually meet users’  needs and that support their activities instead of acting as barriers to productivity.   Human-centred security and privacy. Ensure that the end user is indeed the subject  who needs to be protected.   Security visibility. Design user interfaces and interactions that are actually perceived  by the end users and that help them adopt actual behaviours.   Social engineering and human errors in cybersecurity. Build examples and  methods that can effectively provide new insights into the manner in which humans  interact with each other on social media and other online mechanisms, to avoid  common mistakes that lead to system compromise.   Verifiable computing. Using tools described in the previous sections, Europe could  support the development of methods and tools for verifiable computing, ensuring that  end users have the means to verify independently the proper behaviour of ICT  systems, further developing and enhancing trust.  3.6.5. Long-term objectives  Developing user-centric security practices and tools will help weave cybersecurity into our digital  lives in the longer term. This should enable EU citizens to develop trust in digital technologies  for both personal and professional activities. Such practices and tools should become invisible  when everything goes well, and should be visible and explicit when there is a need for  protection. The success of cybersecurity implies long-term sustainable growth of the European  digital society.  Actions should  be taken to  transform  cybersecurity  from a burden to  an asset and a  benefit for end  users.  CYBERSECURITY RESEARCH DIRECTIONS FOR  THE EU’S DIGITAL STRATEGIC AUTONOMY  April 2021  37  3.7.  DIGITAL COMMUNICATION SECURITY  3.7.1. Current and future context of digital communication security  The overall networking environment is moving from ownership-based infrastructure towards on-  demand, pay-per-use networking and computing. Software-defined networking (90) and large-  scale virtualisation (91) are already deployed in data centres and IT services, rapidly penetrating  cyber physical systems and pushing towards large-scale deployment of sensors and actuators  in the IoT. This flexibility, however, blurs the notion of ownership and localisation of  communication systems and platforms as they move across infrastructure at will.  Moving towards virtual communication environments (such as cloud computing infrastructure,  software-defined networks and slicing) is a trend that companies and governments alike are  rapidly adopting. We are currently relying on platforms widely operated outside Europe for  services that are in many respects critical. The fundamental promise of the cloud relies on the  fact that infrastructure is scalable and that communication is available.  The global picture leads us to an environment in which data centres may be hosted outside  Europe and the supporting digital communication infrastructure relies on non-European sourced  technologies.  3.7.2. Problem definition and criticality  Owing to the digitisation of services, all major sectors have an increasing level of dependency  on digital infrastructure. For example, many services are now offered by cloud providers, and  any unavailability, loss of integrity or violation of confidentiality may have serious consequences  for businesses or governments that use their services. The use of multitenant cloud storage also  poses security risks. Moreover, the unavailability of financial operations – because of, for  instance, a denial of service attack – has the potential to affect the operations and economy of  most countries and businesses. Although the new connectivity provides numerous opportunities  to improve the services offered to customers, it also enlarges the attack surface by exposing the  connected industries (Industry 4.0) and critical services (e.g. connected vehicles, smart cities).  Moreover, 5G architecture based on network function virtualisation, network slicing and  software-defined networking will expand the threat landscape by combining traditional IP-based  threats with all-5G network (core, access and edge) threats, insecure legacy 2G/3G/4G  generations and threats introduced by virtualisation technology (92).  This trend in generic on-demand virtual infrastructure is, at present, one of the possible  advantages and drawbacks of cybersecurity. Knowing where a system or service resides is one  of the elements that enables the definition of a perimeter, thus allowing filtering and access  control. Realising which resources are available permits risk evaluation and the selection of  mitigation methods.  Another trend that has an impact on communication is the need for connectivity, which is  exhibited by almost every object that we acquire today. From home assistants to connected  vehicles, from medical devices to smart meters, many industries and services are heavily  (90) Kreutz, D., Ramos, F., Verissimo, P., Rothenberg, C.

A lack of connectivity, for example because of a cyberattack, will  significantly impair the proper function of essential services.  The current state of the art is that Europe is heavily dependent on outside suppliers for both  technology (e.g. communication hardware) and services (e.g. cloud services), whereas other  regions that have heavily invested in the development of virtual communication infrastructure  are also influencing standards (93). This dependency leaves Europe open to difficulties in  sourcing and deploying these new technologies and services to support its continuous  development.  3.7.3. Efforts towards ensuring digital communication security  Europe is already embracing technological advancements in communications, an example  being the 5G infrastructure public–private partnership (PPP) (94). However, in recent years there  has been a marked absence of cybersecurity projects within the 5G umbrella. As a result,  although services have been deployed and demonstrated over 5G technologies, the security  and safety of 5G infrastructure remains an open question. Although 5G infrastructure  technologies are developing rapidly, network operating systems remain behind in terms of  security.  Europe has developed activities under the umbrella of the 5G PPP to address this issue; an  example of this is the 5G-Ensure project (95), which developed security architecture and a  roadmap for security enablers in 5G. Another example is ENISA’s efforts to develop a detailed  threat assessment of 5G infrastructure components (96).  In the context of quantum communications, Europe launched the Open European Quantum Key  Distribution Testbed (OpenQKD) (97) pilot programme. The purpose of the programme is to  create and test experimental quantum communication infrastructure, using quantum key  distribution (98), featuring high-level and quantum-safe security. This programme is expected to  advance the technology involved in quantum communications and reinforce the EU’s strategic  digital capacities.

For this reason, it is important to use  secure channels and trusted communication providers.  CYBERSECURITY RESEARCH DIRECTIONS FOR  THE EU’S DIGITAL STRATEGIC AUTONOMY  April 2021  40  3.7.4. Recommendations  Communication infrastructure is necessary for every service we use. Given this, Europe should  consider the fact that maintaining trust and efficiency in communication services is essential for  the development of a digital Europe. Specific action items include research to develop the  following.   Network services as critical infrastructure. It should be taken into consideration that  cyberattacks on network services have a systemic and potentially very significant effect  on all services, including the operation of all critical ICT infrastructure. Therefore,  network services should be considered a major building block of all critical  infrastructure and secured similarly. Secure network management and operating  systems of network appliances, either virtual or physical, are major building blocks  required to secure the networking infrastructure.   Network security. Develop new methods to detect cyberattacks and mitigate their  effects, and then include them in the design of new service protocols. Such research  will ensure that network security is achieved from the beginning and not retrofitted as  an afterthought. It should also tackle the ability to manage threats over wide-area  networks to mitigate their effects and provide by-design practices and tools to ensure  that carrying out attacks has too high a cost for attackers compared with the gains they  expect.   IoT security. New cybersecurity methods and tools must take into account IoT  constraints, such as energy, storage and bandwidth limitations, to provide  authenticated and resilient communication channels. In relation to this concept, ENISA  has published a report on IoT security (99), listing threats and good practices and  providing recommendations.   Virtual networks. Develop specific cybersecurity methods and tools that can  demonstrably secure virtual environments in which boundaries and borders have  disappeared to such an extent that they cannot be used to define security policies and  assess risk, and that end users may have less knowledge about the system they uses  than the service providers and attackers.  3.7.5. Long-term objective  The long-term objective of digital communication security is to be able to deploy and operate  seamless infrastructure that ensures end-to-end secure communication regardless of whether it  relies on virtual means or physical means. Developing a secure-by-design network operating  system could support Europe’s autonomy in managing its digital communication infrastructure  and could provide a path towards better control and autonomy over this infrastructure.  Security by design for communication infrastructure beyond 5G is also a significant concern.  Even if we do not know what the future of communication infrastructure will be, we need to take  into account cybersecurity aspects as early as possible in the design process for these new  network paradigms. Therefore, Europe should promote investment in creating resilient secure-  by-design solutions for seamless innovative communication infrastructure.

SOCIAL SCIENCE  DIMENSIONS OF STRATEGIC  AUTONOMY  Although digital autonomy and sovereignty rely on technological leadership, and most notably  on significant research and development, technical leadership alone is insufficient to ensure  sustainable strategic autonomy in the long term. The EU must also count on a skilled workforce  and a strong and actionable legal and regulatory framework for research and development.  4.1.  HUMAN CAPACITY BUILDING  Europe must ensure (i) that its businesses and governments have access to a sufficient number  of skilled people who can design, deploy, operate and audit critical infrastructure services, and  (ii) that it retains these skilled people in the context of a global shortage of cybersecurity  professionals.  This next president is going to inherit the most sophisticated and persistent cyber espionage culture  the world has ever seen. He needs to surround himself with experts that can expedite the allocation of  potent layers of next generation defence around our targeted critical infrastructure silos.  ― James Scott, Senior Fellow, Institute for Critical Infrastructure Technology  CYBERSECURITY RESEARCH DIRECTIONS FOR  THE EU’S DIGITAL STRATEGIC AUTONOMY  April 2021  42  4.1.1. Students and cybersecurity  Although the shortage of trained professionals is widely recognised, it should also be made  clear that one (if not the major) reason for this shortage is that there is not a sufficient number of  students entering dedicated educational programmes. Some efforts have been made to  increase the visibility of cybersecurity curricula, including the publication of training needs  related to the deployment of the NIS Directive (100). Other initiatives include the EHR4Cyber (101)  and the Women4Cyber (102) initiatives. However, the level of interest in cybersecurity remains  significantly below the level of interest in other IT fields, such as AI and game development.  Higher salaries elsewhere may well result in professionals or companies moving away from  Europe and this skills shortage consequently increasing.  Europe should thus look at additional ways to enrol students in cybersecurity curricula. Several  alternative approaches could be adopted, including the Industrial Cyber Security Center of  Excellence (103). This encourages IT professionals in companies (car manufacturers, critical  infrastructure operators, etc.) to follow a 1-year training programme on cybersecurity. Upon  return to their companies, the combination of their domain knowledge and cybersecurity skills  enables them to act as ambassadors for cybersecurity in their professional environment.  Another potential action could be to make the job market more visible and understandable to  prospective students.  4.1.2. Skills development  The job market relies heavily on professional certifications. For cybersecurity, most – if not all –  of the widely recognised certifications are based in the United States. Take, for example, the  Global Information Assurance Certification (GIAC) and the Certified Information Systems  Security Professional certification (CISSP), which are widely accepted by many companies and  considered useful by professionals. Unfortunately, although Europe has a wealth of professional  educational companies, these companies rely on frameworks that originate in the United States  to assess skills and deliver certifications. Europe should develop its own cybersecurity skills  framework, with the aim of creating a common skills language for individuals, employers and  training providers. This will help to facilitate skills recognition and support employment and  employability. The framework should allow for further specification and specialisation by  Member States, to accommodate specific needs and requirements, without endangering its  pan-European approach, as that would be counterproductive for the single digital market. The  framework should be complementary to the United Kingdom’s Cyber Security Body of  Knowledge (104), an important step in formalising cybersecurity concepts.  Alternative approaches may also prove useful for specific domains or for acquiring specific skills  without obtaining a formal degree, such as the Rogers Cybersecure Catalyst training  programme (105). Europe should facilitate the establishment of courses that provide a response  to the need for cybersecurity-specialised practitioners and that offer high-level opportunities to  people who are looking for a different career path.

To support trainers, Europe could probably fund a few high-level Erasmus Mundus school  networks or similar programmes targeted at this specific area.  4.1.3. Ethics and cybersecurity  Beyond technology, cybersecurity curricula should include social and legal dimensions,  supporting the view that ethics has a strong link to cybersecurity. As an example, through its  teaching material, the CANVAS project (106) will ensure that the future generation of  cybersecurity experts obtains basic insights into and knowledge of how to tackle ethical and  legal dilemmas in cybersecurity.  4.2.  LEGAL AND REGULATORY FRAMEWORKS  The GDPR and the Cybersecurity Act provide a strong legal basis for the development of  European autonomy. It remains to be seen how these regulations and frameworks will come to  be deployed and to be followed by global businesses.  4.2.1. Tools for evaluating GDPR compliance  Beyond the current legal framework, the EU should reflect on and make freely available to users  tools that enable them to assess independently and transparently the use of their personal  information. The social success of the GDPR among the general public means that the  capability to choose between providing information or giving up on a service should become an  informed decision, and one that can be exerted at any point, independently of any service,  anywhere in the world.  4.2.2. Evaluation of cybersecurity certification schemes  The current European Cybersecurity Act provides a framework for the development of  certification schemes for IT products and services. It is impossible to tell at this stage what  impact this regulation will have and if industry will embrace the development of new certification  schemes that are actually useful to users and that adhere to European values.  In this respect, the new mandate of ENISA on cybersecurity certification (107) is a critical step  that should sustain European digital strategic autonomy, simplifying certification activities for the  industry (thus encouraging certified products in the marketplace) while ensuring that all Member  States can rely on EU-wide capabilities.

A.1.  METHODOLOGY OF THE STUDY  The methodology followed to develop the document is as follows.   We analysed recent relevant cybersecurity research roadmaps (such as the NIS  Working Group 3 strategic research agenda (108); the European cybersecurity strategic  research and innovation agenda for a contractual PPP (109); AEGIS – White Paper on  Research and Innovation in Cybersecurity (110); and SecUnity – Cybersecurity  Research: Challenges and course of action (111)) and other national initiatives.   Through this analysis, 17 research challenges stood out (listed in Section A.2). We  considered that this list of challenges represented the collective opinion of  stakeholders of the EU ecosystem with respect to cybersecurity research.   To find out which of these 17 research challenges were the most important, we created  a survey, which was hosted on a designated web page  (https://ec.europa.eu/eusurvey). The survey was widely disseminated among the  cybersecurity community, with the aim of prioritising the research challenges involved  in the support of EU digital sovereignty and thus autonomy. To ensure that we had a  prioritised list at the end of the survey, the survey respondents were asked to rank the  five most important challenges.   The results of the survey (see Section A.3) led to the selection of the seven most  highly ranked research challenges.   A first document was then drafted that elaborated on the seven challenges.   To receive feedback, the document was circulated and reviewed by experts in the field.   An open validation workshop was organised in Brussels on 30th January 2020, which  led to the final round of comments and finalisation of the document.  A.2. SURVEY OBJECTIVE  The objective of the survey was to obtain from members of the community their opinions on the  importance of each research challenge with respect to the EU’s strategic autonomy. Although  all research challenges may be potentially important, some may be less critical to autonomy  than others.

A.3. ANALYSIS OF THE RESULTS  The survey received 94 responses. Several participants indicated that it was difficult to choose  between the challenges, which forced them to think about those that are most important in the  cybersecurity domain.

Each of the challenges was scored according to  the following formula: the highest-scored challenge received 1 point, the second highest 0.8,  and so on, down to 0.2 for the fifth choice. The remaining challenges were awarded a score of  0. The score for each challenge was then averaged over the 94 responses. The scores for the  seven most highly ranked challenges are provided in Table A.2.

This clearly reflects the importance of data and  the sensitivity of data-driven services.  The next five items were also highly ranked, despite achieving relatively lower scores.  The final item that we retained – digital communication security – attracted less attention than  the others in terms of its ranking position. Despite this, it achieved a significant score (one that  was very close to the score of the challenge that ranked sixth), as many respondents included it  in their list of priorities.  The eighth priority, ‘Authentication, authorisation and identity management’, achieved a score of  0.18 only, so it was considered that this priority was of less interest to the community and less  important to the EU’s digital strategic autonomy.  All 17 priorities were voted for by at least 50 respondents, indicating that all of them were  relevant to the topic.  A.4. RESPONDENT ANALYSIS  Overall, ninety-four respondents completed the survey. The respondents came from a variety of  organisations, as indicated in Figure A.1.

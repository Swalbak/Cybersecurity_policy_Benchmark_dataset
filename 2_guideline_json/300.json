One objective of this Regulation is to enhance the trust of enterprises and consumers in the  internal market and to promote the use of trust services and products. To that end, the  Regulation introduces the notions of qualified trust service (QTS) and qualified trust service  provider (QTSP) with a view to indicating their compliance with the eIDAS high-level security  requirements and obligations. A QTSP is a TSP that has been granted a qualified status and is  supervised by its national supervisory body (SB).  The aforementioned requirements and obligations are specified in:   Article 5 on data processing and protection;   Article 13 on liability;   Article 15 on accessibility for persons with disabilities;   Article 19 on security;   Article 24.2 on requirements for qualified trust services providers; and   Other articles on specific requirements regarding the QTS(s) provided by the QTSP.  This document proposes a security framework to achieve compliance with Article 19 of the  eIDAS Regulation, to which both non-QTSP and QTSP are subject. Nevertheless, Article 19.1  states that the security measures “shall ensure that the level of security is commensurate to the  degree of risk”. Because a security incident can have a different impact on the outputs of a  QTSP than those of a TSP (e.g. loss of legal validity) and the QTSP itself (e.g. loss of qualified  status and related business line), the degree of risk can be different for QTSPs and non-QTSPs.  It is also possible for a non-QTSP to meet the same (or even higher) standards of quality and  trustworthiness as a QTSP. In fact, to achieve compliance with Article 19 (valid for both, QTSPs  and non-QTSPs), this series of documents recommend that the level of security implemented by  non-QTSP, expected to follow ‘best practices’ when operating with due diligence, is equivalent  to the one of QTSP. For this reason, the security practices applied by QTSPs are also relevant  to – and can also be followed by – non-QTSPs.  The background on trust service provisioning and the related security framework, on which  qualified trust service provisioning relies, is presented in the [ENISA Security Framework for  TSPs], to be considered as a pre-requisite to this document.The framework based is on  guidelines for TSPs, taking into account the type of provided trust services, regarding policies,  procedures, and processes in order to achieve compliance with the security requirements  defined in eIDAS under Articles 19.1 and 19.2.  This document completes the latter with recommendations specific to QTSP/QTS, in particular  in order to achieve compliance with the security requirements defined in eIDAS under Article  24.2, and the other articles on specific requirements regarding the QTS(s) provided by the  QTSP.  SECURITY FRAMEWORK FOR QUALIFIED TRUST SERVICE PROVIDERS  March 2021  5  1. INTRODUCTION  1.1 THE ROLE OF ENISA  The European Union Agency for Cybersecurity supports the European Commission and the  Member States on the implementation of the eIDAS by providing security recommendations,  mapping technical and regulatory requirements, promoting the deployment of qualified trust  services, and raising awareness among users on securing their e-transactions. Under the EU  Cybersecurity Act, the Agency gained an extended mandate to explore the area of electronic  identification (eIDs) included in the regulation.  ENISA also supports the national supervisory bodies in implementing their breach reporting by  aggregating their annual summary reports on trust service provider security breaches. The  Agency releases Annual Reports on Trust Services Security Incidents. Moreover, in a means to  support an efficient, effective process of reporting, the Agency has released the Visual Tool -  CIRAS to increase the transparency of cybersecurity incidents. The online tool is accessible to  the public1.  1.2 BACKGROUND ON QUALIFIED TRUST SERVICE PROVISIONING  1.2.1 Definitions of qualified trust services  The eIDAS Regulation ([eIDAS, 2014]) provides a regulatory environment for electronic  identification of natural and legal persons and for trust services in the internal market.  One objective of this Regulation is to enhance the trust of enterprises and consumers in the  internal market and to promote the use of trust services and products. To that end, the  Regulation introduces the notions of QTS and QTSP with a view to indicating their compliance  with the eIDAS high-level security requirements and obligations. A QTSP is a TSP that has  been granted a qualified status by its national SB. The background on trust service provisioning  and the related security framework, on which qualified trust service provisioning relies, is  presented in the [ENISA Security Framework for TSPs], to be considered as a pre-requisite to  this document.  The eIDAS Regulation defines 9 types of QTS:  1. Provision of qualified certificates for electronic signatures;  2. Provision of qualified certificates for electronic seals;  3. Provision of qualified certificates for website authentication;  4. Qualified validation service for qualified electronic signatures (QESig);  5. Qualified validation service for qualified electronic seal (QESeal);  6. Qualified preservation service for qualified electronic signature (QESig);  7. Qualified preservation service for qualified electronic seal (QESeal);  8. Qualified time-stamping service;  9. Qualified electronic registered delivery service.  1 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/incident-reporting/cybersecurity-incident-report-and-analysis-system-visual- analysis/visual-tool  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/incident-reporting/cybersecurity-incident-report-and-analysis-system-visual-analysis/visual-tool https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/incident-reporting/cybersecurity-incident-report-and-analysis-system-visual-analysis/visual-tool  SECURITY FRAMEWORK FOR QUALIFIED TRUST SERVICE PROVIDERS  March 2021  6  1.2.2 Trust Framework  1.2.2.1 Requirements and obligations  Firstly, all QTSPs and the QTSs they provide (hereinafter collectively referred to as  QTSPs/QTSs) are subject to a set of common obligations and requirements, defined in:   Article 5 on data processing and protection;   Article 13 on liability;   Article 15 on accessibility for persons with disabilities;   Article 19 on security; and   Article 24.2 on requirements for qualified trust services providers.  Secondly, there are specific requirements on the QTS(s) provided by the QTSP (Articles 24, 28,  29, 32, 34, 38, 39, 40, 42, 44, and 45).  Each aforementioned article is further covered in [ENISA Recommendations for QTSPs based  on standards].  Both QTSPs and non-QTSPs are subject to Article 5, 13, 15, and 19, however, the eIDAS  Regulation stresses a significant difference between the liability of non-QTSP and QTSP in  Article 13.1: “The intention or negligence of a QTSP shall be presumed unless that QTSP  proves that the damage occurred without the intention or negligence of that QTSP”. Considering  this difference, measures selected by the QTSP may be taken in the light of this burden of  proof. In particular, but not only, the collection of evidence by the QTSP may also be seen as  essential to prove, in case of litigation, that the QTSP acted with due diligence. This topic will be  covered further throughout this document.  Requirements that apply to QTSP/QTS are summed up and illustrated as follows:  Figure 1: QTS/QTS obligations and requirements  1.2.2.2 Compliance supervision  In line with the objective to enhance the trust of enterprises and consumers in the internal  market, eIDAS establishes an ex ante and ex post supervision model to supervise the  compliance of QTSP and the QTS they provide with the eIDAS requirements. This supervision  model takes place:   At initiation, on regular basis, and at any time to ensure high-level security of  QTSs: When a TSP without qualified status intends to start providing QTS or when a  QTSP needs to confirm (as part of a regular assessment or an ad hoc audit) that the  QTS it provides fulfils the eIDAS requirements and obligations, the QTSP is audited by  an eIDAS-accredited conformity assessment body (CAB); The resulting conformity  assessment report is then submitted to the SB which later decides to grant or, if  applicable, to withdraw the qualified status of the TSP and the TS it provides.   At termination to ensure sustainability and durability of QTSs and to boost users’  confidence in the continuity of QTS: SBs should verify the existence and the correct  SECURITY FRAMEWORK FOR QUALIFIED TRUST SERVICE PROVIDERS  March 2021  7  application of provisions on termination plans in cases where QTSPs cease their  activities.  On the other hand, non-QTSPs are subject to a light touch and reactive ex post supervision  model that is justified by the nature of their services and operations. This supervisory regime  does not require audits by CABs. In fact, the national SB has no general obligation to supervise  non-QTSPs and should only take action when it has been informed of a non-compliance with  eIDAS.  These supervision models are the foundation of the trust framework as defined by eIDAS. It is  setting up two distinct complete pyramids of trust; one for the QTSPs and the QTS they provide,  and one for the non-QTSP, which are illustrated below.  Figure 2: eIDAS QTSP pyramid of trust (on left) and non-QTSP pyramid of trust (on right)  On top of the QTSP pyramid of trust are the trusted lists (i.e. files including information related  to the QTSPs, together with information related to the QTSs provided by them) and the EU trust  mark. More information on the trusted lists and the EU trust mark can be found in ENISA series  on initiation2, supervision3, and termination4 of QTS and [ENISA Recommendations for QTSP  based on standards].  2 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/tsp-initiation  3 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/tsp-supervision  4 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/tsp-termination  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/tsp-initiation https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/tsp-supervision https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/tsp-termination  SECURITY FRAMEWORK FOR QUALIFIED TRUST SERVICE PROVIDERS  March 2021  8  1.2.3 Security Framework  Both non-QTSPs and QTSPs are subject to Article 19 on security requirements (more general  information about Article 19 and security framework can be found in Section 1.2.3 of [ENISA  Security Framework for TSPs]). Nevertheless, Article 19.1 states that the security measures  “shall ensure that the level of security is commensurate to the degree of risk”. As further  covered in Section 2, because a security incident often has a more significant impact on the  outputs of a QTSP than those of a TSP (e.g. loss of legal validity), the degree of risk can be  seen as higher than for a TSP and it therefore requires a higher level of security. Qualified  services are usually used to handle more sensitive information, or in more secure environments,  therefore the breach of security can have a stronger impact. It is however perfectly possible for  a non-QTSP to meet the same (or even higher) standards of quality and trustworthiness as a  QTSP.  To ensure that the minimum level of security is implemented by the QTSP, Article 24  “Requirements for qualified trust service providers” defines requirements to ensure that some  specific security aspects are properly addressed by the QTSP. Related to this, besides Article  24, eIDAS also defines additional requirements for QTSP depending on the QTS(s) they  provide, through Articles 28, 29, 32, 34, 38, 39, 40, 42, 44, and 45.  In Section 1.2.3 of [ENISA Security Framework for TSPs], the security framework for non-QTSP  is illustrated as follows:  Figure 3: Security Framework for TSPs  SECURITY FRAMEWORK FOR QUALIFIED TRUST SERVICE PROVIDERS  March 2021  9  Related to what is stated in this section, the security framework for QTSPs can be illustrated as  follows:  Figure 4: Security framework for QTSPs  1.3 TARGET AUDIENCE  The audience of this document is TSPs, prospective QTSPs, and QTSPs looking for guidelines  for fulfilling requirements originating from the eIDAS Regulation.  In particular, TSPs aiming to become qualified might be interested in identifying, based on this  document, the additional security requirements to those proposed for non-QTSPs in order to be  granted the qualified status.  1.4 PURPOSE AND STRUCTURE OF THIS DOCUMENT  This document is to be used in addition to the security framework common to all TSPs, proposed  in [ENISA Security Framework for TSPs], that proposes a security framework based on guidelines  for TSPs, taking into account the type of provided trust services, regarding policies, procedures,  and processes in order to achieve compliance with the security requirements defined in eIDAS  under Articles 19.1 and 19.2.  This document completes the latter with elements peculiar to QTSP/QTS, particularly in order to  achieve compliance with the security requirements defined in eIDAS under Article 24, and,  depending on the qualified trust service, Articles 28, 29, 32, 34, 38, 39, 40, 42, 44, and 45.  The structure of this document is consistent with the latter. In particular:  SECURITY FRAMEWORK FOR QUALIFIED TRUST SERVICE PROVIDERS  March 2021  10   Section 2 “Risk management” provides recommendations that are specific to QTSPs  when performing the risk management proposed in [ENISA Security Framework for  TSPs].   Section 3 “Security incident management” provides recommendations that are specific  to QTSPs when managing security incidents as proposed in [ENISA Security  Framework for TSPs].   Section 4 “Trust services security measures” proposes a list of references to help to  mitigate the risks identified in Section 2 and monitoring security events that might be  relevant for notification and remediation as identified in Section 3. The proposed  references come from “technical” standards and best practices to address the risks  both in general (Section 4.1) and in relevance to the specific trust services provided  (Section 4.2).  Figure 5: Structure of the document  This document refers to ETSI and ISO/IEC standards (see disclaimer below). The ETSI  standards in particular, tailor generic risk management to eIDAS trust services and provide  requirements that answer directly to eIDAS requirements (i.e. not necessarily linked to the  security framework). These standards are consequently and logically also referred in [ENISA  Recommendations for QTSPs based on standards] as benchmarks to achieve compliance with  eIDAS, including the related security obligations. [ENISA Recommendations for QTSP based on  standards] will provide key references to this document.  1.5 DISCLAIMER  Due to the technological neutrality of the eIDAS requirements, it is worth noting that:  SECURITY FRAMEWORK FOR QUALIFIED TRUST SERVICE PROVIDERS  March 2021  11   Different approaches based on different technologies than the ones exposed in this  document can lead to eIDAS compliance;   Compliance against the standards (or other standards) is not mandatory to achieve  compliance against eIDAS requirements;   Compliance against these standards does not automatically imply conformance to  eIDAS requirements. Although these standards may be seen as best practices, there is  no automatic presumption of compliance5  to eIDAS after following the said standards.  5 Some nationally-defined schemes (e.g. in Czech Republic, France, Netherlands, Slovakia) specify conformity criteria based  on the ETSI standards, along with a limited set of additional requirements, that provide presumption of compliance to the  eIDAS requirements.  SECURITY FRAMEWORK FOR QUALIFIED TRUST SERVICE PROVIDERS  March 2021  12  2. RISK MANAGEMENT  As mentioned in Section 1.1.3, the eIDAS Regulation requires that TSP shall take appropriate  technical and organisational measures to manage the risks posed to the security of the trust  services they provide and to minimize the impact of security incidents. Having regard to the  latest technological developments, those measures shall ensure that the level of security is  commensurate to the degree of risk.  Many standards already provide guidelines for risk management. One of them is [ISO/IEC  27005]. It provides guidelines for information security risk management in an organization,  supporting the requirements of information security management (ISMS) according to [ISO/IEC  27001]. However, this standard does not provide any specific method for information security  risk management.  Based on [ISO/IEC 27005] general approach, [ENISA Security Framework for TSPs] aims at  presenting more specific and practical guidelines for TSPs regarding the management of risks  posed to the security of their trust services.  The guidelines for QTSPs are proposed to be similar to those for TSPs. The QTSPs are  suggested to consult [ENISA Security Framework for TSPs] for a method to manage the risks  posed to the security of its qualified trust services.  2.1 RECOMMENDATIONS FOR QTSPS  Besides the guidelines proposed in [ENISA Security Framework for TSPs], this document  recommends the following.  2.1.1 Level of security required by the qualified status  The eIDAS Regulation introduced the notions of qualified trust service (QTS) and qualified trust  service provider (QTSP) with a view to indicating requirements and obligations that ensure  high-level security and a higher presumption of their legal effect. Because of this higher  presumption of legal effects (e.g. Qualified Electronic Signature, QES, has the equivalent legal  effect to handwritten signature), the consequences of a security incident can have a higher  impact on a QTSP than those of a non-QTSP, in particular for customers of the QTSP: e.g.  previously issued QES may a posteriori lose their qualified status, issued certificates cannot be  used for QES anymore, previous validations of QES may be questioned, QES may be wrongly  preserved because badly secured. Besides the impact on customers, the withdrawal of the  qualified status of a QTSP may have dramatic consequences on the viability of the QTSP; the  consequence of a security incident may cause the withdrawal of its qualified status and so the  loss of its business line and customers (e.g. customers which need qualified certificates). This  must be considered by the QTSP when estimating the level of impact of security incident on an  asset (see Section 2.2.1.5 “Identification of consequences” and Section 2.2.2.2 “Estimation of  the level of impacts” of [ENISA Security Framework for TSPs]).  Following the formula provided in Section 2.2.2.3 of [ENISA Security Framework for TSPs]:  𝑹𝒊𝒔𝒌 = 𝑻𝒉𝒓𝒆𝒂𝒕 × 𝑽𝒖𝒍𝒏𝒆𝒓𝒂𝒃𝒊𝒍𝒊𝒕𝒚 × 𝑰𝒎𝒑𝒂𝒄𝒕  As the Impact increases, the degree of risk also increases and so the level of security required  for QTSP may be higher than one for non-QTSP.  SECURITY FRAMEWORK FOR QUALIFIED TRUST SERVICE PROVIDERS  March 2021  13  Related to this, the QTSP must also formulate appropriate risk acceptance criteria, used to  evaluate the significance of a risk and to determine whether the risk is acceptable or tolerable,  which ensure that the level of security is commensurate to the degree of risk. The risk  acceptance criteria will influence the risk treatment measures.  2.1.2 Presumption of negligence  Formulating an appropriate risk acceptance criteria and implementing the adequate controls is  particularly important regarding the liability of the QTSP. The eIDAS Regulation states in Article  13: “The intention or negligence of a QTSP shall be presumed unless that QTSP proves that the  damage […] occurred without the intention or negligence of that QTSP.” This means that, in  order to prove that the QTSP operated without intention or negligence, it is essential that the  QTSP is able to demonstrate that it operated with due diligence. It is therefore highly  recommended when implementing the adequate controls to attach importance to collection of  the records, audit, and monitoring of these controls. This topic, that is certainly a best practice  for TSP, can be seen as a self-protective measure for a QTSP. Particular attention must also be  paid to the protection of such records and therefore their associated level of impact if they are  compromised.  2.1.3 Conformity assessments  Although this is a valid point for TSPs, it takes an additional importance for QTSPs to undergo a  conformity assessment (also called “audit”), since most, if not all, audit schemes require the  TSP to perform a risk assessment and to produce the related mitigation plan.  2.1.4 Measures against forgery and theft of data  The eIDAS Regulation states in Article 24.2(g) that the QTSP shall “take appropriate measures  against forgery and theft of data”. It thereby emphasizes the fact that, among the technical and  organisational measures to manage the risks posed to the security of its trust services, the  QTSP shall particularly pay attention to the forgery and theft of data. This should be considered  when identifying threats (see Section 2.2.1.2 “Identification of threats” of [ENISA Security  Framework for TSPs]).  SECURITY FRAMEWORK FOR QUALIFIED TRUST SERVICE PROVIDERS  March 2021  14  3. SECURITY INCIDENT  MANAGEMENT  [ENISA Security Framework for TSPs] already presents guidelines supporting TSP in fulfilling  the part of Article 19.1 and Article 19 by using the appropriate measures to efficiently detect,  measure, respond, report, and recover from security incidents.  The guidelines for QTSP are proposed to be identical for TSP. The QTSP is then suggested to  consult this document for more information about the appropriated measures related to security  incident management.  3.1 RECOMMENDATIONS FOR QTS  Besides the guidelines proposed in [ENISA Security Framework for TSPs], this document  recommends the following.  3.1.1 Termination plan  [ENISA Security Framework for TSPs] recommends in Section 3.4 “Recover from the incident”  to be prepared before an incident occurs with a termination plan. Such a termination plan is  mandatory for QTSP following Article 24.2(i) of eIDAS. A termination plan is a key document  regarding a QTSP/QTS. As stated in Recital (41), Article 17(4) and Article 24.2(i) of eIDAS, this  document shall be verified by the SB because of its particular importance regarding the  sustainability and durability of QTSs and to boost users’ confidence in the continuity of qualified  trust services, such as in exceptional/unfortunate cases of QTSP unscheduled termination (e.g.  bankruptcy). Detailed information on the termination plan can be found in the related section of  [ENISA Recommendations for QTSPs based on standards].  SECURITY FRAMEWORK FOR QUALIFIED TRUST SERVICE PROVIDERS  March 2021  15  4. QUALIFIED TRUST SERVICES  SECURITY MEASURES  Section 4 of [ENISA Security Framework for TSPs], called “Trust services security measures”,  proposes a list of security measures to help mitigating the risks identified in Section 2 and  monitoring security events that might be relevant for notification and remediation as identified in  Section 3. The proposed measures come from technical standards and best practices to  address common for all and with relevance with specific trust services offered.  This section proposes a list of references above those proposed in [ENISA Security Framework  for TSPs] that are targeted to QTSP/QTS.  It may be observed that the additional security measures to be implemented by QTSP/QTS are  limited. As a matter of fact, when a TSP operates with due diligence, its security measures are  similar to the security measures required to QTSP. The few additional security measures are  further detailed in the below sections.  NOTE1: As mentioned in Section 1.4, to provide QTSP with further guidance and illustration on  these policies, procedures, and processes, this document refers to ETSI and ISO/IEC  standards. These standards are not made mandatory by the eIDAS Regulation. Regarding the  ETSI standards, it is worth noting that they tailor generic risk management to eIDAS trust  services and as such, the security measures they contain may be regarded as the benchmark /  common answer to the risks that are typically identified when operating the corresponding QTS  and their components. In that respect, the categories of security measures identified in the  subsections below may be seen as “typical topics of concern” when operating a QTSP offering  a specific type of QTS.  NOTE2: This section aims at introducing a list of security measures in the context of eIDAS  Article 19 security framework, as well as pertinent security measures derived from eIDAS  articles specific to QTSP/QTS. This section does not intend to provide guidelines to achieve full  compliance of a QTSP/QTS with the requirements of eIDAS. For such guidelines, the reader  may be interested in [ENISA Recommendations for QTSPs based on standards].  4.1 SECURITY MEASURES FOR ALL QTSPS  As previously mentioned, security measures for QTSPs and non-QTSP don’t deviate much. In  fact, as part of this series of documents, the security measures proposed to QTSP/QTS are the  same as the security measures for all TSPs proposed in [ENISA Security Framework for TSPs].  These security measures are based on [EN 319 401] and are further introduced in [ENISA  Security Framework for TSPs].  However, one must note that some of the presented security measures are made mandatory for  QTSPs in the eIDAS Regulation. These mandatory requirements for all QTSPs are laid down in  Article 24.2. All of them are mapped below with their [EN 319 401] requirements (this mapping  originates from Annex A of [EN 319 411-2]):  SECURITY FRAMEWORK FOR QUALIFIED TRUST SERVICE PROVIDERS  March 2021  16  Article 24.2 states that a QTSP providing QTSs shall:  a) inform the supervisory body of any change in the provision of its  qualified trust services and an intention to cease those activities;  -  b) employ staff and, if applicable, subcontractors who possess the  necessary expertise, reliability, experience, and qualifications and  who have received appropriate training regarding security and  personal data protection rules and shall apply administrative and  management procedures which correspond to European or  international standards;  Clause 7.2  c) with regard to the risk of liability for damages in accordance with  Article 13, maintain sufficient financial resources and/or obtain  appropriate liability insurance, in accordance with national law;  REQ-7.1.1-04  d) before entering into a contractual relationship, inform, in a clear and  comprehensive manner, any person seeking to use a qualified trust  service of the precise terms and conditions regarding the use of that  service, including any limitations on its use;  Clause 6.2  e) use trustworthy systems and products that are protected against  modification and ensure the technical security and reliability of the  processes supported by them; Clause 7.5  Clause 7.6  REQ-7.4-02  REQ-7.4-03  REQ-7.4-10  Clause 7.7  Clause 7.8  f) use trustworthy systems to store data provided to it, in a verifiable  form so that:  (i) they are publicly available for retrieval only where the  consent of the person to whom the data relates has been  obtained,  (ii) only authorised persons can make entries and changes to  the stored data,  (iii) the data can be checked for authenticity;  g) take appropriate measures against forgery and theft of data6; Clause 7.2 to  Clause 7.12  h) record and keep accessible for an appropriate period of time,  including after the activities of the qualified trust service provider  have ceased, all relevant information concerning data issued and  received by the qualified trust service provider, in particular, for the  purpose of providing evidence in legal proceedings and for the  purpose of ensuring continuity of the service. Such recording may  be done electronically;  Clause 7.12  REQ-7.7-07  i) have an up-to-date termination plan to ensure continuity of service  in accordance with provisions verified by the supervisory body under  point (i) of Article 17(4);  Clause 7.12  j) ensure lawful processing of personal data in accordance with  Directive 95/46/EC;  REQ-7.13-05  Each of the points enumerated in this article are specifically covered in [ENISA  Recommendations for QTSPs based on standards].  6 This clause is discussed in Section 2.1.  SECURITY FRAMEWORK FOR QUALIFIED TRUST SERVICE PROVIDERS  March 2021  17  An important note for all QTSPs concerns their liability pursuant to Article 13 of eIDAS: “The  intention or negligence of a QTSP shall be presumed unless that QTSP proves that the damage  […] occurred without the intention or negligence of that QTSP.” This means that in order to  prove that the QTSP operated without intention or negligence, it is essential that the QTSP is  able to demonstrate it operated with due diligence. It is therefore highly recommended to QTSP  to attach a high importance to the collection and protection of the records and audits.  Regarding the collection and protection of the records and audits, it should be noted that  pursuant to Article 24.2(h) of eIDAS, it is required that they shall be made accessible for an  appropriate period of time, including after the activities of the qualified trust service provider  have ceased.  4.2 SECURITY MEASURES FOR PROVISION OF SPECIFIC QTS  4.2.1 Provision of qualified certificates  On top of the security measures for certification services provided in [ENISA Security  Framework for TSPs], this section covers additional measures applicable to the provision of  qualified certificates.  As mentioned in [ENISA Security Framework for TSPs], security requirements for the issuance  of certificates are specified in ETSI EN 319 411 parts 1 and 2 “Policy requirements for TSP  issuing certificates”. In particular, [EN 319 411-2] provides specific requirements for QTSP  issuing qualified certificates. Additional requirements related to the security framework are laid  down in:   Clause 6.5.1 on “Key Pair Generation and Installation” (complements [EN 319 411-1]  clause 6.5.1). The listed requirements concern the generation and installation of key  pairs related to qualified certificates, where the private key resides on a QSCD.  QTSP issuing qualified website authentication certificates looking for their recognition by  browsers may also be interested in [TSP Technical Best Practices], developed by  representatives of Apple, Google, Microsoft, and Mozilla.  4.2.2 Qualified validation service for QESig/QESeal  Security and policy requirements for this service are specified in [TS 119 441] “Policy  requirements for TSP providing signature validation services”.  Additional requirements for QTSP providing qualified validation service are proposed in Annex  B of this standard. Nevertheless, this Annex does not comprise any additional technical and  organisational measures to manage the risks posed to the security of the provision of this trust  service. Instead, it provides requirements to comply with Article 33 of eIDAS. This is covered  further in [ENISA Recommendations for QTSPs based on standards].  Therefore, security measures described in [ENISA Security Framework for TSPs] for signature  validation service also apply for QTSP providing qualified validation service for qualified  signatures and/or qualified seals.  4.2.3 Qualified preservation service for QESig/QESeal  Security and policy requirements for this service are specified in [TS 119 511] “Policy and  security requirements for trust service providers providing long-term preservation of digital  signatures or general data using digital signature techniques”.  Additional requirements for QTSP providing a qualified preservation service are proposed in  Annex A of this standard. Nevertheless, this Annex does not comprise any additional technical  SECURITY FRAMEWORK FOR QUALIFIED TRUST SERVICE PROVIDERS  March 2021  18  and organisational measures to manage the risks posed to the security of the provision of this  trust service. Instead, it provides requirements to comply with Article 34 of eIDAS. This is  covered further in [ENISA Recommendations for QTSPs based on standards].  Therefore, security measures described in [ENISA Security Framework for TSPs] for  preservation service also apply for QTSP providing qualified preservation services.  4.2.4 Qualified time-stamping service  Security and policy requirements for this service are specified in [EN 319 421] “Policy and  Security Requirements for Trust Service Providers issuing Time-Stamps”.  Additional requirements for QTSP providing qualified time-stamps are proposed in clause 8 of  this standard. In a nutshell, it states that:   The time-stamping unit (TSU) signature verification (public) key certificate is  recommended to be issued by a certification authority operating under [EN 319 411-2]  certificate policy;   The TSU issuing qualified time-stamps shall not issue non-qualified electronic time-  stamps. As stated in [EN 319 411-2] clause 8.1 note 2, “the relying party is expected to  use a Trusted List to establish whether the time-stamp unit and the timestamp are  qualified. If the public key of the TSU is listed in the Trusted List and the service it  represents is a qualified time-stamping service, then the time-stamps issued by this  TSU can be considered as qualified.”  4.2.5 Qualified electronic registered delivery service  Security and policy requirements for this service are specified in [EN 319 521] “Policy and  security requirements for Electronic Registered Delivery Service (ERDS) Providers” and [EN  319 531] “Policy and security requirements for Registered Electronic Mail Service (REMS)  Providers”.  These standards explicitly indicate which requirements apply to the qualified services thanks to  specific sections called “Provisions for EU QREMS/QERDS”. The content of these sections is  covered in this section; The section that applies to non-qualified electronic registered delivery  services (non-QERDS) and non-qualified registered electronic mail services (non-QREMS), are  further covered in [ENISA Security Framework for TSPs].  Regarding the management and operation of EU QREMS and QERDS, the only additional  proposed security measure targets human resources (clause 7.2.2 of [EN 319 521]) and in  particular, the necessity of an identity verification officer.  Regarding general provision on QERDS and on QREMS, clauses 5 of both standards provide  ad-hoc requirements on the QTSP. Specifically, the delta for qualified services are included in  the sections “Provisions for EU QREMS/QERDS” of the following clauses:   Clause 5.1 User content integrity and confidentiality;   Clause 5.2 Users Identification and Authentication;   Clause 5.3 Time reference;   Clause 5.4 Events and evidence;   Clause 5.5 Interoperability.  4.2.6 Remote QSCD services  The Regulation states through Recital (51) that it should be possible for the signatory (resp.  creator of the seal) to entrust QSCDs to the care of a third party, provided that appropriate  mechanisms and procedures are implemented to ensure that the signatory (resp. creator of the  SECURITY FRAMEWORK FOR QUALIFIED TRUST SERVICE PROVIDERS  March 2021  19  seal) has sole control (resp. control) over the use of his electronic signature/seal creation data,  and the qualified electronic signature/seal requirements are met by the use of the device.  As stated in eIDAS Recital (52), in order to ensure that such electronic signatures[/seals]  receive the same legal recognition as electronic signature[/seals] created in an entirely user-  managed environment, remote electronic signature service providers should:  1) apply specific management and administrative security procedures; and  2) use trustworthy systems and products.  Following 1), eIDAS requires that remote QSCDs may only be provided by QTSPs, even if this  type of service is not a qualified trust service per se. The security measures proposed in Section  4.1 for all QTSPs therefore also apply to QTSP providing remote QSCD services. Additionally,  on top of [EN 319 401], ETSI released [TS 119 431-1] proposing “Policy and security  requirements for trust service providers; Part 1: TSP service components operating a remote  QSCD / SCDev”.  Following 2), to ensure their trustworthiness, systems and products must implement appropriate  technical measures to manage the risks posed to their security. Annex II of eIDAS made some  of these security measures mandatory and also made, pursuant to Article 30(1) and 39(2) of  eIDAS, the certification against these security measures mandatory. The security framework of  such systems and products are provided in CEN [EN 419 241-2].  More information on the standards that can be used to comply with eIDAS requirements, and  relevant security measures, can be found in the related section of [ENISA Recommendations for  QTSPs based on standards].

One objective of this Regulation is to enhance the trust of enterprises and consumers in the  internal market and to promote the use of trust services and products. To that end, the  Regulation introduces the notions of qualified trust service (QTS) and qualified trust service  provider (QTSP) with a view to indicating their compliance with the eIDAS high-level security  requirements and obligations. A QTSP is a TSP that has been granted a qualified status and is  supervised by its national supervisory body (SB).  The aforementioned requirements and obligations are specified in:   Article 5 on data processing and protection;   Article 13 on liability;   Article 15 on accessibility for persons with disabilities;   Article 19 on security;   Article 24.2 on requirements for qualified trust services providers; and   Other articles on specific requirements regarding the QTS(s) provided by the QTSP.  This document proposes a security framework to achieve compliance with Article 19 of the  eIDAS Regulation, to which both non-QTSP and QTSP are subject. Nevertheless, Article 19.1  states that the security measures “shall ensure that the level of security is commensurate to the  degree of risk”. Because a security incident can have a different impact on the outputs of a  QTSP than those of a TSP (e.g. loss of legal validity) and the QTSP itself (e.g. loss of qualified  status and related business line), the degree of risk can be different for QTSPs and non-QTSPs.  It is also possible for a non-QTSP to meet the same (or even higher) standards of quality and  trustworthiness as a QTSP. In fact, to achieve compliance with Article 19 (valid for both, QTSPs  and non-QTSPs), this series of documents recommend that the level of security implemented by  non-QTSP, expected to follow ‘best practices’ when operating with due diligence, is equivalent  to the one of QTSP. For this reason, the security practices applied by QTSPs are also relevant  to – and can also be followed by – non-QTSPs.  The background on trust service provisioning and the related security framework, on which  qualified trust service provisioning relies, is presented in the [ENISA Security Framework for  TSPs], to be considered as a pre-requisite to this document.The framework based is on  guidelines for TSPs, taking into account the type of provided trust services, regarding policies,  procedures, and processes in order to achieve compliance with the security requirements  defined in eIDAS under Articles 19.1 and 19.2.  This document completes the latter with recommendations specific to QTSP/QTS, in particular  in order to achieve compliance with the security requirements defined in eIDAS under Article  24.2, and the other articles on specific requirements regarding the QTS(s) provided by the  QTSP.  SECURITY FRAMEWORK FOR QUALIFIED TRUST SERVICE PROVIDERS  March 2021  5  1. INTRODUCTION  1.1 THE ROLE OF ENISA  The European Union Agency for Cybersecurity supports the European Commission and the  Member States on the implementation of the eIDAS by providing security recommendations,  mapping technical and regulatory requirements, promoting the deployment of qualified trust  services, and raising awareness among users on securing their e-transactions. Under the EU  Cybersecurity Act, the Agency gained an extended mandate to explore the area of electronic  identification (eIDs) included in the regulation.  ENISA also supports the national supervisory bodies in implementing their breach reporting by  aggregating their annual summary reports on trust service provider security breaches. The  Agency releases Annual Reports on Trust Services Security Incidents. Moreover, in a means to  support an efficient, effective process of reporting, the Agency has released the Visual Tool -  CIRAS to increase the transparency of cybersecurity incidents. The online tool is accessible to  the public1.  1.2 BACKGROUND ON QUALIFIED TRUST SERVICE PROVISIONING  1.2.1 Definitions of qualified trust services  The eIDAS Regulation ([eIDAS, 2014]) provides a regulatory environment for electronic  identification of natural and legal persons and for trust services in the internal market.  One objective of this Regulation is to enhance the trust of enterprises and consumers in the  internal market and to promote the use of trust services and products. To that end, the  Regulation introduces the notions of QTS and QTSP with a view to indicating their compliance  with the eIDAS high-level security requirements and obligations. A QTSP is a TSP that has  been granted a qualified status by its national SB. The background on trust service provisioning  and the related security framework, on which qualified trust service provisioning relies, is  presented in the [ENISA Security Framework for TSPs], to be considered as a pre-requisite to  this document.  The eIDAS Regulation defines 9 types of QTS:  1. Provision of qualified certificates for electronic signatures;  2. Provision of qualified certificates for electronic seals;  3. Provision of qualified certificates for website authentication;  4. Qualified validation service for qualified electronic signatures (QESig);  5. Qualified validation service for qualified electronic seal (QESeal);  6. Qualified preservation service for qualified electronic signature (QESig);  7. Qualified preservation service for qualified electronic seal (QESeal);  8. Qualified time-stamping service;  9. Qualified electronic registered delivery service.  1 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/incident-reporting/cybersecurity-incident-report-and-analysis-system-visual- analysis/visual-tool  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/incident-reporting/cybersecurity-incident-report-and-analysis-system-visual-analysis/visual-tool https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/incident-reporting/cybersecurity-incident-report-and-analysis-system-visual-analysis/visual-tool  SECURITY FRAMEWORK FOR QUALIFIED TRUST SERVICE PROVIDERS  March 2021  6  1.2.2 Trust Framework  1.2.2.1 Requirements and obligations  Firstly, all QTSPs and the QTSs they provide (hereinafter collectively referred to as  QTSPs/QTSs) are subject to a set of common obligations and requirements, defined in:   Article 5 on data processing and protection;   Article 13 on liability;   Article 15 on accessibility for persons with disabilities;   Article 19 on security; and   Article 24.2 on requirements for qualified trust services providers.  Secondly, there are specific requirements on the QTS(s) provided by the QTSP (Articles 24, 28,  29, 32, 34, 38, 39, 40, 42, 44, and 45).  Each aforementioned article is further covered in [ENISA Recommendations for QTSPs based  on standards].  Both QTSPs and non-QTSPs are subject to Article 5, 13, 15, and 19, however, the eIDAS  Regulation stresses a significant difference between the liability of non-QTSP and QTSP in  Article 13.1: “The intention or negligence of a QTSP shall be presumed unless that QTSP  proves that the damage occurred without the intention or negligence of that QTSP”. Considering  this difference, measures selected by the QTSP may be taken in the light of this burden of  proof. In particular, but not only, the collection of evidence by the QTSP may also be seen as  essential to prove, in case of litigation, that the QTSP acted with due diligence. This topic will be  covered further throughout this document.  Requirements that apply to QTSP/QTS are summed up and illustrated as follows:  Figure 1: QTS/QTS obligations and requirements  1.2.2.2 Compliance supervision  In line with the objective to enhance the trust of enterprises and consumers in the internal  market, eIDAS establishes an ex ante and ex post supervision model to supervise the  compliance of QTSP and the QTS they provide with the eIDAS requirements. This supervision  model takes place:   At initiation, on regular basis, and at any time to ensure high-level security of  QTSs: When a TSP without qualified status intends to start providing QTS or when a  QTSP needs to confirm (as part of a regular assessment or an ad hoc audit) that the  QTS it provides fulfils the eIDAS requirements and obligations, the QTSP is audited by  an eIDAS-accredited conformity assessment body (CAB); The resulting conformity  assessment report is then submitted to the SB which later decides to grant or, if  applicable, to withdraw the qualified status of the TSP and the TS it provides.   At termination to ensure sustainability and durability of QTSs and to boost users’  confidence in the continuity of QTS: SBs should verify the existence and the correct  SECURITY FRAMEWORK FOR QUALIFIED TRUST SERVICE PROVIDERS  March 2021  7  application of provisions on termination plans in cases where QTSPs cease their  activities.  On the other hand, non-QTSPs are subject to a light touch and reactive ex post supervision  model that is justified by the nature of their services and operations. This supervisory regime  does not require audits by CABs. In fact, the national SB has no general obligation to supervise  non-QTSPs and should only take action when it has been informed of a non-compliance with  eIDAS.  These supervision models are the foundation of the trust framework as defined by eIDAS. It is  setting up two distinct complete pyramids of trust; one for the QTSPs and the QTS they provide,  and one for the non-QTSP, which are illustrated below.  Figure 2: eIDAS QTSP pyramid of trust (on left) and non-QTSP pyramid of trust (on right)  On top of the QTSP pyramid of trust are the trusted lists (i.e. files including information related  to the QTSPs, together with information related to the QTSs provided by them) and the EU trust  mark. More information on the trusted lists and the EU trust mark can be found in ENISA series  on initiation2, supervision3, and termination4 of QTS and [ENISA Recommendations for QTSP  based on standards].  2 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/tsp-initiation  3 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/tsp-supervision  4 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/tsp-termination  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/tsp-initiation https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/tsp-supervision https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/tsp-termination  SECURITY FRAMEWORK FOR QUALIFIED TRUST SERVICE PROVIDERS  March 2021  8  1.2.3 Security Framework  Both non-QTSPs and QTSPs are subject to Article 19 on security requirements (more general  information about Article 19 and security framework can be found in Section 1.2.3 of [ENISA  Security Framework for TSPs]). Nevertheless, Article 19.1 states that the security measures  “shall ensure that the level of security is commensurate to the degree of risk”. As further  covered in Section 2, because a security incident often has a more significant impact on the  outputs of a QTSP than those of a TSP (e.g. loss of legal validity), the degree of risk can be  seen as higher than for a TSP and it therefore requires a higher level of security. Qualified  services are usually used to handle more sensitive information, or in more secure environments,  therefore the breach of security can have a stronger impact. It is however perfectly possible for  a non-QTSP to meet the same (or even higher) standards of quality and trustworthiness as a  QTSP.  To ensure that the minimum level of security is implemented by the QTSP, Article 24  “Requirements for qualified trust service providers” defines requirements to ensure that some  specific security aspects are properly addressed by the QTSP. Related to this, besides Article  24, eIDAS also defines additional requirements for QTSP depending on the QTS(s) they  provide, through Articles 28, 29, 32, 34, 38, 39, 40, 42, 44, and 45.  In Section 1.2.3 of [ENISA Security Framework for TSPs], the security framework for non-QTSP  is illustrated as follows:  Figure 3: Security Framework for TSPs  SECURITY FRAMEWORK FOR QUALIFIED TRUST SERVICE PROVIDERS  March 2021  9  Related to what is stated in this section, the security framework for QTSPs can be illustrated as  follows:  Figure 4: Security framework for QTSPs  1.3 TARGET AUDIENCE  The audience of this document is TSPs, prospective QTSPs, and QTSPs looking for guidelines  for fulfilling requirements originating from the eIDAS Regulation.  In particular, TSPs aiming to become qualified might be interested in identifying, based on this  document, the additional security requirements to those proposed for non-QTSPs in order to be  granted the qualified status.  1.4 PURPOSE AND STRUCTURE OF THIS DOCUMENT  This document is to be used in addition to the security framework common to all TSPs, proposed  in [ENISA Security Framework for TSPs], that proposes a security framework based on guidelines  for TSPs, taking into account the type of provided trust services, regarding policies, procedures,  and processes in order to achieve compliance with the security requirements defined in eIDAS  under Articles 19.1 and 19.2.  This document completes the latter with elements peculiar to QTSP/QTS, particularly in order to  achieve compliance with the security requirements defined in eIDAS under Article 24, and,  depending on the qualified trust service, Articles 28, 29, 32, 34, 38, 39, 40, 42, 44, and 45.  The structure of this document is consistent with the latter. In particular:  SECURITY FRAMEWORK FOR QUALIFIED TRUST SERVICE PROVIDERS  March 2021  10   Section 2 “Risk management” provides recommendations that are specific to QTSPs  when performing the risk management proposed in [ENISA Security Framework for  TSPs].   Section 3 “Security incident management” provides recommendations that are specific  to QTSPs when managing security incidents as proposed in [ENISA Security  Framework for TSPs].   Section 4 “Trust services security measures” proposes a list of references to help to  mitigate the risks identified in Section 2 and monitoring security events that might be  relevant for notification and remediation as identified in Section 3. The proposed  references come from “technical” standards and best practices to address the risks  both in general (Section 4.1) and in relevance to the specific trust services provided  (Section 4.2).  Figure 5: Structure of the document  This document refers to ETSI and ISO/IEC standards (see disclaimer below). The ETSI  standards in particular, tailor generic risk management to eIDAS trust services and provide  requirements that answer directly to eIDAS requirements (i.e. not necessarily linked to the  security framework). These standards are consequently and logically also referred in [ENISA  Recommendations for QTSPs based on standards] as benchmarks to achieve compliance with  eIDAS, including the related security obligations. [ENISA Recommendations for QTSP based on  standards] will provide key references to this document.  1.5 DISCLAIMER  Due to the technological neutrality of the eIDAS requirements, it is worth noting that:  SECURITY FRAMEWORK FOR QUALIFIED TRUST SERVICE PROVIDERS  March 2021  11   Different approaches based on different technologies than the ones exposed in this  document can lead to eIDAS compliance;   Compliance against the standards (or other standards) is not mandatory to achieve  compliance against eIDAS requirements;   Compliance against these standards does not automatically imply conformance to  eIDAS requirements. Although these standards may be seen as best practices, there is  no automatic presumption of compliance5  to eIDAS after following the said standards.  5 Some nationally-defined schemes (e.g. in Czech Republic, France, Netherlands, Slovakia) specify conformity criteria based  on the ETSI standards, along with a limited set of additional requirements, that provide presumption of compliance to the  eIDAS requirements.  SECURITY FRAMEWORK FOR QUALIFIED TRUST SERVICE PROVIDERS  March 2021  12  2. RISK MANAGEMENT  As mentioned in Section 1.1.3, the eIDAS Regulation requires that TSP shall take appropriate  technical and organisational measures to manage the risks posed to the security of the trust  services they provide and to minimize the impact of security incidents. Having regard to the  latest technological developments, those measures shall ensure that the level of security is  commensurate to the degree of risk.  Many standards already provide guidelines for risk management. One of them is [ISO/IEC  27005]. It provides guidelines for information security risk management in an organization,  supporting the requirements of information security management (ISMS) according to [ISO/IEC  27001]. However, this standard does not provide any specific method for information security  risk management.  Based on [ISO/IEC 27005] general approach, [ENISA Security Framework for TSPs] aims at  presenting more specific and practical guidelines for TSPs regarding the management of risks  posed to the security of their trust services.  The guidelines for QTSPs are proposed to be similar to those for TSPs. The QTSPs are  suggested to consult [ENISA Security Framework for TSPs] for a method to manage the risks  posed to the security of its qualified trust services.  2.1 RECOMMENDATIONS FOR QTSPS  Besides the guidelines proposed in [ENISA Security Framework for TSPs], this document  recommends the following.  2.1.1 Level of security required by the qualified status  The eIDAS Regulation introduced the notions of qualified trust service (QTS) and qualified trust  service provider (QTSP) with a view to indicating requirements and obligations that ensure  high-level security and a higher presumption of their legal effect. Because of this higher  presumption of legal effects (e.g. Qualified Electronic Signature, QES, has the equivalent legal  effect to handwritten signature), the consequences of a security incident can have a higher  impact on a QTSP than those of a non-QTSP, in particular for customers of the QTSP: e.g.  previously issued QES may a posteriori lose their qualified status, issued certificates cannot be  used for QES anymore, previous validations of QES may be questioned, QES may be wrongly  preserved because badly secured. Besides the impact on customers, the withdrawal of the  qualified status of a QTSP may have dramatic consequences on the viability of the QTSP; the  consequence of a security incident may cause the withdrawal of its qualified status and so the  loss of its business line and customers (e.g. customers which need qualified certificates). This  must be considered by the QTSP when estimating the level of impact of security incident on an  asset (see Section 2.2.1.5 “Identification of consequences” and Section 2.2.2.2 “Estimation of  the level of impacts” of [ENISA Security Framework for TSPs]).  Following the formula provided in Section 2.2.2.3 of [ENISA Security Framework for TSPs]:  𝑹𝒊𝒔𝒌 = 𝑻𝒉𝒓𝒆𝒂𝒕 × 𝑽𝒖𝒍𝒏𝒆𝒓𝒂𝒃𝒊𝒍𝒊𝒕𝒚 × 𝑰𝒎𝒑𝒂𝒄𝒕  As the Impact increases, the degree of risk also increases and so the level of security required  for QTSP may be higher than one for non-QTSP.  SECURITY FRAMEWORK FOR QUALIFIED TRUST SERVICE PROVIDERS  March 2021  13  Related to this, the QTSP must also formulate appropriate risk acceptance criteria, used to  evaluate the significance of a risk and to determine whether the risk is acceptable or tolerable,  which ensure that the level of security is commensurate to the degree of risk. The risk  acceptance criteria will influence the risk treatment measures.  2.1.2 Presumption of negligence  Formulating an appropriate risk acceptance criteria and implementing the adequate controls is  particularly important regarding the liability of the QTSP. The eIDAS Regulation states in Article  13: “The intention or negligence of a QTSP shall be presumed unless that QTSP proves that the  damage […] occurred without the intention or negligence of that QTSP.” This means that, in  order to prove that the QTSP operated without intention or negligence, it is essential that the  QTSP is able to demonstrate that it operated with due diligence. It is therefore highly  recommended when implementing the adequate controls to attach importance to collection of  the records, audit, and monitoring of these controls. This topic, that is certainly a best practice  for TSP, can be seen as a self-protective measure for a QTSP. Particular attention must also be  paid to the protection of such records and therefore their associated level of impact if they are  compromised.  2.1.3 Conformity assessments  Although this is a valid point for TSPs, it takes an additional importance for QTSPs to undergo a  conformity assessment (also called “audit”), since most, if not all, audit schemes require the  TSP to perform a risk assessment and to produce the related mitigation plan.  2.1.4 Measures against forgery and theft of data  The eIDAS Regulation states in Article 24.2(g) that the QTSP shall “take appropriate measures  against forgery and theft of data”. It thereby emphasizes the fact that, among the technical and  organisational measures to manage the risks posed to the security of its trust services, the  QTSP shall particularly pay attention to the forgery and theft of data. This should be considered  when identifying threats (see Section 2.2.1.2 “Identification of threats” of [ENISA Security  Framework for TSPs]).  SECURITY FRAMEWORK FOR QUALIFIED TRUST SERVICE PROVIDERS  March 2021  14  3. SECURITY INCIDENT  MANAGEMENT  [ENISA Security Framework for TSPs] already presents guidelines supporting TSP in fulfilling  the part of Article 19.1 and Article 19 by using the appropriate measures to efficiently detect,  measure, respond, report, and recover from security incidents.  The guidelines for QTSP are proposed to be identical for TSP. The QTSP is then suggested to  consult this document for more information about the appropriated measures related to security  incident management.  3.1 RECOMMENDATIONS FOR QTS  Besides the guidelines proposed in [ENISA Security Framework for TSPs], this document  recommends the following.  3.1.1 Termination plan  [ENISA Security Framework for TSPs] recommends in Section 3.4 “Recover from the incident”  to be prepared before an incident occurs with a termination plan. Such a termination plan is  mandatory for QTSP following Article 24.2(i) of eIDAS. A termination plan is a key document  regarding a QTSP/QTS. As stated in Recital (41), Article 17(4) and Article 24.2(i) of eIDAS, this  document shall be verified by the SB because of its particular importance regarding the  sustainability and durability of QTSs and to boost users’ confidence in the continuity of qualified  trust services, such as in exceptional/unfortunate cases of QTSP unscheduled termination (e.g.  bankruptcy). Detailed information on the termination plan can be found in the related section of  [ENISA Recommendations for QTSPs based on standards].  SECURITY FRAMEWORK FOR QUALIFIED TRUST SERVICE PROVIDERS  March 2021  15  4. QUALIFIED TRUST SERVICES  SECURITY MEASURES  Section 4 of [ENISA Security Framework for TSPs], called “Trust services security measures”,  proposes a list of security measures to help mitigating the risks identified in Section 2 and  monitoring security events that might be relevant for notification and remediation as identified in  Section 3. The proposed measures come from technical standards and best practices to  address common for all and with relevance with specific trust services offered.  This section proposes a list of references above those proposed in [ENISA Security Framework  for TSPs] that are targeted to QTSP/QTS.  It may be observed that the additional security measures to be implemented by QTSP/QTS are  limited. As a matter of fact, when a TSP operates with due diligence, its security measures are  similar to the security measures required to QTSP. The few additional security measures are  further detailed in the below sections.  NOTE1: As mentioned in Section 1.4, to provide QTSP with further guidance and illustration on  these policies, procedures, and processes, this document refers to ETSI and ISO/IEC  standards. These standards are not made mandatory by the eIDAS Regulation. Regarding the  ETSI standards, it is worth noting that they tailor generic risk management to eIDAS trust  services and as such, the security measures they contain may be regarded as the benchmark /  common answer to the risks that are typically identified when operating the corresponding QTS  and their components. In that respect, the categories of security measures identified in the  subsections below may be seen as “typical topics of concern” when operating a QTSP offering  a specific type of QTS.  NOTE2: This section aims at introducing a list of security measures in the context of eIDAS  Article 19 security framework, as well as pertinent security measures derived from eIDAS  articles specific to QTSP/QTS. This section does not intend to provide guidelines to achieve full  compliance of a QTSP/QTS with the requirements of eIDAS. For such guidelines, the reader  may be interested in [ENISA Recommendations for QTSPs based on standards].  4.1 SECURITY MEASURES FOR ALL QTSPS  As previously mentioned, security measures for QTSPs and non-QTSP don’t deviate much. In  fact, as part of this series of documents, the security measures proposed to QTSP/QTS are the  same as the security measures for all TSPs proposed in [ENISA Security Framework for TSPs].  These security measures are based on [EN 319 401] and are further introduced in [ENISA  Security Framework for TSPs].  However, one must note that some of the presented security measures are made mandatory for  QTSPs in the eIDAS Regulation. These mandatory requirements for all QTSPs are laid down in  Article 24.2. All of them are mapped below with their [EN 319 401] requirements (this mapping  originates from Annex A of [EN 319 411-2]):  SECURITY FRAMEWORK FOR QUALIFIED TRUST SERVICE PROVIDERS  March 2021  16  Article 24.2 states that a QTSP providing QTSs shall:  a) inform the supervisory body of any change in the provision of its  qualified trust services and an intention to cease those activities;  -  b) employ staff and, if applicable, subcontractors who possess the  necessary expertise, reliability, experience, and qualifications and  who have received appropriate training regarding security and  personal data protection rules and shall apply administrative and  management procedures which correspond to European or  international standards;  Clause 7.2  c) with regard to the risk of liability for damages in accordance with  Article 13, maintain sufficient financial resources and/or obtain  appropriate liability insurance, in accordance with national law;  REQ-7.1.1-04  d) before entering into a contractual relationship, inform, in a clear and  comprehensive manner, any person seeking to use a qualified trust  service of the precise terms and conditions regarding the use of that  service, including any limitations on its use;  Clause 6.2  e) use trustworthy systems and products that are protected against  modification and ensure the technical security and reliability of the  processes supported by them; Clause 7.5  Clause 7.6  REQ-7.4-02  REQ-7.4-03  REQ-7.4-10  Clause 7.7  Clause 7.8  f) use trustworthy systems to store data provided to it, in a verifiable  form so that:  (i) they are publicly available for retrieval only where the  consent of the person to whom the data relates has been  obtained,  (ii) only authorised persons can make entries and changes to  the stored data,  (iii) the data can be checked for authenticity;  g) take appropriate measures against forgery and theft of data6; Clause 7.2 to  Clause 7.12  h) record and keep accessible for an appropriate period of time,  including after the activities of the qualified trust service provider  have ceased, all relevant information concerning data issued and  received by the qualified trust service provider, in particular, for the  purpose of providing evidence in legal proceedings and for the  purpose of ensuring continuity of the service. Such recording may  be done electronically;  Clause 7.12  REQ-7.7-07  i) have an up-to-date termination plan to ensure continuity of service  in accordance with provisions verified by the supervisory body under  point (i) of Article 17(4);  Clause 7.12  j) ensure lawful processing of personal data in accordance with  Directive 95/46/EC;  REQ-7.13-05  Each of the points enumerated in this article are specifically covered in [ENISA  Recommendations for QTSPs based on standards].  6 This clause is discussed in Section 2.1.  SECURITY FRAMEWORK FOR QUALIFIED TRUST SERVICE PROVIDERS  March 2021  17  An important note for all QTSPs concerns their liability pursuant to Article 13 of eIDAS: “The  intention or negligence of a QTSP shall be presumed unless that QTSP proves that the damage  […] occurred without the intention or negligence of that QTSP.” This means that in order to  prove that the QTSP operated without intention or negligence, it is essential that the QTSP is  able to demonstrate it operated with due diligence. It is therefore highly recommended to QTSP  to attach a high importance to the collection and protection of the records and audits.  Regarding the collection and protection of the records and audits, it should be noted that  pursuant to Article 24.2(h) of eIDAS, it is required that they shall be made accessible for an  appropriate period of time, including after the activities of the qualified trust service provider  have ceased.  4.2 SECURITY MEASURES FOR PROVISION OF SPECIFIC QTS  4.2.1 Provision of qualified certificates  On top of the security measures for certification services provided in [ENISA Security  Framework for TSPs], this section covers additional measures applicable to the provision of  qualified certificates.  As mentioned in [ENISA Security Framework for TSPs], security requirements for the issuance  of certificates are specified in ETSI EN 319 411 parts 1 and 2 “Policy requirements for TSP  issuing certificates”. In particular, [EN 319 411-2] provides specific requirements for QTSP  issuing qualified certificates. Additional requirements related to the security framework are laid  down in:   Clause 6.5.1 on “Key Pair Generation and Installation” (complements [EN 319 411-1]  clause 6.5.1). The listed requirements concern the generation and installation of key  pairs related to qualified certificates, where the private key resides on a QSCD.  QTSP issuing qualified website authentication certificates looking for their recognition by  browsers may also be interested in [TSP Technical Best Practices], developed by  representatives of Apple, Google, Microsoft, and Mozilla.  4.2.2 Qualified validation service for QESig/QESeal  Security and policy requirements for this service are specified in [TS 119 441] “Policy  requirements for TSP providing signature validation services”.  Additional requirements for QTSP providing qualified validation service are proposed in Annex  B of this standard. Nevertheless, this Annex does not comprise any additional technical and  organisational measures to manage the risks posed to the security of the provision of this trust  service. Instead, it provides requirements to comply with Article 33 of eIDAS. This is covered  further in [ENISA Recommendations for QTSPs based on standards].  Therefore, security measures described in [ENISA Security Framework for TSPs] for signature  validation service also apply for QTSP providing qualified validation service for qualified  signatures and/or qualified seals.  4.2.3 Qualified preservation service for QESig/QESeal  Security and policy requirements for this service are specified in [TS 119 511] “Policy and  security requirements for trust service providers providing long-term preservation of digital  signatures or general data using digital signature techniques”.  Additional requirements for QTSP providing a qualified preservation service are proposed in  Annex A of this standard. Nevertheless, this Annex does not comprise any additional technical  SECURITY FRAMEWORK FOR QUALIFIED TRUST SERVICE PROVIDERS  March 2021  18  and organisational measures to manage the risks posed to the security of the provision of this  trust service. Instead, it provides requirements to comply with Article 34 of eIDAS. This is  covered further in [ENISA Recommendations for QTSPs based on standards].  Therefore, security measures described in [ENISA Security Framework for TSPs] for  preservation service also apply for QTSP providing qualified preservation services.  4.2.4 Qualified time-stamping service  Security and policy requirements for this service are specified in [EN 319 421] “Policy and  Security Requirements for Trust Service Providers issuing Time-Stamps”.  Additional requirements for QTSP providing qualified time-stamps are proposed in clause 8 of  this standard. In a nutshell, it states that:   The time-stamping unit (TSU) signature verification (public) key certificate is  recommended to be issued by a certification authority operating under [EN 319 411-2]  certificate policy;   The TSU issuing qualified time-stamps shall not issue non-qualified electronic time-  stamps. As stated in [EN 319 411-2] clause 8.1 note 2, “the relying party is expected to  use a Trusted List to establish whether the time-stamp unit and the timestamp are  qualified. If the public key of the TSU is listed in the Trusted List and the service it  represents is a qualified time-stamping service, then the time-stamps issued by this  TSU can be considered as qualified.”  4.2.5 Qualified electronic registered delivery service  Security and policy requirements for this service are specified in [EN 319 521] “Policy and  security requirements for Electronic Registered Delivery Service (ERDS) Providers” and [EN  319 531] “Policy and security requirements for Registered Electronic Mail Service (REMS)  Providers”.  These standards explicitly indicate which requirements apply to the qualified services thanks to  specific sections called “Provisions for EU QREMS/QERDS”. The content of these sections is  covered in this section; The section that applies to non-qualified electronic registered delivery  services (non-QERDS) and non-qualified registered electronic mail services (non-QREMS), are  further covered in [ENISA Security Framework for TSPs].  Regarding the management and operation of EU QREMS and QERDS, the only additional  proposed security measure targets human resources (clause 7.2.2 of [EN 319 521]) and in  particular, the necessity of an identity verification officer.  Regarding general provision on QERDS and on QREMS, clauses 5 of both standards provide  ad-hoc requirements on the QTSP. Specifically, the delta for qualified services are included in  the sections “Provisions for EU QREMS/QERDS” of the following clauses:   Clause 5.1 User content integrity and confidentiality;   Clause 5.2 Users Identification and Authentication;   Clause 5.3 Time reference;   Clause 5.4 Events and evidence;   Clause 5.5 Interoperability.  4.2.6 Remote QSCD services  The Regulation states through Recital (51) that it should be possible for the signatory (resp.  creator of the seal) to entrust QSCDs to the care of a third party, provided that appropriate  mechanisms and procedures are implemented to ensure that the signatory (resp. creator of the  SECURITY FRAMEWORK FOR QUALIFIED TRUST SERVICE PROVIDERS  March 2021  19  seal) has sole control (resp. control) over the use of his electronic signature/seal creation data,  and the qualified electronic signature/seal requirements are met by the use of the device.  As stated in eIDAS Recital (52), in order to ensure that such electronic signatures[/seals]  receive the same legal recognition as electronic signature[/seals] created in an entirely user-  managed environment, remote electronic signature service providers should:  1) apply specific management and administrative security procedures; and  2) use trustworthy systems and products.  Following 1), eIDAS requires that remote QSCDs may only be provided by QTSPs, even if this  type of service is not a qualified trust service per se. The security measures proposed in Section  4.1 for all QTSPs therefore also apply to QTSP providing remote QSCD services. Additionally,  on top of [EN 319 401], ETSI released [TS 119 431-1] proposing “Policy and security  requirements for trust service providers; Part 1: TSP service components operating a remote  QSCD / SCDev”.  Following 2), to ensure their trustworthiness, systems and products must implement appropriate  technical measures to manage the risks posed to their security. Annex II of eIDAS made some  of these security measures mandatory and also made, pursuant to Article 30(1) and 39(2) of  eIDAS, the certification against these security measures mandatory. The security framework of  such systems and products are provided in CEN [EN 419 241-2].  More information on the standards that can be used to comply with eIDAS requirements, and  relevant security measures, can be found in the related section of [ENISA Recommendations for  QTSPs based on standards].

    "abstract": "This document proposes a security framework to achieve compliance with Article 19 of the eIDAS Regulation, to which both non-QTSP and QTSP are subject. Nevertheless, Article 19.1 states that the security measures “shall ensure that the level of security is commensurate to the degree of risk”. to achieve compliance with Article 19 (valid for both, QTSPs and non-QTSPs), this series of documents recommend that the level of security implemented by non-QTSP, expected to follow ‘best practices’ when operating with due diligence, is equivalent to the one of QTSP. For this reason, the security practices applied by QTSPs are also relevant to – and can also be followed by – non-QTSPs."

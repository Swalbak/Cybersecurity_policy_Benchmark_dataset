While some years ago  applications would be mainly run on servers on their own premises or dedicated data centres, now  applications are outsourced to large Cloud service providers and run in a few large data centres.  Public data on the uptake of Cloud computing shows that in a couple of years around 80% of  organisations will be dependent on Cloud computing.  Public bodies could be a key player in Cloud computing area as it offers scalability, elasticity, high  performance, resilience and security, together with cost efficiency while in the same time it could  enable and simplify citizen interaction with government by reducing information processing time,  lowering the cost of government services and enhancing citizen data security. Governmental Clouds  offer to the public bodies, including ministries, governmental agencies and public administrations  (PAs), the potential to manage security and resilience in traditional ICT environments and strengthen  their national Cloud strategy.  ENISA has published in 2011 a guide for public bodies providing recommendations on the definition  of their security and resilience requirements and how to evaluate and choose from the different  Cloud computing service delivery models.  In this report, ENISA identifies the Member States with operational government Cloud  infrastructures and underlines the diversity of Cloud adoption in the public sector in Europe.  Moreover through this document, ENISA aims to assist Member States in elaborating a national  Cloud strategy implementation, to understand current barriers and suggest solutions to overcome  those barriers, and to share the best practices paving the way for a common set of requirements for  all Member States (MS).  The study shows that, while there is no common agreement on a definition of Governmental Cloud,  a common concept exists:   A gov-Cloud is an environment running services compliant with governmental and EU  legislations on security, privacy and resilience (what)   A gov-Cloud is a secure and trustworthy way (private Cloud or public Cloud) to run services  under public body governance (how)   A gov-Cloud is a deployment model to build and deliver services to state agencies (internal  delivery of services), to citizens and to enterprises (external delivery of services to society)  (for who)  After the examination of the wide and heterogeneous landscape of the EU countries a governmental  Cloud classification is presented based on basic criteria:   the existence of a legal background to support the implementation of Cloud computing in  administrative systems, i.e. national Cloud strategy or digital agenda,   and the phase of the governmental Cloud implementation (design, implementation, projects  running etc).  The countries studies are categorised in the following groups:   Early adopters: Countries that have a Cloud strategy and they have taken specific decisions  on how to implement the governmental Cloud.   Well - Informed: Countries that have a strategy but the implementation is still at design or  prototype stage or they have only  preliminary implementations of some governmental  Cloud services.  Good Practice Guide for securely deploying Governmental Clouds  Page  iv   Innovators :  Countries that do not have a high-level Cloud strategy with clear indications on  governmental Cloud implementation, but they already have some Cloud-based services  running.   Hesitants: Countries that do not have a governmental Cloud strategy in place nor have the  relevant Cloud initiatives or governmental Cloud experiences.  This study presents information from in total  23 European countries (20 EU countries): Austria,  Belgium, Cyprus, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Malta, Republic of  Moldova, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovenia, Slovakia, Spain, Sweden,  Turkey, UK.  Based on the study on the aforementioned Member States on their national Cloud strategy and  applications a set of recommendations on how to securely deploy governmental Clouds is  presented:   EC and MS to support the development of an EU strategy to foster the adoption of  governmental Cloud;   EC and MS to develop a business model to guarantee the sustainability and economies of  scale or governmental Cloud solutions;   MS and Cloud providers to foster the development of a framework to mitigate the “loss of  control” issue;   EC and MS to promote the definition of a regulatory framework to address the “locality  problem”;   MS and Cloud providers to encourage the development of governmental Cloud solutions  compliant with EU and country specific regulation;   EC and MS to support the development of an SLA framework;   EC and MS to foster the adoption of baseline security measures for both public and private  Cloud deployment models;   EC and MS to develop a certification framework;   Academia and Cloud providers to foster research on governmental Cloud security;   EC and MS to support  privacy enhancement in the Cloud.

The number of Member States (MS) with operational government Cloud  infrastructures is even smaller. The diversity of Cloud adoption in the public sector in Europe is  evident; in several countries local public administrators are developing Cloud strategies or launching  test bed projects; in others, Cloud is not even considered an option.  Information on the lessons learnt and best practices of the “early adopters” is not readily available.  Governmental bodies, national experts and policy makers from less advanced countries in the field  of Cloud computing struggle to find case studies and, thus, cannot benefit from the valuable  experience of other Member States.  In this study ENISA, aiming at “enabling and facilitating faster adoption of Cloud computing”  collected information on Cloud services deployed (projects, initiatives, plans) in the public sector,  collected the best practices and presents a list of recommendations, covering all aspects of  Cloud  computing. The goal is to help Member States in:   the elaboration of a national Cloud strategy,   the implementation of a national Cloud strategy and governmental Cloud infrastructure,   understanding current barriers by suggesting solutions to overcome them,   sharing the best practices and paving the way for a common set of requirements for all  Member States.  Policy Context  The European Commission (EC), under the “Digital Agend for Europe” in the context of the Europe  2020, has set as one of the objectives to support the Information and Communication Technologies  (ICT) in delivering sustainable economic and social wellfare.  The EU Cloud strategy – subtitled “Unleashing the Potential of Cloud Computing in Europe” was  launched by the European Commission in 2012. It describes the strategic plan of the European  Commission aiming to enable and facilitate the adoption of Cloud services in the public and private  Cloud computing sector across the EU. Before publishing the strategy, the Commission has  conducted several desk research studies (Cloud uptake in the EU, standardization schemes for Cloud,  Cloud contracts and SLAs), which led them to define the following key actions, closely related to  information security and certification:   Standardisation and certification: ETSI is asked to produce a map of existing standards  relevant for Cloud computing. The Commission (COM) will work with ENISA to support  development of EU-wide voluntary schemes and to make a list of such schemes by 2014.   Cloud Contract Terms: The EC will develop model terms for Cloud SLAs as well as a set of  safe and fair contract terms for consumers and SMEs. The EC will also work with experts to  develop a code of conduct for Cloud providers regarding data protection, which will be  submitted to the Article 29 Working Party for endorsement.   European Cloud Partnership: The EC will set up a European Cloud Partnership, involving  industry and public sector, which will develop common procurement requirements adapted  to European needs.  As stated in the strategy “public authorities also stand to benefit from Cloud adoption both in terms  of efficiency savings and in terms of services that are more flexible and turned to the needs of  http://ec.europa.eu/digital-agenda/ http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=COM:2012:0529:FIN:EN:PDF http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=COM:2012:0529:FIN:EN:PDF http://ec.europa.eu/information_society/activities/cloudcomputing/docs/quantitative_estimates.pdf  Good Practice Guide for securely deploying Governmental Clouds  Page  2  citizens and business. [...] Cloud computing can help drive the transition to 21st century public  services that are interoperable, scalable and in line with the needs of a mobile population and  business that want to benefit from the European digital single market”. Cloud computing is the  driveway towards the realization of the “Every European Digital” dream, where bureaucracy will be  wiped out. In the strategy ENISA was asked to support the Commission in these activities.  Target audience  The target audiences of this report are:   Public bodies in the EU (local and regional public administrations, agencies, local healthcare  authorities, etc.) evaluating the costs and benefits for a public administration considering  using Cloud services;   European Union policymakers deciding on appropriate policy and economic incentives,  legislative measures, awareness-raising initiatives, etc., vis-à-vis Cloud-computing  technologies for governments and public administrations;   Cloud providers and Cloud VAS (value-added services – including security) providers trying to  achieve an early understanding of the needs and requirements of central governments,  public administrations and citizens, to be able to develop Cloud services that are in line with  these needs and requirements.  Methodology  This study and its outcome is based on desk research, an online survey and a set of interviews to  subject matter experts: experts working in governmental agencies implementing Cloud services or  being involved in the composition of the national Cloud strategy, experts from private sector who  provide services to the public sector supporting private Clouds etc.  The interviews and the research activities focussed on the following topics:   Governmental Cloud infrastructures that are currently operational, in the planning or in the  implementation phase;   Services (both “critical” and “non critical”1) currently deployed by the governmental sector  using Cloud technologies and/or services that will be migrated to the Cloud using Cloud  technologies;   National strategies across the EU that take into account the intent to foster Cloud computing  for governmental services;   Cloud computing projects and initiatives focusing on the dissemination and delivery of  governmental Cloud services;   Risk assessment and security frameworks for Cloud Computing and public services.  The interview templates and the questionnaire have been prepared according to the results from  the survey on the state of the art and specifically designed for Cloud providers, governmental IT  agencies, and public sector stakeholders. The questionnaires and the interviews covered quite a  broad number of topics:   Practices, orientations, expectations, initiatives, projects of the stakeholders in the  deployment of public services with the adoption of Cloud technologies.  1  Critical are those assets/services whose loss would lead to “severe economic or social consequences” i.e. water, energy,  transport, communications according to CPNI, UK:  https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/78902/section-a-natural-hazards- infrastructure.pdf  https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/78902/section-a-natural-hazards-infrastructure.pdf https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/78902/section-a-natural-hazards-infrastructure.pdf  Good Practice Guide for securely deploying Governmental Clouds  Page  3   Requirements, warranties, needs, expectations of the principal actors for enforcing security  of the governmental Cloud services, the assets and the data of public institutions.   Orientations, visions, views, positions on national Cloud computing strategies and on the  guidelines for security of governmental Cloud services.  As a result, we collected information from a total of  23 European countries (20 EU countries), and  specifically: Austria, Belgium, Cyprus, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy,  Malta, Republic of Moldova, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovenia, Slovakia,  Spain, Sweden, Turkey, UK.  Structure  In Chapter 2 of this document we present the characteristics of a governmental Cloud and its  definition; in Chapter 3 we give an overview of the Cloud uptake by the public sector in Europe  classifying the respective countries according to specific criteria; in Chapter 4 we provide best  practice examples, based on the several cases of governmental Clouds in Europe; and in Chapter 5  we present a set of recommendations and actions that can implement these recommendations on  securely deploying Cloud services in the public sector. We conclude in Chapter 6 with general  remarks on the future of governmental Cloud in the EU.  Good Practice Guide for securely deploying Governmental Clouds  Page  4  2 Governmental Cloud Computing  The goal of this chapter is to provide clarity on the definition and characteristics of governmental  Cloud computing. We provide a definition of governmental Cloud computing based on experts’  feedback and an outline of current core practices  classified in a specific taxonomy that will be used  throughout the complete document for a more in-depth analysis of best practices.  2.1 Towards a definition of Governmental Cloud computing (Gov-Cloud)  The definition of governmental Cloud should be based on the widely accepted definition of Cloud  computing by the National Institution of Standards and Technology (NIST) : Cloud computing is a  model for enabling convenient, on demand network access to a shared pool of configurable  computing resources (e.g. networks, servers, storage, applications and services) that can be  rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or service provider interaction.  2  Based on the NIST definition of Cloud Computing, below are the definitions of the different  deployment models:  Deployment Model Visualization  Public Clouds: Cloud  infrastructure and  computational resources are  made available to the general  public over public network.  Public Cloud Internet  Private Cloud (in house and  out sourced) : one customer  has the exclusive access and  usage of the infrastructure  and computational resources;  hosted on the organisations  premises (on-site) or  provided by a provider (out- sourced).  Private Cloud  Provider  Private Cloud  Enterprise Network  2  IaaS: Infrastructure as a Service, PaaS: Platform as a Service, SaaS: Software as a Service.  http://www.nist.gov/  Good Practice Guide for securely deploying Governmental Clouds  Page  5  Community Cloud (on-site  and outsourced): group of  users sharing the same  infrastructure and  computational resources. Can  be implemented in the  enterprise premise (on-site)  or deployed by a company  (out-sourced).  Private Cloud  Provider  Local Cloud  Enterprise Network  For governmental Cloud services, a standard definition is not yet adopted, and while there is no  common agreement on a definition for governmental Cloud, a common concept exists:   A gov-Cloud is an environment running services compliant with governmental and EU  legislations on security, privacy and resilience (what)   A gov-Cloud is a secure and trustworthy way (private Cloud or public Cloud) to run services  under public body governance (how)   A gov-Cloud is a deployment model to build and deliver services to state agencies (internal  delivery of services), to citizens and to enterprises (external delivery of services to society)  (for who)  Even though the above elements could help defining governmental Clouds, many implementations  of eGovernment services do not meet these characteristics. All these implementations are based on  virtualisation and web services technologies, and aim at consolidating resources to reduce the  number of governmental datacentres, usually meeting none of the above mentioned attributes.  A governmental Cloud is more than a centralised platform based on virtualisation technologies,  running eGovernment services and meeting the above-mentioned requirements. A gov-Cloud is  usually based on a sustainable governmental business model allowing standardizing services and  SLAs, to save cost, to help “smartening” the society. To achieve these goals, and more specifically to  be efficient from an economic perspective, the governmental Cloud should be a deployment model  providing basic services (e.g. authentication, storage, document management, workflow  management) that would be used by governmental agencies and ministries to build eGovernment  services for internal use, internal operation and management, and for services targeting at citizens  and private companies (society).  In the same light, one of the biggest benefits (beyond cost) of leveraging public/community Clouds is  the benefit of being much more agile and efficient, in terms of speed, processing power and  elasticity. The adoption of a governmental Cloud should be also a driver / an opportunity to re-think  the way ICT resources and eGovernment services are managed at government level, and to innovate  eGovernment services. Cloud computing offers a method of driving common standardisation and  then scale down commoditisation and hence costs.  Tailored solutions to tailored requirements cost  government departments significant overhead expenditure (and in many instances duplication – as  one department specifies a solution which another department has already bought). Cloud  computing uptake both depends and facilitates standardisation on features, technology and systems  and classification against clearly documented relevant standards and best practices. Standardisation  Good Practice Guide for securely deploying Governmental Clouds  Page  6  and reuse should take place both at the level of the ICT / Cloud infrastructures and processes but  also at the level of applications and services.  Cloud computing also introduces new risks. Generally for public organizationsadopting Cloud  computing, there is a risk of loosing control over how the service is being delivered. This is of great  interest when implementing Cloud in the public sector. Particularly for small organizations it may be  hard to negotiate the right contracts and SLAs to get the proper guarantees about the delivery of the  services; this can lead to lack of governance. There are also risks if (part of) the Cloud system is  running across borders, in other  jurisdictions. In these cases there may be risks for the  confidentiality of data, privacy of personal data, but also, it may complicate auditing, fraud  investigations, and services may become subject to foreign law enforcement or surveillance  activities.  Characteristics of a governmental Cloud  Summarising, a governmental Cloud is a Cloud computing system (an infrastructure, a platform and  a set of core services) which generally satisfies the following characteristics:  A.  The Cloud services are private (single tenancy), community (agreed set of tenants) or  public (multi tenancy) Cloud to host processes and/or store data, to run eGovernment  services and that can be controlled/monitored locally or in a centralised way by the public  body;  B.  It provides a set of “building blocks” reusable services to create eGovernment services  for public administration, citizens and private companies;  C.  It can be owned and managed by central government and/or external providers/ bodies.  The central government or local bodies have the end responsibility (private or community  deployment model);  D.  There is a business model that allows operating the infrastructure, the platform and the  services and in a way guaranteeing efficiency and economy of scale;  E.  The infrastructure, the platform and the services are compliant with country  governments and EU legislations on privacy, security and resiliency (location of the Gov- Cloud: on premises or off premises Cloud).  2.2 Current core practices  To understand the practices on governmental Cloud we investigated how governmental Cloud  services are deployed (deployment models), what service models are adopted (service models), what  type of services are provided (type of gov-Cloud services), how the governmental Cloud and services  are managed (management framework), whether the adoption of Cloud computing will innovate  eGovernment services and what are the benefits of adopting Cloud computing.  Good Practice Guide for securely deploying Governmental Clouds  Page  7  Figure 1 already implemented deployment models for governmental Cloud  The preferred deployment models (Public Cloud, Private Cloud or Community Cloud) implemented  or planned to be implemented depicted in Figure 1. Figure 2 shows the most popular services  models.  Figure 2 Service models for governmental Cloud  For the identification of the type of government services, the services have been classified as  “critical” when they handle sensitive information or when the impact of a failure affects a number of  citizens/ countries  and as “non critical” when the services utilize low-sensitive information and the  requirements in terms of security are quite loose.  The services are categorised as “Government to Government”, when a public institution provides  Cloud services to others public institutions; “Government to Citizen”, when a public institution  provides services to citizens (this option includes the “Government to Private”, where the end users  are private companies) with a Cloud-based technology; “Government internal”, when the services  are for the internal ICT services of the public organisation. Survey results are reported in Figure 3.  Good Practice Guide for securely deploying Governmental Clouds  Page  8  Figure 3 Categorization of government services by criticality and target users  Another aspect examined in this report is the management framework adopted by the public  institutions for the governmental Cloud. The management framework options are “Government - Private”, when the public institutions buy the Cloud services from a private Cloud provider and/or  the public institutions are assisted in the operations, in the set-up and in the management of the  Cloud infrastructures with the help of private technology providers; “Government - Government”,  when the public institutions buy the Cloud services from another public institutions which have the  role of Cloud provider and/or the public institutions have in-house capabilities and know-how for the  overall management of the technological Cloud infrastructures. Survey results are reported in Figure  4.  Figure 4 Management framework for governmental Cloud  Good Practice Guide for securely deploying Governmental Clouds  Page  9  3 Classification of governmental Clouds across the EU  To be able to present the wide and heterogeneous landscape of the EU countries concerning  governmental Cloud a classification is needed. The basic criteria for this classification are as follows:   the existence of a policy background to support the implementation of Cloud computing in  administrative systems, i.e. national Cloud strategy or digital agenda,   and the phase of the governmental Cloud implementation (design, implementation, projects  running etc).  In the following we describe the main characteristics of each group we have identified.   Early adopters: the countries in this group are: The United Kingdom, Spain and France. They  have a Cloud strategy and they have taken specific decisions on how to implement the  governmental Cloud. A number of initiatives is already running based on Cloud solutions.   Well - Informed: the countries in this group are: The Netherlands, Germany, Republic of  Moldova, Norway, Ireland, Finland, Slovak republic, Belgium, Greece, Sweden and  Denmark. They have a strategy but the implementation is still at design or prototype stage  or they have only  preliminary implementations of some governmental Cloud services. In all  cases, they are planning to massively adopt the governmental Cloud in the future, after an  in-depth evaluation and investigation of the risks and the benefits of the Cloud solutions  they have identified for the implementation and after the analysis of the first results of the  implemented Cloud services.   Innovators :  the countries in this  group are: Italy, Austria, Slovenia, Portugal and Turkey.  The “Innovators” do not have a high-level Cloud strategy with clear indications on the  solutions for the governmental Cloud, they could have a digital agenda that considers the  adoption of Cloud computing, but they already have some Cloud-based services running,  mainly based on bottom-up initiatives. Cloud implementation is forthcoming, but will need  to be supported by a national or European high-level regulation.   Hesitants: the countries in this group are: Malta, Romania, Cyprus, and Poland. This group  is composed by countries that do not have a governmental Cloud strategy in place, they  could have a digital agenda that considers the adoption of Cloud computing but do not have  relevant Cloud initiatives or governmental Cloud experiences. They are planning to  implement governmental Cloud in the future mainly to boost the country business and  competitiveness and to attract investments.  These categories are not exhaustive, but are useful in describing the wide and heterogeneous  landscape of the EU countries. Table 1 summarizes the categories by dimension of analysis.  Good Practice Guide for securely deploying Governmental Clouds  Page  10  Early adopters Well Informed Innovators Hesitants  Political and  legal aspects  (Cloud strategy)  Cloud strategy  exists  On-going  implementation of a  Cloud strategy  Mainly limited to  the Innovation and  the digitalisation of  the public  administration  No Cloud  strategy exists  Status  (Governmental  Cloud)  Mainly  implemented  governmental  Cloud or  supporting  initiatives  The gov-Cloud is not  fully developed (in  most cases at  design/prototype  stage)  Gov-Cloud  solutions exists,  but very  jeopardised and  not integrated into  a high level  national vision  No gov-Cloud  exists  Type of Cloud  implementation  Private Cloud  (except UK where  is public Cloud)  Private Cloud  (except Sweden  where is community  Cloud)  Public/Private  Cloud  NA  Motivation for  adopting Cloud  Innovation,  Competitiveness,  efficiency, job  growth  Efficiency and cost  saving, flexibility  Harmonisation of  ICT, innovation in  the public  administration  Competitiveness  and attraction  of investments  Table 1 Categories outlined by dimensions  3.1 The “Early adopters”  The main countries composing the “Early adopters” group are: United Kingdom, Spain and France.  The “early adopters” have published a Cloud strategy and its implementation actions. Usually, they  have a number of Cloud initiatives running. In general, the ICT level of adoption in this case is very  high and quite widespread. At national level there have been a number of investments on initiatives  and activities in the area of Cloud computing funded by the government (for both private – e.g.  SMEs – and public organisations). The overall design approach in defining and implementing public  (multi-tenant) Cloud solutions is very pragmatic.  Policies, strategies and drivers  The key element of this group is the adoption of a Cloud implementation plan at national level, in  some cases with a Cloud strategy (documents, frameworks, guidelines, regulations, implementation  plans), or through a smooth migration of public services in Cloud solutions. We have encountered  differences in the maturity of the solution and in the specific characteristics of the governmental  Clouds; however, in all cases the adoption is quite widespread in administrative (various  governmental bodies involved), geographically categorized (local, national, or regional bodies) and  technical level (Cloud solutions have been adopted for a quite wide range of services - not only non- critical ones).  The most important dimension is the role played by the policy makers in preparing, developing and  driving a high-level Cloud strategy for the country in all cases with a very pragmatic way. The  definition of a Cloud strategy has been established inside a wider plan focused on a) innovation in  Good Practice Guide for securely deploying Governmental Clouds  Page  11  the public administration and efficiency in ICT, or as part of a strategy to b) support employment and  growth.  Alongside the specific strategies and Cloud related initiatives, all these countries have invested time  in supporting SMEs and research centres that have been funded with a number of projects and  initiatives related to Cloud computing, building this way steady ground for the development of Cloud  computing nationally.  Governmental Cloud practices  The governmental Cloud practices have been developed and launched by the central governmental  authorities (in particular Ministries or other governmental bodies). The projects are often linked to  other public activities or are specific initiative part of larger policies; for example, in Spain, e-invoice  services using SaaS with the SARA infrastructure.

These  countries have a “live-document”  for Cloud strategy or digital agenda, but the implementation is  mostly still at the design or prototype stage, or they have partially implemented governmental Cloud  services. Cloud computing is considered as a technical solution suitable for governmental IT services,  but mainly in the form of “private Cloud” for reasons related to privacy concerns and/or due to the  lack of compliance of the solutions of the providers to the governmental security requirements.  Currently these countries are assessing how to implement Cloud in the best way and according to  their specific needs; or have already started implementing Cloud services as a pilot, and need to  evaluate the results before fully extending Cloud services. They might have Cloud-based services not  fully running but in a development/implementation phase, Cloud based solutions only for limited  services, or only for the use of single body (e.g. public agencies in the Netherlands using SaaS  solutions, in Germany, “the technology program Trusted Cloud is the central contribution of the  BMWi (Federal Ministry of Economics and Technology) for Cloud computing program, which was  launched in cooperation with partners from industry and academia in October 2010. It is part of the  ICT strategy \"Digital Germany 2015\" and the \"High-Tech Strategy\" of the federal government). In  other cases “Cloud-like” solutions might be already in place (e.g. virtualisations of public datacentres  storage solutions in the Netherlands). The implementation is designed carefully; a number of studies  (market research, exchange with other countries, R&D preparatory work, etc.) are realised or  http://trusted-cloud.de/  Good Practice Guide for securely deploying Governmental Clouds  Page  13  planned to support Cloud deployment and to ensure the adoption of the best possible Cloud  solution. Other European countries could provide guidelines - based on previous experience.  Policies, strategies and drivers  In these countries the adoption of Cloud computing by governmental organisations is quite limited  or (in some cases) almost absent. However there is a very strong political willingness to promote and  widen the adoption of Cloud in public bodies. Within this group, the policy makers and  governmental bodies (e.g. Ministries) are indeed confident about the benefits and opportunities that  Cloud solutions can offer, specifically for the public bodies. However, all the potential constraints  and defaults are carefully considered and currently under investigation and – as a result - for most of  these countries, the political will is to go for the adoption of a “private Cloud” solution.  These countries have realised (or are willing to realise) an in-depth and extensive preparatory phase  before deciding what kind of Cloud solutions will be more suitable for the governmental bodies  organisations. Within this preparatory work, a number of market studies, evaluation of technological  solutions, definition of the specific requirements for governmental Cloud, have been realised in  order to sensibly assess all the aspects related to the adoption and migration towards the Cloud.  Governmental Cloud practices  In the “Well Informed” group, governmental Cloud computing experiences are quite limited or very  recent. However, it has been possible to outline the main characteristics of the current solutions as  well as the ones of the future solutions that these countries are willing to implement.  More general information on the status of the projects and details on the service models are  presented below.  Status Application and Services  Finland No adoption of actual “governmental Cloud”.

So  use common analysis tools, e.g. to  improve their market research and  better customize products (MIA).  The  Netherlands4  In 2011 Dutch government presented its  Cloud Strategy. The Central Government  identifies two main problems inhibiting the  implementation of Cloud computing:  the  relative immaturity of the Cloud computing  market, and the government’s highly stringent  requirements with respect to data protection  and privacy.  Initially, therefore, Cloud computing will only  be implemented internally, within the Central  Government itself. That is to say, no use will  be made of ‘open’ Cloud computing, but  rather a ‘closed’ Cloud will be set up under  Central Government’s management and  control. The Cloud will exist within Central  Government’s own secure network and be  managed by its Central Government’s own IT  staff.  As of June 2013, the Goal Architecture of the  Closed Governmental Cloud has been  approved.  Small projects have been realised at  local level, by the municipalities by  creating an autonomous and  independent datacentres.  SaaS solutions are used by agencies  responsible for different type of  policies, often for storing open data  in the Cloud  The Dutch agency responsible for  providing license plates for cars is  using the Cloud platform for its  open data.  Norway In the “Digital Agenda for Norway” published  in 2012-2013, the Norwegian State included  the Cloud Computing as one of the main key  topics.  For assisting the public and private  institutions, the Ministry of  Government Administration,  Reform and Church Affairs will  produce guidelines on the use  Cloud services, comprehending  relevant regulations and developing  specifications and standard  agreements for use in procuring  4 Interview with the Operational Management Department, Ministry of Economic Affairs, the Netherlands  http://www.c-lab.de/en/rd_projects/goberlin http://trusted-cloud.de/de/1447.php https://www.google.gr/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&ved=0CCoQFjAA&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.government.nl%2Ffiles%2Fdocuments-and-publications%2Fnotes%2F2012%2F03%2F30%2Fthe-netherlands-istrategy%2Fistrategy-nl-central-governement.pdf&ei=jqNVUv3GOcTCtAb3y4CoCw&usg=AFQjCNGiilU8zaamowoz2bOfy4_0eAw2rw&sig2=7_7aPTDSrIO45QMNCT_Wgw&bvm=bv.53760139,d.Yms http://www.schjodt.no/nyheter-innsikt/artikler/ctlr-32012-telecommunications-data-protection-cloud-computing.aspx http://www.regeringen.se/content/1/c6/18/18/01/509f1b0c.pdf http://www.regeringen.se/content/1/c6/18/18/01/509f1b0c.pdf http://www.regeringen.se/content/1/c6/18/18/01/509f1b0c.pdf  Good Practice Guide for securely deploying Governmental Clouds  Page  15  such services, as an alternative to  the standard agreements currently  used by Cloud service providers.  Ireland In 2012, the Irish Government developed the  Government Cloud Computing Strategy for  the public service, which places Cloud  computing in the heart of future government  ICT strategy: providing an approach for the  public service deploy Cloud Computing and to  undertake a comprehensive program of  Datacentre Consolidation.  Examples of Cloud initiatives: Cloud  services for research application is  the EduStorage, a new network  Cloud data storage service  deployed by HEAnet (Ireland’s  National Education and Research  Network) providing advanced  Internet and associated ICT and e- Infrastructure services to  Educational and Research  organizations.  Slovakia The Slovak Republic has already prepared the  Strategic Document for Digital Growth and  Next Generation Access Infrastructure for the  2014-2020 periods. One of the strategic  objectives and priorities, to be accomplished  by 2020, proposed under the strategic  document is for the Slovak Republic to  introduce a common Cloud platform to share  public administration services and  information.  A project entitled “Datacentre for  Towns and Municipalities” is now at  its implementation stage, with its  target outcome being Cloud  platform based electronic services  for local government authorities.  Denmark There are few experiences of governmental  Cloud. At high level, an e-governmental  strategy has been produced for the 2011-2015  period. The strategy specifically report about  an initiative for Updated rules on Cloud  computing  Small deployments across the  public sector i.e. emails etc.  Sweden There are several solutions at the moment.

However, it is not an obstacle that  halts the adoption of Cloud computing by the government; handling of security and privacy issues  could be simpler than expected, once a trustworthy relation is established with the Cloud providers.  The on-going activity focusses on how to concretely manage the relationship with the Cloud  provider, and which are the clauses the Cloud providers could fulfil. Specification of needed  certifications, SLAs, audits, security and privacy requirements are currently under investigation as  well. The fact that security requirements are not fully met by the provider is also a drawback.  Good Practice Guide for securely deploying Governmental Clouds  Page  18  Due diligence is also another drawback in this case. In particular, the issue of sharing responsibilities  among the private providers, the agencies or a public third party (if there), and the government is  very critical.  3.3 The “Innovators”  The main countries composing the “Innovators” group are: Italy, Austria, Slovenia, Turkey and  Portugal. The “Innovators” do not have a high-level Cloud strategy (they could have a digital agenda  that considers the adoption of Cloud computing) but they already have some initiatives/services  running at local level or in specific sectors (e.g. e-Health); these existing initiatives are covering  mainly (but not only) non-critical services. For most countries there is a willingness to design and  implement a public Cloud in short term (1-2 years). The adoption of Cloud is mainly due to a bottom- up approach in the building and stimulating Cloud uptake. The industry, service providers, local  agencies, SMEs play a very active role by promoting their Cloud solutions or pushing for the adoption  of innovative IT service in the public.  Several private organisations are responsible for implementing and maintaining the public Cloud  services and infrastructures, with the effect of having a number of not well harmonised services,  applications and general IT solutions that have very limited level of interoperability.  In fact there is also a fragmented and not heterogeneous environment with regards to the  applications, services, contracts and SLAs with multiple Cloud providers. However, a number of  outstanding initiatives exists (mainly started by public administrators at middle management level or  regional levels) showing a very good level of novelty and value in the adoption of governmental  Cloud services. Nonetheless, these initiatives still remain isolated, and are not integrated into a  strategic vision or at political or high-level public administration.  The issues of security and privacy in relation to the Cloud computing for the governmental bodies  have not been well addressed; in some cases such regulation is perceived either as too tight, or is  not focused on the specific needs and issues of Cloud computing for governmental institutions, or is  completely lacking. These countries look at Europe as the main actor that should start up a  “European Cloud legal framework” and drive the harmonisation of the different regulations across  the EU; specifically (and at least) Europe should push for making the governmental Cloud as a main  topic to be covered by each national ICT strategy.  Policies, strategies and drivers  The “Innovators” do not have an official governmental Cloud strategy in place, but do have policies,  frameworks, programmes, and initiatives that mainly deal with the digitalisation and innovation in  the governmental bodies and public administration. In general these countries have a variety of  public administration bodies, agencies and third parties (both at local and central level) operating  as/with/and-on-behalf of the governmental body; in some cases they also deal with the deployment  and provisioning of IT services.  In comparison to the “well informed” that are willing to adopt the Cloud but with a more long-term  schedule (3-4 years) and that already are in the phase of studying and investigating of governmental  Cloud solutions, the “Innovators” are less “long-suffering” and would like to move to the  governmental Cloud quite quickly and effectively. Assessment studies and research should be done  by a single high-level public central entity but realised in a concrete manner by each body that is  willing to move to the Cloud. From this point of view, this cluster group is very keen on having high- level guidelines in the form of regulations and legal frameworks: “practical” suggestions on how to  select, move, implement, and maintain the governmental Clouds are not perceived as relevant. It  Good Practice Guide for securely deploying Governmental Clouds  Page  19  seems that the practical implementation should be done on-the-field and to be realised by each  body itself, but of course under a Cloud strategy.  So far, there is no specific plan on the deployment type of service the governmental body should  have. In some specific cases (e.g. Austria5) the adoption of a governmental Cloud is perceived as  unfeasible at the moment due to the lack of Cloud quality criteria and certifications schemes that  would increase transparency concerning the security of public Cloud services.  Governmental Cloud practices  Despite the lack of an overall Cloud strategy and high-level vision, governmental Cloud projects are  taking place, with some peaks of excellence. The adoption of Cloud is mainly due to a bottom-up  approach (realised mainly by the middle management and the operational personnel of the public  administration or in regional cases) and is building and stimulating the Cloud uptake. In most cases  drivers of these initiatives are mainly the push for competiveness and innovations rather than the  cost-saving benefits that Cloud claims to provide. As well as for the IT adoption, also for the Cloud  most cases are running in specific sectors (e.g. e-Health) or in specific organisations (e.g. local  bodies).  To by-pass the “no-Cloud-vision” approach, some large governmental institutions have started  themselves a process toward the implementation of Cloud infrastructure owned by them, to deploy  Cloud services for internal purposes as well as for other public bodies. In this scenario, the  governmental body is not only the final user, but also becomes a Cloud provider for other public/no  public users.  As an example of good Cloud practices, large governmental institutions have started a process of  evaluation of the technological infrastructures providing Cloud services to the local municipalities  under their administration and jurisdiction. This implementation model has been perceived in a  positive way, as municipalities are reassured from the issue of controlling and managing data, which  are actually managed by a public institution.  The “innovators” look at Europe as the main actor that should start up a “European Cloud legal/  policy framework” and drive the harmonisation of the different regulations across the EU;  specifically Europe should push for making the “governmental Cloud” a main topic to be covered by  each national regulation. This framework could suggest guidelines on how to setup a Cloud strategy,  guidelines on public procurement with solutions on the locality of data and governance issues.

The Department of Treasury of the Minister of Economy  and Finance has a Cloud platform providing services that  can be used internally and by other public  administrations.  The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has developed a private  Cloud to ensure service continuity for Italians residing  abroad by strengthening active and passive security as  well as ICT safety of diplomatic-consular offices located  in areas of high conflict.  The Region of Tuscany has inaugurated the new Cloud  datacenter for providing services to the local  municipalities. At the beginning IaaS and PaaS, in the  next SaaS.  Turkey There is no national  Cloud strategy in  Turkey, but there is a  datacentre  consolidation strategy  encompassing Cloud.  E-government services are provided by communications  provider Turksat. In the education sector there are plans  to replace all books by tablets, and to provide all schools  with smart boards. The budget for this has been  allocated and the hardware is being rolled out. Some of  the hardware would have to be manufactured in Turkey.

Moreover,  the high-level legal framework is absent that should be the reference point when adopting Cloud for  governmental bodies. The need for specific regulation designed to support, promote, and fund  activities aiming at widespread of the governmental Cloud adoption is evident.  In this case, the need for national regulation (or at least guidelines), as a starting point, is considered  a catalyst to create efficiency and innovation in the governmental services and the public  administration itself, therefore spreading the innovation to all the country. In particular the adoption  of governmental Cloud, if realised under a high-level policy design, could harmonise the “plethora of  public administration IT services”, centralise and optimise resources (both tangible and non-tangible  ones), and offer an engine for competitiveness of national Cloud providers. Policy level guidelines  Good Practice Guide for securely deploying Governmental Clouds  Page  22  should be given in order to have a specific regulation for the adoption of Cloud for the governmental  bodies.  With regards to the security and privacy issues, it is perceived that addressing these requirements  will greatly increase the cost of the Cloud-based service and will also make SLAs quite complex from  the point of view of the governmental bodies (considering both the preparation of the contracts and  the actual verification during deployment). The current security and privacy regulations are  perceived to be in some cases obsolete and do not take into account the specific characteristics  (such as locality of data, governance models, offering no flexibility to the Cloud user) of Cloud  computing for governmental bodies. Therefore, the full adoption of Cloud technologies will need to  be supported by the development of an overall legal framework specifically designed for the IT for  the governmental services. The new legal framework should take into account not only technical and  commercial issues but mainly organisational ones, including the interrelation of the services  between different governmental organisations (small/large, local/central) as well as the security  governance issues. Risks such as lack of governance or cross border compliance should be dealt with  in the framework, to avoid confusion when carrying out law enforcement and to prevent  unauthorised state surveillance activities.  3.4 The “Hesitants”  The main countries composing the “Hesitants” group are: Malta, Romania, Cyprus and Poland. They  neither have a high level strategy, nor specific planning for future implementation. In most cases this  is more due to the limited resources available rather than to the lack of IT innovation. Despite the  fact that no specific policies or strategies are in place, the absence of a Cloud strategy does not  indicate that Cloud computing is perceived as an unsuitable technology for governmental IT services;  in fact in these countries there is a widespread positive attitude towards the adoption of Cloud  computing in the future.  The intention of adopting Cloud in the long term (3-4 years) exists. In parallel there is a quite diffuse  awareness (in particular from the operators providing support, R&D, and consultancy IT services to  the public administration) on the benefits of adopting Cloud, as well as the potential risks and costs  for the deployment of Cloud services. The will to implement Cloud is mainly linked to the benefits  that it could provide to the country's business activities and for attracting investments (rather than  being a benefit mainly for the governmental body itself and for the citizens). In most cases these  countries also claim that the start-up of Cloud adoption is delayed due to the lack of a European  regulation on the topic of governmental Cloud, as well as the exchange of best practices and lesson  learnt from other European countries.  National legislation or agreements between government and  vendors does not suffice due to lack of trust, transparency and new investment costs.

Good Practice Guide for securely deploying Governmental Clouds  Page  24  4 Best practice scenarios and analysis  In this chapter we present three scenarios, based on the three first categories described above. A  SWOT analysis per scenario is conducted at the end of each scenario. The scenarios are based on the  actual situation in Europe, as presented in chapter 2 and 3, with some additional elements.  4.1 A Governmental Cloud Catalogue  Having adopted a national Cloud strategy, a European country “Greenshore” seeking to support  governmental bodies in the smooth adoption of Cloud solutions, sets up a governmental Cloud  catalogue to be used by governmental bodies. In the catalogue, each provider (big providers or  SMEs) can offer their product: the types of Cloud services provided are IaaS, PaaS and SaaS with a  large range of categories of services i.e. email, storage, website, CRMs, collaboration applications  etc. The implementation model is public Cloud, meaning that the Cloud resources of the providers  are shared and used by multiple customers. Each provider listed the catalogue has its own  infrastructure to support the services offered. The idea behind this national project is that  government will eliminate all the drawbacks that were keeping the governmental bodies from going  into the Cloud.  In essence, what this catalogue (implemented by public sector) offers is an intermediary solution for  contract enforcement and security accreditation, held by a governmental organization.  Before  procuring a service, a risk assessment by public agencies is taking place; they analyse the Cloud- based solutions and verify if the candidate services meet the specific requirements (including  security and privacy issues). The providers joining this catalogue should be compliant to a baseline  set of security requirements; the requirements will include measures categorized in different risk- impact maturity levels. A specific procedure is in place for this task and when it is complete the  service is accredited and can be used by governmental agencies.  This catalogue is open for providers based in Greenshore, reassuring that the datacentres are in  Greenshore and falling no other jurisdiction but Greenshore’s. If a foreign provider would like to  offer services, additional security requirements must be met and adopt the contractual clauses on  data protection. To allow more SMEs to participate in this project, the accreditation process is free  of charge and obligatory to all potential providers. In the offered services list, it is signified if the  service is accredited or not. This way the buyers know which service is suitable or not for handling  sensitive or personal data. The pre-assurance is not only helping SMEs but everybody in stream- lining the process, cutting costs, standardising and re-using without the need to engage in re- assurance.  All providers of services or applications in the catalogue need to be pre-assured as do the  service assembly workloads and the deployment and life-cycle management processes of the  government catalogue.  Below we conduct a SWOT analysis for the scenario described above.  Strength  Security guarantees.

Municipalities, counties and regions have been using shared  computing resources and infrastructure already for a long time, to run applications and databases  supporting processes such as population registers, issuance of identity documents, registration of  vehicles, or budget planning and management.  The cornerstone of this structure is based on the fact that the corresponding administrative bodies  founded ICT service providers, wholly owned by them (ICT service provider is part of administrative  bodies). These service providers were tasked with setting up and running datacentres in the  corresponding administrative regions, hosting the applications used to support most of the  administrative processes of the participants, and in many cases also managing the networks  connecting the users to the datacentres. The owners of the ICT services are the different  governmental institutions.  Recently, many of these IT service providers have been introducing new services explicitly branded  as “Cloud” services.  This model has allowed the participating administrative bodies to benefit from significant economies  of scale. It can be seen as a good example of the “community Cloud” model (used by a closed group  of independent entities).  The approach predates the development of the Cloud computing concept itself and also Fairlyn’s  Digital Agenda, and therefore didn’t follow a defined strategy initially. However, exchange of  Good Practice Guide for securely deploying Governmental Clouds  Page  26  information about good practices and lessons learned both among the participating administrations  (i.e. the customer side) and the different regional service providers (i.e. the provider side) has led to  a surprisingly homogeneous picture.  In its recently finalised Digital Agenda, the government of Fairlyn recognises the potential offered by  this successful model, and aims to build on the experience gathered in the past. Fairlyn’s Digital  Agenda calls for increased standardisation of IT environments across several levels of public  administration, and for increased cooperation between the different regional datacentres, to further  improve the economies of scale, and to enable new operation modes increasing the resilience of the  services.  Strength  Strategic vision for the development of a  government-wide “i-infrastructure”. The  strategy will aim at realizing a “closed” Cloud  infrastructure under the Central Government’s  management and ownership, as unique ICT  infrastructure for the public sector  Clear “step-by-step” plan for introduction of  secure Cloud services. The Cloud strategy is  particularly focused on implementing a gradual  introduction of Cloud technologies in the public  sector, with intermediate steps for the analysis  of the results and decision for the further  progress of diffusion of Cloud services  Accurate preliminary analysis of the Cloud  computing risks and benefits. A set of research  studies for the deep understanding of the Cloud  computing risks and benefits has been  conducted, covering the aspects about security  and data privacy issues and the compliance of  the Cloud technologies.

Feedback from some  public agencies not to use Cloud infrastructure  for high sensitivity data could become  problematic.  Table 9 SWOT analysis of the “Well Informed” scenario  4.3 Building a National Cloud Infrastructure Based on Open Source  In this country, “Atlandia”, there is no Cloud strategy; the government doesn’t consider Cloud  adoption as a priority. However the external commercial providers’ community is very active in this  domain; a national initiative was launched to support universities, research centres and other public  academic institutions in building the “Academic Cloud”. A local network provider (networks and  public infrastructures, not telecommunications), contracted by the government, with the assistance  of other small providers (SMEs consortium) built a Cloud platform where students can enrol for free,  create a virtual machine, connect to virtual networks and the Internet and gain process to all the  academic books shared in the country. The vision behind this is to offer scalability, a service open to  everyone, no customer lock-in (by the vendor) and low admin costs making it accessible to small  admin teams.  The provider offers a public IaaS solution, with datacentres located in Atlandia (and under the data  protection law of Atlandia, compliant with the EU data protection law) offering storage solutions,  with all stacks being built using open source software. Other members of the consortium offer back  up services to the main datacentre. According to the requirements of the customer the service can  be updated to provide flexibility. Data storage and processing procedures are compliant with  national data law.  In IaaS security is a non-trivial matter; it is considered a feature covered by the provider via security  measures i.e. firewall services. When building the virtual machine, use of encryption methods is  suggested. It is very important that security is integrated at the lowest level; one can have very  secure platforms and software, but the “construction” will collapse if the underlying infrastructure is  compromised.  Plans for the future are mainly for SaaS: email, document management, office  automation service used by the government and public bodies will be moved to Cloud.  Below we conduct a SWOT analysis for the scenario described above.  Strength  Strategic relevance of Cloud computing for the public  sector. Cloud computing is considered strategic for  the public sector because this service can be used by  governmental bodies. This example can be a model  for when considering implementation in the  administrative systems.  Security is considered as an important aspect of the  IaaS. Often, local laws and regulations prevent the use  Weakness  Needs of high-level guidelines. The lack of  high-level guidelines covering technical,  legal and organisational issues is a major  concern i.e. procurement guidelines for  securely procure services for the citizens,  contractual recommendations for public  sector.

So security is very  important for IaaS providers. Projects and initiatives  of governmental Cloud infrastructures have started  with a bottom-up approach and security is part of all  layers.  Lack of open source software support.  Service level for supporting open source  software may not correspond to  expectations (maintenance, patching,  updating etc).  Opportunities  The governmental agencies will adopt a Cloud-based  paradigm in IaaS.

Threats  Cloud services from private Cloud  providers are not addressed at all. The  high-level guidelines should include  recommendations for services of private  Cloud providers.  Security and privacy aspects to be  addressed in case of extending to PaaS/  SaaS.  Before making the services available  to governmental bodies, all security aspects  should be addressed. The provider should  find a way to guarantee baseline security  measures compliance.  Table 10 SWOT analysis of the “Innovators” scenario  Good Practice Guide for securely deploying Governmental Clouds  Page  29  5 Recommendations  Based on the current situation in Europe concerning the adoption of Cloud computing and the  derived scenarios, we present a set of recommendations on how to securely deploy governmental  Clouds. A description of the recommendations follows as well as the actions that need to be taken to  fulfil them:   EC and MS to support the development of an EU strategy to foster the adoption of  governmental Cloud;   EC and MS to develop a business model to guarantee the sustainability and economies of  scale or governmental Cloud solutions;   MS and Cloud providers to foster the development of a framework to mitigate the “loss of  control” issue;   EC and MS to promote the definition of a regulatory framework to address the “locality  problem”;   MS and Cloud providers to encourage the development of governmental Cloud solutions  compliant with EU and country specific regulation;   EC and MS to support the development of an SLA framework;   EC and MS to foster the adoption of baseline security measures for both public and private  Cloud deployment models;   EC and MS to develop a certification framework;   Academia and Cloud providers to foster research on governmental Cloud security;   EC and MS to support  privacy enhancement in the Cloud.

This  slow take-up is due to many issues described above related to security, loss of control, data  protection and awareness. Although existing or proposed security legislative pieces cover some of  the security aspects, the use of Cloud computing has a significant impact in differentiating how IT  and services operate and their adoption will have to lead to a revision of such security measures  Our study reveals that the adoption of gov-Cloud in a systemic way is more advanced in countries  that already have a national strategy addressing the Cloud computing adoption. Moreover, many  experts are convinced that the development of an EU strategy focussing only on public sector and  national strategies for governmental Cloud computing will foster the adoption of gov-Cloud in the  EU countries.  Actions  Some recommendations based on our findings:  1. To elaborate and design a strategy with high-level guidelines, covering technical, legal and  organisational issues. The clear definition of the governance model for the Cloud initiative  should be defined before the implementation phase. A coherent plan presenting the  objectives and the vision of the governmental bodies, the agile dissemination of Cloud  services within several public institutions, and if a centrally designed strategy is defined, is  needed. The lack of strategy and the deficiency on technical, legal and procedural aspects  are critical obstacles for the start-up of governmental Cloud services.  2. To consider a program that can envisage the incremental introduction of secure Cloud  services, with a step-by-step execution plan and with meaningful deliverables and  milestones. A \"step-by-step\" plan would be an option for gradually introducing the Cloud in  the public sectors, by taking more confidence to the technologies during a soft transition  period, and thus permitting the public institutions to assimilate the new way of managing  and deploying IT services and core processes for IT operations.  3. To promote well-informed, risk-based policies that will encourage and stimulate the start-up  of Cloud in the public sectors and encourage use of external public Cloud solutions for the  “open data”. The policies should facilitate the ability of governmental bodies to choose  Cloud computing for their services. “Cloud first policy” that is currently adopted in UK,  Netherlands, the Republic of Moldova and the US FedRAMP program could support growth  in Cloud computing. The “Cloud first policy” recommends the public sector organisations to  consider and evaluate potential Cloud solutions first – before making any new investments  for new services.  4. To relate the national Cloud strategy with projects and initiatives for increasing the  government ICT efficiency and datacentre simplification. Initiatives for datacentre  consolidation and/or ICT portfolio assessment can become important drivers to boosting the  Cloud computing strategy; at the same time, Cloud computing can accelerate datacentre  consolidation efforts and ICT portfolio simplification by reducing the number of applications  hosted within government datacentre.  5. To evaluate the option of the public Cloud deployment model. Public Cloud is a more viable  option for the public sector for leveraging some of the main benefits of Cloud computing  paradigm, if security issues and concerns are addressed. In a strategy for the Cloud  computing with step-by-step execution planning, the public Clouds could be deployed for  non-critical services or in a second phase of the implementation of the strategy.  6. The MSs need to ensure the strategy’s compliance with laws, regulations, and national  agency requirements for the security and data protection.  The MS should also make sure  Good Practice Guide for securely deploying Governmental Clouds  Page  32  that the national strategy is be compliant to national and EU laws and regulations on  security and protection of information, assets, and infrastructures and taking into account  the privacy of data. We encourage that the EC adopts one European set of rules and  regulations concerning security and privacy, to support MS in this action.  7. To evaluate options for developing government service catalogues encompassing pre- assured Cloud products / applications and services catalogues, which are further classified  against targeted government Cloud platforms, usage profiles and best-practices  5.2 Recommendation 2: a business model to guarantee sustainability  Today, the private Cloud model (governance and use in the governmental institution) is the most  widely used in EU governmental Clouds (as indicated by the 57% of the experts interviewed). The  slow take-up of the public Cloud model found roots in regulatory weaknesses and immaturity of  public Cloud solutions. The relative immaturity of the Cloud computing market creates three  significant difficulties:  1. Although there are plenty of providers of Cloud computing services, most are start-ups, and  therefore cannot guarantee the level of stability that a company partnering with the  government would need to have.  2. Most solutions have so far been designed for the business context. As a result, few open  Cloud solutions on the market can meet the specific requirements of government.  3. Few solutions on the market today take account of the government’s special responsibility  for data protection. As a result, there are still relatively few open Cloud computing solutions  on the market that would be suitable for use by the Central Government.  However, to build and operate a private Cloud, migrating existing services could be really expensive  and the development of cost model capable to evaluate the real cost saving is actually a difficult  task. To really boost the adoption of governmental Cloud, EC and MS competent authorities, in  cooperation with Cloud providers, should develop a business model that will guarantee the  efficiency and the economy of scale of the governmental Cloud solutions. The solution is to move  towards the use of an appropriate public/community Cloud business model. This model will reduce  costs to improve data and service availability, service reliability and security.  Actions  A pan European regulatory framework is needed to enable the adoption of multi-tenancy  infrastructures and service sharing among governments. This framework should address the  problem of data and service locality. The framework should also address issues that come with  changing Cloud vendor or terminating a Cloud contact. It should be focusing on the terms and  conditions that should be in a SLA, and the enforceability of those terms and conditions to do so.  Second, an independent third party assurance can contribute to building trust whereby European  SME's and other organizations will use Cloud computing services more. The idea is to establish a  maturity level based framework, where governmental institutions will accredit the Cloud vendor,  and offers a kind of active and proactive escrow service by a third party, in such a way that this party  can assure a seamless takeover of the Cloud operations that provider A executes for a user to Cloud  provider B. This should therefore include the (functionality of the) software, the users’ data and the  current state of transactions.  Third, the public Cloud providers should improve their reputation and  trustworthiness.  More specifically a public/ community Cloud business model should be supported by:   An EU regulation on the use of multi-tenant infrastructures for eGovernment services;  Good Practice Guide for securely deploying Governmental Clouds  Page  33   A framework to evaluate/certify the public Cloud provider qualification (e.g. introducing  light auditing procedures, voluntary certification scheme)-(more details in recommendation  5.8);   A public procurement framework for all governmental bodies that need to procure Cloud  services;   Creating a legal framework to deal with cross border procurement;   The definition of standard procedures for application and data migration;   A framework to monitor/control data locality and data handling in general.  5.3 Recommendation 3: a framework to mitigate the “loss of control” issue  Loss of control of data and resources is one of the main barriers to gov-Cloud take-up, as indicated  by the 58% of the experts interviewed. The “loss of control” issue is not only a matter of  technologies but also of awareness, transparency, regulation, contractual agreements between  providers and governmental customers.  For example, from a theoretical point of view, when a governmental institution puts data and  applications in the Cloud it still remains the owner but, the lack of transparency of the Cloud  provider procedures (e.g. standard procedures for data disruption), the lack of common contractual  clauses and of an EU regulation, still leaves doubts on the Cloud provider potential to access and  ability to manipulate customers data. Another aspect of “loss of control” is the vendor lock-in  problem i.e. what is the mitigation action for bankruptcy of the Cloud provider cases. Concerning  vendor lock-in, from a technical point of view, without cost and time constraints, it should always be  possible to migrate data and applications from one Cloud provider to another. All these provisions  need to be agreed and declared in the services contract.  Actions  EC and MS competent authorities in cooperation with Cloud providers and government customers  should closely work to mitigate “loss of control” addressing the issues of governance, monitoring  and auditing, vendor lock-in and data handling. Required steps are:   Definition of a monitoring framework for Gov-Cloud public service layers. This monitoring  framework should allow central and local government to oversiee the Gov-Cloud platform  (operated by the CSP) running their eGovernment services. The monitoring framework,  provided itself as a Cloud service, should allow the proper view of the system, depending on  the service level used to implement the eGovernment services, i.e. IaaS, PaaS or SaaS. This  monitoring framework could become, in some cases, an alternative to auditing practices  that are discouraged by providers.   Definition of standard procedures for data handling. The standard procedures for data  handling should clearly define what are the access policies on data and applications for the  different service levels, how data are physically (or virtually) handled during the contract and  after a contract resolution.   Definition of standard procedures for data and service migration. The standard procedures  should clearly define the process behind the migration of services and data and the role of  the provider and of the customer in this process.  5.4 Recommendation 4: a regulatory framework to address the “locality  problem”  Cloud providers usually store data in their datacentres which can be located in many different  countries. The possibility to locate data and resources outside the country is often perceived as a  Good Practice Guide for securely deploying Governmental Clouds  Page  34  barrier for gov-Cloud adoption rather than an advantage for data privacy issues. The definition of  regulatory framework for data location can reduce the risks of objections from the governmental  users, but the most critical concern for data protection is to ensure the security of data more than  location of data. To achieve this, technical solutions (as for example, the use of encryption) are also  indicated as appropriate (see Recommendation 6). However, it is not only about taking technical  measures. Often local jurisdiction simply forbids that data owned by Government is located abroad.  Second, it is not only about location, but also about under which legal framework the Cloud provider  falls.  However it is important to note that it will be difficult and cost prohibitive for smaller countries to be  able to establish their own datacentres, we well as back-up centres. The regulatory framework  should take this into account  and offer solutions to overcome it.  Actions  The definition of a new framework requires that EC and MS competent authorities in cooperation  with Cloud providers and government customers to work closely on the following topics:   Definition of measures to improve the awareness of government agencies and Cloud service  providers on existing EU legislation on the subject;   Foster the development of technological solutions compliant with the existing legislation;   Categorization of specific governmental institution requirements on data ownership and  data privacy judged by the type of data handled;   Enhancement of the existing EU legislation on data and resource ownership with a focus  outsourcing;   Enhancement of the existing EU legislation on data privacy with a focus on outsourcing.  5.5 Recommendation 5: governmental Cloud solutions compliant to EU and  national law  To soften the scepticism of governmental institutions of the technological solution proposed by  service providers, measures should be promoted to encourage the development of systems and  services that are compliant with EU regulation and specific country legislation.  Actions  EC and MS competent authorities in cooperation with Cloud providers, governmental bodies,  standardisation bodies and R&D sector should closely work to promote the development of  technological solutions compliant to EU and national regulation.  Needed steps could be to:   Setup of an accreditation(certification) framework to certify or guarantee that each Cloud  solution is compliant with the relevant legislation (national and/or EU law) – specific  recommendation 8;   Promote the definition of standard contracts including regulatory compliance;   Promote the awareness of EU and country regulation;   Promote Cloud trainings and education on Cloud topics for EU governments.  Good Practice Guide for securely deploying Governmental Clouds  Page  35  5.6 Recommendation 6: a common framework for SLAs  The development of a common framework for standard service level agreements is largely debated  in the community. Survey results suggest (from a governmental customer’s point of view) additional  clauses: allowing penetration tests (about 60% of respondents to our survey), obligatory incident  reporting (about 65% of respondents to our survey) and the right to conduct auditing to the Cloud  provider (about 75% of respondents to our survey).  A common framework for SLAs should be a measure to boost the take-up of gov-Clouds. Having a  SLA framework will overthrow the difficulties government agencies could find in the definition of  contracts and the scepticism to public Cloud solutions. This work has been initiated in the EU Cloud  Strategy and ENISA has a supportive role.  Actions   Assurances and guarantees linked to the public organizations by the Cloud providers to  support security and privacy claims should be verified and assessed through the specific  penetration tests and with the introduction of auditing activities possibly through  independent third parties. Customers can leverage the attestations/reviews by 3rd party  auditors to avoid duplication.   The incident response and reporting obligation should be enforced in the contract with the  aims to push the providers to respond promptly to incidents, to report the ones that deem  critical and affect the availability of the services to the appropriate authorities and/or the  public users and to recover rapidly from the faults or the attacks.   The incident response and reporting is especially needed in the context of public services of  some level of criticality for the type of services or the sensitivity of the data. For those cases,  it should be helpful to differentiate the SLAs in terms of timelines of the response and the  reporting.   Penalties in case of service level constraints violation should be included in the contract. It  might be worth considering the creation of a reputation system (if not an entirely voluntary  accreditation scheme) that is used to inform of past violations to contracts of a similar  service or against similar standardised classifications.  5.7 Recommendation 7: Security measures for governmental Cloud  To define standard approach and procedures for the security certification of the services and/or the  providers. To ensure security for the public institutions, a maturity model must be developed;  consisting of sophistication levels that Cloud providers have to adapt via a certification scheme and  by defining clearly the requirements of each level of security. The accreditation model of the Cloud  services can be done by a dedicated central actor. The public users and providers should be free to  choose the level of security provided and requested for the public services, with positive effects on  the competition between providers and leaving the departments the possibility for implement the  most effective and the best value for money solutions. A set of security measures is the next step  after a risk assessment that should take place before deploying Cloud services. A specific set of  security measures focussed on governmental Cloud deployment would be the way to improve  trustworthiness in the Cloud supply chain.  Actions  Suggested actions to enhance the security and protection of information for the governmental Cloud  services are:  Good Practice Guide for securely deploying Governmental Clouds  Page  36   Support pre-assessment process before procuring services;   Create a set of  baseline security measures focussed on governmental Clouds; for this reason  the measures should include domains like security management, identity management, data  redundancy, services availability etc;   Include risk impact levels in each domain in order to offer a sohpistication/maturity model;   Enable voluntary auditing (and/or certification) framework of information security measures   Foster security labelling systems.  5.8 Recommendation 8: Certification framework  While considering a public-private management framework, 87% of respondents declared they  require the certification of the providers participating in public tender for governmental Cloud  services. The problem is when considering the public-public management framework because  certifications within the public institutions are not widely diffused. The governmental institutions  prefer to be compliant to standards without the need to be certified by an external auditor.  Currently the European Commission, under the EU Cloud Strategy, has launched the activities  supporting certification in the Cloud and more specifically creating one metaframework for all  providers to be accredited against. ENISA, is part of the selected industry group in charge of this  action, and fully supports the EC. This work has been initiated in the EU Cloud Strategy and ENISA  has a supportive role.  Actions   Moving towards the certification of gov-Cloud platform and services is a debated and  difficult process. The main driver to accomplish the goal can be to include this obligation in  an EU regulatory framework or a pan European voluntary certification scheme.   Consider leveraging global, industry led standards, as well as exploring government  requirements in other countries.   Support the creation of national “pre-assured Cloud products/applications and service  catalogues”. This approach reduces the cost of the service to be assured many times  introducing the “assure once- deploy many times” model.   This action can be combined with the previous recommendation on the security measures,  creating a pan European accreditation system for all providers that would like to offer Cloud  services to the public sector. A metaframework on information security domains, including  security controls per domain, classified in sophistication levels is a good starting point.  5.9 Recommendation 9: Foster research on governmental Cloud security.  To support the evolution of Cloud technologies compliant with government requirements it is  important to foster research on gov-Cloud computing leveraging existing research programmes.  Research should be oriented improve the risk-impact level of Cloud solution for governmental  services.  EC and the MSs R&D competent authorities in cooperation with academia, Cloud providers should  assure that existing and future national and European research programmes, such as Horizon 2020,  will incorporate into their work programmes research lines on gov-Cloud computing security  aspects. Some of these research lines (non-exhaustive list) are:   Cloud service life cycle management;  Good Practice Guide for securely deploying Governmental Clouds  Page  37   Cloud supply chain control;   Incident management;   Cyber risk analysis;   Cyber threat modeling;   Encryption;   Data protection;   Cloud privacy and security metric;   Privacy level agreement;   Data protection accountability and transparency;   Information assurance in Cloud systems.  Actions  EC and MS competent authorities in cooperation with Cloud providers, government customers, R&D  sector and academia should undertake the following actions:   Establish priorities for the different research objectives;   Make contact with existing security programmes at EU and National levels, such as Horizon  2020;   Work together with appropriate organisations and bodies (e.g. Framework Programme  Committee and Advisory Groups, Technology Platforms, etc.) to define an appropriate Work  Programme.  5.10 Recommendation 10: Privacy enforcement  Data protection is a vital aspect when we talk about governmental Clouds due to the sensitivity of  the information processed. The EC and MS should ensure Cloud services compliance with the EU  data protection laws. To guarantee privacy in the Cloud services encryption by the Cloud provider  and authenticated access by the users seems to be a straightforward solution. However the  implementation of cryptographic solutions in Cloud services still remains in low maturity level.  Actions  Data protection enforcement techniques have become a core issue; access control and  cryptographic techniques may provide part of the solution:   A clearly expressed and up-to-date policy about the management of personal information by  the agency, including information about likely disclosures to overseas recipients should be  considered;   In public Clouds usage of cryptographic solutions should be considered;   In IaaS and PaaS, as well as in private Clouds, cryptography doesn’t promote privacy  guarantees. In the private Cloud data security should be assured by other means like access  control, than cryptographic techniques;   In SaaS provisining, the provider should include cryptographic solutions to the contractual  agreement with the customer by default and not upon request;   When privacy is explicitly required in IaaS and PaaS, alternative solutions to the IaaS or PaaS  provider offering cryptographic  functions need to be considered. These may include the  government service encrypting data prior to their storage in the Cloud or the use of  cryptographic services (such as key management servers, access policy for the servers) that  are hosted and managed by a 3rd party (preferably a government department or a trusted  Good Practice Guide for securely deploying Governmental Clouds  Page  38  security service provider) that enable controling and attesting the enforcement of  cryptographic operations on the IaaS and PaaS environment.  Good Practice Guide for securely deploying Governmental Clouds  Page  39  6 Conclusions and next steps  This study has presented the Cloud computing status of a majority of European countries, giving the  initial impressions on how the European landscape is currently on the matter. The first conclusions  are evident: the Cloud uptake in Europe is not accelerated as expected in the European countries; in  this project, by investigating on the governmental Cloud uptake in the European countries, we  identified several issues that still need to be solved to give a boost to the public sector to adopt:   Lack of a concrete and unanimous definition of governmental Clouds;   The Cloud uptake in national level is slow due to lack of national Cloud strategies, privacy  and security constraints, lack of legal and contractual frameworks and relative immaturity of  the Cloud market;   Research needs to be promoted since many areas are still “undiscovered”.  Due to great diversity of Cloud solutions and the different approaches, it is difficult to reach a  consensus on fundamental aspects of Cloud security such as: common Cloud contract clauses,  common Cloud services model etc. In a relatively new environment with great deal of  competitiveness, getting all the big players together in a room and decide upon a baseline of  common requirements and models is a “mission impossible”.  This study is addressed to both the EC and the Member States. On the one hand the Member States  now are aware of the status of Cloud services implementation across the EU; knowledge can work as  an accelerator to the elaboration and implementation of a national Cloud strategy. The use cases  presented, demonstrate best practices on how to implement the provisions (or not) of a national  Cloud strategy according to the target outcome. The goal is to foster an information sharing  mentality between the respective parties across the EU, share the good practices and lesson learnt  and pave the way for a common set of security requirements for all Member States.  On the other hand, as indicated by the recommendations made in this study, the EC can play a very  important role in leading this kind of initiatives, bringing all the related parties (in collaboration with  the public and private sector) together to decide upon a common Cloud roadmap for Europe.  Taking into account the recommendations of this report, ENISA will continue to support all these  actions, by providing advice and recommendations to the Member States and competent  authorities. We will continue working on the topic of governmental Clouds deployment, scanning  Europe to investigate the Cloud uptake by the public sector, working on public procurement  requirements and issuing recommendations on how to design and implement a national Cloud  strategy. ENISA will also support the development of a pan European security certification  metaframework, working closely with the EC.

While some years ago  applications would be mainly run on servers on their own premises or dedicated data centres, now  applications are outsourced to large Cloud service providers and run in a few large data centres.  Public data on the uptake of Cloud computing shows that in a couple of years around 80% of  organisations will be dependent on Cloud computing.  Public bodies could be a key player in Cloud computing area as it offers scalability, elasticity, high  performance, resilience and security, together with cost efficiency while in the same time it could  enable and simplify citizen interaction with government by reducing information processing time,  lowering the cost of government services and enhancing citizen data security. Governmental Clouds  offer to the public bodies, including ministries, governmental agencies and public administrations  (PAs), the potential to manage security and resilience in traditional ICT environments and strengthen  their national Cloud strategy.  ENISA has published in 2011 a guide for public bodies providing recommendations on the definition  of their security and resilience requirements and how to evaluate and choose from the different  Cloud computing service delivery models.  In this report, ENISA identifies the Member States with operational government Cloud  infrastructures and underlines the diversity of Cloud adoption in the public sector in Europe.  Moreover through this document, ENISA aims to assist Member States in elaborating a national  Cloud strategy implementation, to understand current barriers and suggest solutions to overcome  those barriers, and to share the best practices paving the way for a common set of requirements for  all Member States (MS).  The study shows that, while there is no common agreement on a definition of Governmental Cloud,  a common concept exists:   A gov-Cloud is an environment running services compliant with governmental and EU  legislations on security, privacy and resilience (what)   A gov-Cloud is a secure and trustworthy way (private Cloud or public Cloud) to run services  under public body governance (how)   A gov-Cloud is a deployment model to build and deliver services to state agencies (internal  delivery of services), to citizens and to enterprises (external delivery of services to society)  (for who)  After the examination of the wide and heterogeneous landscape of the EU countries a governmental  Cloud classification is presented based on basic criteria:   the existence of a legal background to support the implementation of Cloud computing in  administrative systems, i.e. national Cloud strategy or digital agenda,   and the phase of the governmental Cloud implementation (design, implementation, projects  running etc).  The countries studies are categorised in the following groups:   Early adopters: Countries that have a Cloud strategy and they have taken specific decisions  on how to implement the governmental Cloud.   Well - Informed: Countries that have a strategy but the implementation is still at design or  prototype stage or they have only  preliminary implementations of some governmental  Cloud services.  Good Practice Guide for securely deploying Governmental Clouds  Page  iv   Innovators :  Countries that do not have a high-level Cloud strategy with clear indications on  governmental Cloud implementation, but they already have some Cloud-based services  running.   Hesitants: Countries that do not have a governmental Cloud strategy in place nor have the  relevant Cloud initiatives or governmental Cloud experiences.  This study presents information from in total  23 European countries (20 EU countries): Austria,  Belgium, Cyprus, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Malta, Republic of  Moldova, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovenia, Slovakia, Spain, Sweden,  Turkey, UK.  Based on the study on the aforementioned Member States on their national Cloud strategy and  applications a set of recommendations on how to securely deploy governmental Clouds is  presented:   EC and MS to support the development of an EU strategy to foster the adoption of  governmental Cloud;   EC and MS to develop a business model to guarantee the sustainability and economies of  scale or governmental Cloud solutions;   MS and Cloud providers to foster the development of a framework to mitigate the “loss of  control” issue;   EC and MS to promote the definition of a regulatory framework to address the “locality  problem”;   MS and Cloud providers to encourage the development of governmental Cloud solutions  compliant with EU and country specific regulation;   EC and MS to support the development of an SLA framework;   EC and MS to foster the adoption of baseline security measures for both public and private  Cloud deployment models;   EC and MS to develop a certification framework;   Academia and Cloud providers to foster research on governmental Cloud security;   EC and MS to support  privacy enhancement in the Cloud.

The number of Member States (MS) with operational government Cloud  infrastructures is even smaller. The diversity of Cloud adoption in the public sector in Europe is  evident; in several countries local public administrators are developing Cloud strategies or launching  test bed projects; in others, Cloud is not even considered an option.  Information on the lessons learnt and best practices of the “early adopters” is not readily available.  Governmental bodies, national experts and policy makers from less advanced countries in the field  of Cloud computing struggle to find case studies and, thus, cannot benefit from the valuable  experience of other Member States.  In this study ENISA, aiming at “enabling and facilitating faster adoption of Cloud computing”  collected information on Cloud services deployed (projects, initiatives, plans) in the public sector,  collected the best practices and presents a list of recommendations, covering all aspects of  Cloud  computing. The goal is to help Member States in:   the elaboration of a national Cloud strategy,   the implementation of a national Cloud strategy and governmental Cloud infrastructure,   understanding current barriers by suggesting solutions to overcome them,   sharing the best practices and paving the way for a common set of requirements for all  Member States.  Policy Context  The European Commission (EC), under the “Digital Agend for Europe” in the context of the Europe  2020, has set as one of the objectives to support the Information and Communication Technologies  (ICT) in delivering sustainable economic and social wellfare.  The EU Cloud strategy – subtitled “Unleashing the Potential of Cloud Computing in Europe” was  launched by the European Commission in 2012. It describes the strategic plan of the European  Commission aiming to enable and facilitate the adoption of Cloud services in the public and private  Cloud computing sector across the EU. Before publishing the strategy, the Commission has  conducted several desk research studies (Cloud uptake in the EU, standardization schemes for Cloud,  Cloud contracts and SLAs), which led them to define the following key actions, closely related to  information security and certification:   Standardisation and certification: ETSI is asked to produce a map of existing standards  relevant for Cloud computing. The Commission (COM) will work with ENISA to support  development of EU-wide voluntary schemes and to make a list of such schemes by 2014.   Cloud Contract Terms: The EC will develop model terms for Cloud SLAs as well as a set of  safe and fair contract terms for consumers and SMEs. The EC will also work with experts to  develop a code of conduct for Cloud providers regarding data protection, which will be  submitted to the Article 29 Working Party for endorsement.   European Cloud Partnership: The EC will set up a European Cloud Partnership, involving  industry and public sector, which will develop common procurement requirements adapted  to European needs.  As stated in the strategy “public authorities also stand to benefit from Cloud adoption both in terms  of efficiency savings and in terms of services that are more flexible and turned to the needs of  http://ec.europa.eu/digital-agenda/ http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=COM:2012:0529:FIN:EN:PDF http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=COM:2012:0529:FIN:EN:PDF http://ec.europa.eu/information_society/activities/cloudcomputing/docs/quantitative_estimates.pdf  Good Practice Guide for securely deploying Governmental Clouds  Page  2  citizens and business. [...] Cloud computing can help drive the transition to 21st century public  services that are interoperable, scalable and in line with the needs of a mobile population and  business that want to benefit from the European digital single market”. Cloud computing is the  driveway towards the realization of the “Every European Digital” dream, where bureaucracy will be  wiped out. In the strategy ENISA was asked to support the Commission in these activities.  Target audience  The target audiences of this report are:   Public bodies in the EU (local and regional public administrations, agencies, local healthcare  authorities, etc.) evaluating the costs and benefits for a public administration considering  using Cloud services;   European Union policymakers deciding on appropriate policy and economic incentives,  legislative measures, awareness-raising initiatives, etc., vis-à-vis Cloud-computing  technologies for governments and public administrations;   Cloud providers and Cloud VAS (value-added services – including security) providers trying to  achieve an early understanding of the needs and requirements of central governments,  public administrations and citizens, to be able to develop Cloud services that are in line with  these needs and requirements.  Methodology  This study and its outcome is based on desk research, an online survey and a set of interviews to  subject matter experts: experts working in governmental agencies implementing Cloud services or  being involved in the composition of the national Cloud strategy, experts from private sector who  provide services to the public sector supporting private Clouds etc.  The interviews and the research activities focussed on the following topics:   Governmental Cloud infrastructures that are currently operational, in the planning or in the  implementation phase;   Services (both “critical” and “non critical”1) currently deployed by the governmental sector  using Cloud technologies and/or services that will be migrated to the Cloud using Cloud  technologies;   National strategies across the EU that take into account the intent to foster Cloud computing  for governmental services;   Cloud computing projects and initiatives focusing on the dissemination and delivery of  governmental Cloud services;   Risk assessment and security frameworks for Cloud Computing and public services.  The interview templates and the questionnaire have been prepared according to the results from  the survey on the state of the art and specifically designed for Cloud providers, governmental IT  agencies, and public sector stakeholders. The questionnaires and the interviews covered quite a  broad number of topics:   Practices, orientations, expectations, initiatives, projects of the stakeholders in the  deployment of public services with the adoption of Cloud technologies.  1  Critical are those assets/services whose loss would lead to “severe economic or social consequences” i.e. water, energy,  transport, communications according to CPNI, UK:  https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/78902/section-a-natural-hazards- infrastructure.pdf  https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/78902/section-a-natural-hazards-infrastructure.pdf https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/78902/section-a-natural-hazards-infrastructure.pdf  Good Practice Guide for securely deploying Governmental Clouds  Page  3   Requirements, warranties, needs, expectations of the principal actors for enforcing security  of the governmental Cloud services, the assets and the data of public institutions.   Orientations, visions, views, positions on national Cloud computing strategies and on the  guidelines for security of governmental Cloud services.  As a result, we collected information from a total of  23 European countries (20 EU countries), and  specifically: Austria, Belgium, Cyprus, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy,  Malta, Republic of Moldova, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovenia, Slovakia,  Spain, Sweden, Turkey, UK.  Structure  In Chapter 2 of this document we present the characteristics of a governmental Cloud and its  definition; in Chapter 3 we give an overview of the Cloud uptake by the public sector in Europe  classifying the respective countries according to specific criteria; in Chapter 4 we provide best  practice examples, based on the several cases of governmental Clouds in Europe; and in Chapter 5  we present a set of recommendations and actions that can implement these recommendations on  securely deploying Cloud services in the public sector. We conclude in Chapter 6 with general  remarks on the future of governmental Cloud in the EU.  Good Practice Guide for securely deploying Governmental Clouds  Page  4  2 Governmental Cloud Computing  The goal of this chapter is to provide clarity on the definition and characteristics of governmental  Cloud computing. We provide a definition of governmental Cloud computing based on experts’  feedback and an outline of current core practices  classified in a specific taxonomy that will be used  throughout the complete document for a more in-depth analysis of best practices.  2.1 Towards a definition of Governmental Cloud computing (Gov-Cloud)  The definition of governmental Cloud should be based on the widely accepted definition of Cloud  computing by the National Institution of Standards and Technology (NIST) : Cloud computing is a  model for enabling convenient, on demand network access to a shared pool of configurable  computing resources (e.g. networks, servers, storage, applications and services) that can be  rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or service provider interaction.  2  Based on the NIST definition of Cloud Computing, below are the definitions of the different  deployment models:  Deployment Model Visualization  Public Clouds: Cloud  infrastructure and  computational resources are  made available to the general  public over public network.  Public Cloud Internet  Private Cloud (in house and  out sourced) : one customer  has the exclusive access and  usage of the infrastructure  and computational resources;  hosted on the organisations  premises (on-site) or  provided by a provider (out- sourced).  Private Cloud  Provider  Private Cloud  Enterprise Network  2  IaaS: Infrastructure as a Service, PaaS: Platform as a Service, SaaS: Software as a Service.  http://www.nist.gov/  Good Practice Guide for securely deploying Governmental Clouds  Page  5  Community Cloud (on-site  and outsourced): group of  users sharing the same  infrastructure and  computational resources. Can  be implemented in the  enterprise premise (on-site)  or deployed by a company  (out-sourced).  Private Cloud  Provider  Local Cloud  Enterprise Network  For governmental Cloud services, a standard definition is not yet adopted, and while there is no  common agreement on a definition for governmental Cloud, a common concept exists:   A gov-Cloud is an environment running services compliant with governmental and EU  legislations on security, privacy and resilience (what)   A gov-Cloud is a secure and trustworthy way (private Cloud or public Cloud) to run services  under public body governance (how)   A gov-Cloud is a deployment model to build and deliver services to state agencies (internal  delivery of services), to citizens and to enterprises (external delivery of services to society)  (for who)  Even though the above elements could help defining governmental Clouds, many implementations  of eGovernment services do not meet these characteristics. All these implementations are based on  virtualisation and web services technologies, and aim at consolidating resources to reduce the  number of governmental datacentres, usually meeting none of the above mentioned attributes.  A governmental Cloud is more than a centralised platform based on virtualisation technologies,  running eGovernment services and meeting the above-mentioned requirements. A gov-Cloud is  usually based on a sustainable governmental business model allowing standardizing services and  SLAs, to save cost, to help “smartening” the society. To achieve these goals, and more specifically to  be efficient from an economic perspective, the governmental Cloud should be a deployment model  providing basic services (e.g. authentication, storage, document management, workflow  management) that would be used by governmental agencies and ministries to build eGovernment  services for internal use, internal operation and management, and for services targeting at citizens  and private companies (society).  In the same light, one of the biggest benefits (beyond cost) of leveraging public/community Clouds is  the benefit of being much more agile and efficient, in terms of speed, processing power and  elasticity. The adoption of a governmental Cloud should be also a driver / an opportunity to re-think  the way ICT resources and eGovernment services are managed at government level, and to innovate  eGovernment services. Cloud computing offers a method of driving common standardisation and  then scale down commoditisation and hence costs.  Tailored solutions to tailored requirements cost  government departments significant overhead expenditure (and in many instances duplication – as  one department specifies a solution which another department has already bought). Cloud  computing uptake both depends and facilitates standardisation on features, technology and systems  and classification against clearly documented relevant standards and best practices. Standardisation  Good Practice Guide for securely deploying Governmental Clouds  Page  6  and reuse should take place both at the level of the ICT / Cloud infrastructures and processes but  also at the level of applications and services.  Cloud computing also introduces new risks. Generally for public organizationsadopting Cloud  computing, there is a risk of loosing control over how the service is being delivered. This is of great  interest when implementing Cloud in the public sector. Particularly for small organizations it may be  hard to negotiate the right contracts and SLAs to get the proper guarantees about the delivery of the  services; this can lead to lack of governance. There are also risks if (part of) the Cloud system is  running across borders, in other  jurisdictions. In these cases there may be risks for the  confidentiality of data, privacy of personal data, but also, it may complicate auditing, fraud  investigations, and services may become subject to foreign law enforcement or surveillance  activities.  Characteristics of a governmental Cloud  Summarising, a governmental Cloud is a Cloud computing system (an infrastructure, a platform and  a set of core services) which generally satisfies the following characteristics:  A.  The Cloud services are private (single tenancy), community (agreed set of tenants) or  public (multi tenancy) Cloud to host processes and/or store data, to run eGovernment  services and that can be controlled/monitored locally or in a centralised way by the public  body;  B.  It provides a set of “building blocks” reusable services to create eGovernment services  for public administration, citizens and private companies;  C.  It can be owned and managed by central government and/or external providers/ bodies.  The central government or local bodies have the end responsibility (private or community  deployment model);  D.  There is a business model that allows operating the infrastructure, the platform and the  services and in a way guaranteeing efficiency and economy of scale;  E.  The infrastructure, the platform and the services are compliant with country  governments and EU legislations on privacy, security and resiliency (location of the Gov- Cloud: on premises or off premises Cloud).  2.2 Current core practices  To understand the practices on governmental Cloud we investigated how governmental Cloud  services are deployed (deployment models), what service models are adopted (service models), what  type of services are provided (type of gov-Cloud services), how the governmental Cloud and services  are managed (management framework), whether the adoption of Cloud computing will innovate  eGovernment services and what are the benefits of adopting Cloud computing.  Good Practice Guide for securely deploying Governmental Clouds  Page  7  Figure 1 already implemented deployment models for governmental Cloud  The preferred deployment models (Public Cloud, Private Cloud or Community Cloud) implemented  or planned to be implemented depicted in Figure 1. Figure 2 shows the most popular services  models.  Figure 2 Service models for governmental Cloud  For the identification of the type of government services, the services have been classified as  “critical” when they handle sensitive information or when the impact of a failure affects a number of  citizens/ countries  and as “non critical” when the services utilize low-sensitive information and the  requirements in terms of security are quite loose.  The services are categorised as “Government to Government”, when a public institution provides  Cloud services to others public institutions; “Government to Citizen”, when a public institution  provides services to citizens (this option includes the “Government to Private”, where the end users  are private companies) with a Cloud-based technology; “Government internal”, when the services  are for the internal ICT services of the public organisation. Survey results are reported in Figure 3.  Good Practice Guide for securely deploying Governmental Clouds  Page  8  Figure 3 Categorization of government services by criticality and target users  Another aspect examined in this report is the management framework adopted by the public  institutions for the governmental Cloud. The management framework options are “Government - Private”, when the public institutions buy the Cloud services from a private Cloud provider and/or  the public institutions are assisted in the operations, in the set-up and in the management of the  Cloud infrastructures with the help of private technology providers; “Government - Government”,  when the public institutions buy the Cloud services from another public institutions which have the  role of Cloud provider and/or the public institutions have in-house capabilities and know-how for the  overall management of the technological Cloud infrastructures. Survey results are reported in Figure  4.  Figure 4 Management framework for governmental Cloud  Good Practice Guide for securely deploying Governmental Clouds  Page  9  3 Classification of governmental Clouds across the EU  To be able to present the wide and heterogeneous landscape of the EU countries concerning  governmental Cloud a classification is needed. The basic criteria for this classification are as follows:   the existence of a policy background to support the implementation of Cloud computing in  administrative systems, i.e. national Cloud strategy or digital agenda,   and the phase of the governmental Cloud implementation (design, implementation, projects  running etc).  In the following we describe the main characteristics of each group we have identified.   Early adopters: the countries in this group are: The United Kingdom, Spain and France. They  have a Cloud strategy and they have taken specific decisions on how to implement the  governmental Cloud. A number of initiatives is already running based on Cloud solutions.   Well - Informed: the countries in this group are: The Netherlands, Germany, Republic of  Moldova, Norway, Ireland, Finland, Slovak republic, Belgium, Greece, Sweden and  Denmark. They have a strategy but the implementation is still at design or prototype stage  or they have only  preliminary implementations of some governmental Cloud services. In all  cases, they are planning to massively adopt the governmental Cloud in the future, after an  in-depth evaluation and investigation of the risks and the benefits of the Cloud solutions  they have identified for the implementation and after the analysis of the first results of the  implemented Cloud services.   Innovators :  the countries in this  group are: Italy, Austria, Slovenia, Portugal and Turkey.  The “Innovators” do not have a high-level Cloud strategy with clear indications on the  solutions for the governmental Cloud, they could have a digital agenda that considers the  adoption of Cloud computing, but they already have some Cloud-based services running,  mainly based on bottom-up initiatives. Cloud implementation is forthcoming, but will need  to be supported by a national or European high-level regulation.   Hesitants: the countries in this group are: Malta, Romania, Cyprus, and Poland. This group  is composed by countries that do not have a governmental Cloud strategy in place, they  could have a digital agenda that considers the adoption of Cloud computing but do not have  relevant Cloud initiatives or governmental Cloud experiences. They are planning to  implement governmental Cloud in the future mainly to boost the country business and  competitiveness and to attract investments.  These categories are not exhaustive, but are useful in describing the wide and heterogeneous  landscape of the EU countries. Table 1 summarizes the categories by dimension of analysis.  Good Practice Guide for securely deploying Governmental Clouds  Page  10  Early adopters Well Informed Innovators Hesitants  Political and  legal aspects  (Cloud strategy)  Cloud strategy  exists  On-going  implementation of a  Cloud strategy  Mainly limited to  the Innovation and  the digitalisation of  the public  administration  No Cloud  strategy exists  Status  (Governmental  Cloud)  Mainly  implemented  governmental  Cloud or  supporting  initiatives  The gov-Cloud is not  fully developed (in  most cases at  design/prototype  stage)  Gov-Cloud  solutions exists,  but very  jeopardised and  not integrated into  a high level  national vision  No gov-Cloud  exists  Type of Cloud  implementation  Private Cloud  (except UK where  is public Cloud)  Private Cloud  (except Sweden  where is community  Cloud)  Public/Private  Cloud  NA  Motivation for  adopting Cloud  Innovation,  Competitiveness,  efficiency, job  growth  Efficiency and cost  saving, flexibility  Harmonisation of  ICT, innovation in  the public  administration  Competitiveness  and attraction  of investments  Table 1 Categories outlined by dimensions  3.1 The “Early adopters”  The main countries composing the “Early adopters” group are: United Kingdom, Spain and France.  The “early adopters” have published a Cloud strategy and its implementation actions. Usually, they  have a number of Cloud initiatives running. In general, the ICT level of adoption in this case is very  high and quite widespread. At national level there have been a number of investments on initiatives  and activities in the area of Cloud computing funded by the government (for both private – e.g.  SMEs – and public organisations). The overall design approach in defining and implementing public  (multi-tenant) Cloud solutions is very pragmatic.  Policies, strategies and drivers  The key element of this group is the adoption of a Cloud implementation plan at national level, in  some cases with a Cloud strategy (documents, frameworks, guidelines, regulations, implementation  plans), or through a smooth migration of public services in Cloud solutions. We have encountered  differences in the maturity of the solution and in the specific characteristics of the governmental  Clouds; however, in all cases the adoption is quite widespread in administrative (various  governmental bodies involved), geographically categorized (local, national, or regional bodies) and  technical level (Cloud solutions have been adopted for a quite wide range of services - not only non- critical ones).  The most important dimension is the role played by the policy makers in preparing, developing and  driving a high-level Cloud strategy for the country in all cases with a very pragmatic way. The  definition of a Cloud strategy has been established inside a wider plan focused on a) innovation in  Good Practice Guide for securely deploying Governmental Clouds  Page  11  the public administration and efficiency in ICT, or as part of a strategy to b) support employment and  growth.  Alongside the specific strategies and Cloud related initiatives, all these countries have invested time  in supporting SMEs and research centres that have been funded with a number of projects and  initiatives related to Cloud computing, building this way steady ground for the development of Cloud  computing nationally.  Governmental Cloud practices  The governmental Cloud practices have been developed and launched by the central governmental  authorities (in particular Ministries or other governmental bodies). The projects are often linked to  other public activities or are specific initiative part of larger policies; for example, in Spain, e-invoice  services using SaaS with the SARA infrastructure.

These  countries have a “live-document”  for Cloud strategy or digital agenda, but the implementation is  mostly still at the design or prototype stage, or they have partially implemented governmental Cloud  services. Cloud computing is considered as a technical solution suitable for governmental IT services,  but mainly in the form of “private Cloud” for reasons related to privacy concerns and/or due to the  lack of compliance of the solutions of the providers to the governmental security requirements.  Currently these countries are assessing how to implement Cloud in the best way and according to  their specific needs; or have already started implementing Cloud services as a pilot, and need to  evaluate the results before fully extending Cloud services. They might have Cloud-based services not  fully running but in a development/implementation phase, Cloud based solutions only for limited  services, or only for the use of single body (e.g. public agencies in the Netherlands using SaaS  solutions, in Germany, “the technology program Trusted Cloud is the central contribution of the  BMWi (Federal Ministry of Economics and Technology) for Cloud computing program, which was  launched in cooperation with partners from industry and academia in October 2010. It is part of the  ICT strategy \"Digital Germany 2015\" and the \"High-Tech Strategy\" of the federal government). In  other cases “Cloud-like” solutions might be already in place (e.g. virtualisations of public datacentres  storage solutions in the Netherlands). The implementation is designed carefully; a number of studies  (market research, exchange with other countries, R&D preparatory work, etc.) are realised or  http://trusted-cloud.de/  Good Practice Guide for securely deploying Governmental Clouds  Page  13  planned to support Cloud deployment and to ensure the adoption of the best possible Cloud  solution. Other European countries could provide guidelines - based on previous experience.  Policies, strategies and drivers  In these countries the adoption of Cloud computing by governmental organisations is quite limited  or (in some cases) almost absent. However there is a very strong political willingness to promote and  widen the adoption of Cloud in public bodies. Within this group, the policy makers and  governmental bodies (e.g. Ministries) are indeed confident about the benefits and opportunities that  Cloud solutions can offer, specifically for the public bodies. However, all the potential constraints  and defaults are carefully considered and currently under investigation and – as a result - for most of  these countries, the political will is to go for the adoption of a “private Cloud” solution.  These countries have realised (or are willing to realise) an in-depth and extensive preparatory phase  before deciding what kind of Cloud solutions will be more suitable for the governmental bodies  organisations. Within this preparatory work, a number of market studies, evaluation of technological  solutions, definition of the specific requirements for governmental Cloud, have been realised in  order to sensibly assess all the aspects related to the adoption and migration towards the Cloud.  Governmental Cloud practices  In the “Well Informed” group, governmental Cloud computing experiences are quite limited or very  recent. However, it has been possible to outline the main characteristics of the current solutions as  well as the ones of the future solutions that these countries are willing to implement.  More general information on the status of the projects and details on the service models are  presented below.  Status Application and Services  Finland No adoption of actual “governmental Cloud”.

So  use common analysis tools, e.g. to  improve their market research and  better customize products (MIA).  The  Netherlands4  In 2011 Dutch government presented its  Cloud Strategy. The Central Government  identifies two main problems inhibiting the  implementation of Cloud computing:  the  relative immaturity of the Cloud computing  market, and the government’s highly stringent  requirements with respect to data protection  and privacy.  Initially, therefore, Cloud computing will only  be implemented internally, within the Central  Government itself. That is to say, no use will  be made of ‘open’ Cloud computing, but  rather a ‘closed’ Cloud will be set up under  Central Government’s management and  control. The Cloud will exist within Central  Government’s own secure network and be  managed by its Central Government’s own IT  staff.  As of June 2013, the Goal Architecture of the  Closed Governmental Cloud has been  approved.  Small projects have been realised at  local level, by the municipalities by  creating an autonomous and  independent datacentres.  SaaS solutions are used by agencies  responsible for different type of  policies, often for storing open data  in the Cloud  The Dutch agency responsible for  providing license plates for cars is  using the Cloud platform for its  open data.  Norway In the “Digital Agenda for Norway” published  in 2012-2013, the Norwegian State included  the Cloud Computing as one of the main key  topics.

Ireland In 2012, the Irish Government developed the  Government Cloud Computing Strategy for  the public service, which places Cloud  computing in the heart of future government  ICT strategy: providing an approach for the  public service deploy Cloud Computing and to  undertake a comprehensive program of  Datacentre Consolidation.  Examples of Cloud initiatives: Cloud  services for research application is  the EduStorage, a new network  Cloud data storage service  deployed by HEAnet (Ireland’s  National Education and Research  Network) providing advanced  Internet and associated ICT and e- Infrastructure services to  Educational and Research  organizations.  Slovakia The Slovak Republic has already prepared the  Strategic Document for Digital Growth and  Next Generation Access Infrastructure for the  2014-2020 periods. One of the strategic  objectives and priorities, to be accomplished  by 2020, proposed under the strategic  document is for the Slovak Republic to  introduce a common Cloud platform to share  public administration services and  information.  A project entitled “Datacentre for  Towns and Municipalities” is now at  its implementation stage, with its  target outcome being Cloud  platform based electronic services  for local government authorities.  Denmark There are few experiences of governmental  Cloud. At high level, an e-governmental  strategy has been produced for the 2011-2015  period.

However, it is not an obstacle that  halts the adoption of Cloud computing by the government; handling of security and privacy issues  could be simpler than expected, once a trustworthy relation is established with the Cloud providers.  The on-going activity focusses on how to concretely manage the relationship with the Cloud  provider, and which are the clauses the Cloud providers could fulfil. Specification of needed  certifications, SLAs, audits, security and privacy requirements are currently under investigation as  well. The fact that security requirements are not fully met by the provider is also a drawback.  Good Practice Guide for securely deploying Governmental Clouds  Page  18  Due diligence is also another drawback in this case. In particular, the issue of sharing responsibilities  among the private providers, the agencies or a public third party (if there), and the government is  very critical.  3.3 The “Innovators”  The main countries composing the “Innovators” group are: Italy, Austria, Slovenia, Turkey and  Portugal. The “Innovators” do not have a high-level Cloud strategy (they could have a digital agenda  that considers the adoption of Cloud computing) but they already have some initiatives/services  running at local level or in specific sectors (e.g. e-Health); these existing initiatives are covering  mainly (but not only) non-critical services. For most countries there is a willingness to design and  implement a public Cloud in short term (1-2 years). The adoption of Cloud is mainly due to a bottom- up approach in the building and stimulating Cloud uptake. The industry, service providers, local  agencies, SMEs play a very active role by promoting their Cloud solutions or pushing for the adoption  of innovative IT service in the public.  Several private organisations are responsible for implementing and maintaining the public Cloud  services and infrastructures, with the effect of having a number of not well harmonised services,  applications and general IT solutions that have very limited level of interoperability.  In fact there is also a fragmented and not heterogeneous environment with regards to the  applications, services, contracts and SLAs with multiple Cloud providers. However, a number of  outstanding initiatives exists (mainly started by public administrators at middle management level or  regional levels) showing a very good level of novelty and value in the adoption of governmental  Cloud services. Nonetheless, these initiatives still remain isolated, and are not integrated into a  strategic vision or at political or high-level public administration.  The issues of security and privacy in relation to the Cloud computing for the governmental bodies  have not been well addressed; in some cases such regulation is perceived either as too tight, or is  not focused on the specific needs and issues of Cloud computing for governmental institutions, or is  completely lacking. These countries look at Europe as the main actor that should start up a  “European Cloud legal framework” and drive the harmonisation of the different regulations across  the EU; specifically (and at least) Europe should push for making the governmental Cloud as a main  topic to be covered by each national ICT strategy.  Policies, strategies and drivers  The “Innovators” do not have an official governmental Cloud strategy in place, but do have policies,  frameworks, programmes, and initiatives that mainly deal with the digitalisation and innovation in  the governmental bodies and public administration. In general these countries have a variety of  public administration bodies, agencies and third parties (both at local and central level) operating  as/with/and-on-behalf of the governmental body; in some cases they also deal with the deployment  and provisioning of IT services.  In comparison to the “well informed” that are willing to adopt the Cloud but with a more long-term  schedule (3-4 years) and that already are in the phase of studying and investigating of governmental  Cloud solutions, the “Innovators” are less “long-suffering” and would like to move to the  governmental Cloud quite quickly and effectively. Assessment studies and research should be done  by a single high-level public central entity but realised in a concrete manner by each body that is  willing to move to the Cloud. From this point of view, this cluster group is very keen on having high- level guidelines in the form of regulations and legal frameworks: “practical” suggestions on how to  select, move, implement, and maintain the governmental Clouds are not perceived as relevant. It  Good Practice Guide for securely deploying Governmental Clouds  Page  19  seems that the practical implementation should be done on-the-field and to be realised by each  body itself, but of course under a Cloud strategy.  So far, there is no specific plan on the deployment type of service the governmental body should  have. In some specific cases (e.g. Austria5) the adoption of a governmental Cloud is perceived as  unfeasible at the moment due to the lack of Cloud quality criteria and certifications schemes that  would increase transparency concerning the security of public Cloud services.  Governmental Cloud practices  Despite the lack of an overall Cloud strategy and high-level vision, governmental Cloud projects are  taking place, with some peaks of excellence. The adoption of Cloud is mainly due to a bottom-up  approach (realised mainly by the middle management and the operational personnel of the public  administration or in regional cases) and is building and stimulating the Cloud uptake. In most cases  drivers of these initiatives are mainly the push for competiveness and innovations rather than the  cost-saving benefits that Cloud claims to provide. As well as for the IT adoption, also for the Cloud  most cases are running in specific sectors (e.g. e-Health) or in specific organisations (e.g. local  bodies).  To by-pass the “no-Cloud-vision” approach, some large governmental institutions have started  themselves a process toward the implementation of Cloud infrastructure owned by them, to deploy  Cloud services for internal purposes as well as for other public bodies. In this scenario, the  governmental body is not only the final user, but also becomes a Cloud provider for other public/no  public users.  As an example of good Cloud practices, large governmental institutions have started a process of  evaluation of the technological infrastructures providing Cloud services to the local municipalities  under their administration and jurisdiction. This implementation model has been perceived in a  positive way, as municipalities are reassured from the issue of controlling and managing data, which  are actually managed by a public institution.  The “innovators” look at Europe as the main actor that should start up a “European Cloud legal/  policy framework” and drive the harmonisation of the different regulations across the EU;  specifically Europe should push for making the “governmental Cloud” a main topic to be covered by  each national regulation. This framework could suggest guidelines on how to setup a Cloud strategy,  guidelines on public procurement with solutions on the locality of data and governance issues.

The Department of Treasury of the Minister of Economy  and Finance has a Cloud platform providing services that  can be used internally and by other public  administrations.  The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has developed a private  Cloud to ensure service continuity for Italians residing  abroad by strengthening active and passive security as  well as ICT safety of diplomatic-consular offices located  in areas of high conflict.  The Region of Tuscany has inaugurated the new Cloud  datacenter for providing services to the local  municipalities. At the beginning IaaS and PaaS, in the  next SaaS.

Moreover,  the high-level legal framework is absent that should be the reference point when adopting Cloud for  governmental bodies. The need for specific regulation designed to support, promote, and fund  activities aiming at widespread of the governmental Cloud adoption is evident.  In this case, the need for national regulation (or at least guidelines), as a starting point, is considered  a catalyst to create efficiency and innovation in the governmental services and the public  administration itself, therefore spreading the innovation to all the country. In particular the adoption  of governmental Cloud, if realised under a high-level policy design, could harmonise the “plethora of  public administration IT services”, centralise and optimise resources (both tangible and non-tangible  ones), and offer an engine for competitiveness of national Cloud providers. Policy level guidelines  Good Practice Guide for securely deploying Governmental Clouds  Page  22  should be given in order to have a specific regulation for the adoption of Cloud for the governmental  bodies.  With regards to the security and privacy issues, it is perceived that addressing these requirements  will greatly increase the cost of the Cloud-based service and will also make SLAs quite complex from  the point of view of the governmental bodies (considering both the preparation of the contracts and  the actual verification during deployment). The current security and privacy regulations are  perceived to be in some cases obsolete and do not take into account the specific characteristics  (such as locality of data, governance models, offering no flexibility to the Cloud user) of Cloud  computing for governmental bodies. Therefore, the full adoption of Cloud technologies will need to  be supported by the development of an overall legal framework specifically designed for the IT for  the governmental services. The new legal framework should take into account not only technical and  commercial issues but mainly organisational ones, including the interrelation of the services  between different governmental organisations (small/large, local/central) as well as the security  governance issues. Risks such as lack of governance or cross border compliance should be dealt with  in the framework, to avoid confusion when carrying out law enforcement and to prevent  unauthorised state surveillance activities.  3.4 The “Hesitants”  The main countries composing the “Hesitants” group are: Malta, Romania, Cyprus and Poland. They  neither have a high level strategy, nor specific planning for future implementation. In most cases this  is more due to the limited resources available rather than to the lack of IT innovation. Despite the  fact that no specific policies or strategies are in place, the absence of a Cloud strategy does not  indicate that Cloud computing is perceived as an unsuitable technology for governmental IT services;  in fact in these countries there is a widespread positive attitude towards the adoption of Cloud  computing in the future.  The intention of adopting Cloud in the long term (3-4 years) exists. In parallel there is a quite diffuse  awareness (in particular from the operators providing support, R&D, and consultancy IT services to  the public administration) on the benefits of adopting Cloud, as well as the potential risks and costs  for the deployment of Cloud services. The will to implement Cloud is mainly linked to the benefits  that it could provide to the country's business activities and for attracting investments (rather than  being a benefit mainly for the governmental body itself and for the citizens). In most cases these  countries also claim that the start-up of Cloud adoption is delayed due to the lack of a European  regulation on the topic of governmental Cloud, as well as the exchange of best practices and lesson  learnt from other European countries.  National legislation or agreements between government and  vendors does not suffice due to lack of trust, transparency and new investment costs.

Good Practice Guide for securely deploying Governmental Clouds  Page  24  4 Best practice scenarios and analysis  In this chapter we present three scenarios, based on the three first categories described above. A  SWOT analysis per scenario is conducted at the end of each scenario. The scenarios are based on the  actual situation in Europe, as presented in chapter 2 and 3, with some additional elements.  4.1 A Governmental Cloud Catalogue  Having adopted a national Cloud strategy, a European country “Greenshore” seeking to support  governmental bodies in the smooth adoption of Cloud solutions, sets up a governmental Cloud  catalogue to be used by governmental bodies. In the catalogue, each provider (big providers or  SMEs) can offer their product: the types of Cloud services provided are IaaS, PaaS and SaaS with a  large range of categories of services i.e. email, storage, website, CRMs, collaboration applications  etc. The implementation model is public Cloud, meaning that the Cloud resources of the providers  are shared and used by multiple customers. Each provider listed the catalogue has its own  infrastructure to support the services offered. The idea behind this national project is that  government will eliminate all the drawbacks that were keeping the governmental bodies from going  into the Cloud.  In essence, what this catalogue (implemented by public sector) offers is an intermediary solution for  contract enforcement and security accreditation, held by a governmental organization.  Before  procuring a service, a risk assessment by public agencies is taking place; they analyse the Cloud- based solutions and verify if the candidate services meet the specific requirements (including  security and privacy issues). The providers joining this catalogue should be compliant to a baseline  set of security requirements; the requirements will include measures categorized in different risk- impact maturity levels. A specific procedure is in place for this task and when it is complete the  service is accredited and can be used by governmental agencies.  This catalogue is open for providers based in Greenshore, reassuring that the datacentres are in  Greenshore and falling no other jurisdiction but Greenshore’s. If a foreign provider would like to  offer services, additional security requirements must be met and adopt the contractual clauses on  data protection. To allow more SMEs to participate in this project, the accreditation process is free  of charge and obligatory to all potential providers. In the offered services list, it is signified if the  service is accredited or not. This way the buyers know which service is suitable or not for handling  sensitive or personal data. The pre-assurance is not only helping SMEs but everybody in stream- lining the process, cutting costs, standardising and re-using without the need to engage in re- assurance.  All providers of services or applications in the catalogue need to be pre-assured as do the  service assembly workloads and the deployment and life-cycle management processes of the  government catalogue.  Below we conduct a SWOT analysis for the scenario described above.  Strength  Security guarantees. The security accreditation is  guaranteed (by the governmental authority that will  perform this task) with an efficient cost effective  process, which permits both to offer secure Cloud  services and simple Cloud services for low-level of  criticality type of ICT services.  Weakness  Slow diffusion of Cloud. The public  institutions are not obliged to select Cloud- based solutions for the ICT services. The  real uptake of the Cloud in the public  sector could be uncertain  Change in the ICT culture and approach  Good Practice Guide for securely deploying Governmental Clouds  Page  25  Central consolidation of know-how on security for  Cloud based services which is enriched and updated  continuously with the advances in the regulations and  the progress in the security frameworks  from the public sector. A cultural change is  required for the adoption of Cloud services  Dissemination of Cloud services used by  governmental institutions: Diversification  of services could lead to interoperability  and portability issues  Opportunities  ICT innovation in the public sector and potential  increase of competitiveness in the private sectors  (SMEs and big companies)  Efficiency by eliminating the duplication of effort for  cost-effective procurement and security verification of  information systems/services  Ensure the adequate level of security for gov-Cloud  services  Threats  Scalability. The centrally managed security  and procurement requires an appropriate  department/structure that will not create  “bottle-neck” for the services  accreditations  Complexity of the start-up. The set-up of  processes, integration, and governance  needs a strong initial effort  Table 8 SWOT analysis of the “Early adopters” use case scenario  4.2 Consolidating Existing Clouds to Improve Efficiency  In the country of “Fairlyn”, it can be said that the use of Cloud computing dates back to before the  term Cloud computing was even coined. Municipalities, counties and regions have been using shared  computing resources and infrastructure already for a long time, to run applications and databases  supporting processes such as population registers, issuance of identity documents, registration of  vehicles, or budget planning and management.  The cornerstone of this structure is based on the fact that the corresponding administrative bodies  founded ICT service providers, wholly owned by them (ICT service provider is part of administrative  bodies). These service providers were tasked with setting up and running datacentres in the  corresponding administrative regions, hosting the applications used to support most of the  administrative processes of the participants, and in many cases also managing the networks  connecting the users to the datacentres. The owners of the ICT services are the different  governmental institutions.  Recently, many of these IT service providers have been introducing new services explicitly branded  as “Cloud” services.  This model has allowed the participating administrative bodies to benefit from significant economies  of scale. It can be seen as a good example of the “community Cloud” model (used by a closed group  of independent entities).  The approach predates the development of the Cloud computing concept itself and also Fairlyn’s  Digital Agenda, and therefore didn’t follow a defined strategy initially. However, exchange of  Good Practice Guide for securely deploying Governmental Clouds  Page  26  information about good practices and lessons learned both among the participating administrations  (i.e. the customer side) and the different regional service providers (i.e. the provider side) has led to  a surprisingly homogeneous picture.  In its recently finalised Digital Agenda, the government of Fairlyn recognises the potential offered by  this successful model, and aims to build on the experience gathered in the past. Fairlyn’s Digital  Agenda calls for increased standardisation of IT environments across several levels of public  administration, and for increased cooperation between the different regional datacentres, to further  improve the economies of scale, and to enable new operation modes increasing the resilience of the  services.  Strength  Strategic vision for the development of a  government-wide “i-infrastructure”. The  strategy will aim at realizing a “closed” Cloud  infrastructure under the Central Government’s  management and ownership, as unique ICT  infrastructure for the public sector  Clear “step-by-step” plan for introduction of  secure Cloud services. The Cloud strategy is  particularly focused on implementing a gradual  introduction of Cloud technologies in the public  sector, with intermediate steps for the analysis  of the results and decision for the further  progress of diffusion of Cloud services  Accurate preliminary analysis of the Cloud  computing risks and benefits. A set of research  studies for the deep understanding of the Cloud  computing risks and benefits has been  conducted, covering the aspects about security  and data privacy issues and the compliance of  the Cloud technologies.  Weakness  Unclear definition of the governance. The  unclear definition of the governance model for  the initiative could be revealed as a problem that  will occur during the working phase and that  could be an obstacle  Governmental public Cloud services  requirements are not addressed. Even if the  offers from the Cloud providers evaluated are still  immature, the strategy does not include any  specific positions on the type of governmental  Cloud services implementations.  Cost effectiveness issues. The development of  own datacentres will be cost prohibitive for most  countries.  Opportunities  ICT modernization of the IT infrastructures for  the public sector  Efficiency by preventing the redundant and  similar applications and services within the  public agencies and institutions  Consolidation of the multiple Fairlyn’s  governmental datacentres into a single “i- infrastructure”  Threats  Not effective achievement of the final objective  of the Cloud strategy. The public institutions are  not obliged to select Cloud-based solutions for  the ICT services. The development of own  datacentres in parallel with the closed Cloud  infrastructure could be go on with the effects of  the slowing the diffusion of closed Cloud and to  not achieve the overall objectives of the Cloud  strategy  Good Practice Guide for securely deploying Governmental Clouds  Page  27  Concerns about security and privacy issues for  high-sensitive information. Feedback from some  public agencies not to use Cloud infrastructure  for high sensitivity data could become  problematic.  Table 9 SWOT analysis of the “Well Informed” scenario  4.3 Building a National Cloud Infrastructure Based on Open Source  In this country, “Atlandia”, there is no Cloud strategy; the government doesn’t consider Cloud  adoption as a priority. However the external commercial providers’ community is very active in this  domain; a national initiative was launched to support universities, research centres and other public  academic institutions in building the “Academic Cloud”. A local network provider (networks and  public infrastructures, not telecommunications), contracted by the government, with the assistance  of other small providers (SMEs consortium) built a Cloud platform where students can enrol for free,  create a virtual machine, connect to virtual networks and the Internet and gain process to all the  academic books shared in the country. The vision behind this is to offer scalability, a service open to  everyone, no customer lock-in (by the vendor) and low admin costs making it accessible to small  admin teams.  The provider offers a public IaaS solution, with datacentres located in Atlandia (and under the data  protection law of Atlandia, compliant with the EU data protection law) offering storage solutions,  with all stacks being built using open source software. Other members of the consortium offer back  up services to the main datacentre. According to the requirements of the customer the service can  be updated to provide flexibility. Data storage and processing procedures are compliant with  national data law.  In IaaS security is a non-trivial matter; it is considered a feature covered by the provider via security  measures i.e. firewall services. When building the virtual machine, use of encryption methods is  suggested. It is very important that security is integrated at the lowest level; one can have very  secure platforms and software, but the “construction” will collapse if the underlying infrastructure is  compromised.  Plans for the future are mainly for SaaS: email, document management, office  automation service used by the government and public bodies will be moved to Cloud.  Below we conduct a SWOT analysis for the scenario described above.  Strength  Strategic relevance of Cloud computing for the public  sector. Cloud computing is considered strategic for  the public sector because this service can be used by  governmental bodies. This example can be a model  for when considering implementation in the  administrative systems.  Security is considered as an important aspect of the  IaaS. Often, local laws and regulations prevent the use  Weakness  Needs of high-level guidelines. The lack of  high-level guidelines covering technical,  legal and organisational issues is a major  concern i.e. procurement guidelines for  securely procure services for the citizens,  contractual recommendations for public  sector.  Good Practice Guide for securely deploying Governmental Clouds  Page  28  of IaaS providers that will store data outside the  country borders because of stringent security  requirements of Government. So security is very  important for IaaS providers. Projects and initiatives  of governmental Cloud infrastructures have started  with a bottom-up approach and security is part of all  layers.  Lack of open source software support.  Service level for supporting open source  software may not correspond to  expectations (maintenance, patching,  updating etc).  Opportunities  The governmental agencies will adopt a Cloud-based  paradigm in IaaS. The project can make more simple  and faster the process of integration on the  governmental Cloud for the public institutions.  Threats  Cloud services from private Cloud  providers are not addressed at all. The  high-level guidelines should include  recommendations for services of private  Cloud providers.  Security and privacy aspects to be  addressed in case of extending to PaaS/  SaaS.  Before making the services available  to governmental bodies, all security aspects  should be addressed. The provider should  find a way to guarantee baseline security  measures compliance.  Table 10 SWOT analysis of the “Innovators” scenario  Good Practice Guide for securely deploying Governmental Clouds  Page  29  5 Recommendations  Based on the current situation in Europe concerning the adoption of Cloud computing and the  derived scenarios, we present a set of recommendations on how to securely deploy governmental  Clouds. A description of the recommendations follows as well as the actions that need to be taken to  fulfil them:   EC and MS to support the development of an EU strategy to foster the adoption of  governmental Cloud;   EC and MS to develop a business model to guarantee the sustainability and economies of  scale or governmental Cloud solutions;   MS and Cloud providers to foster the development of a framework to mitigate the “loss of  control” issue;   EC and MS to promote the definition of a regulatory framework to address the “locality  problem”;   MS and Cloud providers to encourage the development of governmental Cloud solutions  compliant with EU and country specific regulation;   EC and MS to support the development of an SLA framework;   EC and MS to foster the adoption of baseline security measures for both public and private  Cloud deployment models;   EC and MS to develop a certification framework;   Academia and Cloud providers to foster research on governmental Cloud security;   EC and MS to support  privacy enhancement in the Cloud.

This  slow take-up is due to many issues described above related to security, loss of control, data  protection and awareness. Although existing or proposed security legislative pieces cover some of  the security aspects, the use of Cloud computing has a significant impact in differentiating how IT  and services operate and their adoption will have to lead to a revision of such security measures  Our study reveals that the adoption of gov-Cloud in a systemic way is more advanced in countries  that already have a national strategy addressing the Cloud computing adoption. Moreover, many  experts are convinced that the development of an EU strategy focussing only on public sector and  national strategies for governmental Cloud computing will foster the adoption of gov-Cloud in the  EU countries.  Actions  Some recommendations based on our findings:  1. To elaborate and design a strategy with high-level guidelines, covering technical, legal and  organisational issues. The clear definition of the governance model for the Cloud initiative  should be defined before the implementation phase. A coherent plan presenting the  objectives and the vision of the governmental bodies, the agile dissemination of Cloud  services within several public institutions, and if a centrally designed strategy is defined, is  needed. The lack of strategy and the deficiency on technical, legal and procedural aspects  are critical obstacles for the start-up of governmental Cloud services.  2. To consider a program that can envisage the incremental introduction of secure Cloud  services, with a step-by-step execution plan and with meaningful deliverables and  milestones. A \"step-by-step\" plan would be an option for gradually introducing the Cloud in  the public sectors, by taking more confidence to the technologies during a soft transition  period, and thus permitting the public institutions to assimilate the new way of managing  and deploying IT services and core processes for IT operations.  3. To promote well-informed, risk-based policies that will encourage and stimulate the start-up  of Cloud in the public sectors and encourage use of external public Cloud solutions for the  “open data”. The policies should facilitate the ability of governmental bodies to choose  Cloud computing for their services. “Cloud first policy” that is currently adopted in UK,  Netherlands, the Republic of Moldova and the US FedRAMP program could support growth  in Cloud computing. The “Cloud first policy” recommends the public sector organisations to  consider and evaluate potential Cloud solutions first – before making any new investments  for new services.  4. To relate the national Cloud strategy with projects and initiatives for increasing the  government ICT efficiency and datacentre simplification. Initiatives for datacentre  consolidation and/or ICT portfolio assessment can become important drivers to boosting the  Cloud computing strategy; at the same time, Cloud computing can accelerate datacentre  consolidation efforts and ICT portfolio simplification by reducing the number of applications  hosted within government datacentre.  5. To evaluate the option of the public Cloud deployment model. Public Cloud is a more viable  option for the public sector for leveraging some of the main benefits of Cloud computing  paradigm, if security issues and concerns are addressed. In a strategy for the Cloud  computing with step-by-step execution planning, the public Clouds could be deployed for  non-critical services or in a second phase of the implementation of the strategy.  6. The MSs need to ensure the strategy’s compliance with laws, regulations, and national  agency requirements for the security and data protection.  The MS should also make sure  Good Practice Guide for securely deploying Governmental Clouds  Page  32  that the national strategy is be compliant to national and EU laws and regulations on  security and protection of information, assets, and infrastructures and taking into account  the privacy of data. We encourage that the EC adopts one European set of rules and  regulations concerning security and privacy, to support MS in this action.  7. To evaluate options for developing government service catalogues encompassing pre- assured Cloud products / applications and services catalogues, which are further classified  against targeted government Cloud platforms, usage profiles and best-practices  5.2 Recommendation 2: a business model to guarantee sustainability  Today, the private Cloud model (governance and use in the governmental institution) is the most  widely used in EU governmental Clouds (as indicated by the 57% of the experts interviewed). The  slow take-up of the public Cloud model found roots in regulatory weaknesses and immaturity of  public Cloud solutions. The relative immaturity of the Cloud computing market creates three  significant difficulties:  1. Although there are plenty of providers of Cloud computing services, most are start-ups, and  therefore cannot guarantee the level of stability that a company partnering with the  government would need to have.  2. Most solutions have so far been designed for the business context. As a result, few open  Cloud solutions on the market can meet the specific requirements of government.  3. Few solutions on the market today take account of the government’s special responsibility  for data protection. As a result, there are still relatively few open Cloud computing solutions  on the market that would be suitable for use by the Central Government.  However, to build and operate a private Cloud, migrating existing services could be really expensive  and the development of cost model capable to evaluate the real cost saving is actually a difficult  task. To really boost the adoption of governmental Cloud, EC and MS competent authorities, in  cooperation with Cloud providers, should develop a business model that will guarantee the  efficiency and the economy of scale of the governmental Cloud solutions. The solution is to move  towards the use of an appropriate public/community Cloud business model. This model will reduce  costs to improve data and service availability, service reliability and security.  Actions  A pan European regulatory framework is needed to enable the adoption of multi-tenancy  infrastructures and service sharing among governments. This framework should address the  problem of data and service locality. The framework should also address issues that come with  changing Cloud vendor or terminating a Cloud contact. It should be focusing on the terms and  conditions that should be in a SLA, and the enforceability of those terms and conditions to do so.  Second, an independent third party assurance can contribute to building trust whereby European  SME's and other organizations will use Cloud computing services more. The idea is to establish a  maturity level based framework, where governmental institutions will accredit the Cloud vendor,  and offers a kind of active and proactive escrow service by a third party, in such a way that this party  can assure a seamless takeover of the Cloud operations that provider A executes for a user to Cloud  provider B. This should therefore include the (functionality of the) software, the users’ data and the  current state of transactions.  Third, the public Cloud providers should improve their reputation and  trustworthiness.  More specifically a public/ community Cloud business model should be supported by:   An EU regulation on the use of multi-tenant infrastructures for eGovernment services;  Good Practice Guide for securely deploying Governmental Clouds  Page  33   A framework to evaluate/certify the public Cloud provider qualification (e.g. introducing  light auditing procedures, voluntary certification scheme)-(more details in recommendation  5.8);   A public procurement framework for all governmental bodies that need to procure Cloud  services;   Creating a legal framework to deal with cross border procurement;   The definition of standard procedures for application and data migration;   A framework to monitor/control data locality and data handling in general.  5.3 Recommendation 3: a framework to mitigate the “loss of control” issue  Loss of control of data and resources is one of the main barriers to gov-Cloud take-up, as indicated  by the 58% of the experts interviewed. The “loss of control” issue is not only a matter of  technologies but also of awareness, transparency, regulation, contractual agreements between  providers and governmental customers.  For example, from a theoretical point of view, when a governmental institution puts data and  applications in the Cloud it still remains the owner but, the lack of transparency of the Cloud  provider procedures (e.g. standard procedures for data disruption), the lack of common contractual  clauses and of an EU regulation, still leaves doubts on the Cloud provider potential to access and  ability to manipulate customers data. Another aspect of “loss of control” is the vendor lock-in  problem i.e. what is the mitigation action for bankruptcy of the Cloud provider cases. Concerning  vendor lock-in, from a technical point of view, without cost and time constraints, it should always be  possible to migrate data and applications from one Cloud provider to another. All these provisions  need to be agreed and declared in the services contract.  Actions  EC and MS competent authorities in cooperation with Cloud providers and government customers  should closely work to mitigate “loss of control” addressing the issues of governance, monitoring  and auditing, vendor lock-in and data handling. Required steps are:   Definition of a monitoring framework for Gov-Cloud public service layers. This monitoring  framework should allow central and local government to oversiee the Gov-Cloud platform  (operated by the CSP) running their eGovernment services. The monitoring framework,  provided itself as a Cloud service, should allow the proper view of the system, depending on  the service level used to implement the eGovernment services, i.e. IaaS, PaaS or SaaS. This  monitoring framework could become, in some cases, an alternative to auditing practices  that are discouraged by providers.   Definition of standard procedures for data handling. The standard procedures for data  handling should clearly define what are the access policies on data and applications for the  different service levels, how data are physically (or virtually) handled during the contract and  after a contract resolution.   Definition of standard procedures for data and service migration. The standard procedures  should clearly define the process behind the migration of services and data and the role of  the provider and of the customer in this process.  5.4 Recommendation 4: a regulatory framework to address the “locality  problem”  Cloud providers usually store data in their datacentres which can be located in many different  countries. The possibility to locate data and resources outside the country is often perceived as a  Good Practice Guide for securely deploying Governmental Clouds  Page  34  barrier for gov-Cloud adoption rather than an advantage for data privacy issues. The definition of  regulatory framework for data location can reduce the risks of objections from the governmental  users, but the most critical concern for data protection is to ensure the security of data more than  location of data. To achieve this, technical solutions (as for example, the use of encryption) are also  indicated as appropriate (see Recommendation 6). However, it is not only about taking technical  measures. Often local jurisdiction simply forbids that data owned by Government is located abroad.  Second, it is not only about location, but also about under which legal framework the Cloud provider  falls.  However it is important to note that it will be difficult and cost prohibitive for smaller countries to be  able to establish their own datacentres, we well as back-up centres. The regulatory framework  should take this into account  and offer solutions to overcome it.  Actions  The definition of a new framework requires that EC and MS competent authorities in cooperation  with Cloud providers and government customers to work closely on the following topics:   Definition of measures to improve the awareness of government agencies and Cloud service  providers on existing EU legislation on the subject;   Foster the development of technological solutions compliant with the existing legislation;   Categorization of specific governmental institution requirements on data ownership and  data privacy judged by the type of data handled;   Enhancement of the existing EU legislation on data and resource ownership with a focus  outsourcing;   Enhancement of the existing EU legislation on data privacy with a focus on outsourcing.  5.5 Recommendation 5: governmental Cloud solutions compliant to EU and  national law  To soften the scepticism of governmental institutions of the technological solution proposed by  service providers, measures should be promoted to encourage the development of systems and  services that are compliant with EU regulation and specific country legislation.  Actions  EC and MS competent authorities in cooperation with Cloud providers, governmental bodies,  standardisation bodies and R&D sector should closely work to promote the development of  technological solutions compliant to EU and national regulation.  Needed steps could be to:   Setup of an accreditation(certification) framework to certify or guarantee that each Cloud  solution is compliant with the relevant legislation (national and/or EU law) – specific  recommendation 8;   Promote the definition of standard contracts including regulatory compliance;   Promote the awareness of EU and country regulation;   Promote Cloud trainings and education on Cloud topics for EU governments.  Good Practice Guide for securely deploying Governmental Clouds  Page  35  5.6 Recommendation 6: a common framework for SLAs  The development of a common framework for standard service level agreements is largely debated  in the community. Survey results suggest (from a governmental customer’s point of view) additional  clauses: allowing penetration tests (about 60% of respondents to our survey), obligatory incident  reporting (about 65% of respondents to our survey) and the right to conduct auditing to the Cloud  provider (about 75% of respondents to our survey).  A common framework for SLAs should be a measure to boost the take-up of gov-Clouds. Having a  SLA framework will overthrow the difficulties government agencies could find in the definition of  contracts and the scepticism to public Cloud solutions. This work has been initiated in the EU Cloud  Strategy and ENISA has a supportive role.  Actions   Assurances and guarantees linked to the public organizations by the Cloud providers to  support security and privacy claims should be verified and assessed through the specific  penetration tests and with the introduction of auditing activities possibly through  independent third parties. Customers can leverage the attestations/reviews by 3rd party  auditors to avoid duplication.   The incident response and reporting obligation should be enforced in the contract with the  aims to push the providers to respond promptly to incidents, to report the ones that deem  critical and affect the availability of the services to the appropriate authorities and/or the  public users and to recover rapidly from the faults or the attacks.   The incident response and reporting is especially needed in the context of public services of  some level of criticality for the type of services or the sensitivity of the data. For those cases,  it should be helpful to differentiate the SLAs in terms of timelines of the response and the  reporting.   Penalties in case of service level constraints violation should be included in the contract. It  might be worth considering the creation of a reputation system (if not an entirely voluntary  accreditation scheme) that is used to inform of past violations to contracts of a similar  service or against similar standardised classifications.  5.7 Recommendation 7: Security measures for governmental Cloud  To define standard approach and procedures for the security certification of the services and/or the  providers. To ensure security for the public institutions, a maturity model must be developed;  consisting of sophistication levels that Cloud providers have to adapt via a certification scheme and  by defining clearly the requirements of each level of security. The accreditation model of the Cloud  services can be done by a dedicated central actor. The public users and providers should be free to  choose the level of security provided and requested for the public services, with positive effects on  the competition between providers and leaving the departments the possibility for implement the  most effective and the best value for money solutions. A set of security measures is the next step  after a risk assessment that should take place before deploying Cloud services. A specific set of  security measures focussed on governmental Cloud deployment would be the way to improve  trustworthiness in the Cloud supply chain.  Actions  Suggested actions to enhance the security and protection of information for the governmental Cloud  services are:  Good Practice Guide for securely deploying Governmental Clouds  Page  36   Support pre-assessment process before procuring services;   Create a set of  baseline security measures focussed on governmental Clouds; for this reason  the measures should include domains like security management, identity management, data  redundancy, services availability etc;   Include risk impact levels in each domain in order to offer a sohpistication/maturity model;   Enable voluntary auditing (and/or certification) framework of information security measures   Foster security labelling systems.  5.8 Recommendation 8: Certification framework  While considering a public-private management framework, 87% of respondents declared they  require the certification of the providers participating in public tender for governmental Cloud  services. The problem is when considering the public-public management framework because  certifications within the public institutions are not widely diffused. The governmental institutions  prefer to be compliant to standards without the need to be certified by an external auditor.  Currently the European Commission, under the EU Cloud Strategy, has launched the activities  supporting certification in the Cloud and more specifically creating one metaframework for all  providers to be accredited against. ENISA, is part of the selected industry group in charge of this  action, and fully supports the EC. This work has been initiated in the EU Cloud Strategy and ENISA  has a supportive role.  Actions   Moving towards the certification of gov-Cloud platform and services is a debated and  difficult process. The main driver to accomplish the goal can be to include this obligation in  an EU regulatory framework or a pan European voluntary certification scheme.   Consider leveraging global, industry led standards, as well as exploring government  requirements in other countries.   Support the creation of national “pre-assured Cloud products/applications and service  catalogues”. This approach reduces the cost of the service to be assured many times  introducing the “assure once- deploy many times” model.   This action can be combined with the previous recommendation on the security measures,  creating a pan European accreditation system for all providers that would like to offer Cloud  services to the public sector. A metaframework on information security domains, including  security controls per domain, classified in sophistication levels is a good starting point.  5.9 Recommendation 9: Foster research on governmental Cloud security.  To support the evolution of Cloud technologies compliant with government requirements it is  important to foster research on gov-Cloud computing leveraging existing research programmes.  Research should be oriented improve the risk-impact level of Cloud solution for governmental  services.  EC and the MSs R&D competent authorities in cooperation with academia, Cloud providers should  assure that existing and future national and European research programmes, such as Horizon 2020,  will incorporate into their work programmes research lines on gov-Cloud computing security  aspects. Some of these research lines (non-exhaustive list) are:   Cloud service life cycle management;  Good Practice Guide for securely deploying Governmental Clouds  Page  37   Cloud supply chain control;   Incident management;   Cyber risk analysis;   Cyber threat modeling;   Encryption;   Data protection;   Cloud privacy and security metric;   Privacy level agreement;   Data protection accountability and transparency;   Information assurance in Cloud systems.  Actions  EC and MS competent authorities in cooperation with Cloud providers, government customers, R&D  sector and academia should undertake the following actions:   Establish priorities for the different research objectives;   Make contact with existing security programmes at EU and National levels, such as Horizon  2020;   Work together with appropriate organisations and bodies (e.g. Framework Programme  Committee and Advisory Groups, Technology Platforms, etc.) to define an appropriate Work  Programme.  5.10 Recommendation 10: Privacy enforcement  Data protection is a vital aspect when we talk about governmental Clouds due to the sensitivity of  the information processed. The EC and MS should ensure Cloud services compliance with the EU  data protection laws. To guarantee privacy in the Cloud services encryption by the Cloud provider  and authenticated access by the users seems to be a straightforward solution. However the  implementation of cryptographic solutions in Cloud services still remains in low maturity level.  Actions  Data protection enforcement techniques have become a core issue; access control and  cryptographic techniques may provide part of the solution:   A clearly expressed and up-to-date policy about the management of personal information by  the agency, including information about likely disclosures to overseas recipients should be  considered;   In public Clouds usage of cryptographic solutions should be considered;   In IaaS and PaaS, as well as in private Clouds, cryptography doesn’t promote privacy  guarantees. In the private Cloud data security should be assured by other means like access  control, than cryptographic techniques;   In SaaS provisining, the provider should include cryptographic solutions to the contractual  agreement with the customer by default and not upon request;   When privacy is explicitly required in IaaS and PaaS, alternative solutions to the IaaS or PaaS  provider offering cryptographic  functions need to be considered. These may include the  government service encrypting data prior to their storage in the Cloud or the use of  cryptographic services (such as key management servers, access policy for the servers) that  are hosted and managed by a 3rd party (preferably a government department or a trusted  Good Practice Guide for securely deploying Governmental Clouds  Page  38  security service provider) that enable controling and attesting the enforcement of  cryptographic operations on the IaaS and PaaS environment.

The first conclusions  are evident: the Cloud uptake in Europe is not accelerated as expected in the European countries; in  this project, by investigating on the governmental Cloud uptake in the European countries, we  identified several issues that still need to be solved to give a boost to the public sector to adopt:   Lack of a concrete and unanimous definition of governmental Clouds;   The Cloud uptake in national level is slow due to lack of national Cloud strategies, privacy  and security constraints, lack of legal and contractual frameworks and relative immaturity of  the Cloud market;   Research needs to be promoted since many areas are still “undiscovered”.  Due to great diversity of Cloud solutions and the different approaches, it is difficult to reach a  consensus on fundamental aspects of Cloud security such as: common Cloud contract clauses,  common Cloud services model etc. In a relatively new environment with great deal of  competitiveness, getting all the big players together in a room and decide upon a baseline of  common requirements and models is a “mission impossible”.  This study is addressed to both the EC and the Member States. On the one hand the Member States  now are aware of the status of Cloud services implementation across the EU; knowledge can work as  an accelerator to the elaboration and implementation of a national Cloud strategy. The use cases  presented, demonstrate best practices on how to implement the provisions (or not) of a national  Cloud strategy according to the target outcome. The goal is to foster an information sharing  mentality between the respective parties across the EU, share the good practices and lesson learnt  and pave the way for a common set of security requirements for all Member States.  On the other hand, as indicated by the recommendations made in this study, the EC can play a very  important role in leading this kind of initiatives, bringing all the related parties (in collaboration with  the public and private sector) together to decide upon a common Cloud roadmap for Europe.  Taking into account the recommendations of this report, ENISA will continue to support all these  actions, by providing advice and recommendations to the Member States and competent  authorities. We will continue working on the topic of governmental Clouds deployment, scanning  Europe to investigate the Cloud uptake by the public sector, working on public procurement  requirements and issuing recommendations on how to design and implement a national Cloud  strategy. ENISA will also support the development of a pan European security certification  metaframework, working closely with the EC.

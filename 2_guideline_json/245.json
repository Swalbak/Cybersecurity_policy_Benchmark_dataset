This trend has been further reinforced by the continuous  development of relevant EU legislative and policy frameworks, such as the Network and  Information Security (NIS) Directive1, the EU Cybersecurity Act (CSA)2 and the Digital Single  Market Strategy3.  The NIS Directive represents the first EU-wide legislation on cybersecurity. Its objective is to  achieve a high common level of cybersecurity across all national ‘Operators of Essential  Service’ (OES). The identified OESs include various industries, such as energy, transport and  water distribution. The energy infrastructure is one of the most complex and, at the same time,  critical infrastructures that other business sectors depend upon to deliver essential services.  Therefore, unavailability in supply of energy may potentially have high impact on economy and  society. A potential disruption for a long period of time can cause a disfunctions in society,  industry and trade by even affecting the gross domestic product (GDP). As will be outlined in  this study, the NIS Directive has important implications for numerous organisations, including  those managing the electrical grid in the Member States. The ability for organisations to ensure  the cybersecurity of power supply is of fundamental value for the functioning of Member States  and the every-day lives of European citizens. As such, successful cyber-attacks may have a  devastating impact on the performance of power grids. By way of example, the 2015 cyber- attack in Ukraine4 cut the electricity of 225,000 households, damaged industrial control systems,  and resulted in lasting operational implications on the electricity grid for several weeks.  Meanwhile, it must be noted that the electricity industry is undergoing a radical transformation,  driven by political, economic, social, and environmental factors, as well as by the increased  digitalisation through the adoption of new technologies and new market entrants. Considering  the recent policy developments on IoT cybersecurity5, one could reasonably state that IoT  technologies are increasingly at the forefront of this transformation. Be that as it may, as  organisations continue to digitalise their operations and improve the flexibility of the grid to  accommodate renewable energy sources, their attack surface has increased. Vulnerable  (interconnected) IoT devices6 can be accessed by malicious actors, resulting in stolen  information or malicious activities that could cause disruptions to the safe operation of energy  assets, causing potential harm to individuals, organisations, or Member States.  In accordance with its mandate under the CSA, ENISA observes and analyses the cybersecurity  market in the European Union. It is within this context that ENISA delivers this report which aims  at analysing the IoT cybersecurity market in distribution grids in the European Union. This  analysis has been conducted as a proof of concept (PoC) of the initial version of the ENISA  1 https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32016L1148&from=EN, accessed 20 September 2021.  2 https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32019R0881&from=EN, accessed 20 September 2021.  3 https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:52015DC0192&from=EN, accessed 20 September  2021.  4 https://www.wired.com/2016/03/inside-cunning-unprecedented-hack-ukraines-power-grid/, accessed December 2021.  5 See for instance, EU's Cybersecurity Strategy for the Digital Decade, JOIN/2020/18 final, https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal- content/EN/ALL/?uri=JOIN:2020:18:FIN (see in particular Section 1.5 An Internet of Secure Things), accessed 13 January  2022; Council Conclusions on the cybersecurity of connected devices, 2 December 2020, 13629/20,  https://data.consilium.europa.eu/doc/document/ST-13629-2020-INIT/en/pdf, accessed 13 January 2022; Commission  Delegated Regulation of 29.10.2021 supplementing Directive 2014/53/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council  with regard to the application of the essential requirements referred to in Article 3(3), points (d), (e) and (f), of that Directive,  https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=PI_COM%3AC%282021%297672&qid=1638116539090, accessed 13  January 2022.

As described in ENISA Cybersecurity Market Analysis Framework (ECSMAF), the scoping is key  for the success of the analysis. The decision to conduct an analysis focused on IoT cybersecurity  market in distribution grids was made by taking into account a variety of scoping criteria such as:  level of adoption of IoT in the smart grid, size of the relevant market, reported level of exposure  to cyberthreats, assumed added value of the analysis for the stakeholders, but also available  project resources.  This report analyses demand and supply of IoT cybersecurity in distribution grids. Furthermore, it  provides detailed indications on how this market might further develop in the future. That being  said, the conclusions provided in the report are related to the envisaged scope, being thus non- exhaustive with regard to the entire smart-grid infrastructure. Moreover, in the frame of available  resources, the analysis is based on existing market data delivered by a contractor. While they  constitute a good sample to assess international market dynamics, trends and characteristics,  they do not encompass the complete picture of the EU IoT cybersecurity market. This can be  achieved in prospective, more targeted analyses of this market segment.  The research that was conducted resulted in the following highlights:  • IoT cybersecurity spending within the distribution grids of the EU-27 is mainly driven by  the adoption of electricity “smart” meters.  • From 2025 to 2030, the IoT cybersecurity market related to smart meters is expected to  be mainly driven by Operational Expenditures (OPEX) rather than Capital Expenditures  (CAPEX). In practice, this means that more capital is expected to be spent for the  maintenance of IoT cybersecurity (such as maintenance of security software installed in  IoT devices, e.g. software patches) than for the purchase of new cybersecurity hardware  or software.  • Analysis indicates that there are no IoT monopolies. Nonetheless, organisations tend to  favour larger IoT vendors that possess the necessary capabilities to cover a wide  spectrum of requirements, limiting the space for market entry of smaller organisations in  consequence.  • There are four main archetypes of suppliers within the IoT cybersecurity market, these  being: multi-domain industrial assets vendors, multi-domain IT vendors, specialist IoT  vendors, and IoT cybersecurity specialist vendors.  • The above-mentioned archetypes exhibit different competitive dynamics, i.e., focussing  on a particular market segment vs. diversification.  • The increase of demand for cybersecurity tools and services to improve its IoT  cybersecurity capabilities, represents one of the main trends by the energy industry.  • Embedded cybersecurity into IoT infrastructure and IoT management platforms  represents one of the trends on the supply-side portfolios.  • There are multiple technological development trends in the IoT cybersecurity market.  Among these, cyber-physical system security and operational technology security are  expected to materialize in the short term.  7 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/market-analysis-framework  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/market-analysis-framework  EU CYBERSECURITY MARKET ANALYSIS  April 2022  9  1. INTRODUCTION  1.1 SCOPING AND SELECTED THE FOCUS OF THE REPORT: IOT  CYBERSECURITY IN DISTRIBUTION GRIDS  This report analyses the IoT cybersecurity market in distribution grids covering both international  and European Union (EU) market developments.  This report is seen as a proof of concept (PoC) of an early version of the ENISA Cybersecurity  Market Analysis Framework (ECSMAF) that was developed by the Agency in 2021 and  published in April 20227.  As highlighted in the ECSMAF, scoping is a key step of the cybersecurity market analysis. While  other potential market segments were also considered for the analysis - in particular IoT  cybersecurity in connected health, IoT cybersecurity in connected industry, and IoT security in  connected cars -, after careful consideration, the IoT in distribution grids was selected as scope  for this analysis for different reasons: firstly, the market size, threat exposure,  adoption/opportunity growth and the policy-making focus/interest have been used for the  selection of this market segment. Secondly, it has been chosen to serve the purpose of piloting  an early version of the framework and achieve further improvements, where appropriate.  Thirdly, the selected scope allowed to conduct an analysis that met resource requirements and  project timeframe.  1.2 SPECIFICITIES OF THIS MARKET ANALYSIS  As mentioned above, this report serves as a Proof of Concept (PoC) of an early version of the  ENISA Cybersecurity Market Analysis Framework (ECSMAF) developed by ENISA in 2021 and  published in April 20227. The published version contains further improvements, accommodating  experiences/issues identified from this market analysis.  It must be noted that, on the one hand, some elements in the framework have not been used for  the present analysis (See 2.2.1 - Scoping the analysis and ECSMAF parametrization, ECSMAF  Version 1.0); on the other hand, this analysis contains some information not strictly foreseen in  the framework. For instance, available contractor data sources and knowledge/expertise were  largely used and injected into the present analysis where deemed appropriate, in some cases  going beyond the elements of the framework.  It is worth mentioning, that due to time constraints, the finalisation of Version 1.07 of the  framework was done in parallel to the completion of the PoC. Some changes were made to an  early version of the framework, following experiences from this pilot. However, the published  Version 1.0 includes some additional elements not used within this analysis, but will be used in  future ones.  Since the intention is to gradually improve the framework through further insights gained within  additional analyses, the ECSMAF will be gradually updated over the coming years.  Because of its scope, its purpose (i.e. serving as a PoC of the framework), the limited  resources and the restricted raw market data availability, this analysis could reach only a  certain level of detail and depth.  1.3 STRUCTURE OF THE REPORT  In accordance with the ECSMAF, this report is structured accordingly in five different sections:  EU CYBERSECURITY MARKET ANALYSIS  April 2022  10  1. Market structure: This section provides an estimation of the market size of IoT  cybersecurity in the EU.  2. Supply-side analysis: This section examines the key competitive trends of  representative market suppliers of IoT cybersecurity and defines the main archetypes  of suppliers within the market. Since the IoT cybersecurity vendor landscape is  predominantly global, this section looks at the market from a global perspective.  3. Demand-side analysis: This section provides the analysis of the key drivers of the  demand-side for IoT cybersecurity products or services.  4. Technology research: This section examines the key technology trends in the  market, assesses their significance for the wider IoT cybersecurity market and provides  an estimation of their projected materialisation in the EU.  5. Macro-environmental factors: This section identifies the external factors that could  have a significant impact on how the IoT cybersecurity market further develops in the  EU.  1.4 DATA COLLECTION  This analysis has been conducted based mainly on already available data, delivered by the  contractor. Due to time and resource restrictions, no primary research has been performed (i.e.  dedicated surveys).  Cut-off date of the data collection was end of November 2021. However, some documents  consulted after this cut-off date are also referenced in the analysis. They have been included  during the final review.  1.5 BACKGROUND: A CHANGING LANDSCAPE IN THE ELECTRICITY  INDUSTRY  Driven by developments in political, economic and social environments, as well as by new  technologies, the value chain of the electricity industry is undergoing the most significant  transformation for some decades. The traditional electricity grid — monopolistic, heavily  regulated, highly predictable, and unidirectional — is no longer adequate to meet new  environmental and consumption requirements.  The traditional electricity grid – both internationally and in the European Union - has worked  according to the same basic architecture and operational principles since the 20th century.  Power is generated at large power plants and fed into high-voltage transmission lines that  transport it over long distances. At multiple points along the way, power is transferred from the  transmission lines into local distribution lines, through substations where transformers lower the  voltage. Mid-voltage distribution grids then carry power via distribution lines to distribution  centres where the voltage is once again lowered to acceptable levels in order to be transferred  to end-consumption points.  Figure 1: Traditional architecture of the electricity grid  EU CYBERSECURITY MARKET ANALYSIS  April 2022  11  In sum, the architectural design of traditional distribution grids is based on one-way transmission  of power from a central power station through distribution level intermediaries to the end- consumers. As will be outlined in this report, this architecture is changing (see also Figure 3).  The increasing integration of renewable and distributed energy sources (e.g. electricity storage),  in combination with the introduction of new market mechanisms enabling increased participation  of customers in the electricity market (e.g. distributed generation), are contributing to the  transformation of the distribution grid architecture in order to support such bidirectional power  flows.  The technology-related challenges of this transformation are amplified by the fact that in most  countries the “traditional” electric grid has already historically grown into very complex networks.  Regulatory actions and limited investments of operators have resulted in an aging infrastructure  with significant technical complexity.  Arguably, the creation of a flexible and bidirectional system – where customers can also be  energy producers, energy managers and market participants – will require an adaptable and  technologically advanced distribution grid. Developing a dynamic grid that is able to absorb and  use the rapid expansion of distributed energy resources and other solutions will necessitate the  deployment of advanced digital technologies. Small and large grid owners and operators will  need to manage the electric power balance, to adjust their business models, while investing to a  modern grid infrastructure.  Inherently, the transformation entails a greater reliance on digital capabilities and dynamically  interconnected IoT devices. As a result, the digitalisation of grids makes owners, operators and  consumers more exposed to cybersecurity threats. Empirical evidence (i.e. number of incidents)  indicates that electricity grids are exposed to new threat vectors for multiple reasons, as outlined  in the subsequent paragraphs.  Firstly, there are several state and non-state actors seeking to inflict economic or security  damage to country-wide grid infrastructures. While malicious actors might have different  motives, the energy industry constitutes a prominent target due to their role in national  economies and the livelihood of citizens. By way of example, in 2018 it was reported that  Russian hackers acquired access to the control systems of multiple U.S. generation plants,  which could have resulted in shutdowns and blackouts.8 In addition, cybercriminals target the  energy sector and critical infrastructure for profit9.  Secondly, the nature of the energy sector is intrinsically linked to geographically distributed  assets and infrastructures (e.g. one could identify over 300 power plants10 and 11 million  kilometres of low voltage distribution lines11 across EU Member States). Geographically  distributed assets and infrastructure are also used for renewable energy sources including solar  and wind power. This geographical distribution complicates uniform visibility and maintenance of  Information Technology (IT) and Operational Technology (OT) systems.  A third factor is the extended lifespans of OT systems within the energy sector (e.g.  transformers often last for 30 to 40 years).12 These OT systems often run on legacy technology  that is only serviceable by a limited number of vendors, which have traditionally specialised in  8 https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-44937787, accessed 20 Sep 2021.  9 https://www.securityweek.com/australian-electricity-provider-cs-energy-hit-ransomware, accessed December 2021.  10 https://climateanalytics.org/briefings/eu-coal-phase-out/, accessed 20 Sep 2021.  11 https://www3.eurelectric.org/powerdistributionineurope/, accessed 20 Sep 2021.  12 https://www.powermag.com/clinging-to-power-why-extending-transformer-life-is- key/#:~:text=Under%20ideal%20conditions%2C%20transformers%20are,just%2020%20to%2025%20years., accessed 20  Sep 2021.  https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-44937787 https://www.securityweek.com/australian-electricity-provider-cs-energy-hit-ransomware https://climateanalytics.org/briefings/eu-coal-phase-out/ https://www3.eurelectric.org/powerdistributionineurope/ https://www.powermag.com/clinging-to-power-why-extending-transformer-life-is-key/#:%7E:text=Under%20ideal%20conditions%2C%20transformers%20are,just%2020%20to%2025%20years https://www.powermag.com/clinging-to-power-why-extending-transformer-life-is-key/#:%7E:text=Under%20ideal%20conditions%2C%20transformers%20are,just%2020%20to%2025%20years  EU CYBERSECURITY MARKET ANALYSIS  April 2022  12  OT rather than IT systems. As OT-IT technology converges, vendors have started to develop  new security related products and services often based IoT and analytics solutions.  Since state-of-the-art digital and security capabilities are often provided in an OPEX model (e.g.  SaaS), policy makers need to revisit whether current regulations are actually encouraging  owners and operators to adopt such services.  Finally, the policy and legal framework related to the cybersecurity of IoT is evolving. For  instance, according to the European Commission work programme for 202213, released on 19  October 2021, a proposal on a European cybersecurity resilience act (legislative) will be  published in Q3 2022”14 and it will aim to “establish common cybersecurity standards for  products”15, whereas  products will likely include interconnected IoT devices.  13 https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/default/files/com2021_645_en.pdf  14 https://www.europarl.europa.eu/legislative-train/theme-a-europe-fit-for-the-digital-age/file-european-cyber-resilience-act  15 https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/default/files/com2021_645_en.pdf  https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/default/files/com2021_645_en.pdf https://www.europarl.europa.eu/legislative-train/theme-a-europe-fit-for-the-digital-age/file-european-cyber-resilience-act https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/default/files/com2021_645_en.pdf  EU CYBERSECURITY MARKET ANALYSIS  April 2022  13  2. MARKET STRUCTURE  2.1 INTRODUCTION TO THE MARKET STRUCTURE  The IoT cybersecurity market has experienced similar developments as those experienced by the wider  IT market, with cybersecurity considerations often being secondary to the development of novel  infrastructure (both hard- and software), rather than an integral of the development phases (i.e., “security  by design”). As illustrated by Figure 2, an analysis of IoT adoption barriers clearly indicates that security  is the top concern of most IoT decision makers.  Figure 2: Top technical barriers to IoT implementation success - % of respondents16  16 https://www.gartner.com/document/3863770?ref=solrAll&refval=302383200, [restricted] accessed 20 Sep 2021.  https://www.gartner.com/document/3863770?ref=solrAll&refval=302383200  EU CYBERSECURITY MARKET ANALYSIS  April 2022  14  The expected vulnerabilities resulting the swift IoT-adoption and the fast-changing threat landscape are  leading to growing levels of spending on IoT security products and services.  2.2 .RESEARCH QUESTIONS  According to ECSMAF7 (See Section 2.1.1 - ECSMAF, Version 1.0), the two main elements of  the market structure and segmentation are the determination of value chain at scope and the  determination corresponding value stack. The three analysis dimensions for these elements are  the market size, the market growth and the market geographical distribution.  The analysis of the market structure of IoT cybersecurity in distribution grids addresses the  following research questions:  1. What is the size and the geographical distribution of the IoT cybersecurity market in the  EU-27 distribution grids?  2. Is the demand for IoT devices growing in the EU-27 distribution grids?  3. Is the demand for IoT cybersecurity growing in the EU-27 distribution grids?  4. How is the cybersecurity expenditure distributed between key assets of the distribution  grids?  5. How is the split between OPEX and CAPEX?  2.3 KEY ASSETS OF THE ELECTRICITY GRIDS FROM AN IOT  PERSPECTIVE: SMART TRANSFORMERS AND SMART METERS  Before replying to the research questions, it is important to highlight that the key assets of  electricity grid in scope from an IoT perspective are mainly:  1. smart transformers; and  2. smart metres.  Table 1: Description of assets of the electricity grid in scope  Asset / device Description  Smart transformers  High/Medium voltage transformers with smart actuators that help grid operators to  manage voltage levels and regulate the active and reactive power levels of the  distribution grid.  Smart meters Measure electricity consumption/generation readings and communicate this  information to energy organisations and end-users.  EU CYBERSECURITY MARKET ANALYSIS  April 2022  15  Figure 3: Assets of the electricity grid in scope  Smart transformers and smart metres are the most vital assets from an IoT perspective; both  are prone to different threat vectors and their protection requires protection services, leading to  additional cybersecurity spending. Smart transformers and smart metres have been selected as  the key assets when analysing the value chain and value stack related to IoT cybersecurity in  distribution grids. Figure 3 depicts the interplay of the key assets within a smart-grid.  The value chain at scope includes smart transformers and smart metres-related cybersecurity  hardware and software. It must be noted that in this market analysis, only hardware or software  components that can be installed in IoT endpoints were considered. As such, other components  or segments - such as gateway security, network security, or security applications used to  manage IoT devices - were disregarded, as they were considered as part of the individual  enterprise architecture of utility companies. Another examples of value stack considered in this  analysis are the implementation services of cybersecurity solutions and cybersecurity operation  services related to smart transformers and smart metres.  Electrical switchgears and measurement devices (such as voltage sensors) are also normally  present in low- and mid-voltage distribution lines. However, they have not been considered as  part of the market structure and segmentation of this report. Also the IoT management and  integration elements (for example cloud integration and IoT services) - not related to the  implementation of cybersecurity solutions and cybersecurity operation - were not considered for  this analysis. Moreover, connectivity issues of the key assets are also not taken into account,  assuming that necessary utilities for their operation are part of the contingency plans of the  generic smart grid infrastructure (i.e. uninterrupted power supply, fall-back network connections,  etc.).

The figures of Eurolectric18 were used to determine the number of installed MV/LV  (Medium voltage/low voltage) transformers in the EU-27 countries in 2013. The dataset  includes figures for all EU-27 countries except Croatia, Luxemburg, Malta, The  Netherlands, Slovakia and Sweden.  17 The countries are listed here in alphabetical order by country code.  18 https://www3.eurelectric.org/powerdistributionineurope/, accessed 20 Sep 2021.  https://www3.eurelectric.org/powerdistributionineurope/  EU CYBERSECURITY MARKET ANALYSIS  April 2022  17  2. The number of installed MV/LV transformers in the countries for which no public  information was obtained, is estimated on the assumption that the number of MV/LV  transformers is proportional to electricity consumption in those respective countries.  3. The CAGR (Compounded Annual Growth Rate)19 of electricity consumption in the EU- 27 between 2013 and 2018 was obtained. Since the EIA21 does not provide complete  electricity consumption data for the years 2019 and 2020, we use 2013 as a baseline  year and modelled the consumption growth based on available data points.  4. The number of installed MV/LV transformers between 2013 and 2030 is assumed to  grow according to the same CAGR as electricity consumption in the EU-27 countries  from 2013 to 2018. Electricity consumption data between 2018 and 2030 is assumed  to grow at the same rate as it did between 2013 and 2018. In consequence, we do not  account for potential factors that could accelerate electricity consumption in the future,  such as increased adoption of electric vehicles. We use assumption as a conservative  scenario to estimate the minimum number of endpoints/assets to be connected until  2030.  19 The compound annual growth rate (CAGR) is “the annualized average rate of revenue growth between two given years,  assuming growth takes place at an exponentially compounded rate” (from https://www.gartner.com/en/information-

 EU CYBERSECURITY MARKET ANALYSIS  April 2022  19  2.5.1.2 Adoption of IoT devices in MV/LV transformers in the EU-27  There are two adoption rationales behind the inclusion of IoT devices in MV/LV transformers  as to respond to the growing trend of grid digitalisation, these being:  1. The adoption of new transformers with “smart” capabilities (e.g. remote operation,  data sharing with utilities’ control centres).  2. Upgrading existing MV/LV transformers to enable “smart” capabilities, which is often  referred to as retrofit solutions.  2.5.1.3 Adoption of IoT devices in MV/LV transformers in the EU-27 (new “smart”  transformers)  On the basis of market research, three drivers for the installation of new “smart” transformers  can be identified in the product portfolios of multiple asset providers (e.g. General Electric24)  in distribution grids:  1. MV/LV “smart” transformers that are installed to meet the growing demand for  transformers due to of electricity consumption growth: These are mainly assets  that are installed to cope with a growing electricity demand and/or network  expansion. This figure is calculated based on the projection illustrated by Table 3.  2. MV/LV “smart” transformers that are installed to substitute failing assets:  These are mainly assets that are installed to replace failing assets. A failure rate of  0.3% of the installed transformers per year is assumed, complemented by 36% of  transformers that cannot be economically fixed and need replacement.25  3. MV/LV “smart” transformers that are installed to substitute assets that have  arrived at the end of its lifespan: This is mainly equipment that has met its lifespan  and needs replacement. We assume an average lifespan of 35 years for a MV/LV  transformer.26  Finally, we assume that 25% of the newly installed transformers27 provide “smart” capabilities,  i.e., IoT devices. As such, Figure 4 shows the total number of new transformers with IoT  devices installed in the EU-27 per year, and a categorisation of the three different reasons for  their instalment, as explained above.  24 https://www.gegridsolutions.com/hvmv_equipment/catalog/power_transformers.htm, accessed 20 Sep 2021.  25 http://vlabs.iitkgp.ac.in/vhvlab/html/pages/CD/topics_a-h/G-026-TEN-F.pdf, accessed 20 Sep 2021.  26 https://www.powermag.com/clinging-to-power-why-extending-transformer-life-is- key/#:~:text=Under%20ideal%20conditions%2C%20transformers%20are, accessed 20 Sep 2021.  27 Internal estimation based on previous engagements.  https://www.gegridsolutions.com/hvmv_equipment/catalog/power_transformers.htm http://vlabs.iitkgp.ac.in/vhvlab/html/pages/CD/topics_a-h/G-026-TEN-F.pdf https://www.powermag.com/clinging-to-power-why-extending-transformer-life-is-key/#:%7E:text=Under%20ideal%20conditions%2C%20transformers%20are https://www.powermag.com/clinging-to-power-why-extending-transformer-life-is-key/#:%7E:text=Under%20ideal%20conditions%2C%20transformers%20are  EU CYBERSECURITY MARKET ANALYSIS  April 2022  20  Figure 4: Number of MV/LV transformers replaced in the EU 27 - Replacement reasons (%)  per FY28  2.5.1.4 Adoption of IoT devices in MV/LV transformers in EU-27 (retrofit solutions)  Retrofitting legacy MV/LV transformers represents another driver for the implementation of  IoT devices in the distribution grids of the EU-27. Although new equipment generally comes  with built-in sensors and IoT capabilities, the acquisition of an “edge” box with IoT  capabilities to retrofit standard transformer costs approximately 5% of the price of a new  MV/LV transformer with enabled IoT capabilities29 can be considered as reasonable.  Incentivised by the challenging targets set by the EU Renewable Energy Directive and the  critical enabling role of the smart grid to ensure the necessary inclusion of renewables in the  distribution grid,30 it is assumed that by 2030 approximately 50% of EU’s MV/LV  transformers will possess dedicated IoT capabilities.  Additionally, according to expert estimations for 2021, only 5% of MV/LV transformers  installed in EU-27 countries have “smart” capabilities. Based on observed ambition levels  and plans of leading grid operators, the following adoption of “smart” transformers is  expected.  28 Numbers resulted from the market model.  29 Estimation based on Gartner proprietary data.  30 https://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy15osti/63919.pdf, accessed 20 Sep 2021.  https://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy15osti/63919.pdf  EU CYBERSECURITY MARKET ANALYSIS  April 2022  21  Figure 5: Estimated adoption of retrofitted MV/LV transformers - Replacement reasons (%)  per FY  On the basis of the assumed penetration rate for “smart” MV/LV transformers, as illustrated  by Figure 5, and by subtracting the number of new transformers installed – indicated in Table  3 – the results of Figure 6 stand for the adoption of retrofitted transformers in the EU-27.  Figure 6: Number of retrofitted MV/LV transformers in EU 27  - Absolute values per FY  2.5.1.5 IoT cybersecurity spending in “smart” MV/LV transformers  IoT cybersecurity spending per “smart” MV/LV transformer is either a share of the total cost  for the acquisition of IoT device used for the retrofit or of the new transformer. On the basis  of Gartner research, the IoT cybersecurity spending of a standard IT device ranges from  10% to 20% of the total acquisition cost (CAPEX)31 of which 70% corresponds to security  hardware and 30% to installed licenses for security software. These observations are  illustrated in Table 4.  31 https://www.gartner.com/document/3863770?ref=solrAll&refval=302902311, [restricted] accessed 20 Sep 2021.  https://www.gartner.com/document/3863770?ref=solrAll&refval=302902311  EU CYBERSECURITY MARKET ANALYSIS  April 2022  22  Furthermore, the operational expenditure (OPEX) is derived from the maintenance of security  software installed in IoT devices (e.g. software patches), which are estimated to represent  20% of the total acquisition costs.32  Table 4: Estimated IoT cybersecurity spending data per “smart” transformer  Factor Value  Data Processing Unit (DPU) price retrofitted transformer CAPEX (€)33 600  DPU price new transformer CAPEX (€) 480  Cybersecurity related spending (% of CAPEX DPU price)  15%  HW security spending (% of total security spending)  70%  SW security spending (% of total security spending)  30%  SW maintenance spending (% of SW security spending)  20%  Figure 7 shows the estimated market size of IoT cybersecurity for “smart” MV/LV  transformers.

We follow a two-step approach to  estimate the number of smart electricity meters installed in the EU-27 in 2021:  1. We take the figures of European Commission34 for the estimated number of  installed “smart” meters in the EU-27 countries in 2020. According to the source,  there was an installed base of approx. 260 million “smart” electricity meters in  2020.  2. We then project that figure to 2030 assuming the installed base will grow at the  same CAGR as population35 grew from 2013 to 2021. We neglect the first three  years of the decade to compute the CAGR aiming to avoid a disproportionate  negative effect of the financial crisis of 2008, as it had a negative impact on  population growth.36  34 https://op.europa.eu/en/publication-detail/-/publication/b397ef73-698f-11ea-b735-01aa75ed71a1/language-en,  accessed 16 Nov 2021.  35 https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/population-demography/demography-population-stock-balance/database,  accessed 20 Sep 2021.  36 https://www.oecd.org/economy/growth/The-effect-of-the-global-financial-crisis-on-OECD-potential-output-OECD- Journal-Economic-Studies-2014.pdf, accessed 30 Sep 2021.  https://op.europa.eu/en/publication-detail/-/publication/b397ef73-698f-11ea-b735-01aa75ed71a1/language-en https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/population-demography/demography-population-stock-balance/database https://www.oecd.org/economy/growth/The-effect-of-the-global-financial-crisis-on-OECD-potential-output-OECD-Journal-Economic-Studies-2014.pdf https://www.oecd.org/economy/growth/The-effect-of-the-global-financial-crisis-on-OECD-potential-output-OECD-Journal-Economic-Studies-2014.pdf  EU CYBERSECURITY MARKET ANALYSIS  April 2022  24  As Figure 8 shows, it is only expected a modest growth in the number of metering points  due to the very low population growth in EU-27 from 2013 to 2020.  Figure 8: Number of metering points in EU 27 - In Millions  2.5.2.2 Adoption of electricity “smart” meters in EU-27  The rather hesitant adoption of “smart” meters due to inhibiting factors – like a low level of  awareness regarding their added-value – has resulted in a market penetration that is  significantly lower than projected by Electricity Directive 2009/72/EC. Especially in countries  like Germany, where the market demonstrates large potential, specific requirements often  remain unclear and keep “smart” meters from being adopted at full scale, resulting in the  roadmap being postponed till 2030.  Full penetration (~100%) seems unlikely to be reached by 2030 in the EU, due to the  general reluctance in the adoption of technology by consumers. As of today, only a few  countries – namely Sweden, Finland, Italy, Estonia, Malta, Spain and Denmark – have  already shown a wide-scale roll-out. Most countries will reach such a wide-scale roll-out (to  at least 80 % of the consumers) in the period 2022-2025. About one third of the Member  States will roll-out smart meters by 2030 or later, as their latest CBA is still negative.  Under the assumption of a baseline penetration of ~49% in 2021 (based on the figures  provided in the 2018 benchmarking of the European Commission37) we expect a  penetration level of ~92% in 2030. With the advent of 5G and overall increasing adoption  levels of “smart” infrastructure, significant growth in the adoption of “smart” meters is implied  as well. A penetration level of 92% by 2030 does, however, indicate mainstream adoption  and is likely to be followed by slower yet continuous adoption, closing the gap in the  following decade.  Based on empirical market behaviour, we employ an S-shaped curve to illustrate the  adoption progress.  37 https://op.europa.eu/en/publication-detail/-/publication/b397ef73-698f-11ea-b735-01aa75ed71a1/language-en,  accessed 16 Nov 2021.  https://op.europa.eu/en/publication-detail/-/publication/b397ef73-698f-11ea-b735-01aa75ed71a1/language-en  EU CYBERSECURITY MARKET ANALYSIS  April 2022  25  Figure 9: Penetration rate of “smart” meters in EU 27 - Penetration rate (%) of ‘smart’  electricity meters per FY\"  Using the projections of metering points and the penetration S-curve, we illustrate in Figure  10 the estimated number of “smart” electricity meters deployed in EU-27 from 2021 to 2030.  Figure 10: Number of deployed “smart” electricity meters in EU 27 - In Millions  2.5.2.3 IoT cybersecurity spending in “smart” electricity meters  We estimate IoT cybersecurity spending per “smart” electricity meter as a share of the total  cost for the acquisition of a unit.  According to a study prepared for DG-ENER,38 the cost per unit of a “smart” meter varies  significantly across EU countries (Table 5 below). These differences can result from several  38 https://ec.europa.eu/energy/sites/default/files/documents/AF%20Mercados%20NTUA%20CBA%20Annex%20  June%2015.pdf, accessed 20 Sep 2021.  https://ec.europa.eu/energy/sites/default/files/documents/AF%20Mercados%20NTUA%20CBA%20Annex%20June%2015.pdf https://ec.europa.eu/energy/sites/default/files/documents/AF%20Mercados%20NTUA%20CBA%20Annex%20June%2015.pdf  EU CYBERSECURITY MARKET ANALYSIS  April 2022  26  factors, such as the functionalities covered by the device (e.g. existence of a display) or the  contractual agreements between countries and manufacturers.

DEMAND-SIDE RESEARCH  3.1 INTRODUCTION TO THE DEMAND-SIDE RESEARCH SECTION  Increased global demand for energy and the resulting environmental implications are  causing a global disruption in electric utilities. The pressure to maintain physical integrity  and modernize aging infrastructure under changing climate conditions and  consumption/production patterns continues. Moreover, technology-driven disruption at the  grid edge continues to challenge existing energy provisioning business models and pose  new threats. This is thereby stimulating a radical change in the digital capabilities required  by organisations to ensure the secure and efficient operation of the grid, including the  partner-to-partner orchestration and the load management.  Figure 13: Increase of complexity in the electricity grid architecture41  IoT device adoption is at the heart of the digitalisation of the electric utilities industry.  Organisations are rapidly increasing the number of installed IoT devices in the grid to  monitor and operate an increasing number of geographically distributed assets (e.g.  renewable energy technologies) and to enable residential consumers to participate in  electricity markets, such as demand response or regulation markets (e.g. load curtailing).  3.2 RESEARCH QUESTIONS FOR THE DEMAND-SIDE  The analysis of the demand-side addresses the questions:  41 https://www.gartner.com/document/3987468?ref=solrAll&refval=300909192, accessed 20 Sep 2021.  https://www.gartner.com/document/3987468?ref=solrAll&refval=300909192  EU CYBERSECURITY MARKET ANALYSIS  April 2022  30  1) Which are the main trends in the demand of IoT cybersecurity in the distribution  grids?  2) Which drivers can be identified for IoT cybersecurity adoption in the distribution  grids?  3.3 METHODOLOGY OF THE DEMAND-SIDE RESEARCH  The analysis of the demand-side of the IoT cybersecurity market is performed by taking into  account the trends and the key reasons for consumers of IoT cybersecurity (e.g. utilities) to  purchase IoT cybersecurity services or products; in other words to assume provision of  Hardware and Software, Distribution (of hardware and software), but also advisory &  consulting, Implementation services, managed services, and R&D and education, which are  all elements of the value stack42 for this market segment.  3.4 MARKET TRENDS ON THE DEMAND-SIDE  With widespread IoT deployments across grids and consumption points, it remains a  fundamental issue for many organisations to better assess the risk exposure of IoT devices.  As a result, the demand for cybersecurity tools and services aimed at improving IoT  cybersecurity capabilities of organisations will be increasing in the energy industry43; the  global demand for IoT cybersecurity in the energy industry is expected to grow with a 19.4%  Compounded Annual Growth Rate between 2018 and 2024.  According to a global survey conducted by IBM44, organisations identify the following IoT  cybersecurity threats as the top drivers to invest in IoT cybersecurity (see Figure 14). Given  that the utilities industry is dominated by large players with multinational presence (e.g.  Iberdrola, a Spanish utility, has presence in Europe, North and South America), we assume  that the results of this survey apply as well to utilities operating in the EU.  42 See Section 2.2.2 - Cybersecurity market taxonomy, ECSMAF Version 1.0,  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/market-analysis-framework  43 https://www.gartner.com/document/3981757?ref=solrAll&refval=300973953, accessed 20 Sep 2021.  44 Source: IBM Institute for Business Value benchmark study, 2018.  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/market-analysis-framework https://www.gartner.com/document/3981757?ref=solrAll&refval=300973953  EU CYBERSECURITY MARKET ANALYSIS  April 2022  31  Figure 14: Key drivers of IoT security demand vs. growth in utilities - In percentage (%)44  Players on the demand side look for cybersecurity solutions to respond to threats, including  those described below:  Exposure of sensitive/confidential data  As organisations in the energy value chain digitalise grid assets – such as wires,  substations, transformers and other field equipment with IoT technologies – IoT devices and  edge gateways become potential entry-points for cyberattacks that can target sensitive or  confidential data.  For example, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) reported in 201845 that the  Dragonfly espionage group — a group formed by cyberterrorists — accessed the Human  Machine Interfaces (HMI) that control processes at several North American power  generation utilities. While inside the system, the group copied configuration information and  gained the potential to sabotage or take control of the facilities.  45 https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ncas/alerts/TA18-074A, accessed December 2021.  https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ncas/alerts/TA18-074A  EU CYBERSECURITY MARKET ANALYSIS  April 2022  32  Production disruptions/shutdowns resulting from sabotage  According to Gartner, 70% of security products deployed by asset-intensive organisations  will stretch capabilities across converging IT/OT/IoT requirements by 2023, aligning to new  cyber-physical system (CPS) security approaches.46  The increasing interdependencies between IT and OT (e.g. physical assets such as  transformers) create high stakes for security officers. A disruption of one part of this  interdependent devices could very well affect other parts of the infrastructure. At worst,  consequences could include a loss of power, the destruction of equipment and damage to  devices throughout the grid. For example, a cyberattack targeting smart inverters that  control home solar systems’ “selling back” power to the grid, could overload parts of the  grid, thus damaging critical equipment and/or causing power outages.  Figure 15: IT, OT and IoT convergence  Damage to organization’s reputation/loss of public confidence  Over the last 10 years, the impact of data breaches has increased exponentially. Data  breaches not only result in direct financial costs for organisations in the form of legal  expenses and technology investments for increased data security, but also in large indirect  costs (i.e. lost customer relationships and decline in new business due to a drop in public  sentiment about the company).  46 https://www.gartner.com/document/3981757?ref=solrAll&refval=300591351, accessed 20 Sep 2021.  https://www.gartner.com/document/3981757?ref=solrAll&refval=300591351  EU CYBERSECURITY MARKET ANALYSIS  April 2022  33  Figure 16: Public sentiment index before and after security attack47  For example, to analyse the impact of data breaches on organisations’ reputation or brand  image, Gartner profiled 15 organisations that had experienced some of the biggest data  breaches between 2012 and 2018.48 A daily public sentiment index score was calculated for  each organisation and then aggregated to arrive at the average public sentiment index trend  line for an effected organization.  This analysis resulted in the following observations:   The average daily public sentiment index for four weeks before an incident is  slightly positive at 107 (100 equals neutral).   On day zero (the day the data breach is publicly announced), the public sentiment  index fell by 18%.   The average daily public sentiment index for four weeks after the incident is 7%  lower than the average index value for four weeks before the incident.   In the four weeks after day zero, the number of posts about an effected  organization increases by 30%.   The public sentiment index has a significant and positive correlation with stock  prices.  Violation of regulatory requirements/potential fines  The electricity system has always attracted the attention of regulators given its criticality for  macro-economic buoyance and social welfare. The upsurge in the number of cyberattacks  targeting OT that constitute part of national critical infrastructures during the last years, have  only exacerbated regulators’ interest in cybersecurity.  47 https://www.gartner.com/document/3945879?ref=solrResearch&refval=300698617, accessed 20 Sep 2021.  48 https://technologymagazine.com/cloud-and-cybersecurity/honeywell-and-microsoft-partner-industrial-cloud,  accessed 20 Sep 2021.  https://www.gartner.com/document/3945879?ref=solrResearch&refval=300698617 https://technologymagazine.com/cloud-and-cybersecurity/honeywell-and-microsoft-partner-industrial-cloud  EU CYBERSECURITY MARKET ANALYSIS  April 2022  34  Figure 17: Operational technology attacks trends - Monthly OT attack volume, comparing  the year 2016-2019 (Source: IBM X-Force)49  In recent years, the EU has made significant policy developments to enforce and harmonize  security requirements in critical infrastructures — the electricity grid being one of them —  across member countries.  In the Proposal for a Directive on measures for a high common level of cybersecurity across  the Union, repealing the current NIS Directive50, the European Commission has proposed  that energy, transport and financial organisations, as well as digital providers and makers of  medical and computer devices could be fined up to 2% of their global turnover for breaching  EU security rules under a European Commission proposal.51  Damage to equipment resulting from manipulation or physical events  The electric utilities sector is an asset intensive industry — i.e., an industry that requires  above average levels of capital to operate. Operating and maintaining grid assets presents  many challenges for organisations, ranging from optimizing grid operation to mitigating the  impact of unpredictable weather events. Poor management of these processes can result in  increased costs and reduced profitability over long periods of time.  Over the last decade, organisations have been faced with an unprecedented risk for the  secure operation of their grid assets, namely cybersecurity threats. Without adequate  security considerations, grid assets such as solar panels or windfarms, could thus become  the perfect target for hackers. For example, approximately thirty substations were  disconnected from the network in Ukraine in 2015. The cyberattack left eight provinces  without electricity for several hours, more than 200000 people affected, controls systems  49 https://www.muycomputerpro.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/ibm-x-force-threat-intelligence-index-2020.pdf,  accessed 20 Sep 2021.  50 See https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/ALL/?uri=COM:2020:823:FIN , accessed 12 December 2021.

Although cyberattackers’  attention has traditionally been focused on enterprise IT systems, malicious attention is now  increasingly turning to control systems.  Cyberattacks to control systems not only endanger the safety of energy assets, but also the  lives of individuals and workers. For example, a cyberattack in 1999 to the control systems  of a gas pipeline resulted in three deaths and eight injured after malicious actors caused the  pipeline to rupture near Bellingham, Washington, flooding two local creeks with 237,000  gallons of gasoline.  Potential for environmental harm/disaster  IoT devices also pose a pollution liability risk. In the event malicious access to the control  systems that manage the operation of grid or generation assets, significant environmental  damage can be caused by the adversary.  For example, an employee laid off by Chevron, an oil company, deactivated the company's  incident alert system by hacking into the computers in charge of the system. The intrusion  was only discovered when an emergency occurred at a Chevron refinery in Richmond which  exposed thousands of people living in proximity to toxic substance for several hours.53  Reduced visibility and control due to the complexity of IT systems being connected  to OT systems  According to Forrester, 82% of organisations are not able to identify all the devices  connected to their network54 and this problem is only expected to grow. Utilities are the  industry that use highest number of IoT endpoints, totalling 1.17 billion endpoints in 2019,  and increasing by 17% in 2020 to reach 1.37 billion endpoints55 (mainly driven by  widespread adoption of smart meters).  The key issue for organisations with these vulnerable IoT endpoints is that they may  become access points for cyber attackers, even without realising such security breach has  occurred.  For example, a recent security research at a wind-turbine farm indicated that physical  vulnerabilities and a lack of network security allowed researchers to traverse the entire wind  farm’s network within minutes. They have identified misconfiguration of access privileges  that would have enabled them to cause revenue losses of anywhere from $10,000 to  $30,000 per hour or even destroy the turbines entirely.56  52 https://ecs-org.eu/documents/publications/5fdb2673903c6.pdf, accessed 20 Sep 2021.  53 https://ecs-org.eu/documents/publications/5fdb2673903c6.pdf, accessed 20 Sep 2021.  54 https://www.csoonline.com/article/3262968/eliminate-the-iot-security-blind-spot.html, accessed 20 Sep 2021.  55 https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2019-08-29-gartner-says-5-8-billion-enterprise-and- automotive-io, accessed 20 Sep 2021.  56 https://www.blackhat.com/docs/us-17/wednesday/us-17-Staggs-Adventures-In-Attacking-Wind-Farm-Control- Networks.pdf, accessed 20 Sep 2021.  https://ecs-org.eu/documents/publications/5fdb2673903c6.pdf https://ecs-org.eu/documents/publications/5fdb2673903c6.pdf https://www.csoonline.com/article/3262968/eliminate-the-iot-security-blind-spot.html https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2019-08-29-gartner-says-5-8-billion-enterprise-and-automotive-io https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2019-08-29-gartner-says-5-8-billion-enterprise-and-automotive-io https://www.blackhat.com/docs/us-17/wednesday/us-17-Staggs-Adventures-In-Attacking-Wind-Farm-Control-Networks.pdf https://www.blackhat.com/docs/us-17/wednesday/us-17-Staggs-Adventures-In-Attacking-Wind-Farm-Control-Networks.pdf  EU CYBERSECURITY MARKET ANALYSIS  April 2022  36  Intellectual property theft  Beyond the theft of customer data, regulatory fines and reputational damage are other less- obvious costs for organisations that may result from cyberattacks. The theft of intellectual  property (IP) is an example hereto.  For example, in 2011 Night Dragon, a series of cyber-attacks, stole confidential information  from large oil players. The list of affected organisations included big, traditional players of  this industry, such as Exxon Mobil, Royal Dutch Shell and BP. The cyber-attacks took  gigabytes of highly sensitive internal documents, including proprietary information about oil-  and gas-field operations, project financing, and bidding documents.57  Additional user requirements  It must be noted, than this analysis of trends and drivers should not be considered as  exhaustive. The trends and drivers mentioned in this Chapter are only those that more  clearly emerged from the analysis conducted for this PoC, which, as explained earlier in this  report, was based mainly on already available data. By focusing on cybersecurity, this  analysis did not specifically focus on data protection. Additional primary research (i.e.  surveys) could lead to the identification of additional trends and drivers on the demand side,  regarding specifically privacy issues. This is particularly relevant, given the variation of  privacy requirements among various states at international level.  Besides cybersecurity solutions to respond to the above threats, some best practices for  cyber-security and privacy of the smart metering systems58 together with cybersecurity  baseline requirements have been developed by relevant associations59. One can assume  that the implementation of such good practices helps reducing the exposure to the threats  considered in this chapter.  57 https://isssource.com/%E2%80%98night-dragon%E2%80%99-cyber-attacks-big-oil/, accessed 20 Sep 2021.  58 2012/148/EU: Commission Recommendation of 9 March 2012 on preparations for the roll-out of smart metering  systems, https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/ALL/?uri=celex:32012H0148 , accessed 1 February 2022, and  European Commission, Best Available Techniques Reference Document for the cyber-security and privacy of the 10  minimum functional requirements of the Smart Metering Systems,  https://ec.europa.eu/energy/sites/ener/files/documents/bat_wp4_bref_smart-metering_systems_final_deliverable.pdf ,  accessed 1 February 2022.  59 Such as the European Smart Metering Infrastructure Group (ESMIG), and the European Network for Cybersecurity  (ENCS) together with the European Distribution System Operators (E.DSO).  https://isssource.com/%E2%80%98night-dragon%E2%80%99-cyber-attacks-big-oil/ https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/ALL/?uri=celex:32012H0148 https://ec.europa.eu/energy/sites/ener/files/documents/bat_wp4_bref_smart-metering_systems_final_deliverable.pdf  EU CYBERSECURITY MARKET ANALYSIS  April 2022  37  4. SUPPLY-SIDE RESEARCH  4.1 INTRODUCTION TO THE SUPPLY-SIDE ANALYSIS  The following sections present the research questions formulated for the supply-side  analysis, the methodology used, the archetypes of suppliers, as well as the trends identified  on the supply side.  4.2 RESEARCH QUESTIONS FOR THE SUPPLY-SIDE ANALYSIS  The analysis of the supply-side addresses the following research questions:  1. Which are the main archetypes of vendors in the global and EU market of IoT  cybersecurity products/services for distribution electricity grids?  2. What kind of IoT functional solutions/services is each archetype of vendors  providing to the market?  3. What kind of IoT cybersecurity solutions/services is each archetype of vendors  providing to the market?  4. How does the product portfolio of representative vendors look like?  5. What is the level of engagement of EU-headquartered and/or owned companies in  this market?  6. How does the market look like in terms of supply (competitiveness, market power,  etc.)?  7. Which areas of this market have the biggest potential for expansion or  improvement?  8. Which are the main trends on the supply-side?  4.3 METHODOLOGY OF THE SUPPLY-SIDE ANALYSIS  The analysis of the supply-side of the IoT cybersecurity market in distribution electricity  grids is structured in two different parts:  1. Analysis of key trends and competitive behaviours of key archetypes of suppliers  of IoT cybersecurity solutions or services.  2. Competitive profiles of selected vendors/suppliers of IoT cybersecurity  solutions/products.  It is important to highlight that the list of representative vendors below is not  exhaustive and more companies might be taken into account from the supply side.  The objective of this section is not to provide an exhaustive list of market players for  each archetype, but rather to analyse key trends emerging in the supply-side of the  IoT cybersecurity market. Due to resource constraints, the selection of vendors in  this analysis was based only on available data sources.  The selection of representative vendors was based on industry experts’ opinions,  estimated revenue sizes and product innovation approaches provided by Gartner.  4.4 ARCHETYPES OF SUPPLIERS  Four different archetypes of suppliers/vendors of IoT cybersecurity solutions or services  have been identified in the IoT cybersecurity market:  EU CYBERSECURITY MARKET ANALYSIS  April 2022  38  1. Multi-domain industrial assets vendors: Covers traditional vendors of assets,  equipment and OT systems that have expanded their market portfolio towards  digitalised solutions and services.  2. Multi-domain IT vendors: Covers large providers of IT solutions and/or services  that have expanded their offerings into the IoT cybersecurity market.  3. Specialist IoT vendors: Covers vendors of IoT solutions looking to complement  the capabilities of their IoT solutions with IoT cybersecurity capabilities.  4. IoT cybersecurity specialist vendors: Covers market vendors in IoT cybersecurity  that first entered the market with dedicated IoT cybersecurity offerings.  4.4.1 Multi-domain industrial assets vendors  Multi-domain industrial assets vendors are established operations technology original equipment  manufacturers (OT OEMs) with decades of experience in industrial control and automation  systems, machine-to-machine, as well as supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA)  solutions. These vendors tend to cover a wide spectrum of IoT components and are capable to  satisfy diverse requirements of large clients across markets and regions. Some of these vendors  have already recognised the need to digitalize their core business and are actively adding digital  capabilities to the industrial services and assets that they traditionally supply. While they may lag  behind other players (e.g. Multi-domain IT vendors) with respect to digital capabilities, they often  have a better understanding of the operational requirements of vertical industries due to their  long-standing relation as providers of industrial assets and O&M services. For example General  Electric, a large North American industrial group, launched GE Digital in 2015. This company  segment is specialised in software and IT services for industrial players, such as security  managed IT services or predictive maintenance software.60  60 https://www.ge.com/digital/, accessed 20 Sep 2021.  https://www.ge.com/digital/  EU CYBERSECURITY MARKET ANALYSIS  April 2022  39  Figure 18: Overview of the functional capabilities of some representative multi-domain industrial assets vendors  EU CYBERSECURITY MARKET ANALYSIS  April 2022  40  Figure 19: Overview of cybersecurity capabilities of some representative multi-domain industrial assets vendors  4.4.2 Multi-domain IT vendors  Multi-domain IT vendors are traditional IT giants that approach IoT from their position of strength in enterprise software infrastructure, applications, and  analytics. As such, these vendors see IoT as a logical extension and growth opportunity of their existing IT customer base. They tend to specialize in IoT  management, either by providing data-acquisition, connectivity, infrastructure, or data integration platforms.  EU CYBERSECURITY MARKET ANALYSIS  April 2022  41  While these vendors have a good understanding of the IT requirements of industrial actors, they tend not to focus on providing customised solutions that  address the different operational requirements of vertical industries. Most of these vendors are relatively new to the IoT market and are trying to build up IoT  capabilities by means of acquisitions of smaller vendors with higher specialisation in the IoT market.  Figure 20: Overview of functional capabilities of some multi-IT vendors  Whereas IT, OT and IoT environments gradually converge, multi-domain IT vendors are pursuing combined security offerings that provide a single point of  governance for the entire security functions within an organisation. Several of these vendors are oriented towards strategic acquisitions to reinforce their IoT  cybersecurity capabilities and set up specialised teams.  EU CYBERSECURITY MARKET ANALYSIS  April 2022  42  Figure 21: Overview of cybersecurity capabilities of some representative multi-domain IT vendors  EU CYBERSECURITY MARKET ANALYSIS  April 2022  43  4.4.3 Specialist IoT vendors  There are hundreds of smaller IoT providers, many of which focus on niche areas (e.g. based on vertical industry, use cases, horizontal value or geography,  etc.), with most having a more generic technology focus. For some, lower scale and limited resources combined with few to no differentiating capabilities, may  ultimately lead to low market recognition and slow revenue growth.  Figure 22: Overview of functional capabilities of some representative specialist IoT vendors  EU CYBERSECURITY MARKET ANALYSIS  April 2022  44  Some of the specialist IoT vendors may lack advanced IoT cybersecurity controls and reference primarily the functional capabilities of their products.  Nevertheless, due to regulatory progress in IoT/OT cybersecurity (e.g. IEC 62443 regulation) and increasing sophistication of the security practices of  large organisations, the requirement to adhere to IoT cybersecurity standards becomes essential (e.g. regarding Identity and Access management).  This is especially the case for those generating a significant portion of their revenues with large organisations.  Some vendors that could be categorised under this archetype, have decided to host their products in public cloud platforms (e.g. Microsoft Azure, Amazon  Web Services, Google Cloud) in order to take advantage of the advanced cloud controls available in these platforms.  Figure 23: Overview of cybersecurity capabilities of some representative specialist IoT vendors  EU CYBERSECURITY MARKET ANALYSIS  April 2022  45  4.4.4 IoT Cybersecurity specialist vendors  IoT Security specialist vendors are usually smaller players, especially when compared to large Multi-domain IT vendors. They tend to specialize in niche  IoT security markets or focus on developing innovative solutions to solve concrete IoT requirements, while enabling ease of integration with other IoT or  OT security platforms provided by larger players. IoT Security Specialist vendors are frequently targeted by acquisitions of larger players, in particular  due to their innovative IP in security solutions.  Figure 24: Overview of cybersecurity capabilities of some representative IoT cybersecurity specialist vendors  EU CYBERSECURITY MARKET ANALYSIS  April 2022  46  4.5 PROFILES OF REPRESENTATIVE MARKET PLAYERS  IoT vendors need to ensure differentiation from their competitors, in an environment dominated  by customer’s attention and revenue. The organisations that are described below provide a  representative cross-section of actors within the identified vendor archetypes.  Representative vendors of each archetype have been selected for the analysis based on  industry experts’ opinions, estimated revenue sizes and product innovation approaches  provided by Gartner.  4.5.1 General Electric  4.5.1.1 Product or portfolio overview  General Electric (GE) has traditionally specialised in supplying equipment (e.g. transformers) for  most actors across the electricity value chain (e.g. Distribution System Operators, utilities).  Currently, GE is expanding through a growing portfolio of digitally enabled equipment (e.g.  “Connected” transformers), solutions (e.g. GE Digital Predix) and services (e.g. software  implementation or certification).61  GE’s flagship product to manage IoT devices is GE Digital Predix, an application platform  designed for building IoT-enabled industrial data-intense and analytics-intense solutions. The  platform is based on a distributed application and service architecture and is delivered as a  platform as a service (PaaS) able to operate on the cloud and on-premises.62 The platform  includes use cases such as asset-intensive monitoring and automation, predictive maintenance,  operations optimisation, digital twin and other critical industrial use cases.  GE Digital Predix has been developed in compliance with security certifications for OT or IoT  equipment, such as the IEC 62443-2-4. GE offers security solutions such as Identification and  Authentication, IoT discovery and lifecycle management.  4.5.2 Hitachi ABB Power Grids  4.5.2.1 Product or portfolio overview  Hitachi ABB Power Grids (HAPG) is a joint venture formed on 1 July 2020 between Hitachi  (80.1%) and ABB (19.9%), with approximately $10 billion in business volume.63 HPAG has a  broad portfolio of equipment (e.g. transformers), solutions, and services (e.g. consulting and  advisory, maintenance) across the electricity value chain.64  HPAG’s competes with other providers through its Lumada IoT platform that aims to fulfil  requirements for asset-intensive industries like manufacturing, transportation, energy and  utilities. Lumada can be fully deployed in on-premises, hybrid and cloud-centric patterns, giving  customers a compelling range of options.65  HPAG’s provides IoT security with its JP1 product.

While most of them have  a reasonably digitalised product portfolio, their IoT management products may fall behind  those of multi-domain IT vendors.   Multi-domain IT vendors usually have strong capabilities in those areas where it is  critical to collect, manage, and present the data gathered by “smart” devices.   IoT specialist vendors usually have targeted but less sophisticated capabilities,  covering operational safety and regulatory requirements, as they tend to require lower  levels of capital to develop.  89 Information obtained from vendor’s websites.  90 Publicly listed companies are companies whose ownership is organized via shares of stock which are intended to be  freely traded on a stock exchange or in over-the-counter markets.  EU CYBERSECURITY MARKET ANALYSIS  April 2022  51  Figure 25: Summary of functional capabilities of vendor archetypes  Furthermore, on the basis of an assessment of the cybersecurity areas where the considered  vendor archetypes have strong or partial capabilities, the following market trends from a security  perspective were defined:   Multi-domain industrial asset vendors tend to show untapped potential with respect to  their IoT cybersecurity. Many have gained further cybersecurity capabilities in the last years  by means of acquisitions but are still working on integrating them into holistic market offerings.   Multi-domain IT vendors tend to have strong IoT cybersecurity capabilities in most of  the areas because of their long-standing position in multiple IT market segments.   Specialist IoT vendors tend to offer limited cybersecurity capabilities in most IoT  cybersecurity areas because of their traditional lack of focus on IoT cybersecurity.   IoT cybersecurity specialist vendors tend to specialize in those IoT cybersecurity  market segments not targeted by larger vendors. They have emerged in developing  market segments where they leverage innovative technologies to ensure differentiation.  Figure 26: Summary of cybersecurity capabilities of vendor archetypes  EU CYBERSECURITY MARKET ANALYSIS  April 2022  52  In addition, when focusing on IoT, there is a clear distinction from the trends seen within IT,  where there is a varied and crowded stand-alone cybersecurity marketplace. With IoT, this is  unlikely to happen due to the requirements and limitations of deploying software in many IoT  environments. As such, embedded cybersecurity has been observed as a preferable option  here. As a result, it is expected that – despite a relatively small number of successful stand- alone cybersecurity product providers exploiting current cybersecurity gaps – in the medium to  long term, IoT infrastructure and platforms will increasingly embed required cybersecurity  features at the endpoint or as part of the networking infrastructure.  Traditional IT security vendors are exploiting this trend by making their data interoperable with  multiple, potentially available IT security solutions – e.g. Security Operations Centres (SOCs),  ticketing systems, or security orchestration. In this manner, compatibility with existing security  solutions and products can be achieved. The modularity angle associated with platform-based  features and functionalities is attractive to end-users, who can adapt them based on their  current security infrastructure, needs and maturity.  The platform business model also implies that vendors can increasingly offer pricing models  based on software-as-a-service and provide more cloud-based and analytics-centric solutions.  Some vendors now offer both, passive on-premises solutions for brownfield systems (e.g.  already installed grid assets), as well as active, cloud-based solutions for greenfield systems.  The rise of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) technologies has also spurred  the emergence of smaller players with solutions to fulfil concrete cybersecurity requirements  with innovative approaches that are often easier to deploy. They may address evolving needs  and requirements of utilities that can be integrated in the utilities’ existing operations technology  (OT) security platforms.  Traditional vendors of electricity grid assets (e.g. transformers) are also present in the IoT  cybersecurity market. They have progressed in the digitalisation of their legacy offerings and  came to realize the business opportunity in bundling IoT cybersecurity solutions and services  that reach across their assets, OT and IoT commercial offerings. A selection of vendors in that  space tends to offer a high degree of specialisation in the utilities industry, which often has  unique cybersecurity needs due to the types of systems and protocols deployed, unique sales  cycles, or safety and security requirements.  Finally, the IoT cybersecurity market also includes vendors that are specialised in functional  components, such as IoT connectivity solutions or smart metering devices. Although the IoT  cybersecurity segment does not necessarily represent a core market for these vendors, they are  increasingly adding IoT cybersecurity features to their products in order to address the growing  concern of utilities with cybersecurity threats.  EU CYBERSECURITY MARKET ANALYSIS  April 2022  53  5. TECHNOLOGY RESEARCH  5.1 INTRODUCTION TO THE TECHNOLOGY RESEARCH SECTION  The digital transformation in the utilities industry goes hand-in-hand with an increasing number  of data sources, systems, and interconnected assets of various kinds. Ultimately, the  connectivity of endpoints with modern, open network technologies and IoT platforms is the  foundation of the digitalisation of the utilities industry.  Consequentially, electricity grids are becoming less isolated from outside networks due to the  need to:  • coordinate decentralised, intermittent, and non-dispatchable generation assets (e.g.  renewable energy sources),  • manage the growing penetration of distributed energy resources (e.g. Photovoltaic  Panels) installed at consumption endpoints and,  • manage the evolving role of consumers as active market players (e.g. demand  response, generation, storage).  Less isolation and more integration require a different approach to cybersecurity where “trust  levels” of different types, with very strict levels of what each entity might be able to do, play a  key role.  At the heart of this change is the demand to integrate enterprise IT systems in order to digitalise  organisations for remote connectivity to improve operations, automation and lower operation  costs. However, as legacy systems and grid assets (e.g. transformers) evolve toward more- connected systems, their cybersecurity posture is increasingly challenged.  The use of IoT technologies has unique safety, business continuity and physical security  implications. As attack surface increases due to the increasing number of connected devices,  the need to address physical threats and cyberthreats will lead to the adoption of emerging  technologies to address an array of environments spanning across the utilities industry (i.e.  cyber-physical systems).  5.2 RESEARCH QUESTIONS ON TECHNOLOGY  The technology research analysis addresses the question on which key technological trends  regarding IoT cybersecurity are noticeable within distribution grids.  5.3 METHODOLOGY OF TECHNOLOGY ANALYSIS  This report examines technology trends in IoT cybersecurity in context of the electricity  distribution grids. The technology analysis addresses the following research questions:  1. Which are the (main) technology trends that are perceived in the market?  2. When these trends are expected to have a significant impact on the market?  3. What impact these trends will have on relevant markets?  Time to impact or “range” is measured in the years to early majority adoption. This is when  technology adoption is “ready for prime time.” It is important to point out that the time to  technology impact or range is not the same as the time to act on the technology. When and how  product leaders should act depends on the company’s business strategy. Providers that want to  EU CYBERSECURITY MARKET ANALYSIS  April 2022  54  be “first movers” with an emerging technology trend, will need to act far sooner than those that  are comfortable with waiting for their competition to compel them into action.  The “mass” component examines the extent of the impact on existing products and markets. To  assess how massive the impact is, two main aspects – breadth and depth – are taken into  consideration. The breadth of impact refers to how many sectors are affected (i.e. products,  services, markets, business functions, industries, and geographies). The depth of the impact  includes an analysis of the potential disruption to existing products, services, and markets.  Due to the global nature of technology research and innovation, we assume that global  technology trends in IoT cybersecurity correspond with those present in the EU.  5.4 IOT CYBERSECURITY TECHNOLOGY TRENDS IN DISTRIBUTION  GRIDS  The subsequent technology trends in IoT cybersecurity have been identified as relevant within  the context of this report:  1. Cyber-physical system security;  2. Operational Technology security;  3. Positioning, Navigation, and Timing (PNT) security;  4. Digital Risk Protection Services, and  5. Homomorphic Encryption.  In the figure below, five different technology thrends are positioned in an impact radar according  to Gartner’s analysis.91  Figure 27: Impact radar of emerging technology trends in IoT cybersecurity  91 https://www.gartner.com/document/3981757?ref=solrAll&refval=300973953, accessed 20 Sep 2021.  https://www.gartner.com/document/3981757?ref=solrAll&refval=300973953  EU CYBERSECURITY MARKET ANALYSIS  April 2022  55  5.4.1 Cyber-physical system security  Cyber-physical systems (CPS) are defined as engineered systems that orchestrate sensing,  computation, control, networking, and analytics to interact with the physical world (including  humans). As such, they enable safe, real-time, secure, reliable, resilient, and adaptable grid  operation.  CPS in distribution grids is emerging through the convergence of IT, OT and ET systems,  through increased use of IoT-like sensors (e.g. voltage meters) in the grid, through remotely  controlled or maintained systems or via deployment of new algorithms and automation  solutions.  The need for a comprehensive and coordinated security approach will require organisations to  deploy cyber-physical systems solutions that cover the entire cyber-physical risk spectrum.  The product capabilities will range across the spectrum of an adaptive security model, from  prevention tools (such as network firewalling and endpoint security tools), to detection  mechanisms (such as system monitoring and inventorying) and predictive solutions (like threat  intelligence).  Emerging CPS security use-cases, in which controls apply across IT, IoT, OT and physical  environments, include:   Real-time visibility and asset discovery for every asset connected to enterprise  networks, regardless of where they reside, and whether they are managed by  engineering, operations or IT;92   Managed detection and response (MDR) and incident response (IR) services;93   Best-of-breed approaches to threat intelligence and vulnerability management that  consider the uniqueness of OT environments in combination with IT security principle.  5.4.1.1 Range: Now  CPS-Sec technology has become a critical area of focus for utilities and grid operators. This is  due to the increased number of threat vectors targeting utilities, such as the Snake/EKANS  ransomware, which has successfully impacted several organisations such as Enel,94 in 2020.  According to Gartner, 50% of security products and services marketed today as “Internet of  Things (IoT)” will focus on industry-specific CPS-Sec needs by 2023, compared with a negligible  number today.95  5.4.1.2 Mass: Medium  The overall mass for CPS-Sec is estimated to be medium.96 As organisations continue to  automate and connect assets to drive increased productivity, CPS will continue to deploy.  5.4.2 Operational Technology security  OT security is the practice of protecting critical production and operational systems and services  in asset-centric enterprises, such as the utilities industry. As the OT market moves toward more- connected systems and newly designed “greenfield” systems (e.g. connected transformers), the  traditional OT management, governance, infrastructure and security become part of a broader  security effort defined that becomes intertwined with IoT and IT security.  92 https://www.gartner.com/document/3991219?ref=authbottomrec&refval=4001838 , [restricted] accessed 20 Sep 2021,  93 https://www.gartner.com/document/3981757?ref=solrAll&refval=300973953, accessed 20 Sep 2021.  94 https://blog.malwarebytes.com/threat-analysis/2020/06/honda-and-enel-impacted-by-cyber-attack-suspected-to-be- ransomware/, accessed 20 Sep 2021.  95 https://www.gartner.com/document/3981757?ref=solrAll&refval=300973953, accessed 20 Sep 2021.  96 https://www.gartner.com/document/3981757?ref=solrAll&refval=300973953, accessed 20 Sep 2021.  https://securityboulevard.com/2020/06/ekans-strikes-again-honda-and-enel-taken-down-by-ransomware/ https://www.gartner.com/document/3991219?ref=authbottomrec&refval=4001838 https://www.gartner.com/document/3981757?ref=solrAll&refval=300973953 https://blog.malwarebytes.com/threat-analysis/2020/06/honda-and-enel-impacted-by-cyber-attack-suspected-to-be-ransomware/ https://blog.malwarebytes.com/threat-analysis/2020/06/honda-and-enel-impacted-by-cyber-attack-suspected-to-be-ransomware/ https://www.gartner.com/document/3981757?ref=solrAll&refval=300973953 https://www.gartner.com/document/3981757?ref=solrAll&refval=300973953  EU CYBERSECURITY MARKET ANALYSIS  April 2022  56  5.4.2.1 Range: Now  OT security has become a critical area of focus for utilities. Trying to protect critical  infrastructures, along with trying to preserve safety and reliability at a time when digital  transformation and the need to automate business operations is presenting new risks.  This progress has been driven by fast growth and adoption rates, with an estimated CAGR of  36% from 2021 to 2022.97 This growth has been supported by a diverse number of use-cases,  such as smart-grid implementations where advanced data sharing capabilities between utilities’  operation and planning IT systems with OT are required.  5.4.2.2 Mass: Medium  OT security’s impact on existing products and markets is expected to be medium. Network  security equipment, vulnerability management, endpoint security and professional services are  among the most impacted markets where providers are looking to expand capabilities to meet  rising demand.  According to Gartner,98 as utilities’ maturity in OT security increases an increasing number of IT  security activities and controls will be applied to OT environments. This trend is expected to  accelerate the interest of established IT services/security in this market, and perhaps drive  consolidation, i.e., reduction of the number of market players in the market as a result of larger  players acquiring smaller, OT-specialised market players.  For example, Atos, a French provider of IT services, recently acquired Cryptovision in order to  strengthen its security product line.  5.4.3 Positioning, Navigation, and Timing (PNT) security  Positioning, navigation, and timing (PNT) is a combination of three capabilities:   Positioning, which is the ability to determine location and orientation accurately and  precisely;   Navigation, which is the ability to determine current and desired position, correct  course, orientation, and speed to attain a desired position anywhere around the world,  and   Timing, which is the ability to acquire and maintain accurate and precise time from a  standard (Coordinated Universal Time, or UTC), anywhere in the world.  PNT is provided by Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSSs), such as the Global  Positioning System (GPS), Galileo, GLONASS and BeiDou Navigation Satellite System. The  most widely used PNT service is GPS.  Information on positioning, if not properly protected, might expose the power grids, e.g. thus  becoming the target of a drone attack. In addition, GPS equipment, as a source of precision  timing, is vulnerable to different forms of deliberate attack, as well as unintentional  compromises99. GPS is used by many applications deployed to manage grid operations in the  electricity subsector, leading thus to materialization of risks to operations, if GPS accuracy is  compromised.  Top electricity distribution applications for precision timing include Sequence of Events  (SOE)/Digital Fault Recorders (DFR), protective relays, synchro-phasor measurements, and  97 https://www.gartner.com/document/code/352921?ref=authbody&refval=3991219, accessed 20 Sep 2021.  98 https://www.gartner.com/document/3981757?ref=solrAll&refval=300973953, accessed 20 Sep 2021.  99 For an analysis on threats against energy providers’ services see the ENISA report on ‘Power Sector Dependency on  Time Service: attacks against time sensitive services’, https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/power-sector-dependency,  accessed 17 January 2022.  https://www.gartner.com/document/code/352921?ref=authbody&refval=3991219 https://www.gartner.com/document/3981757?ref=solrAll&refval=300973953 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/power-sector-dependency  EU CYBERSECURITY MARKET ANALYSIS  April 2022  57  disturbance monitoring and reporting.100 Protective relays, for example, depend on precision  timing to synchronize monitoring samples and telecommunication equipment.101  5.4.3.1 Range: Short (1 to 3 Years)  Although illegal jammers are already using transmitters to interfere with GPS signals to  scramble or alter location and time of IoT devices, this trend is expected to materialize in 1 to 3  years.102  Several techniques are already emerging to counteract PNT cyberthreats, such as using  encrypted systems and communications, obscuring antennas/install decoys, duplicate  antennas, blocking antennas, or ground-based navigation beacons.  5.4.3.2 Mass: Low  Gartner estimates the overall mass to be overall low. Many assets are still static, although digital  transformation using automation and robotics is increasing, accelerated by the COVID-19  pandemic.103  5.4.4 Digital Risk Protection Services  The digital risk protection services (DRPS) market is composed of technology and service  providers offering solutions developed to protect critical digital assets and data exposed to  external threats. These solutions provide visibility into the clear (surface) web, dark web and  deep web sources to identify potential threats to critical assets and provide contextual  information on threat actors, their tactics and processes utilized to conduct malicious activity.  DRPS provides support in four areas:  mapping, monitoring, mitigating, and managing the  impact on critical digital assets. They ensure that business operations are preserved.  5.4.4.1 Range: Medium (3 to 6 Years)  The estimated distance to the early majority target is anticipated to be at about 5% to 20% of  the journey, at a rather early stage. Otherwise, the pace of investment growth in this technology  is fairly fast and is expected to drive swift adoption of this new technology. DRPS offerings are  particularly valuable for manufacturing organisations that give particular value to their brand.  The ability to protect against phishing campaigns is also key for this vertical, particularly as  cybercriminals seem to increasingly target this sector.  5.4.4.2 Mass: Medium  The impact of DRPS on existing products and markets is medium. This comes as a result of  overlapping with some complementary mainstream cybersecurity offerings, such as threat  intelligence (TI), social media security, endpoint protection platforms (EPPs), secure email  gateways (SEGs) and managed security services (MSSs). Here, providers have been able to  expand offerings by adding DRPS to their service catalogues as an integration to their core  capabilities, as well as stand-alone DRPS. Growing interest in DRPS-type of capabilities will  impact a growing number of sectors (e.g. automotive, consumer goods), seeking out new  market opportunities.  New providers are expanding capabilities to cover the whole spectrum of digital risks, stretching  to the cyber-physical layer and public cloud environments. This is creating new opportunities  and expanding the reach to new buying roles, such as chief marketing officers, chief privacy  officers and chief information officers.  5.4.5 Homomorphic Encryption  100 https://www.epri.com/research/products/000000003002020266, accessed 20 Sep 2021.  101 https://www.gartner.com/document/3945879?ref=solrResearch&refval=300698617, accessed 20 Sep 2021.  102 https://www.gartner.com/document/3981757?ref=solrAll&refval=300591351, accessed 20 Sep 2021.  103 https://www.gartner.com/document/3981757?ref=solrAll&refval=300973953, accessed 20 Sep 2021.  https://www.epri.com/research/products/000000003002020266 https://www.gartner.com/document/3945879?ref=solrResearch&refval=300698617 https://www.gartner.com/document/3981757?ref=solrAll&refval=300591351 https://www.gartner.com/document/3981757?ref=solrAll&refval=300973953  EU CYBERSECURITY MARKET ANALYSIS  April 2022  58  Homomorphic encryption (HE) is a cryptographic method that enables third parties to process  encrypted data and return an encrypted result to the data owner, while providing no knowledge  about the data or the results. HE enables providers to protect proprietary algorithms and data  owners to keep data private. In practice today, fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) is not fast  enough for most manufacturing implementations. As such, partially homomorphic encryption  (PHE) might be a more practical implementation.  As the IoT market matures, stored sensor data collected through countless sensor nodes must  be protected as intellectual property and other sensitive data are vulnerable to attack. HE is  useful to provide encryption to sensor data that can be shared across an ever-growing number  of interconnected meters and actuators installed across the distribution grid.  5.4.5.1 Range: Medium (3 to 6 Years)  Homomorphic encryption is three to six years out, because several factors are inhibiting the  adoption in the near term. Performance issues, cost, lack of standardization and complexity are  expected to slowly progress to the early maturity stage.  5.4.5.2 Mass: Low  Gartner expects low mass from in the HE market, given cost and performance issues for real- time data needed for distribution grids operation. In addition, computational costs for HE might  be out of reach for many utilities.104  104 https://www.gartner.com/document/3981757?ref=solrAll&refval=300973953, accessed 20 Sep 2021.  https://www.gartner.com/document/3981757?ref=solrAll&refval=300973953  EU CYBERSECURITY MARKET ANALYSIS  April 2022  59  6. MACRO-ENVIRONMENTAL  FACTORS  6.1 INTRODUCTION TO THE MACRO-ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS  SECTION  As the IoT cybersecurity market continues to grow in the EU, different factors that determine the  end-user’s IoT cybersecurity adoption process will increase in influence.  A macro-environment refers to the set of conditions that exist in the economy as a whole, rather  than in a particular sector or region. As described in Section 2.1.5 of ECSMAF Version 17 PEST  analysis is one of the most frequently applied measurement tool, used to analyse how four  external factors (Political, Economic, Social and Technology) affect the operations of an  organisation or a specific market segment, in particular:  1. Political: These factors play a critical role, not only in investment decisions (e.g. IoT  cybersecurity investment), but they also can alter the long-term sustainability of  different markets. Some examples include the governance system, regulations,  democracy and institutions.  2. Economic: These factors have a direct impact on the potential attractiveness of a  given market in a particular region or country. Some examples are inflation rate, GDP  growth rate, Foreign Exchange Rate, or disposable income level.  3. Social: These factors can be usually linked to workforce talent availability and the level  of demand. Some examples include the power structure in the society, women  participation in the workforce, emerging end-user behaviour, etc.  4. Technology: These are factors that relate to innovations in technology that may affect  the operations of organizations and a specific market segment. They refer to  technology advancement and maturity, the emergence of disruptive technologies, the  level of innovation, automation, research and development (R&D) activity,  technological change and the amount of technological awareness that a market  possesses.  Other additional factors, not included in the PEST analysis that could be considered are  environmental factors (some examples include greenhouse emissions, or habitat destruction)  and legal factors (e.g. cybersecurity related requirements). Both environmental and legal  factors are important for this analysis on IoT cybersecurity of distribution grids and are covered  in this chapter.  6.2 RESEARCH QUESTIONS  The analysis of macro-environmental factors addresses the question:  • Which macro-environmental factors are influencing IoT cybersecurity in EU distribution  grids?  6.3 METHODOLOGY OF ANALYSIS  This section examines macro-environmental factors that could have a significant impact on how  the IoT cybersecurity market further develops. Additionally, the results of the analyses  presented in this reported — especially those of the market model — could be impacted by  these factors.  EU CYBERSECURITY MARKET ANALYSIS  April 2022  60  The report is not meant to be exhaustive but rather to present exemplary key factors that could  affect how this market develops in the future. Further research could be conducted for selected  factors as the market continues to evolve – e.g. a dedicated deep dive on which regulatory  changes that need to happen to accelerate the adoption of security services projected to an  OPEX model.  6.4 MACRO-ECONOMIC FACTORS OF THE IOT CYBERSECURITY  MARKET  6.4.1 Accelerated electrification of vehicles in EU  As carmakers roll out moderately priced electricity-fuelled models and electric batteries, while  increasing capacity and reducing cost,105 the sales of electric vehicles (EVs) are rapidly gaining  ground in the EU market. Some projections indicate that these may outpace the sales of  combustion engines by 2033.106  The availability of EV charging points remains a fundamental challenge for EV adoption around  the globe. In the EU, 70% of the existing EV charging points are concentrated in three Member  States107 — namely, the Netherlands, France and Germany. In stark contrast, other EU  Members States such as Romania possess only 0.2% of the total EV charging points installed  in the EU.  Figure 28: Distribution of EV charging points in the EU.108  Even though some EU Member States show modest coverage, new policy developments are  expected to significantly accelerate the demand for EV charging points and IoT devices. We  recognize that a further adoption of EVs in the EU could have an impact in the estimated  electricity consumption in the EU-27 between 2021 and 2030. As a result, the IoT cybersecurity  market of “smart” transformers could grow at a higher pace than the projections shown  previously in this report (see Figure 6).  105 https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-02222-1, accessed 20 Sep 2021.  106 https://energynews.us/2021/08/10/commentary-the-united-kingdoms-electric-vehicle-plans-could-be-a-blueprint-for-the- u-s/, accessed 20 Sep 2021  107 https://www.reuters.com/article/eu-cybersecurity-idUSKBN28Q1NS, accessed 20 Sep 2021.  108 https://www.acea.auto/publication/making-the-transition-to-zero-emission-mobility-2020-progress-report/, accessed 20  Sep 2021.  https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-02222-1 https://energynews.us/2021/08/10/commentary-the-united-kingdoms-electric-vehicle-plans-could-be-a-blueprint-for-the-u-s/ https://energynews.us/2021/08/10/commentary-the-united-kingdoms-electric-vehicle-plans-could-be-a-blueprint-for-the-u-s/ https://www.reuters.com/article/eu-cybersecurity-idUSKBN28Q1NS https://www.acea.auto/publication/making-the-transition-to-zero-emission-mobility-2020-progress-report/  EU CYBERSECURITY MARKET ANALYSIS  April 2022  61  6.4.2 Aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic  While COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated the adoption of digital technologies across many  industries, the impact on the electric grids is less direct and needs further analysis. We  recommend planning dedicated research activities on this subject as part of a wider research  agenda.  6.4.3 Available green bonds and government funding for energy  transformation  Green bonds are designated bonds intended to encourage sustainability and to support climate- related or other types of special environmental targets, such as energy efficiency projects, CO2  reduction, etc.  Green bonds come with tax incentives such as tax exemption and tax credits, making them a  more attractive investment compared to a comparable taxable bond. These tax advantages  provide a monetary incentive to private investors.  To progress with its roadmap to become carbon-neutral by 2050,109 the EU has recently  launched their Green Bonds program110 aimed at financing member states’ environmental  beneficial projects, taking its first step to potentially become the biggest issuer of  environmentally friendly debt with a record-sized deal.  We make the hypothesis that depending on the success of this program, the adoption of “smart”  meters and transformers could be accelerated. As a result, the market projections of the IoT  cybersecurity market presented in this report would accelerate.  6.4.4 Limited workforce to execute on grid digitalisation  The combination of a decreasing EU’s working-age population and poor attractiveness of the  construction sector is generating challenges for construction companies to fill job vacancies  across EU. For example, between 2010 and 2018, the Czech Republic and Slovenia recorded  the largest increase in the share of vacancies to the amount of people employed in the sector  (621.9% and 411.7% respectively).111  As a result, we make the hypothesis that depending on how the availability of skilled  construction workers develops, there may not be enough workers to execute grid digitalisation  projects and, even if funding is available, the adoption rates of IoT cybersecurity assumed for  this report may not be achieved.  6.4.5 Accelerated growth in electricity consumption because of global  warming  The accumulation of greenhouse gases in Earth’s atmosphere destabilises the temperature  equilibrium and has far-reaching effects on energy consumption patterns.112  Extreme weather and climate conditions have strong influence on energy consumption, which  directly affects planning and operations of these systems.113 For example, several studies  109 https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_20_335, accessed 20 Sep 2021.  110 https://www.reuters.com/business/sustainable-business/eu-starts-sale-debut-green-bond-ifr-2021-10-12/, accessed 12  Oct 2021.  111 https://ecs-org.eu/documents/publications/5fdb2673903c6.pdf, accessed 20 Sep 2021.  112 https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/frsc.2021.644789/full, accessed 20 Sep 2021.  113 Ronalds, B. F., Wonhas, A., and Troccoli, A. (2010). “A new era for energy and meteorology,” in Weather Matters for  Energy, eds A. Troccoli, L. Dubus and S. E.

As a result, the IoT cybersecurity market of “smart” transformers could grow at a higher  pace than the projections shown in this report.  6.4.6 Relevant legal framework of IoT cybersecurity in distribution grids  Current legal framework and ongoing or planned legislative and policy initiatives related to the  cybersecurity of IoT in distribution grids play an important role. For instance, privacy  requirements contribute to shape the market. And the importance of privacy is proved by a  number of initiatives taken, with the most important one being the Privacy Impact Assessment  for smart meters driven by European Commission115.  114 Sailor, D. J., and Munoz, J. R. (1997). Sensitivity of electricity and natural gas consumption to climate in the U.S.A.  Methodology and results for eight states.

CONCLUSIONS  This report offers interesting insights into the transformation of the traditional electricity industry  and the increasing role of IoT technologies in this regard. Furthermore, it examines both the  supply and demand side of the smart grid IoT cybersecurity ecosystem in the EU.  As organisations continue to digitalise their operations and improve the flexibility of the grid to  accommodate renewable energy sources, their attack surface has also increased; an evolution  that has been documented and assessed in this report.  7.1 MAIN FINDINGS  The main findings of this report are:  • IoT cybersecurity spending within the distribution grids of the EU-27 is mainly driven by  the adoption of electricity “smart” meters.  • From 2025 to 2030, the IoT cybersecurity market related to smart metres is expected  to be mainly driven by Operational Expenditures (OPEX) rather than Capital  Expenditures (CAPEX). In practice, this means that more capital is expected to be  spent for the maintenance of IoT cybersecurity (such as maintenance of security  software installed in IoT devices, e.g. software patches), than for the purchase of new  cybersecurity hardware or software.  • Analysis indicates that there are no IoT monopolies. Organisations tend to favour  larger IoT vendors that possess the necessary capabilities to cover a wide spectrum of  requirements, limiting the space for market entry of smaller organisations in  consequence.  • There are four main archetypes of suppliers within the IoT cybersecurity market, these  being: multi-domain industrial assets vendors, multi-domain IT vendors, specialist IoT  vendors, and IoT cybersecurity specialist vendors.  • The above-mentioned archetypes exhibit different competitive dynamics, i.e., focussing  on a particular market segment vs. diversification.  • The increase of the demand by the energy industry for cybersecurity tools and services  to improve IoT cybersecurity capabilities of organisations represents one of the trends  on the demand-side.  • Embedded cybersecurity into IoT infrastructure and platforms represents one of the  trends on the supply-side.  • There are multiple technological trends developing in the IoT cybersecurity market.  Among these, cyber-physical system security and operational technology security are  expected to materialize in the short term.  7.2 WAYS FORWARD  This report analyses the IoT cybersecurity market in distribution grids in EU and has served as a  proof-of-concept of an early version of the ENISA Cybersecurity Market Analysis Framework  that was developed in 20217. While confirming the good overall functioning of the framework, it  helped identify aspects of the framework that can be improved.  Some improvements have been already included in the initial version of the framework, which is  expected to further evolve based on the experience that ENISA will gather by applying the  framework to conduct additional analyses. In 2022 and beyond, ENISA, also with the support of  EU CYBERSECURITY MARKET ANALYSIS  April 2022  64  the recently established Ad Hoc Working Group (AHWG) on EU Cybersecurity Market116, will  conduct additional cybersecurity market analyses. Such activities could focus for instance on  other IoT markets, and/or on horizontal aspects of the EU cybersecurity market (e.g.  cybersecurity certification). Based on the experience from conducting the present analysis,  particular attention will be given to the definition of the scope of future analyses, since the  scoping represents an important initial element for the outcome of the analysis and the usability  of achieved results.  116 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/standards/adhoc_wg_calls/ad-hoc-working-group-on-cybersecurity-market,  accessed 13 December 2021.  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/standards/adhoc_wg_calls/ad-hoc-working-group-on-cybersecurity-market  EU CYBERSECURITY MARKET ANALYSIS  April 2022  65  A ANNEX: COVERED IOT  CYBERSECURITY MARKET  SEGMENT  Most relevant cybersecurity segments and categories for IOT device are highlighted in light  blue in the next table.

This trend has been further reinforced by the continuous  development of relevant EU legislative and policy frameworks, such as the Network and  Information Security (NIS) Directive1, the EU Cybersecurity Act (CSA)2 and the Digital Single  Market Strategy3.  The NIS Directive represents the first EU-wide legislation on cybersecurity. Its objective is to  achieve a high common level of cybersecurity across all national ‘Operators of Essential  Service’ (OES). The identified OESs include various industries, such as energy, transport and  water distribution. The energy infrastructure is one of the most complex and, at the same time,  critical infrastructures that other business sectors depend upon to deliver essential services.  Therefore, unavailability in supply of energy may potentially have high impact on economy and  society. A potential disruption for a long period of time can cause a disfunctions in society,  industry and trade by even affecting the gross domestic product (GDP). As will be outlined in  this study, the NIS Directive has important implications for numerous organisations, including  those managing the electrical grid in the Member States. The ability for organisations to ensure  the cybersecurity of power supply is of fundamental value for the functioning of Member States  and the every-day lives of European citizens. As such, successful cyber-attacks may have a  devastating impact on the performance of power grids. By way of example, the 2015 cyber- attack in Ukraine4 cut the electricity of 225,000 households, damaged industrial control systems,  and resulted in lasting operational implications on the electricity grid for several weeks.  Meanwhile, it must be noted that the electricity industry is undergoing a radical transformation,  driven by political, economic, social, and environmental factors, as well as by the increased  digitalisation through the adoption of new technologies and new market entrants. Considering  the recent policy developments on IoT cybersecurity5, one could reasonably state that IoT  technologies are increasingly at the forefront of this transformation. Be that as it may, as  organisations continue to digitalise their operations and improve the flexibility of the grid to  accommodate renewable energy sources, their attack surface has increased. Vulnerable  (interconnected) IoT devices6 can be accessed by malicious actors, resulting in stolen  information or malicious activities that could cause disruptions to the safe operation of energy  assets, causing potential harm to individuals, organisations, or Member States.  In accordance with its mandate under the CSA, ENISA observes and analyses the cybersecurity  market in the European Union. It is within this context that ENISA delivers this report which aims  at analysing the IoT cybersecurity market in distribution grids in the European Union. This  analysis has been conducted as a proof of concept (PoC) of the initial version of the ENISA  1 https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32016L1148&from=EN, accessed 20 September 2021.  2 https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32019R0881&from=EN, accessed 20 September 2021.  3 https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:52015DC0192&from=EN, accessed 20 September  2021.  4 https://www.wired.com/2016/03/inside-cunning-unprecedented-hack-ukraines-power-grid/, accessed December 2021.  5 See for instance, EU's Cybersecurity Strategy for the Digital Decade, JOIN/2020/18 final, https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal- content/EN/ALL/?uri=JOIN:2020:18:FIN (see in particular Section 1.5 An Internet of Secure Things), accessed 13 January  2022; Council Conclusions on the cybersecurity of connected devices, 2 December 2020, 13629/20,  https://data.consilium.europa.eu/doc/document/ST-13629-2020-INIT/en/pdf, accessed 13 January 2022; Commission  Delegated Regulation of 29.10.2021 supplementing Directive 2014/53/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council  with regard to the application of the essential requirements referred to in Article 3(3), points (d), (e) and (f), of that Directive,  https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=PI_COM%3AC%282021%297672&qid=1638116539090, accessed 13  January 2022.

As described in ENISA Cybersecurity Market Analysis Framework (ECSMAF), the scoping is key  for the success of the analysis. The decision to conduct an analysis focused on IoT cybersecurity  market in distribution grids was made by taking into account a variety of scoping criteria such as:  level of adoption of IoT in the smart grid, size of the relevant market, reported level of exposure  to cyberthreats, assumed added value of the analysis for the stakeholders, but also available  project resources.  This report analyses demand and supply of IoT cybersecurity in distribution grids. Furthermore, it  provides detailed indications on how this market might further develop in the future. That being  said, the conclusions provided in the report are related to the envisaged scope, being thus non- exhaustive with regard to the entire smart-grid infrastructure. Moreover, in the frame of available  resources, the analysis is based on existing market data delivered by a contractor. While they  constitute a good sample to assess international market dynamics, trends and characteristics,  they do not encompass the complete picture of the EU IoT cybersecurity market. This can be  achieved in prospective, more targeted analyses of this market segment.  The research that was conducted resulted in the following highlights:  • IoT cybersecurity spending within the distribution grids of the EU-27 is mainly driven by  the adoption of electricity “smart” meters.  • From 2025 to 2030, the IoT cybersecurity market related to smart meters is expected to  be mainly driven by Operational Expenditures (OPEX) rather than Capital Expenditures  (CAPEX). In practice, this means that more capital is expected to be spent for the  maintenance of IoT cybersecurity (such as maintenance of security software installed in  IoT devices, e.g. software patches) than for the purchase of new cybersecurity hardware  or software.  • Analysis indicates that there are no IoT monopolies. Nonetheless, organisations tend to  favour larger IoT vendors that possess the necessary capabilities to cover a wide  spectrum of requirements, limiting the space for market entry of smaller organisations in  consequence.  • There are four main archetypes of suppliers within the IoT cybersecurity market, these  being: multi-domain industrial assets vendors, multi-domain IT vendors, specialist IoT  vendors, and IoT cybersecurity specialist vendors.  • The above-mentioned archetypes exhibit different competitive dynamics, i.e., focussing  on a particular market segment vs. diversification.  • The increase of demand for cybersecurity tools and services to improve its IoT  cybersecurity capabilities, represents one of the main trends by the energy industry.  • Embedded cybersecurity into IoT infrastructure and IoT management platforms  represents one of the trends on the supply-side portfolios.  • There are multiple technological development trends in the IoT cybersecurity market.  Among these, cyber-physical system security and operational technology security are  expected to materialize in the short term.  7 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/market-analysis-framework  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/market-analysis-framework  EU CYBERSECURITY MARKET ANALYSIS  April 2022  9  1. INTRODUCTION  1.1 SCOPING AND SELECTED THE FOCUS OF THE REPORT: IOT  CYBERSECURITY IN DISTRIBUTION GRIDS  This report analyses the IoT cybersecurity market in distribution grids covering both international  and European Union (EU) market developments.  This report is seen as a proof of concept (PoC) of an early version of the ENISA Cybersecurity  Market Analysis Framework (ECSMAF) that was developed by the Agency in 2021 and  published in April 20227.  As highlighted in the ECSMAF, scoping is a key step of the cybersecurity market analysis. While  other potential market segments were also considered for the analysis - in particular IoT  cybersecurity in connected health, IoT cybersecurity in connected industry, and IoT security in  connected cars -, after careful consideration, the IoT in distribution grids was selected as scope  for this analysis for different reasons: firstly, the market size, threat exposure,  adoption/opportunity growth and the policy-making focus/interest have been used for the  selection of this market segment. Secondly, it has been chosen to serve the purpose of piloting  an early version of the framework and achieve further improvements, where appropriate.  Thirdly, the selected scope allowed to conduct an analysis that met resource requirements and  project timeframe.  1.2 SPECIFICITIES OF THIS MARKET ANALYSIS  As mentioned above, this report serves as a Proof of Concept (PoC) of an early version of the  ENISA Cybersecurity Market Analysis Framework (ECSMAF) developed by ENISA in 2021 and  published in April 20227. The published version contains further improvements, accommodating  experiences/issues identified from this market analysis.  It must be noted that, on the one hand, some elements in the framework have not been used for  the present analysis (See 2.2.1 - Scoping the analysis and ECSMAF parametrization, ECSMAF  Version 1.0); on the other hand, this analysis contains some information not strictly foreseen in  the framework. For instance, available contractor data sources and knowledge/expertise were  largely used and injected into the present analysis where deemed appropriate, in some cases  going beyond the elements of the framework.  It is worth mentioning, that due to time constraints, the finalisation of Version 1.07 of the  framework was done in parallel to the completion of the PoC. Some changes were made to an  early version of the framework, following experiences from this pilot. However, the published  Version 1.0 includes some additional elements not used within this analysis, but will be used in  future ones.  Since the intention is to gradually improve the framework through further insights gained within  additional analyses, the ECSMAF will be gradually updated over the coming years.  Because of its scope, its purpose (i.e. serving as a PoC of the framework), the limited  resources and the restricted raw market data availability, this analysis could reach only a  certain level of detail and depth.  1.3 STRUCTURE OF THE REPORT  In accordance with the ECSMAF, this report is structured accordingly in five different sections:  EU CYBERSECURITY MARKET ANALYSIS  April 2022  10  1. Market structure: This section provides an estimation of the market size of IoT  cybersecurity in the EU.  2. Supply-side analysis: This section examines the key competitive trends of  representative market suppliers of IoT cybersecurity and defines the main archetypes  of suppliers within the market. Since the IoT cybersecurity vendor landscape is  predominantly global, this section looks at the market from a global perspective.  3. Demand-side analysis: This section provides the analysis of the key drivers of the  demand-side for IoT cybersecurity products or services.  4. Technology research: This section examines the key technology trends in the  market, assesses their significance for the wider IoT cybersecurity market and provides  an estimation of their projected materialisation in the EU.  5. Macro-environmental factors: This section identifies the external factors that could  have a significant impact on how the IoT cybersecurity market further develops in the  EU.  1.4 DATA COLLECTION  This analysis has been conducted based mainly on already available data, delivered by the  contractor. Due to time and resource restrictions, no primary research has been performed (i.e.  dedicated surveys).  Cut-off date of the data collection was end of November 2021. However, some documents  consulted after this cut-off date are also referenced in the analysis. They have been included  during the final review.  1.5 BACKGROUND: A CHANGING LANDSCAPE IN THE ELECTRICITY  INDUSTRY  Driven by developments in political, economic and social environments, as well as by new  technologies, the value chain of the electricity industry is undergoing the most significant  transformation for some decades. The traditional electricity grid — monopolistic, heavily  regulated, highly predictable, and unidirectional — is no longer adequate to meet new  environmental and consumption requirements.  The traditional electricity grid – both internationally and in the European Union - has worked  according to the same basic architecture and operational principles since the 20th century.  Power is generated at large power plants and fed into high-voltage transmission lines that  transport it over long distances. At multiple points along the way, power is transferred from the  transmission lines into local distribution lines, through substations where transformers lower the  voltage. Mid-voltage distribution grids then carry power via distribution lines to distribution  centres where the voltage is once again lowered to acceptable levels in order to be transferred  to end-consumption points.  Figure 1: Traditional architecture of the electricity grid  EU CYBERSECURITY MARKET ANALYSIS  April 2022  11  In sum, the architectural design of traditional distribution grids is based on one-way transmission  of power from a central power station through distribution level intermediaries to the end- consumers. As will be outlined in this report, this architecture is changing (see also Figure 3).  The increasing integration of renewable and distributed energy sources (e.g. electricity storage),  in combination with the introduction of new market mechanisms enabling increased participation  of customers in the electricity market (e.g. distributed generation), are contributing to the  transformation of the distribution grid architecture in order to support such bidirectional power  flows.  The technology-related challenges of this transformation are amplified by the fact that in most  countries the “traditional” electric grid has already historically grown into very complex networks.  Regulatory actions and limited investments of operators have resulted in an aging infrastructure  with significant technical complexity.  Arguably, the creation of a flexible and bidirectional system – where customers can also be  energy producers, energy managers and market participants – will require an adaptable and  technologically advanced distribution grid. Developing a dynamic grid that is able to absorb and  use the rapid expansion of distributed energy resources and other solutions will necessitate the  deployment of advanced digital technologies. Small and large grid owners and operators will  need to manage the electric power balance, to adjust their business models, while investing to a  modern grid infrastructure.  Inherently, the transformation entails a greater reliance on digital capabilities and dynamically  interconnected IoT devices. As a result, the digitalisation of grids makes owners, operators and  consumers more exposed to cybersecurity threats. Empirical evidence (i.e. number of incidents)  indicates that electricity grids are exposed to new threat vectors for multiple reasons, as outlined  in the subsequent paragraphs.  Firstly, there are several state and non-state actors seeking to inflict economic or security  damage to country-wide grid infrastructures. While malicious actors might have different  motives, the energy industry constitutes a prominent target due to their role in national  economies and the livelihood of citizens. By way of example, in 2018 it was reported that  Russian hackers acquired access to the control systems of multiple U.S. generation plants,  which could have resulted in shutdowns and blackouts.8 In addition, cybercriminals target the  energy sector and critical infrastructure for profit9.  Secondly, the nature of the energy sector is intrinsically linked to geographically distributed  assets and infrastructures (e.g. one could identify over 300 power plants10 and 11 million  kilometres of low voltage distribution lines11 across EU Member States). Geographically  distributed assets and infrastructure are also used for renewable energy sources including solar  and wind power. This geographical distribution complicates uniform visibility and maintenance of  Information Technology (IT) and Operational Technology (OT) systems.  A third factor is the extended lifespans of OT systems within the energy sector (e.g.  transformers often last for 30 to 40 years).12 These OT systems often run on legacy technology  that is only serviceable by a limited number of vendors, which have traditionally specialised in  8 https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-44937787, accessed 20 Sep 2021.  9 https://www.securityweek.com/australian-electricity-provider-cs-energy-hit-ransomware, accessed December 2021.  10 https://climateanalytics.org/briefings/eu-coal-phase-out/, accessed 20 Sep 2021.  11 https://www3.eurelectric.org/powerdistributionineurope/, accessed 20 Sep 2021.  12 https://www.powermag.com/clinging-to-power-why-extending-transformer-life-is- key/#:~:text=Under%20ideal%20conditions%2C%20transformers%20are,just%2020%20to%2025%20years., accessed 20  Sep 2021.  https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-44937787 https://www.securityweek.com/australian-electricity-provider-cs-energy-hit-ransomware https://climateanalytics.org/briefings/eu-coal-phase-out/ https://www3.eurelectric.org/powerdistributionineurope/ https://www.powermag.com/clinging-to-power-why-extending-transformer-life-is-key/#:%7E:text=Under%20ideal%20conditions%2C%20transformers%20are,just%2020%20to%2025%20years https://www.powermag.com/clinging-to-power-why-extending-transformer-life-is-key/#:%7E:text=Under%20ideal%20conditions%2C%20transformers%20are,just%2020%20to%2025%20years  EU CYBERSECURITY MARKET ANALYSIS  April 2022  12  OT rather than IT systems. As OT-IT technology converges, vendors have started to develop  new security related products and services often based IoT and analytics solutions.  Since state-of-the-art digital and security capabilities are often provided in an OPEX model (e.g.  SaaS), policy makers need to revisit whether current regulations are actually encouraging  owners and operators to adopt such services.  Finally, the policy and legal framework related to the cybersecurity of IoT is evolving. For  instance, according to the European Commission work programme for 202213, released on 19  October 2021, a proposal on a European cybersecurity resilience act (legislative) will be  published in Q3 2022”14 and it will aim to “establish common cybersecurity standards for  products”15, whereas  products will likely include interconnected IoT devices.  13 https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/default/files/com2021_645_en.pdf  14 https://www.europarl.europa.eu/legislative-train/theme-a-europe-fit-for-the-digital-age/file-european-cyber-resilience-act  15 https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/default/files/com2021_645_en.pdf  https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/default/files/com2021_645_en.pdf https://www.europarl.europa.eu/legislative-train/theme-a-europe-fit-for-the-digital-age/file-european-cyber-resilience-act https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/default/files/com2021_645_en.pdf  EU CYBERSECURITY MARKET ANALYSIS  April 2022  13  2. MARKET STRUCTURE  2.1 INTRODUCTION TO THE MARKET STRUCTURE  The IoT cybersecurity market has experienced similar developments as those experienced by the wider  IT market, with cybersecurity considerations often being secondary to the development of novel  infrastructure (both hard- and software), rather than an integral of the development phases (i.e., “security  by design”). As illustrated by Figure 2, an analysis of IoT adoption barriers clearly indicates that security  is the top concern of most IoT decision makers.  Figure 2: Top technical barriers to IoT implementation success - % of respondents16  16 https://www.gartner.com/document/3863770?ref=solrAll&refval=302383200, [restricted] accessed 20 Sep 2021.  https://www.gartner.com/document/3863770?ref=solrAll&refval=302383200  EU CYBERSECURITY MARKET ANALYSIS  April 2022  14  The expected vulnerabilities resulting the swift IoT-adoption and the fast-changing threat landscape are  leading to growing levels of spending on IoT security products and services.  2.2 .RESEARCH QUESTIONS  According to ECSMAF7 (See Section 2.1.1 - ECSMAF, Version 1.0), the two main elements of  the market structure and segmentation are the determination of value chain at scope and the  determination corresponding value stack. The three analysis dimensions for these elements are  the market size, the market growth and the market geographical distribution.  The analysis of the market structure of IoT cybersecurity in distribution grids addresses the  following research questions:  1. What is the size and the geographical distribution of the IoT cybersecurity market in the  EU-27 distribution grids?  2. Is the demand for IoT devices growing in the EU-27 distribution grids?  3. Is the demand for IoT cybersecurity growing in the EU-27 distribution grids?  4. How is the cybersecurity expenditure distributed between key assets of the distribution  grids?  5. How is the split between OPEX and CAPEX?  2.3 KEY ASSETS OF THE ELECTRICITY GRIDS FROM AN IOT  PERSPECTIVE: SMART TRANSFORMERS AND SMART METERS  Before replying to the research questions, it is important to highlight that the key assets of  electricity grid in scope from an IoT perspective are mainly:  1. smart transformers; and  2. smart metres.  Table 1: Description of assets of the electricity grid in scope  Asset / device Description  Smart transformers  High/Medium voltage transformers with smart actuators that help grid operators to  manage voltage levels and regulate the active and reactive power levels of the  distribution grid.  Smart meters Measure electricity consumption/generation readings and communicate this  information to energy organisations and end-users.  EU CYBERSECURITY MARKET ANALYSIS  April 2022  15  Figure 3: Assets of the electricity grid in scope  Smart transformers and smart metres are the most vital assets from an IoT perspective; both  are prone to different threat vectors and their protection requires protection services, leading to  additional cybersecurity spending. Smart transformers and smart metres have been selected as  the key assets when analysing the value chain and value stack related to IoT cybersecurity in  distribution grids. Figure 3 depicts the interplay of the key assets within a smart-grid.  The value chain at scope includes smart transformers and smart metres-related cybersecurity  hardware and software. It must be noted that in this market analysis, only hardware or software  components that can be installed in IoT endpoints were considered. As such, other components  or segments - such as gateway security, network security, or security applications used to  manage IoT devices - were disregarded, as they were considered as part of the individual  enterprise architecture of utility companies. Another examples of value stack considered in this  analysis are the implementation services of cybersecurity solutions and cybersecurity operation  services related to smart transformers and smart metres.  Electrical switchgears and measurement devices (such as voltage sensors) are also normally  present in low- and mid-voltage distribution lines. However, they have not been considered as  part of the market structure and segmentation of this report. Also the IoT management and  integration elements (for example cloud integration and IoT services) - not related to the  implementation of cybersecurity solutions and cybersecurity operation - were not considered for  this analysis. Moreover, connectivity issues of the key assets are also not taken into account,  assuming that necessary utilities for their operation are part of the contingency plans of the  generic smart grid infrastructure (i.e. uninterrupted power supply, fall-back network connections,  etc.).  EU CYBERSECURITY MARKET ANALYSIS  April 2022  16  2.4 COVERED GEOGRAPHIES  In accordance with the geographical scope of this report, all EU Member States have been  considered.

The figures of Eurolectric18 were used to determine the number of installed MV/LV  (Medium voltage/low voltage) transformers in the EU-27 countries in 2013. The dataset  includes figures for all EU-27 countries except Croatia, Luxemburg, Malta, The  Netherlands, Slovakia and Sweden.  17 The countries are listed here in alphabetical order by country code.  18 https://www3.eurelectric.org/powerdistributionineurope/, accessed 20 Sep 2021.  https://www3.eurelectric.org/powerdistributionineurope/  EU CYBERSECURITY MARKET ANALYSIS  April 2022  17  2. The number of installed MV/LV transformers in the countries for which no public  information was obtained, is estimated on the assumption that the number of MV/LV  transformers is proportional to electricity consumption in those respective countries.  3. The CAGR (Compounded Annual Growth Rate)19 of electricity consumption in the EU- 27 between 2013 and 2018 was obtained. Since the EIA21 does not provide complete  electricity consumption data for the years 2019 and 2020, we use 2013 as a baseline  year and modelled the consumption growth based on available data points.  4. The number of installed MV/LV transformers between 2013 and 2030 is assumed to  grow according to the same CAGR as electricity consumption in the EU-27 countries  from 2013 to 2018. Electricity consumption data between 2018 and 2030 is assumed  to grow at the same rate as it did between 2013 and 2018. In consequence, we do not  account for potential factors that could accelerate electricity consumption in the future,  such as increased adoption of electric vehicles. We use assumption as a conservative  scenario to estimate the minimum number of endpoints/assets to be connected until  2030.  19 The compound annual growth rate (CAGR) is “the annualized average rate of revenue growth between two given years,  assuming growth takes place at an exponentially compounded rate” (from https://www.gartner.com/en/information- technology/glossary/cagr-compound-annual-growth-rate, accessed 1 February 2022).  https://www.gartner.com/en/information-technology/glossary/cagr-compound-annual-growth-rate

 EU CYBERSECURITY MARKET ANALYSIS  April 2022  19  2.5.1.2 Adoption of IoT devices in MV/LV transformers in the EU-27  There are two adoption rationales behind the inclusion of IoT devices in MV/LV transformers  as to respond to the growing trend of grid digitalisation, these being:  1. The adoption of new transformers with “smart” capabilities (e.g. remote operation,  data sharing with utilities’ control centres).  2. Upgrading existing MV/LV transformers to enable “smart” capabilities, which is often  referred to as retrofit solutions.  2.5.1.3 Adoption of IoT devices in MV/LV transformers in the EU-27 (new “smart”  transformers)  On the basis of market research, three drivers for the installation of new “smart” transformers  can be identified in the product portfolios of multiple asset providers (e.g. General Electric24)  in distribution grids:  1. MV/LV “smart” transformers that are installed to meet the growing demand for  transformers due to of electricity consumption growth: These are mainly assets  that are installed to cope with a growing electricity demand and/or network  expansion. This figure is calculated based on the projection illustrated by Table 3.  2. MV/LV “smart” transformers that are installed to substitute failing assets:  These are mainly assets that are installed to replace failing assets. A failure rate of  0.3% of the installed transformers per year is assumed, complemented by 36% of  transformers that cannot be economically fixed and need replacement.25  3. MV/LV “smart” transformers that are installed to substitute assets that have  arrived at the end of its lifespan: This is mainly equipment that has met its lifespan  and needs replacement. We assume an average lifespan of 35 years for a MV/LV  transformer.26  Finally, we assume that 25% of the newly installed transformers27 provide “smart” capabilities,  i.e., IoT devices. As such, Figure 4 shows the total number of new transformers with IoT  devices installed in the EU-27 per year, and a categorisation of the three different reasons for  their instalment, as explained above.  24 https://www.gegridsolutions.com/hvmv_equipment/catalog/power_transformers.htm, accessed 20 Sep 2021.  25 http://vlabs.iitkgp.ac.in/vhvlab/html/pages/CD/topics_a-h/G-026-TEN-F.pdf, accessed 20 Sep 2021.  26 https://www.powermag.com/clinging-to-power-why-extending-transformer-life-is- key/#:~:text=Under%20ideal%20conditions%2C%20transformers%20are, accessed 20 Sep 2021.  27 Internal estimation based on previous engagements.  https://www.gegridsolutions.com/hvmv_equipment/catalog/power_transformers.htm http://vlabs.iitkgp.ac.in/vhvlab/html/pages/CD/topics_a-h/G-026-TEN-F.pdf https://www.powermag.com/clinging-to-power-why-extending-transformer-life-is-key/#:%7E:text=Under%20ideal%20conditions%2C%20transformers%20are https://www.powermag.com/clinging-to-power-why-extending-transformer-life-is-key/#:%7E:text=Under%20ideal%20conditions%2C%20transformers%20are  EU CYBERSECURITY MARKET ANALYSIS  April 2022  20  Figure 4: Number of MV/LV transformers replaced in the EU 27 - Replacement reasons (%)  per FY28  2.5.1.4 Adoption of IoT devices in MV/LV transformers in EU-27 (retrofit solutions)  Retrofitting legacy MV/LV transformers represents another driver for the implementation of  IoT devices in the distribution grids of the EU-27. Although new equipment generally comes  with built-in sensors and IoT capabilities, the acquisition of an “edge” box with IoT  capabilities to retrofit standard transformer costs approximately 5% of the price of a new  MV/LV transformer with enabled IoT capabilities29 can be considered as reasonable.  Incentivised by the challenging targets set by the EU Renewable Energy Directive and the  critical enabling role of the smart grid to ensure the necessary inclusion of renewables in the  distribution grid,30 it is assumed that by 2030 approximately 50% of EU’s MV/LV  transformers will possess dedicated IoT capabilities.  Additionally, according to expert estimations for 2021, only 5% of MV/LV transformers  installed in EU-27 countries have “smart” capabilities. Based on observed ambition levels  and plans of leading grid operators, the following adoption of “smart” transformers is  expected.  28 Numbers resulted from the market model.  29 Estimation based on Gartner proprietary data.  30 https://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy15osti/63919.pdf, accessed 20 Sep 2021.  https://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy15osti/63919.pdf  EU CYBERSECURITY MARKET ANALYSIS  April 2022  21  Figure 5: Estimated adoption of retrofitted MV/LV transformers - Replacement reasons (%)  per FY  On the basis of the assumed penetration rate for “smart” MV/LV transformers, as illustrated  by Figure 5, and by subtracting the number of new transformers installed – indicated in Table  3 – the results of Figure 6 stand for the adoption of retrofitted transformers in the EU-27.  Figure 6: Number of retrofitted MV/LV transformers in EU 27  - Absolute values per FY  2.5.1.5 IoT cybersecurity spending in “smart” MV/LV transformers  IoT cybersecurity spending per “smart” MV/LV transformer is either a share of the total cost  for the acquisition of IoT device used for the retrofit or of the new transformer. On the basis  of Gartner research, the IoT cybersecurity spending of a standard IT device ranges from  10% to 20% of the total acquisition cost (CAPEX)31 of which 70% corresponds to security  hardware and 30% to installed licenses for security software. These observations are  illustrated in Table 4.  31 https://www.gartner.com/document/3863770?ref=solrAll&refval=302902311, [restricted] accessed 20 Sep 2021.  https://www.gartner.com/document/3863770?ref=solrAll&refval=302902311  EU CYBERSECURITY MARKET ANALYSIS  April 2022  22  Furthermore, the operational expenditure (OPEX) is derived from the maintenance of security  software installed in IoT devices (e.g. software patches), which are estimated to represent  20% of the total acquisition costs.32  Table 4: Estimated IoT cybersecurity spending data per “smart” transformer  Factor Value  Data Processing Unit (DPU) price retrofitted transformer CAPEX (€)33 600  DPU price new transformer CAPEX (€) 480  Cybersecurity related spending (% of CAPEX DPU price)  15%  HW security spending (% of total security spending)  70%  SW security spending (% of total security spending)  30%  SW maintenance spending (% of SW security spending)  20%  Figure 7 shows the estimated market size of IoT cybersecurity for “smart” MV/LV  transformers.

We follow a two-step approach to  estimate the number of smart electricity meters installed in the EU-27 in 2021:  1. We take the figures of European Commission34 for the estimated number of  installed “smart” meters in the EU-27 countries in 2020. According to the source,  there was an installed base of approx. 260 million “smart” electricity meters in  2020.  2. We then project that figure to 2030 assuming the installed base will grow at the  same CAGR as population35 grew from 2013 to 2021. We neglect the first three  years of the decade to compute the CAGR aiming to avoid a disproportionate  negative effect of the financial crisis of 2008, as it had a negative impact on  population growth.36  34 https://op.europa.eu/en/publication-detail/-/publication/b397ef73-698f-11ea-b735-01aa75ed71a1/language-en,  accessed 16 Nov 2021.  35 https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/population-demography/demography-population-stock-balance/database,  accessed 20 Sep 2021.  36 https://www.oecd.org/economy/growth/The-effect-of-the-global-financial-crisis-on-OECD-potential-output-OECD- Journal-Economic-Studies-2014.pdf, accessed 30 Sep 2021.  https://op.europa.eu/en/publication-detail/-/publication/b397ef73-698f-11ea-b735-01aa75ed71a1/language-en https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/population-demography/demography-population-stock-balance/database https://www.oecd.org/economy/growth/The-effect-of-the-global-financial-crisis-on-OECD-potential-output-OECD-Journal-Economic-Studies-2014.pdf https://www.oecd.org/economy/growth/The-effect-of-the-global-financial-crisis-on-OECD-potential-output-OECD-Journal-Economic-Studies-2014.pdf  EU CYBERSECURITY MARKET ANALYSIS  April 2022  24  As Figure 8 shows, it is only expected a modest growth in the number of metering points  due to the very low population growth in EU-27 from 2013 to 2020.  Figure 8: Number of metering points in EU 27 - In Millions  2.5.2.2 Adoption of electricity “smart” meters in EU-27  The rather hesitant adoption of “smart” meters due to inhibiting factors – like a low level of  awareness regarding their added-value – has resulted in a market penetration that is  significantly lower than projected by Electricity Directive 2009/72/EC. Especially in countries  like Germany, where the market demonstrates large potential, specific requirements often  remain unclear and keep “smart” meters from being adopted at full scale, resulting in the  roadmap being postponed till 2030.  Full penetration (~100%) seems unlikely to be reached by 2030 in the EU, due to the  general reluctance in the adoption of technology by consumers. As of today, only a few  countries – namely Sweden, Finland, Italy, Estonia, Malta, Spain and Denmark – have  already shown a wide-scale roll-out. Most countries will reach such a wide-scale roll-out (to  at least 80 % of the consumers) in the period 2022-2025. About one third of the Member  States will roll-out smart meters by 2030 or later, as their latest CBA is still negative.  Under the assumption of a baseline penetration of ~49% in 2021 (based on the figures  provided in the 2018 benchmarking of the European Commission37) we expect a  penetration level of ~92% in 2030. With the advent of 5G and overall increasing adoption  levels of “smart” infrastructure, significant growth in the adoption of “smart” meters is implied  as well. A penetration level of 92% by 2030 does, however, indicate mainstream adoption  and is likely to be followed by slower yet continuous adoption, closing the gap in the  following decade.  Based on empirical market behaviour, we employ an S-shaped curve to illustrate the  adoption progress.  37 https://op.europa.eu/en/publication-detail/-/publication/b397ef73-698f-11ea-b735-01aa75ed71a1/language-en,  accessed 16 Nov 2021.  https://op.europa.eu/en/publication-detail/-/publication/b397ef73-698f-11ea-b735-01aa75ed71a1/language-en  EU CYBERSECURITY MARKET ANALYSIS  April 2022  25  Figure 9: Penetration rate of “smart” meters in EU 27 - Penetration rate (%) of ‘smart’  electricity meters per FY\"  Using the projections of metering points and the penetration S-curve, we illustrate in Figure  10 the estimated number of “smart” electricity meters deployed in EU-27 from 2021 to 2030.  Figure 10: Number of deployed “smart” electricity meters in EU 27 - In Millions  2.5.2.3 IoT cybersecurity spending in “smart” electricity meters  We estimate IoT cybersecurity spending per “smart” electricity meter as a share of the total  cost for the acquisition of a unit.  According to a study prepared for DG-ENER,38 the cost per unit of a “smart” meter varies  significantly across EU countries (Table 5 below). These differences can result from several  38 https://ec.europa.eu/energy/sites/default/files/documents/AF%20Mercados%20NTUA%20CBA%20Annex%20  June%2015.pdf, accessed 20 Sep 2021.  https://ec.europa.eu/energy/sites/default/files/documents/AF%20Mercados%20NTUA%20CBA%20Annex%20June%2015.pdf https://ec.europa.eu/energy/sites/default/files/documents/AF%20Mercados%20NTUA%20CBA%20Annex%20June%2015.pdf  EU CYBERSECURITY MARKET ANALYSIS  April 2022  26  factors, such as the functionalities covered by the device (e.g. existence of a display) or the  contractual agreements between countries and manufacturers.

DEMAND-SIDE RESEARCH  3.1 INTRODUCTION TO THE DEMAND-SIDE RESEARCH SECTION  Increased global demand for energy and the resulting environmental implications are  causing a global disruption in electric utilities. The pressure to maintain physical integrity  and modernize aging infrastructure under changing climate conditions and  consumption/production patterns continues. Moreover, technology-driven disruption at the  grid edge continues to challenge existing energy provisioning business models and pose  new threats. This is thereby stimulating a radical change in the digital capabilities required  by organisations to ensure the secure and efficient operation of the grid, including the  partner-to-partner orchestration and the load management.  Figure 13: Increase of complexity in the electricity grid architecture41  IoT device adoption is at the heart of the digitalisation of the electric utilities industry.  Organisations are rapidly increasing the number of installed IoT devices in the grid to  monitor and operate an increasing number of geographically distributed assets (e.g.  renewable energy technologies) and to enable residential consumers to participate in  electricity markets, such as demand response or regulation markets (e.g. load curtailing).  3.2 RESEARCH QUESTIONS FOR THE DEMAND-SIDE  The analysis of the demand-side addresses the questions:  41 https://www.gartner.com/document/3987468?ref=solrAll&refval=300909192, accessed 20 Sep 2021.  https://www.gartner.com/document/3987468?ref=solrAll&refval=300909192  EU CYBERSECURITY MARKET ANALYSIS  April 2022  30  1) Which are the main trends in the demand of IoT cybersecurity in the distribution  grids?  2) Which drivers can be identified for IoT cybersecurity adoption in the distribution  grids?  3.3 METHODOLOGY OF THE DEMAND-SIDE RESEARCH  The analysis of the demand-side of the IoT cybersecurity market is performed by taking into  account the trends and the key reasons for consumers of IoT cybersecurity (e.g. utilities) to  purchase IoT cybersecurity services or products; in other words to assume provision of  Hardware and Software, Distribution (of hardware and software), but also advisory &  consulting, Implementation services, managed services, and R&D and education, which are  all elements of the value stack42 for this market segment.  3.4 MARKET TRENDS ON THE DEMAND-SIDE  With widespread IoT deployments across grids and consumption points, it remains a  fundamental issue for many organisations to better assess the risk exposure of IoT devices.  As a result, the demand for cybersecurity tools and services aimed at improving IoT  cybersecurity capabilities of organisations will be increasing in the energy industry43; the  global demand for IoT cybersecurity in the energy industry is expected to grow with a 19.4%  Compounded Annual Growth Rate between 2018 and 2024.  According to a global survey conducted by IBM44, organisations identify the following IoT  cybersecurity threats as the top drivers to invest in IoT cybersecurity (see Figure 14). Given  that the utilities industry is dominated by large players with multinational presence (e.g.  Iberdrola, a Spanish utility, has presence in Europe, North and South America), we assume  that the results of this survey apply as well to utilities operating in the EU.  42 See Section 2.2.2 - Cybersecurity market taxonomy, ECSMAF Version 1.0,  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/market-analysis-framework  43 https://www.gartner.com/document/3981757?ref=solrAll&refval=300973953, accessed 20 Sep 2021.  44 Source: IBM Institute for Business Value benchmark study, 2018.  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/market-analysis-framework https://www.gartner.com/document/3981757?ref=solrAll&refval=300973953  EU CYBERSECURITY MARKET ANALYSIS  April 2022  31  Figure 14: Key drivers of IoT security demand vs. growth in utilities - In percentage (%)44  Players on the demand side look for cybersecurity solutions to respond to threats, including  those described below:  Exposure of sensitive/confidential data  As organisations in the energy value chain digitalise grid assets – such as wires,  substations, transformers and other field equipment with IoT technologies – IoT devices and  edge gateways become potential entry-points for cyberattacks that can target sensitive or  confidential data.  For example, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) reported in 201845 that the  Dragonfly espionage group — a group formed by cyberterrorists — accessed the Human  Machine Interfaces (HMI) that control processes at several North American power  generation utilities. While inside the system, the group copied configuration information and  gained the potential to sabotage or take control of the facilities.  45 https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ncas/alerts/TA18-074A, accessed December 2021.  https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ncas/alerts/TA18-074A  EU CYBERSECURITY MARKET ANALYSIS  April 2022  32  Production disruptions/shutdowns resulting from sabotage  According to Gartner, 70% of security products deployed by asset-intensive organisations  will stretch capabilities across converging IT/OT/IoT requirements by 2023, aligning to new  cyber-physical system (CPS) security approaches.46  The increasing interdependencies between IT and OT (e.g. physical assets such as  transformers) create high stakes for security officers. A disruption of one part of this  interdependent devices could very well affect other parts of the infrastructure. At worst,  consequences could include a loss of power, the destruction of equipment and damage to  devices throughout the grid. For example, a cyberattack targeting smart inverters that  control home solar systems’ “selling back” power to the grid, could overload parts of the  grid, thus damaging critical equipment and/or causing power outages.  Figure 15: IT, OT and IoT convergence  Damage to organization’s reputation/loss of public confidence  Over the last 10 years, the impact of data breaches has increased exponentially. Data  breaches not only result in direct financial costs for organisations in the form of legal  expenses and technology investments for increased data security, but also in large indirect  costs (i.e. lost customer relationships and decline in new business due to a drop in public  sentiment about the company).  46 https://www.gartner.com/document/3981757?ref=solrAll&refval=300591351, accessed 20 Sep 2021.  https://www.gartner.com/document/3981757?ref=solrAll&refval=300591351  EU CYBERSECURITY MARKET ANALYSIS  April 2022  33  Figure 16: Public sentiment index before and after security attack47  For example, to analyse the impact of data breaches on organisations’ reputation or brand  image, Gartner profiled 15 organisations that had experienced some of the biggest data  breaches between 2012 and 2018.48 A daily public sentiment index score was calculated for  each organisation and then aggregated to arrive at the average public sentiment index trend  line for an effected organization.  This analysis resulted in the following observations:   The average daily public sentiment index for four weeks before an incident is  slightly positive at 107 (100 equals neutral).   On day zero (the day the data breach is publicly announced), the public sentiment  index fell by 18%.   The average daily public sentiment index for four weeks after the incident is 7%  lower than the average index value for four weeks before the incident.   In the four weeks after day zero, the number of posts about an effected  organization increases by 30%.   The public sentiment index has a significant and positive correlation with stock  prices.  Violation of regulatory requirements/potential fines  The electricity system has always attracted the attention of regulators given its criticality for  macro-economic buoyance and social welfare. The upsurge in the number of cyberattacks  targeting OT that constitute part of national critical infrastructures during the last years, have  only exacerbated regulators’ interest in cybersecurity.  47 https://www.gartner.com/document/3945879?ref=solrResearch&refval=300698617, accessed 20 Sep 2021.  48 https://technologymagazine.com/cloud-and-cybersecurity/honeywell-and-microsoft-partner-industrial-cloud,  accessed 20 Sep 2021.  https://www.gartner.com/document/3945879?ref=solrResearch&refval=300698617 https://technologymagazine.com/cloud-and-cybersecurity/honeywell-and-microsoft-partner-industrial-cloud  EU CYBERSECURITY MARKET ANALYSIS  April 2022  34  Figure 17: Operational technology attacks trends - Monthly OT attack volume, comparing  the year 2016-2019 (Source: IBM X-Force)49  In recent years, the EU has made significant policy developments to enforce and harmonize  security requirements in critical infrastructures — the electricity grid being one of them —  across member countries.  In the Proposal for a Directive on measures for a high common level of cybersecurity across  the Union, repealing the current NIS Directive50, the European Commission has proposed  that energy, transport and financial organisations, as well as digital providers and makers of  medical and computer devices could be fined up to 2% of their global turnover for breaching  EU security rules under a European Commission proposal.51  Damage to equipment resulting from manipulation or physical events  The electric utilities sector is an asset intensive industry — i.e., an industry that requires  above average levels of capital to operate. Operating and maintaining grid assets presents  many challenges for organisations, ranging from optimizing grid operation to mitigating the  impact of unpredictable weather events. Poor management of these processes can result in  increased costs and reduced profitability over long periods of time.  Over the last decade, organisations have been faced with an unprecedented risk for the  secure operation of their grid assets, namely cybersecurity threats. Without adequate  security considerations, grid assets such as solar panels or windfarms, could thus become  the perfect target for hackers. For example, approximately thirty substations were  disconnected from the network in Ukraine in 2015. The cyberattack left eight provinces  without electricity for several hours, more than 200000 people affected, controls systems  49 https://www.muycomputerpro.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/ibm-x-force-threat-intelligence-index-2020.pdf,  accessed 20 Sep 2021.  50 See https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/ALL/?uri=COM:2020:823:FIN , accessed 12 December 2021.

Although cyberattackers’  attention has traditionally been focused on enterprise IT systems, malicious attention is now  increasingly turning to control systems.  Cyberattacks to control systems not only endanger the safety of energy assets, but also the  lives of individuals and workers. For example, a cyberattack in 1999 to the control systems  of a gas pipeline resulted in three deaths and eight injured after malicious actors caused the  pipeline to rupture near Bellingham, Washington, flooding two local creeks with 237,000  gallons of gasoline.  Potential for environmental harm/disaster  IoT devices also pose a pollution liability risk. In the event malicious access to the control  systems that manage the operation of grid or generation assets, significant environmental  damage can be caused by the adversary.  For example, an employee laid off by Chevron, an oil company, deactivated the company's  incident alert system by hacking into the computers in charge of the system. The intrusion  was only discovered when an emergency occurred at a Chevron refinery in Richmond which  exposed thousands of people living in proximity to toxic substance for several hours.53  Reduced visibility and control due to the complexity of IT systems being connected  to OT systems  According to Forrester, 82% of organisations are not able to identify all the devices  connected to their network54 and this problem is only expected to grow. Utilities are the  industry that use highest number of IoT endpoints, totalling 1.17 billion endpoints in 2019,  and increasing by 17% in 2020 to reach 1.37 billion endpoints55 (mainly driven by  widespread adoption of smart meters).  The key issue for organisations with these vulnerable IoT endpoints is that they may  become access points for cyber attackers, even without realising such security breach has  occurred.  For example, a recent security research at a wind-turbine farm indicated that physical  vulnerabilities and a lack of network security allowed researchers to traverse the entire wind  farm’s network within minutes. They have identified misconfiguration of access privileges  that would have enabled them to cause revenue losses of anywhere from $10,000 to  $30,000 per hour or even destroy the turbines entirely.56  52 https://ecs-org.eu/documents/publications/5fdb2673903c6.pdf, accessed 20 Sep 2021.  53 https://ecs-org.eu/documents/publications/5fdb2673903c6.pdf, accessed 20 Sep 2021.  54 https://www.csoonline.com/article/3262968/eliminate-the-iot-security-blind-spot.html, accessed 20 Sep 2021.  55 https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2019-08-29-gartner-says-5-8-billion-enterprise-and- automotive-io, accessed 20 Sep 2021.  56 https://www.blackhat.com/docs/us-17/wednesday/us-17-Staggs-Adventures-In-Attacking-Wind-Farm-Control- Networks.pdf, accessed 20 Sep 2021.  https://ecs-org.eu/documents/publications/5fdb2673903c6.pdf https://ecs-org.eu/documents/publications/5fdb2673903c6.pdf https://www.csoonline.com/article/3262968/eliminate-the-iot-security-blind-spot.html https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2019-08-29-gartner-says-5-8-billion-enterprise-and-automotive-io https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2019-08-29-gartner-says-5-8-billion-enterprise-and-automotive-io https://www.blackhat.com/docs/us-17/wednesday/us-17-Staggs-Adventures-In-Attacking-Wind-Farm-Control-Networks.pdf https://www.blackhat.com/docs/us-17/wednesday/us-17-Staggs-Adventures-In-Attacking-Wind-Farm-Control-Networks.pdf  EU CYBERSECURITY MARKET ANALYSIS  April 2022  36  Intellectual property theft  Beyond the theft of customer data, regulatory fines and reputational damage are other less- obvious costs for organisations that may result from cyberattacks. The theft of intellectual  property (IP) is an example hereto.  For example, in 2011 Night Dragon, a series of cyber-attacks, stole confidential information  from large oil players. The list of affected organisations included big, traditional players of  this industry, such as Exxon Mobil, Royal Dutch Shell and BP. The cyber-attacks took  gigabytes of highly sensitive internal documents, including proprietary information about oil-  and gas-field operations, project financing, and bidding documents.57  Additional user requirements  It must be noted, than this analysis of trends and drivers should not be considered as  exhaustive. The trends and drivers mentioned in this Chapter are only those that more  clearly emerged from the analysis conducted for this PoC, which, as explained earlier in this  report, was based mainly on already available data. By focusing on cybersecurity, this  analysis did not specifically focus on data protection. Additional primary research (i.e.  surveys) could lead to the identification of additional trends and drivers on the demand side,  regarding specifically privacy issues. This is particularly relevant, given the variation of  privacy requirements among various states at international level.  Besides cybersecurity solutions to respond to the above threats, some best practices for  cyber-security and privacy of the smart metering systems58 together with cybersecurity  baseline requirements have been developed by relevant associations59. One can assume  that the implementation of such good practices helps reducing the exposure to the threats  considered in this chapter.  57 https://isssource.com/%E2%80%98night-dragon%E2%80%99-cyber-attacks-big-oil/, accessed 20 Sep 2021.  58 2012/148/EU: Commission Recommendation of 9 March 2012 on preparations for the roll-out of smart metering  systems, https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/ALL/?uri=celex:32012H0148 , accessed 1 February 2022, and  European Commission, Best Available Techniques Reference Document for the cyber-security and privacy of the 10  minimum functional requirements of the Smart Metering Systems,  https://ec.europa.eu/energy/sites/ener/files/documents/bat_wp4_bref_smart-metering_systems_final_deliverable.pdf ,  accessed 1 February 2022.  59 Such as the European Smart Metering Infrastructure Group (ESMIG), and the European Network for Cybersecurity  (ENCS) together with the European Distribution System Operators (E.DSO).  https://isssource.com/%E2%80%98night-dragon%E2%80%99-cyber-attacks-big-oil/ https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/ALL/?uri=celex:32012H0148 https://ec.europa.eu/energy/sites/ener/files/documents/bat_wp4_bref_smart-metering_systems_final_deliverable.pdf  EU CYBERSECURITY MARKET ANALYSIS  April 2022  37  4.

Which are the main trends on the supply-side?  4.3 METHODOLOGY OF THE SUPPLY-SIDE ANALYSIS  The analysis of the supply-side of the IoT cybersecurity market in distribution electricity  grids is structured in two different parts:  1. Analysis of key trends and competitive behaviours of key archetypes of suppliers  of IoT cybersecurity solutions or services.  2. Competitive profiles of selected vendors/suppliers of IoT cybersecurity  solutions/products.  It is important to highlight that the list of representative vendors below is not  exhaustive and more companies might be taken into account from the supply side.  The objective of this section is not to provide an exhaustive list of market players for  each archetype, but rather to analyse key trends emerging in the supply-side of the  IoT cybersecurity market. Due to resource constraints, the selection of vendors in  this analysis was based only on available data sources.  The selection of representative vendors was based on industry experts’ opinions,  estimated revenue sizes and product innovation approaches provided by Gartner.  4.4 ARCHETYPES OF SUPPLIERS  Four different archetypes of suppliers/vendors of IoT cybersecurity solutions or services  have been identified in the IoT cybersecurity market:  EU CYBERSECURITY MARKET ANALYSIS  April 2022  38  1. Multi-domain industrial assets vendors: Covers traditional vendors of assets,  equipment and OT systems that have expanded their market portfolio towards  digitalised solutions and services.  2. Multi-domain IT vendors: Covers large providers of IT solutions and/or services  that have expanded their offerings into the IoT cybersecurity market.  3. Specialist IoT vendors: Covers vendors of IoT solutions looking to complement  the capabilities of their IoT solutions with IoT cybersecurity capabilities.  4. IoT cybersecurity specialist vendors: Covers market vendors in IoT cybersecurity  that first entered the market with dedicated IoT cybersecurity offerings.  4.4.1 Multi-domain industrial assets vendors  Multi-domain industrial assets vendors are established operations technology original equipment  manufacturers (OT OEMs) with decades of experience in industrial control and automation  systems, machine-to-machine, as well as supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA)  solutions. These vendors tend to cover a wide spectrum of IoT components and are capable to  satisfy diverse requirements of large clients across markets and regions. Some of these vendors  have already recognised the need to digitalize their core business and are actively adding digital  capabilities to the industrial services and assets that they traditionally supply. While they may lag  behind other players (e.g. Multi-domain IT vendors) with respect to digital capabilities, they often  have a better understanding of the operational requirements of vertical industries due to their  long-standing relation as providers of industrial assets and O&M services. For example General  Electric, a large North American industrial group, launched GE Digital in 2015. This company  segment is specialised in software and IT services for industrial players, such as security  managed IT services or predictive maintenance software.60  60 https://www.ge.com/digital/, accessed 20 Sep 2021.  https://www.ge.com/digital/  EU CYBERSECURITY MARKET ANALYSIS  April 2022  39  Figure 18: Overview of the functional capabilities of some representative multi-domain industrial assets vendors  EU CYBERSECURITY MARKET ANALYSIS  April 2022  40  Figure 19: Overview of cybersecurity capabilities of some representative multi-domain industrial assets vendors  4.4.2 Multi-domain IT vendors  Multi-domain IT vendors are traditional IT giants that approach IoT from their position of strength in enterprise software infrastructure, applications, and  analytics. As such, these vendors see IoT as a logical extension and growth opportunity of their existing IT customer base. They tend to specialize in IoT  management, either by providing data-acquisition, connectivity, infrastructure, or data integration platforms.  EU CYBERSECURITY MARKET ANALYSIS  April 2022  41  While these vendors have a good understanding of the IT requirements of industrial actors, they tend not to focus on providing customised solutions that  address the different operational requirements of vertical industries. Most of these vendors are relatively new to the IoT market and are trying to build up IoT  capabilities by means of acquisitions of smaller vendors with higher specialisation in the IoT market.  Figure 20: Overview of functional capabilities of some multi-IT vendors  Whereas IT, OT and IoT environments gradually converge, multi-domain IT vendors are pursuing combined security offerings that provide a single point of  governance for the entire security functions within an organisation. Several of these vendors are oriented towards strategic acquisitions to reinforce their IoT  cybersecurity capabilities and set up specialised teams.  EU CYBERSECURITY MARKET ANALYSIS  April 2022  42  Figure 21: Overview of cybersecurity capabilities of some representative multi-domain IT vendors  EU CYBERSECURITY MARKET ANALYSIS  April 2022  43  4.4.3 Specialist IoT vendors  There are hundreds of smaller IoT providers, many of which focus on niche areas (e.g. based on vertical industry, use cases, horizontal value or geography,  etc.), with most having a more generic technology focus. For some, lower scale and limited resources combined with few to no differentiating capabilities, may  ultimately lead to low market recognition and slow revenue growth.  Figure 22: Overview of functional capabilities of some representative specialist IoT vendors  EU CYBERSECURITY MARKET ANALYSIS  April 2022  44  Some of the specialist IoT vendors may lack advanced IoT cybersecurity controls and reference primarily the functional capabilities of their products.  Nevertheless, due to regulatory progress in IoT/OT cybersecurity (e.g. IEC 62443 regulation) and increasing sophistication of the security practices of  large organisations, the requirement to adhere to IoT cybersecurity standards becomes essential (e.g. regarding Identity and Access management).  This is especially the case for those generating a significant portion of their revenues with large organisations.  Some vendors that could be categorised under this archetype, have decided to host their products in public cloud platforms (e.g. Microsoft Azure, Amazon  Web Services, Google Cloud) in order to take advantage of the advanced cloud controls available in these platforms.  Figure 23: Overview of cybersecurity capabilities of some representative specialist IoT vendors  EU CYBERSECURITY MARKET ANALYSIS  April 2022  45  4.4.4 IoT Cybersecurity specialist vendors  IoT Security specialist vendors are usually smaller players, especially when compared to large Multi-domain IT vendors. They tend to specialize in niche  IoT security markets or focus on developing innovative solutions to solve concrete IoT requirements, while enabling ease of integration with other IoT or  OT security platforms provided by larger players. IoT Security Specialist vendors are frequently targeted by acquisitions of larger players, in particular  due to their innovative IP in security solutions.  Figure 24: Overview of cybersecurity capabilities of some representative IoT cybersecurity specialist vendors  EU CYBERSECURITY MARKET ANALYSIS  April 2022  46  4.5 PROFILES OF REPRESENTATIVE MARKET PLAYERS  IoT vendors need to ensure differentiation from their competitors, in an environment dominated  by customer’s attention and revenue.

Table 7: Vendors covered in the supply-side analysis89  Archetype of  supplier Vendor Headquarters Ownership90  Multi-domain  Industrial Assets  Siemens Germany Publicly listed  Schneider France Publicly listed  Hitachi ABB  Power Grid  and Hitachi  Japan Publicly listed  ABB Switzerland Publicly listed  General  Electric United States Publicly listed  Multidomain IT  Atos France Publicly listed  Cisco United States Publicly listed  HCL India  Publicly listed  Oracle United States Publicly listed  Microsoft United States Publicly listed  IoT Specialists  Telit UK Publicly listed  Landis Gyr Switzerland Publicly listed  Cloud Plugs United States Private  Aclara United States Private  Rayven Australia  Publicly listed  IoT Cybersecurity  Specialist vendors  Infineon Germany Private  Mocana United States Private  Radiflow Israel Publicly listed  Nozomi  Networks United States Private  Cujo AI United States Private  4.7 MARKET TRENDS ON THE SUPPLY-SIDE  From the analysis of the different vendor archetypes as well as the functional areas in which they have  strong or partial capabilities, the following market trends from a capability perspective were defined:   Multi-domain industrial asset vendors tend to have a broad and solid market offering  when it comes to the provision of “smart” assets or equipment. While most of them have  a reasonably digitalised product portfolio, their IoT management products may fall behind  those of multi-domain IT vendors.   Multi-domain IT vendors usually have strong capabilities in those areas where it is  critical to collect, manage, and present the data gathered by “smart” devices.   IoT specialist vendors usually have targeted but less sophisticated capabilities,  covering operational safety and regulatory requirements, as they tend to require lower  levels of capital to develop.  89 Information obtained from vendor’s websites.  90 Publicly listed companies are companies whose ownership is organized via shares of stock which are intended to be  freely traded on a stock exchange or in over-the-counter markets.  EU CYBERSECURITY MARKET ANALYSIS  April 2022  51  Figure 25: Summary of functional capabilities of vendor archetypes  Furthermore, on the basis of an assessment of the cybersecurity areas where the considered  vendor archetypes have strong or partial capabilities, the following market trends from a security  perspective were defined:   Multi-domain industrial asset vendors tend to show untapped potential with respect to  their IoT cybersecurity. Many have gained further cybersecurity capabilities in the last years  by means of acquisitions but are still working on integrating them into holistic market offerings.   Multi-domain IT vendors tend to have strong IoT cybersecurity capabilities in most of  the areas because of their long-standing position in multiple IT market segments.   Specialist IoT vendors tend to offer limited cybersecurity capabilities in most IoT  cybersecurity areas because of their traditional lack of focus on IoT cybersecurity.   IoT cybersecurity specialist vendors tend to specialize in those IoT cybersecurity  market segments not targeted by larger vendors. They have emerged in developing  market segments where they leverage innovative technologies to ensure differentiation.  Figure 26: Summary of cybersecurity capabilities of vendor archetypes  EU CYBERSECURITY MARKET ANALYSIS  April 2022  52  In addition, when focusing on IoT, there is a clear distinction from the trends seen within IT,  where there is a varied and crowded stand-alone cybersecurity marketplace. With IoT, this is  unlikely to happen due to the requirements and limitations of deploying software in many IoT  environments. As such, embedded cybersecurity has been observed as a preferable option  here. As a result, it is expected that – despite a relatively small number of successful stand- alone cybersecurity product providers exploiting current cybersecurity gaps – in the medium to  long term, IoT infrastructure and platforms will increasingly embed required cybersecurity  features at the endpoint or as part of the networking infrastructure.  Traditional IT security vendors are exploiting this trend by making their data interoperable with  multiple, potentially available IT security solutions – e.g. Security Operations Centres (SOCs),  ticketing systems, or security orchestration. In this manner, compatibility with existing security  solutions and products can be achieved. The modularity angle associated with platform-based  features and functionalities is attractive to end-users, who can adapt them based on their  current security infrastructure, needs and maturity.  The platform business model also implies that vendors can increasingly offer pricing models  based on software-as-a-service and provide more cloud-based and analytics-centric solutions.  Some vendors now offer both, passive on-premises solutions for brownfield systems (e.g.  already installed grid assets), as well as active, cloud-based solutions for greenfield systems.  The rise of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) technologies has also spurred  the emergence of smaller players with solutions to fulfil concrete cybersecurity requirements  with innovative approaches that are often easier to deploy. They may address evolving needs  and requirements of utilities that can be integrated in the utilities’ existing operations technology  (OT) security platforms.  Traditional vendors of electricity grid assets (e.g. transformers) are also present in the IoT  cybersecurity market. They have progressed in the digitalisation of their legacy offerings and  came to realize the business opportunity in bundling IoT cybersecurity solutions and services  that reach across their assets, OT and IoT commercial offerings. A selection of vendors in that  space tends to offer a high degree of specialisation in the utilities industry, which often has  unique cybersecurity needs due to the types of systems and protocols deployed, unique sales  cycles, or safety and security requirements.  Finally, the IoT cybersecurity market also includes vendors that are specialised in functional  components, such as IoT connectivity solutions or smart metering devices. Although the IoT  cybersecurity segment does not necessarily represent a core market for these vendors, they are  increasingly adding IoT cybersecurity features to their products in order to address the growing  concern of utilities with cybersecurity threats.  EU CYBERSECURITY MARKET ANALYSIS  April 2022  53  5. TECHNOLOGY RESEARCH  5.1 INTRODUCTION TO THE TECHNOLOGY RESEARCH SECTION  The digital transformation in the utilities industry goes hand-in-hand with an increasing number  of data sources, systems, and interconnected assets of various kinds. Ultimately, the  connectivity of endpoints with modern, open network technologies and IoT platforms is the  foundation of the digitalisation of the utilities industry.  Consequentially, electricity grids are becoming less isolated from outside networks due to the  need to:  • coordinate decentralised, intermittent, and non-dispatchable generation assets (e.g.  renewable energy sources),  • manage the growing penetration of distributed energy resources (e.g. Photovoltaic  Panels) installed at consumption endpoints and,  • manage the evolving role of consumers as active market players (e.g. demand  response, generation, storage).  Less isolation and more integration require a different approach to cybersecurity where “trust  levels” of different types, with very strict levels of what each entity might be able to do, play a  key role.  At the heart of this change is the demand to integrate enterprise IT systems in order to digitalise  organisations for remote connectivity to improve operations, automation and lower operation  costs. However, as legacy systems and grid assets (e.g. transformers) evolve toward more- connected systems, their cybersecurity posture is increasingly challenged.  The use of IoT technologies has unique safety, business continuity and physical security  implications. As attack surface increases due to the increasing number of connected devices,  the need to address physical threats and cyberthreats will lead to the adoption of emerging  technologies to address an array of environments spanning across the utilities industry (i.e.  cyber-physical systems).  5.2 RESEARCH QUESTIONS ON TECHNOLOGY  The technology research analysis addresses the question on which key technological trends  regarding IoT cybersecurity are noticeable within distribution grids.  5.3 METHODOLOGY OF TECHNOLOGY ANALYSIS  This report examines technology trends in IoT cybersecurity in context of the electricity  distribution grids. The technology analysis addresses the following research questions:  1. Which are the (main) technology trends that are perceived in the market?  2. When these trends are expected to have a significant impact on the market?  3. What impact these trends will have on relevant markets?  Time to impact or “range” is measured in the years to early majority adoption. This is when  technology adoption is “ready for prime time.” It is important to point out that the time to  technology impact or range is not the same as the time to act on the technology. When and how  product leaders should act depends on the company’s business strategy. Providers that want to  EU CYBERSECURITY MARKET ANALYSIS  April 2022  54  be “first movers” with an emerging technology trend, will need to act far sooner than those that  are comfortable with waiting for their competition to compel them into action.  The “mass” component examines the extent of the impact on existing products and markets. To  assess how massive the impact is, two main aspects – breadth and depth – are taken into  consideration. The breadth of impact refers to how many sectors are affected (i.e. products,  services, markets, business functions, industries, and geographies). The depth of the impact  includes an analysis of the potential disruption to existing products, services, and markets.  Due to the global nature of technology research and innovation, we assume that global  technology trends in IoT cybersecurity correspond with those present in the EU.  5.4 IOT CYBERSECURITY TECHNOLOGY TRENDS IN DISTRIBUTION  GRIDS  The subsequent technology trends in IoT cybersecurity have been identified as relevant within  the context of this report:  1. Cyber-physical system security;  2. Operational Technology security;  3. Positioning, Navigation, and Timing (PNT) security;  4. Digital Risk Protection Services, and  5. Homomorphic Encryption.  In the figure below, five different technology thrends are positioned in an impact radar according  to Gartner’s analysis.91  Figure 27: Impact radar of emerging technology trends in IoT cybersecurity  91 https://www.gartner.com/document/3981757?ref=solrAll&refval=300973953, accessed 20 Sep 2021.  https://www.gartner.com/document/3981757?ref=solrAll&refval=300973953  EU CYBERSECURITY MARKET ANALYSIS  April 2022  55  5.4.1 Cyber-physical system security  Cyber-physical systems (CPS) are defined as engineered systems that orchestrate sensing,  computation, control, networking, and analytics to interact with the physical world (including  humans). As such, they enable safe, real-time, secure, reliable, resilient, and adaptable grid  operation.  CPS in distribution grids is emerging through the convergence of IT, OT and ET systems,  through increased use of IoT-like sensors (e.g. voltage meters) in the grid, through remotely  controlled or maintained systems or via deployment of new algorithms and automation  solutions.  The need for a comprehensive and coordinated security approach will require organisations to  deploy cyber-physical systems solutions that cover the entire cyber-physical risk spectrum.  The product capabilities will range across the spectrum of an adaptive security model, from  prevention tools (such as network firewalling and endpoint security tools), to detection  mechanisms (such as system monitoring and inventorying) and predictive solutions (like threat  intelligence).  Emerging CPS security use-cases, in which controls apply across IT, IoT, OT and physical  environments, include:   Real-time visibility and asset discovery for every asset connected to enterprise  networks, regardless of where they reside, and whether they are managed by  engineering, operations or IT;92   Managed detection and response (MDR) and incident response (IR) services;93   Best-of-breed approaches to threat intelligence and vulnerability management that  consider the uniqueness of OT environments in combination with IT security principle.  5.4.1.1 Range: Now  CPS-Sec technology has become a critical area of focus for utilities and grid operators. This is  due to the increased number of threat vectors targeting utilities, such as the Snake/EKANS  ransomware, which has successfully impacted several organisations such as Enel,94 in 2020.  According to Gartner, 50% of security products and services marketed today as “Internet of  Things (IoT)” will focus on industry-specific CPS-Sec needs by 2023, compared with a negligible  number today.95  5.4.1.2 Mass: Medium  The overall mass for CPS-Sec is estimated to be medium.96 As organisations continue to  automate and connect assets to drive increased productivity, CPS will continue to deploy.  5.4.2 Operational Technology security  OT security is the practice of protecting critical production and operational systems and services  in asset-centric enterprises, such as the utilities industry. As the OT market moves toward more- connected systems and newly designed “greenfield” systems (e.g. connected transformers), the  traditional OT management, governance, infrastructure and security become part of a broader  security effort defined that becomes intertwined with IoT and IT security.  92 https://www.gartner.com/document/3991219?ref=authbottomrec&refval=4001838 , [restricted] accessed 20 Sep 2021,  93 https://www.gartner.com/document/3981757?ref=solrAll&refval=300973953, accessed 20 Sep 2021.  94 https://blog.malwarebytes.com/threat-analysis/2020/06/honda-and-enel-impacted-by-cyber-attack-suspected-to-be- ransomware/, accessed 20 Sep 2021.  95 https://www.gartner.com/document/3981757?ref=solrAll&refval=300973953, accessed 20 Sep 2021.  96 https://www.gartner.com/document/3981757?ref=solrAll&refval=300973953, accessed 20 Sep 2021.  https://securityboulevard.com/2020/06/ekans-strikes-again-honda-and-enel-taken-down-by-ransomware/ https://www.gartner.com/document/3991219?ref=authbottomrec&refval=4001838 https://www.gartner.com/document/3981757?ref=solrAll&refval=300973953 https://blog.malwarebytes.com/threat-analysis/2020/06/honda-and-enel-impacted-by-cyber-attack-suspected-to-be-ransomware/ https://blog.malwarebytes.com/threat-analysis/2020/06/honda-and-enel-impacted-by-cyber-attack-suspected-to-be-ransomware/ https://www.gartner.com/document/3981757?ref=solrAll&refval=300973953 https://www.gartner.com/document/3981757?ref=solrAll&refval=300973953  EU CYBERSECURITY MARKET ANALYSIS  April 2022  56  5.4.2.1 Range: Now  OT security has become a critical area of focus for utilities. Trying to protect critical  infrastructures, along with trying to preserve safety and reliability at a time when digital  transformation and the need to automate business operations is presenting new risks.  This progress has been driven by fast growth and adoption rates, with an estimated CAGR of  36% from 2021 to 2022.97 This growth has been supported by a diverse number of use-cases,  such as smart-grid implementations where advanced data sharing capabilities between utilities’  operation and planning IT systems with OT are required.  5.4.2.2 Mass: Medium  OT security’s impact on existing products and markets is expected to be medium. Network  security equipment, vulnerability management, endpoint security and professional services are  among the most impacted markets where providers are looking to expand capabilities to meet  rising demand.  According to Gartner,98 as utilities’ maturity in OT security increases an increasing number of IT  security activities and controls will be applied to OT environments. This trend is expected to  accelerate the interest of established IT services/security in this market, and perhaps drive  consolidation, i.e., reduction of the number of market players in the market as a result of larger  players acquiring smaller, OT-specialised market players.  For example, Atos, a French provider of IT services, recently acquired Cryptovision in order to  strengthen its security product line.  5.4.3 Positioning, Navigation, and Timing (PNT) security  Positioning, navigation, and timing (PNT) is a combination of three capabilities:   Positioning, which is the ability to determine location and orientation accurately and  precisely;   Navigation, which is the ability to determine current and desired position, correct  course, orientation, and speed to attain a desired position anywhere around the world,  and   Timing, which is the ability to acquire and maintain accurate and precise time from a  standard (Coordinated Universal Time, or UTC), anywhere in the world.  PNT is provided by Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSSs), such as the Global  Positioning System (GPS), Galileo, GLONASS and BeiDou Navigation Satellite System. The  most widely used PNT service is GPS.  Information on positioning, if not properly protected, might expose the power grids, e.g. thus  becoming the target of a drone attack. In addition, GPS equipment, as a source of precision  timing, is vulnerable to different forms of deliberate attack, as well as unintentional  compromises99. GPS is used by many applications deployed to manage grid operations in the  electricity subsector, leading thus to materialization of risks to operations, if GPS accuracy is  compromised.  Top electricity distribution applications for precision timing include Sequence of Events  (SOE)/Digital Fault Recorders (DFR), protective relays, synchro-phasor measurements, and  97 https://www.gartner.com/document/code/352921?ref=authbody&refval=3991219, accessed 20 Sep 2021.  98 https://www.gartner.com/document/3981757?ref=solrAll&refval=300973953, accessed 20 Sep 2021.  99 For an analysis on threats against energy providers’ services see the ENISA report on ‘Power Sector Dependency on  Time Service: attacks against time sensitive services’, https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/power-sector-dependency,  accessed 17 January 2022.  https://www.gartner.com/document/code/352921?ref=authbody&refval=3991219 https://www.gartner.com/document/3981757?ref=solrAll&refval=300973953 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/power-sector-dependency  EU CYBERSECURITY MARKET ANALYSIS  April 2022  57  disturbance monitoring and reporting.100 Protective relays, for example, depend on precision  timing to synchronize monitoring samples and telecommunication equipment.101  5.4.3.1 Range: Short (1 to 3 Years)  Although illegal jammers are already using transmitters to interfere with GPS signals to  scramble or alter location and time of IoT devices, this trend is expected to materialize in 1 to 3  years.102  Several techniques are already emerging to counteract PNT cyberthreats, such as using  encrypted systems and communications, obscuring antennas/install decoys, duplicate  antennas, blocking antennas, or ground-based navigation beacons.  5.4.3.2 Mass: Low  Gartner estimates the overall mass to be overall low. Many assets are still static, although digital  transformation using automation and robotics is increasing, accelerated by the COVID-19  pandemic.103  5.4.4 Digital Risk Protection Services  The digital risk protection services (DRPS) market is composed of technology and service  providers offering solutions developed to protect critical digital assets and data exposed to  external threats. These solutions provide visibility into the clear (surface) web, dark web and  deep web sources to identify potential threats to critical assets and provide contextual  information on threat actors, their tactics and processes utilized to conduct malicious activity.  DRPS provides support in four areas:  mapping, monitoring, mitigating, and managing the  impact on critical digital assets. They ensure that business operations are preserved.  5.4.4.1 Range: Medium (3 to 6 Years)  The estimated distance to the early majority target is anticipated to be at about 5% to 20% of  the journey, at a rather early stage. Otherwise, the pace of investment growth in this technology  is fairly fast and is expected to drive swift adoption of this new technology. DRPS offerings are  particularly valuable for manufacturing organisations that give particular value to their brand.  The ability to protect against phishing campaigns is also key for this vertical, particularly as  cybercriminals seem to increasingly target this sector.  5.4.4.2 Mass: Medium  The impact of DRPS on existing products and markets is medium. This comes as a result of  overlapping with some complementary mainstream cybersecurity offerings, such as threat  intelligence (TI), social media security, endpoint protection platforms (EPPs), secure email  gateways (SEGs) and managed security services (MSSs). Here, providers have been able to  expand offerings by adding DRPS to their service catalogues as an integration to their core  capabilities, as well as stand-alone DRPS. Growing interest in DRPS-type of capabilities will  impact a growing number of sectors (e.g. automotive, consumer goods), seeking out new  market opportunities.  New providers are expanding capabilities to cover the whole spectrum of digital risks, stretching  to the cyber-physical layer and public cloud environments. This is creating new opportunities  and expanding the reach to new buying roles, such as chief marketing officers, chief privacy  officers and chief information officers.  5.4.5 Homomorphic Encryption  100 https://www.epri.com/research/products/000000003002020266, accessed 20 Sep 2021.  101 https://www.gartner.com/document/3945879?ref=solrResearch&refval=300698617, accessed 20 Sep 2021.  102 https://www.gartner.com/document/3981757?ref=solrAll&refval=300591351, accessed 20 Sep 2021.  103 https://www.gartner.com/document/3981757?ref=solrAll&refval=300973953, accessed 20 Sep 2021.  https://www.epri.com/research/products/000000003002020266 https://www.gartner.com/document/3945879?ref=solrResearch&refval=300698617 https://www.gartner.com/document/3981757?ref=solrAll&refval=300591351 https://www.gartner.com/document/3981757?ref=solrAll&refval=300973953  EU CYBERSECURITY MARKET ANALYSIS  April 2022  58  Homomorphic encryption (HE) is a cryptographic method that enables third parties to process  encrypted data and return an encrypted result to the data owner, while providing no knowledge  about the data or the results. HE enables providers to protect proprietary algorithms and data  owners to keep data private. In practice today, fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) is not fast  enough for most manufacturing implementations. As such, partially homomorphic encryption  (PHE) might be a more practical implementation.  As the IoT market matures, stored sensor data collected through countless sensor nodes must  be protected as intellectual property and other sensitive data are vulnerable to attack. HE is  useful to provide encryption to sensor data that can be shared across an ever-growing number  of interconnected meters and actuators installed across the distribution grid.  5.4.5.1 Range: Medium (3 to 6 Years)  Homomorphic encryption is three to six years out, because several factors are inhibiting the  adoption in the near term. Performance issues, cost, lack of standardization and complexity are  expected to slowly progress to the early maturity stage.  5.4.5.2 Mass: Low  Gartner expects low mass from in the HE market, given cost and performance issues for real- time data needed for distribution grids operation. In addition, computational costs for HE might  be out of reach for many utilities.104  104 https://www.gartner.com/document/3981757?ref=solrAll&refval=300973953, accessed 20 Sep 2021.  https://www.gartner.com/document/3981757?ref=solrAll&refval=300973953  EU CYBERSECURITY MARKET ANALYSIS  April 2022  59  6. MACRO-ENVIRONMENTAL  FACTORS  6.1 INTRODUCTION TO THE MACRO-ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS  SECTION  As the IoT cybersecurity market continues to grow in the EU, different factors that determine the  end-user’s IoT cybersecurity adoption process will increase in influence.  A macro-environment refers to the set of conditions that exist in the economy as a whole, rather  than in a particular sector or region. As described in Section 2.1.5 of ECSMAF Version 17 PEST  analysis is one of the most frequently applied measurement tool, used to analyse how four  external factors (Political, Economic, Social and Technology) affect the operations of an  organisation or a specific market segment, in particular:  1. Political: These factors play a critical role, not only in investment decisions (e.g. IoT  cybersecurity investment), but they also can alter the long-term sustainability of  different markets. Some examples include the governance system, regulations,  democracy and institutions.  2. Economic: These factors have a direct impact on the potential attractiveness of a  given market in a particular region or country. Some examples are inflation rate, GDP  growth rate, Foreign Exchange Rate, or disposable income level.  3. Social: These factors can be usually linked to workforce talent availability and the level  of demand. Some examples include the power structure in the society, women  participation in the workforce, emerging end-user behaviour, etc.  4. Technology: These are factors that relate to innovations in technology that may affect  the operations of organizations and a specific market segment. They refer to  technology advancement and maturity, the emergence of disruptive technologies, the  level of innovation, automation, research and development (R&D) activity,  technological change and the amount of technological awareness that a market  possesses.  Other additional factors, not included in the PEST analysis that could be considered are  environmental factors (some examples include greenhouse emissions, or habitat destruction)  and legal factors (e.g. cybersecurity related requirements). Both environmental and legal  factors are important for this analysis on IoT cybersecurity of distribution grids and are covered  in this chapter.  6.2 RESEARCH QUESTIONS  The analysis of macro-environmental factors addresses the question:  • Which macro-environmental factors are influencing IoT cybersecurity in EU distribution  grids?  6.3 METHODOLOGY OF ANALYSIS  This section examines macro-environmental factors that could have a significant impact on how  the IoT cybersecurity market further develops. Additionally, the results of the analyses  presented in this reported — especially those of the market model — could be impacted by  these factors.  EU CYBERSECURITY MARKET ANALYSIS  April 2022  60  The report is not meant to be exhaustive but rather to present exemplary key factors that could  affect how this market develops in the future. Further research could be conducted for selected  factors as the market continues to evolve – e.g. a dedicated deep dive on which regulatory  changes that need to happen to accelerate the adoption of security services projected to an  OPEX model.  6.4 MACRO-ECONOMIC FACTORS OF THE IOT CYBERSECURITY  MARKET  6.4.1 Accelerated electrification of vehicles in EU  As carmakers roll out moderately priced electricity-fuelled models and electric batteries, while  increasing capacity and reducing cost,105 the sales of electric vehicles (EVs) are rapidly gaining  ground in the EU market. Some projections indicate that these may outpace the sales of  combustion engines by 2033.106  The availability of EV charging points remains a fundamental challenge for EV adoption around  the globe. In the EU, 70% of the existing EV charging points are concentrated in three Member  States107 — namely, the Netherlands, France and Germany. In stark contrast, other EU  Members States such as Romania possess only 0.2% of the total EV charging points installed  in the EU.  Figure 28: Distribution of EV charging points in the EU.108  Even though some EU Member States show modest coverage, new policy developments are  expected to significantly accelerate the demand for EV charging points and IoT devices. We  recognize that a further adoption of EVs in the EU could have an impact in the estimated  electricity consumption in the EU-27 between 2021 and 2030. As a result, the IoT cybersecurity  market of “smart” transformers could grow at a higher pace than the projections shown  previously in this report (see Figure 6).  105 https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-02222-1, accessed 20 Sep 2021.  106 https://energynews.us/2021/08/10/commentary-the-united-kingdoms-electric-vehicle-plans-could-be-a-blueprint-for-the- u-s/, accessed 20 Sep 2021  107 https://www.reuters.com/article/eu-cybersecurity-idUSKBN28Q1NS, accessed 20 Sep 2021.  108 https://www.acea.auto/publication/making-the-transition-to-zero-emission-mobility-2020-progress-report/, accessed 20  Sep 2021.  https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-02222-1 https://energynews.us/2021/08/10/commentary-the-united-kingdoms-electric-vehicle-plans-could-be-a-blueprint-for-the-u-s/ https://energynews.us/2021/08/10/commentary-the-united-kingdoms-electric-vehicle-plans-could-be-a-blueprint-for-the-u-s/ https://www.reuters.com/article/eu-cybersecurity-idUSKBN28Q1NS https://www.acea.auto/publication/making-the-transition-to-zero-emission-mobility-2020-progress-report/  EU CYBERSECURITY MARKET ANALYSIS  April 2022  61  6.4.2 Aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic  While COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated the adoption of digital technologies across many  industries, the impact on the electric grids is less direct and needs further analysis. We  recommend planning dedicated research activities on this subject as part of a wider research  agenda.  6.4.3 Available green bonds and government funding for energy  transformation  Green bonds are designated bonds intended to encourage sustainability and to support climate- related or other types of special environmental targets, such as energy efficiency projects, CO2  reduction, etc.  Green bonds come with tax incentives such as tax exemption and tax credits, making them a  more attractive investment compared to a comparable taxable bond. These tax advantages  provide a monetary incentive to private investors.  To progress with its roadmap to become carbon-neutral by 2050,109 the EU has recently  launched their Green Bonds program110 aimed at financing member states’ environmental  beneficial projects, taking its first step to potentially become the biggest issuer of  environmentally friendly debt with a record-sized deal.  We make the hypothesis that depending on the success of this program, the adoption of “smart”  meters and transformers could be accelerated. As a result, the market projections of the IoT  cybersecurity market presented in this report would accelerate.  6.4.4 Limited workforce to execute on grid digitalisation  The combination of a decreasing EU’s working-age population and poor attractiveness of the  construction sector is generating challenges for construction companies to fill job vacancies  across EU. For example, between 2010 and 2018, the Czech Republic and Slovenia recorded  the largest increase in the share of vacancies to the amount of people employed in the sector  (621.9% and 411.7% respectively).111  As a result, we make the hypothesis that depending on how the availability of skilled  construction workers develops, there may not be enough workers to execute grid digitalisation  projects and, even if funding is available, the adoption rates of IoT cybersecurity assumed for  this report may not be achieved.  6.4.5 Accelerated growth in electricity consumption because of global  warming  The accumulation of greenhouse gases in Earth’s atmosphere destabilises the temperature  equilibrium and has far-reaching effects on energy consumption patterns.112  Extreme weather and climate conditions have strong influence on energy consumption, which  directly affects planning and operations of these systems.113 For example, several studies  109 https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_20_335, accessed 20 Sep 2021.  110 https://www.reuters.com/business/sustainable-business/eu-starts-sale-debut-green-bond-ifr-2021-10-12/, accessed 12  Oct 2021.  111 https://ecs-org.eu/documents/publications/5fdb2673903c6.pdf, accessed 20 Sep 2021.  112 https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/frsc.2021.644789/full, accessed 20 Sep 2021.  113 Ronalds, B.

As a result, the IoT cybersecurity market of “smart” transformers could grow at a higher  pace than the projections shown in this report.  6.4.6 Relevant legal framework of IoT cybersecurity in distribution grids  Current legal framework and ongoing or planned legislative and policy initiatives related to the  cybersecurity of IoT in distribution grids play an important role. For instance, privacy  requirements contribute to shape the market. And the importance of privacy is proved by a  number of initiatives taken, with the most important one being the Privacy Impact Assessment  for smart meters driven by European Commission115.  114 Sailor, D. J., and Munoz, J. R. (1997). Sensitivity of electricity and natural gas consumption to climate in the U.S.A.  Methodology and results for eight states.

CONCLUSIONS  This report offers interesting insights into the transformation of the traditional electricity industry  and the increasing role of IoT technologies in this regard. Furthermore, it examines both the  supply and demand side of the smart grid IoT cybersecurity ecosystem in the EU.  As organisations continue to digitalise their operations and improve the flexibility of the grid to  accommodate renewable energy sources, their attack surface has also increased; an evolution  that has been documented and assessed in this report.  7.1 MAIN FINDINGS  The main findings of this report are:  • IoT cybersecurity spending within the distribution grids of the EU-27 is mainly driven by  the adoption of electricity “smart” meters.  • From 2025 to 2030, the IoT cybersecurity market related to smart metres is expected  to be mainly driven by Operational Expenditures (OPEX) rather than Capital  Expenditures (CAPEX). In practice, this means that more capital is expected to be  spent for the maintenance of IoT cybersecurity (such as maintenance of security  software installed in IoT devices, e.g. software patches), than for the purchase of new  cybersecurity hardware or software.  • Analysis indicates that there are no IoT monopolies. Organisations tend to favour  larger IoT vendors that possess the necessary capabilities to cover a wide spectrum of  requirements, limiting the space for market entry of smaller organisations in  consequence.  • There are four main archetypes of suppliers within the IoT cybersecurity market, these  being: multi-domain industrial assets vendors, multi-domain IT vendors, specialist IoT  vendors, and IoT cybersecurity specialist vendors.  • The above-mentioned archetypes exhibit different competitive dynamics, i.e., focussing  on a particular market segment vs. diversification.  • The increase of the demand by the energy industry for cybersecurity tools and services  to improve IoT cybersecurity capabilities of organisations represents one of the trends  on the demand-side.  • Embedded cybersecurity into IoT infrastructure and platforms represents one of the  trends on the supply-side.  • There are multiple technological trends developing in the IoT cybersecurity market.  Among these, cyber-physical system security and operational technology security are  expected to materialize in the short term.  7.2 WAYS FORWARD  This report analyses the IoT cybersecurity market in distribution grids in EU and has served as a  proof-of-concept of an early version of the ENISA Cybersecurity Market Analysis Framework  that was developed in 20217. While confirming the good overall functioning of the framework, it  helped identify aspects of the framework that can be improved.  Some improvements have been already included in the initial version of the framework, which is  expected to further evolve based on the experience that ENISA will gather by applying the  framework to conduct additional analyses. In 2022 and beyond, ENISA, also with the support of  EU CYBERSECURITY MARKET ANALYSIS  April 2022  64  the recently established Ad Hoc Working Group (AHWG) on EU Cybersecurity Market116, will  conduct additional cybersecurity market analyses. Such activities could focus for instance on  other IoT markets, and/or on horizontal aspects of the EU cybersecurity market (e.g.  cybersecurity certification). Based on the experience from conducting the present analysis,  particular attention will be given to the definition of the scope of future analyses, since the  scoping represents an important initial element for the outcome of the analysis and the usability  of achieved results.  116 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/standards/adhoc_wg_calls/ad-hoc-working-group-on-cybersecurity-market,  accessed 13 December 2021.  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/standards/adhoc_wg_calls/ad-hoc-working-group-on-cybersecurity-market  EU CYBERSECURITY MARKET ANALYSIS  April 2022  65  A ANNEX: COVERED IOT  CYBERSECURITY MARKET  SEGMENT  Most relevant cybersecurity segments and categories for IOT device are highlighted in light  blue in the next table.

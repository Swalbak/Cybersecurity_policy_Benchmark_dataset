This report covers the incidents that occurred in 2013 and it gives an aggregated analysis of the  incident reports about severe outages across the EU. This report does not include details about  individual countries or providers. The main statistical data is as follows:   90 major incidents reported: This year, in total 19 countries reported 90 significant incidents  and 9 countries reported no significant incidents.   Mobile networks most affected: Approximately half of the major incidents had an impact on  mobile Internet and mobile telephony.   Mobile network outages affect many users: Incidents affecting mobile Internet or mobile  telephony affected most users (around 1.4 million users and 700 000 users respectively per  incident). This is consistent with the high penetration rates of mobile telephony and Internet.   Impact on emergency calls: A fifth of the major incidents had an impact on the emergency  calls (aka 112 access).   System failures are the most common root cause: Most major incidents were caused by  “System failures” (61 % of the incidents).  o Looking more in detail at this root cause category, the most common detailed causes  were “software bugs” and “hardware failures”.  o The assets most often affected were switches (e.g. mobile switching and routers) and  base stations and controllers.   System failures affect the most user connections: Incidents categorized with the root cause  system failure, affected around 1.5 million user connections on average per incident.  o Looking more in detail, the detailed causes affecting most user connections were  “software misconfiguration”, “software bugs”, and “power surges”.   Natural phenomena and malicious actions cause long lasting incidents: Incidents caused by  natural phenomena (heavy snowfall, storms, etc.) and malicious actions (arson, cable theft,  etc.) lasted on average more than 50 hours.   Natural phenomena and system failures have most impact: Multiplying number of user  connection and duration, one obtains a measure for total impact, or ‘total user hours lost’.  Natural phenomena had on average most impact, followed by system failures.  o Looking more in detail, Power cuts, heavy snowfall, cable cuts and storms,  respectively, impacted most user hours.   Base stations and switches were most affected: Overall, base stations, switches and mobile  switching were the assets most affected by incidents.  ENISA, together with the EC and NRAs in the EU Member States, will discuss specific incidents in more  detail within the Article 13a Expert Group. Where needed, ENISA may publish technical guidance  about mitigating specific types of incidents. This year, for example, following the 2012 incidents, ENISA  has been working on recommendations for providers about how to manage security requirements for  vendors and outsourcing partners they use for their core operations.  The next annual report will be published in summer 2015, for the 2014 incidents.  http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32009L0140:en:NOT http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32009L0140:en:NOT https://resilience.enisa.europa.eu/article-13  Annual Incident Reports 2013  Analysis of Article 13a annual incident reports  September 2014  Page  iv  Table of Contents  Executive summary iii  1 Introduction 1  2 Article 13a of the Framework Directive: ‘Security and Integrity’ 2  3 Article 13a Expert Group and Incident Reporting Procedure 3  3.1 Incident reporting procedure 3  4 Analysis of the incidents 6  4.1 Impact of incidents 7  4.2 Root cause categories 11  4.3 Detailed causes 18  4.4 Assets affected 25  5 Conclusions 28  References 29  1 Introduction  This is the third iteration of this report, which summarises significant security incidents reported to  ENISA and the European Commission (EC), under Article 13a of the Framework Directive  (2009/140/EC), a new article introduced in the 2009 reform of the EU legal framework for electronic  communications. This year ENISA and the EC received 90 incident reports from NRAs, about severe  outages in the EU’s electronic communication networks or services which occurred in 2013. This  report provides an aggregate analysis of these 90 incidents.  Please note that in this document we do not provide details from the individual incident reports. The  analysis is only an aggregation in terms of averages and percentages across the EU, and it does not  contain references to specific countries or specific providers. Individual incidents are discussed in  more detail with the NRAs in the Article 13a Expert Group.  This document is structured as follows: Section 2 and Section 3 briefly summarize Article 13a and the  details of the technical implementation of Article 13a, as agreed in the Article 13a Expert Group by  the different NRAs of the EU Member States. Section 4  analyses the incidents from 2013 which were  reported to ENISA and the EC and provides examples of incidents. The Executive Summary (at the start  of this document) provides a snapshot of this analysis and the conclusions.  http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32009L0140:en:NOT http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32009L0140:en:NOT http://ec.europa.eu/information_society/policy/ecomm/doc/library/regframeforec_dec2009.pdf http://ec.europa.eu/information_society/policy/ecomm/doc/library/regframeforec_dec2009.pdf http://resilience.enisa.europa.eu/article-13  Annual Incident Reports 2013  Analysis of Article 13a annual incident reports  September 2014  2  2 Article 13a of the Framework Directive: ‘Security and Integrity’  The reform of the EU legal framework for electronic communications, which was adopted in 2009 and  was transposed by most EU countries around May 2011, adds Article 13a to the Framework Directive.  Article 13a addresses the security and integrity1 of public electronic communications networks and  services. The legislation concerns National Regulatory Authorities (NRAs) and providers of public  electronic communications networks and services (providers).  Article 13a states:   Providers of public electronic communications networks and services should take measures  to guarantee security and integrity of their networks.   Providers must notify competent national authorities about breaches of security or loss of  integrity that have had significant impact on the operation of networks or services.   National Regulatory Authorities should notify ENISA and national authorities abroad when  necessary, for example in case of incidents with cross-border impact.   Annually, National Regulatory Authorities should submit a summary report to ENISA and the  European Commission about the incidents.  These incident reporting flows (incident notification and annual reporting) are shown in the diagram  below. This document analyses the incidents from 2013 that have been reported to ENISA and the EC  (the black dashed arrow).

In these meetings, a  group of experts from NRAs, called the Article 13a Expert Group, reached agreement on two non- binding technical documents providing guidance to the NRAs in the EU Member States:   Technical Guidelines for Incident Reporting and   Technical Guidelines for Minimum Security Measures.  The Article 13a Expert Group continues to meet several times a year to develop the technical  guidelines and to discuss the implementation of Article 13a (for example, on how to supervise the  electronic communications sector) and to share knowledge and exchange views about past incidents,  and how to address them.  3.1 Incident reporting procedure  In spring 2012, the Commission agreed with the EU Member States (in meetings of the  Communications Committee, COCOM) to do the first round of annual summary reporting on the 2011  incidents. The decision included a recommendation to use the reporting template agreed within the  Article 13a Expert Group and published by ENISA.  Following the COCOM meeting, ENISA implemented  the technical procedure by deploying a basic electronic form based on the Article 13a guidelines for  incident reporting. There was also an agreement that in the coming years, annual reporting would be  carried out by the end of February each year.  In autumn 2012, ENISA developed an online incident reporting tool (called CIRAS), which replaces the  electronic forms exchanged by email. CIRAS allows NRAs to exert greater control over the data  reported and provides the NRAs with better access to data about incidents reported across the EU.  We briefly explain the main features of the incident reporting procedure, as described in the technical  guideline which was developed in collaboration with the NRAs.  3.1.1 Services in scope  NRAs should report incidents affecting the following communication services and networks:   Fixed telephony (e.g. PSTN, VoIP over DSL, Cable, Fibre, etc.),   Mobile telephony (e.g. GSM, UMTS, LTE, etc.),   Fixed Internet access (e.g. DSL, Fibre, Cable, etc.),   Mobile Internet access (e.g. GPRS/EDGE, UMTS, LTE, etc.)  NRAs may also report about incidents affecting other types of services.  3.1.2 Security incidents in scope  NRAs should report security incidents, which had a significant impact on the continuity of supply of  electronic communications networks or services.  3.1.3 National user base  NRAs should provide estimates of the total number of users of each service in their country.   For fixed telephony and Internet, NRAs should use the number of subscribers or access lines  in their country.   For mobile telephony, NRAs should use the number of active telephony SIM cards.  http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32009L0140:en:NOT https://resilience.enisa.europa.eu/article-13 https://resilience.enisa.europa.eu/article-13/ https://resilience.enisa.europa.eu/article-13/ https://resilience.enisa.europa.eu/article-13 https://resilience.enisa.europa.eu/article-13/guideline-for-incident-reporting https://resilience.enisa.europa.eu/article-13/guideline-for-incident-reporting  Annual Incident Reports 2013  Analysis of Article 13a annual incident reports  September 2014  4   For mobile Internet, NRAs should sum up2:  1. The number of standard mobile subscriptions, which offer both telephony and  Internet access, and which have been used for Internet access recently (e.g. in the  past 3 months).  2. The number of subscriptions dedicated for mobile Internet access, which are  purchased separately, either standalone or on top of an existing voice subscription.  3.1.4 Thresholds  The threshold for annual summary reporting is based on the duration and the number of users of a  service affected as a percentage of the national user base of the service.  NRAs should send an incident report, as part of the annual summary reporting, if the incident:   lasts more than an hour, and the percentage of users affected is higher than 15 %,   lasts more than 2 hours, and the percentage of users affected is higher than 10 %,   lasts more than 4 hours, and the percentage of users affected is higher than 5 %,   lasts more than 6 hours, and the percentage of users affected is higher than 2 %, or if it   lasts more than 8 hours, and the percentage of users affected is higher than 1 %.  1 h  <...<2 h  2 h  <...<4 h  4 h  <...<6 h  6 h  <...<8 h  >8 h  1%<...< 2% of user base  2%<...< 5% of user base  5%<...< 10% of user base  10%<...< 15% of user base  > 15% of user base  Figure 2 Threshold for annual summary reporting based on a combination of duration and the percentage of the national user base.  The threshold should be understood ‘per service’. In other words, if one incident involves impact on  multiple services, then for one of the services the threshold should be passed in order to trigger the  reporting mechanism. NRAs may also report incidents with impact graded below the threshold.  For 2013, we introduced a new optional threshold for annual summary reporting, based on absolute  impact, in order to allow NRAs in large Member States to include larger incidents but that would not  exceed the relative thresholds. NRAs may optionally include incidents when the product of duration  and number of user connections affected exceeds 180 million user minutes, or 3 million user hours.  For next year’s reporting, about the 2014 incidents, this absolute threshold has been lowered and  becomes mandatory.  2 Reference is made to the definition agreed in the COCOM meetings.  Annual Incident Reports 2013  Analysis of Article 13a annual incident reports  September 2014  5  3.1.5 Root cause categories  In the incident reports four categories of root causes have been distinguished plus one category that  is used in conjunction with one of the other four categories.   Natural phenomena – This category includes incidents caused by severe weather,  earthquakes, floods, pandemic diseases, wildfires, wildlife, and so on.   Human errors - This category includes incidents caused by errors committed by employees of  the provider or outside the provider, during the operation of equipment or facilities, the use  of tools, the execution of procedures, etc. E.g. an excavator cutting off a cable.   Malicious attacks - This category includes incidents caused by a deliberate act by someone or  some organisation, e.g. a cyber-attack or a cable theft.   System failures – This category includes incidents caused by failures of a system, for example  hardware failures, software failures or flaws in manuals, procedures or policies.   Third party failures – This category includes incidents caused by a failure or incident at a third  party. This category is used in conjunctions with one of the other root cause categories.  Annual Incident Reports 2013  Analysis of Article 13a annual incident reports  September 2014  6  4 Analysis of the incidents  In total, all 28 EU Member States participated in this process. Of these, 18 countries and one EFTA  Member State reported in total 90 significant incidents, 9 countries reported there were no significant  incidents and one country had not implemented incident reporting yet.  The two pie charts to the right show the situation the previous two years. In the rest of this report we  show, besides the data about the 2013 incidents, figures and diagrams from the previous two years,  to allow the reader to make a comparison.  In this section the  In this section, the 90 reported incidents are aggregated and analysed. First, the impact per service is  analysed (in Section 4.1 ), then the impact per root cause category is analysed (Section 4.2), and in  Section 4.3  detailed causes are examined. In Section 4.3 impact as a product of user connections  affected and duration of the incidents is analysed and in Section 4.5 the components or assets affected  by the incidents are considered. Throughout the text we provide anonymized descriptions (in blue  italic) of actual large-scale incidents which occurred in 2013.  Note about statistical conclusions: Readers should be cautious when drawing conclusions from the  statistics in this report. In particular, they should take into account that:  1. The scope of reporting major security incidents is restricted to incidents with an impact on the  continuity of public electronic communication services and networks. There are many other  types of incidents with an impact on security of services and networks which are not in scope  of annual reporting. For example, if attackers would wiretap undersea cables without causing  any outages, then such a security incident would not be included in the annual reporting.  2. We are still in the early phases of implementation of Article 13a. There are still changes and  improvements in the way national and EU reporting is being implemented. Statistical  conclusions about multi-annual trends should therefore be drawn with care.  3. The scope of reporting includes only major, or significant, incidents scoring above the agreed  thresholds. Smaller incidents are not reported at an EU level and this means that the view is  skewed towards the larger incidents.  2011  19  9  1 Number of countries reporting significant incidents  Number of countries reporting no significant incidents  Number of countries without Article 13a implementation  Figure 3: Countries involved in the annual summary reporting over 2013.  2012  Annual Incident Reports 2013  Analysis of Article 13a annual incident reports  September 2014  7  4.1 Impact of incidents  We focus first on the impact of incidents on the electronic communications networks and services.  4.1.1 Impact per service  Approximately half of the reported incidents affected mobile internet or mobile telephony, as was the  case in 2012 and in 2013.  Most incidents have an impact on two or more services (which is why the percentages in the chart  add up to 149 %). National thresholds for reporting are per service and a percentage of the total  national user base for that service. So this would suggest that mobile services are more at risk of large  outages than fixed services.  Faulty network update caused mobile telephony and mobile Internet to fail (duration: hours,  connections: millions, cause: system failure): A planned network upgrade was done at night for mobile  phone call services. After the upgrade, customers’ call and data services failed. Because the change  was made to call and not data services, the cause of the failure was difficult to locate. The problem  occurred to users under one Radio Network Controller (RNC), but not all of them, which rendered  locating the cause even harder.  2011 2012  Figure 4: Incidents per service (percentage)  29  19  48 53  Fixed telephony Fixed Internet Mobile Telephony Mobile Internet  Annual Incident Reports 2013  Analysis of Article 13a annual incident reports  September 2014  8  4.1.2 Number of user connections affected  Mobile Internet outages affected on average 1.4 million user connections per incident. Incidents with  an impact on mobile telephony affected on average 700 000 user connections.  The difference between fixed and mobile may partly be due to the fact that some of the impacted  components, we call them assets, in the mobile networks, were more centrally located parts of the  networks as compared to the failed assets for fixed services, thus affecting more user connections per  incident.  EU averages shown here are not representative of the size of incidents nationally. The averages in  these diagrams include both small and large countries. Nationally, the average size of incidents can be  very different, depending on the size of the population and/or the national network topology.  200 100  700  1400  Fixed telephony Fixed Internet Mobile Telephony Mobile Internet  2011 2012  Figure 5: Average number of user connections affected per incident per service (1000s).  Annual Incident Reports 2013  Analysis of Article 13a annual incident reports  September 2014  9  4.1.3 Percentage of the national user base affected  Mobile Internet outages impacted about 9 % of the national user base for mobile Internet user  connections on average, a significant portion of the national user base. Each year there has been a  drop in failed user connections for all services, but it should be noted that a larger share of smaller  incidents have been reported year by year. All three years, mobile Internet has been reported to suffer  the most impact in terms of affected user connections compared to the other services.  Faulty upgrade in router caused mobile Internet to fail (duration: hours, connections: thousands,  cause: system failure): Disruption of connection of mobile data sessions was caused by a failed  upgrade of hardware and software in a router.  4.1.4 Impact on emergency services  One fifth of the incidents involved an impact on emergency calls - i.e. the possibility for users to  contact emergency call-centres using the emergency number 112. Compared to previous years this  figure is at its lowest.  4 5 5  9  Fixed telephony Fixed Internet Mobile Telephony Mobile Internet  Figure 7: Impact on emergency calls.  2011 2012  2011  Figure 6: Percentage of national user base affected on average per incident per service.  2012  21  79  Affected Not affected  Annual Incident Reports 2013  Analysis of Article 13a annual incident reports  September 2014  10  4.1.5 Impact on interconnections  In 4 % of the incidents there was an impact on interconnections between other providers.  This is the  lowest figure since annual summary reporting started.  4  96  Affected Not affected  Figure 8: Impact on interconnections  2011  2012  Annual Incident Reports 2013  Analysis of Article 13a annual incident reports  September 2014  11  4.2 Root cause categories  Now we look at the main root cause categories of reported incidents. Root cause categories are very  broad categories for incidents.  4.2.1 Incidents per root cause category  In 2013 about 61 % of the incidents were ‘System failures’, 19 % caused by ‘human errors’. Only 6 %  was categorized as ‘malicious actions’.  Over the last 3 years the root cause category ‘System failures’ has been the most common root cause  category.  Hardware failure caused interruptions to mobile Internet services (duration: hours, connections:  thousands, cause: system failure): A hardware failure on the transmission node (router) caused the  interruption of all data traffic between the Gateway GPRS Support Node (GGSN) and gateway router.  All mobile users who during the time of failure tried to access the Internet were affected.  2011  Figure 9: Incidents per root cause category (percentage).  2012  14  19  6  61  Natural phenomena  Human errors  Malicious actions  System failures  12  12  6 47  6 5  8  76  Annual Incident Reports 2013  Analysis of Article 13a annual incident reports  September 2014  12  4.2.2 Third party failures  About 11 % of the incidents reported were categorized as ‘third party failures’ (see Figure 10).  We analyse these third party failures in more detail and show the corresponding root cause category  in these cases (see Figure 11). Third party failures have similar root causes as incidents which are not  categorized as third party failures.  Cable cut caused mobile outage (duration: hours, connections: thousands, cause: third party and  human error): Mobile telephony and mobile Internet services were disrupted for thousands of users  for several hours when another operator was installing a cable and cut a cable of the former operator.  At the same time as the fault was located, the redundant connection also failed. The interface unit of  the redundant connection was reset, which returned the services for customers. The cable cut was fixed  and the traffic was rerouted back to the original route.  18  27  9  45  Natural phenomena  Human errors  Malicious actions  System failures  Figure 10: Third party failures and non-third party failures of all incidents (percentages).  89  11  Non third party failures Third party failures  Figure 11: Third party root causes (percentage).  Annual Incident Reports 2013  Analysis of Article 13a annual incident reports  September 2014  13  4.2.3 Root cause categories per service  Here we look at the root causes for each of the four services separately: fixed telephony, fixed Internet  access, mobile telephony and mobile Internet access.  In 2013, most of the incidents with an impact on fixed telephony and fixed Internet were caused by  natural phenomena. Most of the incidents with an impact on mobile telephony and mobile Internet  were categorized as System failures.  2011  Figure 12: Root cause categories for fixed telephony (percentage).  2011  2012  Figure 13: Root cause categories for fixed Internet (percentage).  12  6  18  18  7 14  76  5 5  25  60  47  12  18  24  Fixed Internet  Natural phenomena  Human errors  Malicious actions  System failures  18  99  18  2012  38  31  4  27  Fixed telephony  Natural phenomena  Human errors  Malicious actions  System failures  Annual Incident Reports 2013  Analysis of Article 13a annual incident reports  September 2014  14  2011  Figure 15: Root cause categories for mobile Internet (percentage).  2012  2011  Figure 14: Root cause categories for mobile telephony (percentage).  2012  20  7 57  28  12  2  58  Mobile Telephony  Natural phenomena  Human errors  Malicious actions  System failures  20  7 3  47  10 5  13 64  21  17  4  58  Mobile Internet  Natural phenomena  Human errors  Malicious actions  System failures  11 3  87  Annual Incident Reports 2013  Analysis of Article 13a annual incident reports  September 2014  15  4.2.4 Average duration of incidents per root cause category  Incidents caused by natural phenomena had a long recovery time on average per incident (54 hours).  This year the average incident duration for malicious actions was also high (53 hours). It should be  mentioned, however, that the figure was skewed by one particular incident which took very long to  resolve (164 hours). Overall natural phenomena caused the longest outages for all three years.  DDoS attack on DNS servers causing Internet unavailability (duration: days, connections: thousands,  cause: malicious action): The DNS of some Internet service providers were DDoS attacked causing  Internet access to be practically unavailable for 150 000 users for 2 hours.  Theft attempt caused cable cut to carrier network (duration: days, connections: thousands, cause:  malicious action): An attempted theft of copper resulted in the cutting of 12 cables, each containing  over 100 fibres. The incident occurred on the same street as the Point of Presence (PoP) site for the  national carrier network resulting in a failure of all resilient service options.  Storm shut down Power supply causing mobile networks to fail (duration: days, connection:  thousands, cause: natural phenomena and third party failure): A storm hit the country damaging  trees, affecting the power grid and all mobile networks within the storm area. The impact was limited  to urban areas but its effect was more long lasting in rural areas. The base stations ran out of battery  and were left without power. Also some fixed lines were affected.  4.2.5 Average number of user connections affected per root cause category  We now show the number of user connections affected per incident for each of the different root  cause categories. We are showing user connections affected and not users affected, because a single  consumer often has access to multiple services, for example fixed telephony and mobile telephony,  54  9  53  7  Natural phenomena  Human errors  Malicious actions  System failures  2011 2012  Figure 16: Average duration of incidents per root cause category (hours).  Annual Incident Reports 2013  Analysis of Article 13a annual incident reports  September 2014  16  which may all fail in the same incident. So the number of user connections impacted is often a multiple  of the number of users impacted.  System failures affected most user connections; on average over 1.5 million user connections per  incident.  Comparing with the analysis of the duration, this means that incidents caused by malicious actions  lasted very long (over 50 hours) but the number of user connections impacted in these incidents was  relatively limited (on around 100 000 user connections).  2011 2012  Figure 17: Average number of user connections affected per incident per root cause (1000s)  430  690  110  1500  Natural phenomena  Human errors  Malicious actions  System failures  Annual Incident Reports 2013  Analysis of Article 13a annual incident reports  September 2014  17  4.2.6 User hours lost per root cause category  Last year we started to look at the impact in terms of user hours lost. Taking into account both the  number of user connections affected and the duration of the incident yields a measure for the total  impact of an incident. We call it ‘user hours lost’. Natural phenomena had most impact in terms of  user hours lost. This suggests that this is the category of outages which affects most users most of the  time. At the same time, it is important to remember that these numbers are only representative of  large scale incidents, because small incidents remain below the thresholds.  Severe storm affecting power supply and mobile networks causing large scale mobile outage  (duration: days, connections: thousands, cause: natural phenomena and third party failure): A deep  low-pressure with storms and hurricane winds caused power outages, damaged transmission lines to  mobile sites and damaged access networks. Hundreds of GSM and LTE sites and thousands of UMTS  sites were affected, with some lasting longer than 72 hours.  Figure 18: Average user hours lost per incident per root cause category.  23000  6000  5600  1100  Natural phenomena  Human errors  Malicious actions  System failures  2012  Annual Incident Reports 2013  Analysis of Article 13a annual incident reports  September 2014  18  4.3 Detailed causes  Root cause categories are rather broad. In this section we look at the detailed causes of incidents. The  detailed causes give a better overview of what are technically the causes of incidents.  To explain the difference between root cause categories and detailed causes: Take for example an  incident in which a storm leads to a power cut which leads to an outage. For this incident both storm  and power cut are detailed causes.  4.3.1 Detailed causes of all incidents  In 2013, the most common causes of incidents were ‘software bug’ and ‘hardware failure’. This was  also the case for the previous two years. Also ‘power cut’ was among the top four causes during all  three years. For the 2013 reporting, we added ‘software misconfiguration’ as a cause, which turned  out to be a significant cause of incidents3.  Outage for mobile Internet users caused by hard disc failure (duration: hours, connections:  thousands, cause: hardware failure):  A hard disc failure occurred on one of the Serving GPRS Support  Nodes (SGSN) when swapping over to a backup image on a redundant disc. All connectivity was lost to  the SGSN leaving hundreds of thousands subscribers without mobile Internet access for eight hours.  3 The list of causes has been fine-tuned if compared with past editions of this Report. For example, the cause  hardware/software failure (2011) was split in 2012, and the causes software misconfiguration, hardware  misconfiguration, fire and wildfire were added for the 2013 reporting.  38  23  13 11 9 6 6 4 3 1 1 1 1 1 1 1  Figure 19: Detailed causes of reported incidents (percentage)  2012  29 29  19 14  8 7 6 6 4 4 4 3 3 2 2 1 1 1 1  41 20 14 10 6 6 4 4 4 2 2 2 2 2  2011  Annual Incident Reports 2013  Analysis of Article 13a annual incident reports  September 2014  19  4.3.2 Detailed causes per service  Now we split up the data about detailed causes for each of the four services (fixed telephony, fixed  Internet, mobile telephony and mobile Internet) - see figures 20, 21, 22 and 23 below. Many incidents  with an impact on fixed telephony and fixed Internet were caused by power cuts, and many incidents  with an impact on mobile Internet and mobile telephony were caused by hardware failures and  software bugs but also power cuts was a significant cause of failure.  31 17  10 10 7 3 3 3 3 3  Figure 20: Detailed causes for fixed telephony (percentage).  36 27  18 18 9 9 9  33  22 19  11 11 7 7 7 7  4 4  2011  2012 2011  Annual Incident Reports 2013  Analysis of Article 13a annual incident reports  September 2014  20  2012  Figure 22: Detailed causes for mobile telephony (percentage).  26 22  13 13 9 9 9 9  4 4 4 4  Figure 21: Detailed causes for fixed Internet (percentage).  35 24  18 12 12  6 6 6 6  2011  35 20 15  10 5 5 5 5 5 5 5  2012  35 28  16 12 9 7 7 5 5 5 5 2 2 2  52  26 10 10 6 6 6 3 3 3 3  2011  32 21  16 13 5 3 3 3 3 3 3 3  Annual Incident Reports 2013  Analysis of Article 13a annual incident reports  September 2014  21  2012  40  21 21 13  8 6 6 4 4 4 2 2 2 2  36  15 13 13 10 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3  2011  Figure 23: Detailed causes for mobile Internet (percentage).  43  27  10 10 7 7 3 3 3 3 3 3  2011  Annual Incident Reports 2013  Analysis of Article 13a annual incident reports  September 2014  22  4.3.3 Average duration of incidents per detailed cause  Last year we started to look at average duration of incidents, user connections affected and impact in  terms of duration times the user connections affected for the detailed causes.  Incidents caused by Fire and Heavy Snowfall had the longest duration (86 and 62 hours respectively)  followed by power cuts (53 hours) and Storms (47 hours).  Snowstorms caused mobile service outages (durations: days, connections: thousands, cause: heavy  snowfall): The weather conditions were unusually bad for five days causing outages to mobile  communications in 50 villages and smaller towns. 150 2G base stations and 50 3G stations all in all  went down.  86  62 53  47 44  23 13 10 10 10 9 5 5 5 4 3 3 3 2  2012  Figure 24: Average duration of incidents per detailed cause (hours).  84 72 72  36 22 14 10 9 8 8 8 8 6 5 3 3  Annual Incident Reports 2013  Analysis of Article 13a annual incident reports  September 2014  23  4.3.4 Average number of user connections affected per detailed cause  Software bugs were the cause affecting most user connections (more than 2.4 million connections on  average per incident) followed by power surges and bad maintenance with 2 million and 1.2 million  affected connections respectively.  Software bug caused outage for millions of mobile Internet users nationally (duration: hours,  connections: millions, cause: software bug): Mobile data transmission services failed for three million  users for several hours caused by the database for tariff management running out of memory space.  Due to a software bug, no memory storage alerts were submitted and the services provided by the  database could not be automatically restarted.

Also in 2012 Power cuts had high impact. Cyber-attacks did not have any  significant impact on electronic communications during 2013.  Power failure caused service failure for virtual mobile operator (duration: hours, connections:  thousands, cause: power failure):  Loss of primary and secondary power to the data centre of a Mobile Virtual Network Operator caused  a loss of voice and data connections. After reinstating the primary circuit breaker, power was restored  and subsequent actions returned the equipment to full service.  40466  18635 18360 13960 13314  11544 11228 10223 6324 6000 4752 4400 3092 3068 2197 1824 1680 526 450  Figure 26: Average user hours lost per incident per detailed cause.  2012  77161 69941  60612  21600 12893  4689 4608 3432 3000 2700 2352 2061 2042 1526 1471 223  Annual Incident Reports 2013  Analysis of Article 13a annual incident reports  September 2014  25  4.4 Assets affected  For the second year we received reports from NRAs about which components or assets of the  electronic communications networks were affected by the incidents. This provides some more  information about the nature of the outages and what assets of the infrastructure that were primarily  involved in them.  4.4.1 Assets affected overall  Base stations and controllers were the assets most affected, followed by Switches. Also in 2012 Base  stations and Switches were in the top three in terms of assets affected.  Power cuts due to bad weather shut down mobile base stations (duration: days, connections:  thousands, causes: power cut): A severe storm caused long lasting power cuts leading to mobile  communication base stations shutting down. Also communication cables had physical breaks. Over  200 2G and 100 3G base stations became non-operational for about four days.  20 16  14 9 9  6 6 3 3  1 1 1 1  Figure 27: Assets affected by the incidents (percentage).  2012  20 19  13 11  9 7  4 4 4 4 2 2 2 1  Annual Incident Reports 2013  Analysis of Article 13a annual incident reports  September 2014  26  4.4.2 Affected assets in system failures  System failure was the most common root cause category for all incidents in 2013. In these system  failures the most often affected assets were the Mobile Switching Centres (MSC), the switches and  routers, and the base stations.  Switching server failure caused mobile outage (duration: hours, connections: thousands, cause:  system failure): Due to a failure in a switching server, mobile communications (2G and 3G) became  unavailable in a large part of the country.

Both PSTN and VoIP  were mostly affected by storms. PSTN was also affected by hardware failure, and on third place power  cuts and flood, whereas VoIP was evenly affected by hardware failure, software bugs, bad change and  flooding. Figure 29 shows the overall picture of the causes, for incidents affecting PSTN and VoIP  services.  12  4  31  4 8 8  19  4 4 4 44 4  15  4 4 0  19  0 4 4  0  PSTN VoIP  14  3 3 0 0  10  3  14 10  0  7 10 10  3  PSTN VoIP  2012  Figure 29: Detailed causes for incidents affecting PSTN and VoIP (percentage).  Annual Incident Reports 2013  Analysis of Article 13a annual incident reports  September 2014  28  5 Conclusions  In this Report ENISA summarized how the incident reporting scheme, mandated by Article 13a of the  Framework Directive (2009/140/EC), was implemented across the EU and analysed incident reports  from 2013. ENISA and the Commission received as part of the third round of reporting from the  National Regulatory Authorities 90 reports about major incidents that occurred in 2013.  From the 90 significant incidents reported to ENISA and the European Commission, the following  conclusions can be drawn.   Mobile networks most affected: Most incidents affected mobile Internet followed by mobile  telephony (53 % and 48 % respectively).   Mobile network outages affect many users: Incidents affecting mobile Internet or mobile  telephony affected most users (around 1.4 million users and 700 000 users respectively per  incident). This is consistent with the high penetration rate of mobile telephony and mobile  Internet.   Emergency Services are affected by incidents: In 21 % of the incidents there was impact on  emergency calls using the emergency number 112.   System failures are the most common root cause: Most incidents were caused by root causes  in the category system failures (61 % of the incidents). This was the most common root cause  category for mobile networks. In the category system failures, software bugs and hardware  failures were the most common causes. The assets most often affected by system failures  were switches (e.g. mobile switching and routers) and base stations and controllers.   System failures affect many users: Incidents categorized with the root cause system failures,  affected around 1.5 million user connections on average per incident. Incidents involving the  detailed cause software bug affected around 2.5 million connections on average per incident.   Natural phenomena and malicious actions cause long lasting incidents: Incidents caused by  natural phenomena (mainly storms and heavy snowfalls) and malicious actions lasted on  average 54 and 53 hours respectively.   Power cuts and heavy snowfall have most impact: Incidents caused by power cuts followed  by heavy snowfall respectively had most impact in terms of number of user connections  affected multiplied by the duration of the incident.   Base stations and Switches most affected by incidents: Overall, base stations, switches and  mobile switching were the network components most affected by incidents.  Based on the annual summary reporting of 2011 and 2012 incidents, ENISA analysed in 2013 the  dependencies in the electronic communications sector on power supply and issued recommendations  regarding the sector’s ability to withstand and act efficiently after power cuts. ENISA also studied in  2013 national roaming for increased resilience in mobile networks. This year, based on the annual  summary reporting of 2012 and 2013 incidents, ENISA is issuing recommendations for providers about  how to manage security requirements for vendors and outsourcing partners they use for their core  operations. Based on the 2012 and 2013 summary reporting ENISA is also studying national initiatives  to reduce the number of under-ground cable breaks caused by mistakes.  ENISA, in the context of the Article 13a Expert Group, will discuss specific incidents in more detail with  the NRAs, and if needed, discuss and agree on mitigating measures.  ENISA would like to take this opportunity to thank the NRAs, Ministries and the European Commission  for a fruitful collaboration and we look forward to leveraging this kind of reporting to further improve  the security and resilience of the electronic communications sector in the EU and more generally for  supervision of security also in other critical sectors. The next annual report will be published in  summer 2015, for the 2014 incidents.  http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32009L0140:en:NOT http://www.enisa.europa.eu/media/press-releases/new-report-on-power-supply-dependencies http://www.enisa.europa.eu/media/press-releases/using-national-roaming-to-mitigate-mobile-network-outages201d-new-report-by-eu-cyber-security-agency-enisa https://resilience.enisa.europa.eu/article-13  Annual Incident Reports 2013  Analysis of Article 13a annual incident reports  September 2014  29  References  Related ENISA papers   The Article 13a EG technical guidelines on incident reporting and on security measures:  https://resilience.enisa.europa.eu/article-13   ENISA’s reports about the 2011 and 2012 incidents, reported under Article 13a:  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/Incidents-reporting/annual- reports   ENISA’s study 2013 on Power Supply Dependencies in the Electronic Communications  Sector: http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/Incidents- reporting/power-supply-dependencies   ENISA’s study 2013 on National Roaming for Resilience:  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/Incidents-reporting/national- roaming-for-resilience   ENISA’s whitepaper on cyber incident reporting in the EU shows Article 13a and how it  compares to some other security articles mandating incident reporting and security  measures: http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/Incidents- reporting/cyber-incident-reporting-in-the-eu   For the interested reader, ENISA’s 2009 paper on incident reporting shows an overview of  the situation in the EU 5 years ago: http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and- CIIP/Incidents-reporting/good-practice-guide-on-incident-reporting/good-practice-guide-on- incident-reporting-1  EU legislation   Article 13a of the Framework directive of the EU legislative framework on electronic  communications:  http://ec.europa.eu/information_society/policy/ecomm/doc/140framework.pdf   The electronic communications regulatory framework (incorporating the telecom reform):  http://ec.europa.eu/information_society/policy/ecomm/doc/library/regframeforec_dec200 9.pdf   An overview of the main elements of the 2009 reform:  http://ec.europa.eu/information_society/policy/ecomm/tomorrow/reform/index_en.htm   In 2013 the European Commission issued a European Cyber Security Strategy and proposed  a directive on Cyber Security.

This report covers the incidents that occurred in 2013 and it gives an aggregated analysis of the  incident reports about severe outages across the EU. This report does not include details about  individual countries or providers. The main statistical data is as follows:   90 major incidents reported: This year, in total 19 countries reported 90 significant incidents  and 9 countries reported no significant incidents.   Mobile networks most affected: Approximately half of the major incidents had an impact on  mobile Internet and mobile telephony.   Mobile network outages affect many users: Incidents affecting mobile Internet or mobile  telephony affected most users (around 1.4 million users and 700 000 users respectively per  incident). This is consistent with the high penetration rates of mobile telephony and Internet.   Impact on emergency calls: A fifth of the major incidents had an impact on the emergency  calls (aka 112 access).   System failures are the most common root cause: Most major incidents were caused by  “System failures” (61 % of the incidents).  o Looking more in detail at this root cause category, the most common detailed causes  were “software bugs” and “hardware failures”.  o The assets most often affected were switches (e.g. mobile switching and routers) and  base stations and controllers.   System failures affect the most user connections: Incidents categorized with the root cause  system failure, affected around 1.5 million user connections on average per incident.  o Looking more in detail, the detailed causes affecting most user connections were  “software misconfiguration”, “software bugs”, and “power surges”.   Natural phenomena and malicious actions cause long lasting incidents: Incidents caused by  natural phenomena (heavy snowfall, storms, etc.) and malicious actions (arson, cable theft,  etc.) lasted on average more than 50 hours.   Natural phenomena and system failures have most impact: Multiplying number of user  connection and duration, one obtains a measure for total impact, or ‘total user hours lost’.  Natural phenomena had on average most impact, followed by system failures.  o Looking more in detail, Power cuts, heavy snowfall, cable cuts and storms,  respectively, impacted most user hours.   Base stations and switches were most affected: Overall, base stations, switches and mobile  switching were the assets most affected by incidents.  ENISA, together with the EC and NRAs in the EU Member States, will discuss specific incidents in more  detail within the Article 13a Expert Group. Where needed, ENISA may publish technical guidance  about mitigating specific types of incidents. This year, for example, following the 2012 incidents, ENISA  has been working on recommendations for providers about how to manage security requirements for  vendors and outsourcing partners they use for their core operations.  The next annual report will be published in summer 2015, for the 2014 incidents.  http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32009L0140:en:NOT http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32009L0140:en:NOT https://resilience.enisa.europa.eu/article-13  Annual Incident Reports 2013  Analysis of Article 13a annual incident reports  September 2014  Page  iv  Table of Contents  Executive summary iii  1 Introduction 1  2 Article 13a of the Framework Directive: ‘Security and Integrity’ 2  3 Article 13a Expert Group and Incident Reporting Procedure 3  3.1 Incident reporting procedure 3  4 Analysis of the incidents 6  4.1 Impact of incidents 7  4.2 Root cause categories 11  4.3 Detailed causes 18  4.4 Assets affected 25  5 Conclusions 28  References 29  1 Introduction  This is the third iteration of this report, which summarises significant security incidents reported to  ENISA and the European Commission (EC), under Article 13a of the Framework Directive  (2009/140/EC), a new article introduced in the 2009 reform of the EU legal framework for electronic  communications. This year ENISA and the EC received 90 incident reports from NRAs, about severe  outages in the EU’s electronic communication networks or services which occurred in 2013. This  report provides an aggregate analysis of these 90 incidents.  Please note that in this document we do not provide details from the individual incident reports. The  analysis is only an aggregation in terms of averages and percentages across the EU, and it does not  contain references to specific countries or specific providers. Individual incidents are discussed in  more detail with the NRAs in the Article 13a Expert Group.  This document is structured as follows: Section 2 and Section 3 briefly summarize Article 13a and the  details of the technical implementation of Article 13a, as agreed in the Article 13a Expert Group by  the different NRAs of the EU Member States. Section 4  analyses the incidents from 2013 which were  reported to ENISA and the EC and provides examples of incidents. The Executive Summary (at the start  of this document) provides a snapshot of this analysis and the conclusions.  http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32009L0140:en:NOT http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32009L0140:en:NOT http://ec.europa.eu/information_society/policy/ecomm/doc/library/regframeforec_dec2009.pdf http://ec.europa.eu/information_society/policy/ecomm/doc/library/regframeforec_dec2009.pdf http://resilience.enisa.europa.eu/article-13  Annual Incident Reports 2013  Analysis of Article 13a annual incident reports  September 2014  2  2 Article 13a of the Framework Directive: ‘Security and Integrity’  The reform of the EU legal framework for electronic communications, which was adopted in 2009 and  was transposed by most EU countries around May 2011, adds Article 13a to the Framework Directive.  Article 13a addresses the security and integrity1 of public electronic communications networks and  services. The legislation concerns National Regulatory Authorities (NRAs) and providers of public  electronic communications networks and services (providers).  Article 13a states:   Providers of public electronic communications networks and services should take measures  to guarantee security and integrity of their networks.   Providers must notify competent national authorities about breaches of security or loss of  integrity that have had significant impact on the operation of networks or services.   National Regulatory Authorities should notify ENISA and national authorities abroad when  necessary, for example in case of incidents with cross-border impact.   Annually, National Regulatory Authorities should submit a summary report to ENISA and the  European Commission about the incidents.  These incident reporting flows (incident notification and annual reporting) are shown in the diagram  below. This document analyses the incidents from 2013 that have been reported to ENISA and the EC  (the black dashed arrow).

In these meetings, a  group of experts from NRAs, called the Article 13a Expert Group, reached agreement on two non- binding technical documents providing guidance to the NRAs in the EU Member States:   Technical Guidelines for Incident Reporting and   Technical Guidelines for Minimum Security Measures.  The Article 13a Expert Group continues to meet several times a year to develop the technical  guidelines and to discuss the implementation of Article 13a (for example, on how to supervise the  electronic communications sector) and to share knowledge and exchange views about past incidents,  and how to address them.  3.1 Incident reporting procedure  In spring 2012, the Commission agreed with the EU Member States (in meetings of the  Communications Committee, COCOM) to do the first round of annual summary reporting on the 2011  incidents. The decision included a recommendation to use the reporting template agreed within the  Article 13a Expert Group and published by ENISA.  Following the COCOM meeting, ENISA implemented  the technical procedure by deploying a basic electronic form based on the Article 13a guidelines for  incident reporting. There was also an agreement that in the coming years, annual reporting would be  carried out by the end of February each year.  In autumn 2012, ENISA developed an online incident reporting tool (called CIRAS), which replaces the  electronic forms exchanged by email. CIRAS allows NRAs to exert greater control over the data  reported and provides the NRAs with better access to data about incidents reported across the EU.  We briefly explain the main features of the incident reporting procedure, as described in the technical  guideline which was developed in collaboration with the NRAs.  3.1.1 Services in scope  NRAs should report incidents affecting the following communication services and networks:   Fixed telephony (e.g. PSTN, VoIP over DSL, Cable, Fibre, etc.),   Mobile telephony (e.g. GSM, UMTS, LTE, etc.),   Fixed Internet access (e.g. DSL, Fibre, Cable, etc.),   Mobile Internet access (e.g. GPRS/EDGE, UMTS, LTE, etc.)  NRAs may also report about incidents affecting other types of services.  3.1.2 Security incidents in scope  NRAs should report security incidents, which had a significant impact on the continuity of supply of  electronic communications networks or services.  3.1.3 National user base  NRAs should provide estimates of the total number of users of each service in their country.   For fixed telephony and Internet, NRAs should use the number of subscribers or access lines  in their country.   For mobile telephony, NRAs should use the number of active telephony SIM cards.  http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32009L0140:en:NOT https://resilience.enisa.europa.eu/article-13 https://resilience.enisa.europa.eu/article-13/ https://resilience.enisa.europa.eu/article-13/ https://resilience.enisa.europa.eu/article-13 https://resilience.enisa.europa.eu/article-13/guideline-for-incident-reporting https://resilience.enisa.europa.eu/article-13/guideline-for-incident-reporting  Annual Incident Reports 2013  Analysis of Article 13a annual incident reports  September 2014  4   For mobile Internet, NRAs should sum up2:  1. The number of standard mobile subscriptions, which offer both telephony and  Internet access, and which have been used for Internet access recently (e.g. in the  past 3 months).  2. The number of subscriptions dedicated for mobile Internet access, which are  purchased separately, either standalone or on top of an existing voice subscription.  3.1.4 Thresholds  The threshold for annual summary reporting is based on the duration and the number of users of a  service affected as a percentage of the national user base of the service.  NRAs should send an incident report, as part of the annual summary reporting, if the incident:   lasts more than an hour, and the percentage of users affected is higher than 15 %,   lasts more than 2 hours, and the percentage of users affected is higher than 10 %,   lasts more than 4 hours, and the percentage of users affected is higher than 5 %,   lasts more than 6 hours, and the percentage of users affected is higher than 2 %, or if it   lasts more than 8 hours, and the percentage of users affected is higher than 1 %.  1 h  <...<2 h  2 h  <...<4 h  4 h  <...<6 h  6 h  <...<8 h  >8 h  1%<...< 2% of user base  2%<...< 5% of user base  5%<...< 10% of user base  10%<...< 15% of user base  > 15% of user base  Figure 2 Threshold for annual summary reporting based on a combination of duration and the percentage of the national user base.  The threshold should be understood ‘per service’. In other words, if one incident involves impact on  multiple services, then for one of the services the threshold should be passed in order to trigger the  reporting mechanism. NRAs may also report incidents with impact graded below the threshold.  For 2013, we introduced a new optional threshold for annual summary reporting, based on absolute  impact, in order to allow NRAs in large Member States to include larger incidents but that would not  exceed the relative thresholds. NRAs may optionally include incidents when the product of duration  and number of user connections affected exceeds 180 million user minutes, or 3 million user hours.  For next year’s reporting, about the 2014 incidents, this absolute threshold has been lowered and  becomes mandatory.  2 Reference is made to the definition agreed in the COCOM meetings.  Annual Incident Reports 2013  Analysis of Article 13a annual incident reports  September 2014  5  3.1.5 Root cause categories  In the incident reports four categories of root causes have been distinguished plus one category that  is used in conjunction with one of the other four categories.   Natural phenomena – This category includes incidents caused by severe weather,  earthquakes, floods, pandemic diseases, wildfires, wildlife, and so on.   Human errors - This category includes incidents caused by errors committed by employees of  the provider or outside the provider, during the operation of equipment or facilities, the use  of tools, the execution of procedures, etc. E.g. an excavator cutting off a cable.   Malicious attacks - This category includes incidents caused by a deliberate act by someone or  some organisation, e.g. a cyber-attack or a cable theft.   System failures – This category includes incidents caused by failures of a system, for example  hardware failures, software failures or flaws in manuals, procedures or policies.   Third party failures – This category includes incidents caused by a failure or incident at a third  party. This category is used in conjunctions with one of the other root cause categories.  Annual Incident Reports 2013  Analysis of Article 13a annual incident reports  September 2014  6  4 Analysis of the incidents  In total, all 28 EU Member States participated in this process. Of these, 18 countries and one EFTA  Member State reported in total 90 significant incidents, 9 countries reported there were no significant  incidents and one country had not implemented incident reporting yet.  The two pie charts to the right show the situation the previous two years. In the rest of this report we  show, besides the data about the 2013 incidents, figures and diagrams from the previous two years,  to allow the reader to make a comparison.  In this section the  In this section, the 90 reported incidents are aggregated and analysed. First, the impact per service is  analysed (in Section 4.1 ), then the impact per root cause category is analysed (Section 4.2), and in  Section 4.3  detailed causes are examined. In Section 4.3 impact as a product of user connections  affected and duration of the incidents is analysed and in Section 4.5 the components or assets affected  by the incidents are considered. Throughout the text we provide anonymized descriptions (in blue  italic) of actual large-scale incidents which occurred in 2013.  Note about statistical conclusions: Readers should be cautious when drawing conclusions from the  statistics in this report. In particular, they should take into account that:  1. The scope of reporting major security incidents is restricted to incidents with an impact on the  continuity of public electronic communication services and networks. There are many other  types of incidents with an impact on security of services and networks which are not in scope  of annual reporting. For example, if attackers would wiretap undersea cables without causing  any outages, then such a security incident would not be included in the annual reporting.  2. We are still in the early phases of implementation of Article 13a. There are still changes and  improvements in the way national and EU reporting is being implemented. Statistical  conclusions about multi-annual trends should therefore be drawn with care.  3. The scope of reporting includes only major, or significant, incidents scoring above the agreed  thresholds. Smaller incidents are not reported at an EU level and this means that the view is  skewed towards the larger incidents.  2011  19  9  1 Number of countries reporting significant incidents  Number of countries reporting no significant incidents  Number of countries without Article 13a implementation  Figure 3: Countries involved in the annual summary reporting over 2013.  2012  Annual Incident Reports 2013  Analysis of Article 13a annual incident reports  September 2014  7  4.1 Impact of incidents  We focus first on the impact of incidents on the electronic communications networks and services.  4.1.1 Impact per service  Approximately half of the reported incidents affected mobile internet or mobile telephony, as was the  case in 2012 and in 2013.  Most incidents have an impact on two or more services (which is why the percentages in the chart  add up to 149 %). National thresholds for reporting are per service and a percentage of the total  national user base for that service. So this would suggest that mobile services are more at risk of large  outages than fixed services.  Faulty network update caused mobile telephony and mobile Internet to fail (duration: hours,  connections: millions, cause: system failure): A planned network upgrade was done at night for mobile  phone call services. After the upgrade, customers’ call and data services failed. Because the change  was made to call and not data services, the cause of the failure was difficult to locate. The problem  occurred to users under one Radio Network Controller (RNC), but not all of them, which rendered  locating the cause even harder.  2011 2012  Figure 4: Incidents per service (percentage)  29  19  48 53  Fixed telephony Fixed Internet Mobile Telephony Mobile Internet  Annual Incident Reports 2013  Analysis of Article 13a annual incident reports  September 2014  8  4.1.2 Number of user connections affected  Mobile Internet outages affected on average 1.4 million user connections per incident. Incidents with  an impact on mobile telephony affected on average 700 000 user connections.  The difference between fixed and mobile may partly be due to the fact that some of the impacted  components, we call them assets, in the mobile networks, were more centrally located parts of the  networks as compared to the failed assets for fixed services, thus affecting more user connections per  incident.  EU averages shown here are not representative of the size of incidents nationally. The averages in  these diagrams include both small and large countries. Nationally, the average size of incidents can be  very different, depending on the size of the population and/or the national network topology.  200 100  700  1400  Fixed telephony Fixed Internet Mobile Telephony Mobile Internet  2011 2012  Figure 5: Average number of user connections affected per incident per service (1000s).  Annual Incident Reports 2013  Analysis of Article 13a annual incident reports  September 2014  9  4.1.3 Percentage of the national user base affected  Mobile Internet outages impacted about 9 % of the national user base for mobile Internet user  connections on average, a significant portion of the national user base. Each year there has been a  drop in failed user connections for all services, but it should be noted that a larger share of smaller  incidents have been reported year by year. All three years, mobile Internet has been reported to suffer  the most impact in terms of affected user connections compared to the other services.  Faulty upgrade in router caused mobile Internet to fail (duration: hours, connections: thousands,  cause: system failure): Disruption of connection of mobile data sessions was caused by a failed  upgrade of hardware and software in a router.  4.1.4 Impact on emergency services  One fifth of the incidents involved an impact on emergency calls - i.e. the possibility for users to  contact emergency call-centres using the emergency number 112. Compared to previous years this  figure is at its lowest.  4 5 5  9  Fixed telephony Fixed Internet Mobile Telephony Mobile Internet  Figure 7: Impact on emergency calls.  2011 2012  2011  Figure 6: Percentage of national user base affected on average per incident per service.  2012  21  79  Affected Not affected  Annual Incident Reports 2013  Analysis of Article 13a annual incident reports  September 2014  10  4.1.5 Impact on interconnections  In 4 % of the incidents there was an impact on interconnections between other providers.  This is the  lowest figure since annual summary reporting started.  4  96  Affected Not affected  Figure 8: Impact on interconnections  2011  2012  Annual Incident Reports 2013  Analysis of Article 13a annual incident reports  September 2014  11  4.2 Root cause categories  Now we look at the main root cause categories of reported incidents. Root cause categories are very  broad categories for incidents.  4.2.1 Incidents per root cause category  In 2013 about 61 % of the incidents were ‘System failures’, 19 % caused by ‘human errors’. Only 6 %  was categorized as ‘malicious actions’.  Over the last 3 years the root cause category ‘System failures’ has been the most common root cause  category.  Hardware failure caused interruptions to mobile Internet services (duration: hours, connections:  thousands, cause: system failure): A hardware failure on the transmission node (router) caused the  interruption of all data traffic between the Gateway GPRS Support Node (GGSN) and gateway router.  All mobile users who during the time of failure tried to access the Internet were affected.  2011  Figure 9: Incidents per root cause category (percentage).  2012  14  19  6  61  Natural phenomena  Human errors  Malicious actions  System failures  12  12  6 47  6 5  8  76  Annual Incident Reports 2013  Analysis of Article 13a annual incident reports  September 2014  12  4.2.2 Third party failures  About 11 % of the incidents reported were categorized as ‘third party failures’ (see Figure 10).  We analyse these third party failures in more detail and show the corresponding root cause category  in these cases (see Figure 11). Third party failures have similar root causes as incidents which are not  categorized as third party failures.  Cable cut caused mobile outage (duration: hours, connections: thousands, cause: third party and  human error): Mobile telephony and mobile Internet services were disrupted for thousands of users  for several hours when another operator was installing a cable and cut a cable of the former operator.  At the same time as the fault was located, the redundant connection also failed. The interface unit of  the redundant connection was reset, which returned the services for customers. The cable cut was fixed  and the traffic was rerouted back to the original route.  18  27  9  45  Natural phenomena  Human errors  Malicious actions  System failures  Figure 10: Third party failures and non-third party failures of all incidents (percentages).  89  11  Non third party failures Third party failures  Figure 11: Third party root causes (percentage).  Annual Incident Reports 2013  Analysis of Article 13a annual incident reports  September 2014  13  4.2.3 Root cause categories per service  Here we look at the root causes for each of the four services separately: fixed telephony, fixed Internet  access, mobile telephony and mobile Internet access.  In 2013, most of the incidents with an impact on fixed telephony and fixed Internet were caused by  natural phenomena. Most of the incidents with an impact on mobile telephony and mobile Internet  were categorized as System failures.  2011  Figure 12: Root cause categories for fixed telephony (percentage).  2011  2012  Figure 13: Root cause categories for fixed Internet (percentage).  12  6  18  18  7 14  76  5 5  25  60  47  12  18  24  Fixed Internet  Natural phenomena  Human errors  Malicious actions  System failures  18  99  18  2012  38  31  4  27  Fixed telephony  Natural phenomena  Human errors  Malicious actions  System failures  Annual Incident Reports 2013  Analysis of Article 13a annual incident reports  September 2014  14  2011  Figure 15: Root cause categories for mobile Internet (percentage).  2012  2011  Figure 14: Root cause categories for mobile telephony (percentage).  2012  20  7 57  28  12  2  58  Mobile Telephony  Natural phenomena  Human errors  Malicious actions  System failures  20  7 3  47  10 5  13 64  21  17  4  58  Mobile Internet  Natural phenomena  Human errors  Malicious actions  System failures  11 3  87  Annual Incident Reports 2013  Analysis of Article 13a annual incident reports  September 2014  15  4.2.4 Average duration of incidents per root cause category  Incidents caused by natural phenomena had a long recovery time on average per incident (54 hours).  This year the average incident duration for malicious actions was also high (53 hours). It should be  mentioned, however, that the figure was skewed by one particular incident which took very long to  resolve (164 hours). Overall natural phenomena caused the longest outages for all three years.  DDoS attack on DNS servers causing Internet unavailability (duration: days, connections: thousands,  cause: malicious action): The DNS of some Internet service providers were DDoS attacked causing  Internet access to be practically unavailable for 150 000 users for 2 hours.  Theft attempt caused cable cut to carrier network (duration: days, connections: thousands, cause:  malicious action): An attempted theft of copper resulted in the cutting of 12 cables, each containing  over 100 fibres. The incident occurred on the same street as the Point of Presence (PoP) site for the  national carrier network resulting in a failure of all resilient service options.  Storm shut down Power supply causing mobile networks to fail (duration: days, connection:  thousands, cause: natural phenomena and third party failure): A storm hit the country damaging  trees, affecting the power grid and all mobile networks within the storm area. The impact was limited  to urban areas but its effect was more long lasting in rural areas. The base stations ran out of battery  and were left without power. Also some fixed lines were affected.  4.2.5 Average number of user connections affected per root cause category  We now show the number of user connections affected per incident for each of the different root  cause categories. We are showing user connections affected and not users affected, because a single  consumer often has access to multiple services, for example fixed telephony and mobile telephony,  54  9  53  7  Natural phenomena  Human errors  Malicious actions  System failures  2011 2012  Figure 16: Average duration of incidents per root cause category (hours).  Annual Incident Reports 2013  Analysis of Article 13a annual incident reports  September 2014  16  which may all fail in the same incident. So the number of user connections impacted is often a multiple  of the number of users impacted.  System failures affected most user connections; on average over 1.5 million user connections per  incident.  Comparing with the analysis of the duration, this means that incidents caused by malicious actions  lasted very long (over 50 hours) but the number of user connections impacted in these incidents was  relatively limited (on around 100 000 user connections).  2011 2012  Figure 17: Average number of user connections affected per incident per root cause (1000s)  430  690  110  1500  Natural phenomena  Human errors  Malicious actions  System failures  Annual Incident Reports 2013  Analysis of Article 13a annual incident reports  September 2014  17  4.2.6 User hours lost per root cause category  Last year we started to look at the impact in terms of user hours lost. Taking into account both the  number of user connections affected and the duration of the incident yields a measure for the total  impact of an incident. We call it ‘user hours lost’. Natural phenomena had most impact in terms of  user hours lost. This suggests that this is the category of outages which affects most users most of the  time. At the same time, it is important to remember that these numbers are only representative of  large scale incidents, because small incidents remain below the thresholds.  Severe storm affecting power supply and mobile networks causing large scale mobile outage  (duration: days, connections: thousands, cause: natural phenomena and third party failure): A deep  low-pressure with storms and hurricane winds caused power outages, damaged transmission lines to  mobile sites and damaged access networks. Hundreds of GSM and LTE sites and thousands of UMTS  sites were affected, with some lasting longer than 72 hours.  Figure 18: Average user hours lost per incident per root cause category.  23000  6000  5600  1100  Natural phenomena  Human errors  Malicious actions  System failures  2012  Annual Incident Reports 2013  Analysis of Article 13a annual incident reports  September 2014  18  4.3 Detailed causes  Root cause categories are rather broad. In this section we look at the detailed causes of incidents. The  detailed causes give a better overview of what are technically the causes of incidents.  To explain the difference between root cause categories and detailed causes: Take for example an  incident in which a storm leads to a power cut which leads to an outage. For this incident both storm  and power cut are detailed causes.  4.3.1 Detailed causes of all incidents  In 2013, the most common causes of incidents were ‘software bug’ and ‘hardware failure’. This was  also the case for the previous two years. Also ‘power cut’ was among the top four causes during all  three years. For the 2013 reporting, we added ‘software misconfiguration’ as a cause, which turned  out to be a significant cause of incidents3.  Outage for mobile Internet users caused by hard disc failure (duration: hours, connections:  thousands, cause: hardware failure):  A hard disc failure occurred on one of the Serving GPRS Support  Nodes (SGSN) when swapping over to a backup image on a redundant disc. All connectivity was lost to  the SGSN leaving hundreds of thousands subscribers without mobile Internet access for eight hours.  3 The list of causes has been fine-tuned if compared with past editions of this Report. For example, the cause  hardware/software failure (2011) was split in 2012, and the causes software misconfiguration, hardware  misconfiguration, fire and wildfire were added for the 2013 reporting.  38  23  13 11 9 6 6 4 3 1 1 1 1 1 1 1  Figure 19: Detailed causes of reported incidents (percentage)  2012  29 29  19 14  8 7 6 6 4 4 4 3 3 2 2 1 1 1 1  41 20 14 10 6 6 4 4 4 2 2 2 2 2  2011  Annual Incident Reports 2013  Analysis of Article 13a annual incident reports  September 2014  19  4.3.2 Detailed causes per service  Now we split up the data about detailed causes for each of the four services (fixed telephony, fixed  Internet, mobile telephony and mobile Internet) - see figures 20, 21, 22 and 23 below. Many incidents  with an impact on fixed telephony and fixed Internet were caused by power cuts, and many incidents  with an impact on mobile Internet and mobile telephony were caused by hardware failures and  software bugs but also power cuts was a significant cause of failure.  31 17  10 10 7 3 3 3 3 3  Figure 20: Detailed causes for fixed telephony (percentage).  36 27  18 18 9 9 9  33  22 19  11 11 7 7 7 7  4 4  2011  2012 2011  Annual Incident Reports 2013  Analysis of Article 13a annual incident reports  September 2014  20  2012  Figure 22: Detailed causes for mobile telephony (percentage).  26 22  13 13 9 9 9 9  4 4 4 4  Figure 21: Detailed causes for fixed Internet (percentage).  35 24  18 12 12  6 6 6 6  2011  35 20 15  10 5 5 5 5 5 5 5  2012  35 28  16 12 9 7 7 5 5 5 5 2 2 2  52  26 10 10 6 6 6 3 3 3 3  2011  32 21  16 13 5 3 3 3 3 3 3 3  Annual Incident Reports 2013  Analysis of Article 13a annual incident reports  September 2014  21  2012  40  21 21 13  8 6 6 4 4 4 2 2 2 2  36  15 13 13 10 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3  2011  Figure 23: Detailed causes for mobile Internet (percentage).  43  27  10 10 7 7 3 3 3 3 3 3  2011  Annual Incident Reports 2013  Analysis of Article 13a annual incident reports  September 2014  22  4.3.3 Average duration of incidents per detailed cause  Last year we started to look at average duration of incidents, user connections affected and impact in  terms of duration times the user connections affected for the detailed causes.  Incidents caused by Fire and Heavy Snowfall had the longest duration (86 and 62 hours respectively)  followed by power cuts (53 hours) and Storms (47 hours).  Snowstorms caused mobile service outages (durations: days, connections: thousands, cause: heavy  snowfall): The weather conditions were unusually bad for five days causing outages to mobile  communications in 50 villages and smaller towns. 150 2G base stations and 50 3G stations all in all  went down.  86  62 53  47 44  23 13 10 10 10 9 5 5 5 4 3 3 3 2  2012  Figure 24: Average duration of incidents per detailed cause (hours).  84 72 72  36 22 14 10 9 8 8 8 8 6 5 3 3  Annual Incident Reports 2013  Analysis of Article 13a annual incident reports  September 2014  23  4.3.4 Average number of user connections affected per detailed cause  Software bugs were the cause affecting most user connections (more than 2.4 million connections on  average per incident) followed by power surges and bad maintenance with 2 million and 1.2 million  affected connections respectively.  Software bug caused outage for millions of mobile Internet users nationally (duration: hours,  connections: millions, cause: software bug): Mobile data transmission services failed for three million  users for several hours caused by the database for tariff management running out of memory space.  Due to a software bug, no memory storage alerts were submitted and the services provided by the  database could not be automatically restarted.

Also in 2012 Power cuts had high impact. Cyber-attacks did not have any  significant impact on electronic communications during 2013.  Power failure caused service failure for virtual mobile operator (duration: hours, connections:  thousands, cause: power failure):  Loss of primary and secondary power to the data centre of a Mobile Virtual Network Operator caused  a loss of voice and data connections. After reinstating the primary circuit breaker, power was restored  and subsequent actions returned the equipment to full service.  40466  18635 18360 13960 13314  11544 11228 10223 6324 6000 4752 4400 3092 3068 2197 1824 1680 526 450  Figure 26: Average user hours lost per incident per detailed cause.  2012  77161 69941  60612  21600 12893  4689 4608 3432 3000 2700 2352 2061 2042 1526 1471 223  Annual Incident Reports 2013  Analysis of Article 13a annual incident reports  September 2014  25  4.4 Assets affected  For the second year we received reports from NRAs about which components or assets of the  electronic communications networks were affected by the incidents. This provides some more  information about the nature of the outages and what assets of the infrastructure that were primarily  involved in them.  4.4.1 Assets affected overall  Base stations and controllers were the assets most affected, followed by Switches. Also in 2012 Base  stations and Switches were in the top three in terms of assets affected.  Power cuts due to bad weather shut down mobile base stations (duration: days, connections:  thousands, causes: power cut): A severe storm caused long lasting power cuts leading to mobile  communication base stations shutting down. Also communication cables had physical breaks. Over  200 2G and 100 3G base stations became non-operational for about four days.  20 16  14 9 9  6 6 3 3  1 1 1 1  Figure 27: Assets affected by the incidents (percentage).  2012  20 19  13 11  9 7  4 4 4 4 2 2 2 1  Annual Incident Reports 2013  Analysis of Article 13a annual incident reports  September 2014  26  4.4.2 Affected assets in system failures  System failure was the most common root cause category for all incidents in 2013. In these system  failures the most often affected assets were the Mobile Switching Centres (MSC), the switches and  routers, and the base stations.  Switching server failure caused mobile outage (duration: hours, connections: thousands, cause:  system failure): Due to a failure in a switching server, mobile communications (2G and 3G) became  unavailable in a large part of the country.

Both PSTN and VoIP  were mostly affected by storms. PSTN was also affected by hardware failure, and on third place power  cuts and flood, whereas VoIP was evenly affected by hardware failure, software bugs, bad change and  flooding. Figure 29 shows the overall picture of the causes, for incidents affecting PSTN and VoIP  services.  12  4  31  4 8 8  19  4 4 4 44 4  15  4 4 0  19  0 4 4  0  PSTN VoIP  14  3 3 0 0  10  3  14 10  0  7 10 10  3  PSTN VoIP  2012  Figure 29: Detailed causes for incidents affecting PSTN and VoIP (percentage).  Annual Incident Reports 2013  Analysis of Article 13a annual incident reports  September 2014  28  5 Conclusions  In this Report ENISA summarized how the incident reporting scheme, mandated by Article 13a of the  Framework Directive (2009/140/EC), was implemented across the EU and analysed incident reports  from 2013. ENISA and the Commission received as part of the third round of reporting from the  National Regulatory Authorities 90 reports about major incidents that occurred in 2013.  From the 90 significant incidents reported to ENISA and the European Commission, the following  conclusions can be drawn.   Mobile networks most affected: Most incidents affected mobile Internet followed by mobile  telephony (53 % and 48 % respectively).   Mobile network outages affect many users: Incidents affecting mobile Internet or mobile  telephony affected most users (around 1.4 million users and 700 000 users respectively per  incident). This is consistent with the high penetration rate of mobile telephony and mobile  Internet.   Emergency Services are affected by incidents: In 21 % of the incidents there was impact on  emergency calls using the emergency number 112.   System failures are the most common root cause: Most incidents were caused by root causes  in the category system failures (61 % of the incidents). This was the most common root cause  category for mobile networks. In the category system failures, software bugs and hardware  failures were the most common causes. The assets most often affected by system failures  were switches (e.g. mobile switching and routers) and base stations and controllers.   System failures affect many users: Incidents categorized with the root cause system failures,  affected around 1.5 million user connections on average per incident. Incidents involving the  detailed cause software bug affected around 2.5 million connections on average per incident.   Natural phenomena and malicious actions cause long lasting incidents: Incidents caused by  natural phenomena (mainly storms and heavy snowfalls) and malicious actions lasted on  average 54 and 53 hours respectively.   Power cuts and heavy snowfall have most impact: Incidents caused by power cuts followed  by heavy snowfall respectively had most impact in terms of number of user connections  affected multiplied by the duration of the incident.   Base stations and Switches most affected by incidents: Overall, base stations, switches and  mobile switching were the network components most affected by incidents.  Based on the annual summary reporting of 2011 and 2012 incidents, ENISA analysed in 2013 the  dependencies in the electronic communications sector on power supply and issued recommendations  regarding the sector’s ability to withstand and act efficiently after power cuts. ENISA also studied in  2013 national roaming for increased resilience in mobile networks. This year, based on the annual  summary reporting of 2012 and 2013 incidents, ENISA is issuing recommendations for providers about  how to manage security requirements for vendors and outsourcing partners they use for their core  operations. Based on the 2012 and 2013 summary reporting ENISA is also studying national initiatives  to reduce the number of under-ground cable breaks caused by mistakes.  ENISA, in the context of the Article 13a Expert Group, will discuss specific incidents in more detail with  the NRAs, and if needed, discuss and agree on mitigating measures.  ENISA would like to take this opportunity to thank the NRAs, Ministries and the European Commission  for a fruitful collaboration and we look forward to leveraging this kind of reporting to further improve  the security and resilience of the electronic communications sector in the EU and more generally for  supervision of security also in other critical sectors. The next annual report will be published in  summer 2015, for the 2014 incidents.  http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32009L0140:en:NOT http://www.enisa.europa.eu/media/press-releases/new-report-on-power-supply-dependencies http://www.enisa.europa.eu/media/press-releases/using-national-roaming-to-mitigate-mobile-network-outages201d-new-report-by-eu-cyber-security-agency-enisa https://resilience.enisa.europa.eu/article-13  Annual Incident Reports 2013  Analysis of Article 13a annual incident reports  September 2014  29  References  Related ENISA papers   The Article 13a EG technical guidelines on incident reporting and on security measures:  https://resilience.enisa.europa.eu/article-13   ENISA’s reports about the 2011 and 2012 incidents, reported under Article 13a:  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/Incidents-reporting/annual- reports   ENISA’s study 2013 on Power Supply Dependencies in the Electronic Communications  Sector: http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/Incidents- reporting/power-supply-dependencies   ENISA’s study 2013 on National Roaming for Resilience:  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/Incidents-reporting/national- roaming-for-resilience   ENISA’s whitepaper on cyber incident reporting in the EU shows Article 13a and how it  compares to some other security articles mandating incident reporting and security  measures: http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/Incidents- reporting/cyber-incident-reporting-in-the-eu   For the interested reader, ENISA’s 2009 paper on incident reporting shows an overview of  the situation in the EU 5 years ago: http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and- CIIP/Incidents-reporting/good-practice-guide-on-incident-reporting/good-practice-guide-on- incident-reporting-1  EU legislation   Article 13a of the Framework directive of the EU legislative framework on electronic  communications:  http://ec.europa.eu/information_society/policy/ecomm/doc/140framework.pdf   The electronic communications regulatory framework (incorporating the telecom reform):  http://ec.europa.eu/information_society/policy/ecomm/doc/library/regframeforec_dec200 9.pdf   An overview of the main elements of the 2009 reform:  http://ec.europa.eu/information_society/policy/ecomm/tomorrow/reform/index_en.htm   In 2013 the European Commission issued a European Cyber Security Strategy and proposed  a directive on Cyber Security.

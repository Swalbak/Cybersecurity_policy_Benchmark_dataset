The ultimate goals behind these ideas are to ensure that cybersecurity is an enabler and not  an inhibitor of a more efficient market whilst continuing to to encourage the establishment of a high level of  cybersecurity across all industry segments.  The essential arguments are structured as follows:   A brief review of macroeconomic and microeconomic  drivers for cybersecurity in the EU is presented.   The current policy context is then summarised   Areas in which ENISA could contribute to the DSM are presented and discussed.  2 Macroeconomic Considerations  A small number of new technologies (such as big data, mobile computing and cloud) are revolutionizing IT  markets and enabling new trends in the IT market. Whilst these trends can rightly be seen as economic  enablers they also present significant cybersecurity challenges. If the EU fails to respond to these challenges,  it could sacrifice up to €640bn of potential EU economic value.  The EU Cybersecurity Market is estimated at €20.1bn and compares favourably with the cybersecurity market  of other global regions. The Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of the EU market however is 6%, whereas  the average growth rate is around 8%, and is growing slower than all other major regions.  3 Microeconomic Considerations  From a microeconomic perspective, cybersecurity maturity of large European companies is approximately  equivalent to those in other regions. Interestingly, large European companies are typically more concerned  about cyber security related risks than rest of world. Matching the global growth forecast would increase the  European market by EUR 1.0 bn in 2018. In parallel, ITSEC professionals in the EU are forecast to grow at 6%  p.a., which could grow the workforce by up to 0.3m jobs in 2018.  The rapid development of new technologies however has made it clear that traditional approaches to Cyber  Security are insufficient. Security concerns are slowing adoption of some technologies, especially mobile and  cloud, which is preventing the EU from making the most of innovation to boost its economic efficiency.  4 EU Cybersecurity policy & legislation  Although there have been many policy initiatives related to cybersecurity over the past five years, the EU  Cybersecurity Strategy, the NIS Directive and the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) are the most  significant developments in terms of impact on ENISA’s work. These policy developments however are not  particularly linked to EU economic policy.  Cybersecurity as an Economic Enabler  External |  V1.1  |  March 2016  02  The Digital Single Market (DSM) initiative on the other hand clearly deals with market issues and includes a  cybersecurity component. The comments in this paper can be seen as ideas for supporting the DSM strategy.  5 Engaging with Industry to Support the Digital Single Market  For the vast majority of its deliverables, ENISA achieves impact by working together with industry and the  public sector to identify issues and propose  acceptable solutions. This approach enables the Agency to  achieve scalability (by leveraging experts in the member States) and results in a greater sense of ownership by  the target communities. In this sense, ENISA is continually fostering public-private cooperation.  ENISA believes that the EU needs to become the single market of preference for governments and industry  where cybersecurity is concerned. Achieving this will require the EU to achieve a reasonable balance between  strong ethical principles and effective business practices that could more effectively stimulate economic  growth. Given the key role of modern technology in supporting future growth, cybersecurity should be an  integral part of the EU industrial policy approach. ENISA will continue to promote and support such an  approach in the area of cybersecurity by providing the platform to bring together public and private sector.  6 Cybersecurity Issues in the Digital Single Market  The following tables identifies a number of key cybersecurity issues that are associated with the Digital Single  market and proposes a number of mechanisms for resolving them.  Issue Proposed Resolution Mechanisms  Current attempts to improve NIS throughout the EU  often do not achieve an optimal balance between  opportunity and risk. This reduces the effectiveness  of the overall approach and increases costs for both  the public and private sector.   Assist the Commission and the Member States in  ensuring that EU cybersecurity strategy and EU  industrial policy are strongly aligned. Identify  areas where the EU is well positioned to be a  global leader and assist in defining long-term  plans for building up these competencies.   Promote industry to reason in terms of the  balance between opportunities and risks and  not just to concentrate on risk.  The internal market for security products and  services is not functioning correctly. The EU security  market is dominated by US companies and  functions on a ‘supply push’ principle rather than a  ‘demand pull’ principle.   Stimulate ‘collective demand’ by getting  different industry sectors to define security  requirements on a sector-by-sector basis. Use  these requirements to drive procurement  policies in these sectors.   Work together with industry to define and  disseminate security requirements adapted to  the needs of SMEs.  The area of privacy and data protection is moving  from a legal and principle-based debate to an  implementation phase.  The EU has a strong policy  in this area but is very weak in terms of  implemented solutions.   Help the Commission and Member States to  move the privacy and data protection debate  towards implementation strategies.   Identify existing methods and tools that could  be used to implement the proposals of the  regulation.  Cybersecurity as an Economic Enabler  External |  V1.1  |  March 2016  03  Current EU research & development activities in the  area of cybersecurity are not giving rise to  successful services and products .   Work together with universities and EU  cybersecurity companies to define and  implement a framework for rapid  implementation of EU research ideas in industry  environments. Ensure a feedback mechanism to  enable research to improve products together  with industry.   ENISA should be given a stronger role in H2020  projects in the area of NIS. In order to achieve  scalability, the ENISA regulation should be  changed so as to allow the Agency to receive  funds for this.  Cybersecurity standardisation and certification  activities are not sufficiently aligned with modern  needs of the industry.   ENISA should proactively foster the  development of relevant standards by active  participation in ISO, ETSI, CEN/CENELEC and  other relevant standardisation groups.   Promote certification schemes by active  contribution to initiatives such as the SOGIS1  group and facilitate industry involvement.  Knowledge and skills related to network and  information security are developed and maintained  in a fragmented manner. There is no coherent  approach for educating citizens, private sector and  government.   Work together with schools, universities and  professional associations to create a coherent  framework for raising awareness and education  in NIS. Assist industry in aligning skill sets with  career paths.  The EU has many agencies in the area of ICT and  security  : EU Lisa, Frontex, Europol/EC3, CEPOL,  Eurojust, EEAS, EDA, ENISA.   Future EU policies, legislation and programmes  should recognize the central coordination role of  ENISA in ensuring a coherent approach to  cybersecurity across the EU, both in terms of  Member States and in terms of communities.  7 Key Messages to Industry  In the light of the above comments, ENISA has published the following key messages to industry:  • Consider new business models that capitalise on security as a differentiator of products and services.  • Establish sectorial requirements for information security in order to move the cybersecurity market.  • Invest more in awareness and education on security at all levels.  • Reduce Operational Expenditure by Improving Risk Management.  • Secure the whole lifecycle of products by using security and privacy by design.  • Improve cooperation within and across industry segments and national borders to improve threat  intelligence and promote the application of good practices.  • Consider new business models that capitalise on security as a differentiator of products and services.  • Proactively drive standardisation through strong industry representation.  • Support cybersecurity and privacy certification schemes to improve customer confidence  • Collaborate with academia to ensure that quality research results in concrete products and services.  1 http://www.sogisportal.eu",

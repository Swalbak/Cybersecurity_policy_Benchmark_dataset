Questions to ask Managed Service Providers  Are you implementing better practice cyber security?  The Essential Eight from the Strategies to Mitigate Cyber Security Incidents  provides prioritised and practical advice  to manage a range of cyber threats to systems and the information that they process, store or communicate.  Managed service providers can demonstrate they are implementing better practice cyber security to protect  themselves and their customers by implementing the Essential Eight.  Are you securely administering your systems and services?  As managed service providers often have privileged access to systems, it is important that they manage such systems in  a secure manner, especially when systems are managed remotely.  Managed service providers can demonstrate they are securely administering their systems and services by  implementing the guidance from the Secure Administration publication.  Are you monitoring activity on your systems and services?  Organisations often have poor visibility of activity occurring on their systems. Good visibility of what is happening is  important for both detecting and responding to targeted cyber intrusions and malicious insiders.  Managed service providers can demonstrate they are monitoring activity on their systems and services by  implementing the guidance from the Windows Event Logging and Forwarding  publication.  Are you regularly assessing your systems and services?  In order to protect their systems, and that of their customers, it is important that managed service providers are aware  of, and appropriately risk manage, security vulnerabilities in their systems and services.  Managed service providers can demonstrate they are regularly assessing their systems and services by conducting  regular vulnerability assessment activities.

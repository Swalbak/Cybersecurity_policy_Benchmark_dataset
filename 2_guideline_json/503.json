This draft  Directive still needs to be polished, but a preliminary version is already available. Articles and paragraphs  referred to in this document refer to the draft version of the Directive mentioned here. The final text is  expected in spring. This document will be adjusted should the NIS Directive change.  This note explains the structure of the Directive, and highlights the parts that are relevant to National  CSIRTs. For easier reading we refer to national CSIRTs in the context of this document simply as “CSIRT” or  “dedicated CSIRT”.  2 Structure of the Directive  The Directive is structured around the following sections. More specific provisions directly targeted to  CSIRTs (mainly from Chapter 3 and Annex 1) will follow in Section 3:  Recitals give the context in which the Directive works. They state the importance and specificities of  Network and Information Security, and describe the actors that will need to play a role.  Chapter 1. General provisions. This Chapter describes the goals of the Directive, and its legislative  environment. It also gives formal definitions to terms that appear in the text.  Chapter 2. National frameworks on NIS. This Chapter lists the different entities and legislative frameworks  that each Member State will have to set up in order to comply with the Directive. Each MS needs to adopt  a national NIS strategy; designate one or more national competent authorities, as well as a single point of  contact for cross-border cooperation; and set up at least one Computer Security Incident Response Team  (CSIRT). These teams need to cover certain sectors and services.  Chapter 3. Cooperation between competent authorities. This Chapter defines two groups meant to improve  NIS-related cooperation between MS. The first is the Cooperation Network, composed of representatives of  MS, the Commission, and ENISA. This group is meant to focus on strategic issues. The second group is the  CSIRT Network, composed of representatives of MS’ CSIRT and CERT-EU, with the Commission as observer  and ENISA as Secretary and active support.  Chapter 4. Security of the NIS of operators of essential services. This Chapter defines security requirements  for and duties of operators of essential services. These services are described in Annex 2 of the Directive.  Chapter 4a. Security of the NIS of digital service providers. This Chapter defines security requirements for  and duties of digital service providers. These providers are described in Annex 3 of the Directive.  Chapter 4b. Standardisation. This Chapter encourages the use of EU standards.  Chapter 5. Final provisions. This Chapter covers all other aspects, like the details the timeline for  transposition of the Directive, or penalties.  Annex 1. Requirements and tasks of the CSIRT. This Annex gives a list of tasks that a MS’ CSIRT has to  perform.  http://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2015/12/18-cybersecurity-agreement/  NIS Directive and national CSIRTs  TLP WHITE  |  Info Note  |  Final  |  February 2016  © European Union Agency for Network and Information Security (ENISA), 2016  02  Annex 2. Sectors and entities. This Annex lists the sectors and subsectors that need to be covered by each  country’s Information Security Strategy and CSIRTs.  Annex 3. Types of digital services. This Annex lists the digital services targeted by the Directive.  3 CSIRTs  Article 7 of the Directive gives the framework for CSIRTs. The following table presents each paragraph, and  if necessary comments on what it means for the relevant CSIRTs.  PARAGRAPH STATEMENT MEANING  1  Each Member State shall designate one or more  Computer Security Incident Response Teams (hereinafter:  \"CSIRTs \") covering at least the sectors referred to in  Annex II and types of digital services referred to in Annex  III, responsible for handling incidents and risks according  to a well-defined process, which shall comply with the  requirements set out in point (1) of Annex I. A CSIRT may  be established within a competent authority.  Each MS will designate one or more CSIRT. Together,  these CSIRTs need to cover the sectors and services listed  in Annex II and III.  The designated CSIRT(s) need to fulfil the requirements  and tasks listed in Annex I. This is one of the places where  the Directive points to “adequate resources and  equipment” for the CSIRT.  1a  Where they are separate, the competent authority, the  single point of contact and the CSIRTs of the same  Member State shall cooperate with regard to the  obligations laid down in this Directive. Where a Member  State decides that CSIRTs shall not receive notifications,  the CSIRTs shall, to the extent necessary to fulfil their  tasks, be granted access to data on incidents notified by  operators of essential services pursuant to Article 14(2)  and (2ac) or by digital service providers pursuant to Article  15a(2).  The Directive does not impose a structure or hierarchy for  the competent authority, the single point of contact and  the CSIRTs. They may be together in one organisation, or  be separate. What matters is that, together, they have to  fulfil the obligations defined by the Directive. Each  Member State will have to come up with the structure  that suits them.  The designated CSIRTs are entitled to data on incidents  notified by operators of essential services and providers of  digital services.  2  Member States shall ensure that the designated CSIRTs  have adequate resources to effectively carry out their  tasks set out in point (2) of Annex I.  The designated CSIRTs are entitled to sufficient resources,  which need to be provided by the respective government  of the Member State. This is the second time the Directive  points to “adequate resources and equipment” for the  CSIRT  3  Member States shall ensure that the designated CSIRTs  have access to an appropriate, secure, and resilient  communication and information infrastructure at national  level.  The third time the Directive points to “adequate resources  and equipment” for the CSIRT  4  Member States shall inform the Commission about the  remit as well as the main elements of the incident  handling process of the CSIRTs.  CSIRTs need to document their constituencies and  services. They also will need to provide a high level  overview of their incident handling process to the  Commission.  The practical details as to how this will happen are not  defined yet, however a good start is that the team  publishes an RFC2350-compliant document  (https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2350).  5c  Member States may request the assistance of ENISA in  developing national CSIRTs.  CSIRTs can get ENISA’s help either to set up their  operations, integrate in the community, or ask for  https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2350  NIS Directive and national CSIRTs  TLP WHITE  |  Info Note  |  Final  |  February 2016  © European Union Agency for Network and Information Security (ENISA), 2016  03  PARAGRAPH STATEMENT MEANING  training. Please contact cert-relations@enisa.europa.eu  for more details.  4 The CSIRT Network  Article 8b of the Directive covers the CSIRT Network.  PARAGRAPH STATEMENT MEANING  1  In order to contribute to developing confidence and trust  between the Member States and to promote swift and  effective operational cooperation, a network of the  national CSIRTs is hereby established.  There will be a dedicated network for all national CSIRTs  established, run by the MS (with the help of ENISA) and  secretariat provided by ENISA.  2  The CSIRTs network shall be composed of representatives  of the Member States’ CSIRTs and CERT-EU. The  Commission shall participate in the CSIRTs network as an  observer. The European Network and Information Security  Agency (ENISA) shall provide the secretariat and actively  support the cooperation among the CSIRTs.  ENISA is there to support the group and its members. The  Agency will provide resources and input to discussions.  3 The CSIRTs network shall have the following tasks:  Exactly how the group will perform these tasks is up to the  group itself, as stated by paragraph 5. It means that the  group will determine its own priorities, with input from  the Collaboration Group. ENISA will support the group by  making appropriate proposals.  3a  Exchange information on CSIRTs services, operations and  cooperation capabilities  (see comment for paragraph 3)  3b  At the request of the representative of a Member State  potentially affected by an incident, exchange and discuss  non-commercially sensitive information related to that  incident and associated risks. Any Member State may  refuse to contribute to that discussion if there is a risk of  prejudice to the investigation of the incident.  (see comment for paragraph 3)  3c  Exchange and make available on a voluntary basis non- confidential information on individual incidents.  (see comment for paragraph 3)  3d  At the request of the representative of a Member State's  CSIRT, discuss and, where possible, identify a coordinated  response to an incident that has been identified within the  jurisdiction of that same Member State.  (see comment for paragraph 3)  3e  Support Member States in addressing cross-border  incidents on the basis of their voluntary mutual  assistance.  (see comment for paragraph 3)  3f  Discuss, explore and identify further forms of operational  cooperation, including in relation to:  (i) categories of risks and incidents  (ii) early warnings  (see comment for paragraph 3)  mailto:cert-relations@enisa.europa.eu  NIS Directive and national CSIRTs  TLP WHITE  |  Info Note  |  Final  |  February 2016  © European Union Agency for Network and Information Security (ENISA), 2016  04  PARAGRAPH STATEMENT MEANING  (iii) mutual assistance  (iv) principles and modalities for coordination, when  Member States respond to cross border NIS risks and  incidents.  3g  Inform the Cooperation Group on its activities and on the  further forms of operational cooperation discussed  pursuant to paragraph 3(f), and request guidance related  thereto.  (see comment for paragraph 3)  3h  Discuss lessons learnt from NIS exercises, including from  those organised by ENISA.  (see comment for paragraph 3)  3i  At the request of an individual CSIRT, discuss the  capabilities and preparedness of that same CSIRT.  (see comment for paragraph 3)  3j  Issue guidelines in order to facilitate the convergence of  (operational) practices with regard to the application of  the provisions of this Article concerning operational  cooperation.  (see comment for paragraph 3)  4  As input to the Commission's periodic review of the  functioning of this Directive, the CSIRTs network shall  every one and a half years produce a report assessing the  experience gained with the operational cooperation,  including conclusions and recommendations, pursued  under this article. That report shall also be submitted to  the cooperation group.  The form and content of the report are not defined yet.  This will need to be negotiated between the CSIRT  network and the cooperation group.  ENISA will help producing the report, and the group will  have to approve it.  5  The CSIRTs network shall define its own rules of  procedure.  The group will need to determine its governance structure  and terms of reference. ENISA, as secretary and support,  can provide input to the group and come up with  proposals  5 Tasks for CSIRTs (Annex 1)  Annex 1 of the Directive gives basic requirements for designated CSIRTs, as well as a list tasks.  PARAGRAPH STATEMENT MEANING  Preamble  The requirements and tasks of the CSIRT shall be  adequately and clearly defined and supported by national  policy and/or regulation. They shall include the following  elements  This is a tool for designated CSIRTs to demand that their  mandate be officially published.  ENISA and others have long argued that an officially  recognised mandate is one of the very first steps for a  successful national CSIRT.  1 Requirements for the CSIRT  Article 1 is about operational requirements, and gives  arguments to request necessary budget, manpower, or  infrastructure.  1a  The CSIRTs shall ensure high availability of its  communications services by avoiding single points of  failure and have several means for being contacted and  for contacting others at all times. Furthermore, the  There are two parts to this requirement:  1. High availability of communication services.  Without further details, it’s hard to provide  NIS Directive and national CSIRTs  TLP WHITE  |  Info Note  |  Final  |  February 2016  © European Union Agency for Network and Information Security (ENISA), 2016  05  PARAGRAPH STATEMENT MEANING  communication channels shall be clearly specified and  well known to the constituency and cooperative partners  much guidance. In fine, it will be up to the CSIRT  Network to define what constitutes high  availability. ENISA will support the group by  making appropriate proposals.  2. Clear specification of communication channels.  RFC 2350 is the industry standard for publishing  contact information. ENISA recommends that all  participating CSIRTs publish such a document.  1c  The offices of the CSIRT and the supporting information  systems shall be located in secure sites.  The group will have to define what “secure site” means:  depending on the context, the range of measures that can  be taken is huge.  ENISA will support the group by making appropriate  proposals.  1e  Business continuity:  1. The CSIRT shall be equipped with an appropriate  system for managing and routing requests, in  order to facilitate handovers,  2. The CSIRT shall be adequately staffed to ensure  availability at all times,  3. The CSIRT shall rely on an infrastructure whose  continuity is ensured. To this end, redundant  systems and backup working space shall be  available.  1. This requirement can be translated as the need  for adequate tools to track incidents. There is a  variety of tools that CSIRTs can use. Popular  tools are RTIR, FIR, etc. More concrete  definitions are up to discussion within the CSIRT  network. ENISA will support these discussions by  making appropriate proposals.  2. See ENISA CSIRT maturity study as a first  pointer, but more concrete definitions are up to  discussion within the CSIRT network. ENISA will  support these discussions by making  appropriate proposals.  3. See 1a  1f  CSIRTS shall have the possibility to participate, where  appropriate, in international cooperation networks  We interpret this as a tool for designated CSIRTs to make  sure they have the necessary travel budget to take part in  existing communities like TF-CSIRT, FIRST, or EGC.  In order to contribute to that and make it easier for  designated CSIRTs, ENISA will try as much as possible to  co-locate physical meetings of the group with TF-CSIRT  meetings.  2 Tasks of the CSIRT  Article 2 is about what designated CSIRTs will have to do.  This should be considered as the minimum set of tasks for  designated CSIRTs.  2a  Tasks of the CSIRT shall include at least the following:  1. Monitoring incidents at a national level,  2. Providing early warning, alerts, announcements  and dissemination of information to relevant  stakeholders about risks and incidents,  3. Responding to incidents,  4. Providing dynamic risk and incident analysis and  situational awareness,  5. Participating in the CSIRT network  1. Monitoring is a generic term, and designated  CSIRTs will need to translate it to their own  context. ENISA plans to make monitoring the  topic of its Workshop for national and  governmental CSIRTs in May 2016.  2. This task amounts to providing the “Alerts and  Warnings” and “Announcements” services.  More information as to how a CSIRT can deliver  these services can be found in ENISA’s guides on  (Set up; Alerts-Warnings-Announcements?)  3. This is a basic requirement for CSIRTs. If  necessary, ENISA’s Incident Management Guide  can be of help.  https://www.bestpractical.com/rtir/ https://github.com/certsocietegenerale/FIR/blob/master/README.md https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/support/incident-management  NIS Directive and national CSIRTs  TLP WHITE  |  Info Note  |  Final  |  February 2016  © European Union Agency for Network and Information Security (ENISA), 2016  06  PARAGRAPH STATEMENT MEANING  4. Concrete definitions are up to discussion within  the CSIRT network. ENISA will support these  discussions by making appropriate proposals.  5. Participation, both online and in physical  meetings, is essential to build trust between the  members of the group.  2b  The CSIRT shall establish cooperative relationships with  private sector.  Collaboration with the private sector is required to handle  incidents efficiently. Designated CSIRTs will need to cover  at least the sectors specified in Annex II of the Directive,  however the group members will have to decide what  information they want to share with the private sector.  ENISA will support the group by making appropriate  proposals.  2c  To facilitate cooperation, the CSIRT shall promote the  adoption and use of common or standardised practises  for:  1. incident and risk handling procedures,  2. incident, risk and information classification  schemes.  More concrete definitions are up to discussion within the  CSIRT network. ENISA will support these discussions by  making appropriate proposals.  6 Conclusion  The advent of the NIS Directive is a significant event in the EU, because it is the first time NIS is tackled at  such a high level.  For designated CSIRTs, the Directive gives many arguments that will help them formalise their mandate as  well as secure budget, resources, and infrastructure.  The tasks given to the CSIRT network are varied, and it will be up to group members to define their own  rules and good practices. The group can help build further trust within CSIRTs in the EU, provided its  members take an active part.  ENISA will provide active support to the group, as Secretary, but also in helping teams come to meetings,  and by providing input for discussions and moderating debates if necessary.  About “Info Notes” from ENISA  With the “Info Notes” series ENISA aims at giving the interested reader some background and  recommendations about NIS related topics. The background and recommendations are derived from past  experiences and common sense, and should be taken as starting points for discussions on possible course  of action by relevant stakeholders. Feel free to get in touch with ENISA to discuss or inquire more  information on the “Info Notes” series (cert-relations@enisa.europa.eu).",

In order to contribute to that and make it easier for  designated CSIRTs, ENISA will try as much as possible to  co-locate physical meetings of the group with TF-CSIRT  meetings.  2 Tasks of the CSIRT  Article 2 is about what designated CSIRTs will have to do.  This should be considered as the minimum set of tasks for  designated CSIRTs.  2a  Tasks of the CSIRT shall include at least the following:  1. Monitoring incidents at a national level,  2. Providing early warning, alerts, announcements  and dissemination of information to relevant  stakeholders about risks and incidents,  3. Responding to incidents,  4. Providing dynamic risk and incident analysis and  situational awareness,  5. Participating in the CSIRT network  1. Monitoring is a generic term, and designated  CSIRTs will need to translate it to their own  context. ENISA plans to make monitoring the  topic of its Workshop for national and  governmental CSIRTs in May 2016.  2. This task amounts to providing the “Alerts and  Warnings” and “Announcements” services.  More information as to how a CSIRT can deliver  these services can be found in ENISA’s guides on  (Set up; Alerts-Warnings-Announcements?)  3. This is a basic requirement for CSIRTs. If  necessary, ENISA’s Incident Management Guide  can be of help.  https://www.bestpractical.com/rtir/ https://github.com/certsocietegenerale/FIR/blob/master/README.md https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/support/incident-management  NIS Directive and national CSIRTs  TLP WHITE  |  Info Note  |  Final  |  February 2016  © European Union Agency for Network and Information Security (ENISA), 2016  06  PARAGRAPH STATEMENT MEANING  4. Concrete definitions are up to discussion within  the CSIRT network. ENISA will support these  discussions by making appropriate proposals.  5. Participation, both online and in physical  meetings, is essential to build trust between the  members of the group.  2b  The CSIRT shall establish cooperative relationships with  private sector.  Collaboration with the private sector is required to handle  incidents efficiently. Designated CSIRTs will need to cover  at least the sectors specified in Annex II of the Directive,  however the group members will have to decide what  information they want to share with the private sector.  ENISA will support the group by making appropriate  proposals.  2c  To facilitate cooperation, the CSIRT shall promote the  adoption and use of common or standardised practises  for:  1. incident and risk handling procedures,  2. incident, risk and information classification  schemes.  More concrete definitions are up to discussion within the  CSIRT network. ENISA will support these discussions by  making appropriate proposals.  6 Conclusion  The advent of the NIS Directive is a significant event in the EU, because it is the first time NIS is tackled at  such a high level.  For designated CSIRTs, the Directive gives many arguments that will help them formalise their mandate as  well as secure budget, resources, and infrastructure.  The tasks given to the CSIRT network are varied, and it will be up to group members to define their own  rules and good practices. The group can help build further trust within CSIRTs in the EU, provided its  members take an active part.  ENISA will provide active support to the group, as Secretary, but also in helping teams come to meetings,  and by providing input for discussions and moderating debates if necessary.  About “Info Notes” from ENISA  With the “Info Notes” series ENISA aims at giving the interested reader some background and  recommendations about NIS related topics. The background and recommendations are derived from past  experiences and common sense, and should be taken as starting points for discussions on possible course  of action by relevant stakeholders. Feel free to get in touch with ENISA to discuss or inquire more  information on the “Info Notes” series (cert-relations@enisa.europa.eu).",

The selection of this segment for this year’s cybersecurity market analysis  is the result of a poll carried out with the involvement of multiple stakeholders, both outside and  within ENISA. The criteria used for the prioritisation of the collected proposals were the size of  the relevant market, the importance and criticality of the market for businesses of all sizes,  relevance of the sector to EU policy, relevance to research and relevance to regulatory  activities.  For this analysis, ENISA has performed primary research, that is, a survey involving the main  stakeholder types of the cloud computing ecosystem by means of dedicated questionnaires.  The quantitative information from the survey has been validated via qualitative information  obtained through open-source information, as well as by means of quality assurance by various  external experts, including the members of the ENISA Ad Hoc Working Group on Cybersecurity  Market Analysis.  By collecting information from various stakeholder types of the cloud ecosystem, we were in the  position to assess stakeholder-specific perspectives on cloud cybersecurity. Differences among  stakeholder perspectives are key to understand differences in viewpoints, requirements,  capability levels, perceptions about threats and challenges, compliance, etc. These variating  views are – in many cases – indicative of potential market trends, market barriers, market and  research gaps, skill shortages, the existence of market niches, etc. The conclusions of this  report capture many of these topics, in particular the following ones.  • Market characteristics and market trends. A variety of cybersecurity market  characteristics and market trends are presented, including manageability of offered  cybersecurity functions, technical integration options for various cybersecurity functions,  the role of data privacy, consolidation of on-premises and off-premises security (see  Section 8.1).  • Market barriers. Factors leading to difficulties in the market adoption of cloud computing  services have been identified, in particular variating perceptions about the level of threat  management by various cybersecurity functions, lack of cybersecurity skills in most of the  stakeholders of the cloud ecosystem, the reduced level of adoption of cybersecurity- related certifications, low availability of standards and intellectual property rights (IPRs), as  well as distortions in the flow of vulnerability and incident information among the cloud  stakeholders (see Section 8.3).  • Market gaps. Various gaps in the cloud cybersecurity market emerge through mismatches  in deployment of cybersecurity functions between the demand side and supply side. The  market gaps are rooted in concerns about the management of various threats and unclear  distributions responsibilities about the implementation and maintenance of cloud  cybersecurity functions (see Section 8.2).  • Research and innovation. Some clear indications about the importance of zero-trust  architectures, the use of privacy enhancing technologies and the impact of cloud  technology in artificial intelligence, 5G and quantum computing make these topics  excellent candidates for research and deployment actions (see Section 8.4).

A number of reflections regarding the future paths for the  development of the supply of cloud cybersecurity services have been formulated. These  are mainly attempts to properly orchestrate cybersecurity services, where different  approaches will be implemented, depending on the nature of cloud suppliers (for example  hyperscalers and cloud enablers) (see Section 8.5).  Besides the analyses and conclusions presented in this document, there is some additional  material in this work that may be interesting for a number of stakeholders. This includes  collected raw data, developed questionnaires, details of the various stakeholder perceptions,  scoping information, as well as the tools and processes used. ENISA is open to share any kind  of information resulting from this cybersecurity market analysis with interested stakeholders.  CLOUD CYBERSECURITY MARKET ANALYSIS  Final | 1.0 | Public | March 2023  7  1. INTRODUCTION  The present report on cloud cybersecurity market analysis is the result of an activity planned in  the European Union Agency for Cybersecurity (ENISA)’s Work Programme 2022 (3), under  activity O.7.1.: ‘Market analysis on the main trends in the cybersecurity market on both the  demand side and the supply side’. Elaborations on the market uptake of cybersecurity products,  services and processes contribute toward the ENISA strategic objective of ‘A high level of trust  in secure digital solutions’.  Market analysis at ENISA is performed on an annual basis, delivering each year an analysis of  a market sector that has been selected by several of ENISA’s stakeholders. For 2022, the area  of cloud cybersecurity market analysis has been selected. Various factors have contributed to  this selection, namely: the activities in the area of cybersecurity certification through the  European Union Cybersecurity Certification Scheme for Cloud Services (EUCS), the emergence  of various technological factors that will influence this important market segment (e.g. artificial  intelligence (AI), 5G), the wish to foster EU innovation based on research results in this area,  ongoing/emerging regulatory actions both at EU and Member-State level. With this work, ENISA  seeks to provide market intelligence in this domain, in order to facilitate all these activities.  With this objective in mind, primary research has been performed on the basis of a survey that  was developed and conducted by ENISA with the support of the ENISA Ad Hoc Working Group  on Cybersecurity Market Analysis (4) and some external experts. The entire work has been  conducted via processes and activities as described in the ENISA Cybersecurity Market  Analysis Framework (ECSMAF). What is more, this year’s work has served as a thorough test  of ECSMAF; the experience gained has been fed back to the ENISA framework and has led to  an updated version of ECSMAF V.2 (5).  This report is the outcome of this ENISA analysis. It contains the most important findings from  the survey, which are oriented towards the various target groups of this report, these being the  following.  • EU institutions, bodies and agencies. Market analyses are important to help  policymakers understand trends and related supply and demand issues.  • National public authorities, in particular bodies involved in regulation. Market  surveillance is the main instrument for efficient regulatory policies.  • ENISA stakeholder groups (e.g. the European Cybersecurity Certification Group,  Stakeholder Cybersecurity Certification Group, and ENISA Advisory Group). Market  intelligence may support decision-making for prioritising various cybersecurity efforts and  spotting market gaps.  • Industry and cross-sectoral associations. Market analyses allow them to analyse  market opportunities, trends, challenges and vulnerabilities and allow for the creation of  competitive advantages for EU industry players.  • Consumer organisations and associations. Market analyses allow them to comprehend  the needs and requirements of consumers for cybersecurity products, services and  processes, and their prospects in the European cybersecurity market.

They can use the proposed  methodology to assess the maturity of existing products and markets and guide the  development of new technologies and services.  As a final note, one should underline that this activity has value that goes beyond the content of  this report, which lies mainly in the fact that an entire market analysis life-cycle process was  performed. Numerous other side products of this life cycle may also be useful to a variety of  stakeholders: scoping information, generated questionnaires, threat assessments, raw data  collected, etc. This material bears a high potential for reuse, re-scoping and adaptation to other  purposes, among other things. Last but not least, by performing a complete market analysis life  cycle, ENISA is in the position to transfer this knowledge to interested parties and/or elaborate  on integration and use-cases with relevant cybersecurity disciplines, thereby creating a win-win  situation.  1.1.  SCOPING OF THE CLOUD CYBERSECURITY ANALYSIS  Performed in accordance with the ECSMAF (5), the present analysis of the cloud cybersecurity  market has been initiated through a scoping activity. The objective of scoping is manifold.  • To agree on the depth and breadth of the analysis, by focusing on the relevant  cybersecurity market elements according to their importance (i.e. role for the supplier, role  for the demand side, level of exposure to threats). The agreement for the current analysis  included the members of the ENISA Ad Hoc Working Group on Cybersecurity Market  Analysis, stakeholders of ENISA (ENISA Advisory Group and National Liaison Officers  Network), as well as ENISA internal groups.  • To make sure that the analysis effort can be performed with the available resources  (human and monetary) within the available time.  • To identify the data collection method (primary, secondary).  • To identify the groups participating in the validation of the intermediate and final results of  the analysis.  As proposed in the ECSMAF, the focus of the current cybersecurity market analysis has been  set in such a way as to cover the important concerns and perceptions of the various  stakeholders of the cloud computing ecosystem:  • the demand side, which includes the end users of cloud services;  • the supply side, which includes cloud service providers (CSPs) and cloud enablers;  • organisations conducting R & D in cloud computing;  • bodies involved in regulation, covering regulatory activities in could computing.  Detailed descriptions and profiles of these stakeholders can be found in Section 2.1.1.  The focus of the present cloud cybersecurity market analysis is summarised in Table 1. The  detailed scoping of the analysis can be found in Annex B.

The consequences of the above scoping decision for the  collected and analysed information are discussed below.  Focus, content and structure of the collected market information  The current analysis aims at highlighting the cybersecurity-related properties of cloud  offerings. Moreover, it embraces the perceptions of the stakeholders of the cloud ecosystem, by  analysing their cybersecurity and business requirements, their needs and the impact of service  deployment towards reduced exposure to cyberthreats. The following elements are taking into  consideration in the market analysis:  • Collection of stakeholder perspectives on equal or similar issues. By asking  questions about various cybersecurity-related matters of cloud services to a variety of  stakeholder types, their viewpoints can be compared and various interesting points can  be identified (i.e. similarities and gaps in perception, differentiated requirements,  various views of relevant threats, etc.). Most of the sections of this analysis present  such views in a comparative manner.  • Emphasis on the cybersecurity details of the offerings. Instead of looking at  generic market figures, the cybersecurity analysis conducted concentrates on the  cybersecurity-related properties of the service. This creates a specific angle of analysis  that is merely based on the conception and consumption of the cybersecurity  characteristics of the service.  • Emphasis on cybersecurity threats and challenges. A basic element in the  conducted analysis is the ability of a service to reduce exposure to cyberthreats and to  help master cybersecurity challenges. By taking into account data on cyberthreat  exposure and cybersecurity challenges for cloud services, we generate a multi- stakeholder perception of the central cybersecurity properties of the analysed service.  • Assessment of necessary capabilities, market drivers and barriers. A number of  important market success parameters are also taken into account. Adequate demand- side capabilities to efficiently deploy the service is an important adoption criterion.  Similarly, market divers (and its antipode, market barriers) are decisive factors towards  achieving market vitalisation and the successful launch of a product/service.  CLOUD CYBERSECURITY MARKET ANALYSIS  Final | 1.0 | Public | March 2023  11  Market information that is outside the focus of the analysis  Given the selected scope of the cloud cybersecurity analysis, we have neither collected  economic/financial figures regarding supply and demand in cloud computing nor assessed any  of the long-term financial figures and statistics of the relevant market. This is particularly the  case for financial data on supplier and end-user market activities and market development  statistics; such data include past, present and forthcoming market-value information on  suppliers and end users. The collection of such economic figures is a long-term activity,  requiring qualitative, long-term data collection. Such activities go beyond our scope, resource  availability and planning horizon. There are certainly other activities/organisations that are better  suited to perform such long-term tasks, both outside (6) (7) and within ENISA (8).  1.2.  INFORMATION ON PERFORMED DATA COLLECTION  Through ENISA stakeholder consultations and past experience with market analysis, it has  been decided to perform primary research for the cloud cybersecurity market analysis. For this  purpose, a survey has been generated, supported by the ENISA Ad Hoc Working Group on  Cybersecurity Market Analysis and external experts. The survey was divided in questions  targeting the various stakeholders of the cloud ecosystem. The survey consisted of around 100  in questions total, for all cloud stakeholder types (i.e. supply, demand, R & D and bodies  involved in regulation). As survey tool, the EUSurvey (9) platform has been used. The survey is  anonymous. No data about the responders has been collected, therefore tracing back the  responders is impossible.  Through an ENISA announcement, 230 stakeholders interested in participating in the survey  have been identified (pre-registered). Among those, there were also associations of cloud  suppliers and cloud users, but also cloud computing consortia. While the pre-registered  individuals came from all over the world, the majority were located or active in the EU. Around  60 responses were submitted via the online survey.  Table 2 provides an overview of the data collection process.

This included mainly data sanity checks, such as plausibility and data consistency checks. The  data set that went into the analysis is considered as a whole to be representative thanks to:  - a good mix of large and smaller organisations, both on the supply and demand sides;  - good coverage of EU Member States;  - good coverage of R & D organisations conducting cloud-related research; and  - good coverage of EU regulatory bodies engaging in cloud regulation.  The quantitative data obtained through the survey have been validated by means of additional  qualitative data obtained through desktop research: the analysed results and conclusions made  were compared with findings from publicly available information to examine in more depth their  validity. As an additional validation step, the analysis and the final conclusion was reviewed by  various subject-matter experts, such as contracted external experts and members of the ENISA  Ad Hoc Working Group on Cybersecurity Market Analysis.  All in all, the survey had a positive outcome for ENISA, in particular to gain further experience in  terms of scoping and structuring a cyber security market survey, market stakeholder  mobilisation and data sanity and data validation.  The second deliverable in 2 years’ time, this analysis helped ENISA to increase its maturity level  in the performance of cybersecurity market analysis tasks, with the advantage of being in the  position to transfer collected knowledge to external and internal ENISA stakeholders alike.  1.3.  STRUCTURE OF THIS REPORT  The report has been structured so as to contain the highlights of the performed cloud  cybersecurity market analysis. Its sections contain the most important findings from the  performed survey and comprise a synthetic view based on the collected evidence. With the  presented material, we seek to cover the information needs of the main target group of the  report, this being all stakeholder types of the cloud ecosystem (see also Section 2.1.1), thus  covering the information needs of supply, demand, regulatory bodies and R & D organisations.  It is assumed that with this information at hand, the needs of Member States, the European  Commission and EU institutions, bodies and agencies will also be covered, as they will be in the  position to satisfy their information needs by taking into account the presented results in all  kinds of oversight, guidance and regulatory activities. Should some of these external  stakeholders wish to have access to the anonymous raw data collected, they can contact  ENISA to submit their request (see contact information at the beginning of this report).  Moreover, the generated results will be of value to ENISA’s internal stakeholders. For example,  various ENISA activities in the areas of certification, cybersecurity index, research and  innovation, cybersecurity investments, cyberthreat analysis, vulnerability management, etc.,  may use both these results, but also raw data of the performed survey for their own purposes.  It is worth mentioning that the structure of this report has already been validated by ENISA  stakeholders, such as the ENISA Advisory Group and the National Liaison Officers Network,  and ENISA-internal groups working in areas overlapping with the contents addressed in this  analysis.  The structure of this report is as follows.

CLOUD CYBERSECURITY MARKET ANALYSIS  Final | 1.0 | Public | March 2023  14  2. CHARACTERISTICS OF THE  CLOUD CYBERSECURITY  ECOSYSTEM  When analysing the cloud computing cybersecurity market, it is necessary to envisage/assess  various building blocks of cloud computing, such as infrastructure components, models,  activities, characteristics, capabilities and service architecture. These cloud computing  elements (10) will be impacted by any materialised threat, deliberate or accidental, causing  potential damage to hosted data and services.  In this section, we present all relevant elements of cloud computing that are considered as the  main assets of cloud computing infrastructure. Existing standards regarding the cloud  computing infrastructure components, cloud models and service provisioning have been  considered for this discussion (11). Moreover, numerous publications do exist, consolidating  cybersecurity issues in cloud computing environments. Based on this material, a summary of  various cloud computing assets is provided in the discussion below. Related threat-assessment  reports/documents indicate methods on how they can be targeted and which cybersecurity  issues have been encountered.  In the context of a cybersecurity market analysis, the role of the presented material is to set the  scene for the relationship between cybersecurity and cloud computing.  Companies in cybersecurity market segments, for example, relate to cloud computing in several  ways, such as by providing security from the cloud (the ‘security as a service’ (SECaaS)  business model), providing security for the cloud computing infrastructure (e.g. secure stack  components) or providing security in the cloud (e.g. confidentiality of data in the cloud).  Similarly, companies from the cloud computing market segment, which could be hyperscalers  offering public cloud services, independent software vendors or even other enablers (managed  cloud, brokers etc.), increasingly offer various cybersecurity security products and services as  well.  This makes market segmentation and value-chain issues in cloud computing security highly  dynamic and volatile, with convergence and interference of cybersecurity and cloud computing  elements being an important part of the context for this report.  With this material in mind, survey questions were formulated to cover both demand and supply  perceptions on:  - the overall structure of cloud computing infrastructure, related ecosystem and elements,  including service provisioning and relevant cloud computing stakeholders;  - available cloud and cybersecurity services,  - common cloud computing and service threats;  - cybersecurity challenges in the cloud computing ecosystem; and  (10)  The word ‘elements’ is used as a synonym of ‘cloud computing building blocks’. Moreover, assets are  considered cloud elements that are critical for the user of the service and/or for the operator of the cloud  computing infrastructure, thus being valuable for the end-to-end service provisioning and/or for the  business process they implement.  (11)  E.g. https://www.iso.org/committee/601355.html#, accessed April 2022.  https://www.iso.org/committee/601355.html  CLOUD CYBERSECURITY MARKET ANALYSIS  Final | 1.0 | Public | March 2023  15  - cybersecurity controls, technologies and solutions, deployed to deal with threats and  challenges in cloud computing.  It must also be noted that most of the collected material reflect the status of cloud computing as  it has evolved in the last years, but it is limited in that it has to present a rather a static view on  cloud computing.  The development and adoption of emerging technologies, such as the Internet of Things (IoT),  5G and AI, but also the pace of digital transformation, has contributed to an even faster  evolution and adoption of cloud computing technology. Edge computing (12) / fog computing (13)  and cloud continuum (14), are examples of the transformation of cloud computing. Within this  analysis, the dynamic part is captured by means of an assessment of cloud innovation trends.  The analysis targets ecosystem perspectives through a number of stakeholder views (see also  Section 2.1.1). On the demand side, these are mainly stakeholders who already have (or wish  to establish) a contractual relationship with a CSP and use cloud security products or services,  either from the same CSP or from another supply-side stakeholder (cloud enabler, independent  software vendor, etc.). Regarding the supply side, these are either stakeholders directly  providing cloud computing and cloud security services or enablers adding some value to the  cloud service provided by the CSP (i.e. cybersecurity product or services, managed detection  and response, consulting, etc.).  2.1.  CLOUD ECOSYSTEM  The cloud ecosystem is understood as mix of technology, operational and organisational  entities that make up the entire service provisioning chain and cover both supply and demand.  The cloud ecosystem consists of different cloud service categories, cloud deployment models,  cloud capability types and cybersecurity-related services, functions and capabilities. Roles and  relationships between stakeholders on the supply and demand sides are the most important  part to define an ecosystem, together with specific resources, requirements and issues for  certain organisations or users. While cloud computing roles and associated activities and  responsibilities are standardised (15) (16), the relationship with cybersecurity might not clearly  taken into account in these definitions. To give an example, a managed cybersecurity service  operator (e.g. managed detection and response) might need access to cloud computing  network traffic or log files on behalf of its client, but it might not be considered as a ‘cloud  service partner’ as defined by ISO (17).  In this section, the various cloud ecosystem elements that are important for this analysis are  briefly presented. They make up the basis of this analysis and were an integral part of the  survey.  As regards the cloud infrastructure, four infrastructure levels are considered. The cloud  infrastructure levels are related to cybersecurity, both within cybersecurity products and services  (see Section 2.3) and by means of threats targeting those infrastructure levels (see Section  2.5). These levels are:  • the data level, representing the data household of cloud computing, with both stored data  and data in transit;  • the application level, representing installed applications using the cloud computing  resources (hardware and software);  (12)  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edge_computing, accessed May 2022.  (13)  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fog_computing, accessed May 2022.  (14)  https://www.veritis.com/blog/what-is-cloud-continuum-and-how-businesses-can-leverage-it/, accessed  May 2022.

Cloud Computing Stakeholder Types  While multiple stakeholders may be part of the cloud computing ecosystem, for the sake of this  market analysis, we will only consider the main stakeholder types described below (see Table  3). It is worth mentioning that organisations may play multiple roles in the cloud ecosystems. For  example, a research institution can concurrently act as a cloud user, an enabler can consume  cloud services for its own need, and a regulator can subscribe to a cloud service.  The roles presented below are the main ones mentioned in various publications on cloud  computing. Nonetheless, they present a rather static view, as opposed to the dynamic nature of  the cloud ecosystem, where various other roles may emerge and existing ones may overlap or  evolve. The choice of this rather static approach is due to the purpose of grouping questions of  this survey accordingly.  In the survey underlying this analysis, stakeholders invited to participate in the survey may refer  to the various roles they may hold in the cloud ecosystem. For each role, they will be asked to  answer the corresponding survey questions dedicated to that role. In this way, we aim at  covering the maximum scope of their activities in the cloud ecosystem.  Table 3: Main cloud stakeholder types considered for the purpose of the present market  analysis  Stakeholder  type Description Examples  Supply side:  CSPs  Owners and operators of cloud computing systems  offering public, private, hybrid and community  cloud services. They are responsible for end-to- end service provisioning, including maintenance,  protection and infrastructure upgrades. They may  include various service providers in their service  provisioning supply chain.  Microsoft, Google, Amazon  (all models: software as a  service (SaaS), platform as  a service (PaaS) and  infrastructure as a service  (IaaS), Oracle, SAP,  Salesforce (for SaaS,  PaaS).  Supply side:  enablers  Enablers are intermediates between end users  and public-service platform providers and/or  private cloud computing. They facilitate the  adoption of cloud services by, for example:  • packaging services;  • providing added-value services on top of  services offered by service platform providers;  • operating the private cloud for customers;  • providing multi-cloud solutions.  Enabler examples include cloud brokers,  integrators, consultants, developers, outsourcers,  application hosting, etc. Their offerings add value  to CSPs (see above) and/or operators/managers  of private cloud platforms.  ATOS, Cap Gemini,  Accenture, Deloitte, PwC,  KPMG etc.  CLOUD CYBERSECURITY MARKET ANALYSIS  Final | 1.0 | Public | March 2023  17  Stakeholder  type Description Examples  Demand side:  end users,  consumers  Both current and prospective subscribers of cloud  computing services, at all levels of their business  processes (including infrastructure providers  integrating cloud services within their  infrastructure, e.g. 5G operators, financial  institutions, IoT service providers, etc.).  All kinds of subscribers –  both private and  commercial – irrespectively  of size and business  needs.  Entities  involved in  regulatory work  National or international entities / public authorities  / institutions that – directly or indirectly – exert  regulatory influence on cloud services.  European Commission,  regulators of Member  States, data protection  authorities, associations,  etc.  R & D Public and private organisations performing  research on cloud technology, cloud services,  cloud operations, cloud functions, usage models,  etc.  Universities, research  institutions.  Note: Throughout this cloud cybersecurity market analysis, we have not discriminated between  cloud service providers and enablers. Instead, we have merged these two types under the  stakeholder type ‘supply side’. Although this differentiation would be significant to capture the  market role of these two stakeholder types, there is still a certain ‘blurriness’ in the market  regarding these types. In many cases, cybersecurity services are integrated in typical CSP  offerings. On the other hand, enablers often act as resellers of typical cloud services, while  providing value-added cybersecurity services. This fact introduces a certain ‘blurriness’ in the  market. Besides this, the merge was also done in order to simplify the dissemination to  organisations that are active in supplying cloud services and in order to avoid confusion on the  part of the participating organisations.  2.2.  CLOUD MODELS AND ATTRIBUTES  As defined in relevant standards (18), the cloud paradigm consists of five essential attributes,  three service delivery models and four deployment models. Their relationship with cybersecurity  is documented in different standards (19) (20) and other reports. Understanding the ecosystem  and division of responsibility is essential in order to understand the market context, with so  many vendors, platforms, tools and services that fall under the IaaS, PaaS and SaaS  categories, sometimes overlapping, as well as the fast evolution of deployment models. While  responsibility used to be more statically assigned in the past, these days it is more appropriate  to talk about the sliding scale of security responsibilities in the cloud. Figure 1 provides an  overview of this.  (18)  https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3417/11/19/9005/pdf, accessed April 2022.  (19)  https://www.iso.org/standard/67545.html, accessed November 2022.  (20)  https://www.iso.org/standard/43757.html, accessed November 2022.  https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3417/11/19/9005/pdf https://www.iso.org/standard/67545.html https://www.iso.org/standard/43757.html  CLOUD CYBERSECURITY MARKET ANALYSIS  Final | 1.0 | Public | March 2023  18  Figure 1: Cloud computing attributes and models  The contents of the cloud computing models and attributes are described in the following  sections.  2.2.1.  Service Models  The service models consist three main use-cases of cloud infrastructures. Depending on the  service model used, the responsibilities for the operation and maintenance of the corresponding  computing layers/functions are attributed either to the service provider or the end user. The  following computing functions are considered: application, data, runtime, middleware, operating  system, virtualisation and hardware.  • ‘Software as a service’ (SaaS) model. The user of the service can access applications  hosted by a service provider on a network. Users of this service can directly use the desired  application. I many cases, this model is associated with a pay-as-you-go policy, and easy  access to the application via a browser is often implemented. In this service model, the  provider is responsible for maintaining all hosted computing functions: applications, data,  runtime, middleware, operating system, virtualisation and hardware. In this model, the  provider is responsible for the cybersecurity of the entire service, covering the entire set of  hosted components.  • ‘Platform as a service’ (PaaS) model. While the user of an application is responsible for  its installation, maintenance and data management, the provider delivers all other  computing functions, such as runtime, middleware, operating system, virtualisation and  hardware. PaaS often delivers software-development tools and various programming  languages, allowing users to develop their own software.  • ‘Infrastructure as a service’ (IaaS) model. In this model, the service provider delivers  resources to the user hardware as a single tenant, often on the basis of a pay-per-use  policy. This allows users of the service to minimise high initial hardware investments.  CLOUD CYBERSECURITY MARKET ANALYSIS  Final | 1.0 | Public | March 2023  19  Moreover, service providers are in the position to respond to changing performance  requirements in a quick and cost-effective manner.  2.2.2.  Deployment Models  Deployment models are the initial choice of cloud users regarding the desired model for sharing,  access and ownership of the available computing resources. Deployment models determine the  number and nature of tenants using a shared cloud computing resource. Deployment models  include the public cloud, private cloud, community cloud and hybrid cloud.  • Public cloud. This deployment model – often referred to as an external cloud – is open to  a large number of users who can access it via the internet. The access to the cloud  resources is managed by the CSP, who also carries the responsibility of maintaining the  operation of the service, according to the selected service model.  • Private cloud. This deployment model is dedicated to the use of the available cloud  computing resources by a single tenant (i.e. by a user, group or institution). This  deployment model is a more secure but more expensive option. It can be operated either  by the CSP or by any other third party, both on-site and off-site.  • Community cloud. This deployment model is dedicated to groups of users/communities  that share the same type of requirements (i.e. security, privacy, compliance, policies, etc.).  It can be managed by members of the community or any other third party, including the  CSP.  • Hybrid cloud. This deployment model represents a mix of two or more of the above  deployment models. By mixing these deployment models, users might aim at having a  more restrictive policy for parts of their infrastructure (e.g. data management), while other  parts (e.g. applications) may be used by means of a shared model.  • Multi-cloud. Multi-cloud is a cloud environment that integrates various deployment models  (just as the hybrid cloud does). The difference with the hybrid cloud is that a mixed cloud  also integrates various instances of the same deployment model types into a single logical  cloud infrastructure. Issues of compatibility of data and applications are essential in this  regard.  Although multi-cloud is considered as a distinct deployment model (21) (22), within this analysis it  is not considered as an additional option, as it is considered to be covered by the  abovementioned ‘hybrid cloud’ option.  2.2.3.  Cloud Essential Attributes  Cloud essential attributes represent the means for provisioning the various cloud computing  models mentioned above, with the aim to offer users differentiated pricing methods. These  attributes apply to each of the above models and provide various means of flexibility for the  pricing options of the used services.  • On-demand self-service (pay-as-you-use). The user will be in the position to pay per  usage, thus reducing costs according to their needs. This pricing model is imposed  automatically by the service provider, without any human intervention.  • Broad network access. Available cloud services can be offered via the network through  (thick) client platforms and through a number of devices, such as laptops, workstations and  mobile devices.  • Resource pooling (multi-tenant). Multiple users participating in a multi-tenant model can  use pooled resources – both physical and virtual – according to their demand.  • Rapid elasticity. Available cloud resources can be released in a rapid manner, scaled  according to user requests/requirements. Requested resources can be allocated at any  time and in any quantity.

Cloud services can automatically control resource utilisation by  automatically measuring the level of usage (e.g. number of users, amount of processing,  network bandwidth). This is done for optimisation purposes and also increases  transparency of usage for both users and providers.  2.3.  CYBERSECURITY PRODUCTS AND SERVICES RELATED TO CLOUD  COMPUTING  Consolidating the information on the cloud computing ecosystem, models and attributes  mentioned so far, but also that on other existing information on cloud based service offerings,  this section provides a non-exhaustive list of products and services developed to cover  cybersecurity requirements and the needs of both supply and demand – from the cloud, in the  cloud and for the cloud. This information is presented in a tabular form, breaking down the  various cybersecurity services and functions (considered as value-added services on top of  those cybersecurity features and services already available or provided by CSPs), in a similar  manner as the ECSMAF (23) (see Table 4).

CLOUD COMPUTING CYBERSECURITY CHALLENGES  In this section, some security challenges are presented. They constitute a list of cybersecurity  concerns that are relevant for the majority of cloud computing stakeholder types (i.e. supply,  demand and regulatory bodies). Though not completely overlap-free, these challenges are  indicative of the necessity to protect cloud resources on the basis of the assumption that cloud  computing is – now and within the foreseeable future – a growing industry and a central facility  for the processing of company data. Cybersecurity challenges will be used within the present  analysis to capture the concerns of demand, supply and regulatory bodies. The cybersecurity  challenges summarised below (in alphabetical order) have been found in various publications  related to cybersecurity in cloud computing (24) (25).  • Access control. Access-control challenges emerge through the difficulty of implementing  a distributed access-control architecture embracing all distributed access of the –  eventually distributed – organisation. The need for asynchronous interactions in a  decentralised, distributed environment may pose additional challenges to the technical  implementation of a coherent access-control policy.  • Audit. Such challenges emerge from the complexity of audit actions aiming to regularly  monitor performance and compliance within end-to-end cloud service delivery.  • Authorisation. These challenges emerge through errors/misconfigurations in tools for  authorisation management and for accessibility of cloud computing resources (i.e.  applications, data and network).  • Availability. Availability challenges emerge for users and service providers alike. Users  need to develop proper strategies (26) by properly configuring available cloud resources to  obtain application and data availability. On the other hand, availability offered by CSPs has  been traditionally limited to local installations of hardware and software resources. With the  inclusion of multiple players in the cloud computing infrastructures and supply chain, the  achievement of an overall end-to-end availability of services requires large orchestration  across a number of organisations and infrastructures.  • Chain of trust / chain of responsibility. These are challenges related to the  maintenance of coherent account control and accountability control throughout an  organisation (i.e. multi-cloud and local processing) in accordance with enterprise policies.  • Compliance. These challenges are related to the compliance of cloud services regarding  international, national and sectorial requirements, especially regarding the confidentiality  and privacy of processed information, but also the governance of services. Depending on  geographies of business activities, for a single organisation, multiple compliance  requirements may be applicable. This adds an additional level of complexity in mastering  compliance challenges.  • Confidentiality. Confidentiality challenges emerge in the cloud mainly at the data and  network levels. At the data level, confidentiality challenges are related to the disclosure of  user data to unauthorised entities, which is mainly an effect of misconfiguration,  malfunctioning or discoordination of access rights. At the network level, confidentiality  breaches occur when network content is captured by attackers, particularly in multi-tenant  environments.  • Cybersecurity incident management. These challenges are related to the ability to  recognise, analyse and respond to incidents related to various valuable assets offered to  users via a cloud service (i.e. applications, data and cloud infrastructure elements).  • Identification and authentication. Identification and authentication challenges may  emerge through difficulties in the coordination of identity managements in both cloud and  internal systems. The introduction of the necessary cloud credentials and their  (24)  https://www.sans.org/white-papers/40225/, accessed May 2022.  (25)  https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8485370/, accessed May 2022.  (26)  https://www.techtarget.com/searchcloudcomputing/feature/3-best-practices-to-achieve-high-  availability-in-cloud-computing, accessed May 2022.  https://www.sans.org/white-papers/40225/ https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8485370/ https://www.techtarget.com/searchcloudcomputing/feature/3-best-practices-to-achieve-high-availability-in-cloud-computing https://www.techtarget.com/searchcloudcomputing/feature/3-best-practices-to-achieve-high-availability-in-cloud-computing  CLOUD CYBERSECURITY MARKET ANALYSIS  Final | 1.0 | Public | March 2023  23  management needs to be coherent with the identity management policies applied in the  internal IT (see also threat 4 in Section 2.5).  • Integrity. Integrity challenges in the cloud environment may emerge regarding data,  network and insecure application programming interfaces (APIs). Data integrity challenges  exist due to data storage in multiple locations. Network integrity challenges are due to the  reuse of IP addresses and the corruption of routing information, both leading to information  leakages. At the level of insecure APIs, integrity challenges emerge through violations of  access control and authentication, leading to loss of data.  • Multi-tenancy. These challenges emerge from multi-tenancy, especially regarding data  loss, loss of confidentiality and availability. Such challenges may arise when virtual  machines / hypervisors are successfully attacked and the adversary gets access to all  available tenants.  • Network security. Challenges in network security emerge through the complexity of  network connections to be managed in a distributed virtualised environment. In contrast to  traditional networks where the entry and exit points are fixed, in cloud a number of  dynamically configured network access points need to be managed (e.g. network traffic  analysis). Managing the network in a virtualised environment is a far more complex,  leaving space for misconfigurations that offer attack surface.  • Privacy. Privacy challenges emerge from the necessity to impose an organisation-wide  privacy policy in a highly distributed, decentralised and virtualised environment. Diversity  of privacy regulations in various geographies adds an additional level of difficulty to master  privacy challenges.  • Storage. These challenges are related to secure storage, compatibility of data among  various platforms, potential data losses, assurance of physical location of stored data in  virtual environments (i.e. within the various deployment models).  • Transparency/visibility/nonrepudiation. These are challenges stemming from the  absence of visibility and transparency in the use of cloud services (applications, data,  APIs, etc. – see also threats 10 and 11 in Section 2.5).  2.5.  THREAT EXPOSURE OF CLOUD COMPUTING  Cloud infrastructures and cloud services are exposed to a number of cyberthreats. For the  current analysis, we will consider the threats assessed through Cloud Security Alliance (27) (i.e.  the ‘Egregious Eleven’) (28). These threats represent the exposure of cloud computing  infrastructure levels and functions. Ideally, existing cybersecurity measures will reduce the  attack surface, thus reducing exposure to these threats.  1. Data breaches (29) (30). Through unauthorised access, protected information can be  manipulated, deleted, released or stolen. The reasons of such an incident can be manifold,  including human error, misconfiguration, malicious attack, negligence, etc. Mostly, a data  breach is a consequence of a successful attack from inside or outside the organisation.  2. Abuse of misconfigurations and inadequate change control. Errors in the  configuration of IT components and/or inadequate management of software is a weakness  that can be abused by adversaries. Such weaknesses may be detected by attackers and  can be exploited through attacks to related IT components.  3. Lack of cloud security architecture and strategy. A smooth transition to cloud based  services needs to go hand in hand with a plan for the expansion of the cybersecurity  (27)  https://cloudsecurityalliance.org/artifacts/top-threats-egregious-11-deep-dive, accessed February  2023.  (28)  Some of the egregious eleven are rather weaknesses/vulnerabilities, for example insecure interfaces  and APIs. In order to overcome this, for the sake of this analysis some modifications have been made  in the titles of these threats. These additions are annotated through italics. Moreover, some of the  egregious eleven indicated as ‘security issues’ are rather ‘actions on objectives’ (according to the cyber  kill chain), for example the nefarious use of cloud services.  (29)  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/enisa-threat-landscape-2020-data-breach, accessed April  2022.  (30)  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_breach, accessed May 2022.  https://cloudsecurityalliance.org/artifacts/top-threats-egregious-11-deep-dive https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/enisa-threat-landscape-2020-data-breach https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_breach  CLOUD CYBERSECURITY MARKET ANALYSIS  Final | 1.0 | Public | March 2023  24  perimeter. Uncoordinated/unplanned adoption of cloud services may otherwise create  gaps in cybersecurity protection and thus increase exposure to cyberthreats.  4. Abuse of insufficient identity, credential, access and key management. The  deployment of cloud services brings new IAM challenges. The introduction of the  necessary cloud credentials and their management needs to be coherent with the identity  management policies applied in the internal IT. The coordination of both access  managements (cloud and internal) has to be planned (see previous threat), configured and  managed (see also threat 2). This will reduce exposure to the threat of abuse of (weak)  cloud identification and access management functions.  5. Account hijacking (31). This threat indicates the effect of threat materialisation leading to  the take-over of an account (e-mail, computer, web, etc.) by an adversary. An account  hijacking is the entry point of a series of abuses and attacks related to confidential user  data and available functions. Examples of attacks following an account hijacking are  phishing, fraud, exploitation of available functions and abuse of vulnerabilities.  6. Insider threat (32). An insider threat is an action that may result in an incident, performed  by someone or a group of people affiliated with or working for the potential victim. There  are several patterns associated with threats from the inside. A well-known insider threat  pattern (also known as ‘privilege misuse’) occurs when outsiders collaborate with internal  actors to gain unapproved access to assets. Moreover, insiders may cause harm  unintentionally through carelessness or because of a lack of knowledge.  7. Abuse of insecure interfaces and APIs. Cloud services are offered to consumers via a  series of APIs. Moreover, APIs are used within components of the cloud to enable  functions among all layers of the cloud infrastructure. When adversaries gain access to  these APIs, they can cause significant damage, to both cloud users and CSPs (e.g.  manipulations, eavesdropping, data exfiltration).  8. Abuse of weak control plane. Being the main control tool for data management (e.g.  data storage, data migration, data duplication), the control plane plays an important role in  maintaining data security in the cloud. Given the complexity of configuring cloud services,  especially multi-cloud environments, a control plane that lacks coherence with overall  security policy and IT architecture may introduce cybersecurity weaknesses. When  abused, such weaknesses may lead to massive data losses.  9. Metastructure and applistructure failures. For the managing of cloud services through  customers, a series of interfaces (user interfaces and APIs) are offered by the CSP. These  interfaces offer security and protection functions with the aim to be used by cloud users  (i.e. user applications and user control plane). These interfaces reveal important  information about security and protective measures to users of the service. Failures,  weakness, improper use or misuse of these interfaces may introduce significant risks to  the entire infrastructure.  10. Abuse of limited cloud usage visibility. Organisations may not be in the position to fully  track the use of cloud applications and services, irrespectively of the origin of the user  (internal or external). Due to a potentially low visibility of the use of cloud applications,  attackers may gain malicious access to available application interfaces and unnoticeably  use computing resources, manipulate data and perform data exfiltration.  11. Abuse and nefarious use of cloud services. As a result of a successful attack,  adversaries may be in the position to gain access to cloud resources and use them for  malicious activities requiring significant resources, such as denial-of-service attacks,  cryptomining, brute force attacks and massive phishing attacks. Moreover, cloud  resources may be used to hide/store malicious content such as malware and stolen data.  (31)  https://www.techopedia.com/definition/24632/account-hijacking, accessed May 2022.

DEMOGRAPHICS OF  INVOLVED STAKEHOLDER  TYPES  In accordance with the identified cloud stakeholder types, the analysis of the cloud security  market focuses on cloud security users (i.e. demand) and CSPs. The assessment of the cloud  security ecosystem to advance our understanding of the state of play, trends, threats and  opportunities for future secure development requires a complete understanding of all the key  stakeholder types that may influence these elements, including regulatory bodies intervening in  shaping the market and the R & D initiatives on cloud security.  In this chapter, the general characteristics of the surveyed organisations are presented. They  mainly consist of information on sizes, geographies covered by the surveyed organisations and  the sectors of their activities.  3.1. DEMAND SIDE: THE PROFILE OF CLOUD USERS  To analyse the profile of organisations that have adopted cloud systems, the report sorts the  respondents by size (see Figure 2). Large multinational companies (5 000 employees or more)  represent 33 % of the sample, followed by medium-sized enterprises (50 to 249 employees, 27  % of the sample). Large enterprises (250 to 5 000 employees) and micro companies (less than  10 employees) each represents 20 % of the sample, making up 40 % of the sample.  As regards the cloud usage of the demand side, our hypothesis is that smaller organisations will  make more use of SECaaS providers, while large organisations will have more complex  deployment and cloud usage patterns, which in turn will reveal more demand for innovative  cybersecurity products and services from this customer segment.  Figure 2: Size of demand-side organisations (based on number of employees)  As we can see in Figure 3, which depicts the geographical distribution of survey responders,  most of the respondents are located in the Europe, Middle East and Africa region (the EMEA  region), while the remaining 20 % are divided between North and Latin America.  CLOUD CYBERSECURITY MARKET ANALYSIS  Final | 1.0 | Public | March 2023  26  Within the EMEA region, there are no respondents based in Africa. In contrast, several operate  in EU Member States (Figure 3), mainly in Belgium, Germany and the Netherlands, followed by  the Czechia, Ireland, France, Italy, Portugal, Romania, Slovenia, Slovakia, and Sweden.  Figure 3: Geographical distribution of surveyed demand-side organisations  As we can see in Figure 4, , which depicts the engagement of the demand-side in various  sectors, about 40 % of cloud security users are involved in two industries: in banking and  securities and in communications, media and services (33) (each representing 20 % of the  sample). In addition, the government, healthcare, insurance and transportation industries each  represent 7 % of the mapped market. 33 % of user companies operate in other sectors, such as  cybersecurity consulting, technology consulting, ICT, food and beverages, and services  industries.

SUPPLY SIDE: THE PROFILE OF CLOUD PROVIDERS  The cloud-security providers that responded to the survey are mainly multinational companies  (5 000 employees or more, 36 % of the total), followed by medium-sized enterprises (50 to 249  employees, 27 %). Large enterprises (250 to 5 000 employees) and micro companies (less than  ten employees) comprise 18 % of the sample (34). Most of them are located in several  geographical areas besides the EU.  More than 80 % have a physical presence in the EMEA region, 60–80 % are also in the Asia– Pacific region (APAC) or North America, and 20–40 % also have an office in Latin America  (Figure 5). If we focus only on the EU Member States (Figure 5), 60–80 % of interviewed  companies are present in France, while 40–60 % have offices in Germany, Spain, Italy,  Portugal and the Netherlands. Between 20 % and 40 % of companies are in Czechia, Denmark,  Ireland, Greece, Croatia, Hungary the Netherlands, Austria, Poland, Romania, Finland and  Sweden. Less than 20 % also have offices in Bulgaria, Estonia, Cyprus, Slovenia and Slovakia.  Figure 5 shows the geographical distribution of the surveyed cloud suppliers.  (34)  It should be noted that the definitions of company sizes comply with the EU definitions (see https://single-market-  economy.ec.europa.eu/smes/sme-definition_en).  https://single-market-economy.ec.europa.eu/smes/sme-definition_en https://single-market-economy.ec.europa.eu/smes/sme-definition_en  CLOUD CYBERSECURITY MARKET ANALYSIS  Final | 1.0 | Public | March 2023  28  Figure 5: Physical presence of cloud service suppliers  A large percentage (55 %) of the suppliers that responded to the survey only serve EMEA  clients; within the EU Member States, suppliers report serving customers mainly in France,  Belgium (64 %), Germany, Spain, Italy, and Portugal (55 %) (Figure 6). However, 36 % of  suppliers count clients not only in EMEA but also in Latin America, North America and notably  APAC; the remaining 9 % focuses only on the EMEA and APAC markets. The collected data  about the geographical presence of cloud customers in the EU can be found in Figure 6.  CLOUD CYBERSECURITY MARKET ANALYSIS  Final | 1.0 | Public | March 2023  29  Figure 6: Countries of origin of cloud customers of the surveyed cloud suppliers  Their customers operate in the healthcare and banking and securities industries (82 % of  suppliers work for them), followed by utilities, transportation, retail, manufacturing and natural  resources, government and communication, media and services (64 % of suppliers), insurance  (55 %) and education (45 %). Only (27 %) have customers in the wholesale trade sector (see  Figure 7).  CLOUD CYBERSECURITY MARKET ANALYSIS  Final | 1.0 | Public | March 2023  30  Figure 7: Sectors of activity of cloud-supplier customers  3.3.  REGULATORY BODIES  The appreciation of the role regulatory bodies as an important stakeholder type in the cloud  ecosystem is an important element of this analysis. It complements the existing analyses by  assessing the actors’ role and positioning in shaping the context of the cloud security market  and its evolution.  Most of the respondents of this survey (88 % of the sample organisations) take a direct  approach by actively/directly participating in the development, enforcing and promoting of new  regulations in cloud cybersecurity, by paying particular attention to the core sectors of this  market (see Figure 8 and Figure 9).  Figure 8: Role of regulatory bodies in cloud-related regulation  Regulatory activities mainly target the public sector, highly regulated industries and critical  infrastructure-related industries (see Figure 9). The significant majority of regulators focus on  government (targeted by 75 % of the involved organisations); communication, media and  CLOUD CYBERSECURITY MARKET ANALYSIS  Final | 1.0 | Public | March 2023  31  services (62 %); banking and security and utilities (50 %); education, manufacturing and natural  resources; transportation (38 %); insurance and healthcare providers (25 %); and lastly retail  and wholesale trade (12 %).  Figure 9: Sectors targeted by regulatory activities  3.4.  RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ORGANISATIONS  Understanding the focus of investments in R & D is essential to foresee the trajectory of cloud  cybersecurity as R & D may shape the market evolution and its potential opportunities and  threats. The respondents of the survey state that their R & D initiatives mainly focus on the  following sectors: banking and securities; education; government; wholesale trade;  transportation and other sectors, such as technology services, aerospace and military  implications.  A smaller percentage of initiatives (17 %) focuses on utilities, retail, manufacturing and natural  resources; insurance; healthcare providers; and communication, media and services (a sector  including telecommunications).  3.5.  INTERESTING OBSERVATIONS: CLOUD DEMOGRAPHICS  1. Regulated sectors assessed do not comply to most frequent sectors of cloud supply and  demand. Although this may be due to the forward-looking nature of regulation, it might be  interesting to investigate how regulators interact with existing cloud use-cases in various  sectors and how this shapes their regulatory activities.  2. Data about providers’ location and customers’ location may suggest implications for  policymakers – i.e. capacity to interpret privacy/security regulation, etc.  3. It seems as though R & D is not taking care of sectors that use cloud services the most.  This either means that there are limited research needs in those sectors, or that R & D  tends to conduct research on special requirements in a sector-independent manner.  4. Stakeholders that have been involved in this survey are engaged in cloud computing  cybersecurity in several ways, such as: i) providing security from the cloud (SECaaS  business model), ii) providing security for the cloud computing infrastructure e.g. secure  CLOUD CYBERSECURITY MARKET ANALYSIS  Final | 1.0 | Public | March 2023  32  stack components, and iii) providing security in the cloud, for example confidentiality of data  in the cloud. We have a well-balanced split between different types and sizes of demand- side stakeholders (users). Smaller demand-side organisations use SECaaS providers, a  sub-segment of SaaS model, more frequently. Large organisations have more complex  cloud usage patterns, which in turn reveals more demand for innovative cybersecurity  products and services from this customer segments.  5. Many CSPs are also cloud security providers (for example, SECaaS is frequently  considered as a sub-segment of the SaaS market) and a portion of supply-side  stakeholders only provides cybersecurity products and services (see also ‘Supply-side  enablers’ in the definitions of cloud stakeholder types in Section 2.1.1).  CLOUD CYBERSECURITY MARKET ANALYSIS  Final | 1.0 | Public | March 2023  33  4. CLOUD USAGE PATTERNS  AND REQUIREMENTS  4.1.  CLOUD USAGE PATTERNS  The characterisation of cloud adoption and cloud usage depends on the following elements (see  also Section 2.1.1):  • the service model used (IaaS, PaaS, SaaS);  • the deployment model (public cloud, private cloud, multi-cloud, community cloud or  hybrid cloud) indicating the preferred access model of the provided services; and  • the cloud attributes indicating the most appropriate/efficient provisioning model to use  the cloud services.  In terms of the most widely used cloud service model (see Figure 10), according to both the  demand (87 % of sampled companies) and supply (82 %) sides, there is a clear preference for  the SaaS cloud service model. However, interestingly, 67 % of customers also use cloud  through the use the PaaS model, which is offered by only 45 % of providers. These results may  therefore be indicative of a potential market niche, as demand seems to show a preference for  the PaaS cloud service model. We also note that there is a higher concentration of suppliers  (limited supply) in the PaaS cloud service model segment. On the supply side, PaaS is mainly  used by application developers, for which PaaS helps to simplify development and deployment.  It was traditionally also the least important service model in terms of revenue, as not every  organisation has internal developers.  However, PaaS offerings became more widely adopted with the support of micro-service  architectures. Advanced application functionalities, supporting big data, AI, machine-learning  capabilities or the IoT may further drive adoption of PaaS services, and this segment could be  an opportunity for the emerging cloud providers.  Figure 10: Cloud service model, a comparison of perceptions of supply and demand sides  A market imbalance is also clearly visible in terms of deployment models (see Figure 11).  Indeed, even though supply and demand are aligned on the preference for public services  (used by 80 % of customers and offered by 82 % of sellers), the demand for the other services  is much lower than the reported offer, with the highest gap between private cloud demand (40  %) and supply (82 %). This imbalance may suggest that providers are already building capacity  CLOUD CYBERSECURITY MARKET ANALYSIS  Final | 1.0 | Public | March 2023  34  in preparation for a future differentiation in the market or that customers prefer these  deployment models in areas not included in the demand sample (e.g. APAC).  In regards to private cloud services, an adoption of 40 % is in line with the type of demand-side  respondents: private cloud services are usually contracted by larger users, which form about 50  % of the respondents of this study (see Figure 2).  Figure 11: Cloud deployment model, a comparison of perceptions of supply and demand  Results on main cloud attributes confirm a somewhat misaligned situation between demand- reported use and supply offering (Figure 12). Indeed, both parties agree that on-demand self- service (pay-as-you-use) is the most critical characteristic of a successful cloud service.  However, suppliers’ evaluation does not match the relevance that customers given to other  attributes, such as rapid elasticity, broad network access and resource pooling. The opposite is  true regarding measured service and other attributes, such as specialised compliance services.  CLOUD CYBERSECURITY MARKET ANALYSIS  Final | 1.0 | Public | March 2023  35  Figure 12: Cloud attributes, a comparison of perceptions of supply and demand  In the context of cloud security, the relationship and shared responsibility between customer  and CSP is essential. The customer is responsible for securing how they use the cloud services,  including proper configuration. This is another reason why customers contract cloud ‘enablers’  to configure the cloud on their behalf, i.e. by adapting some of the default settings that CSPs  provide. While CSPs provide some tools or mechanisms for self-service (e.g. AWS provides  many related services, such as GuardDuty (35), CloudTrail (36), CloudHSM (37) and CloudWatch  (38)), this makes things more complex. Also, customers might not be able to manage it by  themselves.  This is where the ‘dichotomy of control’ challenge arises: while customers want more control  through self-service and customisation, these can also open new threat vectors.  For example, the on-demand self-service provisioning features enable ‘shadow IT’ (39) (40),  which may lead to the use of cloud services without the consent of an IT department. The result  may be unauthorised use of cloud services, which in turn results in increased risk of malware  infections or data exfiltration/loss.  Another challenge related to on-demand self-service provisioning is APIs, which customers use  to manage and interact with cloud services, and which can contain vulnerabilities.  Resource pooling in another attribute in high demand, where the risks can outweigh the benefits  for the demand side. While the benefits for public cloud providers are clear, security risks for the  supply side include the reuse of resources by different tenant applications, placing services that  belong to different tenants on the same server or automated processes that handle the  allocation and de-allocation of resources at the CSP level. Even in the private cloud, where a  (35)  https://aws.amazon.com/guardduty/, accessed November 2022.  (36)  https://aws.amazon.com/cloudtrail/, accessed November 2022.

The assessment also focuses on the respondents’ perceived relevance of cloud services and  the relevance given to cloud cybersecurity regarding the amount of company digital assets and  sensitive data stored in the cloud. Indeed, when combining these last two pieces of information  (percentage of digital assets in the cloud and percentage of sensitive data stored in cloud  services (Figure 13)), the following observations can be made.  • 42 % of companies have a low cloud asset usage and low share of sensitive data  storage online;  • Another 42 % of companies have the opposite tendency, high cloud asset usage and  high share of sensitive data in the cloud;  • The remaining 17 % uses a high percentage of cloud assets but only stores a small  portion of sensitive data online.  These results reveal a divided market, with an almost perfect balance between two opposite  approaches (high and low overall cloud usage, in terms of assets and sensitive data) and a  smaller share of realities opting for a combination of the two.  Figure 13: Percentages of digital assets stored in the cloud  It is indicative that the ENISA cloud certification proposal (41) (EUCS) covers three assurance  levels: ‘Basic’, ‘Substantial’ and ‘High’. These assurance levels can be considered as  overlapping with the three demand-side clusters mentioned above. For example, a high  assurance level would be appropriate to cover cybersecurity requirements for users who have  highly sensitive data stored in the cloud and a heavy usage of cloud services.  4.2.  CLOUD CYBERSECURITY REQUIREMENTS  This section covers the most relevant requirements for cloud security services in terms of  compliance (general data protection regulation, sector-specific or organisational policies, etc.)  and business (availability and resilience, flexibility, business continuity, etc.). They concern  three main service aspects: compliance with regulation, guidelines and best practices; business  (41)  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/news/enisa-news/cloud-certification-scheme, accessed November 2022.  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/news/enisa-news/cloud-certification-scheme  CLOUD CYBERSECURITY MARKET ANALYSIS  Final | 1.0 | Public | March 2023  37  requirements; and other relevant requirements (i.e. geopolitical requirements, supply chain or  procurement rules, etc.).  Regarding compliance requirements (Figure 14), the perceptions of the supply and demand  sides are almost completely aligned, with a focus on enforcing privacy and data protection,  respecting guidelines, standards and best practices (e.g. ISO27001) and achieving compliance  with sector-specific standards (e.g. PCI DSS). The users (demand side) also highlight the  relevance of organisational policies.  Figure 14: Most relevant compliance requirements, supply vs demand perceptions  On the contrary, the relevance given to the different business requirements (see Figure 15)  varies: while demand companies mainly focus on the availability and resilience of services–  and, in a lower regard, on business continuity – suppliers assign a higher relevance to the shift  from Capital Expenditures (CAPEX) to Operational Expenditures (OPEX). Moreover, they give  more importance to requirements such as shorter time to market, the reduction of complexity,  audit and verification.  CLOUD CYBERSECURITY MARKET ANALYSIS  Final | 1.0 | Public | March 2023  38  Figure 15: Most relevant business requirements, supply vs demand perceptions  Other requirements (Figure 16) perceived as relevant by cloud service users (demand side) are  the use of certified services, compliance with geopolitical requirements and compliance with  supply chain/procurement rules. Suppliers agree on the crucial role of geopolitical obligations  but focus more on using certified services and certification schemes.  The shift from CAPEX to OPEX has been used for many years as the main argument to move  to the cloud, as businesses do not need high up-front investment in IT and can only pay for the  computing services they need. when they need them (OPEX model). However, in reality it  seems that this is not so important for the demand side, as opposed to the argument used by  the supply side.  One explanation could be that transition from one model to another proved to be challenging for  organisations with processes in place. While new start-ups do not have this problem, some  organisations that rely on the CAPEX model may be reluctant to shift to the cloud and relinquish  full control of their IT environment. In PaaS environments, for example, the developer often  decides what infrastructure or cloud services to use. This decision is based on performance or  technical concerns, without the cost being the main element for this decision. Losing oversight  or fear of decentralisation are probably the main reasons behind the small number of demand- side respondents supporting the ‘Shift from CAPEX to OPEX’ argument.  CLOUD CYBERSECURITY MARKET ANALYSIS  Final | 1.0 | Public | March 2023  39  Figure 16: Other relevant requirements  4.3.  INTERESTING OBSERVATIONS: CLOUD USAGE PATTERNS AND  REQUIREMENTS  1. Given that half of the demand-side respondents are smaller organisations, they are less  likely to use PaaS model; this was also confirmed by the survey. Application developers  interested in simplifying development and deployment mainly use PaaS. While PaaS  offerings were traditionally the least important service model in terms of revenue, they  recently became more widely adopted through the increased use of micro-service  architectures. Advanced application functionalities, supporting big data, AI and machine- learning capabilities, or the IoT might further drive the adoption of PaaS services, and this  segment could be an opportunity for the emerging cloud providers.  2. Similar conclusions hold for the adoption of private cloud services, where 40 % of the  adoption is in line with the type and size of demand-side respondents. Private cloud  services are usually contracted by larger users, which form about 50 % of respondents of  this study (see Figure 2).  3. The shift from CAPEX to OPEX has been used for many years as the main arguments to  move to the cloud, as businesses do not need high up-front investment in IT. They can pay  only for the computing services they need, and only when they use them (OPEX model).  However, it seems as this is not so important for the demand side, as opposed to the  argument used by the supply side.  The next bullet points set new hypotheses for later conclusions about threat perception.  4. Shared responsibility and ‘dichotomy of control’ in cloud computing usage patterns are  challenges where stakeholder perspectives might differ. While the demand side wants more  control through self-service and customisation, these options may also open new threat  vectors. The on-demand self-service provisioning features, for example, enable ‘shadow  IT’, which is the use of cloud services without an IT department’s consent. This can result in  unauthorised use of cloud services that in its turn may lead to an increase of malware  infections or data exfiltration incidents.  CLOUD CYBERSECURITY MARKET ANALYSIS  Final | 1.0 | Public | March 2023  40  5. Another related challenge is linked to the use of APIs to manage and interact with cloud  services. Such APIs may contain vulnerabilities, thus leading to a compromise of these  management services. These are a security responsibility of the supply side. This situation  may lead to diverging perceptions on related threat exposure between the supply and  demand sides.  6. Resource pooling in another attribute in high demand, where risks can outweigh benefits  for the demand side. While the benefits for public cloud providers are clear, security risks  for the supply side include reuse of resources by different tenant applications, the  positioning of services that belong to different tenants on the same server, and automated  processes that handle the allocation and de-allocation of resources at CSP level. Even in  the private cloud, where a virtual machine could be hosted on any of the servers in the  private cloud, there is a risk that the server might host applications and services that belong  to different security zones, with different authentication and authorisation needs.  CLOUD CYBERSECURITY MARKET ANALYSIS  Final | 1.0 | Public | March 2023  41  5. THREATS, CHALLENGES  AND CAPABILITIES  5.1.  CLOUD CYBERSECURITY: THREATS, CHALLENGES AND  CAPABILITIES  The cloud has many benefits and the potential to transform many businesses, but it has also  introduced new cybersecurity challenges and threats. One of the main differences with  ‘traditional’ cybersecurity is that cloud security is a shared responsibility model, with some  challenges and threats originating from its own nature as a cloud, such as we have seen in  Section 2.2.  Cybersecurity threats, challenges and capabilities constitute one of the focuses of this market  analysis. Cybersecurity threats are the reason why cloud services are being enhanced with  cybersecurity features, while cybersecurity challenges emerge from the necessity to reduce  threat exposure or the need to integrate cloud security with the existing security policies on the  customer side. The ability to implement necessary cybersecurity controls reflects the capability  levels on both the demand side and the supply side and is indicative of the level of management  of these threats.  Cloud cybersecurity threats, challenges and capabilities are a common subject of interest for all  the stakeholder types involved in this analysis. The information collected in this regard  constitutes a very good basis to compare views on threats and challenges, but also to assess  the perceived level of threat management.  5.1.1.  Cloud Cybersecurity Threats: Multiplicity of Perception within All  Stakeholder Types  The stakeholders’ perception of the most relevant cybersecurity threats (Figure 17) appears to  be generally aligned among the various stakeholder types, with particular attention given to the  lack of cloud security architecture and strategy, data breaches and abuse of misconfiguration  and inadequate change control. However, some differences are evident, namely the following.  • Demand and supply. Their perception is similar, as both dedicate particular attention to  data breaches and abuse of misconfiguration and inadequate change control. The only  evident difference concerns the abuse of insecure interfaces and APIs, which is not very  relevant for suppliers, while customers are far more worried by this threat. Moreover,  suppliers focus more on the abuse of misconfigurations and inadequate change control  or identity credentials, on the general lack of cloud security architecture and strategy and  on account hijacking.  • Regulatory bodies. Their perception of all threats is heightened compared to the other  actors. The only exceptions are insider threats and account hijacking, by a small margin;  • R & D. Contrary to regulatory bodies, research organisations give less importance than  other actors do to most cybersecurity threats, especially to abuse of insufficient identity,  credential access and key management, abuse of weak control planes and data  breaches. The only exception is insider threats, to which R & D bodies give particular  importance.  CLOUD CYBERSECURITY MARKET ANALYSIS  Final | 1.0 | Public | March 2023  42  Figure 17: Cloud cybersecurity threats, overview of perceptions from all stakeholder types  5.1.2. Cybersecurity Challenges and Level of Implementations  As mentioned in Section 2.4, cybersecurity challenges capture concerns which relate to both  demand and supply regarding the materialisation of a threat. In the current analysis,  cybersecurity challenges were used as a basis to firstly capture the concerns of surveyed  stakeholders; at the same time, cybersecurity challenges were used as an index to measure  implementation efforts to master those challenges. The summary of perceived cybersecurity  challenges provides a comprehensive overview of perceived challenges among all involved  stakeholder types (see Figure 18).  CLOUD CYBERSECURITY MARKET ANALYSIS  Final | 1.0 | Public | March 2023  43  Figure 18: Cloud cybersecurity challenges, overview of all involved stakeholder types  The fact that the list of cybersecurity challenges resembles cybersecurity control groups has  helped survey participants to express the level of implementation within their organisation.  Therefore, based on the collected data, the mastering of cybersecurity challenges is considered  within this analysis as indicative for the cybersecurity capability/maturity level of surveyed  organisations.  This section presents a series of complementary views on threats and challenges: firstly,  participating stakeholders were asked about their perceived level of management of cloud  cybersecurity threats. Secondly, the implementation status of countermeasures to master the  challenges was assessed. Both views are presented in the analysis below.  To reduce threat exposure– and consequently master cybersecurity challenges – organisations  are implementing several cybersecurity measures (Figure 19 and Figure 20): incident detection  and response, IAM, hardware and data security, cloud-native and application security, cloud  infrastructure security and policy enforcement, and antivirus and malware protection. Most  companies have already started to introduce all of the measures mentioned above or expect to  do so in the next 1–2 years, with the only relevant exception of value-added security services,  which 40 % of the supply-side sample companies expect to implement at a later stage (2–5  years); however, the other 60 % of companies have already implemented these services.  Overall, these results confirm the active approach both customers and suppliers have adopted  in enforcing cloud cybersecurity.  CLOUD CYBERSECURITY MARKET ANALYSIS  Final | 1.0 | Public | March 2023  44  Figure 19: Time range of implementation, demand side  Figure 20: Time range of implementation, supply side  Nonetheless, a lot remains to be done. Figure 21 depicts how the general perception on the  demand side is that a significant gap remains between the threats perceived and those  effectively managed, especially regarding the abuse of insecure interfaces and APIs and data  breaches.  A similar gap is registered when comparing perceived and managed cybersecurity threats for  supply companies (Figure 21B): indeed, the lack of incident management is evident, especially  concerning data breaches and abuse of misconfigurations and inadequate change control, two  of the most worrisome threats for all actors, as previously highlighted. However, on a more  CLOUD CYBERSECURITY MARKET ANALYSIS  Final | 1.0 | Public | March 2023  45  positive note, companies’ management of the abuse of insecure interfaces and APIs appears to  be particularly effective.  Results for R & D organisations (Figure 21D) are the most encouraging ones. Indeed, the  management of the following cybersecurity threats goes beyond the perceived threats:  • abuse of limited cloud usage visibility;  • abuse of insufficient identity, credentials, access and key management;  • abuse of insecure interfaces and APIs;  • meta-structure and appli-structure failures; and  • lack of cloud security architecture and strategy.  However, management of data breaches, account hijacking, abuse of weak control planes,  abuse of misconfigurations and inadequate change control and abuse of the nefarious use of  cloud services is still lacking.  Focusing on each stakeholder group, regulatory bodies assign the highest level of importance  to the chain of trust / chain of responsibility, while suppliers deem access control to be a bigger  challenge. Demand-side organisations focus more on audit and access control, and R & D  bodies give the most importance to incident management.  Shifting the focus on regulatory bodies (Figure 21C), once again, an important gap between  perceived threats and their management is evident, especially concerning the three most relevant  cybersecurity menaces (lack of cloud security architecture and strategy, data breaches and abuse  of misconfigurations and inadequate change control). Notably, reported perceived and managed  threats coincide with the abuse of insecure interfaces and APIs; abuse of insufficient identity,  credential access and key management; abuse of weak control planes; insider threats and other  (for example, data extraction for future decrypting); these results suggest that current strategies in  place are deemed adequate for these threats.

Regulatory bodies side, D. R & D side  5.2.  INCIDENTS AND VULNERABILITIES  In this section we provide an overview of the most impactful security incidents experienced  lately (in the last 12 months) by the cloud cybersecurity market and the cloud infrastructure  vulnerabilities registered, analysing the type and level of consequences they caused and the  relationship with the regulatory bodies in their management.  Before going into the analysis of the survey result, it is important to provide some statistics  related to cloud incidents and cloud vulnerabilities. The statistics below have been assessed via  available open-source publications.  • Number of cloud incidents in 2022. With some 53 % of cloud users suffering an incident  (attack) between 2020 and 2022 (42), there is a significant increase in the detection of  incidents, most commonly caused by phishing (73 %), account compromise (31 %),  ransomware and targeted attacks (29 %) and accidental data leakage (25 %). Remarkably,  incidents caused by these threats have doubled within this period. Consequently, the  percentage of targeted users is expected to continue growing over time.  (42)  https://www.netwrix.com/download/collaterals/Netwrix_Cloud_Data_Security_Report_2022.pdf,  accessed November 2022.  https://www.netwrix.com/download/collaterals/Netwrix_Cloud_Data_Security_Report_2022.pdf  CLOUD CYBERSECURITY MARKET ANALYSIS  Final | 1.0 | Public | March 2023  47  • Number of cloud vulnerabilities in 2022. Though the total number of cloud vulnerabilities  is difficult to assess, vulnerability statistics from a single cloud provider indicate that around  50 vulnerabilities were detected in 2021, around 13 % of them being critical (43). By  extrapolating this number to other major CSPs by analogy, one can easily equate this to  around a few hundred vulnerabilities on a yearly basis.  The impact of incidents reported by demand-side organisations (Figure 22) highlights that the  majority of reported cybersecurity incidents had low (73 %) or no impact (13 %). Only a  small portion (13 %) had a medium impact, and none caused high-level consequences.  These results suggest that even though great attention is devoted towards cybersecurity threats  and an overall sense that more could be done to reduce threat exposure, measures in place are  quite effective, at least in preventing incidents leading to serious consequences.  Figure 22: Demand-side experience with impactful incidents  When looking at the suppliers (Figure 23), the results confirm the effectiveness of the defensive  measures in place, which appear to be even more effective than in demand-side companies.  Indeed, in this case, the majority of causalities had no impact at all on the company (82 %),  while only a small portion had a low (9 %) or medium impact (9 %).

Given the number of cloud vulnerabilities registered in 2021 and the high  percentage of incidents (i.e. abused vulnerabilities), it is rather unlikely that used cloud services  were not affected by vulnerabilities.  Figure 24: Percentage of the demand -side that received vulnerability report  5.3.  INTERESTING OBSERVATIONS: THREATS, CHALLENGES AND  CAPABILITIES  1. Insider threats are also the most difficult threats to address. It is common concern for both  the demand-side and supply-side perspectives, but modelling of these threats (that include  human factors) is very difficult.  CLOUD CYBERSECURITY MARKET ANALYSIS  Final | 1.0 | Public | March 2023  49  2. Lack of visibility and transparency of cyberthreat management seems to be a topic that  needs to be considered, as it influences market adoption.  3. Differences in threat perception reveal some doubts about ‘shared model responsibility’ in  cloud security: the supply-side might minimise the probability of vulnerabilities in their APIs,  while the demand side would do the same for their misconfigurations.  4. Regulatory stakeholders give more importance to the chain of trust, as they take a more  holistic approach and deal with IT supply-chain security in general.  5. Incident management and audit scores are low on the supply side, which can be explained  by the fact that many CSPs are reluctant to share logs and give access to their cloud for  incident-management services.  6. When seen purely from a cybersecurity perspective, it seems that multi-tenancy is mainly  beneficial for the supply side, as it brings risks for the demand side. However, according to  the data collected, the perception is different.  7. Segments of cloud-native, application and cloud infrastructure cybersecurity and policy  enforcement show a high level of adoption, which is indicative of good cybersecurity  awareness from demand-side stakeholders.  8. Suppliers feel like they are ‘in control’ of API vulnerabilities, while considering ‘customer- side’ threats, such as misconfigurations, as a source of higher risk.  9. Given the relatively low level of vulnerability information communicated to the demand side,  it seems necessary to raise awareness and intensify notification on vulnerabilities both via  the cloud services and the applications used by all users of the cloud services. Eventually,  Service Level Agreements (SLAs) would need to be checked and potentially updated to  include vulnerability notifications to users of the service. New or emerging EU regulations  see vulnerability management as a central part of incident notification; such SLA updates  will hence be mandatory for a variety of products and services, especially the ones used in  critical sectors. If such a change is not made, it could turn into a barrier for market adoption.  CLOUD CYBERSECURITY MARKET ANALYSIS  Final | 1.0 | Public | March 2023  50  6. ROLE OF REGULATION  AND CERTIFICATION  The inclusion of regulatory bodies as a stakeholder type in this analysis has provided a  complementary perspective with regard to their scope, the regulatory instruments used and the  plans for their implementation. This section outlines the regulatory bodies’ influence on the  cloud cybersecurity market. Use of standards and certification constitutes the main instrument  for the fulfilment of cybersecurity requirements. As regards the use of certification, the survey  addresses intentions for the introduction of the EUCS. In addition, an analysis of the plan  developed by various regulatory bodies for its implementation (degree of penetration, timeline of  introduction, funds allocated) has been performed. This includes the EUCS’ impact on the  reduction of cybersecurity threats.  6.1.  TYPES OF REGULATORY ACTIVITIES IN CLOUD CYBERSECURITY  The regulatory supervision of the participated regulatory bodies concentrates on the following  core sectors: government (targeted by 75 % of the involved organisations), communications,  media and services (62 %), banking and security, utilities (50 %), education, manufacturing and  natural resources, transportation (38 %), insurance, healthcare providers (25 %), retail and  wholesale trade (12 %) (see Figure 25).  To quote one of the survey’s participants, ‘a cloud certification scheme is necessary to support a  secure digital single market, the digitalisation and competitiveness of European businesses and  the security of our citizens, businesses, and public administrations’.  Figure 25: Sectors falling into regulatory supervision  CLOUD CYBERSECURITY MARKET ANALYSIS  Final | 1.0 | Public | March 2023  51  However, this does not imply that the adoption of the EUCS will happen in the near future  (Figure 26). Indeed, 62 % of the interviewed regulatory bodies have no plan to transition to this  framework, and 25 % plan to transition, but likely not in the immediate future, as no resources  have been allocated to this intent. Only 12 % of the organisations have planned the transition  and allocated funds for it.  Figure 26: EUCS, an important emerging regulatory instrument  6.2.  THE ROLE OF CERTIFICATION IN CLOUD CYBERSECURITY  The scope of this section is to investigate certifications’ relevance for cloud cybersecurity  providers and the relative instruments used by regulatory bodies. The role of certification has  been assessed for the supply side, demand-side and bodies involved in regulation stakeholder  types. The details of the analysis are presented in the discussion below.  Supply side. Suppliers of cloud services were surveyed about the certifications they use for  their offerings, including about their service and deployment models and cloud attributes. The  certifications used cover both cybersecurity properties, but also process security and quality.  Figure 27 shows the used certifications and standards.  CLOUD CYBERSECURITY MARKET ANALYSIS  Final | 1.0 | Public | March 2023  52  Figure 27: Supply-side certification (standards, attestations, schemes, etc.)  Demand side. Cloud users were surveyed to assess their requirements in terms of certification  and standardisation and expectations regarding the used services. These requirements meet  both their compliance and cybersecurity protection needs. The assessed requirements reflect  the generic intention/desire to use certified services, rather than mentioning specific ones.  Figure 28 shows the percentage of demand-side organisations that use certified cloud services.  CLOUD CYBERSECURITY MARKET ANALYSIS  Final | 1.0 | Public | March 2023  53  Figure 28: Demand-side certification requirements  Regulatory bodies. Bodies involved in regulation consider cloud certification as an important  element for the implementation of cybersecurity protection, coming second among all available  regulatory instruments. It should be mentioned, however, that cybersecurity certification is part  of the EU Member States’ cloud compliance framework (44). Hence, cloud certification has a  potentially higher ranking, as indicated in Figure 31. Taking into consideration the plan to  transition to the EUCS, cloud certification seems to be one of the most important emerging  methods within EU regulatory bodies to achieve proper cybersecurity protection in the cloud  ecosystem (see Figure 26 and Figure 29).  Figure 29: Regulatory instruments  (44)  https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/cloud-computing, accessed November 2022.  https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/cloud-computing  CLOUD CYBERSECURITY MARKET ANALYSIS  Final | 1.0 | Public | March 2023  54  6.3.  INTERESTING OBSERVATIONS: ROLE OF REGULATION AND  CERTIFICATION  1. It is worth noting that a significant number of suppliers still do not use any certifications for  the offered services. It seems that the higher risk appetite of the demand side can be  explained either by the lack of cybersecurity awareness or by a higher prioritisation of  cost/performance issues. Nonetheless, the desire of the demand side to use certified  services (ca. 50 %) does not fully resonate with the supplier side, when considering the  level of supported certifications of offered cloud services.  2. Although the EUCS seems to have become an important EU instrument to achieve better  cybersecurity protection levels, it has not been sufficiently envisaged yet within  implementations in available cloud offerings. This is expected to change when regulators  make their transition to the EUCS in the future (see Figure 26).  .  CLOUD CYBERSECURITY MARKET ANALYSIS  Final | 1.0 | Public | March 2023  55  7. CLOUD CYBERSECURITY  MARKET TRENDS  7.1.  CLOUD CYBERSECURITY MARKET EVOLUTION  Analysis of the collected evidence indicates that cloud cybersecurity is an expanding market,  and most market actors agree that significant market gaps remain. According to demand-side  and supply-side companies and R & D organisations, these uncovered areas mainly concern  three cybersecurity areas/issues: i) privacy and data protection, ii) security-enhancing  technologies and regulation, and iii) the absence of a unified certification method.  The state of cloud cybersecurity and the quality of cloud regulation are perceived as the two  most impactful aspects for market development. This can be attested by the preference of  survey participants for multi-cloud cybersecurity strategies and SaaS solutions. In both cases,  regulatory activities and orchestrated cybersecurity controls are especially crucial. Survey  participants have indicated that deficiencies in this regard may significantly increase exposure  to cyberwarfare and cyberterrorism threats. Although the emergence of these threats has also  been assessed in this year’s ENISA Threat Landscape (45), these survey findings are mainly  motivated by the impressions of cloud stakeholders regarding current geopolitical  developments.  Demand-side companies are also particularly attentive to signs of instability in the market,  paying particular attention to the monopolistic position assumed by hyperscalers. As a matter of  fact, even though the drive to innovate in the field of cybersecurity is lacking momentum,  solutions and cybersecurity controls are gradually being adopted on an individual level.  Concerning cybersecurity drivers, the focus of customers and suppliers is on building a resilient,  trustworthy and highly available cloud environment, incorporating new elements such as deep  integration, IoT, zero-trust security, cloud automation, quantum computing, 5G and the adoption  of AI in cloud services.  7.2.  CLOUD CYBERSECURITY DRIVERS AND BARRIERS  The aim of this section is to investigate the technological and business drivers for the cloud  cybersecurity ecosystem and the relative barriers encountered. In particular, the analysis shifts  beyond cloud cybersecurity-market stakeholder types, investigating the drivers and barriers of  regulatory bodies and R & D initiatives in promoting regulatory compliance and research uptake.  In addition, we analyse the main instruments for research and innovation funding and the  implementation issues (such as lack of skills) encountered in R & D projects.  The technological barriers reported by regulatory bodies (Figure 30) mainly concern four  aspects: access to standards, missing technological equipment (both encountered by 50 % of  interviewed organisations), lack of technological investments (62 % of organisations) and lack of  skills. The latter emerges as the most relevant barrier, as all organisations face it.  (45)  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/enisa-threat-landscape-2022, accessed December 2022.  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/enisa-threat-landscape-2022  CLOUD CYBERSECURITY MARKET ANALYSIS  Final | 1.0 | Public | March 2023  56  Figure 30: Technological barriers according to regulatory bodies  Concerning regulatory barriers (Figure 31), the main limitations registered are a lack of  incentives on the industry side (reported by 43 % of organisations), the already mentioned low  access to standards (57 %), the high implementation costs (71 %) and the lack of skills (86 %).  Analysing these answers and comparing them against the ones concerning technological  barriers, it is possible to conclude that the most critical barriers encountered by regulators are  the lack of resources, the low access to generalised standards and the lack of skills in relevant  organisations, with a significant impact on the ecosystem of cloud cybersecurity.  Figure 31: Main regulatory compliance barriers according to regulatory bodies  Shifting our focus from barriers to drivers for promoting regulatory compliance (Figure 32),  according to regulatory bodies, the most relevant ones are market measures (for 38 % of  interviewed organisations), consumer campaigns (50 %), pilot projects (75 %) and support for  SMEs, namely in the form of monetary incentives (88 %).  Figure 32: Drivers for promoting regulatory compliance according to Regulatory Bodies  Regarding R & D organisations, the surveyed organisations highlighted three main technological  barriers: lack of technological equipment (20 % of R & D bodies); missing access to product  IPRs (40 %) and missing access to standards (40 %) (see also Figure 33).  CLOUD CYBERSECURITY MARKET ANALYSIS  Final | 1.0 | Public | March 2023  57  Figure 33: Technological barriers encountered by R & D organisations  The lack of skills, a barrier already highlighted by regulatory bodies, is also relevant in R & D  organisations (Figure 34). Indeed, half of the interviewed organisations denote a lack of  researcher skills, cybersecurity skills and cloud computing skills, and brain drain; a smaller  proportion (25 %) also report a high fluctuation of skilled personnel.  Figure 34: Lack of skills in research and development organisations  Another relevant barrier for R & D in cloud cybersecurity is the accessibility to research funding  (Figure 35): all organisations state that they face problems in procuring financial resources, with  difficulty levels ranging from ‘challenging’ to ‘hard’.  Figure 35: Accessibility of research funding for research and development organisations  Concerning research funding instruments (Figure 36), R & D organisations rely on EU funds (83  %), mixed funds (private and public) (50 %) or private financing only (33 %). A smaller  CLOUD CYBERSECURITY MARKET ANALYSIS  Final | 1.0 | Public | March 2023  58  proportion (17 % of organisations) also receives funds from local governments, international  governments or international organisations.  Figure 36: Most important instruments for research funding according to R & D organisations  All R & D organisations agree that innovation actions are a core driver in promoting research  and innovation (Figure 37). Moreover, 40 % of the interviewed realities also highlight the  importance of market domination and certification schemes. A smaller percentage (20 %)  indicate missing investments and support for start-ups (namely through incentives) as relevant  drivers for cloud cybersecurity research.  Figure 37: Market/financial/economic/societal drivers according to R & D organisations  7.3. Cloud cybersecurity innovation areas  This section provides an overview of the trending topics in cybersecurity research, identifying  the market’s research and innovation priorities. Current research could develop into future  technology trends, which may one day influence the market; it is therefore crucial to determine  which research topics are considered particularly relevant in the market (supply and demand)  and compare this information with current R & D activity, assessing the state of play in research.  This allows us to estimate the readiness of available technology research results for market  deployment, the impact of adopting new technologies in the market and the time horizons for  technology adoption.  According to the surveyed R & D organisations, the most relevant research topics in cloud  computing related to cybersecurity (Figure 38) are security and integrity; secure computation  outsourcing and privacy in multi-tenancy clouds (all mentioned by 60 % of the involved  organisations); secure mobile cloud computing / fog computing / edge computing and secure  cloud architecture (both at 40 %); virtualisation security; data recovery and backup; cloud  access control and key management; availability; recovery and auditing and other topics (such  as cybersecurity certification and automation) (all at 20 %).  CLOUD CYBERSECURITY MARKET ANALYSIS  Final | 1.0 | Public | March 2023  59  Figure 38: Important researched cybersecurity topics according to R & D organisations  Considering instead cloud computing developments that are already in place and used beyond  research, according to R & D organisations, the most impactful ones (Figure 39) are:  • zero-trust models/architectures (according to 83 % of organisations);  • secure software-development life cycle (SDLC) and DevSecOps for the cloud (83 %);  • cloud-native security tools and platforms (67 %);  • hybrid and multi-cloud environments (50 %);  • other developments, such as automation and AI (17 %).  Figure 39: Impactful cloud computing developments for cybersecurity according to R & D  organisations  7.4. INTERESTING OBSERVATIONS: CLOUD CYBERSECURITY MARKET  TRENDS  1. The comparison between these results and the research priorities for market actors (supply  and demand companies) leads to some interesting insights. Indeed, their interests are  mainly focused on two research streams: privacy and security for the cloud (privacy- enhancing technologies, double encryption, etc.), and innovative technologies (AI, 5G,  CLOUD CYBERSECURITY MARKET ANALYSIS  Final | 1.0 | Public | March 2023  60  quantum computing, superconducting microchips, etc.). While the first research priority  coincides with the information reported by R & D companies, the second stream of activities  does not seem to be a current focus area for cloud cybersecurity R & D organisations.  2. Availability of standards seems to be a significant barrier for both regulatory bodies and R &  D. Although this barrier is well known, no significant corrective measures have been  implemented so far in the EU.  3. Skill shortage seems to be another common barrier. As it is obvious that available skilled  personnel will switch to better paid jobs in the industry, it might be necessary to achieve  better remunerations and/or to ‘pool’ skills by means of public institutions. At the same time,  it is important to foster the creation of corresponding curricula at universities.  4. Innovation areas identified may be an important stepping stone for short-term research, but  also market drivers and market trends.

CONCLUDING REMARKS  In this chapter, conclusions are drawn on the basis of the findings of this cybersecurity market  analysis. The conclusions of this section constitute a synthesis of interesting observations made  in the different Chapters (Chapters 1 to 7) of this analysis, while comparing this against  evidence found in available cloud computing studies. In doing so we:  • use the evidence presented so far by means of findings from the survey, interesting  observations and identified cross-cutting issues;  • seek to validate conclusions by comparing findings to existing cloud reports, obtained  through open-source research (corresponding references can be found in each conclusion  by means of footnotes); and  • highlight the different stakeholder types concerned by each conclusion.  The above elements are included in each conclusion by means of references to interesting  points and similar conclusions found in open-source reports and /references to the concerned  cloud stakeholder types. Within each section, the conclusions drawn are enumerated to  facilitate identification and referencing.  It should be noted that the conclusions drawn do not exhaust all interesting observations of  each of the Chapters 1 to 7. We recommend that interested readers visit this material in order to  gain a better understanding – on a second level of detail – all the interesting topics identified in  this analysis.  Another important note to be made is that the content of these conclusions is not overlap-free:  some of the conclusions below might touch upon issues mentioned in another conclusion  category (sub-section). For example, a conclusion on market trends may affect research issues  and vice-versa. When possible, we have indicated where the content overlaps.  8.1. CONCLUSIONS ON MARKET CHARACTERISTICS AND TRENDS  1. Many demand-side stakeholders are using security services from the same companies that  also provide cloud services, as a kind of ‘bundled offering’, but it is in reality very difficult to  establish market patterns when it comes to security products and services, whether these  are offered directly by the CSPs themselves, by enablers or partners of CSPs, or by  independent suppliers contracted by cloud service consumers (CSCs). In this respect, the  market can be said to be ‘blurred’, as security products/services are bundled with all- inclusive services in such a way as to dilute their distinguishable features.  Evidence from observations: Observations 4 and 5 in Section 3.5, Observation 5 in Section  4.3.  Relevant stakeholder types: supply side, demand side.  2. About 40 % of respondents consider secure mobile cloud computing /fog computing / edge  computing and secure cloud architectures to be the most relevant research topics (see  Figure 38), which echoes the opportunities outlined in the EU report elaborated following  the CEO roundtable ‘Shaping the next generation cloud supply for Europe’ and addressed  to Thierry Breton, European Commissioner for the Internal Market (46).

Secure access service edge (SASE) is presented as an opportunity for  EU players, including a new network security model that combines multiple controls such  as zero-trust network access, a Cloud Access Security Broker (CASB), firewall as a service  and data loss protection. Secure Access in 5G Mobile Networks will lead to the integration  of end-to-end service orchestration of SD-WAN, SASE and mobile networks across the  entire solution.  Evidence from observations: Observations 4 and 5 in Section 3.5, Observation 5 in Section  4.3.  Relevant stakeholder types: supply side, R & D, demand side.  3. While some SASE solutions include the CASB functionality as part of their offering, these  two solutions/functionalities are likely to co-exist, a least for some time. In addition, SASE  looks more like a framework that combines network security and wide-area networking than  a concrete security solution. Its vendors follow an ‘all in one’ approach, as opposed to  security-solution integration or ‘chaining’ done by customers or system integrators on their  behalf. While further service and product consolidation is desirable and expected, in  Gartner’s hype cycle for cloud security for 2021 (47), SASE is at the peak of inflated  expectations.  Evidence from observations: NA (derived as a cross-cutting analysis conclusion).  Relevant stakeholder types: supply side, demand side, R & D.  4. About 60 % of respondents find secure computation outsourcing and privacy in multi- tenancy cloud systems to be the important challenge (48) (see also Figure 38), while 50 %  are planning to implement data-security solutions, which reveals opportunities in emerging  sub-segments such as confidential computing, a technology that mentioned in Gartner’s  hype cycle for cloud security in 2020 and 2021 (49). Confidential computing is a mechanism  that protects sensitive code and data from third parties, including the CSP. Indeed,  confidential computing protects data while it is ‘in use’, or as it is being processed, thus  bridging a gap in common encryption protection that focuses on data at rest or in transit.  Confidential computing is particularly relevant in the context of in-cloud use of data.  Confidential computing also makes it easier to move between different cloud environments  without exposing any sensitive data and is adequate for the scenarios where there is no  mutual trust. In the EU there are already several companies, mainly start-ups, working on  this technology, as well as some mature research on trusted execution environments, multi- party computation and other related topics, which could be an opportunity for EU suppliers.  Ensuring that start-ups working on these technologies receive adequate funding to grow  and become pervasive in cloud computing environments is paramount to ensuring that  security concerns about cloud services are addressed. Furthermore, given the importance  that these market actors have and the protection that they afford users, a certification  scheme laying down qualitative expectations for these organisations’ products might prove  useful.

SDLC and DevSecOps for the cloud were considered as impactful developments by 83 %  of R & D respondents (Figure 39). In addition, 43 % of customers and 62 % of suppliers  plan to implement some solutions related to cloud-native and application security (Figure 19  and Figure 20, respectively). Similar to the intersection of networking and security, in this  area there is a consolidation of features and capabilities provided by previously separated  tools. A cloud-native application protection platform is a segment addressing both SDLC  and the traditional gap between security and DevOps teams, while its focus is on the cloud- native ecosystem. This segment is also halfway between evolution and convergence of  cloud security posture management and cloud workload protection platforms, and is also  expected to consolidate cloud service network security, which in turn has replaced  mechanisms such as a web application firewalls or web application and API protection.  Evidence from observations: Observation 4, Section 7.4.  Relevant stakeholder types: R & D, supply side, demand side.  6. Among cloud security product companies, there are those that address the same security  concerns as ‘on-premises IT’ but adapted to the cloud, while others address security  concerns unique to the cloud. Emerging consolidation is also visible in this area, which  makes procurement very difficult. Some cloud-security segments overlap, while other raise  doubts regarding different alternatives: should customers choose one single vendor that  unifies many different cloud security controls (integration), or should they opt for separated  solutions (‘chaining’ of controls)? This is a question that needs to be further researched and  which may lead to some added-value offerings from suppliers (especially enablers).  Evidence from observations: NA (derived as a cross-cutting analysis conclusion).  Relevant stakeholder types: supply side, demand side.  8.2. CONCLUSIONS EMERGING FROM VARIATING PERCEPTIONS AND  POTENTIAL GAPS  1. The 2021 AWS Cloud Security Report (50), based on a comprehensive survey of 316  cybersecurity professionals and focused on responses to new security threats, noted that  configuration is the top concern (71 %), exfiltration of sensitive data comes second (59 %),  and insecure APIs comes third (54 %). In our survey, misconfigurations scored high as a  threat with supply-side respondents (75 %, see Figure 21), with the highest gap between  perceived and managed threats. On the demand side, this gap is not as big for this specific  threat, but becomes significant when it comes to insecure APIs, which are perceived as a  threat by 60 % of demand-side respondents (see Figure 21).  Evidence from observations: Observations 3 and 8 in Section 5.3 and Observation 5 in  Section 4.3.  Relevant stakeholder types: supply side, demand side.  2.  Misconfigurations scored high as a threat with supply-side respondents (around 75 %, see  Figure 21), with the highest gap between perceived and managed threats. However, there  are different kinds of misconfigurations in the cloud, related to the different responsibilities  of CSPs and CSCs, and different tools and controls that deal with this threat. Infrastructure- as-code scanning, for example, is a form of automation to minimise cloud misconfiguration  risks, as it ensures code quality of the cloud infrastructure configuration files. Cloud  infrastructure entitlements management – which appeared as a separated cloud security  segment very recently –deals, among other things, with IAM misconfigurations. Both  solutions are increasingly being seen as yet another feature of the cloud-native application  protection platform. Furthermore, customers said they require some (53 %) or extensive (20  (50)  https://www.cybersecurity-insiders.com/portfolio/2021-aws-cloud-security-report-cloudpassage/,  accessed November 2022.  https://www.cybersecurity-insiders.com/portfolio/2021-aws-cloud-security-report-cloudpassage/  CLOUD CYBERSECURITY MARKET ANALYSIS  Final | 1.0 | Public | March 2023  64  %) help with the customisation of cloud applications, including security configurations (51).  This also shows that beyond specific cloud-service solutions, there is still a large demand  for cloud security enablers, i.e. companies that act on behalf of the customer, implement,  integrate or deploy different cloud security solutions.  Evidence from observations: Observation 3 and 8 in Section 5.3.  Relevant stakeholder types: supply side, demand side.  3. CSPs prioritised ‘security of the cloud’, in other words keeping their cloud infrastructure and  stack secure, which is not always their responsibility. They also offer some security  services – such as monitoring, detection, and security management services – to their  clients, which can be bundled together with cloud services or provided separately. A CSC  cannot presume that the vendor of their cloud environment will be entirely responsible for  security; they need to look for the best solution through additional investment in products  and services. The absence of clearly delimited responsibilities leads to both uncertainties,  the risk of over - or underlaps and increased resources requirements. Making CSPs fully  responsible may solve this problem. The key consideration is currently the ‘shared  responsibility model’, often linked to a service-level agreement.  Evidence from observations: Observation 9 in Section 5.3.  Relevant stakeholder types: supply side, demand side.  4.  Threats such as abuse of insufficient or inappropriate identity, credentials, access and key  management are perceived as important both by suppliers (over 50 %, see Figure 21) and  by demand-side respondents (around 50 %, see Figure 21). While cloud IAM solutions exist  and are used (implemented by 84 % of demand-side respondents according to the survey,  see Figure 19), they have limitations in the multi-cloud environment. Each CSP has its own  policies, and mapping permissions across different platforms at scale is a challenge; for this  reason, organisations also use Cloud Infrastructure Entitlements Management (CIEM). This  is a topic that needs further elaboration in order to obtain a more efficient deployment and  use of available controls on both sides (supply and demand). Eventual involvement of  R & D might facilitate the identification of possible solutions in this regard (52).  Evidence from observations: NA (derived as a cross-cutting analysis conclusion).  Relevant stakeholder types: supply side, demand side, R & D.  8.3. CONCLUSIONS ON MARKET BARRIERS  1. Lack of visibility and transparency and related threats are perceived very differently in our  survey by suppliers (around 25 %, see Figure 21) and demand-side respondents (almost  25 %, see Figure 21). This observation is confirmed in the 2022 Fortinet Cloud Security  Report (by 49 % of respondents) (53). As differences in perceptions are important barriers  for market adoption, one can argue that the entire conclusions of Section 8.2 can be  considered as issues to be addressed for a better adoption of cloud cybersecurity  throughout the market both within the EU and internationally.  Evidence from observations: Observation 2 in Section 5.3.  Relevant stakeholder types: supply side, demand side.  2. Lack of skills also emerges as the most relevant barrier for adoption, as perceived by all  stakeholders (around 78 % of all respondents on average, see Figure 30, Figure 31, Figure  34). In (ISC)2’s 2022 Cloud Security Report (54), 78 % of respondents claimed that  (51)  https://tbri.com/tbr-insight-center/cloud-and-software-competitive-intelligence/customer-  research/cloud-applications/, accessed November 2022.

Evidence from observations: Observation 3 in Section 7.4.  Relevant stakeholder types: supply side, regulatory bodies, R & D.  3. It bears noting that a significant amount of supplier still do not hold any certifications for the  offered services. On the other hand, it seems that the higher risk appetite of the demand  side can be explained either by the lack of cybersecurity awareness or by a higher  prioritisation of cost/performance issues. Nonetheless, the desire of the demand side to use  certified services (around 50 %), does not fully resonate with the supply side, when  considering the adoption level of the existing cloud service certifications. This may be  considered as another barrier for the adoption of cloud services, especially when  compliance requirements on the demand side do matter (e.g. financial sector, other critical  sectors).  Evidence from observations: Observation 9 in Section 6.3 (almost as is).  Relevant stakeholder types: supply side, demand side, regulatory bodies.  4. Availability of standards and necessary IPRs seems to be a significant barrier for both  regulatory bodies and R & D. Although this barrier is well-known in almost all domains, no  significant corrective measures have been implemented so far in the EU.  Evidence from observations: Observation 2 in Section 6.3 (almost as is).  Relevant stakeholder types: supply side, regulatory bodies, R & D.  5. Given the relatively low level of vulnerability information communicated to the demand side,  it seems necessary to raise awareness and intensify notification on existing vulnerabilities  both in the cloud services and the used applications for all users of the cloud services.  Eventually, SLAs would need to be checked and potentially updated to include vulnerability  notification to users of the service. New or emerging EU regulations see vulnerability  management as a central part of incident notification, therefore such SLA updates will be  mandatory for a variety of products and services, especially the ones used in critical  sectors. If such a change is not made, it could turn into a barrier for market adoption.  Evidence from observations: Observation 2 in Section 5.3 (as is).  Relevant stakeholder types: supply side, demand side, regulatory bodies.  8.4. CONCLUSIONS ON RESEARCH AND INNOVATION TOPICS  1. Zero-trust model/architectures also confirmed in our survey as one of the main  developments in cloud computing that may be impactful for cybersecurity, according to  83 % of organisations (Figure 39). This is confirmed by market trends (55), where SASE  vendors are already incorporating functionalities or capabilities of zero trust, while replacing  or converging with other cybersecurity capabilities and tools such as the virtual private  network (VPN) or even capabilities of more recent solutions such as the (CASB)  functionality. Cloud infrastructure security and policy enforcement was considered to be  implemented by around 37 % of the respondents in our study, which shows how important  this area is (Figure 19).

The comparison between the analysis results of the chapter on cybersecurity market trends  (see Chapter 7) and the research priorities for market actors (demand-side and supply-side  organisations) leads to some interesting insights. Indeed, assessed demand-side and  supply-side trends mainly focus on two research streams: privacy and security for the cloud  (privacy-enhancing technologies, double encryption, etc.) and innovative technologies (AI,  5G, quantum computing, superconducting microchips, etc.). While the first research priority  coincides with the information reported by R & D companies, the second stream of activities  does not seem to be a current focus of R & D organisations. Hence, these areas might be  excellent candidates for a deployment action, given the fact that the underlying  technologies have matured and that corresponding products do exist (e.g. AI, 5G), while  other technologies are in the advanced prototype phase (e.g. quantum computing and  supercomputing).  Evidence from observations: Observation 1 in Section 7.4 (almost as is).  Relevant stakeholder types: R & D, supply side, demand side.  8.5. FURTHER CONSIDERATIONS AND PROJECTIONS  Beyond the conclusion formulated above, both this analysis and the open-source research  performed have revealed some additional points that are worth analysing, in order to gain  valuable insights into future market developments. They mainly concern possible paths through  which vendors might evolve their market strategies in order to use emerging market  opportunities. One of the main dilemmas on the demand side is related to the strategy regarding  the so-called ‘cloud ecosystem’ around hyperscalers (mainly Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure and  AWS).  There are important trends in these strategies. The Microsoft Partner Network (with 400 000  member organisations) became the Microsoft Cloud Partner Program in October 2022, targeting  all partners in the ecosystem, for companies selling services, software solutions or devices. Six  solution areas are aligned to Microsoft market strategy: Data & AI (Azure), Infrastructure (Azure),  Digital & App Innovation (Azure), Business Applications, Modern Work and Security. Microsoft will  divide partners into ‘peers’, according to their capability score.  In this ecosystem, we include all types of ‘vendors’: there are smaller CSPs, but also what we call  ‘enablers’. Enablers are organisations offering advisory and consulting services, cloud security- system integration, cloud security products, application development services and cloud security  operations, management and maintenance. We should also not forget that some CSPs are on  ‘both sides’, acting as a customer of large hyperscalers, but also as a provider for the customers  further down the value chain (this is the case for many organisations that rely on IaaS to provide  their SaaS services). In our survey we included many types of enablers, including resellers,  administrators and integrators.  While hyperscalers increasingly try to provide end-to-end services within a single-cloud vendor  scenario, large system integrators reorient their strategy towards orchestration, including  deployment of different cloud services in multi-cloud and hybrid-cloud settings. Most of these  vendors are part of all three hyperscaler ecosystems and generate revenue from all three. Finally,  in some cases, a joint venture between CSP and system integrators or consulting companies is  established.  Hyperscalers have their own service branch: Microsoft has enterprise services (in 2020  Microsoft’s consulting services were also launched), AWS has global services, Proserve and  AWS have managed services, while Google has a cloud professional services organisation.  However, a headcount of these service organisations reveals that the number of trained  professionals in the partner ecosystem is still much higher than in CSP professional service  branches. While cloud professional services are estimated to be around 38 % of the overall cloud  CLOUD CYBERSECURITY MARKET ANALYSIS  Final | 1.0 | Public | March 2023  67  market in 2021 (56), we estimated that 90 % of that revenue belongs to partners in hyperscalers  and other CSP ecosystems.  These considerations are indicative. It might be interesting to perform a dedicated analysis in  the area of cloud computing strategies to identify the potential and prospective market footprint.  Though quite specific, such an analysis could be performed either by means of an appropriately  scoped market analysis or as a foresight exercise, possibly via an EU-funded research project.

The selection of this segment for this year’s cybersecurity market analysis  is the result of a poll carried out with the involvement of multiple stakeholders, both outside and  within ENISA. The criteria used for the prioritisation of the collected proposals were the size of  the relevant market, the importance and criticality of the market for businesses of all sizes,  relevance of the sector to EU policy, relevance to research and relevance to regulatory  activities.  For this analysis, ENISA has performed primary research, that is, a survey involving the main  stakeholder types of the cloud computing ecosystem by means of dedicated questionnaires.  The quantitative information from the survey has been validated via qualitative information  obtained through open-source information, as well as by means of quality assurance by various  external experts, including the members of the ENISA Ad Hoc Working Group on Cybersecurity  Market Analysis.  By collecting information from various stakeholder types of the cloud ecosystem, we were in the  position to assess stakeholder-specific perspectives on cloud cybersecurity. Differences among  stakeholder perspectives are key to understand differences in viewpoints, requirements,  capability levels, perceptions about threats and challenges, compliance, etc. These variating  views are – in many cases – indicative of potential market trends, market barriers, market and  research gaps, skill shortages, the existence of market niches, etc. The conclusions of this  report capture many of these topics, in particular the following ones.  • Market characteristics and market trends. A variety of cybersecurity market  characteristics and market trends are presented, including manageability of offered  cybersecurity functions, technical integration options for various cybersecurity functions,  the role of data privacy, consolidation of on-premises and off-premises security (see  Section 8.1).  • Market barriers. Factors leading to difficulties in the market adoption of cloud computing  services have been identified, in particular variating perceptions about the level of threat  management by various cybersecurity functions, lack of cybersecurity skills in most of the  stakeholders of the cloud ecosystem, the reduced level of adoption of cybersecurity- related certifications, low availability of standards and intellectual property rights (IPRs), as  well as distortions in the flow of vulnerability and incident information among the cloud  stakeholders (see Section 8.3).  • Market gaps. Various gaps in the cloud cybersecurity market emerge through mismatches  in deployment of cybersecurity functions between the demand side and supply side. The  market gaps are rooted in concerns about the management of various threats and unclear  distributions responsibilities about the implementation and maintenance of cloud  cybersecurity functions (see Section 8.2).  • Research and innovation. Some clear indications about the importance of zero-trust  architectures, the use of privacy enhancing technologies and the impact of cloud  technology in artificial intelligence, 5G and quantum computing make these topics  excellent candidates for research and deployment actions (see Section 8.4).

A number of reflections regarding the future paths for the  development of the supply of cloud cybersecurity services have been formulated. These  are mainly attempts to properly orchestrate cybersecurity services, where different  approaches will be implemented, depending on the nature of cloud suppliers (for example  hyperscalers and cloud enablers) (see Section 8.5).  Besides the analyses and conclusions presented in this document, there is some additional  material in this work that may be interesting for a number of stakeholders. This includes  collected raw data, developed questionnaires, details of the various stakeholder perceptions,  scoping information, as well as the tools and processes used. ENISA is open to share any kind  of information resulting from this cybersecurity market analysis with interested stakeholders.  CLOUD CYBERSECURITY MARKET ANALYSIS  Final | 1.0 | Public | March 2023  7  1. INTRODUCTION  The present report on cloud cybersecurity market analysis is the result of an activity planned in  the European Union Agency for Cybersecurity (ENISA)’s Work Programme 2022 (3), under  activity O.7.1.: ‘Market analysis on the main trends in the cybersecurity market on both the  demand side and the supply side’. Elaborations on the market uptake of cybersecurity products,  services and processes contribute toward the ENISA strategic objective of ‘A high level of trust  in secure digital solutions’.  Market analysis at ENISA is performed on an annual basis, delivering each year an analysis of  a market sector that has been selected by several of ENISA’s stakeholders. For 2022, the area  of cloud cybersecurity market analysis has been selected. Various factors have contributed to  this selection, namely: the activities in the area of cybersecurity certification through the  European Union Cybersecurity Certification Scheme for Cloud Services (EUCS), the emergence  of various technological factors that will influence this important market segment (e.g. artificial  intelligence (AI), 5G), the wish to foster EU innovation based on research results in this area,  ongoing/emerging regulatory actions both at EU and Member-State level. With this work, ENISA  seeks to provide market intelligence in this domain, in order to facilitate all these activities.  With this objective in mind, primary research has been performed on the basis of a survey that  was developed and conducted by ENISA with the support of the ENISA Ad Hoc Working Group  on Cybersecurity Market Analysis (4) and some external experts. The entire work has been  conducted via processes and activities as described in the ENISA Cybersecurity Market  Analysis Framework (ECSMAF). What is more, this year’s work has served as a thorough test  of ECSMAF; the experience gained has been fed back to the ENISA framework and has led to  an updated version of ECSMAF V.2 (5).  This report is the outcome of this ENISA analysis. It contains the most important findings from  the survey, which are oriented towards the various target groups of this report, these being the  following.  • EU institutions, bodies and agencies. Market analyses are important to help  policymakers understand trends and related supply and demand issues.  • National public authorities, in particular bodies involved in regulation. Market  surveillance is the main instrument for efficient regulatory policies.  • ENISA stakeholder groups (e.g. the European Cybersecurity Certification Group,  Stakeholder Cybersecurity Certification Group, and ENISA Advisory Group). Market  intelligence may support decision-making for prioritising various cybersecurity efforts and  spotting market gaps.  • Industry and cross-sectoral associations. Market analyses allow them to analyse  market opportunities, trends, challenges and vulnerabilities and allow for the creation of  competitive advantages for EU industry players.  • Consumer organisations and associations. Market analyses allow them to comprehend  the needs and requirements of consumers for cybersecurity products, services and  processes, and their prospects in the European cybersecurity market.

They can use the proposed  methodology to assess the maturity of existing products and markets and guide the  development of new technologies and services.  As a final note, one should underline that this activity has value that goes beyond the content of  this report, which lies mainly in the fact that an entire market analysis life-cycle process was  performed. Numerous other side products of this life cycle may also be useful to a variety of  stakeholders: scoping information, generated questionnaires, threat assessments, raw data  collected, etc. This material bears a high potential for reuse, re-scoping and adaptation to other  purposes, among other things. Last but not least, by performing a complete market analysis life  cycle, ENISA is in the position to transfer this knowledge to interested parties and/or elaborate  on integration and use-cases with relevant cybersecurity disciplines, thereby creating a win-win  situation.  1.1.  SCOPING OF THE CLOUD CYBERSECURITY ANALYSIS  Performed in accordance with the ECSMAF (5), the present analysis of the cloud cybersecurity  market has been initiated through a scoping activity. The objective of scoping is manifold.  • To agree on the depth and breadth of the analysis, by focusing on the relevant  cybersecurity market elements according to their importance (i.e. role for the supplier, role  for the demand side, level of exposure to threats). The agreement for the current analysis  included the members of the ENISA Ad Hoc Working Group on Cybersecurity Market  Analysis, stakeholders of ENISA (ENISA Advisory Group and National Liaison Officers  Network), as well as ENISA internal groups.  • To make sure that the analysis effort can be performed with the available resources  (human and monetary) within the available time.  • To identify the data collection method (primary, secondary).  • To identify the groups participating in the validation of the intermediate and final results of  the analysis.  As proposed in the ECSMAF, the focus of the current cybersecurity market analysis has been  set in such a way as to cover the important concerns and perceptions of the various  stakeholders of the cloud computing ecosystem:  • the demand side, which includes the end users of cloud services;  • the supply side, which includes cloud service providers (CSPs) and cloud enablers;  • organisations conducting R & D in cloud computing;  • bodies involved in regulation, covering regulatory activities in could computing.  Detailed descriptions and profiles of these stakeholders can be found in Section 2.1.1.  The focus of the present cloud cybersecurity market analysis is summarised in Table 1. The  detailed scoping of the analysis can be found in Annex B.

The consequences of the above scoping decision for the  collected and analysed information are discussed below.  Focus, content and structure of the collected market information  The current analysis aims at highlighting the cybersecurity-related properties of cloud  offerings. Moreover, it embraces the perceptions of the stakeholders of the cloud ecosystem, by  analysing their cybersecurity and business requirements, their needs and the impact of service  deployment towards reduced exposure to cyberthreats. The following elements are taking into  consideration in the market analysis:  • Collection of stakeholder perspectives on equal or similar issues. By asking  questions about various cybersecurity-related matters of cloud services to a variety of  stakeholder types, their viewpoints can be compared and various interesting points can  be identified (i.e. similarities and gaps in perception, differentiated requirements,  various views of relevant threats, etc.). Most of the sections of this analysis present  such views in a comparative manner.  • Emphasis on the cybersecurity details of the offerings. Instead of looking at  generic market figures, the cybersecurity analysis conducted concentrates on the  cybersecurity-related properties of the service. This creates a specific angle of analysis  that is merely based on the conception and consumption of the cybersecurity  characteristics of the service.  • Emphasis on cybersecurity threats and challenges. A basic element in the  conducted analysis is the ability of a service to reduce exposure to cyberthreats and to  help master cybersecurity challenges. By taking into account data on cyberthreat  exposure and cybersecurity challenges for cloud services, we generate a multi- stakeholder perception of the central cybersecurity properties of the analysed service.  • Assessment of necessary capabilities, market drivers and barriers. A number of  important market success parameters are also taken into account. Adequate demand- side capabilities to efficiently deploy the service is an important adoption criterion.  Similarly, market divers (and its antipode, market barriers) are decisive factors towards  achieving market vitalisation and the successful launch of a product/service.  CLOUD CYBERSECURITY MARKET ANALYSIS  Final | 1.0 | Public | March 2023  11  Market information that is outside the focus of the analysis  Given the selected scope of the cloud cybersecurity analysis, we have neither collected  economic/financial figures regarding supply and demand in cloud computing nor assessed any  of the long-term financial figures and statistics of the relevant market. This is particularly the  case for financial data on supplier and end-user market activities and market development  statistics; such data include past, present and forthcoming market-value information on  suppliers and end users. The collection of such economic figures is a long-term activity,  requiring qualitative, long-term data collection. Such activities go beyond our scope, resource  availability and planning horizon. There are certainly other activities/organisations that are better  suited to perform such long-term tasks, both outside (6) (7) and within ENISA (8).  1.2.  INFORMATION ON PERFORMED DATA COLLECTION  Through ENISA stakeholder consultations and past experience with market analysis, it has  been decided to perform primary research for the cloud cybersecurity market analysis. For this  purpose, a survey has been generated, supported by the ENISA Ad Hoc Working Group on  Cybersecurity Market Analysis and external experts. The survey was divided in questions  targeting the various stakeholders of the cloud ecosystem. The survey consisted of around 100  in questions total, for all cloud stakeholder types (i.e. supply, demand, R & D and bodies  involved in regulation). As survey tool, the EUSurvey (9) platform has been used. The survey is  anonymous. No data about the responders has been collected, therefore tracing back the  responders is impossible.  Through an ENISA announcement, 230 stakeholders interested in participating in the survey  have been identified (pre-registered). Among those, there were also associations of cloud  suppliers and cloud users, but also cloud computing consortia.

This included mainly data sanity checks, such as plausibility and data consistency checks. The  data set that went into the analysis is considered as a whole to be representative thanks to:  - a good mix of large and smaller organisations, both on the supply and demand sides;  - good coverage of EU Member States;  - good coverage of R & D organisations conducting cloud-related research; and  - good coverage of EU regulatory bodies engaging in cloud regulation.  The quantitative data obtained through the survey have been validated by means of additional  qualitative data obtained through desktop research: the analysed results and conclusions made  were compared with findings from publicly available information to examine in more depth their  validity. As an additional validation step, the analysis and the final conclusion was reviewed by  various subject-matter experts, such as contracted external experts and members of the ENISA  Ad Hoc Working Group on Cybersecurity Market Analysis.  All in all, the survey had a positive outcome for ENISA, in particular to gain further experience in  terms of scoping and structuring a cyber security market survey, market stakeholder  mobilisation and data sanity and data validation.  The second deliverable in 2 years’ time, this analysis helped ENISA to increase its maturity level  in the performance of cybersecurity market analysis tasks, with the advantage of being in the  position to transfer collected knowledge to external and internal ENISA stakeholders alike.  1.3.  STRUCTURE OF THIS REPORT  The report has been structured so as to contain the highlights of the performed cloud  cybersecurity market analysis. Its sections contain the most important findings from the  performed survey and comprise a synthetic view based on the collected evidence. With the  presented material, we seek to cover the information needs of the main target group of the  report, this being all stakeholder types of the cloud ecosystem (see also Section 2.1.1), thus  covering the information needs of supply, demand, regulatory bodies and R & D organisations.  It is assumed that with this information at hand, the needs of Member States, the European  Commission and EU institutions, bodies and agencies will also be covered, as they will be in the  position to satisfy their information needs by taking into account the presented results in all  kinds of oversight, guidance and regulatory activities. Should some of these external  stakeholders wish to have access to the anonymous raw data collected, they can contact  ENISA to submit their request (see contact information at the beginning of this report).  Moreover, the generated results will be of value to ENISA’s internal stakeholders. For example,  various ENISA activities in the areas of certification, cybersecurity index, research and  innovation, cybersecurity investments, cyberthreat analysis, vulnerability management, etc.,  may use both these results, but also raw data of the performed survey for their own purposes.  It is worth mentioning that the structure of this report has already been validated by ENISA  stakeholders, such as the ENISA Advisory Group and the National Liaison Officers Network,  and ENISA-internal groups working in areas overlapping with the contents addressed in this  analysis.  The structure of this report is as follows.

CLOUD CYBERSECURITY MARKET ANALYSIS  Final | 1.0 | Public | March 2023  14  2. CHARACTERISTICS OF THE  CLOUD CYBERSECURITY  ECOSYSTEM  When analysing the cloud computing cybersecurity market, it is necessary to envisage/assess  various building blocks of cloud computing, such as infrastructure components, models,  activities, characteristics, capabilities and service architecture. These cloud computing  elements (10) will be impacted by any materialised threat, deliberate or accidental, causing  potential damage to hosted data and services.  In this section, we present all relevant elements of cloud computing that are considered as the  main assets of cloud computing infrastructure. Existing standards regarding the cloud  computing infrastructure components, cloud models and service provisioning have been  considered for this discussion (11). Moreover, numerous publications do exist, consolidating  cybersecurity issues in cloud computing environments. Based on this material, a summary of  various cloud computing assets is provided in the discussion below. Related threat-assessment  reports/documents indicate methods on how they can be targeted and which cybersecurity  issues have been encountered.  In the context of a cybersecurity market analysis, the role of the presented material is to set the  scene for the relationship between cybersecurity and cloud computing.  Companies in cybersecurity market segments, for example, relate to cloud computing in several  ways, such as by providing security from the cloud (the ‘security as a service’ (SECaaS)  business model), providing security for the cloud computing infrastructure (e.g. secure stack  components) or providing security in the cloud (e.g. confidentiality of data in the cloud).  Similarly, companies from the cloud computing market segment, which could be hyperscalers  offering public cloud services, independent software vendors or even other enablers (managed  cloud, brokers etc.), increasingly offer various cybersecurity security products and services as  well.  This makes market segmentation and value-chain issues in cloud computing security highly  dynamic and volatile, with convergence and interference of cybersecurity and cloud computing  elements being an important part of the context for this report.  With this material in mind, survey questions were formulated to cover both demand and supply  perceptions on:  - the overall structure of cloud computing infrastructure, related ecosystem and elements,  including service provisioning and relevant cloud computing stakeholders;  - available cloud and cybersecurity services,  - common cloud computing and service threats;  - cybersecurity challenges in the cloud computing ecosystem; and  (10)  The word ‘elements’ is used as a synonym of ‘cloud computing building blocks’. Moreover, assets are  considered cloud elements that are critical for the user of the service and/or for the operator of the cloud  computing infrastructure, thus being valuable for the end-to-end service provisioning and/or for the  business process they implement.  (11)  E.g. https://www.iso.org/committee/601355.html#, accessed April 2022.  https://www.iso.org/committee/601355.html  CLOUD CYBERSECURITY MARKET ANALYSIS  Final | 1.0 | Public | March 2023  15  - cybersecurity controls, technologies and solutions, deployed to deal with threats and  challenges in cloud computing.  It must also be noted that most of the collected material reflect the status of cloud computing as  it has evolved in the last years, but it is limited in that it has to present a rather a static view on  cloud computing.  The development and adoption of emerging technologies, such as the Internet of Things (IoT),  5G and AI, but also the pace of digital transformation, has contributed to an even faster  evolution and adoption of cloud computing technology. Edge computing (12) / fog computing (13)  and cloud continuum (14), are examples of the transformation of cloud computing. Within this  analysis, the dynamic part is captured by means of an assessment of cloud innovation trends.  The analysis targets ecosystem perspectives through a number of stakeholder views (see also  Section 2.1.1). On the demand side, these are mainly stakeholders who already have (or wish  to establish) a contractual relationship with a CSP and use cloud security products or services,  either from the same CSP or from another supply-side stakeholder (cloud enabler, independent  software vendor, etc.). Regarding the supply side, these are either stakeholders directly  providing cloud computing and cloud security services or enablers adding some value to the  cloud service provided by the CSP (i.e. cybersecurity product or services, managed detection  and response, consulting, etc.).  2.1.  CLOUD ECOSYSTEM  The cloud ecosystem is understood as mix of technology, operational and organisational  entities that make up the entire service provisioning chain and cover both supply and demand.  The cloud ecosystem consists of different cloud service categories, cloud deployment models,  cloud capability types and cybersecurity-related services, functions and capabilities. Roles and  relationships between stakeholders on the supply and demand sides are the most important  part to define an ecosystem, together with specific resources, requirements and issues for  certain organisations or users. While cloud computing roles and associated activities and  responsibilities are standardised (15) (16), the relationship with cybersecurity might not clearly  taken into account in these definitions. To give an example, a managed cybersecurity service  operator (e.g. managed detection and response) might need access to cloud computing  network traffic or log files on behalf of its client, but it might not be considered as a ‘cloud  service partner’ as defined by ISO (17).  In this section, the various cloud ecosystem elements that are important for this analysis are  briefly presented. They make up the basis of this analysis and were an integral part of the  survey.  As regards the cloud infrastructure, four infrastructure levels are considered. The cloud  infrastructure levels are related to cybersecurity, both within cybersecurity products and services  (see Section 2.3) and by means of threats targeting those infrastructure levels (see Section  2.5). These levels are:  • the data level, representing the data household of cloud computing, with both stored data  and data in transit;  • the application level, representing installed applications using the cloud computing  resources (hardware and software);  (12)  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edge_computing, accessed May 2022.

Cloud Computing Stakeholder Types  While multiple stakeholders may be part of the cloud computing ecosystem, for the sake of this  market analysis, we will only consider the main stakeholder types described below (see Table  3). It is worth mentioning that organisations may play multiple roles in the cloud ecosystems. For  example, a research institution can concurrently act as a cloud user, an enabler can consume  cloud services for its own need, and a regulator can subscribe to a cloud service.  The roles presented below are the main ones mentioned in various publications on cloud  computing. Nonetheless, they present a rather static view, as opposed to the dynamic nature of  the cloud ecosystem, where various other roles may emerge and existing ones may overlap or  evolve. The choice of this rather static approach is due to the purpose of grouping questions of  this survey accordingly.  In the survey underlying this analysis, stakeholders invited to participate in the survey may refer  to the various roles they may hold in the cloud ecosystem. For each role, they will be asked to  answer the corresponding survey questions dedicated to that role. In this way, we aim at  covering the maximum scope of their activities in the cloud ecosystem.  Table 3: Main cloud stakeholder types considered for the purpose of the present market  analysis  Stakeholder  type Description Examples  Supply side:  CSPs  Owners and operators of cloud computing systems  offering public, private, hybrid and community  cloud services. They are responsible for end-to- end service provisioning, including maintenance,  protection and infrastructure upgrades. They may  include various service providers in their service  provisioning supply chain.  Microsoft, Google, Amazon  (all models: software as a  service (SaaS), platform as  a service (PaaS) and  infrastructure as a service  (IaaS), Oracle, SAP,  Salesforce (for SaaS,  PaaS).  Supply side:  enablers  Enablers are intermediates between end users  and public-service platform providers and/or  private cloud computing. They facilitate the  adoption of cloud services by, for example:  • packaging services;  • providing added-value services on top of  services offered by service platform providers;  • operating the private cloud for customers;  • providing multi-cloud solutions.  Enabler examples include cloud brokers,  integrators, consultants, developers, outsourcers,  application hosting, etc. Their offerings add value  to CSPs (see above) and/or operators/managers  of private cloud platforms.  ATOS, Cap Gemini,  Accenture, Deloitte, PwC,  KPMG etc.  CLOUD CYBERSECURITY MARKET ANALYSIS  Final | 1.0 | Public | March 2023  17  Stakeholder  type Description Examples  Demand side:  end users,  consumers  Both current and prospective subscribers of cloud  computing services, at all levels of their business  processes (including infrastructure providers  integrating cloud services within their  infrastructure, e.g. 5G operators, financial  institutions, IoT service providers, etc.).  All kinds of subscribers –  both private and  commercial – irrespectively  of size and business  needs.  Entities  involved in  regulatory work  National or international entities / public authorities  / institutions that – directly or indirectly – exert  regulatory influence on cloud services.  European Commission,  regulators of Member  States, data protection  authorities, associations,  etc.  R & D Public and private organisations performing  research on cloud technology, cloud services,  cloud operations, cloud functions, usage models,  etc.  Universities, research  institutions.  Note: Throughout this cloud cybersecurity market analysis, we have not discriminated between  cloud service providers and enablers. Instead, we have merged these two types under the  stakeholder type ‘supply side’. Although this differentiation would be significant to capture the  market role of these two stakeholder types, there is still a certain ‘blurriness’ in the market  regarding these types. In many cases, cybersecurity services are integrated in typical CSP  offerings. On the other hand, enablers often act as resellers of typical cloud services, while  providing value-added cybersecurity services. This fact introduces a certain ‘blurriness’ in the  market. Besides this, the merge was also done in order to simplify the dissemination to  organisations that are active in supplying cloud services and in order to avoid confusion on the  part of the participating organisations.  2.2.  CLOUD MODELS AND ATTRIBUTES  As defined in relevant standards (18), the cloud paradigm consists of five essential attributes,  three service delivery models and four deployment models. Their relationship with cybersecurity  is documented in different standards (19) (20) and other reports. Understanding the ecosystem  and division of responsibility is essential in order to understand the market context, with so  many vendors, platforms, tools and services that fall under the IaaS, PaaS and SaaS  categories, sometimes overlapping, as well as the fast evolution of deployment models. While  responsibility used to be more statically assigned in the past, these days it is more appropriate  to talk about the sliding scale of security responsibilities in the cloud. Figure 1 provides an  overview of this.  (18)  https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3417/11/19/9005/pdf, accessed April 2022.  (19)  https://www.iso.org/standard/67545.html, accessed November 2022.  (20)  https://www.iso.org/standard/43757.html, accessed November 2022.  https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3417/11/19/9005/pdf https://www.iso.org/standard/67545.html https://www.iso.org/standard/43757.html  CLOUD CYBERSECURITY MARKET ANALYSIS  Final | 1.0 | Public | March 2023  18  Figure 1: Cloud computing attributes and models  The contents of the cloud computing models and attributes are described in the following  sections.  2.2.1.  Service Models  The service models consist three main use-cases of cloud infrastructures. Depending on the  service model used, the responsibilities for the operation and maintenance of the corresponding  computing layers/functions are attributed either to the service provider or the end user. The  following computing functions are considered: application, data, runtime, middleware, operating  system, virtualisation and hardware.  • ‘Software as a service’ (SaaS) model. The user of the service can access applications  hosted by a service provider on a network. Users of this service can directly use the desired  application. I many cases, this model is associated with a pay-as-you-go policy, and easy  access to the application via a browser is often implemented. In this service model, the  provider is responsible for maintaining all hosted computing functions: applications, data,  runtime, middleware, operating system, virtualisation and hardware. In this model, the  provider is responsible for the cybersecurity of the entire service, covering the entire set of  hosted components.  • ‘Platform as a service’ (PaaS) model. While the user of an application is responsible for  its installation, maintenance and data management, the provider delivers all other  computing functions, such as runtime, middleware, operating system, virtualisation and  hardware. PaaS often delivers software-development tools and various programming  languages, allowing users to develop their own software.  • ‘Infrastructure as a service’ (IaaS) model. In this model, the service provider delivers  resources to the user hardware as a single tenant, often on the basis of a pay-per-use  policy. This allows users of the service to minimise high initial hardware investments.  CLOUD CYBERSECURITY MARKET ANALYSIS  Final | 1.0 | Public | March 2023  19  Moreover, service providers are in the position to respond to changing performance  requirements in a quick and cost-effective manner.  2.2.2.  Deployment Models  Deployment models are the initial choice of cloud users regarding the desired model for sharing,  access and ownership of the available computing resources. Deployment models determine the  number and nature of tenants using a shared cloud computing resource. Deployment models  include the public cloud, private cloud, community cloud and hybrid cloud.  • Public cloud. This deployment model – often referred to as an external cloud – is open to  a large number of users who can access it via the internet. The access to the cloud  resources is managed by the CSP, who also carries the responsibility of maintaining the  operation of the service, according to the selected service model.  • Private cloud. This deployment model is dedicated to the use of the available cloud  computing resources by a single tenant (i.e. by a user, group or institution). This  deployment model is a more secure but more expensive option. It can be operated either  by the CSP or by any other third party, both on-site and off-site.  • Community cloud. This deployment model is dedicated to groups of users/communities  that share the same type of requirements (i.e. security, privacy, compliance, policies, etc.).  It can be managed by members of the community or any other third party, including the  CSP.  • Hybrid cloud. This deployment model represents a mix of two or more of the above  deployment models. By mixing these deployment models, users might aim at having a  more restrictive policy for parts of their infrastructure (e.g. data management), while other  parts (e.g. applications) may be used by means of a shared model.  • Multi-cloud. Multi-cloud is a cloud environment that integrates various deployment models  (just as the hybrid cloud does). The difference with the hybrid cloud is that a mixed cloud  also integrates various instances of the same deployment model types into a single logical  cloud infrastructure. Issues of compatibility of data and applications are essential in this  regard.  Although multi-cloud is considered as a distinct deployment model (21) (22), within this analysis it  is not considered as an additional option, as it is considered to be covered by the  abovementioned ‘hybrid cloud’ option.  2.2.3.  Cloud Essential Attributes  Cloud essential attributes represent the means for provisioning the various cloud computing  models mentioned above, with the aim to offer users differentiated pricing methods. These  attributes apply to each of the above models and provide various means of flexibility for the  pricing options of the used services.  • On-demand self-service (pay-as-you-use). The user will be in the position to pay per  usage, thus reducing costs according to their needs. This pricing model is imposed  automatically by the service provider, without any human intervention.  • Broad network access. Available cloud services can be offered via the network through  (thick) client platforms and through a number of devices, such as laptops, workstations and  mobile devices.  • Resource pooling (multi-tenant). Multiple users participating in a multi-tenant model can  use pooled resources – both physical and virtual – according to their demand.  • Rapid elasticity. Available cloud resources can be released in a rapid manner, scaled  according to user requests/requirements. Requested resources can be allocated at any  time and in any quantity.

Cloud services can automatically control resource utilisation by  automatically measuring the level of usage (e.g. number of users, amount of processing,  network bandwidth). This is done for optimisation purposes and also increases  transparency of usage for both users and providers.  2.3.  CYBERSECURITY PRODUCTS AND SERVICES RELATED TO CLOUD  COMPUTING  Consolidating the information on the cloud computing ecosystem, models and attributes  mentioned so far, but also that on other existing information on cloud based service offerings,  this section provides a non-exhaustive list of products and services developed to cover  cybersecurity requirements and the needs of both supply and demand – from the cloud, in the  cloud and for the cloud. This information is presented in a tabular form, breaking down the  various cybersecurity services and functions (considered as value-added services on top of  those cybersecurity features and services already available or provided by CSPs), in a similar  manner as the ECSMAF (23) (see Table 4).

CLOUD COMPUTING CYBERSECURITY CHALLENGES  In this section, some security challenges are presented. They constitute a list of cybersecurity  concerns that are relevant for the majority of cloud computing stakeholder types (i.e. supply,  demand and regulatory bodies). Though not completely overlap-free, these challenges are  indicative of the necessity to protect cloud resources on the basis of the assumption that cloud  computing is – now and within the foreseeable future – a growing industry and a central facility  for the processing of company data. Cybersecurity challenges will be used within the present  analysis to capture the concerns of demand, supply and regulatory bodies. The cybersecurity  challenges summarised below (in alphabetical order) have been found in various publications  related to cybersecurity in cloud computing (24) (25).  • Access control. Access-control challenges emerge through the difficulty of implementing  a distributed access-control architecture embracing all distributed access of the –  eventually distributed – organisation. The need for asynchronous interactions in a  decentralised, distributed environment may pose additional challenges to the technical  implementation of a coherent access-control policy.  • Audit. Such challenges emerge from the complexity of audit actions aiming to regularly  monitor performance and compliance within end-to-end cloud service delivery.  • Authorisation. These challenges emerge through errors/misconfigurations in tools for  authorisation management and for accessibility of cloud computing resources (i.e.  applications, data and network).  • Availability. Availability challenges emerge for users and service providers alike. Users  need to develop proper strategies (26) by properly configuring available cloud resources to  obtain application and data availability. On the other hand, availability offered by CSPs has  been traditionally limited to local installations of hardware and software resources. With the  inclusion of multiple players in the cloud computing infrastructures and supply chain, the  achievement of an overall end-to-end availability of services requires large orchestration  across a number of organisations and infrastructures.  • Chain of trust / chain of responsibility. These are challenges related to the  maintenance of coherent account control and accountability control throughout an  organisation (i.e. multi-cloud and local processing) in accordance with enterprise policies.  • Compliance. These challenges are related to the compliance of cloud services regarding  international, national and sectorial requirements, especially regarding the confidentiality  and privacy of processed information, but also the governance of services. Depending on  geographies of business activities, for a single organisation, multiple compliance  requirements may be applicable. This adds an additional level of complexity in mastering  compliance challenges.  • Confidentiality. Confidentiality challenges emerge in the cloud mainly at the data and  network levels. At the data level, confidentiality challenges are related to the disclosure of  user data to unauthorised entities, which is mainly an effect of misconfiguration,  malfunctioning or discoordination of access rights. At the network level, confidentiality  breaches occur when network content is captured by attackers, particularly in multi-tenant  environments.  • Cybersecurity incident management. These challenges are related to the ability to  recognise, analyse and respond to incidents related to various valuable assets offered to  users via a cloud service (i.e. applications, data and cloud infrastructure elements).  • Identification and authentication. Identification and authentication challenges may  emerge through difficulties in the coordination of identity managements in both cloud and  internal systems.

Integrity challenges in the cloud environment may emerge regarding data,  network and insecure application programming interfaces (APIs). Data integrity challenges  exist due to data storage in multiple locations. Network integrity challenges are due to the  reuse of IP addresses and the corruption of routing information, both leading to information  leakages. At the level of insecure APIs, integrity challenges emerge through violations of  access control and authentication, leading to loss of data.  • Multi-tenancy. These challenges emerge from multi-tenancy, especially regarding data  loss, loss of confidentiality and availability. Such challenges may arise when virtual  machines / hypervisors are successfully attacked and the adversary gets access to all  available tenants.  • Network security. Challenges in network security emerge through the complexity of  network connections to be managed in a distributed virtualised environment. In contrast to  traditional networks where the entry and exit points are fixed, in cloud a number of  dynamically configured network access points need to be managed (e.g. network traffic  analysis). Managing the network in a virtualised environment is a far more complex,  leaving space for misconfigurations that offer attack surface.  • Privacy. Privacy challenges emerge from the necessity to impose an organisation-wide  privacy policy in a highly distributed, decentralised and virtualised environment. Diversity  of privacy regulations in various geographies adds an additional level of difficulty to master  privacy challenges.  • Storage. These challenges are related to secure storage, compatibility of data among  various platforms, potential data losses, assurance of physical location of stored data in  virtual environments (i.e. within the various deployment models).  • Transparency/visibility/nonrepudiation. These are challenges stemming from the  absence of visibility and transparency in the use of cloud services (applications, data,  APIs, etc. – see also threats 10 and 11 in Section 2.5).  2.5.  THREAT EXPOSURE OF CLOUD COMPUTING  Cloud infrastructures and cloud services are exposed to a number of cyberthreats. For the  current analysis, we will consider the threats assessed through Cloud Security Alliance (27) (i.e.  the ‘Egregious Eleven’) (28). These threats represent the exposure of cloud computing  infrastructure levels and functions. Ideally, existing cybersecurity measures will reduce the  attack surface, thus reducing exposure to these threats.  1. Data breaches (29) (30). Through unauthorised access, protected information can be  manipulated, deleted, released or stolen. The reasons of such an incident can be manifold,  including human error, misconfiguration, malicious attack, negligence, etc. Mostly, a data  breach is a consequence of a successful attack from inside or outside the organisation.  2. Abuse of misconfigurations and inadequate change control. Errors in the  configuration of IT components and/or inadequate management of software is a weakness  that can be abused by adversaries. Such weaknesses may be detected by attackers and  can be exploited through attacks to related IT components.  3. Lack of cloud security architecture and strategy. A smooth transition to cloud based  services needs to go hand in hand with a plan for the expansion of the cybersecurity  (27)  https://cloudsecurityalliance.org/artifacts/top-threats-egregious-11-deep-dive, accessed February  2023.  (28)  Some of the egregious eleven are rather weaknesses/vulnerabilities, for example insecure interfaces  and APIs. In order to overcome this, for the sake of this analysis some modifications have been made  in the titles of these threats. These additions are annotated through italics. Moreover, some of the  egregious eleven indicated as ‘security issues’ are rather ‘actions on objectives’ (according to the cyber  kill chain), for example the nefarious use of cloud services.  (29)  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/enisa-threat-landscape-2020-data-breach, accessed April  2022.  (30)  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_breach, accessed May 2022.  https://cloudsecurityalliance.org/artifacts/top-threats-egregious-11-deep-dive https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/enisa-threat-landscape-2020-data-breach https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_breach  CLOUD CYBERSECURITY MARKET ANALYSIS  Final | 1.0 | Public | March 2023  24  perimeter. Uncoordinated/unplanned adoption of cloud services may otherwise create  gaps in cybersecurity protection and thus increase exposure to cyberthreats.  4. Abuse of insufficient identity, credential, access and key management. The  deployment of cloud services brings new IAM challenges. The introduction of the  necessary cloud credentials and their management needs to be coherent with the identity  management policies applied in the internal IT. The coordination of both access  managements (cloud and internal) has to be planned (see previous threat), configured and  managed (see also threat 2). This will reduce exposure to the threat of abuse of (weak)  cloud identification and access management functions.  5. Account hijacking (31). This threat indicates the effect of threat materialisation leading to  the take-over of an account (e-mail, computer, web, etc.) by an adversary. An account  hijacking is the entry point of a series of abuses and attacks related to confidential user  data and available functions. Examples of attacks following an account hijacking are  phishing, fraud, exploitation of available functions and abuse of vulnerabilities.  6. Insider threat (32). An insider threat is an action that may result in an incident, performed  by someone or a group of people affiliated with or working for the potential victim. There  are several patterns associated with threats from the inside. A well-known insider threat  pattern (also known as ‘privilege misuse’) occurs when outsiders collaborate with internal  actors to gain unapproved access to assets. Moreover, insiders may cause harm  unintentionally through carelessness or because of a lack of knowledge.  7. Abuse of insecure interfaces and APIs. Cloud services are offered to consumers via a  series of APIs. Moreover, APIs are used within components of the cloud to enable  functions among all layers of the cloud infrastructure. When adversaries gain access to  these APIs, they can cause significant damage, to both cloud users and CSPs (e.g.  manipulations, eavesdropping, data exfiltration).  8. Abuse of weak control plane. Being the main control tool for data management (e.g.  data storage, data migration, data duplication), the control plane plays an important role in  maintaining data security in the cloud. Given the complexity of configuring cloud services,  especially multi-cloud environments, a control plane that lacks coherence with overall  security policy and IT architecture may introduce cybersecurity weaknesses. When  abused, such weaknesses may lead to massive data losses.  9. Metastructure and applistructure failures. For the managing of cloud services through  customers, a series of interfaces (user interfaces and APIs) are offered by the CSP. These  interfaces offer security and protection functions with the aim to be used by cloud users  (i.e. user applications and user control plane). These interfaces reveal important  information about security and protective measures to users of the service. Failures,  weakness, improper use or misuse of these interfaces may introduce significant risks to  the entire infrastructure.  10. Abuse of limited cloud usage visibility. Organisations may not be in the position to fully  track the use of cloud applications and services, irrespectively of the origin of the user  (internal or external). Due to a potentially low visibility of the use of cloud applications,  attackers may gain malicious access to available application interfaces and unnoticeably  use computing resources, manipulate data and perform data exfiltration.  11. Abuse and nefarious use of cloud services. As a result of a successful attack,  adversaries may be in the position to gain access to cloud resources and use them for  malicious activities requiring significant resources, such as denial-of-service attacks,  cryptomining, brute force attacks and massive phishing attacks. Moreover, cloud  resources may be used to hide/store malicious content such as malware and stolen data.  (31)  https://www.techopedia.com/definition/24632/account-hijacking, accessed May 2022.

DEMOGRAPHICS OF  INVOLVED STAKEHOLDER  TYPES  In accordance with the identified cloud stakeholder types, the analysis of the cloud security  market focuses on cloud security users (i.e. demand) and CSPs. The assessment of the cloud  security ecosystem to advance our understanding of the state of play, trends, threats and  opportunities for future secure development requires a complete understanding of all the key  stakeholder types that may influence these elements, including regulatory bodies intervening in  shaping the market and the R & D initiatives on cloud security.  In this chapter, the general characteristics of the surveyed organisations are presented. They  mainly consist of information on sizes, geographies covered by the surveyed organisations and  the sectors of their activities.  3.1. DEMAND SIDE: THE PROFILE OF CLOUD USERS  To analyse the profile of organisations that have adopted cloud systems, the report sorts the  respondents by size (see Figure 2). Large multinational companies (5 000 employees or more)  represent 33 % of the sample, followed by medium-sized enterprises (50 to 249 employees, 27  % of the sample). Large enterprises (250 to 5 000 employees) and micro companies (less than  10 employees) each represents 20 % of the sample, making up 40 % of the sample.  As regards the cloud usage of the demand side, our hypothesis is that smaller organisations will  make more use of SECaaS providers, while large organisations will have more complex  deployment and cloud usage patterns, which in turn will reveal more demand for innovative  cybersecurity products and services from this customer segment.  Figure 2: Size of demand-side organisations (based on number of employees)  As we can see in Figure 3, which depicts the geographical distribution of survey responders,  most of the respondents are located in the Europe, Middle East and Africa region (the EMEA  region), while the remaining 20 % are divided between North and Latin America.  CLOUD CYBERSECURITY MARKET ANALYSIS  Final | 1.0 | Public | March 2023  26  Within the EMEA region, there are no respondents based in Africa. In contrast, several operate  in EU Member States (Figure 3), mainly in Belgium, Germany and the Netherlands, followed by  the Czechia, Ireland, France, Italy, Portugal, Romania, Slovenia, Slovakia, and Sweden.  Figure 3: Geographical distribution of surveyed demand-side organisations  As we can see in Figure 4, , which depicts the engagement of the demand-side in various  sectors, about 40 % of cloud security users are involved in two industries: in banking and  securities and in communications, media and services (33) (each representing 20 % of the  sample). In addition, the government, healthcare, insurance and transportation industries each  represent 7 % of the mapped market. 33 % of user companies operate in other sectors, such as  cybersecurity consulting, technology consulting, ICT, food and beverages, and services  industries.  (33)  It is worth noting that the communication and media industry embraces Telecommunications. reason why this group is so  prominent among survey responders.  CLOUD CYBERSECURITY MARKET ANALYSIS  Final | 1.0 | Public | March 2023  27  Figure 4: Sectors of activity of the surveyed demand-side organisations  3.2.  SUPPLY SIDE: THE PROFILE OF CLOUD PROVIDERS  The cloud-security providers that responded to the survey are mainly multinational companies  (5 000 employees or more, 36 % of the total), followed by medium-sized enterprises (50 to 249  employees, 27 %). Large enterprises (250 to 5 000 employees) and micro companies (less than  ten employees) comprise 18 % of the sample (34). Most of them are located in several  geographical areas besides the EU.  More than 80 % have a physical presence in the EMEA region, 60–80 % are also in the Asia– Pacific region (APAC) or North America, and 20–40 % also have an office in Latin America  (Figure 5). If we focus only on the EU Member States (Figure 5), 60–80 % of interviewed  companies are present in France, while 40–60 % have offices in Germany, Spain, Italy,  Portugal and the Netherlands. Between 20 % and 40 % of companies are in Czechia, Denmark,  Ireland, Greece, Croatia, Hungary the Netherlands, Austria, Poland, Romania, Finland and  Sweden. Less than 20 % also have offices in Bulgaria, Estonia, Cyprus, Slovenia and Slovakia.  Figure 5 shows the geographical distribution of the surveyed cloud suppliers.  (34)  It should be noted that the definitions of company sizes comply with the EU definitions (see https://single-market-  economy.ec.europa.eu/smes/sme-definition_en).  https://single-market-economy.ec.europa.eu/smes/sme-definition_en https://single-market-economy.ec.europa.eu/smes/sme-definition_en  CLOUD CYBERSECURITY MARKET ANALYSIS  Final | 1.0 | Public | March 2023  28  Figure 5: Physical presence of cloud service suppliers  A large percentage (55 %) of the suppliers that responded to the survey only serve EMEA  clients; within the EU Member States, suppliers report serving customers mainly in France,  Belgium (64 %), Germany, Spain, Italy, and Portugal (55 %) (Figure 6). However, 36 % of  suppliers count clients not only in EMEA but also in Latin America, North America and notably  APAC; the remaining 9 % focuses only on the EMEA and APAC markets. The collected data  about the geographical presence of cloud customers in the EU can be found in Figure 6.  CLOUD CYBERSECURITY MARKET ANALYSIS  Final | 1.0 | Public | March 2023  29  Figure 6: Countries of origin of cloud customers of the surveyed cloud suppliers  Their customers operate in the healthcare and banking and securities industries (82 % of  suppliers work for them), followed by utilities, transportation, retail, manufacturing and natural  resources, government and communication, media and services (64 % of suppliers), insurance  (55 %) and education (45 %). Only (27 %) have customers in the wholesale trade sector (see  Figure 7).  CLOUD CYBERSECURITY MARKET ANALYSIS  Final | 1.0 | Public | March 2023  30  Figure 7: Sectors of activity of cloud-supplier customers  3.3.  REGULATORY BODIES  The appreciation of the role regulatory bodies as an important stakeholder type in the cloud  ecosystem is an important element of this analysis. It complements the existing analyses by  assessing the actors’ role and positioning in shaping the context of the cloud security market  and its evolution.  Most of the respondents of this survey (88 % of the sample organisations) take a direct  approach by actively/directly participating in the development, enforcing and promoting of new  regulations in cloud cybersecurity, by paying particular attention to the core sectors of this  market (see Figure 8 and Figure 9).  Figure 8: Role of regulatory bodies in cloud-related regulation  Regulatory activities mainly target the public sector, highly regulated industries and critical  infrastructure-related industries (see Figure 9). The significant majority of regulators focus on  government (targeted by 75 % of the involved organisations); communication, media and  CLOUD CYBERSECURITY MARKET ANALYSIS  Final | 1.0 | Public | March 2023  31  services (62 %); banking and security and utilities (50 %); education, manufacturing and natural  resources; transportation (38 %); insurance and healthcare providers (25 %); and lastly retail  and wholesale trade (12 %).  Figure 9: Sectors targeted by regulatory activities  3.4.  RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ORGANISATIONS  Understanding the focus of investments in R & D is essential to foresee the trajectory of cloud  cybersecurity as R & D may shape the market evolution and its potential opportunities and  threats. The respondents of the survey state that their R & D initiatives mainly focus on the  following sectors: banking and securities; education; government; wholesale trade;  transportation and other sectors, such as technology services, aerospace and military  implications.  A smaller percentage of initiatives (17 %) focuses on utilities, retail, manufacturing and natural  resources; insurance; healthcare providers; and communication, media and services (a sector  including telecommunications).  3.5.  INTERESTING OBSERVATIONS: CLOUD DEMOGRAPHICS  1. Regulated sectors assessed do not comply to most frequent sectors of cloud supply and  demand. Although this may be due to the forward-looking nature of regulation, it might be  interesting to investigate how regulators interact with existing cloud use-cases in various  sectors and how this shapes their regulatory activities.  2. Data about providers’ location and customers’ location may suggest implications for  policymakers – i.e. capacity to interpret privacy/security regulation, etc.  3. It seems as though R & D is not taking care of sectors that use cloud services the most.  This either means that there are limited research needs in those sectors, or that R & D  tends to conduct research on special requirements in a sector-independent manner.  4. Stakeholders that have been involved in this survey are engaged in cloud computing  cybersecurity in several ways, such as: i) providing security from the cloud (SECaaS  business model), ii) providing security for the cloud computing infrastructure e.g. secure  CLOUD CYBERSECURITY MARKET ANALYSIS  Final | 1.0 | Public | March 2023  32  stack components, and iii) providing security in the cloud, for example confidentiality of data  in the cloud. We have a well-balanced split between different types and sizes of demand- side stakeholders (users). Smaller demand-side organisations use SECaaS providers, a  sub-segment of SaaS model, more frequently. Large organisations have more complex  cloud usage patterns, which in turn reveals more demand for innovative cybersecurity  products and services from this customer segments.  5. Many CSPs are also cloud security providers (for example, SECaaS is frequently  considered as a sub-segment of the SaaS market) and a portion of supply-side  stakeholders only provides cybersecurity products and services (see also ‘Supply-side  enablers’ in the definitions of cloud stakeholder types in Section 2.1.1).  CLOUD CYBERSECURITY MARKET ANALYSIS  Final | 1.0 | Public | March 2023  33  4. CLOUD USAGE PATTERNS  AND REQUIREMENTS  4.1.  CLOUD USAGE PATTERNS  The characterisation of cloud adoption and cloud usage depends on the following elements (see  also Section 2.1.1):  • the service model used (IaaS, PaaS, SaaS);  • the deployment model (public cloud, private cloud, multi-cloud, community cloud or  hybrid cloud) indicating the preferred access model of the provided services; and  • the cloud attributes indicating the most appropriate/efficient provisioning model to use  the cloud services.  In terms of the most widely used cloud service model (see Figure 10), according to both the  demand (87 % of sampled companies) and supply (82 %) sides, there is a clear preference for  the SaaS cloud service model. However, interestingly, 67 % of customers also use cloud  through the use the PaaS model, which is offered by only 45 % of providers. These results may  therefore be indicative of a potential market niche, as demand seems to show a preference for  the PaaS cloud service model. We also note that there is a higher concentration of suppliers  (limited supply) in the PaaS cloud service model segment. On the supply side, PaaS is mainly  used by application developers, for which PaaS helps to simplify development and deployment.  It was traditionally also the least important service model in terms of revenue, as not every  organisation has internal developers.  However, PaaS offerings became more widely adopted with the support of micro-service  architectures. Advanced application functionalities, supporting big data, AI, machine-learning  capabilities or the IoT may further drive adoption of PaaS services, and this segment could be  an opportunity for the emerging cloud providers.  Figure 10: Cloud service model, a comparison of perceptions of supply and demand sides  A market imbalance is also clearly visible in terms of deployment models (see Figure 11).  Indeed, even though supply and demand are aligned on the preference for public services  (used by 80 % of customers and offered by 82 % of sellers), the demand for the other services  is much lower than the reported offer, with the highest gap between private cloud demand (40  %) and supply (82 %). This imbalance may suggest that providers are already building capacity  CLOUD CYBERSECURITY MARKET ANALYSIS  Final | 1.0 | Public | March 2023  34  in preparation for a future differentiation in the market or that customers prefer these  deployment models in areas not included in the demand sample (e.g. APAC).  In regards to private cloud services, an adoption of 40 % is in line with the type of demand-side  respondents: private cloud services are usually contracted by larger users, which form about 50  % of the respondents of this study (see Figure 2).  Figure 11: Cloud deployment model, a comparison of perceptions of supply and demand  Results on main cloud attributes confirm a somewhat misaligned situation between demand- reported use and supply offering (Figure 12). Indeed, both parties agree that on-demand self- service (pay-as-you-use) is the most critical characteristic of a successful cloud service.  However, suppliers’ evaluation does not match the relevance that customers given to other  attributes, such as rapid elasticity, broad network access and resource pooling. The opposite is  true regarding measured service and other attributes, such as specialised compliance services.  CLOUD CYBERSECURITY MARKET ANALYSIS  Final | 1.0 | Public | March 2023  35  Figure 12: Cloud attributes, a comparison of perceptions of supply and demand  In the context of cloud security, the relationship and shared responsibility between customer  and CSP is essential. The customer is responsible for securing how they use the cloud services,  including proper configuration. This is another reason why customers contract cloud ‘enablers’  to configure the cloud on their behalf, i.e. by adapting some of the default settings that CSPs  provide. While CSPs provide some tools or mechanisms for self-service (e.g. AWS provides  many related services, such as GuardDuty (35), CloudTrail (36), CloudHSM (37) and CloudWatch  (38)), this makes things more complex. Also, customers might not be able to manage it by  themselves.  This is where the ‘dichotomy of control’ challenge arises: while customers want more control  through self-service and customisation, these can also open new threat vectors.  For example, the on-demand self-service provisioning features enable ‘shadow IT’ (39) (40),  which may lead to the use of cloud services without the consent of an IT department. The result  may be unauthorised use of cloud services, which in turn results in increased risk of malware  infections or data exfiltration/loss.  Another challenge related to on-demand self-service provisioning is APIs, which customers use  to manage and interact with cloud services, and which can contain vulnerabilities.  Resource pooling in another attribute in high demand, where the risks can outweigh the benefits  for the demand side. While the benefits for public cloud providers are clear, security risks for the  supply side include the reuse of resources by different tenant applications, placing services that  belong to different tenants on the same server or automated processes that handle the  allocation and de-allocation of resources at the CSP level. Even in the private cloud, where a  (35)  https://aws.amazon.com/guardduty/, accessed November 2022.  (36)  https://aws.amazon.com/cloudtrail/, accessed November 2022.

The assessment also focuses on the respondents’ perceived relevance of cloud services and  the relevance given to cloud cybersecurity regarding the amount of company digital assets and  sensitive data stored in the cloud. Indeed, when combining these last two pieces of information  (percentage of digital assets in the cloud and percentage of sensitive data stored in cloud  services (Figure 13)), the following observations can be made.  • 42 % of companies have a low cloud asset usage and low share of sensitive data  storage online;  • Another 42 % of companies have the opposite tendency, high cloud asset usage and  high share of sensitive data in the cloud;  • The remaining 17 % uses a high percentage of cloud assets but only stores a small  portion of sensitive data online.  These results reveal a divided market, with an almost perfect balance between two opposite  approaches (high and low overall cloud usage, in terms of assets and sensitive data) and a  smaller share of realities opting for a combination of the two.  Figure 13: Percentages of digital assets stored in the cloud  It is indicative that the ENISA cloud certification proposal (41) (EUCS) covers three assurance  levels: ‘Basic’, ‘Substantial’ and ‘High’. These assurance levels can be considered as  overlapping with the three demand-side clusters mentioned above. For example, a high  assurance level would be appropriate to cover cybersecurity requirements for users who have  highly sensitive data stored in the cloud and a heavy usage of cloud services.  4.2.  CLOUD CYBERSECURITY REQUIREMENTS  This section covers the most relevant requirements for cloud security services in terms of  compliance (general data protection regulation, sector-specific or organisational policies, etc.)  and business (availability and resilience, flexibility, business continuity, etc.). They concern  three main service aspects: compliance with regulation, guidelines and best practices; business  (41)  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/news/enisa-news/cloud-certification-scheme, accessed November 2022.  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/news/enisa-news/cloud-certification-scheme  CLOUD CYBERSECURITY MARKET ANALYSIS  Final | 1.0 | Public | March 2023  37  requirements; and other relevant requirements (i.e. geopolitical requirements, supply chain or  procurement rules, etc.).  Regarding compliance requirements (Figure 14), the perceptions of the supply and demand  sides are almost completely aligned, with a focus on enforcing privacy and data protection,  respecting guidelines, standards and best practices (e.g. ISO27001) and achieving compliance  with sector-specific standards (e.g. PCI DSS). The users (demand side) also highlight the  relevance of organisational policies.  Figure 14: Most relevant compliance requirements, supply vs demand perceptions  On the contrary, the relevance given to the different business requirements (see Figure 15)  varies: while demand companies mainly focus on the availability and resilience of services–  and, in a lower regard, on business continuity – suppliers assign a higher relevance to the shift  from Capital Expenditures (CAPEX) to Operational Expenditures (OPEX). Moreover, they give  more importance to requirements such as shorter time to market, the reduction of complexity,  audit and verification.  CLOUD CYBERSECURITY MARKET ANALYSIS  Final | 1.0 | Public | March 2023  38  Figure 15: Most relevant business requirements, supply vs demand perceptions  Other requirements (Figure 16) perceived as relevant by cloud service users (demand side) are  the use of certified services, compliance with geopolitical requirements and compliance with  supply chain/procurement rules. Suppliers agree on the crucial role of geopolitical obligations  but focus more on using certified services and certification schemes.  The shift from CAPEX to OPEX has been used for many years as the main argument to move  to the cloud, as businesses do not need high up-front investment in IT and can only pay for the  computing services they need. when they need them (OPEX model). However, in reality it  seems that this is not so important for the demand side, as opposed to the argument used by  the supply side.  One explanation could be that transition from one model to another proved to be challenging for  organisations with processes in place. While new start-ups do not have this problem, some  organisations that rely on the CAPEX model may be reluctant to shift to the cloud and relinquish  full control of their IT environment. In PaaS environments, for example, the developer often  decides what infrastructure or cloud services to use. This decision is based on performance or  technical concerns, without the cost being the main element for this decision. Losing oversight  or fear of decentralisation are probably the main reasons behind the small number of demand- side respondents supporting the ‘Shift from CAPEX to OPEX’ argument.  CLOUD CYBERSECURITY MARKET ANALYSIS  Final | 1.0 | Public | March 2023  39  Figure 16: Other relevant requirements  4.3.  INTERESTING OBSERVATIONS: CLOUD USAGE PATTERNS AND  REQUIREMENTS  1. Given that half of the demand-side respondents are smaller organisations, they are less  likely to use PaaS model; this was also confirmed by the survey. Application developers  interested in simplifying development and deployment mainly use PaaS. While PaaS  offerings were traditionally the least important service model in terms of revenue, they  recently became more widely adopted through the increased use of micro-service  architectures. Advanced application functionalities, supporting big data, AI and machine- learning capabilities, or the IoT might further drive the adoption of PaaS services, and this  segment could be an opportunity for the emerging cloud providers.  2. Similar conclusions hold for the adoption of private cloud services, where 40 % of the  adoption is in line with the type and size of demand-side respondents. Private cloud  services are usually contracted by larger users, which form about 50 % of respondents of  this study (see Figure 2).  3. The shift from CAPEX to OPEX has been used for many years as the main arguments to  move to the cloud, as businesses do not need high up-front investment in IT. They can pay  only for the computing services they need, and only when they use them (OPEX model).  However, it seems as this is not so important for the demand side, as opposed to the  argument used by the supply side.  The next bullet points set new hypotheses for later conclusions about threat perception.  4. Shared responsibility and ‘dichotomy of control’ in cloud computing usage patterns are  challenges where stakeholder perspectives might differ. While the demand side wants more  control through self-service and customisation, these options may also open new threat  vectors. The on-demand self-service provisioning features, for example, enable ‘shadow  IT’, which is the use of cloud services without an IT department’s consent. This can result in  unauthorised use of cloud services that in its turn may lead to an increase of malware  infections or data exfiltration incidents.  CLOUD CYBERSECURITY MARKET ANALYSIS  Final | 1.0 | Public | March 2023  40  5. Another related challenge is linked to the use of APIs to manage and interact with cloud  services. Such APIs may contain vulnerabilities, thus leading to a compromise of these  management services. These are a security responsibility of the supply side. This situation  may lead to diverging perceptions on related threat exposure between the supply and  demand sides.  6. Resource pooling in another attribute in high demand, where risks can outweigh benefits  for the demand side. While the benefits for public cloud providers are clear, security risks  for the supply side include reuse of resources by different tenant applications, the  positioning of services that belong to different tenants on the same server, and automated  processes that handle the allocation and de-allocation of resources at CSP level. Even in  the private cloud, where a virtual machine could be hosted on any of the servers in the  private cloud, there is a risk that the server might host applications and services that belong  to different security zones, with different authentication and authorisation needs.

CLOUD CYBERSECURITY: THREATS, CHALLENGES AND  CAPABILITIES  The cloud has many benefits and the potential to transform many businesses, but it has also  introduced new cybersecurity challenges and threats. One of the main differences with  ‘traditional’ cybersecurity is that cloud security is a shared responsibility model, with some  challenges and threats originating from its own nature as a cloud, such as we have seen in  Section 2.2.  Cybersecurity threats, challenges and capabilities constitute one of the focuses of this market  analysis. Cybersecurity threats are the reason why cloud services are being enhanced with  cybersecurity features, while cybersecurity challenges emerge from the necessity to reduce  threat exposure or the need to integrate cloud security with the existing security policies on the  customer side. The ability to implement necessary cybersecurity controls reflects the capability  levels on both the demand side and the supply side and is indicative of the level of management  of these threats.  Cloud cybersecurity threats, challenges and capabilities are a common subject of interest for all  the stakeholder types involved in this analysis. The information collected in this regard  constitutes a very good basis to compare views on threats and challenges, but also to assess  the perceived level of threat management.  5.1.1.  Cloud Cybersecurity Threats: Multiplicity of Perception within All  Stakeholder Types  The stakeholders’ perception of the most relevant cybersecurity threats (Figure 17) appears to  be generally aligned among the various stakeholder types, with particular attention given to the  lack of cloud security architecture and strategy, data breaches and abuse of misconfiguration  and inadequate change control. However, some differences are evident, namely the following.  • Demand and supply. Their perception is similar, as both dedicate particular attention to  data breaches and abuse of misconfiguration and inadequate change control. The only  evident difference concerns the abuse of insecure interfaces and APIs, which is not very  relevant for suppliers, while customers are far more worried by this threat. Moreover,  suppliers focus more on the abuse of misconfigurations and inadequate change control  or identity credentials, on the general lack of cloud security architecture and strategy and  on account hijacking.  • Regulatory bodies. Their perception of all threats is heightened compared to the other  actors. The only exceptions are insider threats and account hijacking, by a small margin;  • R & D. Contrary to regulatory bodies, research organisations give less importance than  other actors do to most cybersecurity threats, especially to abuse of insufficient identity,  credential access and key management, abuse of weak control planes and data  breaches. The only exception is insider threats, to which R & D bodies give particular  importance.  CLOUD CYBERSECURITY MARKET ANALYSIS  Final | 1.0 | Public | March 2023  42  Figure 17: Cloud cybersecurity threats, overview of perceptions from all stakeholder types  5.1.2. Cybersecurity Challenges and Level of Implementations  As mentioned in Section 2.4, cybersecurity challenges capture concerns which relate to both  demand and supply regarding the materialisation of a threat. In the current analysis,  cybersecurity challenges were used as a basis to firstly capture the concerns of surveyed  stakeholders; at the same time, cybersecurity challenges were used as an index to measure  implementation efforts to master those challenges. The summary of perceived cybersecurity  challenges provides a comprehensive overview of perceived challenges among all involved  stakeholder types (see Figure 18).  CLOUD CYBERSECURITY MARKET ANALYSIS  Final | 1.0 | Public | March 2023  43  Figure 18: Cloud cybersecurity challenges, overview of all involved stakeholder types  The fact that the list of cybersecurity challenges resembles cybersecurity control groups has  helped survey participants to express the level of implementation within their organisation.  Therefore, based on the collected data, the mastering of cybersecurity challenges is considered  within this analysis as indicative for the cybersecurity capability/maturity level of surveyed  organisations.  This section presents a series of complementary views on threats and challenges: firstly,  participating stakeholders were asked about their perceived level of management of cloud  cybersecurity threats. Secondly, the implementation status of countermeasures to master the  challenges was assessed. Both views are presented in the analysis below.  To reduce threat exposure– and consequently master cybersecurity challenges – organisations  are implementing several cybersecurity measures (Figure 19 and Figure 20): incident detection  and response, IAM, hardware and data security, cloud-native and application security, cloud  infrastructure security and policy enforcement, and antivirus and malware protection. Most  companies have already started to introduce all of the measures mentioned above or expect to  do so in the next 1–2 years, with the only relevant exception of value-added security services,  which 40 % of the supply-side sample companies expect to implement at a later stage (2–5  years); however, the other 60 % of companies have already implemented these services.  Overall, these results confirm the active approach both customers and suppliers have adopted  in enforcing cloud cybersecurity.  CLOUD CYBERSECURITY MARKET ANALYSIS  Final | 1.0 | Public | March 2023  44  Figure 19: Time range of implementation, demand side  Figure 20: Time range of implementation, supply side  Nonetheless, a lot remains to be done. Figure 21 depicts how the general perception on the  demand side is that a significant gap remains between the threats perceived and those  effectively managed, especially regarding the abuse of insecure interfaces and APIs and data  breaches.  A similar gap is registered when comparing perceived and managed cybersecurity threats for  supply companies (Figure 21B): indeed, the lack of incident management is evident, especially  concerning data breaches and abuse of misconfigurations and inadequate change control, two  of the most worrisome threats for all actors, as previously highlighted. However, on a more  CLOUD CYBERSECURITY MARKET ANALYSIS  Final | 1.0 | Public | March 2023  45  positive note, companies’ management of the abuse of insecure interfaces and APIs appears to  be particularly effective.  Results for R & D organisations (Figure 21D) are the most encouraging ones. Indeed, the  management of the following cybersecurity threats goes beyond the perceived threats:  • abuse of limited cloud usage visibility;  • abuse of insufficient identity, credentials, access and key management;  • abuse of insecure interfaces and APIs;  • meta-structure and appli-structure failures; and  • lack of cloud security architecture and strategy.  However, management of data breaches, account hijacking, abuse of weak control planes,  abuse of misconfigurations and inadequate change control and abuse of the nefarious use of  cloud services is still lacking.  Focusing on each stakeholder group, regulatory bodies assign the highest level of importance  to the chain of trust / chain of responsibility, while suppliers deem access control to be a bigger  challenge. Demand-side organisations focus more on audit and access control, and R & D  bodies give the most importance to incident management.  Shifting the focus on regulatory bodies (Figure 21C), once again, an important gap between  perceived threats and their management is evident, especially concerning the three most relevant  cybersecurity menaces (lack of cloud security architecture and strategy, data breaches and abuse  of misconfigurations and inadequate change control). Notably, reported perceived and managed  threats coincide with the abuse of insecure interfaces and APIs; abuse of insufficient identity,  credential access and key management; abuse of weak control planes; insider threats and other  (for example, data extraction for future decrypting); these results suggest that current strategies in  place are deemed adequate for these threats.  CLOUD CYBERSECURITY MARKET ANALYSIS  Final | 1.0 | Public | March 2023  46  Figure 21: Most relevant managed threats – (from top left to bottom right)  A. Demand side, B. Supply side, C. Regulatory bodies side, D. R & D side  5.2.  INCIDENTS AND VULNERABILITIES  In this section we provide an overview of the most impactful security incidents experienced  lately (in the last 12 months) by the cloud cybersecurity market and the cloud infrastructure  vulnerabilities registered, analysing the type and level of consequences they caused and the  relationship with the regulatory bodies in their management.  Before going into the analysis of the survey result, it is important to provide some statistics  related to cloud incidents and cloud vulnerabilities. The statistics below have been assessed via  available open-source publications.  • Number of cloud incidents in 2022. With some 53 % of cloud users suffering an incident  (attack) between 2020 and 2022 (42), there is a significant increase in the detection of  incidents, most commonly caused by phishing (73 %), account compromise (31 %),  ransomware and targeted attacks (29 %) and accidental data leakage (25 %). Remarkably,  incidents caused by these threats have doubled within this period. Consequently, the  percentage of targeted users is expected to continue growing over time.  (42)  https://www.netwrix.com/download/collaterals/Netwrix_Cloud_Data_Security_Report_2022.pdf,  accessed November 2022.  https://www.netwrix.com/download/collaterals/Netwrix_Cloud_Data_Security_Report_2022.pdf  CLOUD CYBERSECURITY MARKET ANALYSIS  Final | 1.0 | Public | March 2023  47  • Number of cloud vulnerabilities in 2022. Though the total number of cloud vulnerabilities  is difficult to assess, vulnerability statistics from a single cloud provider indicate that around  50 vulnerabilities were detected in 2021, around 13 % of them being critical (43). By  extrapolating this number to other major CSPs by analogy, one can easily equate this to  around a few hundred vulnerabilities on a yearly basis.  The impact of incidents reported by demand-side organisations (Figure 22) highlights that the  majority of reported cybersecurity incidents had low (73 %) or no impact (13 %). Only a  small portion (13 %) had a medium impact, and none caused high-level consequences.  These results suggest that even though great attention is devoted towards cybersecurity threats  and an overall sense that more could be done to reduce threat exposure, measures in place are  quite effective, at least in preventing incidents leading to serious consequences.  Figure 22: Demand-side experience with impactful incidents  When looking at the suppliers (Figure 23), the results confirm the effectiveness of the defensive  measures in place, which appear to be even more effective than in demand-side companies.  Indeed, in this case, the majority of causalities had no impact at all on the company (82 %),  while only a small portion had a low (9 %) or medium impact (9 %).  (43)  https://www.beyondtrust.com/resources/whitepapers/microsoft-vulnerability-report, accessed  November 2022.  https://www.beyondtrust.com/resources/whitepapers/microsoft-vulnerability-report  CLOUD CYBERSECURITY MARKET ANALYSIS  Final | 1.0 | Public | March 2023  48  Figure 23: Impact of incidents, supply side  On the other hand, the demand side reported a low number of vulnerabilities communicated by  CSPs (see Figure 24). Given the number of cloud vulnerabilities registered in 2021 and the high  percentage of incidents (i.e. abused vulnerabilities), it is rather unlikely that used cloud services  were not affected by vulnerabilities.  Figure 24: Percentage of the demand -side that received vulnerability report  5.3.  INTERESTING OBSERVATIONS: THREATS, CHALLENGES AND  CAPABILITIES  1. Insider threats are also the most difficult threats to address. It is common concern for both  the demand-side and supply-side perspectives, but modelling of these threats (that include  human factors) is very difficult.  CLOUD CYBERSECURITY MARKET ANALYSIS  Final | 1.0 | Public | March 2023  49  2. Lack of visibility and transparency of cyberthreat management seems to be a topic that  needs to be considered, as it influences market adoption.  3. Differences in threat perception reveal some doubts about ‘shared model responsibility’ in  cloud security: the supply-side might minimise the probability of vulnerabilities in their APIs,  while the demand side would do the same for their misconfigurations.  4. Regulatory stakeholders give more importance to the chain of trust, as they take a more  holistic approach and deal with IT supply-chain security in general.  5. Incident management and audit scores are low on the supply side, which can be explained  by the fact that many CSPs are reluctant to share logs and give access to their cloud for  incident-management services.  6. When seen purely from a cybersecurity perspective, it seems that multi-tenancy is mainly  beneficial for the supply side, as it brings risks for the demand side. However, according to  the data collected, the perception is different.  7. Segments of cloud-native, application and cloud infrastructure cybersecurity and policy  enforcement show a high level of adoption, which is indicative of good cybersecurity  awareness from demand-side stakeholders.  8. Suppliers feel like they are ‘in control’ of API vulnerabilities, while considering ‘customer- side’ threats, such as misconfigurations, as a source of higher risk.  9. Given the relatively low level of vulnerability information communicated to the demand side,  it seems necessary to raise awareness and intensify notification on vulnerabilities both via  the cloud services and the applications used by all users of the cloud services. Eventually,  Service Level Agreements (SLAs) would need to be checked and potentially updated to  include vulnerability notifications to users of the service. New or emerging EU regulations  see vulnerability management as a central part of incident notification; such SLA updates  will hence be mandatory for a variety of products and services, especially the ones used in  critical sectors. If such a change is not made, it could turn into a barrier for market adoption.  CLOUD CYBERSECURITY MARKET ANALYSIS  Final | 1.0 | Public | March 2023  50  6. ROLE OF REGULATION  AND CERTIFICATION  The inclusion of regulatory bodies as a stakeholder type in this analysis has provided a  complementary perspective with regard to their scope, the regulatory instruments used and the  plans for their implementation. This section outlines the regulatory bodies’ influence on the  cloud cybersecurity market. Use of standards and certification constitutes the main instrument  for the fulfilment of cybersecurity requirements. As regards the use of certification, the survey  addresses intentions for the introduction of the EUCS. In addition, an analysis of the plan  developed by various regulatory bodies for its implementation (degree of penetration, timeline of  introduction, funds allocated) has been performed. This includes the EUCS’ impact on the  reduction of cybersecurity threats.  6.1.  TYPES OF REGULATORY ACTIVITIES IN CLOUD CYBERSECURITY  The regulatory supervision of the participated regulatory bodies concentrates on the following  core sectors: government (targeted by 75 % of the involved organisations), communications,  media and services (62 %), banking and security, utilities (50 %), education, manufacturing and  natural resources, transportation (38 %), insurance, healthcare providers (25 %), retail and  wholesale trade (12 %) (see Figure 25).  To quote one of the survey’s participants, ‘a cloud certification scheme is necessary to support a  secure digital single market, the digitalisation and competitiveness of European businesses and  the security of our citizens, businesses, and public administrations’.  Figure 25: Sectors falling into regulatory supervision  CLOUD CYBERSECURITY MARKET ANALYSIS  Final | 1.0 | Public | March 2023  51  However, this does not imply that the adoption of the EUCS will happen in the near future  (Figure 26). Indeed, 62 % of the interviewed regulatory bodies have no plan to transition to this  framework, and 25 % plan to transition, but likely not in the immediate future, as no resources  have been allocated to this intent. Only 12 % of the organisations have planned the transition  and allocated funds for it.  Figure 26: EUCS, an important emerging regulatory instrument  6.2.  THE ROLE OF CERTIFICATION IN CLOUD CYBERSECURITY  The scope of this section is to investigate certifications’ relevance for cloud cybersecurity  providers and the relative instruments used by regulatory bodies. The role of certification has  been assessed for the supply side, demand-side and bodies involved in regulation stakeholder  types. The details of the analysis are presented in the discussion below.  Supply side. Suppliers of cloud services were surveyed about the certifications they use for  their offerings, including about their service and deployment models and cloud attributes. The  certifications used cover both cybersecurity properties, but also process security and quality.  Figure 27 shows the used certifications and standards.  CLOUD CYBERSECURITY MARKET ANALYSIS  Final | 1.0 | Public | March 2023  52  Figure 27: Supply-side certification (standards, attestations, schemes, etc.)  Demand side. Cloud users were surveyed to assess their requirements in terms of certification  and standardisation and expectations regarding the used services. These requirements meet  both their compliance and cybersecurity protection needs. The assessed requirements reflect  the generic intention/desire to use certified services, rather than mentioning specific ones.  Figure 28 shows the percentage of demand-side organisations that use certified cloud services.  CLOUD CYBERSECURITY MARKET ANALYSIS  Final | 1.0 | Public | March 2023  53  Figure 28: Demand-side certification requirements  Regulatory bodies. Bodies involved in regulation consider cloud certification as an important  element for the implementation of cybersecurity protection, coming second among all available  regulatory instruments. It should be mentioned, however, that cybersecurity certification is part  of the EU Member States’ cloud compliance framework (44). Hence, cloud certification has a  potentially higher ranking, as indicated in Figure 31. Taking into consideration the plan to  transition to the EUCS, cloud certification seems to be one of the most important emerging  methods within EU regulatory bodies to achieve proper cybersecurity protection in the cloud  ecosystem (see Figure 26 and Figure 29).  Figure 29: Regulatory instruments  (44)  https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/cloud-computing, accessed November 2022.  https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/cloud-computing  CLOUD CYBERSECURITY MARKET ANALYSIS  Final | 1.0 | Public | March 2023  54  6.3.  INTERESTING OBSERVATIONS: ROLE OF REGULATION AND  CERTIFICATION  1. It is worth noting that a significant number of suppliers still do not use any certifications for  the offered services. It seems that the higher risk appetite of the demand side can be  explained either by the lack of cybersecurity awareness or by a higher prioritisation of  cost/performance issues. Nonetheless, the desire of the demand side to use certified  services (ca. 50 %) does not fully resonate with the supplier side, when considering the  level of supported certifications of offered cloud services.  2. Although the EUCS seems to have become an important EU instrument to achieve better  cybersecurity protection levels, it has not been sufficiently envisaged yet within  implementations in available cloud offerings. This is expected to change when regulators  make their transition to the EUCS in the future (see Figure 26).  .  CLOUD CYBERSECURITY MARKET ANALYSIS  Final | 1.0 | Public | March 2023  55  7. CLOUD CYBERSECURITY  MARKET TRENDS  7.1.  CLOUD CYBERSECURITY MARKET EVOLUTION  Analysis of the collected evidence indicates that cloud cybersecurity is an expanding market,  and most market actors agree that significant market gaps remain. According to demand-side  and supply-side companies and R & D organisations, these uncovered areas mainly concern  three cybersecurity areas/issues: i) privacy and data protection, ii) security-enhancing  technologies and regulation, and iii) the absence of a unified certification method.  The state of cloud cybersecurity and the quality of cloud regulation are perceived as the two  most impactful aspects for market development. This can be attested by the preference of  survey participants for multi-cloud cybersecurity strategies and SaaS solutions. In both cases,  regulatory activities and orchestrated cybersecurity controls are especially crucial. Survey  participants have indicated that deficiencies in this regard may significantly increase exposure  to cyberwarfare and cyberterrorism threats. Although the emergence of these threats has also  been assessed in this year’s ENISA Threat Landscape (45), these survey findings are mainly  motivated by the impressions of cloud stakeholders regarding current geopolitical  developments.  Demand-side companies are also particularly attentive to signs of instability in the market,  paying particular attention to the monopolistic position assumed by hyperscalers. As a matter of  fact, even though the drive to innovate in the field of cybersecurity is lacking momentum,  solutions and cybersecurity controls are gradually being adopted on an individual level.  Concerning cybersecurity drivers, the focus of customers and suppliers is on building a resilient,  trustworthy and highly available cloud environment, incorporating new elements such as deep  integration, IoT, zero-trust security, cloud automation, quantum computing, 5G and the adoption  of AI in cloud services.  7.2.  CLOUD CYBERSECURITY DRIVERS AND BARRIERS  The aim of this section is to investigate the technological and business drivers for the cloud  cybersecurity ecosystem and the relative barriers encountered. In particular, the analysis shifts  beyond cloud cybersecurity-market stakeholder types, investigating the drivers and barriers of  regulatory bodies and R & D initiatives in promoting regulatory compliance and research uptake.  In addition, we analyse the main instruments for research and innovation funding and the  implementation issues (such as lack of skills) encountered in R & D projects.  The technological barriers reported by regulatory bodies (Figure 30) mainly concern four  aspects: access to standards, missing technological equipment (both encountered by 50 % of  interviewed organisations), lack of technological investments (62 % of organisations) and lack of  skills. The latter emerges as the most relevant barrier, as all organisations face it.  (45)  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/enisa-threat-landscape-2022, accessed December 2022.  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/enisa-threat-landscape-2022  CLOUD CYBERSECURITY MARKET ANALYSIS  Final | 1.0 | Public | March 2023  56  Figure 30: Technological barriers according to regulatory bodies  Concerning regulatory barriers (Figure 31), the main limitations registered are a lack of  incentives on the industry side (reported by 43 % of organisations), the already mentioned low  access to standards (57 %), the high implementation costs (71 %) and the lack of skills (86 %).  Analysing these answers and comparing them against the ones concerning technological  barriers, it is possible to conclude that the most critical barriers encountered by regulators are  the lack of resources, the low access to generalised standards and the lack of skills in relevant  organisations, with a significant impact on the ecosystem of cloud cybersecurity.  Figure 31: Main regulatory compliance barriers according to regulatory bodies  Shifting our focus from barriers to drivers for promoting regulatory compliance (Figure 32),  according to regulatory bodies, the most relevant ones are market measures (for 38 % of  interviewed organisations), consumer campaigns (50 %), pilot projects (75 %) and support for  SMEs, namely in the form of monetary incentives (88 %).  Figure 32: Drivers for promoting regulatory compliance according to Regulatory Bodies  Regarding R & D organisations, the surveyed organisations highlighted three main technological  barriers: lack of technological equipment (20 % of R & D bodies); missing access to product  IPRs (40 %) and missing access to standards (40 %) (see also Figure 33).  CLOUD CYBERSECURITY MARKET ANALYSIS  Final | 1.0 | Public | March 2023  57  Figure 33: Technological barriers encountered by R & D organisations  The lack of skills, a barrier already highlighted by regulatory bodies, is also relevant in R & D  organisations (Figure 34). Indeed, half of the interviewed organisations denote a lack of  researcher skills, cybersecurity skills and cloud computing skills, and brain drain; a smaller  proportion (25 %) also report a high fluctuation of skilled personnel.  Figure 34: Lack of skills in research and development organisations  Another relevant barrier for R & D in cloud cybersecurity is the accessibility to research funding  (Figure 35): all organisations state that they face problems in procuring financial resources, with  difficulty levels ranging from ‘challenging’ to ‘hard’.  Figure 35: Accessibility of research funding for research and development organisations  Concerning research funding instruments (Figure 36), R & D organisations rely on EU funds (83  %), mixed funds (private and public) (50 %) or private financing only (33 %). A smaller  CLOUD CYBERSECURITY MARKET ANALYSIS  Final | 1.0 | Public | March 2023  58  proportion (17 % of organisations) also receives funds from local governments, international  governments or international organisations.  Figure 36: Most important instruments for research funding according to R & D organisations  All R & D organisations agree that innovation actions are a core driver in promoting research  and innovation (Figure 37). Moreover, 40 % of the interviewed realities also highlight the  importance of market domination and certification schemes. A smaller percentage (20 %)  indicate missing investments and support for start-ups (namely through incentives) as relevant  drivers for cloud cybersecurity research.  Figure 37: Market/financial/economic/societal drivers according to R & D organisations  7.3. Cloud cybersecurity innovation areas  This section provides an overview of the trending topics in cybersecurity research, identifying  the market’s research and innovation priorities. Current research could develop into future  technology trends, which may one day influence the market; it is therefore crucial to determine  which research topics are considered particularly relevant in the market (supply and demand)  and compare this information with current R & D activity, assessing the state of play in research.  This allows us to estimate the readiness of available technology research results for market  deployment, the impact of adopting new technologies in the market and the time horizons for  technology adoption.  According to the surveyed R & D organisations, the most relevant research topics in cloud  computing related to cybersecurity (Figure 38) are security and integrity; secure computation  outsourcing and privacy in multi-tenancy clouds (all mentioned by 60 % of the involved  organisations); secure mobile cloud computing / fog computing / edge computing and secure  cloud architecture (both at 40 %); virtualisation security; data recovery and backup; cloud  access control and key management; availability; recovery and auditing and other topics (such  as cybersecurity certification and automation) (all at 20 %).  CLOUD CYBERSECURITY MARKET ANALYSIS  Final | 1.0 | Public | March 2023  59  Figure 38: Important researched cybersecurity topics according to R & D organisations  Considering instead cloud computing developments that are already in place and used beyond  research, according to R & D organisations, the most impactful ones (Figure 39) are:  • zero-trust models/architectures (according to 83 % of organisations);  • secure software-development life cycle (SDLC) and DevSecOps for the cloud (83 %);  • cloud-native security tools and platforms (67 %);  • hybrid and multi-cloud environments (50 %);  • other developments, such as automation and AI (17 %).  Figure 39: Impactful cloud computing developments for cybersecurity according to R & D  organisations  7.4. INTERESTING OBSERVATIONS: CLOUD CYBERSECURITY MARKET  TRENDS  1. The comparison between these results and the research priorities for market actors (supply  and demand companies) leads to some interesting insights. Indeed, their interests are  mainly focused on two research streams: privacy and security for the cloud (privacy- enhancing technologies, double encryption, etc.), and innovative technologies (AI, 5G,  CLOUD CYBERSECURITY MARKET ANALYSIS  Final | 1.0 | Public | March 2023  60  quantum computing, superconducting microchips, etc.). While the first research priority  coincides with the information reported by R & D companies, the second stream of activities  does not seem to be a current focus area for cloud cybersecurity R & D organisations.  2. Availability of standards seems to be a significant barrier for both regulatory bodies and R &  D. Although this barrier is well known, no significant corrective measures have been  implemented so far in the EU.  3. Skill shortage seems to be another common barrier. As it is obvious that available skilled  personnel will switch to better paid jobs in the industry, it might be necessary to achieve  better remunerations and/or to ‘pool’ skills by means of public institutions. At the same time,  it is important to foster the creation of corresponding curricula at universities.  4. Innovation areas identified may be an important stepping stone for short-term research, but  also market drivers and market trends.

CONCLUDING REMARKS  In this chapter, conclusions are drawn on the basis of the findings of this cybersecurity market  analysis. The conclusions of this section constitute a synthesis of interesting observations made  in the different Chapters (Chapters 1 to 7) of this analysis, while comparing this against  evidence found in available cloud computing studies. In doing so we:  • use the evidence presented so far by means of findings from the survey, interesting  observations and identified cross-cutting issues;  • seek to validate conclusions by comparing findings to existing cloud reports, obtained  through open-source research (corresponding references can be found in each conclusion  by means of footnotes); and  • highlight the different stakeholder types concerned by each conclusion.  The above elements are included in each conclusion by means of references to interesting  points and similar conclusions found in open-source reports and /references to the concerned  cloud stakeholder types. Within each section, the conclusions drawn are enumerated to  facilitate identification and referencing.  It should be noted that the conclusions drawn do not exhaust all interesting observations of  each of the Chapters 1 to 7. We recommend that interested readers visit this material in order to  gain a better understanding – on a second level of detail – all the interesting topics identified in  this analysis.  Another important note to be made is that the content of these conclusions is not overlap-free:  some of the conclusions below might touch upon issues mentioned in another conclusion  category (sub-section). For example, a conclusion on market trends may affect research issues  and vice-versa. When possible, we have indicated where the content overlaps.  8.1. CONCLUSIONS ON MARKET CHARACTERISTICS AND TRENDS  1. Many demand-side stakeholders are using security services from the same companies that  also provide cloud services, as a kind of ‘bundled offering’, but it is in reality very difficult to  establish market patterns when it comes to security products and services, whether these  are offered directly by the CSPs themselves, by enablers or partners of CSPs, or by  independent suppliers contracted by cloud service consumers (CSCs). In this respect, the  market can be said to be ‘blurred’, as security products/services are bundled with all- inclusive services in such a way as to dilute their distinguishable features.  Evidence from observations: Observations 4 and 5 in Section 3.5, Observation 5 in Section  4.3.  Relevant stakeholder types: supply side, demand side.  2. About 40 % of respondents consider secure mobile cloud computing /fog computing / edge  computing and secure cloud architectures to be the most relevant research topics (see  Figure 38), which echoes the opportunities outlined in the EU report elaborated following  the CEO roundtable ‘Shaping the next generation cloud supply for Europe’ and addressed  to Thierry Breton, European Commissioner for the Internal Market (46).

Secure access service edge (SASE) is presented as an opportunity for  EU players, including a new network security model that combines multiple controls such  as zero-trust network access, a Cloud Access Security Broker (CASB), firewall as a service  and data loss protection. Secure Access in 5G Mobile Networks will lead to the integration  of end-to-end service orchestration of SD-WAN, SASE and mobile networks across the  entire solution.  Evidence from observations: Observations 4 and 5 in Section 3.5, Observation 5 in Section  4.3.  Relevant stakeholder types: supply side, R & D, demand side.  3. While some SASE solutions include the CASB functionality as part of their offering, these  two solutions/functionalities are likely to co-exist, a least for some time. In addition, SASE  looks more like a framework that combines network security and wide-area networking than  a concrete security solution. Its vendors follow an ‘all in one’ approach, as opposed to  security-solution integration or ‘chaining’ done by customers or system integrators on their  behalf. While further service and product consolidation is desirable and expected, in  Gartner’s hype cycle for cloud security for 2021 (47), SASE is at the peak of inflated  expectations.  Evidence from observations: NA (derived as a cross-cutting analysis conclusion).  Relevant stakeholder types: supply side, demand side, R & D.  4. About 60 % of respondents find secure computation outsourcing and privacy in multi- tenancy cloud systems to be the important challenge (48) (see also Figure 38), while 50 %  are planning to implement data-security solutions, which reveals opportunities in emerging  sub-segments such as confidential computing, a technology that mentioned in Gartner’s  hype cycle for cloud security in 2020 and 2021 (49). Confidential computing is a mechanism  that protects sensitive code and data from third parties, including the CSP. Indeed,  confidential computing protects data while it is ‘in use’, or as it is being processed, thus  bridging a gap in common encryption protection that focuses on data at rest or in transit.  Confidential computing is particularly relevant in the context of in-cloud use of data.  Confidential computing also makes it easier to move between different cloud environments  without exposing any sensitive data and is adequate for the scenarios where there is no  mutual trust. In the EU there are already several companies, mainly start-ups, working on  this technology, as well as some mature research on trusted execution environments, multi- party computation and other related topics, which could be an opportunity for EU suppliers.  Ensuring that start-ups working on these technologies receive adequate funding to grow  and become pervasive in cloud computing environments is paramount to ensuring that  security concerns about cloud services are addressed. Furthermore, given the importance  that these market actors have and the protection that they afford users, a certification  scheme laying down qualitative expectations for these organisations’ products might prove  useful.

SDLC and DevSecOps for the cloud were considered as impactful developments by 83 %  of R & D respondents (Figure 39). In addition, 43 % of customers and 62 % of suppliers  plan to implement some solutions related to cloud-native and application security (Figure 19  and Figure 20, respectively). Similar to the intersection of networking and security, in this  area there is a consolidation of features and capabilities provided by previously separated  tools. A cloud-native application protection platform is a segment addressing both SDLC  and the traditional gap between security and DevOps teams, while its focus is on the cloud- native ecosystem. This segment is also halfway between evolution and convergence of  cloud security posture management and cloud workload protection platforms, and is also  expected to consolidate cloud service network security, which in turn has replaced  mechanisms such as a web application firewalls or web application and API protection.  Evidence from observations: Observation 4, Section 7.4.  Relevant stakeholder types: R & D, supply side, demand side.  6. Among cloud security product companies, there are those that address the same security  concerns as ‘on-premises IT’ but adapted to the cloud, while others address security  concerns unique to the cloud. Emerging consolidation is also visible in this area, which  makes procurement very difficult. Some cloud-security segments overlap, while other raise  doubts regarding different alternatives: should customers choose one single vendor that  unifies many different cloud security controls (integration), or should they opt for separated  solutions (‘chaining’ of controls)? This is a question that needs to be further researched and  which may lead to some added-value offerings from suppliers (especially enablers).  Evidence from observations: NA (derived as a cross-cutting analysis conclusion).  Relevant stakeholder types: supply side, demand side.  8.2. CONCLUSIONS EMERGING FROM VARIATING PERCEPTIONS AND  POTENTIAL GAPS  1. The 2021 AWS Cloud Security Report (50), based on a comprehensive survey of 316  cybersecurity professionals and focused on responses to new security threats, noted that  configuration is the top concern (71 %), exfiltration of sensitive data comes second (59 %),  and insecure APIs comes third (54 %). In our survey, misconfigurations scored high as a  threat with supply-side respondents (75 %, see Figure 21), with the highest gap between  perceived and managed threats. On the demand side, this gap is not as big for this specific  threat, but becomes significant when it comes to insecure APIs, which are perceived as a  threat by 60 % of demand-side respondents (see Figure 21).  Evidence from observations: Observations 3 and 8 in Section 5.3 and Observation 5 in  Section 4.3.  Relevant stakeholder types: supply side, demand side.  2.  Misconfigurations scored high as a threat with supply-side respondents (around 75 %, see  Figure 21), with the highest gap between perceived and managed threats. However, there  are different kinds of misconfigurations in the cloud, related to the different responsibilities  of CSPs and CSCs, and different tools and controls that deal with this threat. Infrastructure- as-code scanning, for example, is a form of automation to minimise cloud misconfiguration  risks, as it ensures code quality of the cloud infrastructure configuration files. Cloud  infrastructure entitlements management – which appeared as a separated cloud security  segment very recently –deals, among other things, with IAM misconfigurations. Both  solutions are increasingly being seen as yet another feature of the cloud-native application  protection platform. Furthermore, customers said they require some (53 %) or extensive (20  (50)  https://www.cybersecurity-insiders.com/portfolio/2021-aws-cloud-security-report-cloudpassage/,  accessed November 2022.  https://www.cybersecurity-insiders.com/portfolio/2021-aws-cloud-security-report-cloudpassage/  CLOUD CYBERSECURITY MARKET ANALYSIS  Final | 1.0 | Public | March 2023  64  %) help with the customisation of cloud applications, including security configurations (51).  This also shows that beyond specific cloud-service solutions, there is still a large demand  for cloud security enablers, i.e. companies that act on behalf of the customer, implement,  integrate or deploy different cloud security solutions.  Evidence from observations: Observation 3 and 8 in Section 5.3.  Relevant stakeholder types: supply side, demand side.  3. CSPs prioritised ‘security of the cloud’, in other words keeping their cloud infrastructure and  stack secure, which is not always their responsibility. They also offer some security  services – such as monitoring, detection, and security management services – to their  clients, which can be bundled together with cloud services or provided separately. A CSC  cannot presume that the vendor of their cloud environment will be entirely responsible for  security; they need to look for the best solution through additional investment in products  and services. The absence of clearly delimited responsibilities leads to both uncertainties,  the risk of over - or underlaps and increased resources requirements. Making CSPs fully  responsible may solve this problem. The key consideration is currently the ‘shared  responsibility model’, often linked to a service-level agreement.  Evidence from observations: Observation 9 in Section 5.3.  Relevant stakeholder types: supply side, demand side.  4.  Threats such as abuse of insufficient or inappropriate identity, credentials, access and key  management are perceived as important both by suppliers (over 50 %, see Figure 21) and  by demand-side respondents (around 50 %, see Figure 21). While cloud IAM solutions exist  and are used (implemented by 84 % of demand-side respondents according to the survey,  see Figure 19), they have limitations in the multi-cloud environment. Each CSP has its own  policies, and mapping permissions across different platforms at scale is a challenge; for this  reason, organisations also use Cloud Infrastructure Entitlements Management (CIEM). This  is a topic that needs further elaboration in order to obtain a more efficient deployment and  use of available controls on both sides (supply and demand). Eventual involvement of  R & D might facilitate the identification of possible solutions in this regard (52).  Evidence from observations: NA (derived as a cross-cutting analysis conclusion).  Relevant stakeholder types: supply side, demand side, R & D.  8.3. CONCLUSIONS ON MARKET BARRIERS  1. Lack of visibility and transparency and related threats are perceived very differently in our  survey by suppliers (around 25 %, see Figure 21) and demand-side respondents (almost  25 %, see Figure 21). This observation is confirmed in the 2022 Fortinet Cloud Security  Report (by 49 % of respondents) (53). As differences in perceptions are important barriers  for market adoption, one can argue that the entire conclusions of Section 8.2 can be  considered as issues to be addressed for a better adoption of cloud cybersecurity  throughout the market both within the EU and internationally.  Evidence from observations: Observation 2 in Section 5.3.  Relevant stakeholder types: supply side, demand side.  2. Lack of skills also emerges as the most relevant barrier for adoption, as perceived by all  stakeholders (around 78 % of all respondents on average, see Figure 30, Figure 31, Figure  34). In (ISC)2’s 2022 Cloud Security Report (54), 78 % of respondents claimed that  (51)  https://tbri.com/tbr-insight-center/cloud-and-software-competitive-intelligence/customer-  research/cloud-applications/, accessed November 2022.

Evidence from observations: Observation 3 in Section 7.4.  Relevant stakeholder types: supply side, regulatory bodies, R & D.  3. It bears noting that a significant amount of supplier still do not hold any certifications for the  offered services. On the other hand, it seems that the higher risk appetite of the demand  side can be explained either by the lack of cybersecurity awareness or by a higher  prioritisation of cost/performance issues. Nonetheless, the desire of the demand side to use  certified services (around 50 %), does not fully resonate with the supply side, when  considering the adoption level of the existing cloud service certifications. This may be  considered as another barrier for the adoption of cloud services, especially when  compliance requirements on the demand side do matter (e.g. financial sector, other critical  sectors).  Evidence from observations: Observation 9 in Section 6.3 (almost as is).  Relevant stakeholder types: supply side, demand side, regulatory bodies.  4. Availability of standards and necessary IPRs seems to be a significant barrier for both  regulatory bodies and R & D. Although this barrier is well-known in almost all domains, no  significant corrective measures have been implemented so far in the EU.  Evidence from observations: Observation 2 in Section 6.3 (almost as is).  Relevant stakeholder types: supply side, regulatory bodies, R & D.  5. Given the relatively low level of vulnerability information communicated to the demand side,  it seems necessary to raise awareness and intensify notification on existing vulnerabilities  both in the cloud services and the used applications for all users of the cloud services.  Eventually, SLAs would need to be checked and potentially updated to include vulnerability  notification to users of the service. New or emerging EU regulations see vulnerability  management as a central part of incident notification, therefore such SLA updates will be  mandatory for a variety of products and services, especially the ones used in critical  sectors. If such a change is not made, it could turn into a barrier for market adoption.  Evidence from observations: Observation 2 in Section 5.3 (as is).  Relevant stakeholder types: supply side, demand side, regulatory bodies.  8.4. CONCLUSIONS ON RESEARCH AND INNOVATION TOPICS  1. Zero-trust model/architectures also confirmed in our survey as one of the main  developments in cloud computing that may be impactful for cybersecurity, according to  83 % of organisations (Figure 39). This is confirmed by market trends (55), where SASE  vendors are already incorporating functionalities or capabilities of zero trust, while replacing  or converging with other cybersecurity capabilities and tools such as the virtual private  network (VPN) or even capabilities of more recent solutions such as the (CASB)  functionality. Cloud infrastructure security and policy enforcement was considered to be  implemented by around 37 % of the respondents in our study, which shows how important  this area is (Figure 19).

The comparison between the analysis results of the chapter on cybersecurity market trends  (see Chapter 7) and the research priorities for market actors (demand-side and supply-side  organisations) leads to some interesting insights. Indeed, assessed demand-side and  supply-side trends mainly focus on two research streams: privacy and security for the cloud  (privacy-enhancing technologies, double encryption, etc.) and innovative technologies (AI,  5G, quantum computing, superconducting microchips, etc.). While the first research priority  coincides with the information reported by R & D companies, the second stream of activities  does not seem to be a current focus of R & D organisations. Hence, these areas might be  excellent candidates for a deployment action, given the fact that the underlying  technologies have matured and that corresponding products do exist (e.g. AI, 5G), while  other technologies are in the advanced prototype phase (e.g. quantum computing and  supercomputing).  Evidence from observations: Observation 1 in Section 7.4 (almost as is).  Relevant stakeholder types: R & D, supply side, demand side.  8.5. FURTHER CONSIDERATIONS AND PROJECTIONS  Beyond the conclusion formulated above, both this analysis and the open-source research  performed have revealed some additional points that are worth analysing, in order to gain  valuable insights into future market developments. They mainly concern possible paths through  which vendors might evolve their market strategies in order to use emerging market  opportunities. One of the main dilemmas on the demand side is related to the strategy regarding  the so-called ‘cloud ecosystem’ around hyperscalers (mainly Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure and  AWS).  There are important trends in these strategies. The Microsoft Partner Network (with 400 000  member organisations) became the Microsoft Cloud Partner Program in October 2022, targeting  all partners in the ecosystem, for companies selling services, software solutions or devices. Six  solution areas are aligned to Microsoft market strategy: Data & AI (Azure), Infrastructure (Azure),  Digital & App Innovation (Azure), Business Applications, Modern Work and Security. Microsoft will  divide partners into ‘peers’, according to their capability score.  In this ecosystem, we include all types of ‘vendors’: there are smaller CSPs, but also what we call  ‘enablers’. Enablers are organisations offering advisory and consulting services, cloud security- system integration, cloud security products, application development services and cloud security  operations, management and maintenance. We should also not forget that some CSPs are on  ‘both sides’, acting as a customer of large hyperscalers, but also as a provider for the customers  further down the value chain (this is the case for many organisations that rely on IaaS to provide  their SaaS services). In our survey we included many types of enablers, including resellers,  administrators and integrators.  While hyperscalers increasingly try to provide end-to-end services within a single-cloud vendor  scenario, large system integrators reorient their strategy towards orchestration, including  deployment of different cloud services in multi-cloud and hybrid-cloud settings. Most of these  vendors are part of all three hyperscaler ecosystems and generate revenue from all three. Finally,  in some cases, a joint venture between CSP and system integrators or consulting companies is  established.  Hyperscalers have their own service branch: Microsoft has enterprise services (in 2020  Microsoft’s consulting services were also launched), AWS has global services, Proserve and  AWS have managed services, while Google has a cloud professional services organisation.  However, a headcount of these service organisations reveals that the number of trained  professionals in the partner ecosystem is still much higher than in CSP professional service  branches. While cloud professional services are estimated to be around 38 % of the overall cloud  CLOUD CYBERSECURITY MARKET ANALYSIS  Final | 1.0 | Public | March 2023  67  market in 2021 (56), we estimated that 90 % of that revenue belongs to partners in hyperscalers  and other CSP ecosystems.  These considerations are indicative. It might be interesting to perform a dedicated analysis in  the area of cloud computing strategies to identify the potential and prospective market footprint.  Though quite specific, such an analysis could be performed either by means of an appropriately  scoped market analysis or as a foresight exercise, possibly via an EU-funded research project.

    "abstract": "The present European Union Agency for Cybersecurity (ENISA) report is an analysis of the cloud cybersecurity market, planned for in ENISA’s Work Programme 2022 ( ) under activity O.7.1., ‘Market analysis on the main trends in the cybersecurity market on both the demand side and the supply side’. The selection of this segment for this year’s cybersecurity market analysis is the result of a poll carried out with the involvement of multiple stakeholders, both outside and within ENISA. The criteria used for the prioritisation of the collected proposals were the size of the relevant market, the importance and criticality of the market for businesses of all sizes, relevance of the sector to EU policy, relevance to research and relevance to regulatory activities."

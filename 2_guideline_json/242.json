While Europe and the world recover from a public health crisis, it is vitally  important to identify future challenges and opportunities.  This decade, the EU will increase investment in research and innovation (R&I)1. One of the  focus areas will be the digital transformation of the economy and society that works for people  by promoting the European way of life, supporting democracy and values, and protecting its  strategic autonomy. In this context, the work of the research community is crucial in creating the  knowledge necessary to understand what lies ahead. The EU is a strong player in knowledge  and innovation: it accounts for almost 20% of global research and development, publishing and  patenting activities2.  This document offers a forward-looking perspective on some of these challenges and  opportunities. It recognises the importance of key structural trends with major implications for  the EU's digital ambitions to 2030 and beyond. The multidisciplinary nature of these trends led  to the selection of four main themes that form the structure adopted for this report:  hyperconnected world, intelligent systems3, cybersecurity in life sciences  (biotechnology), and computational security.  Digital hyperconnectivity4 is a trigger for all other trends and is independent of any particular  technology. Ubiquitous connectivity will increase the convergence of industries, products,  technologies and services, driven by the accelerated datafication5 of everything. The growing  appetite for data will help make technology smarter as the next frontrunner in the race for  greater automation and optimisation in everyday life. In addition, hyperconnectivity, datafication  and intelligent automation6 also contribute to research in the life sciences. This decade, as a  result of the pandemic and the efficiency of biotechnology, the EU will increase investment in  the research and development of new technologies for the pharmaceutical and health sectors7.  However, hyperconnectivity and intelligent automation do not come without challenges. While  the benefits are well known, the challenges and risks are yet to be fully recognised.  Cybersecurity is crucial to ensure that EU citizens, businesses and organisations can enjoy the  1 https://european-union.europa.eu/priorities-and-actions/actions-topic/research-and-innovation_en, last accessed  November 2021.  2 https://ec.europa.eu/info/publications/science-research-and-innovation-performance-eu-2020_en, last accessed  November 2021.  3 Although they are not the same (intelligent systems could also include AI-based software systems), for simplicity, in the  context of this paper we are using the two terms interchangeably.  4 The term refers to the use of multiple means of communication, such as email, instant messaging, telephone, face-to-face  contact and Web 2.0 information services.

INTRODUCTION  1.1 OBJECTIVES, METHODOLOGY AND TARGET AUDIENCE  The main objective of this document is to identify areas of cybersecurity R&I that are critical to  the EU's strategy and ambitions for the digital decade. The report is intended to fulfil ENISA's  mandate9 to advise EU institutions, bodies, offices and agencies, as well as Member States, on  new and future research needs and priorities. The information contained in this document will  be further developed to help identify funding priorities for future work programmes of the  European Cybersecurity Competence Centre and National Coordination Centres.  The four research topics explored in this document were selected primarily through consultation  with stakeholders and members of the research community. From a methodological  perspective, ENISA would select these topics mainly from trends identified in an annual  foresight exercise. However, exceptionally this year and since the ENISA foresight team was  taking its first steps, the topics were discussed with stakeholders and agreed internally.  The selected research topics are not exhaustive of all areas where cybersecurity research is  needed. They are the culmination of several smaller desktop research activities and  consultations with experts carried out during 2021. The work presented here is the consolidated  and highly condensed result of several interactions between ENISA members and experts from  the research community.  In the first phase, experts were asked to provide input on their research topics, from which a  general overview of the cybersecurity research and policy landscape was compiled. This input  took the form of written contributions from each expert. In these contributions, the experts  outlined key areas for further research in their respective fields. These documents were then  consolidated and served as inspiration for a workshop that took place in October 2021. During  this workshop, each research topic was discussed and an attempt was made to find a common  thread for R&I. This document is based on the contributions and results of this workshop.  This report is targeted at stakeholders involved in the research and innovation area from EU  Institutions, Bodies, Agencies, Member States and the wider cybersecurity research community.  This report may be especially relevant for:  • members from the eu and national entities involved in funding programmes for  research,  • policymakers,  • academics, researchers and R&D actors from the cybersecurity industry.  1.2 EU POLICY CONTEXT  In 2020, the President of the European Commission declared that ‘we are living in Europe’s  Digital Decade’10. At the end of 2020, the European Commission and the High Representative  presented a Joint Communication on ‘The EU’s Cybersecurity Strategy for the Digital  Decade’11. With these guiding documents, the EU is showing that it is proactively reacting to  9 Article 11 of the Cybersecurity Act, https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/cybersecurity-act, last accessed  November 2021.  10 European Commission, ‘COMMISSION STAFF WORKING DOCUMENT Accompanying the Document Proposal for a  Decision of the European Parliament and of the Council Establishing the 2030 Policy Programme 'Path to the Digital  Decade'’.  11 https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/ALL/?uri=JOIN:2020:18:FIN, last accessed November 2021.  https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/cybersecurity-act https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/ALL/?uri=JOIN:2020:18:FIN  RESEARCH AND INNOVATION BRIEF  Final | 1.0 | TLP-G | May 2022  8  the global challenges posed by cyberthreats and presenting the EU as an actor that is aware of  the challenges that have to be faced in the forthcoming years.  The EU is fulfilling this role in several ways. Firstly, it is seeking to take a leading role in shaping  the global rules for the use of technology and has been doing so for a long time12. It seeks,  wherever possible, to build global consensus on the tools and mechanisms for developing safe  and resilient technologies. The EU works with partners, both state and non-state actors, to build  a coherent and trusted framework for cooperation.  Secondly, the EU has developed a discourse of ‘open strategic autonomy’ that seeks to develop  a coherent EU-wide narrative for developing EU-level capabilities to respond to threats in the  world. Thirdly, the EU policy toolkit which will be focused on the NIS Directive13 (currently under  revision), the Cybersecurity Act (2019) and the forthcoming Cybersecurity Resilience and  Semiconductor Acts14, is due to be proposed in 2022. The European Council has also called for  a Join Cyber Unit15 to further develop the EU's cybersecurity toolkit.  Fourthly, and crucially for the aims of this report, the EU is investing in cybersecurity research  and development. The recently established ECCC demonstrates the commitment to this area in  a European policy and research context. This includes the development of technological  solutions and tools that enable an effective response to current and future risks and  cyberthreats. These include new and emerging information and communication technologies  and are designed to effectively deploy risk prevention technologies.  Despite the efforts described above, the security of cyberspace will continue to be an ongoing  project. Enormous efforts have been made to develop initiatives that support the development  of competences in this area. However, the opportunity and need to diversify the cybersecurity  R&I agenda is evident. The effort required to continue to meet the standard missions of  government agencies is creating a paradigm shift in the sense that cybersecurity risks and  threats are not limited to areas outside of government security. Nor do traditional systems of  policymaking apply in our hyperconnected world. Therefore, an approach that crosses the  different silos of R&I is needed.  12 European Commission and European External Action Service, ‘Cybersecurity Strategy’.  13 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/nis-directive, last accessed November 2021.  14 https://www.europarl.europa.eu/legislative-train/theme-a-europe-fit-for-the-digital-age/file-european-cyber-resilience-act,  last accessed November 2021.  15 https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/joint-cyber-unit, last accessed November 2021.  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/nis-directive https://www.europarl.europa.eu/legislative-train/theme-a-europe-fit-for-the-digital-age/file-european-cyber-resilience-act https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/joint-cyber-unit  RESEARCH AND INNOVATION BRIEF  Final | 1.0 | TLP-G | May 2022  9  1.3 THE EU CYBERSECURITY RESEARCH LANDSCAPE  Figure 1: Google Ngram of the term\"cybersecurity\" 1995-2021  Cybersecurity R&I is a crucial aspect of research in a number of policy domains. The  emergence of this field, witnessed by the exponential growth of literature in the field since  around 2013 (with the so-called Snowden revelations), indicates that ‘cybersecurity’ as a term  has emerged in contemporary discourse.  The EU and European research funding agencies contribute a large number of resources to  research in the field of cybersecurity. Efforts are driven across a number of agencies, and  through a number of different instruments. In a research field that encompasses so many policy  fields, the pluralism inherent in the funding and organisational structures is to be expected, and  even welcomed. But they are not the world’s leading funding agencies for published research in  the field by far.  Figure 2 identifies the funding provided by different bodies for research in the field of  cybersecurity that has been indexed in the Web of Knowledge (i.e. peer reviewed papers in  scientific journals). This clearly shows that US research funding agencies dominate the field,  with around 43% of published research in this broad field being supported by public funding  from the US government. More recent data, considering only the most cited papers from 2021  and 2022 (pre-prints), shows that European researchers are now emerging in this field, with  universities like the Technical University of Delft, Aarhus University, and several universities in  Spain generating research output that is being cited by the cybersecurity community.  RESEARCH AND INNOVATION BRIEF  Final | 1.0 | TLP-G | May 2022  10  1.4 MAPPING THE LANDSCAPE  Figure 2: Sources of funding for research in the field of cybersecurity (Source: Web of  Science)  Figure 2 depicts the investment in cybersecurity research from region to region. The European  Cybersecurity Atlas16 highlights the focus of some 750 research centres working on  cybersecurity issues in the EU. In terms of education and training, ENISA's own database on  cybersecurity in higher education, CYBERHEAD17, presents well over 100 educational  programmes in almost all EU and EFTA Member States. These programmes point to the  growing need to develop holistic approaches to dealing with the security threats and risks  associated with the increasing importance and emergence of new hyperconnected technologies  that are shaping our world. At the same time, many institutes are focusing on the technological  expertise needed to be at the forefront of research worldwide. In the European Union, there are  a number of projects, initiatives and networks that promote the field of cybersecurity in the EU.  The 2017 Cybersecurity Literacy Survey18 conducted by DG JRC in collaboration with DG  CNECT relied on a survey of over 600 people from European countries to analyse research  activities. This identified a large number of research centres and activities engaged in  cybersecurity research. This survey was accompanied by the development of a taxonomy of  cyberspace to support the categorisation of cyberspace competences. The European  Cybersecurity Taxonomy19 is a useful tool to facilitate the categorisation of the Union’s  cybersecurity competencies. Cybersecurity is inherently a cross-cutting topic, encompassing  many different research areas, academic disciplines and policy fields.  The cybersecurity research landscape is comprised of a wide range of different activities,  touching upon technical and social research, as well as policy in this sphere. Integration  between these strands of action needs to be addressed holistically in research in order to  16 https://cybersecurity-atlas.ec.europa.eu/centres-in-europe, last accessed November 2021.  17 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/cybersecurity-education/education-map/, last accessed November 2021.  18 https://ec.europa.eu/jrc/en/research-topic/cybersecurity/cybersecurity-competence-survey, last accessed November  2021.  19 https://publications.jrc.ec.europa.eu/repository/handle/JRC118089, last accessed November 2021.  https://cybersecurity-atlas.ec.europa.eu/centres-in-europe https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/cybersecurity-education/education-map/ https://publications.jrc.ec.europa.eu/repository/handle/JRC118089  RESEARCH AND INNOVATION BRIEF  Final | 1.0 | TLP-G | May 2022  11  ensure that outputs have the broadest impact. We need to build bridges between different  disciplines and stakeholders in order to ensure acceptance of and engagement with the  richness of the research landscape in cybersecurity in the EU.  RESEARCH AND INNOVATION BRIEF  Final | 1.0 | TLP-G | May 2022  12  2. A SECURE AND HUMAN- CENTRED  HYPERCONNECTED WORLD  The concept of a hyperconnected world is not defined by technology alone, but by the social,  economic and political implications it brings. The notion of hyperconnectivity was originally  defined by social scientists20 to refer to people in networked organisations and societies that are  constantly connected through a variety of digital means. Massive connectivity exists in many of  our digital environments and represents the interactions between various information systems,  data and many devices connected via the Internet. Recent discussions within certain  technology platforms and beyond talk about the emergence of a ‘metaverse’ as an approach to  understanding our relationship between immersive, data-driven environments and our daily  lives.  In computer networking, hyperconnectivity refers to all things communicating through a network,  encompassing person-to-person, person-to-machine and even machine-to-machine  communications. This will be possible with the massive increase in network coverage,  input/output communication (MIMO) and bandwidth. Current and future generations of mobile  communications such as 5G and 6G offer that possibility.  The introduction of 6G wireless communications is still about a decade away. Nonetheless, the  first discussions about new technologies and potential applications for this next generation have  already begun. Broadly speaking, the current question is whether 6G should be an  improvement on 5G in terms of core features, or whether it should go beyond existing coverage  into new areas, such as underwater and in space, or even at the molecular level.  Moreover, the increasing digitisation of business and society, with the advent of online  shopping, FinTech, cryptocurrencies, social media and many other transformative technologies,  are harnessing connectivity everywhere, all the time. With hyperconnectivity, the digital  economy and society will increasingly rely on the network to transform the way companies do  business and the way we all live.  With an increasingly connected digital economy and society, cybersecurity will also become  increasingly important. The frequency and sophistication of cyberthreats will continue to  challenge many individuals and organisations. Hyperconnectivity has increased the vulnerability  of connected individuals, institutions and nations. It represents a new challenge to humanity in  how it defines scale with hundreds of millions of connected individuals.  Multidisciplinary and future-oriented research will be required to facilitate the transition  to this inevitable hyperconnected world.  Foresight has an important role to play in providing early insights into the technological and  social changes that will shape this future, and in taking actions that will help define a desirable  and globally beneficial hyperconnected future. Cybersecurity research will lay the foundations  for building a trustworthy and reliable hyperconnected world.  20 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperconnectivity, last accessed November 2021.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperconnectivity  RESEARCH AND INNOVATION BRIEF  Final | 1.0 | TLP-G | May 2022  13  2.1 THE DATAFICATION OF EVERYTHING  The process of digitalisation - often referred to as digital transformation - is profoundly changing  our economy and society. It will continue affecting individuals, businesses and organisations  throughout this decade. The wake-up call for all the future research challenges and  opportunities described in this document occurs at a time of growing political awareness of  digital dependency in the economy and society.  The most noteworthy pattern in this digital transformation is the data-driven world we live in, a  world that will be always on, always tracking, always monitoring, always listening and always  watching – because it will be always learning. What we perceive to be randomness will be  bounded into patterns of normality by sophisticated algorithms that will take our data to deliver  the future in new and personalised ways. Data are often considered to be an asset but we see  that, in contemporary society, data are emerging as a space of contestation that goes beyond  the ‘data is the new oil’ debate, pushing us towards conceiving of data as the ‘new air’21.  An important discussion is how hyperconnectivity will the drive the datafication-of-everything  with the expansion of use cases, data collectors and data processors. The list below highlights  some of the challenges in the coming decades.  • The appetite for personal data: with hyperconnectivity, the opportunities for data  collection increase significantly. Among the most sensitive are personal identifiable  information and geolocation which, if breached or stolen, may cause severe impacts on  citizens’ privacy, the economy and society.  • A growing interest in surveillance of citizens: there is a general concern about the  increasing interest of private (corporate) and state-sponsored agents in the  surveillance of citizens and organisations. With hyperconnectivity and the growing  appetite for data, eavesdropping could become a major threat, compromising the  privacy and protection of users’ data.  • The use of technology to expand the risks affecting the fundamental rights of EU  citizens: the rapid increase in the use of artificial intelligence to explore data collected  and maintained by digital platforms may pose risks to the fundamental rights of  citizens. It may lead to infringements of privacy, data protection and equal treatment,  particularly when it comes to the growing use of Big Data through the rapid advances  in machine learning.  Questions pointing to research needs and priorities in the context of an hyperconnected world:  • What are the consequences for humanity in a hyperconnected world?  • How will hyperconnectivity affect the security of cyberspace?  • What are the conceptual frameworks required before transitioning to a hyperconnected world?  21 ‘Answering Europe’s Call: Storing and Processing EU Data in the EU’. 2021.

THE AGE OF INTELLIGENT  SYSTEMS  Artificial intelligence (AI) is one of the most transformative forces of our time and key to the EU's  ambitions and strategy for the digital decade. The importance and expansion of its influence is  referenced in various parts of this document. AI will continue to transform the way businesses  and organisations work, manage data and interact with users through a blend of advanced  technologies, such as machine learning (ML), natural language processing (NLP) and cognitive  computing. There are still areas where more research and development is needed to promote  trustworthy and reliable AI that supports the rights of EU citizens and respects EU values.  In order to map the domain, defined by a complex and open-ended relation with cybersecurity,  we made a clear distinction between ‘AI used to harm’ and ‘AI used to protect’.  Potential offenders are highly innovative and may develop algorithms, solutions or procedures  that eventually become new standards in the cybercrime arena. Moreover, even a ‘secure and  trustworthy’ system may later be hijacked by a different actor with malicious intent.  Participants at the intersection of cybersecurity and AI often find themselves caught between  the creation of knowledge and market initiatives, such as academic research being mingled with  R&D in a more blurred way than usual, peer-reviewed literature coexisting with major players  involved in AI and cybersecurity issues on their own terms, major advisory agencies and  consultants (often former or active C-level executives), all contributing to the collective progress  of this research field.  AI in cybersecurity applications can be classified in the following categories: AI-powered  defence mechanisms, cyberthreats exploiting AI, attacks against AI-based security mechanisms  (mechanisms using AI to promptly detect, identify and accommodate the consequences of  cyberattacks) and defences for AI-based protection mechanisms (to secure and protect AI- based mechanisms from malicious attempts).  To lay the groundwork for this exploration, a case analysis has been conducted on two focus  areas that are of particular importance as they demonstrate a strong interdependence between  AI and cybersecurity issues.  3.1 AI TO IMPROVE CYBERSECURITY DEFENCES  A first research focus should be on using AI to improve cybersecurity defences. In this regard,  research should focus on common cybersecurity tasks, such as the prediction and prevention of  attacks, detection of threats and intrusion, response, planning and other areas, and in what  ways AI and ML tasks, techniques and methods can be applied to address them.  AI tools offer high performance at low cost and in real time. Areas of cybersecurity for which  AI/ML offer promising solutions include applications that require the processing of large  amounts of data. In particular AI/ML can automate threat detection (both known and emerging  threats), using pattern recognition and anomaly detection methods. AI approaches can be used  for spam, intrusion, and malware detection and classification. Support Vector Machine (SVM) is  one of the most prominent algorithms for anomaly detection and pattern recognition (malware,  RESEARCH AND INNOVATION BRIEF  Final | 1.0 | TLP-G | May 2022  16  spam, and intrusion detection22). Other algorithms have also been used for spam and intrusion  detection23. Ensemble methods, which combine multiple ML tools, have been used to detect  malware24 and intrusions25.  AI-based defences that use supervised and unsupervised approaches, as well as bio- inspired algorithms26 and auto-encoders, may prevent attacks such as Distributed Denial  of Service (DDoS), ransomware, zero-day attacks27.  In addition, AI-based systems may also predict the most vulnerable points of attack, enabling  operators to plan and allocate resources accordingly. In general, manual responses cannot  keep up with the increasing number of automated threats, and this is exactly where AI-based  solutions show great potential. However, the efficiency of such tools depends on the availability  and quality of data. In most cases, not all the necessary information is available to feed the  algorithms in advance, e.g. attack data within the proper context.  3.2 AI TO ORCHESTRATE CYBERATTACKS  A second research focus should be on protecting AI against its possible use to orchestrate  cyberattacks, as well as against attacks on AI-based mechanisms and tools28.  Attackers exploit  AI to increase the attack efficiency, discover vulnerable points of entry, identify previously  unknown weak points, automate the attack mechanism and extend its impact. Examples of  such attacks include malicious personalised tweets or Deep-Fakes29 using Generative  Adversarial Networks30 (GAN). AI can also be used to improve the efficiency of malware by  using, for example, reinforcement learning techniques.  Based on current assumptions, such as the availability of a vast amount of high-quality data and  stationarity over time, R&I efforts should focus on small data, end-to-end solutions and on  minimising the need for domain expertise. R&I should regularly assess the validity of the  developed model(s), be able to incorporate non-stationarities (i.e. changes in the time variance  of system states), carefully examine the available dataset to detect and eliminate existing  biases and imbalances, as well as develop standardised datasets, to reliably reproduce and  compare existing AI-based solutions.  22 Baigaltugs Sanjaa and Erdenebat Chuluun.

These cover a wide spectrum of cybersecurity applications and represent  real-world conditions to some extent.  AI tools and mechanisms are the attack points themselves, i.e. through their own vulnerabilities  in open-source software libraries, data poisoning (attacks that poison training data), adversarial  attacks based on GAN, as well as reverse-engineering of the trained model32.  Finally, there are a number of AI-specific requirements that are particularly relevant when  addressing cybersecurity applications. AI-based tools and methods should be verifiable,  reliable, explainable, robust against adversarial attacks, auditable and unbiased. At the same  time, to effectively address these requirements, AI should integrate multidisciplinary  perspectives such as socio-technical, economic, regulatory, cultural and cognitive points of  view.  Importantly, the work produced for this document identified existing gaps and provided  directions for future research that will ensure intelligent and effective deployment of AI as a tool  for increased cybersecurity.  Questions pointing to research needs and priorities in the context of intelligent systems:  • How to use AI to design intelligent defence solutions able to detect and identify attacks against systems,  networks and programs?  • How to understand the use of AI in orchestrating cyberattacks?  • What about the validation value chain that is particular to science and scientists? How can the work of  researchers be validated through different forms of publication, such as blogs, independent websites, relays  of big companies’ presentations, in other words, a huge debating grey literature, discussing a truly fast- changing reality?  Possible research focus:  • Development of a standardised performance evaluation framework;  • Design of approaches for the monitoring of large-scale and possibly interconnected systems;  • Exploration of biomimetic cybersecurity algorithms;  • Incorporation of the security-by-design concept (assess the security of the protection mechanisms against  a standardised framework considering diverse malicious attempts);  • Preservation of the privacy and confidentiality of the information flow;  • Inclusion of context awareness in ML in order to boost resiliency.  31 a) KDD Cup 99 and DEFCON serving research on intrusion detection and modelling, b) CTU-13 covering real botnet  traffic, c) Spambase and SMS Spam which are collections of SMSs and e-mails facilitating spam classification purposes, d)  CICIDS2017 providing full-packet traffic data recorded at the Canadian Institute for Cybersecurity, e) CICAndMal2017  dataset which encompasses trustworthy and malware applications and f) the Android Validation dataset which captures  accurately the relationships existing between various applications from a Cybersecurity point of view.  32 For a more detailed list of threats, see ENISA AI threat landscape available at  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/artificial-intelligence-cybersecurity-challenges/@@download/fullReport  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/artificial-intelligence-cybersecurity-challenges/@@download/fullReport  RESEARCH AND INNOVATION BRIEF  Final | 1.0 | TLP-G | May 2022  18  4. COMPUTATIONAL  SECURITY  Computational security is a large and emerging area of research that is heavily influenced by  our increasing reliance on communication technologies. The security of the processing systems  that stitch together our increasingly hyperconnected world is dependent on processors and the  way in which they process data.  Computational security encompasses issues of hardware security and cryptography. Hardware  security for protecting data and applications even from attacks by privileged users, such as  cloud providers or system administrators, is becoming increasingly important, as evidenced by  famous security breaches, such as that of Verkada33 in March 2021. In this breach, access was  given to over 150,000 security camera feeds in various public and private locations.  One of the most important debates in cryptography research is the extent to which it could be  seriously affected by the potential of quantum information processing, since the security of most  cryptographic primitives in use today relies on the hardness of computational problems that can  be easily broken by adversaries who have access to a quantum computer. Some of the  identified challenges include the following.  • The design and standardisation of new public key systems: in the Post Quantum  era, all popular public key solutions will be broken and new systems must be designed  based on problems that are conjectured to remain hard in the quantum computational  model. These mathematical problems must be studied well and extensively evaluated  against quantum algorithms.  • The design and standardisation of new symmetric key systems: while public-key  schemes will be broken, it seems that symmetric key cryptography is significantly less  affected. The impact of Grover's quantum algorithm can be compensated by just  doubling the key size in order to achieve the desired level of security. However, it  doesn't mean that it will be just another day in crypto paradise. Doubling the key size  has a significant impact on the performance of the cryptographic module and in some  cases using them will be prohibitive.  4.1 SUSTAINABLE CRYPTOGRAPHY  The catastrophic impact that quantum computing is expected to have on cryptography and  cybersecurity in general proves that the pursuit of security is a marathon race that requires  constant effort and awareness.  Research for new cryptographic primitives, algorithms and protocols must be a never- ending task.  Some of the identified challenges include:  • Quantum Cryptography: this is a significant paradigm-shift because security in the  area of cryptographics is based on physics. More precisely, quantum cryptography  covers a vast range of cryptographic algorithms that are based on theories of quantum  mechanics. Quantum key distribution is the most well-known application of quantum  33 https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-09/hackers-expose-tesla-jails-in-breach-of-150-000-security-cams,  last accessed November 2021  https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-09/hackers-expose-tesla-jails-in-breach-of-150-000-security-cams  RESEARCH AND INNOVATION BRIEF  Final | 1.0 | TLP-G | May 2022  19  cryptography as it has reached production phase. However, it is still hard to scale and  the security of the scheme, though unconditionally secure in theory, is subject to  several assumptions in practice.  • New mathematical problems: since the introduction of the public key paradigm in the  middle 1970s, several mathematical problems have been proposed to be used in  public key schemes. However, the public key technologies have been dominated by  two main hard mathematical problems, the factorisation of integers and variants (field,  elliptic curve) of the discrete logarithm problem. The expected implementation of  quantum computing has forced the cryptographic community to invest its research  efforts in new problems or to revisit old ones that did not gain sufficient attention over  the last four decades.  4.2 PRIVACY PRESERVING BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGIES  Blockchain technology offers the possibility of implementing a public digital ledger of  transactions. The main security feature of this structure is that it allows append-only operations  with cryptographic guarantee, i.e. the security of a cryptographic hash function protects the  integrity of the structure. The technology has been widely adopted in many applications and  offers users the ability to deal directly with each other without an intermediary.  Cryptocurrencies and finance in general are the sectors that have recognised the importance of  such a technology and the areas in which the technology has proven its power. However,  several improvements are in order and user's privacy has been identified as one of the most  important among them. While the main goal of blockchain-based cryptocurrencies is  transparency, in many situations individuals or companies want to protect the privacy of the  information surrounding a transaction. After all, finances and transactions are generally held to  be private information. Some of the challenges identified include the following.  • Verifiable computation: the scope of verifiable computation (VC) is to verify the  output of an outsourced operation. The client wants to outsource the computation of  some function to an untrusted machine and be assured that the computed outputs are  correct. The client aims for efficiency and integrity. One of the main application areas is  cloud computing, as cloud data processing results may be incorrect and cannot always  be trusted.  • Standardisation of ZKP schemes: every year several new schemes appear  improving previous works or introducing new properties. The ZKP schemes come into  various flavours and each one is tailored to a specific use case. For the moment, it  does not seem that there is one scheme to rule them all. It is clear from the plethora  and variety of schemes that a clarification of the field is required. Guidelines are  needed to facilitate the selection of the optimal ZKP scheme for each use case34.  4.3 ENHANCED PRIVACY - USER CONTROLLED ENCRYPTION  There is an ongoing debate regarding encryption and its effect on the ability of law enforcement  to access data. While there is no silver bullet that can solve the problem, the discussion  regarding encryption policy or, even better, user-controlled encryption remains alive. EU  Member States are asked to find a balance between ‘security through encryption and despite  encryption’. Legally, EU-wide legislation on strong encryption is identified as a possible  measure to ensure the security of human rights. Some of the challenges identified are shown  below.  • Privacy preserving market: EU Member States must find a balance between privacy  and the prevention of criminal activity. They are invited to protect both privacy and the  34 In 2018, actors from the industry and academia jointly formed the ZKProof standardisation effort. The main goal is to  ‘standardise the use of cryptographic zero-knowledge proofs’. To this day, it is still an on-going effort.  RESEARCH AND INNOVATION BRIEF  Final | 1.0 | TLP-G | May 2022  20  legal rights of EU citizens and EU market clients. The challenge is both technical and  regulative in nature. From the technical point of view, several issues must be resolved,  i.e. key management and data access control.  4.4 HARDWARE-ASSISTED SECURITY  Even the most secure algorithm is vulnerable if the computing environment where it is executed  is not adequately protected. Effective protection mechanisms must be provided throughout the  data cycle, i.e. data must be handled securely at all times and in all locations. This results in  stringent requirements for confidentiality and integrity, not only when data is ‘in transfer’ (e.g.  when it is exchanged over a network connection) or ‘at rest’ (e.g. when it is stored on a disk) but  also when it is ‘in use’ (e.g. it is loaded in RAM or in the CPU for executing a computation).  While protection of data in transfer and at rest is relatively easy to achieve, protection of  data in use is still - to a large extent - an open issue.  Hardware-assisted security does not mean hardware security. The term hardware security  refers to the protection of physical systems from harm, not to the protection of software which  runs on the hardware of a computer system. In hardware-assisted security instead, features of  the hardware are used to support software security, typically by means of Trusted Computing  (TC) features. A key concept of TC is the chain of trust. A chain of trust is established by  validating each component of hardware and software from the end entity up to the root of trust.  Some generally agreed upon features of TC include trusted boot, sealed storage, curtained  memory, attestation, integrity measurement and secure I/O.  Trusted Execution Environment technologies (TEE) provide an application-layer designed for  security aware developers, who partition their application into security critical parts (which are  executed in processor-hardened enclaves and/or protected memory areas) and non-critical  parts (which are executed normally).  TEE has received great attention from developers,  software vendors and original equipment manufacturers (OEM) and software ecosystem  partners. What makes TEE attractive is its capability to provide protection for the integrity and  confidentiality of data-in-use, even against super-privileged software and users. Notably, not  only is this effective against malware but it also removes the need for trusting third parties, such  as the system administrator or the cloud provider.  4.5 PRIVACY PRESERVING AI  AI inference systems are expected to become an integral part of the vast majority of modern  systems deployed and operating in the cloud, on the core network and on devices. Both the  training and prediction phases of AI models pose new risks to client privacy. Many AI models  are optimised by embedding their clients' preferences into the training data, while even the raw  training data may contain private information (gender, location, religion, political views). In the  inference phase, the client's inputs are used unprotected, while in several cases even the AI  model and its coefficients (e.g. weights and biases, architecture) require IP protection. It is no  surprise that the protection of privacy has been identified by the industry as one of the key  factors for the wide adoption of ML inference technology35. The list below identifies the main  areas in the research of privacy in AI.  1. Practical fully homomorphic encryption: homomorphic encryption (HE) is a form of  encryption that permits users to perform computations on encrypted data without first  decrypting it. The problem has been studied for the last four decades and an FHE solution  was first proposed in 2009. Since then, more and more promising schemes have been  proposed.  2. Multi-party computation: in secure multi-party computation (MPC) cryptography, multiple  participants can correctly execute a computation together without revealing their respective  35 https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.04449, last accessed November 2021.  https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.04449  RESEARCH AND INNOVATION BRIEF  Final | 1.0 | TLP-G | May 2022  21  inputs. The field was introduced in the early 1980s, and since then a lot of theoretical work  has been done.  3. Standardisation: an open consortium of industry, government and academia to  standardise homomorphic encryption exists36. The standardisation effort aims to facilitate  the adaption of the HE technology and to present the security properties of the  standardised scheme(s) in a clear and understandable form. All the schemes that have  been proposed for standardisation so far belong in the second category. Besides the fact  that the field of MPC protocols is more mature than HE, the standardisation effort is very  limited.  4. Hardware implementation: in the last decade, the performance of HE schemes has  impressively improved up to five orders of magnitude thanks to advances in the theory and  to more efficient implementations. Despite the impressive improvements that took place  during the last decade, both MPC protocols and HE schemes impose significant  computational overhead that cannot be ignored. Hardware implementation of the  complicated operations and large operands seems to be the solution for efficient MPC and  HE modules.  5. Compilers: realising HE or MPC based computations is complex for the non-expert, there  has been huge progress in the last decade and several compilers have been introduced  that produce efficient protocols. In order to facilitate the work of developers, HE compilers  have been proposed to offer high-level abstraction.  Possible research focus:  • Quantum resilient or safe and efficient public key schemes;  • Efficient implementations of symmetric key schemes that possess a higher level of security;  • Standards for new quantum resilient/safe algorithms and protocols;  • Planning and preparation for the transition to the Post Quantum era of cryptographic systems;  • Hardware assisted security, more specifically on CPU technology, transparent application support and the  combined use of Trusted Execution Environment technologies and Homomorphic Encryption (HE);  • Compilers that produce efficient and secure multi-party computation (MPC) and HE protected code;  • Standardisation of HE schemes and MPC protocols;  • Hardware acceleration of MPC protocols and HE schemes;  • New assumptions and impossibility results that derive from mathematics, physics or hardware limitations,  as a basis for future cryptography;  • Secure implementations of cryptographic systems that resist side channel attacks.  36 www.homomorphicencryption.org, accessed November 2021.  http://www.homomorphicencryption.org/  RESEARCH AND INNOVATION BRIEF  Final | 1.0 | TLP-G | May 2022  22  5. CYBERSECURITY IN LIFE  SCIENCES  (BIOTECHNOLOGY)  Governments and security experts have identified the life sciences sector as particularly  vulnerable to cybercrime. The importance of reviewing cybersecurity related issues in life  sciences, and in biotechnology in particular, is no different from many other critical  infrastructures (e.g. the chemical industry, nuclear physics, etc.). However, the lack of  awareness and of specific cybersecurity controls to address the risks and the long term  implications that may have implications for life itself lends a sense of urgency to the need to  review this topic from a research perspective.  When it comes to cybersecurity, innovation is quickly becoming a double-edged sword for life  sciences customers. Recently, a cybersecurity researcher uncovered37 the threat posed by two  Advance Persistent Threat (APT) groups that gained access to a leading pharmaceutical  company's environment for up to three years before being discovered. They stole IP and  business data from the victim, information on bio culture products, cost reports and other details  related to the company's overseas operations. There is nothing more important to a  pharmaceutical company than the formula for one of its new drugs.  5.1 THE URGENCY OF CYBERBIOSECURITY  Most broadly, cyberbiosecurity aims to identify and mitigate security risks fostered by the  digitisation of biology and the automation of biotechnology. What exactly is meant by this needs  to be explained further. Cyberbiosecurity was first defined38 as understanding the vulnerabilities  to unwanted surveillance, intrusions, and malicious and harmful activities which can occur  within or at the interfaces of commingled life and medical sciences, cyber-physical dimension,  supply chain and infrastructure systems, and developing and instituting measures to prevent,  protect against, mitigate, investigate and attribute such threats as they pertain to security,  competitiveness and resilience. We have reached new milestones in our understanding of how  biological systems work and have also found ways to manipulate these systems to our  advantage or needs in meaningful ways. Biotech tools such as gene editing can intentionally  introduce heritable genetic traits into wild populations, offering a new way to escape certain  vector-borne diseases.  Several areas in Biotech are of particular concern for cyberbiosecurity. Gene editing tools such  as CRISPR-CAS939 (Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats associated  protein-9 nuclease) for example, are used worldwide for rapid and precise gene editing.  Researchers like to use computers to analyse Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA)40, operate lab  machines and store genetic information. In healthcare, the digitisation of biology and metabolic  engineering is accelerating the development of new vaccines, drugs and painkillers. Agriculture  is becoming smarter and digital, with farmers relying on data-driven decisions gained from  37 https://www.darkreading.com/threat-intelligence/state-sponsored-cyberattacks-target-medical-research, last accessed  November 2021.  38 Randall S Murch, William K So, Wallace G Buchholz, Sanjay Raman, and Jean Peccoud. Cyberbiosecurity: An emerging  new discipline to help safeguard the bioeconomy.

But these new possibilities also bring a whole new category of vulnerabilities and risks.  In the last five years, the technological barriers to acquiring and using biological weapons have  been significantly lowered. The security implications of biotechnological advances extend  beyond bioweapons. For example, developments in metabolic pathway engineering also offer  ways to produce illicit drugs such as heroin. Scientists have already figured out how to make  the active ingredients in other narcotics, such as cannabis and precursors to Lysergic acid  diethylamide (LSD). What if a terrorist group or despotic regime tries to spread modified  organisms aimed at attacking troops, scaring civilians, or throwing food production into  disarray?  Recently, researchers outlined in a study41 the risks of using gene sequencing technologies to  corrupt databases by altering sequences or annotations. In this article, computer scientists  designed a DNA sample that, when sequenced, resulted in a file that allowed the hacker to  remotely control the sequencing computer and make changes to DNA sequences. These  changes could delay a research program, resulting in capital and labour losses, or could be  used in a terrorist act to produce toxins or infectious agents in an uncontrolled manner. To  mitigate these risks, the culture of the life sciences community must change from blind trust to a  highly aware and educated community. This also requires intricate relationships between the  computational and experimental dimensions of product development workflows.  The multiplicity of pathogens and toxins with their potential to be used as bioweapons (BW)  agents42 could be due to several factors. These include infectivity (the number of organisms  required to cause disease), virulence (the severity of the disease caused), transmissibility (the  ease of spread from person to person) and incubation time (the time from exposure to a  biological agent to a disease outbreak). All these attributes are manageable by modern  biotechnology, and information about such experimental series is key to any covert attack that  uses them as bioweapons.  Similarly, in cyberspace, there are a variety of malicious codes. These include viruses  (programs that replicate in target machines); worms (self-sustaining programs); and carriers  such as a Trojan horse that perform a legitimate function combined with malicious activity.  Additionally, botnets or networks of computers infected with malicious code can be coordinated  to perform distributed denial-of-service attacks.  For biological weapons, means of delivery range from advanced aerial spraying to  contamination of food or water, while malicious code can be transmitted in cyberspace through  user portals, email, web browsers, chat clients, web-enabled applications, and updates. The  cyberthreat has expanded dramatically in recent years through a series of damaging incidents.  Bioinformatics software is still not hardened against cyberattacks. There is a need to promote  the widespread adoption of standard software best practices for security, such as input  sanitisation, use of memory-safe languages or bounds checking on buffers and regular security  audits. Patching remains a challenge because analytics software often resides in individually  managed repositories and is not regularly updated.  41 Randall S Murch, William K So, Wallace G Buchholz, Sanjay Raman, and Jean Peccoud. Cyberbiosecurity: An emerging  new discipline to help safeguard the bioeconomy. Frontiers in bioengineering and biotechnology, 6:39, 2018.  42 Biological weapons are microorganisms like virus, bacteria, fungi or other toxins that are produced and released  deliberately to cause disease and death in humans, animals or plants, WHO (https://www.who.int/health-topics/biological- weapons#tab=tab_1).  RESEARCH AND INNOVATION BRIEF  Final | 1.0 | TLP-G | May 2022  24  5.2 A MAPPING OF KNOWN CYBERBIOSECURITY CHALLENGES AND  EXISTING GAPS  Exploitable technology and a range of (still under-assessed) attack vectors include (a)  databases (including genomic, list of dangerous genes or organisms), design-build-test libraries  and rules, simulations, test data, sample records, (b) individual personal computers, lab  equipment and processes, mission-critical devices and hardware (e.g. assemblers,  synthesisers, sensors), (c) mission-critical software (e.g. workflow controls, process controls),  (d) local and remote networks, and (e) raw materials, supplies and actual biomatter43.  Notably, many of the devices used throughout the biotech sector are portable, and most are  connected to the internet. Challenges arise not only at the level of application but even during  research as well as at the design, build and test level.  Thanks to the inherent vast variation in nature, biological processes are difficult to grasp.  Computerised or automated results (e.g. molecular diagnostic tests) are next to impossible to  verify with the naked eye. Yet more traditional tests and processes throughout the life-science  fields have been replaced by computer technology. Practical skill and hands-on experience are  no longer the focus. Furthermore, more credence is often given to a computerised output (e.g.  in diagnostics) than to clinical observations. While biological or medical decision making was  traditionally based on consensus and expert opinion, computer simulations or automated  processes could easily be distorted and manufactured without anyone being able to tell the  difference. Examples of known attacks show how easy it is to compromise sensors and  protocols and to, for example, achieve misdiagnosis of skin cancer, referable diabetic  retinopathy and pneumonia by automated processes.  5.3 A LARGELY UNRECOGNISED BIOTECH THREAT LANDSCAPE  The most studied cyberbiosecurity danger probably involves pathogenic databases. Several  studies have shown extensive cybersecurity vulnerabilities which are exacerbated by the  human interface (errors and social engineering attacks). The danger is not only that bad actors  could ‘create’ dangerous microorganisms from unsecured digital information. Just as  concerning is the fact that erroneous or manipulated data can compromise international  research activities and public health responses during outbreaks of disease (e.g. when trying to  understand, model and detect new pathogens).  More generally, cyberbiosecurity vulnerabilities can lead to disruption of CIA44 at all levels  (including biosynthetic pathways and processes, software, hardware, mission-critical devises  etc.) and scales (from biological processes at the molecular level to genetically-modified plants,  microbes or animals). Notably, as biotech is only able to work with small biological snippets  (e.g. ‘marker genes’ or ‘DNA signatures’, which are believed to represent the whole organism),  establishing genuine ‘integrity’ of biological entities or processes (e.g. genuine GMOs45 versus  illicit or manipulated ones) is in many cases technically impossible.  Impairment of the confidentiality of biologic data can, for example, leak pathogenic data. Illicit  access to, for example, synthetic processes or critical biomatter can result in the hazardous  distribution of biological agents with a potential global impact.  Making only manipulated devices or processes available can lead to erroneous medical  treatment or misdetection attacks - whereby the device or service could appear to be  functioning while it actually provides false results. For example, with modern sequencing  technologies, this could lead to false diagnostics. Such attacks could even have a global impact  when no other molecular tests are available, as is often the case with novel pathogens. On the  43 https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/biomatter, last accessed November 2021.  44 CIA - Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability.  45 Genetically Modified Organism.  https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/biomatter  RESEARCH AND INNOVATION BRIEF  Final | 1.0 | TLP-G | May 2022  25  other hand, lack of availability (including supply chain attacks) can result in shortages of drugs,  medical supplies, food, knowledge and others.  Questions pointing to research needs and priorities in the context of cyberbiosecurity:  • What is the level of exploitability of biotechnology R&D?  • Which attack vectors could compromise biotechnology R&D?  • What are the most critical digital assets used in biotechnology?  Possible research focus:  • The evolving risks and the threat landscape in biotechnology R&D;  • Risk management framework in the field of public health microbiology (e.g. modern DNA sequencing);  • Categories of cyberbiosecurity vulnerabilities (i.e. distinguishing the more traditional ones from those that  are outside existing methodologies);  • Identification of the processes and routines throughout the life science fields that require interfaces and  reliance on automation.  RESEARCH AND INNOVATION BRIEF  Final | 1.0 | TLP-G | May 2022  26  6. INTERDISCIPLINARITY IN  THE RESEARCH OF CORE  FIELDS  Many common research challenges as well as gaps emerge across all four themes outlined in  this paper (intelligent systems, cyberbiosecurity, computational security and hyperconnected  world).  Key issues focus on the interdisciplinarity of researchers in core areas, and the incorporation (or  reinforcement) of basic cybersecurity principles such as privacy, confidentiality and  trustworthiness. Trust is also a theme that runs through all the major research themes.  Skills, education and awareness in all areas are mentioned in each of the research themes.  New and emerging technologies provide opportunities not only for innovation (societal and  market) but also for abuse. Education and awareness of the potential misuse of these  technological developments must also focus on providing developers and users with the most  appropriate skills.  Many stakeholders are involved in all four research themes, which are identified as crucial  areas that will have an impact on the resilience of our societies. These research themes should  not be interpreted as silos for independent research. Given the nature of the research  challenges, collaboration between the various stakeholders is required, and this needs to be  addressed at a fundamental level in understanding the interactions between technical, political,  societal and economic approaches in these areas. One way is to ensure that this is done with  multidisciplinary teams representing different stakeholders. All these research themes involve  stakeholders at different stages of theory building, conceptualisation, development and  production and should therefore all be integrated into research and innovation activities.  6.1 CONVERGENCE OF AI WITH OTHER EMERGING TRENDS  As the digital ecosystem continues to expand with the Internet-of-Things (IoT) and other  devices connecting individuals, organisations and value chains via mobile phones, central  systems, data centres and also airborne devices, AI can be seen as both a key driver and the  underlying technology in several areas (without claiming to be exhaustive) such as, among  others, next generation mobile telecommunications, computer security and biotechnology (e.g.  cyber biosecurity and synthetic biology).  The development of 6G is expected to reach technological maturity and standardisation over  the next decade, impacting how people interact with the digital world beyond 2030. 6G will go  beyond mobile internet to support ubiquitous AI services from the core to the network terminals.  In fact, 6G can be expected to be ‘AI-enabled’ in the sense that it will both rely on AI for its core  physical layer function and enable a wide range of new AI-based applications.  AI will play a critical role in the development and optimisation of 6G architectures, protocols and  operations. At the same time, AI will be increasingly necessary for the IoT, either to run some  local and relatively closed systems or to monitor the value of the global ecosystem with many  more or less open systems over the Internet, in a cloud or at the edge. AI is undoubtedly an  excellent set of tools to mitigate IoT risks, whether by investigating vulnerabilities, anticipating  RESEARCH AND INNOVATION BRIEF  Final | 1.0 | TLP-G | May 2022  27  problems (or even predicting them through self-reporting capabilities), controlling cross-network  issues, orchestrating traffic and flows, and more generally, the risks of threats.  Cryptography is the foundation of computer security and one of the most important  research areas in cybersecurity. One of the most important discussions in cryptography  research is how it could be seriously affected by the potential of quantum information  processing.  The increasing convergence of biotechnology and AI is also an emerging area to exploit. The  ability to collect and process enormous amounts of data, which underpins AI, machine learning  and deep learning, combined with advances in biotechnology such as gene editing, DNA  sequencing and synthesis, is leading to a leap forward at the heart of the next industrial  revolution. Precision medicine, enhanced bio surveillance46, synthetic biology are all  technologies that will increasingly benefit from the intersection of these two fields. Some  advances being made in the bio-AI synergy may also raise ethical concerns.  In addition to the above, a space for discussions on the perspectives of societal challenges for  the abovementioned research themes needs to be created. These 'perspectives' will  continuously engage with the present, critically assessing our design, use, and adoption of  technology, rather than just looking through technologically-determined lenses toward the  future.  Possible research focus:  • Build systematic anticipatory capacities e.g. launch multidisciplinary Delphi surveys to address key  challenges as they emerge and as they can be anticipated;  • Adopt a ‘broad eye’ lens for AI as the ecosystems we are evoking are constantly expanding, for  example cybersecurity and AI, in the age of quantum cryptography;  • Design roadmaps involving AI capacities for, for example, cryptographic or cyberbiosecurity challenges  over the next 10-15 years.  46 Biosurveillance is an aspect of biodefense relating to the detection of biological threats, including bioterrorist threats,  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biosurveillance, last accessed November 2021.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biosurveillance  RESEARCH AND INNOVATION BRIEF  Final | 1.0 | TLP-G | May 2022  28  7. CLOSING REMARKS AND  NEXT STEPS  This document highlights some of the key R&I needs and priorities identified by ENISA in  consultation with the expert community. The four suggested themes for this year encompass  some of the key trends identified by ENISA for the next 10 to 20 years. It invites researchers  and industry to develop their knowledge on key challenges by identifying the aspects that will  result from a decade of investment in the digitisation of the economy and society in Europe.  Addressing some of the challenges raises some concerns and requires a strong position and  commitment from policy makers and researchers to include them in the R&D programmes and  roadmaps.  Although Europe is at the forefront as a global contributor to R&I, there are several challenges  that need to be addressed, which are highlighted in this report. The first concerns  interdisciplinarity, where excellent research is conducted in disciplinary silos. The second is  linking basic research in advanced and niche areas with broader implementation initiatives,  which are evident in EU funding instruments and beyond. The third is the organisation and  coordination of research efforts in a global context.  The main objective of this document is to serve as a compass for ENISA to advise different  stakeholders, including the EU Commission, the ECCC47 Governing Board and Member States,  on these important requirements for cybersecurity R&I. This document is only a brief overview  of the first edition of the annual report, which summarises the main challenges and research  opportunities in the field of cybersecurity.  During the upcoming years, ENISA will publish separate reports assessing these topics  individually to provide more contextual and technical information on the challenges and  research needs outlined in this report. In parallel, ENISA will continue to engage with  stakeholders and the research community to discuss these and other topics relevant to  cybersecurity. The topics will be identified beforehand from a foresight exercise to be conducted  with stakeholders and the community. The results of these discussions will be reviewed and  described in the form of an annual brief to be published towards the end of the year.  47 https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/cybersecurity-competence-centre, last accessed November 2021.  https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/cybersecurity-competence-centre  ABOUT ENISA  The European Union Agency for Cybersecurity, ENISA, is the Union’s agency dedicated to  achieving a high common level of cybersecurity across Europe.

While Europe and the world recover from a public health crisis, it is vitally  important to identify future challenges and opportunities.  This decade, the EU will increase investment in research and innovation (R&I)1. One of the  focus areas will be the digital transformation of the economy and society that works for people  by promoting the European way of life, supporting democracy and values, and protecting its  strategic autonomy. In this context, the work of the research community is crucial in creating the  knowledge necessary to understand what lies ahead. The EU is a strong player in knowledge  and innovation: it accounts for almost 20% of global research and development, publishing and  patenting activities2.  This document offers a forward-looking perspective on some of these challenges and  opportunities. It recognises the importance of key structural trends with major implications for  the EU's digital ambitions to 2030 and beyond. The multidisciplinary nature of these trends led  to the selection of four main themes that form the structure adopted for this report:  hyperconnected world, intelligent systems3, cybersecurity in life sciences  (biotechnology), and computational security.  Digital hyperconnectivity4 is a trigger for all other trends and is independent of any particular  technology. Ubiquitous connectivity will increase the convergence of industries, products,  technologies and services, driven by the accelerated datafication5 of everything. The growing  appetite for data will help make technology smarter as the next frontrunner in the race for  greater automation and optimisation in everyday life. In addition, hyperconnectivity, datafication  and intelligent automation6 also contribute to research in the life sciences. This decade, as a  result of the pandemic and the efficiency of biotechnology, the EU will increase investment in  the research and development of new technologies for the pharmaceutical and health sectors7.  However, hyperconnectivity and intelligent automation do not come without challenges. While  the benefits are well known, the challenges and risks are yet to be fully recognised.  Cybersecurity is crucial to ensure that EU citizens, businesses and organisations can enjoy the  1 https://european-union.europa.eu/priorities-and-actions/actions-topic/research-and-innovation_en, last accessed  November 2021.  2 https://ec.europa.eu/info/publications/science-research-and-innovation-performance-eu-2020_en, last accessed  November 2021.  3 Although they are not the same (intelligent systems could also include AI-based software systems), for simplicity, in the  context of this paper we are using the two terms interchangeably.  4 The term refers to the use of multiple means of communication, such as email, instant messaging, telephone, face-to-face  contact and Web 2.0 information services.

INTRODUCTION  1.1 OBJECTIVES, METHODOLOGY AND TARGET AUDIENCE  The main objective of this document is to identify areas of cybersecurity R&I that are critical to  the EU's strategy and ambitions for the digital decade. The report is intended to fulfil ENISA's  mandate9 to advise EU institutions, bodies, offices and agencies, as well as Member States, on  new and future research needs and priorities. The information contained in this document will  be further developed to help identify funding priorities for future work programmes of the  European Cybersecurity Competence Centre and National Coordination Centres.  The four research topics explored in this document were selected primarily through consultation  with stakeholders and members of the research community. From a methodological  perspective, ENISA would select these topics mainly from trends identified in an annual  foresight exercise. However, exceptionally this year and since the ENISA foresight team was  taking its first steps, the topics were discussed with stakeholders and agreed internally.  The selected research topics are not exhaustive of all areas where cybersecurity research is  needed. They are the culmination of several smaller desktop research activities and  consultations with experts carried out during 2021. The work presented here is the consolidated  and highly condensed result of several interactions between ENISA members and experts from  the research community.  In the first phase, experts were asked to provide input on their research topics, from which a  general overview of the cybersecurity research and policy landscape was compiled. This input  took the form of written contributions from each expert. In these contributions, the experts  outlined key areas for further research in their respective fields. These documents were then  consolidated and served as inspiration for a workshop that took place in October 2021. During  this workshop, each research topic was discussed and an attempt was made to find a common  thread for R&I. This document is based on the contributions and results of this workshop.  This report is targeted at stakeholders involved in the research and innovation area from EU  Institutions, Bodies, Agencies, Member States and the wider cybersecurity research community.  This report may be especially relevant for:  • members from the eu and national entities involved in funding programmes for  research,  • policymakers,  • academics, researchers and R&D actors from the cybersecurity industry.  1.2 EU POLICY CONTEXT  In 2020, the President of the European Commission declared that ‘we are living in Europe’s  Digital Decade’10. At the end of 2020, the European Commission and the High Representative  presented a Joint Communication on ‘The EU’s Cybersecurity Strategy for the Digital  Decade’11. With these guiding documents, the EU is showing that it is proactively reacting to  9 Article 11 of the Cybersecurity Act, https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/cybersecurity-act, last accessed  November 2021.  10 European Commission, ‘COMMISSION STAFF WORKING DOCUMENT Accompanying the Document Proposal for a  Decision of the European Parliament and of the Council Establishing the 2030 Policy Programme 'Path to the Digital  Decade'’.  11 https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/ALL/?uri=JOIN:2020:18:FIN, last accessed November 2021.  https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/cybersecurity-act https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/ALL/?uri=JOIN:2020:18:FIN  RESEARCH AND INNOVATION BRIEF  Final | 1.0 | TLP-G | May 2022  8  the global challenges posed by cyberthreats and presenting the EU as an actor that is aware of  the challenges that have to be faced in the forthcoming years.  The EU is fulfilling this role in several ways. Firstly, it is seeking to take a leading role in shaping  the global rules for the use of technology and has been doing so for a long time12. It seeks,  wherever possible, to build global consensus on the tools and mechanisms for developing safe  and resilient technologies. The EU works with partners, both state and non-state actors, to build  a coherent and trusted framework for cooperation.  Secondly, the EU has developed a discourse of ‘open strategic autonomy’ that seeks to develop  a coherent EU-wide narrative for developing EU-level capabilities to respond to threats in the  world. Thirdly, the EU policy toolkit which will be focused on the NIS Directive13 (currently under  revision), the Cybersecurity Act (2019) and the forthcoming Cybersecurity Resilience and  Semiconductor Acts14, is due to be proposed in 2022. The European Council has also called for  a Join Cyber Unit15 to further develop the EU's cybersecurity toolkit.  Fourthly, and crucially for the aims of this report, the EU is investing in cybersecurity research  and development. The recently established ECCC demonstrates the commitment to this area in  a European policy and research context. This includes the development of technological  solutions and tools that enable an effective response to current and future risks and  cyberthreats. These include new and emerging information and communication technologies  and are designed to effectively deploy risk prevention technologies.  Despite the efforts described above, the security of cyberspace will continue to be an ongoing  project. Enormous efforts have been made to develop initiatives that support the development  of competences in this area. However, the opportunity and need to diversify the cybersecurity  R&I agenda is evident. The effort required to continue to meet the standard missions of  government agencies is creating a paradigm shift in the sense that cybersecurity risks and  threats are not limited to areas outside of government security. Nor do traditional systems of  policymaking apply in our hyperconnected world. Therefore, an approach that crosses the  different silos of R&I is needed.  12 European Commission and European External Action Service, ‘Cybersecurity Strategy’.  13 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/nis-directive, last accessed November 2021.  14 https://www.europarl.europa.eu/legislative-train/theme-a-europe-fit-for-the-digital-age/file-european-cyber-resilience-act,  last accessed November 2021.  15 https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/joint-cyber-unit, last accessed November 2021.  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/nis-directive https://www.europarl.europa.eu/legislative-train/theme-a-europe-fit-for-the-digital-age/file-european-cyber-resilience-act https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/joint-cyber-unit  RESEARCH AND INNOVATION BRIEF  Final | 1.0 | TLP-G | May 2022  9  1.3 THE EU CYBERSECURITY RESEARCH LANDSCAPE  Figure 1: Google Ngram of the term\"cybersecurity\" 1995-2021  Cybersecurity R&I is a crucial aspect of research in a number of policy domains. The  emergence of this field, witnessed by the exponential growth of literature in the field since  around 2013 (with the so-called Snowden revelations), indicates that ‘cybersecurity’ as a term  has emerged in contemporary discourse.  The EU and European research funding agencies contribute a large number of resources to  research in the field of cybersecurity. Efforts are driven across a number of agencies, and  through a number of different instruments. In a research field that encompasses so many policy  fields, the pluralism inherent in the funding and organisational structures is to be expected, and  even welcomed. But they are not the world’s leading funding agencies for published research in  the field by far.  Figure 2 identifies the funding provided by different bodies for research in the field of  cybersecurity that has been indexed in the Web of Knowledge (i.e. peer reviewed papers in  scientific journals). This clearly shows that US research funding agencies dominate the field,  with around 43% of published research in this broad field being supported by public funding  from the US government. More recent data, considering only the most cited papers from 2021  and 2022 (pre-prints), shows that European researchers are now emerging in this field, with  universities like the Technical University of Delft, Aarhus University, and several universities in  Spain generating research output that is being cited by the cybersecurity community.  RESEARCH AND INNOVATION BRIEF  Final | 1.0 | TLP-G | May 2022  10  1.4 MAPPING THE LANDSCAPE  Figure 2: Sources of funding for research in the field of cybersecurity (Source: Web of  Science)  Figure 2 depicts the investment in cybersecurity research from region to region. The European  Cybersecurity Atlas16 highlights the focus of some 750 research centres working on  cybersecurity issues in the EU. In terms of education and training, ENISA's own database on  cybersecurity in higher education, CYBERHEAD17, presents well over 100 educational  programmes in almost all EU and EFTA Member States. These programmes point to the  growing need to develop holistic approaches to dealing with the security threats and risks  associated with the increasing importance and emergence of new hyperconnected technologies  that are shaping our world. At the same time, many institutes are focusing on the technological  expertise needed to be at the forefront of research worldwide. In the European Union, there are  a number of projects, initiatives and networks that promote the field of cybersecurity in the EU.  The 2017 Cybersecurity Literacy Survey18 conducted by DG JRC in collaboration with DG  CNECT relied on a survey of over 600 people from European countries to analyse research  activities. This identified a large number of research centres and activities engaged in  cybersecurity research. This survey was accompanied by the development of a taxonomy of  cyberspace to support the categorisation of cyberspace competences. The European  Cybersecurity Taxonomy19 is a useful tool to facilitate the categorisation of the Union’s  cybersecurity competencies. Cybersecurity is inherently a cross-cutting topic, encompassing  many different research areas, academic disciplines and policy fields.  The cybersecurity research landscape is comprised of a wide range of different activities,  touching upon technical and social research, as well as policy in this sphere. Integration  between these strands of action needs to be addressed holistically in research in order to  16 https://cybersecurity-atlas.ec.europa.eu/centres-in-europe, last accessed November 2021.  17 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/cybersecurity-education/education-map/, last accessed November 2021.  18 https://ec.europa.eu/jrc/en/research-topic/cybersecurity/cybersecurity-competence-survey, last accessed November  2021.  19 https://publications.jrc.ec.europa.eu/repository/handle/JRC118089, last accessed November 2021.  https://cybersecurity-atlas.ec.europa.eu/centres-in-europe https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/cybersecurity-education/education-map/ https://publications.jrc.ec.europa.eu/repository/handle/JRC118089  RESEARCH AND INNOVATION BRIEF  Final | 1.0 | TLP-G | May 2022  11  ensure that outputs have the broadest impact. We need to build bridges between different  disciplines and stakeholders in order to ensure acceptance of and engagement with the  richness of the research landscape in cybersecurity in the EU.  RESEARCH AND INNOVATION BRIEF  Final | 1.0 | TLP-G | May 2022  12  2. A SECURE AND HUMAN- CENTRED  HYPERCONNECTED WORLD  The concept of a hyperconnected world is not defined by technology alone, but by the social,  economic and political implications it brings. The notion of hyperconnectivity was originally  defined by social scientists20 to refer to people in networked organisations and societies that are  constantly connected through a variety of digital means. Massive connectivity exists in many of  our digital environments and represents the interactions between various information systems,  data and many devices connected via the Internet. Recent discussions within certain  technology platforms and beyond talk about the emergence of a ‘metaverse’ as an approach to  understanding our relationship between immersive, data-driven environments and our daily  lives.  In computer networking, hyperconnectivity refers to all things communicating through a network,  encompassing person-to-person, person-to-machine and even machine-to-machine  communications. This will be possible with the massive increase in network coverage,  input/output communication (MIMO) and bandwidth. Current and future generations of mobile  communications such as 5G and 6G offer that possibility.  The introduction of 6G wireless communications is still about a decade away. Nonetheless, the  first discussions about new technologies and potential applications for this next generation have  already begun. Broadly speaking, the current question is whether 6G should be an  improvement on 5G in terms of core features, or whether it should go beyond existing coverage  into new areas, such as underwater and in space, or even at the molecular level.  Moreover, the increasing digitisation of business and society, with the advent of online  shopping, FinTech, cryptocurrencies, social media and many other transformative technologies,  are harnessing connectivity everywhere, all the time. With hyperconnectivity, the digital  economy and society will increasingly rely on the network to transform the way companies do  business and the way we all live.  With an increasingly connected digital economy and society, cybersecurity will also become  increasingly important. The frequency and sophistication of cyberthreats will continue to  challenge many individuals and organisations. Hyperconnectivity has increased the vulnerability  of connected individuals, institutions and nations. It represents a new challenge to humanity in  how it defines scale with hundreds of millions of connected individuals.  Multidisciplinary and future-oriented research will be required to facilitate the transition  to this inevitable hyperconnected world.  Foresight has an important role to play in providing early insights into the technological and  social changes that will shape this future, and in taking actions that will help define a desirable  and globally beneficial hyperconnected future. Cybersecurity research will lay the foundations  for building a trustworthy and reliable hyperconnected world.  20 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperconnectivity, last accessed November 2021.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperconnectivity  RESEARCH AND INNOVATION BRIEF  Final | 1.0 | TLP-G | May 2022  13  2.1 THE DATAFICATION OF EVERYTHING  The process of digitalisation - often referred to as digital transformation - is profoundly changing  our economy and society. It will continue affecting individuals, businesses and organisations  throughout this decade. The wake-up call for all the future research challenges and  opportunities described in this document occurs at a time of growing political awareness of  digital dependency in the economy and society.  The most noteworthy pattern in this digital transformation is the data-driven world we live in, a  world that will be always on, always tracking, always monitoring, always listening and always  watching – because it will be always learning. What we perceive to be randomness will be  bounded into patterns of normality by sophisticated algorithms that will take our data to deliver  the future in new and personalised ways. Data are often considered to be an asset but we see  that, in contemporary society, data are emerging as a space of contestation that goes beyond  the ‘data is the new oil’ debate, pushing us towards conceiving of data as the ‘new air’21.  An important discussion is how hyperconnectivity will the drive the datafication-of-everything  with the expansion of use cases, data collectors and data processors. The list below highlights  some of the challenges in the coming decades.  • The appetite for personal data: with hyperconnectivity, the opportunities for data  collection increase significantly. Among the most sensitive are personal identifiable  information and geolocation which, if breached or stolen, may cause severe impacts on  citizens’ privacy, the economy and society.  • A growing interest in surveillance of citizens: there is a general concern about the  increasing interest of private (corporate) and state-sponsored agents in the  surveillance of citizens and organisations. With hyperconnectivity and the growing  appetite for data, eavesdropping could become a major threat, compromising the  privacy and protection of users’ data.  • The use of technology to expand the risks affecting the fundamental rights of EU  citizens: the rapid increase in the use of artificial intelligence to explore data collected  and maintained by digital platforms may pose risks to the fundamental rights of  citizens. It may lead to infringements of privacy, data protection and equal treatment,  particularly when it comes to the growing use of Big Data through the rapid advances  in machine learning.  Questions pointing to research needs and priorities in the context of an hyperconnected world:  • What are the consequences for humanity in a hyperconnected world?  • How will hyperconnectivity affect the security of cyberspace?  • What are the conceptual frameworks required before transitioning to a hyperconnected world?  21 ‘Answering Europe’s Call: Storing and Processing EU Data in the EU’. 2021.

Possible research focus:  • The redefinition of boundaries of human-computer interaction, and the concomitant cyber risks that are  associated with this;  • Cybersecurity in the context of new generations of mobile communications and data collection or processing  methods (evolution from 5G to 6G).  RESEARCH AND INNOVATION BRIEF  Final | 1.0 | TLP-G | May 2022  15  3. THE AGE OF INTELLIGENT  SYSTEMS  Artificial intelligence (AI) is one of the most transformative forces of our time and key to the EU's  ambitions and strategy for the digital decade. The importance and expansion of its influence is  referenced in various parts of this document. AI will continue to transform the way businesses  and organisations work, manage data and interact with users through a blend of advanced  technologies, such as machine learning (ML), natural language processing (NLP) and cognitive  computing. There are still areas where more research and development is needed to promote  trustworthy and reliable AI that supports the rights of EU citizens and respects EU values.  In order to map the domain, defined by a complex and open-ended relation with cybersecurity,  we made a clear distinction between ‘AI used to harm’ and ‘AI used to protect’.  Potential offenders are highly innovative and may develop algorithms, solutions or procedures  that eventually become new standards in the cybercrime arena. Moreover, even a ‘secure and  trustworthy’ system may later be hijacked by a different actor with malicious intent.  Participants at the intersection of cybersecurity and AI often find themselves caught between  the creation of knowledge and market initiatives, such as academic research being mingled with  R&D in a more blurred way than usual, peer-reviewed literature coexisting with major players  involved in AI and cybersecurity issues on their own terms, major advisory agencies and  consultants (often former or active C-level executives), all contributing to the collective progress  of this research field.  AI in cybersecurity applications can be classified in the following categories: AI-powered  defence mechanisms, cyberthreats exploiting AI, attacks against AI-based security mechanisms  (mechanisms using AI to promptly detect, identify and accommodate the consequences of  cyberattacks) and defences for AI-based protection mechanisms (to secure and protect AI- based mechanisms from malicious attempts).  To lay the groundwork for this exploration, a case analysis has been conducted on two focus  areas that are of particular importance as they demonstrate a strong interdependence between  AI and cybersecurity issues.  3.1 AI TO IMPROVE CYBERSECURITY DEFENCES  A first research focus should be on using AI to improve cybersecurity defences. In this regard,  research should focus on common cybersecurity tasks, such as the prediction and prevention of  attacks, detection of threats and intrusion, response, planning and other areas, and in what  ways AI and ML tasks, techniques and methods can be applied to address them.  AI tools offer high performance at low cost and in real time. Areas of cybersecurity for which  AI/ML offer promising solutions include applications that require the processing of large  amounts of data. In particular AI/ML can automate threat detection (both known and emerging  threats), using pattern recognition and anomaly detection methods. AI approaches can be used  for spam, intrusion, and malware detection and classification. Support Vector Machine (SVM) is  one of the most prominent algorithms for anomaly detection and pattern recognition (malware,  RESEARCH AND INNOVATION BRIEF  Final | 1.0 | TLP-G | May 2022  16  spam, and intrusion detection22). Other algorithms have also been used for spam and intrusion  detection23. Ensemble methods, which combine multiple ML tools, have been used to detect  malware24 and intrusions25.  AI-based defences that use supervised and unsupervised approaches, as well as bio- inspired algorithms26 and auto-encoders, may prevent attacks such as Distributed Denial  of Service (DDoS), ransomware, zero-day attacks27.  In addition, AI-based systems may also predict the most vulnerable points of attack, enabling  operators to plan and allocate resources accordingly. In general, manual responses cannot  keep up with the increasing number of automated threats, and this is exactly where AI-based  solutions show great potential. However, the efficiency of such tools depends on the availability  and quality of data. In most cases, not all the necessary information is available to feed the  algorithms in advance, e.g. attack data within the proper context.  3.2 AI TO ORCHESTRATE CYBERATTACKS  A second research focus should be on protecting AI against its possible use to orchestrate  cyberattacks, as well as against attacks on AI-based mechanisms and tools28.  Attackers exploit  AI to increase the attack efficiency, discover vulnerable points of entry, identify previously  unknown weak points, automate the attack mechanism and extend its impact. Examples of  such attacks include malicious personalised tweets or Deep-Fakes29 using Generative  Adversarial Networks30 (GAN). AI can also be used to improve the efficiency of malware by  using, for example, reinforcement learning techniques.  Based on current assumptions, such as the availability of a vast amount of high-quality data and  stationarity over time, R&I efforts should focus on small data, end-to-end solutions and on  minimising the need for domain expertise. R&I should regularly assess the validity of the  developed model(s), be able to incorporate non-stationarities (i.e. changes in the time variance  of system states), carefully examine the available dataset to detect and eliminate existing  biases and imbalances, as well as develop standardised datasets, to reliably reproduce and  compare existing AI-based solutions.  22 Baigaltugs Sanjaa and Erdenebat Chuluun.

These cover a wide spectrum of cybersecurity applications and represent  real-world conditions to some extent.  AI tools and mechanisms are the attack points themselves, i.e. through their own vulnerabilities  in open-source software libraries, data poisoning (attacks that poison training data), adversarial  attacks based on GAN, as well as reverse-engineering of the trained model32.  Finally, there are a number of AI-specific requirements that are particularly relevant when  addressing cybersecurity applications. AI-based tools and methods should be verifiable,  reliable, explainable, robust against adversarial attacks, auditable and unbiased. At the same  time, to effectively address these requirements, AI should integrate multidisciplinary  perspectives such as socio-technical, economic, regulatory, cultural and cognitive points of  view.  Importantly, the work produced for this document identified existing gaps and provided  directions for future research that will ensure intelligent and effective deployment of AI as a tool  for increased cybersecurity.  Questions pointing to research needs and priorities in the context of intelligent systems:  • How to use AI to design intelligent defence solutions able to detect and identify attacks against systems,  networks and programs?  • How to understand the use of AI in orchestrating cyberattacks?  • What about the validation value chain that is particular to science and scientists? How can the work of  researchers be validated through different forms of publication, such as blogs, independent websites, relays  of big companies’ presentations, in other words, a huge debating grey literature, discussing a truly fast- changing reality?  Possible research focus:  • Development of a standardised performance evaluation framework;  • Design of approaches for the monitoring of large-scale and possibly interconnected systems;  • Exploration of biomimetic cybersecurity algorithms;  • Incorporation of the security-by-design concept (assess the security of the protection mechanisms against  a standardised framework considering diverse malicious attempts);  • Preservation of the privacy and confidentiality of the information flow;  • Inclusion of context awareness in ML in order to boost resiliency.  31 a) KDD Cup 99 and DEFCON serving research on intrusion detection and modelling, b) CTU-13 covering real botnet  traffic, c) Spambase and SMS Spam which are collections of SMSs and e-mails facilitating spam classification purposes, d)  CICIDS2017 providing full-packet traffic data recorded at the Canadian Institute for Cybersecurity, e) CICAndMal2017  dataset which encompasses trustworthy and malware applications and f) the Android Validation dataset which captures  accurately the relationships existing between various applications from a Cybersecurity point of view.  32 For a more detailed list of threats, see ENISA AI threat landscape available at  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/artificial-intelligence-cybersecurity-challenges/@@download/fullReport  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/artificial-intelligence-cybersecurity-challenges/@@download/fullReport  RESEARCH AND INNOVATION BRIEF  Final | 1.0 | TLP-G | May 2022  18  4. COMPUTATIONAL  SECURITY  Computational security is a large and emerging area of research that is heavily influenced by  our increasing reliance on communication technologies. The security of the processing systems  that stitch together our increasingly hyperconnected world is dependent on processors and the  way in which they process data.  Computational security encompasses issues of hardware security and cryptography. Hardware  security for protecting data and applications even from attacks by privileged users, such as  cloud providers or system administrators, is becoming increasingly important, as evidenced by  famous security breaches, such as that of Verkada33 in March 2021. In this breach, access was  given to over 150,000 security camera feeds in various public and private locations.  One of the most important debates in cryptography research is the extent to which it could be  seriously affected by the potential of quantum information processing, since the security of most  cryptographic primitives in use today relies on the hardness of computational problems that can  be easily broken by adversaries who have access to a quantum computer. Some of the  identified challenges include the following.  • The design and standardisation of new public key systems: in the Post Quantum  era, all popular public key solutions will be broken and new systems must be designed  based on problems that are conjectured to remain hard in the quantum computational  model. These mathematical problems must be studied well and extensively evaluated  against quantum algorithms.  • The design and standardisation of new symmetric key systems: while public-key  schemes will be broken, it seems that symmetric key cryptography is significantly less  affected. The impact of Grover's quantum algorithm can be compensated by just  doubling the key size in order to achieve the desired level of security. However, it  doesn't mean that it will be just another day in crypto paradise. Doubling the key size  has a significant impact on the performance of the cryptographic module and in some  cases using them will be prohibitive.  4.1 SUSTAINABLE CRYPTOGRAPHY  The catastrophic impact that quantum computing is expected to have on cryptography and  cybersecurity in general proves that the pursuit of security is a marathon race that requires  constant effort and awareness.  Research for new cryptographic primitives, algorithms and protocols must be a never- ending task.  Some of the identified challenges include:  • Quantum Cryptography: this is a significant paradigm-shift because security in the  area of cryptographics is based on physics. More precisely, quantum cryptography  covers a vast range of cryptographic algorithms that are based on theories of quantum  mechanics. Quantum key distribution is the most well-known application of quantum  33 https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-09/hackers-expose-tesla-jails-in-breach-of-150-000-security-cams,  last accessed November 2021  https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-09/hackers-expose-tesla-jails-in-breach-of-150-000-security-cams  RESEARCH AND INNOVATION BRIEF  Final | 1.0 | TLP-G | May 2022  19  cryptography as it has reached production phase. However, it is still hard to scale and  the security of the scheme, though unconditionally secure in theory, is subject to  several assumptions in practice.  • New mathematical problems: since the introduction of the public key paradigm in the  middle 1970s, several mathematical problems have been proposed to be used in  public key schemes. However, the public key technologies have been dominated by  two main hard mathematical problems, the factorisation of integers and variants (field,  elliptic curve) of the discrete logarithm problem. The expected implementation of  quantum computing has forced the cryptographic community to invest its research  efforts in new problems or to revisit old ones that did not gain sufficient attention over  the last four decades.  4.2 PRIVACY PRESERVING BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGIES  Blockchain technology offers the possibility of implementing a public digital ledger of  transactions. The main security feature of this structure is that it allows append-only operations  with cryptographic guarantee, i.e. the security of a cryptographic hash function protects the  integrity of the structure. The technology has been widely adopted in many applications and  offers users the ability to deal directly with each other without an intermediary.  Cryptocurrencies and finance in general are the sectors that have recognised the importance of  such a technology and the areas in which the technology has proven its power. However,  several improvements are in order and user's privacy has been identified as one of the most  important among them. While the main goal of blockchain-based cryptocurrencies is  transparency, in many situations individuals or companies want to protect the privacy of the  information surrounding a transaction. After all, finances and transactions are generally held to  be private information. Some of the challenges identified include the following.  • Verifiable computation: the scope of verifiable computation (VC) is to verify the  output of an outsourced operation. The client wants to outsource the computation of  some function to an untrusted machine and be assured that the computed outputs are  correct. The client aims for efficiency and integrity. One of the main application areas is  cloud computing, as cloud data processing results may be incorrect and cannot always  be trusted.  • Standardisation of ZKP schemes: every year several new schemes appear  improving previous works or introducing new properties. The ZKP schemes come into  various flavours and each one is tailored to a specific use case. For the moment, it  does not seem that there is one scheme to rule them all. It is clear from the plethora  and variety of schemes that a clarification of the field is required. Guidelines are  needed to facilitate the selection of the optimal ZKP scheme for each use case34.  4.3 ENHANCED PRIVACY - USER CONTROLLED ENCRYPTION  There is an ongoing debate regarding encryption and its effect on the ability of law enforcement  to access data. While there is no silver bullet that can solve the problem, the discussion  regarding encryption policy or, even better, user-controlled encryption remains alive. EU  Member States are asked to find a balance between ‘security through encryption and despite  encryption’. Legally, EU-wide legislation on strong encryption is identified as a possible  measure to ensure the security of human rights. Some of the challenges identified are shown  below.  • Privacy preserving market: EU Member States must find a balance between privacy  and the prevention of criminal activity. They are invited to protect both privacy and the  34 In 2018, actors from the industry and academia jointly formed the ZKProof standardisation effort. The main goal is to  ‘standardise the use of cryptographic zero-knowledge proofs’. To this day, it is still an on-going effort.  RESEARCH AND INNOVATION BRIEF  Final | 1.0 | TLP-G | May 2022  20  legal rights of EU citizens and EU market clients. The challenge is both technical and  regulative in nature. From the technical point of view, several issues must be resolved,  i.e. key management and data access control.  4.4 HARDWARE-ASSISTED SECURITY  Even the most secure algorithm is vulnerable if the computing environment where it is executed  is not adequately protected. Effective protection mechanisms must be provided throughout the  data cycle, i.e. data must be handled securely at all times and in all locations. This results in  stringent requirements for confidentiality and integrity, not only when data is ‘in transfer’ (e.g.  when it is exchanged over a network connection) or ‘at rest’ (e.g. when it is stored on a disk) but  also when it is ‘in use’ (e.g. it is loaded in RAM or in the CPU for executing a computation).  While protection of data in transfer and at rest is relatively easy to achieve, protection of  data in use is still - to a large extent - an open issue.  Hardware-assisted security does not mean hardware security. The term hardware security  refers to the protection of physical systems from harm, not to the protection of software which  runs on the hardware of a computer system. In hardware-assisted security instead, features of  the hardware are used to support software security, typically by means of Trusted Computing  (TC) features. A key concept of TC is the chain of trust. A chain of trust is established by  validating each component of hardware and software from the end entity up to the root of trust.  Some generally agreed upon features of TC include trusted boot, sealed storage, curtained  memory, attestation, integrity measurement and secure I/O.  Trusted Execution Environment technologies (TEE) provide an application-layer designed for  security aware developers, who partition their application into security critical parts (which are  executed in processor-hardened enclaves and/or protected memory areas) and non-critical  parts (which are executed normally).  TEE has received great attention from developers,  software vendors and original equipment manufacturers (OEM) and software ecosystem  partners. What makes TEE attractive is its capability to provide protection for the integrity and  confidentiality of data-in-use, even against super-privileged software and users. Notably, not  only is this effective against malware but it also removes the need for trusting third parties, such  as the system administrator or the cloud provider.  4.5 PRIVACY PRESERVING AI  AI inference systems are expected to become an integral part of the vast majority of modern  systems deployed and operating in the cloud, on the core network and on devices. Both the  training and prediction phases of AI models pose new risks to client privacy. Many AI models  are optimised by embedding their clients' preferences into the training data, while even the raw  training data may contain private information (gender, location, religion, political views). In the  inference phase, the client's inputs are used unprotected, while in several cases even the AI  model and its coefficients (e.g. weights and biases, architecture) require IP protection. It is no  surprise that the protection of privacy has been identified by the industry as one of the key  factors for the wide adoption of ML inference technology35. The list below identifies the main  areas in the research of privacy in AI.  1. Practical fully homomorphic encryption: homomorphic encryption (HE) is a form of  encryption that permits users to perform computations on encrypted data without first  decrypting it. The problem has been studied for the last four decades and an FHE solution  was first proposed in 2009. Since then, more and more promising schemes have been  proposed.  2. Multi-party computation: in secure multi-party computation (MPC) cryptography, multiple  participants can correctly execute a computation together without revealing their respective  35 https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.04449, last accessed November 2021.  https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.04449  RESEARCH AND INNOVATION BRIEF  Final | 1.0 | TLP-G | May 2022  21  inputs. The field was introduced in the early 1980s, and since then a lot of theoretical work  has been done.  3. Standardisation: an open consortium of industry, government and academia to  standardise homomorphic encryption exists36. The standardisation effort aims to facilitate  the adaption of the HE technology and to present the security properties of the  standardised scheme(s) in a clear and understandable form. All the schemes that have  been proposed for standardisation so far belong in the second category. Besides the fact  that the field of MPC protocols is more mature than HE, the standardisation effort is very  limited.  4. Hardware implementation: in the last decade, the performance of HE schemes has  impressively improved up to five orders of magnitude thanks to advances in the theory and  to more efficient implementations. Despite the impressive improvements that took place  during the last decade, both MPC protocols and HE schemes impose significant  computational overhead that cannot be ignored. Hardware implementation of the  complicated operations and large operands seems to be the solution for efficient MPC and  HE modules.  5. Compilers: realising HE or MPC based computations is complex for the non-expert, there  has been huge progress in the last decade and several compilers have been introduced  that produce efficient protocols. In order to facilitate the work of developers, HE compilers  have been proposed to offer high-level abstraction.  Possible research focus:  • Quantum resilient or safe and efficient public key schemes;  • Efficient implementations of symmetric key schemes that possess a higher level of security;  • Standards for new quantum resilient/safe algorithms and protocols;  • Planning and preparation for the transition to the Post Quantum era of cryptographic systems;  • Hardware assisted security, more specifically on CPU technology, transparent application support and the  combined use of Trusted Execution Environment technologies and Homomorphic Encryption (HE);  • Compilers that produce efficient and secure multi-party computation (MPC) and HE protected code;  • Standardisation of HE schemes and MPC protocols;  • Hardware acceleration of MPC protocols and HE schemes;  • New assumptions and impossibility results that derive from mathematics, physics or hardware limitations,  as a basis for future cryptography;  • Secure implementations of cryptographic systems that resist side channel attacks.  36 www.homomorphicencryption.org, accessed November 2021.  http://www.homomorphicencryption.org/  RESEARCH AND INNOVATION BRIEF  Final | 1.0 | TLP-G | May 2022  22  5. CYBERSECURITY IN LIFE  SCIENCES  (BIOTECHNOLOGY)  Governments and security experts have identified the life sciences sector as particularly  vulnerable to cybercrime. The importance of reviewing cybersecurity related issues in life  sciences, and in biotechnology in particular, is no different from many other critical  infrastructures (e.g. the chemical industry, nuclear physics, etc.). However, the lack of  awareness and of specific cybersecurity controls to address the risks and the long term  implications that may have implications for life itself lends a sense of urgency to the need to  review this topic from a research perspective.  When it comes to cybersecurity, innovation is quickly becoming a double-edged sword for life  sciences customers. Recently, a cybersecurity researcher uncovered37 the threat posed by two  Advance Persistent Threat (APT) groups that gained access to a leading pharmaceutical  company's environment for up to three years before being discovered. They stole IP and  business data from the victim, information on bio culture products, cost reports and other details  related to the company's overseas operations. There is nothing more important to a  pharmaceutical company than the formula for one of its new drugs.  5.1 THE URGENCY OF CYBERBIOSECURITY  Most broadly, cyberbiosecurity aims to identify and mitigate security risks fostered by the  digitisation of biology and the automation of biotechnology. What exactly is meant by this needs  to be explained further. Cyberbiosecurity was first defined38 as understanding the vulnerabilities  to unwanted surveillance, intrusions, and malicious and harmful activities which can occur  within or at the interfaces of commingled life and medical sciences, cyber-physical dimension,  supply chain and infrastructure systems, and developing and instituting measures to prevent,  protect against, mitigate, investigate and attribute such threats as they pertain to security,  competitiveness and resilience. We have reached new milestones in our understanding of how  biological systems work and have also found ways to manipulate these systems to our  advantage or needs in meaningful ways. Biotech tools such as gene editing can intentionally  introduce heritable genetic traits into wild populations, offering a new way to escape certain  vector-borne diseases.  Several areas in Biotech are of particular concern for cyberbiosecurity. Gene editing tools such  as CRISPR-CAS939 (Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats associated  protein-9 nuclease) for example, are used worldwide for rapid and precise gene editing.  Researchers like to use computers to analyse Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA)40, operate lab  machines and store genetic information. In healthcare, the digitisation of biology and metabolic  engineering is accelerating the development of new vaccines, drugs and painkillers. Agriculture  is becoming smarter and digital, with farmers relying on data-driven decisions gained from  37 https://www.darkreading.com/threat-intelligence/state-sponsored-cyberattacks-target-medical-research, last accessed  November 2021.  38 Randall S Murch, William K So, Wallace G Buchholz, Sanjay Raman, and Jean Peccoud.

But these new possibilities also bring a whole new category of vulnerabilities and risks.  In the last five years, the technological barriers to acquiring and using biological weapons have  been significantly lowered. The security implications of biotechnological advances extend  beyond bioweapons. For example, developments in metabolic pathway engineering also offer  ways to produce illicit drugs such as heroin. Scientists have already figured out how to make  the active ingredients in other narcotics, such as cannabis and precursors to Lysergic acid  diethylamide (LSD). What if a terrorist group or despotic regime tries to spread modified  organisms aimed at attacking troops, scaring civilians, or throwing food production into  disarray?  Recently, researchers outlined in a study41 the risks of using gene sequencing technologies to  corrupt databases by altering sequences or annotations. In this article, computer scientists  designed a DNA sample that, when sequenced, resulted in a file that allowed the hacker to  remotely control the sequencing computer and make changes to DNA sequences. These  changes could delay a research program, resulting in capital and labour losses, or could be  used in a terrorist act to produce toxins or infectious agents in an uncontrolled manner. To  mitigate these risks, the culture of the life sciences community must change from blind trust to a  highly aware and educated community. This also requires intricate relationships between the  computational and experimental dimensions of product development workflows.  The multiplicity of pathogens and toxins with their potential to be used as bioweapons (BW)  agents42 could be due to several factors. These include infectivity (the number of organisms  required to cause disease), virulence (the severity of the disease caused), transmissibility (the  ease of spread from person to person) and incubation time (the time from exposure to a  biological agent to a disease outbreak). All these attributes are manageable by modern  biotechnology, and information about such experimental series is key to any covert attack that  uses them as bioweapons.  Similarly, in cyberspace, there are a variety of malicious codes. These include viruses  (programs that replicate in target machines); worms (self-sustaining programs); and carriers  such as a Trojan horse that perform a legitimate function combined with malicious activity.  Additionally, botnets or networks of computers infected with malicious code can be coordinated  to perform distributed denial-of-service attacks.  For biological weapons, means of delivery range from advanced aerial spraying to  contamination of food or water, while malicious code can be transmitted in cyberspace through  user portals, email, web browsers, chat clients, web-enabled applications, and updates. The  cyberthreat has expanded dramatically in recent years through a series of damaging incidents.  Bioinformatics software is still not hardened against cyberattacks. There is a need to promote  the widespread adoption of standard software best practices for security, such as input  sanitisation, use of memory-safe languages or bounds checking on buffers and regular security  audits. Patching remains a challenge because analytics software often resides in individually  managed repositories and is not regularly updated.  41 Randall S Murch, William K So, Wallace G Buchholz, Sanjay Raman, and Jean Peccoud.

Frontiers in bioengineering and biotechnology, 6:39, 2018.  42 Biological weapons are microorganisms like virus, bacteria, fungi or other toxins that are produced and released  deliberately to cause disease and death in humans, animals or plants, WHO (https://www.who.int/health-topics/biological- weapons#tab=tab_1).  RESEARCH AND INNOVATION BRIEF  Final | 1.0 | TLP-G | May 2022  24  5.2 A MAPPING OF KNOWN CYBERBIOSECURITY CHALLENGES AND  EXISTING GAPS  Exploitable technology and a range of (still under-assessed) attack vectors include (a)  databases (including genomic, list of dangerous genes or organisms), design-build-test libraries  and rules, simulations, test data, sample records, (b) individual personal computers, lab  equipment and processes, mission-critical devices and hardware (e.g. assemblers,  synthesisers, sensors), (c) mission-critical software (e.g. workflow controls, process controls),  (d) local and remote networks, and (e) raw materials, supplies and actual biomatter43.  Notably, many of the devices used throughout the biotech sector are portable, and most are  connected to the internet. Challenges arise not only at the level of application but even during  research as well as at the design, build and test level.  Thanks to the inherent vast variation in nature, biological processes are difficult to grasp.  Computerised or automated results (e.g. molecular diagnostic tests) are next to impossible to  verify with the naked eye. Yet more traditional tests and processes throughout the life-science  fields have been replaced by computer technology. Practical skill and hands-on experience are  no longer the focus. Furthermore, more credence is often given to a computerised output (e.g.  in diagnostics) than to clinical observations. While biological or medical decision making was  traditionally based on consensus and expert opinion, computer simulations or automated  processes could easily be distorted and manufactured without anyone being able to tell the  difference. Examples of known attacks show how easy it is to compromise sensors and  protocols and to, for example, achieve misdiagnosis of skin cancer, referable diabetic  retinopathy and pneumonia by automated processes.  5.3 A LARGELY UNRECOGNISED BIOTECH THREAT LANDSCAPE  The most studied cyberbiosecurity danger probably involves pathogenic databases. Several  studies have shown extensive cybersecurity vulnerabilities which are exacerbated by the  human interface (errors and social engineering attacks). The danger is not only that bad actors  could ‘create’ dangerous microorganisms from unsecured digital information. Just as  concerning is the fact that erroneous or manipulated data can compromise international  research activities and public health responses during outbreaks of disease (e.g. when trying to  understand, model and detect new pathogens).  More generally, cyberbiosecurity vulnerabilities can lead to disruption of CIA44 at all levels  (including biosynthetic pathways and processes, software, hardware, mission-critical devises  etc.) and scales (from biological processes at the molecular level to genetically-modified plants,  microbes or animals). Notably, as biotech is only able to work with small biological snippets  (e.g. ‘marker genes’ or ‘DNA signatures’, which are believed to represent the whole organism),  establishing genuine ‘integrity’ of biological entities or processes (e.g. genuine GMOs45 versus  illicit or manipulated ones) is in many cases technically impossible.  Impairment of the confidentiality of biologic data can, for example, leak pathogenic data. Illicit  access to, for example, synthetic processes or critical biomatter can result in the hazardous  distribution of biological agents with a potential global impact.  Making only manipulated devices or processes available can lead to erroneous medical  treatment or misdetection attacks - whereby the device or service could appear to be  functioning while it actually provides false results. For example, with modern sequencing  technologies, this could lead to false diagnostics. Such attacks could even have a global impact  when no other molecular tests are available, as is often the case with novel pathogens.

Questions pointing to research needs and priorities in the context of cyberbiosecurity:  • What is the level of exploitability of biotechnology R&D?  • Which attack vectors could compromise biotechnology R&D?  • What are the most critical digital assets used in biotechnology?  Possible research focus:  • The evolving risks and the threat landscape in biotechnology R&D;  • Risk management framework in the field of public health microbiology (e.g. modern DNA sequencing);  • Categories of cyberbiosecurity vulnerabilities (i.e. distinguishing the more traditional ones from those that  are outside existing methodologies);  • Identification of the processes and routines throughout the life science fields that require interfaces and  reliance on automation.  RESEARCH AND INNOVATION BRIEF  Final | 1.0 | TLP-G | May 2022  26  6. INTERDISCIPLINARITY IN  THE RESEARCH OF CORE  FIELDS  Many common research challenges as well as gaps emerge across all four themes outlined in  this paper (intelligent systems, cyberbiosecurity, computational security and hyperconnected  world).  Key issues focus on the interdisciplinarity of researchers in core areas, and the incorporation (or  reinforcement) of basic cybersecurity principles such as privacy, confidentiality and  trustworthiness. Trust is also a theme that runs through all the major research themes.  Skills, education and awareness in all areas are mentioned in each of the research themes.  New and emerging technologies provide opportunities not only for innovation (societal and  market) but also for abuse. Education and awareness of the potential misuse of these  technological developments must also focus on providing developers and users with the most  appropriate skills.  Many stakeholders are involved in all four research themes, which are identified as crucial  areas that will have an impact on the resilience of our societies. These research themes should  not be interpreted as silos for independent research. Given the nature of the research  challenges, collaboration between the various stakeholders is required, and this needs to be  addressed at a fundamental level in understanding the interactions between technical, political,  societal and economic approaches in these areas. One way is to ensure that this is done with  multidisciplinary teams representing different stakeholders. All these research themes involve  stakeholders at different stages of theory building, conceptualisation, development and  production and should therefore all be integrated into research and innovation activities.  6.1 CONVERGENCE OF AI WITH OTHER EMERGING TRENDS  As the digital ecosystem continues to expand with the Internet-of-Things (IoT) and other  devices connecting individuals, organisations and value chains via mobile phones, central  systems, data centres and also airborne devices, AI can be seen as both a key driver and the  underlying technology in several areas (without claiming to be exhaustive) such as, among  others, next generation mobile telecommunications, computer security and biotechnology (e.g.  cyber biosecurity and synthetic biology).  The development of 6G is expected to reach technological maturity and standardisation over  the next decade, impacting how people interact with the digital world beyond 2030. 6G will go  beyond mobile internet to support ubiquitous AI services from the core to the network terminals.  In fact, 6G can be expected to be ‘AI-enabled’ in the sense that it will both rely on AI for its core  physical layer function and enable a wide range of new AI-based applications.  AI will play a critical role in the development and optimisation of 6G architectures, protocols and  operations. At the same time, AI will be increasingly necessary for the IoT, either to run some  local and relatively closed systems or to monitor the value of the global ecosystem with many  more or less open systems over the Internet, in a cloud or at the edge. AI is undoubtedly an  excellent set of tools to mitigate IoT risks, whether by investigating vulnerabilities, anticipating  RESEARCH AND INNOVATION BRIEF  Final | 1.0 | TLP-G | May 2022  27  problems (or even predicting them through self-reporting capabilities), controlling cross-network  issues, orchestrating traffic and flows, and more generally, the risks of threats.  Cryptography is the foundation of computer security and one of the most important  research areas in cybersecurity. One of the most important discussions in cryptography  research is how it could be seriously affected by the potential of quantum information  processing.  The increasing convergence of biotechnology and AI is also an emerging area to exploit. The  ability to collect and process enormous amounts of data, which underpins AI, machine learning  and deep learning, combined with advances in biotechnology such as gene editing, DNA  sequencing and synthesis, is leading to a leap forward at the heart of the next industrial  revolution. Precision medicine, enhanced bio surveillance46, synthetic biology are all  technologies that will increasingly benefit from the intersection of these two fields. Some  advances being made in the bio-AI synergy may also raise ethical concerns.  In addition to the above, a space for discussions on the perspectives of societal challenges for  the abovementioned research themes needs to be created. These 'perspectives' will  continuously engage with the present, critically assessing our design, use, and adoption of  technology, rather than just looking through technologically-determined lenses toward the  future.  Possible research focus:  • Build systematic anticipatory capacities e.g. launch multidisciplinary Delphi surveys to address key  challenges as they emerge and as they can be anticipated;  • Adopt a ‘broad eye’ lens for AI as the ecosystems we are evoking are constantly expanding, for  example cybersecurity and AI, in the age of quantum cryptography;  • Design roadmaps involving AI capacities for, for example, cryptographic or cyberbiosecurity challenges  over the next 10-15 years.  46 Biosurveillance is an aspect of biodefense relating to the detection of biological threats, including bioterrorist threats,  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biosurveillance, last accessed November 2021.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biosurveillance  RESEARCH AND INNOVATION BRIEF  Final | 1.0 | TLP-G | May 2022  28  7. CLOSING REMARKS AND  NEXT STEPS  This document highlights some of the key R&I needs and priorities identified by ENISA in  consultation with the expert community. The four suggested themes for this year encompass  some of the key trends identified by ENISA for the next 10 to 20 years. It invites researchers  and industry to develop their knowledge on key challenges by identifying the aspects that will  result from a decade of investment in the digitisation of the economy and society in Europe.  Addressing some of the challenges raises some concerns and requires a strong position and  commitment from policy makers and researchers to include them in the R&D programmes and  roadmaps.  Although Europe is at the forefront as a global contributor to R&I, there are several challenges  that need to be addressed, which are highlighted in this report. The first concerns  interdisciplinarity, where excellent research is conducted in disciplinary silos. The second is  linking basic research in advanced and niche areas with broader implementation initiatives,  which are evident in EU funding instruments and beyond. The third is the organisation and  coordination of research efforts in a global context.  The main objective of this document is to serve as a compass for ENISA to advise different  stakeholders, including the EU Commission, the ECCC47 Governing Board and Member States,  on these important requirements for cybersecurity R&I. This document is only a brief overview  of the first edition of the annual report, which summarises the main challenges and research  opportunities in the field of cybersecurity.  During the upcoming years, ENISA will publish separate reports assessing these topics  individually to provide more contextual and technical information on the challenges and  research needs outlined in this report. In parallel, ENISA will continue to engage with  stakeholders and the research community to discuss these and other topics relevant to  cybersecurity. The topics will be identified beforehand from a foresight exercise to be conducted  with stakeholders and the community. The results of these discussions will be reviewed and  described in the form of an annual brief to be published towards the end of the year.  47 https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/cybersecurity-competence-centre, last accessed November 2021.  https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/cybersecurity-competence-centre  ABOUT ENISA  The European Union Agency for Cybersecurity, ENISA, is the Union’s agency dedicated to  achieving a high common level of cybersecurity across Europe.

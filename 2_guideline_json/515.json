In a recent  ENISA study, twelve out of eighteen Member States (MS) that participated in the survey- consider healthcare as a  critical sector, therefore they should take all appropriate measures to protect their ICT systems and assets2.  The scope and governance model of eHealth services may vary in the Member States (MS); it might be implemented  as centralised or even decentralised and may be extended, offering cross-border services. Additionally, critical assets  identification in the healthcare systems and infrastructures may be based on different criteria, such as business  continuity, data security and integrity, services availability, eHealth security policy and legislation. Moreover usual  practices, cyber security challenges, approaches to mitigate risks, and requirements for the eHealth infrastructures  may converge, diverge or be inadequate.  The aim of this study is to investigate the approaches and measures MS take to protect critical healthcare systems,  having as a main goal improved healthcare and patient safety. In that respect this study analyses:   The policy context in Europe and the legislation of the Member States   The perception of the Member States on critical assets in eHealth infrastructures   The most important security challenges   The most common security requirements   Relevant good practices that have been deployed in the MS for eHealth security  Cyber security incidents affecting eHealth services and infrastructures cause great impact. As a result this study  focuses on the availability, continuity and resilience of these systems and infrastructures. Issues like data integrity,  data protection and data confidentiality are always important when we talk about eHealth, however this study aims  at presenting another side of the same coin. It is important to analyse these systems from the availability and  resilience angle to understand how great the societal impact could be should, for example, a network supporting 3- 4 regional hospitals not be available.  To better understand the basic security challenges, features and applications in eHealth services, we focus on three  basic use cases that are considered critical (based on a survey): Cloud Services supporting eHealth, Electronic Health  Records (EHR)/Patient Health Records (PHR) and national eHealth services (i.e. ePrescription).  The following recommendations are targeted to Member State and Operators of critical eHealth infrastructures:  1. Member States should conduct an asset identification and a risk assessment to classify their critical eHealth  infrastructures and services and develop a national catalogue.  2. Member States should introduce clear cyber security guidelines for the protection of their critical eHealth  infrastructures and services.  3. Member States and healthcare organisations should perform an impact/cost benefit analysis of healthcare  cyber security incidents and to use this as leverage for increasing investment on eHealth systems and  infrastructures security.  4. Member States should develop incident response mechanisms to efficiently bring together the healthcare  organisations with the national cyber security competent centres.  1http://www.healthcareitnews.com/news/4-5-health-orgs-hit-cyber-crooks  2 ENISA survey on Critical Information Infrastructures https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/critical-infrastructure-and- services/Methodologies-for-identification-of-ciis  http://www.healthcareitnews.com/news/4-5-health-orgs-hit-cyber-crooks https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/critical-infrastructure-and-services/Methodologies-for-identification-of-ciis https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/critical-infrastructure-and-services/Methodologies-for-identification-of-ciis  Security and Resilience in eHealth  06  5. Member States and healthcare organisations should setup information sharing mechanisms to start  exchanging knowledge and lessons learned on cyber security issues i.e. how they mitigate incidents, which  are the security measures they take etc.  6. European Commission should encourage the development of baseline security measures for eHealth critical  infrastructures and services. This should be done in coordination with the competent centres and the  healthcare organisations operating the critical infrastructures.  7. Member States are encouraged to implement widely accepted security standards to achieve interoperability  and provide the possibility to move towards a uniform European certification scheme.  8. Member States should invest in raising awareness of the citizens and healthcare organisations in providing  cyber security training to personnel and users.  9. Member States’ policy makers should make sure that eHealth is considered as a CIIP issue and should align  with the national CIIP strategy and with the National Cyber Security Strategy (NCSS).  Security and Resilience in eHealth  07  1. Introduction  New, more effective and efficient healthcare processes are being introduced. However, in the era of “digital  Darwinism” (adapt to digital or lag behind) where technology, society and operation models rapidly evolve, the  healthcare operation participant experience (professional, patient) is often suboptimal. Better healthcare for the  patient at a highly controllable cost should be the main goal. The complexity of eHealth systems is very high, which  renders information quality (completeness, integrity), accessibility and availability a very challenging task. Emerging  healthcare data sharing schemes like EHR (Electronic Health Records) or PHR (Patient Health Records) as well as  cross-border scenarios further complicate the technological challenges and respective protection requirements.  The term eHealth is widely used in academia, the private and public sectors, standardisation bodies, manufacturing  organisations and vendors. eHealth systems extend from regional systems, where patients can access online basic  data on their treatment, to national schemes like ePrescription services or cross border eHealth information sharing.  In this report, eHealth is defined as the use of electronic means to acquire, transfer or store healthcare related  information and provide services used by health professionals and consumers3.  Since 20064, many Member States, recognising the importance of this sector and the need for automation, have  drafted national eHealth strategies which include important aspects for ICT adoption in the health sector; such as  EHR, ePrescription, healthcare smart IDs, legal and security issues for eHealth systems, etc. In these strategies health  information networks are considered a vital asset to protect; however in some cases no specific technical  requirements, nor security measures nor controls have been formally established.  ENISA acknowledges the significance of eHealth not only as a major contributor to the societal and financial welfare  of the EU, but more specifically as a critical information infrastructure and focuses for the first time on the security  challenges and risks of ICT of the health sector in the Member States. Given that healthcare services have been  recognized as a critical societal function5, it is important to analyse the degree to which various eHealth systems and  infrastructures are critical for the secure provision of healthcare services.  1.1 Policy Context  EHealth is a priority for the European Commission (EC): the overarching goals of the EC eHealth activities are:   To improve citizens’ health by making life-saving information available – between countries when necessary  using eHealth tools.   To increase healthcare quality and access by making eHealth part of health policy and coordinating EU  countries’ political, financial and technical strategies.   To make eHealth tools more effective, user-friendly and widely accepted by involving professionals and  patients in strategy, design and implementation.  In order to attain these goals, a set of policies have been put in place. Firstly, the EC has adopted the eHealth Action  Plan 2012-2020, which offers a roadmap for attaining four operational objectives: (a) interoperability of eHealth  services, (b) research, development and innovation, (c) uptake and wider deployment, and (d) international  cooperation.  3http://www.who.int/trade/glossary/story021/en/  4 http://ehealth-strategies.eu/  5EC directive on Critical Infrastructures (directive 2008/114/EC) http://ec.europa.eu/dgs/home- affairs/pdf/policies/crisis_and_terrorism/epcip_swd_2012_190_final.pdf  http://ec.europa.eu/health/ehealth/policy/index_en.htm http://ec.europa.eu/health/eHealth/docs/com_2012_736_en.pdf http://ec.europa.eu/health/eHealth/docs/com_2012_736_en.pdf http://www.who.int/trade/glossary/story021/en/ http://ehealth-strategies.eu/ http://ec.europa.eu/dgs/home-affairs/pdf/policies/crisis_and_terrorism/epcip_swd_2012_190_final.pdf http://ec.europa.eu/dgs/home-affairs/pdf/policies/crisis_and_terrorism/epcip_swd_2012_190_final.pdf  Security and Resilience in eHealth  08  Towards achieving the cooperation among the EU MS and the interoperability between electronic health systems,  the eHealth Network was set up by the Directive 2011/24/EU. The eHealth Network consists of representatives from  the 28 MS and its mission is to lead the cooperation among the MS, give direction to eHealth developments and  adopt guidelines (such as the Guidelines on ePrescriptions Dataset for Electronic Exchange).  Further support to the issue of interoperability is provided by the Digital Single Market Strategy, which was adopted  by the EC and defines eHealth as one of the critical sectors for which priorities for security and interoperability should  be set for the benefit of patients, health professional, health systems and industry.  In the same context, the EC issued on 28th of July 2015 the Decision 2015/1302 on the identification of “Integrating  the Healthcare Enterprise” (IHE) profiles for referencing the public procurement. This decision allows for the 27 IHE  profiles to be identified as ICT technical specifications eligible for referencing in public procurement. The 27 IHE  profiles are detailed specifications that optimise the selection of well-established standards describing the different  layers of interoperability (i.e. protocol communication, technical, syntactical, semantic and application levels) with  the aim to find interoperability solutions for exchanging or sharing health data. Hence, the IHE profiles have the  potential to increase interoperability of eHealth services and applications to the benefit of patients and medical  community.  Mobile health (mHealth) is a rapidly developing sub-segment of eHealth that covers medical and public health  practice supported by mobile devices. It comprises a set of technologies which will bring a more innovative care  access reducing healthcare costs at the same time. More specifically, mHealth includes the use of mobile  communication devices for health and well-being services and information purposes as well as mobile health  applications. The European Commission, having recognised the emergent role of mHealth in the transformation of  healthcare, published in April 2014 a Green Paper on mHealth that considers existing barriers and issues related to  mHealth deployment and analyses mHealth potential to maintain and improve patients' health and well-being and  encourage their empowerment.  At the same time, according to the EC Directive on Critical Infrastructures6, healthcare services have been recognized  as a critical societal sector and therefore, healthcare systems are considered as critical infrastructures that should  be protected by all types of threats, including cyber security attacks. Moreover, in the proposed NIS Directive,  healthcare is considered as one of the critical sectors vital for the society.  1.2 Scope and objectives  This study focuses on eHealth information systems and infrastructures as well as on the relevant assets that are  considered critical both for the society and the relevant stakeholder groups. As a starting point, this study aims to  showcase how the MS perceive cyber security in their health systems, which are the specific approaches they follow  and which are the measures they take to protect these systems. Examples of such systems are Healthcare  information networks and systems, EHR, online ePrescription systems (supporting the drug  prescription/dispensing/reimbursement cycle). Based on the criticality of these systems, the scope of this report  narrows down to the availability, integrity of assets and continuity of the services.  ENISA takes stock of how Member States perceive eHealth security, which are the governance models and the  specific requirements, and what are the measures they take to protect it. The aim of this study is to clarify the  eHealth systems security perception in the MS; to identify the gaps and also to recommend, based on good practices,  the next steps for the governmental authorities, the policy makers and specialists.  6 Council Directive 2008/114/EC of 8 December 2008 on the identification and designation of European Critical Infrastructures and the  assessment of the need to improve their protection: http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:32008L0114  http://ec.europa.eu/health/ehealth/policy/network/index_en.htm http://ec.europa.eu/digital-agenda/economy-society-digital-single-market http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=OJ:JOL_2015_199_R_0011 http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=OJ:JOL_2015_199_R_0011 https://ec.europa.eu/digital-agenda/en/news/green-paper-mobile-health-mhealth http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:32008L0114 http://ec.europa.eu/digital-agenda/en/news/network-and-information-security-nis-directive http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:32008L0114  Security and Resilience in eHealth  09  The objectives of this study are to:   Identify national legislation on cyber security and eHealth, the governing authorities and the service  provider organisation;   Assess the perceived criticality of the relevant infrastructures and assets;   Present the security priorities and challenges.  1.3 Methodology  The collection of information was conducted through two parallel activities: a desk research and a series of  interviews accompanied by on-line survey process, to effectively acquire and validate the feedback.   The desk research was focused on the use of ICT in eHealth, more specifically on cyber security risks,  challenges and measures;   The interviews with experts to collect analytical and granular information (country, regional briefs, strategy  and governance issues, security requirements and measures, CIIP, use case scenarios)   Additionally, the on-line survey targeted key experts of the field and was combined with the interviews, to  get more specific information on good practices.  The stakeholders involved7 (representing 18 EU MS and 2 EFTA countries) were either experts in cyber security  related issues or academics conducting research or operators within the field of cyber security in eHealth with the  following profiles:   Public institutions responsible for eHealth strategy   eHealth Competence centres   eHealth platform Operators (CIOs, security officers, end points staff, system administrators)   Academia   User Associations – Networking organisations   Standardisation Bodies   ICT Industry (suppliers)  To better understand security risks the study assesses specific use case scenarios, seen from the CIIP point of view,  based on the feedback received and the general perception. The study identifies actual instances of these scenarios  which were validated by the respective stakeholders.  1.4 Target Audience  This report targets public sector experts in national authorities i.e. Ministry of Health, Ministry of State Affairs,  competent Authorities (like eHealth national centres or cyber security centres) responsible for implementing the  eHealth national strategy with or without mandate on cyber security and CISOs, as it offers recommendation on  what are the steps to follow to protect their assets.  It is  also useful for eHealth services providers (for the public sector), Operators i.e. hospitals and practitioners that  use eHealth systems, as it provides advice on how they may implement security measures in their systems and what  they need to do to comply with the requirements of a security policy.  7 The specific contributions of each interviewee are intentionally left unmentioned, and the individuals are not directly quoted or linked to any given  statement.  Security and Resilience in eHealth  10  1.5 Structure  Following in chapter 2, an overview of policies and strategies on eHealth with specific reference to the Member  States is presented. The criticality of eHealth infrastructures, examples of  identified assets on specific use cases, as  well as the security challenges related to these use cases, are presented in chapter 3.  Chapter 4 analyses the proposed Use Cases in terms of their criticality and security challenges faced. This Chapter  also evaluates good practices in 3 uses cases that were assessed as the most prominent ones by the stakeholder’s  community. Chapter 5 present conclusions and elaborates some recommendations that could be seen either as  input for future works or as issues that need to be properly addressed by the member states.  For the reader’s assistance, a glossary of used terms is introduced in the Appendix. In Annex A, published as a  separate document, the reader can see the country reports, with information on eHealth systems and infrastructures  security in the 28 MS.  Security and Resilience in eHealth  11  2. eHealth Security in the Member States  2.1 Overview of national legislation  The first step to understand the perception of eHealth in the MS is to identify the landscape and how Critical  Information Infrastructure Protection (CIIP) is linked to eHealth. The approaches followed vary depending on the  priorities of each country. We categorise them based on the existence of an eHealth strategy, on the specific  legislation and on the way cyber security is included in the eHealth national framework.  In most countries an eHealth strategy exists, following the recommendation of the first EU eHealth Action Plan  requesting the Member States to setup such policy documents to describe eHealth specificities, bodies involved and  their responsibilities at a national level. Overall, eHealth infrastructures protection falls under the generic umbrella  of CIIP. Currently, there is no specific regulatory framework on critical eHealth infrastructure protection. This  information is presented in Table 1 (further information can be found in the annexed document named “Country  Reports – Current Status on eHealth in the Member States” with references).

A working group has been set up within the cyber security authority in order to perform a gap analysis for  security measures.  Romania   Strategy: There is no eHealth specific strategy.   Legislation: Romania operates a central EHR system under the Health Reform Law 95/20069, that requires the  Ministry of Public Health to establish an integrated information system for public health management.

Issues pertaining to eHealth are  indirectly addressed in the Avanza Plan and the National Health Plan. Furthermore, several regions in Spain have  developed their own eHealth strategies.  Sweden   Strategy: National eHealth – the strategy for accessible and secure information in health and social care (2010)   Legislation:  o Patient Data Act  o Act on Electronic Prescription  United Kingdom   Strategy: United Kingdom pursues several distinct healthcare strategies, as NHS develops its own solutions in  accordance with its respective legal framework. In fact UK has 4 independent NHS systems for England, Whales,  Scotland and Northern Ireland.  2.2 Common deployment models in EU MS  Some MS are moving from the “healthcare data capture” stage to the “data analysis” and “data sharing” stage. The  main goal is to improve healthcare via informed treatment decisions. As previously described, the “data sharing”  stage involves the deployment of healthcare networks, which can securely retrieve patient data from various sources  and make them available to the patient and the responsible healthcare professional. Relevant schemes like EHR and  PHR, are currently trending in various MS. The eHealth models deployed in various MS vary, as analysed below:  Structural features of the model  National vs regional (or centralised vs decentralised) structures characterise eHealth in Europe. Moreover, hybrid  models and loose connection (also called federation) of regional structures can be found. These features may  influence both organisational and technological structures.  9 http://legeaz.net/PdfDoc/legea-95-2006-actualizata-2012.pdf  http://legeaz.net/PdfDoc/legea-95-2006-actualizata-2012.pdf  Security and Resilience in eHealth  15  In some MS the eHealth model is centralised with the mandated ministry assuming the overall responsibility,  whereas in other MS part and/or the entire responsibility is assigned to regional authorities. It should be noted,  that in a few MS, the regions develop their own eHealth legislation and/or eHealth systems.  Spain’s decentralised/regional [1] eHealth system  Health care in Spain is highly decentralised among the 17 Regions. The Ministry is responsible to coordinate and to assure  equality. The decentralisation of services, and the growing mobility of citizens make it necessary for services providers  (Regions) to collaborate beyond their boundaries, to provide quality services focused on patient safety.  Spain has a regional deployment of e-prescription system [2], interconnected at the national level (47,5 mil. eDispensations  performed in 2014 - 70% of dispensations). Spain also has a regional EHR deployment.  Spain’s model incorporates a powerful central switching point allowing for the addition of services required to the national  healthcare system, to ensure its sustainability and evolution.  Hospital-system driven  This approach, identified in one EFTA European country, puts in the driving seat one of the main eHealth  stakeholders, the hospitals. In this case, the hospital developed its own eHealth infrastructure and eHealth  application, including a PHR application.  Switzerland: Geneva HUG10  The university hospitals of Geneva deployed ‘my medical dossier, an online electronic health record where all the health data  that need to be exchanged between physicians, hospitals, laboratories and insurance companies are stored[3]. Hug was  created in 1995, when all public hospitals in Geneva were merged and now hug covers the whole spectrum of outpatients  and primary, secondary and tertiary inpatients care, including long-term rehabilitation and psychiatry. In 2013 60,000  admissions and over 900,000 outpatient visits took place, while 6,000,000 laboratory testing were done [4]. Mon dossier  medical today includes clinical and non-clinical processes into a patient-centered care service and covers complete order  entry for all orders including lab, drug, radiology, and care; unified clinical documentation; administrative information; access  management; imaging; and laboratory information. Mon dossier medical itself is always the result of a real-time query of all  relevant databases in the system [5].  Cross-border use cases  Cross-border use cases have been deployed within the EU-sponsored Large Scale Project (epSOS LSP). Pilot projects  on specific use cases have been evolving to official & standardized healthcare information exchanges, gaining  increased traction, through ongoing EU sponsored activities. In this case the deployment model is crossing European  Countries, while certain services are deployed centrally (e.g. value coding and transformation services, required to  provide semantic interoperability between MSs).  Cross- border e-Prescription and e-dispensing  between Sweden and Finland[6]  Within the EPSOS project, Finland and Sweden developed a pilot service between pharmacies in Finland and pharmacies in  Sweden. Around 10.000 user of the myKanta system in Finland gave their consent to participate in the pilot, which resulted  in one of the more successful pilots of epSOS. The number of exchanged electronic prescriptions was quite moderate but  many features and needs came up from this pilot, especially in the semantic domain where real case issues came up  concerning drug substitution, active ingredient matching and others. Most of those problems are currently dealt under the  project openMedicine, which will allow effective semantic interoperability amongst member states in the domain of  electronic prescription.  10 Exemplar case that is referenced throughout the report as good practice for eHealth services practices.

As an example, the NHS  in the England has suffered six data breaches every day since 201111 study states; hospital systems and networks  can be affected as every other network by viruses12 resulting into denial-of-service attacks and affecting for days all  operations in the hospital, a common phenomenon13; malicious physical attacks can compromise data integrity and  availability14; healthcare organisations are being targeted by sophisticated and highly organized cybercriminals who  are showing every day how vulnerable the eHealth systems are15. And the situation keeps getting more difficult.  Nations should realise how vital their national eHealth systems are and take all necessary measures to protect them.  Healthcare systems are becoming vulnerable to cyber security incidents due to various reasons; the volume of  information and the connection with patients dictates the use of automation and IT; the diverse nature of healthcare  information systems enables different devices to access the Internet (even though not designed for this) thus making  them easy targets; many outdated applications and systems didn’t include security as a priority requiring close  attention of the information security officers and finally the exponentially increasing attack surface is making  systems compromise an easier task. Combining these reasons with the fact that a breach of security can impact large  parts of the population16 makes eHealth a critical sector.  The analysis of the collected information is presented in this section: the most important reasons behind classifying  eHealth systems as critical are described, as well as some of the most prominent security challenges.  3.1 eHealth as a Critical Information Infrastructure  Not all MS consider eHealth as a critical sector; in some cases eHealth services formulate a different category of  emergency services and are not classified as critical, in other cases healthcare ICT services are not considered critical  as the environment is considered so isolated that any incident would have small impact. Criticality of eHealth  infrastructure is identified through three different perspectives:  a) The first perspective, healthcare business continuity, examines which assets (infrastructures and services)  are required to ensure baseline functionality of the entire eHealth system and vitality to society. Under  this perspective, central components and / or services that comprise the backbone of the eHealth system  are considered as critical. These components may include health provider or patients’ index service,  document registries, medical databases, eHealth specific identifier services etc.  b) The second perspective is data security and integrity. It examines data storage components, network  elements (e.g. an access router to a site hosting the eHealth application) for exchanging health data and  Identity and Access Management Systems (IAM). An analysis on specific assets for a given use case can be  found in section 3.2.  c) The third perspective focuses on availability. For example, if the unavailability of a service is creating high  impact to the society, such as loss of life, then this service is critical. In this perspective, applications like  EHR are considered to be critical, whereas network availability is crucial. Additionally, systems and services  11 http://www.computerworlduk.com/news/security/3586072/nhs-suffered-six-data-breaches-every-day-since-2011-study-finds/?intcmp=in_article  12 Dynes, Information Security and Health Care: A Field Study of a Hospital after a Worm Event, Technical Report, Centre for Digital Strategies, Tuck School of  Business, Dartmouth College, Hanover, New Hampshire, 2006.  13 http://www.volkskrant.nl/wetenschap/ziekenhuisapparatuur-slecht-beveiligd-tegen-computervirussen~a3946259/  14 https://www.secnews.gr/90665/isma%CE%AD%CE%BA%CE%B8%CE%B5%CF%83%CE%B7- %CE%B1%CF%84%CE%BF%CE%BC%CE%B9%CE%BA%CF%8E%CE%BD- %CF%80%CE%BB%CE%B7%CF%81%CE%BF%CF%86%CE%BF%CF%81%CE%B9%CF%8E%CE%BD-%CE%B1%CF%80%CF%8C-%CE%BA%CE%BB%CE%BF/  15 http://www.computerworld.com/article/2914741/cybercrime-hacking/researchers-hijack-teleoperated-surgical-robot-remote-surgery-hacking- threats.html  16www.computerworld.com/article/2975988/healthcare-it/more-than-80-of-healthcare-it-leaders-say-their-systems-have-been-compromised.html  http://www.computerworlduk.com/news/security/3586072/nhs-suffered-six-data-breaches-every-day-since-2011-study-finds/?intcmp=in_article http://www.volkskrant.nl/wetenschap/ziekenhuisapparatuur-slecht-beveiligd-tegen-computervirussen~a3946259/ https://www.secnews.gr/90665/isma%CE%AD%CE%BA%CE%B8%CE%B5%CF%83%CE%B7-%CE%B1%CF%84%CE%BF%CE%BC%CE%B9%CE%BA%CF%8E%CE%BD-%CF%80%CE%BB%CE%B7%CF%81%CE%BF%CF%86%CE%BF%CF%81%CE%B9%CF%8E%CE%BD-%CE%B1%CF%80%CF%8C-%CE%BA%CE%BB%CE%BF/ https://www.secnews.gr/90665/isma%CE%AD%CE%BA%CE%B8%CE%B5%CF%83%CE%B7-%CE%B1%CF%84%CE%BF%CE%BC%CE%B9%CE%BA%CF%8E%CE%BD-%CF%80%CE%BB%CE%B7%CF%81%CE%BF%CF%86%CE%BF%CF%81%CE%B9%CF%8E%CE%BD-%CE%B1%CF%80%CF%8C-%CE%BA%CE%BB%CE%BF/ https://www.secnews.gr/90665/isma%CE%AD%CE%BA%CE%B8%CE%B5%CF%83%CE%B7-%CE%B1%CF%84%CE%BF%CE%BC%CE%B9%CE%BA%CF%8E%CE%BD-%CF%80%CE%BB%CE%B7%CF%81%CE%BF%CF%86%CE%BF%CF%81%CE%B9%CF%8E%CE%BD-%CE%B1%CF%80%CF%8C-%CE%BA%CE%BB%CE%BF/ http://www.computerworld.com/article/2914741/cybercrime-hacking/researchers-hijack-teleoperated-surgical-robot-remote-surgery-hacking-threats.html http://www.computerworld.com/article/2914741/cybercrime-hacking/researchers-hijack-teleoperated-surgical-robot-remote-surgery-hacking-threats.html http://www.computerworld.com/article/2975988/healthcare-it/more-than-80-of-healthcare-it-leaders-say-their-systems-have-been-compromised.html  Security and Resilience in eHealth  17  that are directly linked to the patient’s care as diagnostic systems and Intensive Care Unit (ICU) and the  systems that aggregate information related to patient’s care are considered as critical as well.  In this study, to depict the critical assets in eHealth systems, we follow the approach as described in the diagram  below. First the critical eHealth service is identified. Then it is broken down to core applications, which are in turn  broken down into CII assets. This is a common approach the MS could adopt to decide their focus when classifying  eHealth infrastructures.  Figure 1 Steps to identify CIIs  However most MS have not developed a specific methodology, legislation or regulation for the identification of  critical eHealth infrastructures17. Rather, the identification and protection of critical eHealth infrastructures is based  on the general regulation and strategy for CIIP – wherever this is applicable.  As underlined during the stock taking, not all Member States have defined critical eHealth Infrastructures and  identified relevant assets. Therefore, the process to protect the latter is based mainly on efforts of each healthcare  Unit or system Operator.  3.1.1 National approaches  It should be noted that eHealth is not acknowledged as a critical sector in all Member States. In many cases, eHealth  is identified as part of a critical sector such as Healthcare services and/or ICT.  Countries that identify eHealth as a critical sector address the protection of critical eHealth infrastructures according  to the general legislation and guidelines that describe how national critical infrastructures should be protected and  how critical data should be stored, protected and handled. In many cases infrastructure criticality is handled  according to civil protection law, together with telecom infrastructure, transport communications, etc.  Austria’s eHealth regulation  Austria’s eHealth regulation is closely bound to e-government regulation (data protection act, CIIP law) as well as to civil protection law.  Common practice is that central state administration bodies (e.g. ministries that are responsible for the critical sectors) identify the  17https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/critical-infrastructure-and-services/Methodologies-for-identification-of-ciis  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/critical-infrastructure-and-services/Methodologies-for-identification-of-ciis  Security and Resilience in eHealth  18  critical infrastructures based on a defined process, maintain a database of critical infrastructures and prepare a risk analysis of the critical  infrastructure.  In most cases, the CIIP mandate lies within the organisation that is responsible for CIIP in general, while in very few  cases, an eHealth organisation has a CIIP mandate. If there is no such mandate, then the responsibility is assumed  by the organisation that is overall responsible for the public healthcare sector, e.g. the Ministry of Health. If there is  a national security agency, and no other competent authority has a mandate on cyber security, then a common  practice is that they provide cyber security expertise horizontally in all sectors.  Examples of CIIP approaches  In Greece CIIP is handled horizontally via the civil protection legislation under action programs such as Perseas and Xenocratis. In other  words this means that eHealth infrastructure is considered of critical impact if it becomes unavailable in case of emergency. However  since Greece hasn’t performed a national assets risk assessment, health care systems cannot be considered as critical information  infrastructures.  In another example, Estonia has a nationwide approach concerning IT system security and defer the responsibility of eHealth CIIP to  the Estonian eHealth Foundation. Although, eHealth is not considered as a CII in Estonia.  In Finland, the CIIs as well as all eHealth infrastructures are regulated by law: Act on the Electronic Processing of Client Data in Social  and Health Care 159/2007.  In Germany the new IT Security Law includes security measures for all critical information infrastructures, ehealth services are  considered critical. As BSI is the national security agency of Germany, they are the competent authorities to orchestrate the  implementation of the provisions required by the law, and to monitor them, provide guidelines etc.  A third approach would be the one based on voluntary initiatives/ measures by healthcare units not aligned to any  central or regional initiative (e.g. Geneva region EHR initiative leading the national EHR plan, 4th Greek RHA  Healthcare Units initiatives).  From this information we conclude that there is no specific scheme when talking about critical information  infrastructures protection governance, each country follows a model that is tailored to its needs. However it is very  important to underline that identification of the assets and the infrastructures should be done through cooperation  of the national authorities with the operators of the systems.  3.2 eHealth critical systems and assets  Having discussed the approaches followed in order to assess criticality, we present specific ICT assets which can be  identified as critical for the proper operation of an eHealth system. Given that the scope of eHealth systems is very  wide and the operational models and ICT implementations of a specific use case may vary, the attempt to analyse  and identify assets is based on examples, to identify through them significant assets which can impact the proper  operation of an eHealth system in case of failure.  Security and Resilience in eHealth  19  Figure 2 Criteria to assess criticality of assets  Operational models served by eHealth systems may vary in their functional aspects (e.g. a system may serve only e- prescription use cases, while another may serve both e-prescription & patient summary) and/or in legal aspects  since they have to follow the legal framework and organisational model of each MS. Modern heavy duty information  systems are characterized by a very high technical complexity and therefore technical implementation approaches  vary. Moreover, alternative design models may be followed when implementing systems (e.g. EHR systems have  been designed and implemented based on alternative ICT architectures with variant centralization degrees).  Based on the information received by the interviewees, assets considered as critical are:   Health Information systems, i.e. the information networks in the hospitals;   Clinical data repositories i.e. the databases in each hospital where information is stored locally;   Authentication server i.e. to perform access control and authentication of users;   Laboratory Information System (LIS)   Radiology Information Systems (RIS);   Picture Archiving and Communication Systems (PACS), i.e. transferring radiology results;   Electronic Health Record components;   Patient Health Record service;   ePrescription service;  We present below two examples of systems that were reported critical by all our interviewees, the EHR system and  the e-Prescription.  Example A: electronic health record (EHR) system  While there is sufficient support in academic literature and analysis, there is limited standardized architectural  design of an EHR. It is stated that there are centralised and distributed architectural options. Architectural options  are depicted in Figure 3.

From the outset, a clear distinction between the EHR as a singular entity and systems that  operate on the EHR – i.e., EHR systems is critical18.  Even though many definitions exist for EHR, the official ones, according to ISO TR 20514 health informatics -  electronic health record, are presented below.  EHR: A repository of information regarding the health status of a subject of care, in  computer processable form. An EHR provides the ability to share patient health information  between authorized users of the EHR and the primary role of the EHR is supporting  continuing, efficient and quality integrated health care.  EHR system: The set of components that form the mechanism by which electronic health  records are created, used, stored, and retrieved. It includes people, data, rules and  procedures, processing and storage devices, and communication and support facilities.  Several EHR architectures have been deployed throughout the world19. The most commonly recognized are: the  centralised /fully integrated model, the decentralised/federated model and hybrids of the two models. As depicted  in Figure 3, different architectural approaches are followed by those countries which have deployed EHRs. In the  centralised model all the responsibilities, including cyber security, are in the mandate of one body, this might be the  Ministry of health (MoH) or the national eHealth centre. They are also responsible for EHR, and all healthcare  organisations (hospitals, GPs etc.) are directly reporting to them.  On the other hand in the de-centralised scheme  EHR is powered by the operator but instances exist in the several healthcare organisations.  In the EU, the NHS (UK) has deployed a centralised EHR architecture (called integrated EPR20). Germany, Denmark,  Spain are deploying a decentralised EHR model based on a service oriented architecture, while the Netherlands are  deploying a federated EHR model21.  18http://www.hl7.org/implement/standards/product_brief.cfm?product_id=18  19 http://www.corepointhealth.com/geni/health-information-exchange-architecture-types  20 http://mthink.com/article/federated-and-centralized-it-architecture-models-for-portable-ehrs/  21Bernd Blobel, Head, eHealth Competence Center, University Hospital Regensburg, Germany, Jahrestagung der HL7 Benutzergruppe Schweiz,  Oktober 2012  Figure 3 EHR architectural models (see glossary)  http://www.iso.org/iso/iso_catalogue/catalogue_tc/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=39525 http://www.hl7.org/implement/standards/product_brief.cfm?product_id=18 http://www.corepointhealth.com/geni/health-information-exchange-architecture-types http://mthink.com/article/federated-and-centralized-it-architecture-models-for-portable-ehrs/  Security and Resilience in eHealth  21  An EHR focusing on continuity of the care record (containing various patient healthcare episodes of care and  respective results throughout time) will need to extract data from many sources (e.g. healthcare unit databases, e- prescription systems, healthcare practitioner medical notes) as depicted conceptually in a very simplified mode in  Figure 4 the ‘assets analysis’ below is based on the main ICT component categories.  Figure 4 EHR data flow  When data are not persistently stored at the main EHR application, which is a common design option, then there is  no single database asset involved. Therefore the resilience of the overall system is high, given that it depends neither  on a single data source (several data sources are involved), nor on a single central database asset. Listed below are  the critical assets that constitute the EHR system together with what will happen in case of failure and the impact  an incident would cause.  ASSET IMPACT IN CASE OF FAILURE  Components of network connecting the healthcare operators  with the EHR system  Loss of availability (no access to the information)  Identity management system, for access control and  authorization  Loss of availability (no access to classified information)  Web, Application and database servers  Loss of availability (no access application services)  Business process and Application logic assuring data integrity Data integrity violation  Interoperability Enterprise Service Bus – document exchange  interface  Loss of availability (no information exchange between point of care  sites)  Databases and storage components Loss of availability (no storage and retrieval of information)  Monitoring and logging of information exchanges  Confidentiality violation (unmonitored access to sensitive  information)  User management and Patient consent application  Confidentiality & data integrity violation  (misuse and illegal access to  information)  Master Patient Indexes, Healthcare Providers registries Data integrity violation  Table 2 EHR assets analysis  Example B: e-prescription / e-dispensing system  Security and Resilience in eHealth  22  E-Prescription systems have been mentioned during the survey by MS stakeholders as a significant eHealth initiative.  An e-prescription / e-dispensing system serves the patient’s need on the prescription and dispensing of medicine  and automate/optimize the process, which is depicted in a rather simplified mode in Figure 5. The first step of the  process is the patient visiting a physician, who examines the patient and prescribes medicine on the system (if  needed). The second step is the patient visiting a pharmacy, which dispenses the medicine to the patient.  Figure 5 E-prescription / e-dispensing core cycle  An e-prescription / e-dispensing system may commonly be a web-based application. Usually, e-prescription systems  are based on very thorough and analytical interoperability frameworks based on international standards that allow  secure and quality proofed information exchange between the systems at the different points of care. Such real  world examples are deployed in countries such as Denmark, Sweden, Greece, Croatia, Finland etc.  Even though actual ICT implementations are expected to differ, best of breed ICT approaches are commonly  followed, namely: redundant components at all levels to enhance resilience (three-tier  architectures/web/application/database tier), deployment of primary and secondary data centre sites, enhanced  perimeter and internal security measures (e.g. several types of firewalling techniques, audit logging at many levels,  SIEM tools).  Such a system may be serving tens of thousands of medical doctors and pharmacies, especially when deployed at a  national level. Therefore it has to be highly resilient and scalable. Service outages though not life threatening, may  cause serious distress to the society. Assets critical to its operation are depicted below.

EHealth faces many security challenges; the great  majority of which are common to any critical infrastructure. In the interviews conducted for the purposes of the  current report, the respondents were asked on which are the most important cyber security challenges in eHealth  infrastructures and systems. The results are depicted below:  Security and Resilience in eHealth  24  Figure 6 Security challenges  Systems availability  Systems availability is the basic feature for achieving continuity of electronic healthcare. It is about continuous  accessibility of critical health information by authorized professionals in order to ensure the best healthcare services.  Systems availability may relate to physical systems function (e.g. networks, storage) and affect significantly the  healthcare delivery. In HUG (Hôpitaux Universitaires de Genève), if the network is down, the healthcare providers  cannot access patient’s data and cannot prescribe. Generally, the more digitized the health sector in a country, the  more the health services are affected by interruptions in eHealth infrastructures. The HUG is highly digitized  (documentation, imaging, laboratory systems, patient administration systems). Therefore, network and information  system availability are considered to be very critical. Systems availability may also relate to the maturity of business  continuity infrastructure and process in place, namely, systems integration. A violation of the processes protocol  may lead to the interruption of services. A typical example is to experience an interruption because an operator  might proceed to an update without following the protocol. In this case, the impact on the continuity of services can  be really high. For example, in Estonia, if central services are interrupted, 1600 healthcare providers are affected.  Another parameter which may affect business continuity is the type of the model that is used in eHealth services. In  case this model is not patient-centric, a patient may easily have hundreds of separate, overlapping records in various  systems and this limits the availability of information22, a condition which affects patient safety and leads to  unnecessary duplication of tests and investigations, so it increases the cost of the services23. Under the umbrella of  systems availability falls also the application security for  Lack of interoperability  EHealth infrastructures include many diverse systems and applications interconnected at various scales i.e. a medical  device collecting clinical data can be linked in the same network that a computer uses to access Internet. A core  issue for an effective and secure use of these services is to ensure a high level of interoperability and guarantee that  22 Access Control and Integration of Health Care Systems: An Experience Report and Future Challenges, Lillian Røstad, Øystein Nytrø, The Second International  Conference on Availability, Reliability and Security, 2007  23 Developing National eHealth Interoperability Standards for Ireland: A Consultation Document, Health Information and Quality Authority, Ireland, 2011  0  2  4  6  8  10  12  Which do you believe are the most important security challenges  in eHealth infrastructures and systems?  Security and Resilience in eHealth  25  information is transmitted safely through individual information systems, health service institutions, healthcare  providers and patients24  and, on the other hand, that the recipient’s system is able to use the information received  in order to proceed in various actions25. For example, the vocabulary used in EHR, namely the terminologies, the  classifications, the metadata26, or the cloud services among different cloud service providers, local or external clouds,  must be based on universally applied standards and an agreed-upon framework or some open protocols/APIs for  secure information exchange and services integration27.The lack of interoperability may also affect the security  updates in an eHealth services network. For instance, some healthcare providers in Estonia still used Windows XP  until the previous autumn, while all the software companies were about to stop producing updates for this operating  system, so this was a significant obstacle to take all the necessary security measures for the stakeholders. In the  current report, 25% of the survey respondents claimed that there is no interoperability framework in place at their  organisation.  Access control and authentication  A recent study by KPMG28 showed that among the greatest vulnerabilities in data security is sharing data between  third parties and insiders (breaches by employees). This finding indicates access control and authentication as key  security features in eHealth infrastructures. Authentication is the initial stage of the users’ validation in order to  determine their identity which is necessary to ensure that they are authorized to access the system. Once  authenticated, the information level that they are allowed to view or share for organisational purposes is defined by  an access control policy29. Access control is one of the main safeguards for ensuring data privacy and integrity30. A  centralised system (e.g. an HIS) with limited external connection has a specific perimeter which needs to be  safeguarded. In such a case, internal user access control becomes a higher challenge than external access control.  On the other hand, a distributed EHR or a mHealth chronic disease management system needs to prevent  unauthorized access on data over the network. Apart from enforcing authentication and access control, the need to  retain at the same time a user-friendly system is of great importance since it helps avoiding errors introduced by the  user. Additionally, with respect to the prevention of inappropriate or illegal disclosure it is crucial for providers of  health data to be sure that parties who consume data enforce, in turn, access constraints conformant to the  purposes under which that data was provided. Therefore the definition and enforcement of access rules for health  data and services throughout clinical workflows is a precondition for any cooperative patient treatment31.  Data integrity  One of the most common cyber security challenges in eHealth is ensuring quality and integrity of the data that are  stored and exchanged for clinical and administrative purposes. Examples include clinical laboratory test results,  patient demographics, medication related information, radiology reports and images, pathology reports, hospital  admission, discharge and transfer dates, etc. Data integrity is crucial, as errors in personal or clinical data may affect  a person’s medical treatment, insurance or employability32. These errors are often related to incorrect entry by staff,  24 e-Health Cloud: Opportunities and Challenges, Eman AbuKhousa, Nader Mohamed and Jameela Al-Jaroodi, Future internet, 2012  25 E-QUALITY IN E-HEALTH, Stakeholders' reflections on adressing e-health, Health First Europe, 2010  26 Data Integrity in an Era of EHRs, HIEs, and HIPAA: A Health Information Management Perspective, AHIMA, Dan Rode, MBA, CHPS, FHFMA Vice President,  Advocacy and Policy,2012  27 Developing National eHealth Interoperability Standards for Ireland: A Consultation Document, Health Information and Quality Authority, Ireland, 2011  28 Health care and cyber security: Increasing Threats Require Increased Capabilities, KPMG, 2015  29Privacy Oriented Access Control for Electronic Health Records, Randike Gajanayake, Renato Iannella, Tony Sahama, In Data Usage Management on the Web  Workshop at the Worldwide Web Conference, ACM, Lyon Convention Centre, Lyon, France, 2012  30 Access Control in Healthcare Information Systems, Thesis for the degree of Philosophiae Doctor (PhD), Norwegian University of Science and Technology,  Trondheim, January 2009  31 http://www.ihe.net/Technical_Framework/upload/IHE_ITI_TF_WhitePaper_AccessControl_2009-09-28.pdf  32Ensuring Data Integrity in Health Information Exchange, AHIMA Thought Leadership Series, American Health Information Management Association, 2012 p.2  http://www.ihe.net/Technical_Framework/upload/IHE_ITI_TF_WhitePaper_AccessControl_2009-09-28.pdf  Security and Resilience in eHealth  26  incorrect conversion from a paper-based filing system to electronic health records33 34 and improper or insufficient  use of standard based healthcare information exchange protocols35 36 37.  Network Security  A fundamental challenge in securing eHealth infrastructures is considered to be network security, and according to  the interviewees, this is highly related to many security incidents. Network security becomes critical when the  security of other critical assets relies on the security of the network. This is a top priority when the eHealth system  is network based (e.g. EHR/PHR, cross border eHealth). Recent reports indicate that one of the main vulnerabilities  of an eHealth network are the inadequate firewalls by 27% and place the external attackers as one of the major  threats by 65%38, while the 81% of health care executives surveyed claim that their organisations experienced  attacks by at least one malware, botnet or other cyber-attack during the past two years and only half feel that they  are adequately prepared to prevent attacks39.  Security expertise and awareness  A critical parameter for achieving and maintaining a high security level in eHealth systems and networks appears to  be the security expertise. The security practices by personnel are considered a source of potential problems and  appear to be a significant challenge, as in some countries, like Austria, the human factor is considered the most  important cause of security incidents. Thus, ensuring that the security architecture and all the respective procedures  and measures that must be followed are well designed, understood and applied by all relevant stakeholders in an  organisation is of high importance. A critical factor which contributes to awareness raising is the appropriate,  adequate and sufficient organisational structure and especially the role of a security officer. Nowadays 20% of  healthcare providers don’t have a leader solely responsible for information technology security40 and -in some  countries, like Estonia- a security officer placement is an organisational structure mandatory by law only for public  sector. Therefore many concerns are raised for the private sector security practices, since the lack of this asset may  lead to misuse of security standards and a gap between security policy and work practices41 42. Finally, another major  concern regarding the lack of security expertise is that the 23% of organisations do not have a security operations  centre to identify and evaluate threats43.  Data loss  The digitalization of information and the high level of eHealth services penetration in the healthcare sector mean  that a significant amount of vital, personal and confidential data are stored in digital format. In this framework, the  protection of the data from loss is considered to be very important. On the other hand, sometimes it is impossible  to avoid ending up in such a critical situation (e.g. software and hardware faults, network faults, security attacks,  and natural disasters), so data recovery and the timeframe that it can be achieved is closely related to data loss.  Common causes of data loss are unauthorised access to clinical patient data by IT vendors and by healthcare  organisations personnel and the back-up policy44.

Standardisation, Compliance and trust  One of the main concerns in attaining security in eHealth infrastructures is the proper use and persistence to create,  maintain and enforce an interoperability framework so that integrated systems contributes to cost reduction in  eHealth46. Some experts expressed concerns around the applied security policy from the third-party providers. The  European Commission has foreseen this need and thoroughly studied it during the HITCH and ANTILOPE projects. In  some countries, like Estonia, providers from the private sector are not obliged to comply with a specific and detailed  security standard. Additionally, eHealth professionals in Estonia find the requirements defined in the data protection  act to be abstract, something that results in problems in practice.  Cross-border incidents  Cross-border eHealth services play a significant role, especially in the European framework of free mobility for  citizens across the EU, since it is one of the main instruments to reach globally the public health objectives ensuring  the safety of emergency care and the continuity of non-emergency care. The challenges that shall be tackled in order  to facilitate transferability of data in cross-border healthcare are mainly related to building a common  interoperability and access control and authentication framework47. For example, the Estonian ID-card is issued only  to citizens and residents of Estonia. The Mobile-ID requires activation with an Estonian ID-card; consequently  Mobile-ID is also available for Estonian residents only and there is no support for qualified certificates issued by  other countries48. The European Commission has invested substantial human and financial resources to prevent  cross border incidents from happening. The extensive use of integration profiles such as IHE ATNA, provide effective  logging of information exchange that minimise the case of cross border incidents.  Incidents management  Incidents management is a major challenge in eHealth  security. Although 75% of the respondent’s implement  security policies in their eHealth systems and/or  infrastructures, there are incidents that can be neither  anticipated nor avoided. Security incidents root causes  include, human errors, natural phenomena, malicious  actions (DDoS attack, MITM attacks, etc.) and system  failures (including third party failure, i.e. hardware  failure). System failures and human errors account  equally for the majority of the incidents reported.  Deliberate human intervention to disrupt the workflow  (i.e. malicious actions) also accounts significantly for  jeopardizing security, whereas the impact of natural  phenomena accounts for a small only portion of the  reported security incidents. It has to be noted that  human factor may also relate to malicious actions,  from the perspective of causing system holes by  negligence or oversights, which could lead to system inefficiencies and thus make the infrastructures vulnerable to  possible attacks. Human error also includes incorrect security practices by personnel which may result in security  45European Hospital Survey: Benchmarking Deployment of eHealth Services  46Developing National eHealth Interoperability Standards for Ireland: A Consultation Document, Health Information and Quality Authority, Ireland, 2011  47E-QUALITY IN E-HEALTH.

Therefore, eHealth organisations need to have an incident response capacity, in order  to timely identify incidents and restore and reconstitute systems and services in a trusted manner. Apparently, there  is a need to develop an eHealth specific incident reporting, classification and alerting mechanism in pan European  level. International good practices could be consulted towards this direction.  3.4 Information security requirements for eHealth  Security requirements, which the operators have to meet, are drawn from the legal framework of each EU MS, as  well as the EU directives which have been transposed in the MS. The legal framework requirements are sometimes  described at an abstract, non-technical level. Thus operators have to assess risks and security options and deploy  appropriate measures, depending on ICT architecture and technology deployed.  Generally, the security objectives in eHealth, according to the interview respondents of the current report, are  shown in the graph below.  Figure 8 – Security Objectives  Incidents Management  According to the findings of the conducted surveys and interviews, one of the top priorities in security appears to be  the management of incidents. Many countries pointed that incident reporting is the key for improving security  planning and measures. Some countries have already built helpdesks or reporting mechanisms. For example, in  Ireland, there are regional incident helpdesks and the incidents are usually managed by the vendors, while the  establishment of a single virtual helpdesk is planned. In Estonia the security officer of the eHelath Foundation reports  to the Foundation’s management board and Ministry of Social Affairs reports directly to the CERT Estonia. In France,  the eHealth authorities report directly to the security officer of the Ministry of Health. However, although there is  an established mechanism for reporting and resolving incidents in these countries, there isn’t in place a regulatory  framework and the action plan is based on informal guidelines. Furthermore, in Greece, the external eHealth services  providers are contractually obliged to report incidents.  Security and Resilience in eHealth  29  Physical and environmental security  The second top security requirement in eHealth is considered to be the physical and environmental security, which  is usually included in the acts covering the protection of the national infrastructures in each country. This is a very  wide subject which may refer either to the protection from physical disasters or to the mechanisms that protect  infrastructures from intruders and control the entrance to restricted areas where they can gain access to specific  information. A basic principle for the physical protection of data is to ensure that file servers are located in secure  areas safeguarded from unauthorized access and environmental threats such as fire, flood, loss of power etc.  Additionally, all equipment used to store or process critical data may be recorded and any movements tracked to  ensure that any theft or loss is detected in time49. In the UK, the physical security technologies that are used to  control the entrance in restricted areas and use IT systems and communication over IP networks can be divided into  three types: (a) Automatic Access Control Systems (AACS) (b) Closed Circuit Television (CCTV) (c) Intrusion Detection  Systems (IDS)50.  Network security  The network architecture and the network equipment (e.g. switches, routers, firewalls, anti-malware / anti-virus  servers, security patches and updates servers, domain controllers, application servers, workstations, support  laptops, event logging systems etc.) should be sufficient and meet the operational security requirements. On the  other hand, network security also relates to secure data transmission. Therefore in many countries a secure  connection platform is established exclusively for e-government or eHealth network. For example, in Ireland a  platform was built for the exchange of health data, named Healthlink Online. It utilizes 128-bit SSL encryption and  digital, client and server, certificates are required to initialize a TLS session. Data sent via a TLS connection is  protected by encryption. It also employs the use of V-LANs, multiple firewalls and VPNs to ensure the data remains  as secure as possible.  Access control  A very significant priority for ensuring security in eHealth appears to be access control, as it is the instrument to  control data protection –both in terms of integrity and privacy- and ensure that the user who has access to a specific  information is well-trained and able to use it efficiently for the appropriate purpose. Some of the main requirements  for a secure access to patients’ data include51:  a) The use of a unique identifying reference for each patient (the NHS number or similar);  b) Access to the system permitted only where there is a “legitimate relationship” between the system user and  the patient;  c) Registration of all users with a central authority to obtain a smartcard and a pass code (chip and pin). For  example, in Estonia there is a three-level authentication system used (notably): (i) knowledge-based  authentication, where the server identifies the clients by their user names and passwords (ii) device-based  authentication, where the server identifies the client using a specified object, such as a chip card, magnetic  card or key (iii) biometrical authentication, where the server identifies clients by the voice, face, fingerprint  or retina.  d) Strict prohibitions on the sharing of access cards and passwords;  e) “Role based” access for every registered user which defines the extent to which information can be accessed  and amended. Staff will only be able to access as much information as is needed for the purpose of their  role, for example, a clinic clerk may only have access to administrative information;  49Information Security Policy of Scotland, NHS in Fife http://www.nhsfife.org/nhs/index.cfm?fuseaction=nhs.policydisplay&p2sid=4F3677D5-E613-00B6- CEBF46733EC2AD2E&themeid=E44C37C3-5056-8C6F-C003CD63C15D8FF0&objectid=9E398034-9B81-470D-8C3F113B70249902  50Physical Security over Information Technology, Guidance Document by the CPNI(Centre for the Protection of National Infrastructures), March 2014  http://www.cpni.gov.uk/documents/publications/2014/ps%20over%20it%20issue%201%20final.pdf?epslanguage=en-gb  51 Electronic health records: data protection issues in Europe By Clare Sellars and Dr Amanda Easey IPM&T Group, McDermott Will & Emery UK LLP, issue of  BNAI’s World Data Protection Report, April 2008  http://www.nhsfife.org/nhs/index.cfm?fuseaction=nhs.policydisplay&p2sid=4F3677D5-E613-00B6-CEBF46733EC2AD2E&themeid=E44C37C3-5056-8C6F-C003CD63C15D8FF0&objectid=9E398034-9B81-470D-8C3F113B70249902 http://www.nhsfife.org/nhs/index.cfm?fuseaction=nhs.policydisplay&p2sid=4F3677D5-E613-00B6-CEBF46733EC2AD2E&themeid=E44C37C3-5056-8C6F-C003CD63C15D8FF0&objectid=9E398034-9B81-470D-8C3F113B70249902  Security and Resilience in eHealth  30  f) Introduce continuous manual or automatic auditing mechanisms of accesses made by staff as a requirement  i.e. did the doctor really have a patient relationship while accessing the patient information?  g) Data classification according to access levels. In Finland, the health information systems are separated into  two groups: Group A can access the central eHealth hub after certification; Group B cannot access national  services, but the system manufacturer must still make a self-declaration of compliance with guidelines, while  compliance of Group A systems is checked by a third-party certification authority accredited to do so by the  Finnish Communications Regulatory Authority. In Switzerland, there are three data classes, administrative  data that can be seen by all professionals, utility data that can be seen by all healthcare providers (e.g.  weight, laboratory test results, special follow-ups) and health data which are classified into three  subcategories: (i) basic data, which can be seen by the healthcare providers to whom the patient has granted  access (ii) stigmatizing data which can be seen only by healthcare providers, provided the patient has given  his consent (iii) secret data, which also can be seen only by clinicians, provided the patient has given his  consent;  h) An audit trail (accountability) whereby records are kept of all instances of access to a patient’s care record,  with alerts triggered when access is not justifiable. Specific individuals will be responsible for reviewing such  alerts and taking appropriate action;  Business continuity and disaster recovery  As the continuous provision of health services to patients is a major concern, it is very important to ensure systems  availability and recovery from incidents. In order to achieve business continuity in eHealth, organisations should  meet several requirements:  i. Regular data and software back-up procedures in order to provide contingency backup;  ii. Back-up copies of operational configuration files for the I.T. infrastructure including server and networked  equipment (IP address ranges, firewalls, etc.) should be kept in a secure place. This will allow the quick  recovery of the infrastructure if a disaster occurs52.  iii. The option not to deploy a central EHR repository in order to reduce the risk of illegitimate large scale data  availability (e.g. Austrian ELGA approach).  Supplier chain/third party  The supplier chain/third party security is a common major concern in information security which also affects eHealth  security. Several countries establish SLAs with ICT integrators, where security level requirements and incidents  reporting are included.  Awareness raising and training  Also, awareness raising and training of the personnel is of high priority in order to enforce the knowledge on the  information security processes and data protection procedures and consequently reduce human errors. In this  direction, a very prevalent security measure is the placement of an IT security officer in every healthcare  organisation. For example, HUG (Hôpitaux Universitaires de Genève) started employing a security officer five years  ago. Appropriate training on the permitted use of patient information according to the relevant requirements of  data protection law.  52Information Security Policy of Scotland, NHS in Fife http://www.nhsfife.org/nhs/index.cfm?fuseaction=nhs.policydisplay&p2sid=4F3677D5-E613-00B6- CEBF46733EC2AD2E&themeid=E44C37C3-5056-8C6F-C003CD63C15D8FF0&objectid=9E398034-9B81-470D-8C3F113B70249902  http://www.nhsfife.org/nhs/index.cfm?fuseaction=nhs.policydisplay&p2sid=4F3677D5-E613-00B6-CEBF46733EC2AD2E&themeid=E44C37C3-5056-8C6F-C003CD63C15D8FF0&objectid=9E398034-9B81-470D-8C3F113B70249902 http://www.nhsfife.org/nhs/index.cfm?fuseaction=nhs.policydisplay&p2sid=4F3677D5-E613-00B6-CEBF46733EC2AD2E&themeid=E44C37C3-5056-8C6F-C003CD63C15D8FF0&objectid=9E398034-9B81-470D-8C3F113B70249902  Security and Resilience in eHealth  31  Risk management  Risk management turns out to be a significant objective in eHealth security, as it includes, firstly, the identification  of critical assets and potential threats and, secondly, the risk analysis and impact evaluation of potential incidents  on healthcare delivery and patients’ safety53.  Further requirements  Furthermore, various approaches have been also stated, aiming at augmenting security:   Compliance with international standards. The use of ISO standards and relevant security measures, have  been referenced (i.e. ISO 27000 series and ISO 80001), especially in the deployment of internal information  systems (such as HIS/CIS). IHE security measures (e.g. IHE ATNA, etc.) have been mentioned, especially in  distributed use cases.   Internal and external security audits on a regular basis, in order to monitor the application of the security  measures and the traces of the access in personal data. Government eHealth Agencies may be mandated to  review Healthcare Operators and decide whether the latter need to take further protective ICT measures.  For example, in France, hospitals are audited every 2-3 years by an independent organisation, named High  Health Authority, in order to verify that their operation complies with the general and IT security standards.  If a hospital does not follow the security requirements, then it is not able to acquire the security certification  and has to stop accepting patients. In England, there is no specific framework for auditing, however there is  a licensing program in place and the hospitals/GPs are obliged to mark their progress (self-assessment) to  show that they comply with guidelines and policies (national toolkit).  53 eHealth for Safety Impact of ICT on Patient Safety and Risk Management, European Commission, October of 2007  Security and Resilience in eHealth  32  4. eHealth Use Cases  4.1 Overview of Use Cases  This study identified several Health IT implementation scenarios (i.e. use cases) taking into account current trends  in eHealth54, European Union policies in the domain55 and deployment models that are either widely accepted by  the eHealth community or they are expected to emerge in the near future. The basic scope of those use cases is to  study the impact of data integrity, data availability and resilience of eHealth infrastructures. Those use cases are  presented in the following table.  Table 4: eHealth's Use Cases  USE CASE SHORT DESCRIPTION RESILIENCE AND DATA INTEGRITY  Cloud services in  healthcare  Sharing information and medical processes  within a healthcare stakeholders’ network  by establishing public, private or hybrid  cloud infrastructures.  Public Sector entities usually have very secure  network facilities. In  most cases Private clouds are  established with high access credentials, encryption  and logging operating services  Big data and healthcare  analytics for public health  Healthcare management needs statistics  about the patient’s history and anonymized  patient data for public health and health  policy needs  Usually Health Data are not part of open data  schemes. Thus, indirect use of data for healthcare  analytics run on complex de-identification scenarios  taking into account patient consent policies.  Smart Hospitals  Intra-hospital wide access to the current  healthcare information (administrative,  transactional, medical)  Usually, hospital infrastructures are closed  networks restricted for administrative and clinical  support. Many establishments envision the use of  web and social media to interact with patients.  Currently such services are either in pilot phases or  under future considerations.  eHealth services  (ePrescription, Patient  summary, referrals)  Region/Nation-wide access to transactional  patient health information for multiple  purposes (patient summaries, electronic  prescription, patient consent management,  electronic orders and referrals, etc.)  This type of services have been introduced in most  21st century eHealth roadmaps, so that immediate  e-services can be provided to citizens and patients.  Those services often use the web as the networking  protocol as they rely mostly on interoperability of  systems and users. Such Interoperability assets are  of great importance. In most of the cases widely  accepted standards are proposed for example HL7,  IHE, DICOM, etc.  mHealth and  telemonitoring  applications  Sharing information about the medical  background and history of a patient by a  healthcare professional via remote access  medical devices and mobile applications  MHealth seems to be closely assessed at policy  level, mostly as it allows to shift healthcare systems  from healthcare delivery (illness treatment)  towards wellness and prevention (manage health  quality). Both certification and health technology  assessment are now in the focus before solving the  resilience of such eHealth services.  EHR/PHR operations An EHR is a systematic collection of health  history and status of a citizen. It can provide  EHR and PHR facilities are also widely defined as  milestones in national and regional eHealth  54http://www.iso.org/iso/home/store/catalogue_tc/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=63383,  55Antilope Project: http://www.antilope-project.eu/front/index.html  http://www.iso.org/iso/home/store/catalogue_tc/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=63383 http://www.antilope-project.eu/front/index.html  Security and Resilience in eHealth  33  information on administrative, financial or  statistical nature and quality control. There  are many definitions and interpretations for  the meaning of EHR. The basis of a worthy  EHR is the quality of information it collects.  Health care providers can improve the  quality, accuracy and availability of  information by increasing the speed of  processing claims, and by improving  productivity.  Personal health records (PHRs) contain the  same types of information as EHRs — diagnoses, medications, immunizations,  family medical histories, and provider  contact information — but are designed to  be set up, accessed, and managed by  patients.  roadmaps and currently such services are either  operational or under development.  Data integrity and resilience issues are considered  very important for the operations of those services.  Interoperability standards are used to solve the  operation equation (covering also security and  monitoring of data) so that those services can be  provided to the appropriate end users.  Cross Border Healthcare  Sharing information about the medical  background and history of a patient by a  healthcare professional in another country  Cross border healthcare has been introduced in EU  as required to secure universal quality of service  delivered across MS. Those settings are currently  operated on a pilot basis and will be established  until 2020 via the Connected Europe Facility  Programme. Security specifications are based on  commonly approved interoperability standards to  secure data integrity.  Respondents ranked the level of criticality of these Use Cases, from low, medium low, high and very high, according  to their experience and the contribution of these systems to their everyday job. The purpose of this criticality  assessment is to identify the Use Cases that are most valuable to the eHealth community and therefore focus our  future efforts in terms of research, good practices and recommendations.  The result of this qualitative analysis is depicted in the following diagram:  Security and Resilience in eHealth  34  Figure 9–Criticality of Use cases  The diagram above establishes some initial conclusions on the existing and future deployment models in eHealth:  1. Criticality is noted as of most importance in cases where services are already deployed or under  deployment, i.e. EHR/PHR operations, eHealth services, smart hospitals.  2. Criticality is correlated mostly to point of care delivery systems  3. Many respondents noted that some use cases may become dominant in the future but still have a lot of  procedural, legal and administrative issues to be solved. This is the case for cloud services, mHealth and  telemonitoring, cross border healthcare and big data and healthcare analytics.  Based on the above results, 3 uses cases are further analysed as interesting study cases that need to be assessed for  security and data resilience. Those use cases are the ones that are already in use or have an important impact in  matter of data integrity and resilience. The rest of the use cases are valid, but they are either expected to become  prevalent in a medium to long term timeframe, or they have already established data integrity and resilience  strategies from well-established protocols on which, end users and security officers have already specified  countermeasures and security policies.  Those use cases are:  1) Cloud services in healthcare: Cloud services are a new phenomenon in healthcare. Disruption of those services  may create discomfort, nevertheless, denial of service is usually not life threatening. Most respondents ranked  this use case of high or very high impact in terms of criticality  2) EHealth services (ePrescription, Patient summary, referrals): Lack of eServices operation may create discomfort  to end users. Most of the time those processes are transactional processes that deal with further value added  services and administrative tasks (reimbursement, etc.). Most responders noted the high or very high  importance of this use case, since such services are now the cornerstone of many national or regional health IT  strategies.  3) EHR/PHR operations: EHR/PHR act as a supportive mechanism to point of care information systems. Many EU  countries have deployed (for example, Luxembourg, Denmark, Finland, Estonia, France, Romania and other) or  Cloud services in healthcare  Big data and healthcare  analytics for public health  Cross Border Healthcare (e.g. epSOS) Issues  Handling mode)  EHR/PHR operations  (security, data integrity,  resilience)  eHealth services (ePrescription,  Patient summary, referrals, etc.) (security, data  integrity, resilience)  mHealth and telemonitoring  applications (security, data  integrity, resilience)  Smart hospitals (security, data  integrity, resilience)  Please rate the use cases below based on their criticality (criticality of  infrastructure, criticality of systems, criticality of data): (in average)  Low Medium Low High Very High  Security and Resilience in eHealth  35  are in the process of deploying such services (for example, Greece, Cyprus, Italy and other) aiming at providing  value added services to citizens, healthcare providers and the public health policy.  As such, they are gradually  gaining recognition in the end user communities and they are considered critical information infrastructures  while they acquire and reuse healthcare information.  4.2 Use Cases analysis  In this section, three use cases are analysed in detail. For each one of them, purpose and relevance are included.  The study also reflects the domains where those use cases have been or could be potentially applied, the scale (cross  border, national, regional or local deployment), the information that is exchanged and used and the key users,  stakeholders that actively take part in each case. Additionally, security parameters are mentioned such as potential  risks, security requirements, eHealth assets, and criticality. Finally, proposes some references of existing good  practices in each use case.  Cloud Services in Healthcare  TITLE CLOUD SERVICES IN HEALTHCARE  Purpose  Sharing information and medical processes within a network of healthcare stakeholders by  establishing public, private or hybrid cloud infrastructures.  Relevance  Healthcare professionals need access to the patient’s information. They are using smart  technology via open networks, mostly targeting at accessing securely pre-existing e-services. Other  type of cloud services incorporates use of social media or other technologies to create open  services with healthcare orientation (allocation of medical practices, second opinion services,  comparison of diagnostic protocols, transfer and translation services of health data, geolocation,  civil protection and other related services). Cloud services usually focus on open data services  especially for public cloud.  Domains   Medication   Laboratory   Radiology   Patient Summary   Referral and Discharge reporting   Participatory healthcare   Telemonitoring   Multidisciplinary consultation  Scale Cross Border, National/regional, inter-organisational  Information   Patient Summary   Patient consent   Healthcare transactions   Patient discovery   Healthcare documentation retrieval   Providers registries  Participants / stakeholders   Healthcare professional (HCP) all categories   Patients  Potential eHealth Assets   EHealth data centre /data room   Web Service (e.g. for ePrescription, eDispensation, patient summary, patient cross-referencing)   EHR Socket-based service (e.g., HL7 MLLP)   EHR Service (either socket or web service) deployed in a physically unsecure environment   Usage of unsecure communication channel in Hospital (e.g., unencrypted message exchange in  Wi-Fi networks)   eHealth information database   eHealth portal  Security and Resilience in eHealth  36   epSOS NCP to NCP WAN network   PKI infrastructure   Tele-surgery application & network   Cloud based application to store measurements and auto-alert the patient   Cloud based Clinical information system (CIS)   eHealth Web Service  Potential Risk   Network security   Systems availability   Lack of standardisation   Lack of interoperability   Lack of security expertise   Access control and authentication   Data loss   Other  o Data privacy  o reliable network infrastructure (especially mobile)  o Health IT has a lack of funding, which may lead to substandard quality levels. Moving to high-  quality managed services such as the Cloud may be harder. The cost of moving may offset the  cost benefit of the economies of scale. 56  Security Requirements   Health care providers must have a service level agreement in place with their cloud service  provider in order to  o Meet cloud service availability requirements  o be obliged to follow state privacy and security laws  o adhere breach notification requirements  o meet appropriate back-up and disaster recovery provisions  o meet performance requirements57  Criticality  High (cloud services is a new paradigm in healthcare. Disruption of those services may create discomfort  but denial of service is usually not life threatening), Most experts ranked this use case as high to very  high though.  Additional Remarks and  Challenges  This use case is not a high priority in the Member States. Some Countries have noted that they foresee  to use cloud based services for supportive and administrative tasks (document management, etc.) and  some of them foresee to assess the private cloud model in a very restrictive and controlled way to secure  sensitive data. This use case is highly regulated from upcoming EU guidelines, recommendations and  futures directives. Most countries will wait for those to be established before incorporating this use case  in their strategy. Nevertheless, mobile and web technological hype distinguish this use case since seed  capitals, investment funds and other evangelists foresee a fast growth of demand on such services. This  would require that this market be regulated to secure patient data integrity and avoid misuse of sensitive  information.  Challenges noted by experts include the need to properly define what cloud computing is in healthcare,  the needed legal background for the proper use of sensitive information, regulate the ICT market in the  domain to protect from illegal or improper use of information. Many experts clearly noted that, as things  are today, they would not invest in creating cloud based services. So technology is present but business  scenarios need to be validated both from an ethical point of view and a legal point of view. One such  business scenario that has been excessively validated is the chronic disease management using  telemonitoring services. This is a typical IoT - cloud based service scenario where sensor data are  aggregated, processed and distributed over the cloud. Telecom operators’ value-added service  departments have recently started piloting on such services.  Current  practices  Cloud computing is an emerging use case in Europe. Nevertheless some member states have envisioned  the use of such approaches. For example SPMS, the Portuguese eHealth competence centre is using  cloud based services for document managements and document processing. Cyprus intend to create a  private cloud for the implementation of the electronic healthcare record. In Greece the Greek Research  & technology network is implementing a cloud computing repository of health data.  56 COCIR eHealth Toolkit, Integrated Care: Breaking the silos, Fifth Edition,European Coordination Committee of the Radiological, Electromedical  and Healthcare IT Industry, May 2015  57http://www.covingtoneHealth.com/2015/04/moving-to-the-cloud-some-key-considerations-for-healthcare-entities/  http://intraenisa/cod/COD1/eHealth/2015%20project/drafts/Comments%20and%20intermediate%20del/Decision%202010/87/EC http://spms.min-saude.pt/english-version/ https://www.grnet.gr/el/node/518 http://www.covingtonehealth.com/2015/04/moving-to-the-cloud-some-key-considerations-for-healthcare-entities/  Security and Resilience in eHealth  37  EHR/PHR Operations  TITLE EHR/PHR OPERATIONS  Purpose  An EHR is a systematic collection of health history and status of a citizen. Moreover, it can provide  information on administrative, financial or statistical nature and quality control. There are many definitions  and interpretations of the meaning of the EHR. The basis of a good EHR is the quality of information it collects  Health care providers can improve the quality, accuracy and availability of information, increasing the speed  of processing claims, and thus improving productivity.  Personal health records (PHRs) contain the same types of information as EHRs—diagnoses, medications,  immunizations, family medical histories, and provider contact information—but are designed to be set up,  accessed, and managed by patients.  Relevance  The EHR/PHR can provide instant access to information such as medication history, clinical picture over time  and decision support, such as allergy alerts, and more. It can also be a registry of allocated repositories of  analytical medical information securely stored at the point of care, within the existing information systems  used there for care delivery and data storage.  Domains   Medication   Laboratory   Radiology   Patient Summary   Referral and Discharge reporting   Telemonitoring   Multidisciplinary consultation  Scale National/regional  Information   Diagnoses, medications, immunizations, family medical histories, and provider contact information  Patient Summary   Patient consent   Discharge Letters   Links to other more analytical healthcare information (medical imaging, doctor reports, etc.)  Participants /  stakeholders   Healthcare professional (HCP)   Patient  Potential eHealth  Assets   EHealth data centre /data room   EHR Socket-based service (e.g., HL7 MLLP)   EHR Service (either socket or web service) deployed in a physically unsecure environment   Private Healthcare Information (PHI) database   eHealth portal   PKI infrastructure   Cloud based Clinical information system (CIS)   eHealth Web Service  Potential Risks   Network security   Systems availability   Lack of standardisation   Lack of interoperability   Lack of security expertise   Access control and authentication   Data loss   Data integrity(data breaches, correct conversion from a paper-based filing system to electronic health  records, incorrect data entry by staff, cut-and-paste data entry, inadequate updating)   Other  Security and Resilience in eHealth  38  o Computer crashes resulting in data loss and access problems58  Security  requirements   Build service availability via component redundancy   Enhance administrative controls  o Update policies and procedures  o Guide employees through the stringent privacy and security training process  o Run background checks on all employees   Monitor physical and system access  o Create physically inaccessible systems to unauthorized individuals  o Have exigencies in place for data recovery or restoration  o Provide identification and verification requirements to all system users  o Access the list of authorized users  o Supply passwords and personal identification numbers (PINs)  o Provide automatic software shutdown routines59  Criticality  EHR/PHR act as a supportive mechanism to point of care information systems. As such criticality is Medium  to High. Most experts ranked this use case as very high  Additional Remarks  and Challenges  This use case is one of the dominant use cases now implemented at regional or national level. Some examples  have been further described in other sections of this document and further information are provided in the  annexes (country briefs). It is important to note that this use case is highly moderated by interoperability  standards and well established integration profiles such as the ones proposed by IHE. Some of those profiles  have a strong security and resilience approach to secure data privacy, data availability and non-repudiation.  In addition 27 of those profiles have been adopted as EU standard specifications under the 1025/2012 EU  regulation.  Current Practices  Most EU member states have incorporated EHR and or PHR approaches in their eHealth strategy. Some  examples (non - exhaustive) in this domain are:  1. the myKANTA pages and Patient data repository in Finland managed by KELA  2. the Dossier MédicalPartagé - DMP in France managed by ASIP Santé  3. the myDSP (dossier des soins partagé) from Luxembourg  4. the myHUG electronic health record of the Geneva University Hospitals  EHealth Services  TITLE EHEALTH SERVICES (EPRESCRIPTION, PATIENT SUMMARY, REFERRALS, ETC.)  Purpose  Region/Nation-wide access to transactional patient health information for multiple purposes (patient  summaries, electronic prescriptions, e-referrals, billing, etc.)  Relevance  Healthcare professionals need an accurate and actual overview of the patient’s continuity of care record and  specific administrative or medical procedures that are distributed in more than one point of care setting.

Most of the time though those processes  are transactional processes that mostly deal with additional value added services and administrative tasks  (reimbursement, etc..) so those service are no prerequisite to delivery of care at the point of care. Most experts  ranked this use case of very high criticality  Additional  Remarks and  challenges.  This use case is the most dominant one in all EU member states as they all have included the implementation  of eHealth services in their strategy either at a national level or at a regional level. As a consequence, this is a  use case requires further attention and support by providing guidelines and recommendations on handling  network security issues.  60http://homes.esat.kuleuven.be/~decockd/slides/20130601.privacy.and.security.concerns.ehealth.pdf  61GUIDELINES ON ePRESCRIPTIONS DATASET FOR ELECTRONIC EXCHANGE UNDERCROSS-BORDER DIRECTIVE 2011/24/EU  http://homes.esat.kuleuven.be/~decockd/slides/20130601.privacy.and.security.concerns.ehealth.pdf  Security and Resilience in eHealth  40  EHealth services rely on establishing thorough connectivity and interoperability at all levels to secure  information handling and exchange from one healthcare facility to another. Most end users and experts  currently use integration profiles techniques extensively, as the one proposed by IHE (between systems) and  Continua Healthcare Alliance (between devices). The European Commission has already validated this path to  provide quality interoperability services over network infrastructures and has accepted 27 IHE profiles as part  of the accepted specifications procurement under regulation 1025/2012.  Basic challenges here remain such as having adequate and trusted registries of information based on commonly  accepted terminologies and techniques. Appropriate solutions have been tested and have been put in practice  in many countries and regions such as Luxembourg, Greece, Italy, Portugal, Spain, France, Denmark, Finland,  etc.  In general eHealth critical infrastructures do not massively differ from normal eGovernment or other basic CIIs.  Healthcare has additional requirements in data privacy and patient consent domain (legal regulations) that may  disrupt the value chain of services in favour of security and not the end service. This in some cases means that  some services are so securely established that end user experience is tampered. Further analysis should be  proposed in assessing technologies, standards, and methodologies that would securely enhance end user  experience.  Current  Practices  Most EU member states have incorporated eHealth services approaches in their eHealth strategy. Some  examples (non-exhaustive) in this domain are:  1. The MedCom messages – digital exchange of health data network in Denmark  2. The Sundhed.dk – the official web portal of the public health services in Denmark  3. The ePrescrition system in Sweden managed by Swedish Health Agency  4. The ePrescrition system in Greece managed by IDIKA SA  5. The National Healthcare Information system managed by the Croatian Health Insurance Fund  http://www.medcom.dk/dwn5350 http://www.sundhed.dk/ https://www.e-prescription.gr/ http://www.hzzo.hr/en  Security and Resilience in eHealth  41  5. Recommendations  5.1 Recommendations  Based on the information presented in this study and given the status of eHealth security in the MS, we conclude  by providing the following recommendations for further work in this area.  Recommendation 1: Member States should conduct an asset identification and a risk assessment activity to  classify their critical eHealth infrastructures and services and develop a national catalogue.  Identification of critical eHealth infrastructures and assets is a process to evaluate several eHealth services (use  cases) and supporting infrastructures, as well as to determine which ones are critical. Definition of several Criticality  levels may also be an option. ENISA’s 2014 report on CII identification, having taken stock of practices followed in  EU, provides alternative methods towards reaching this goal. 62  It is critical to achieve a uniform and adequate security level throughout critical eHealth infrastructures. The  determination of such infrastructures and assets at a national level shall enable the systematic protection of the  latter, based on national rules to be followed uniformly. Moreover this approach may lead to the concentration of  protection efforts to the most critical eHealth infrastructures, based on a prioritisation scheme.  Defining what is critical can be a complex issue and the result may be disputable, given interdependencies between  services and infrastructures. MS may start with a simple approach in the identification of critical eHealth  infrastructures and follow an evolution process towards higher maturity. ENISA has made a good first step in this  report and listed some of the assets that should be considered critical.  Recommendation 2: Member States should introduce clear cyber security guidelines for the protection of their  critical eHealth infrastructures and services.  Define the minimum requirements for the protection of eHealth infrastructures and assets classified as critical and  include them in clear cyber security guidelines. Such guidelines may refer to specific use cases and technical  infrastructures and assets commonly deployed, in terms of their protection measures. Combined with the previous  recommendation, these guidelines could form the basis for the development of a standard protection level for the  critical eHealth Infrastructures and identified relevant assets.  Guidelines may not be observed due to budgetary limitations, lack of management commitment to eHealth security  as well as limited training & skills. However clear incentives can help bypassing these obstacles.  Recommendation 3: Member States and healthcare organisations should perform an impact/cost benefit analysis  of healthcare cyber security incidents and to use this as leverage for increasing investment on eHealth systems  and infrastructures security.  Senior management echelons need to be motivated to increase budget for investing on cyber security and assets  protection. The best way to explain this is to present the cost benefit analysis of the security incidents classified by  root causes, to indicate how big the loss is. The healthcare organisations should provide statistical analysis based on  actual facts, incidents that have caused also financial impact to the organisation, to convince higher management  that security should be considered a priority regardless of the national legal framework.  62ENISA, Methodologies for the identification of Critical Information Infrastructure assets and services, Dec. 2014  Security and Resilience in eHealth  42  Recommendation 4: Member States should develop incident response mechanisms to efficiently bring together  the healthcare organisations with the national cyber security competent centres.  An eHealth incident reporting mechanism, potentially part of a clinical incident reporting and alerting system, may  improve patient safety. Moreover, by effectively sharing such information at various levels nationally,  organisationally and clinically, collaborative efforts can be made to improve critical eHealth infrastructure protection  and patient safety. In practice, an eHealth focused Computer Emergency Response Team should be created, which  could potentially collaborate with the national CERT on incident handling. Feedback directly to the eHealth service  users (e.g. clinicians) is extremely important for their continued engagement. A culture that encourages reporting  and information sharing is needed.  In terms of eHealth incident handling and hazard control, further steps need to be taken:   Systems for reporting and analysing incidents both locally and nationally,   A good in-depth analysis process to establish root causes for selected individual incidents and aggregate  incident reviews, thus enabling learning,   A process to ensure that actions are implemented and corresponding improvements in eHealth safety can  be demonstrated,   Redefinition of compensation systems (punitive or non-punitive) and their impact on the patient safety  culture and achievements.  Recommendation 5: Member States and healthcare organisations should setup an information sharing  mechanism to start exchanging knowledge and lessons learnt on cyber security issues i.e. how they mitigate  incidents, which are the security measures they take etc.  Information sharing is a very important component when building frameworks at a national level. Bringing  stakeholders from the private and public sector, the users, the general practitioners, associations of pharmacists etc.  would result in better depicting the current situation in the country, the gaps, the needs and thus developing  concrete security requirements for the security and resilience of eHealth systems and services.  Recommendation 6: European Commission should encourage the development of baseline security measures for  eHealth critical infrastructures and services. This should be done in coordination with the competent centres and  the healthcare organisations operating the critical infrastructures.  To offer assistance to the healthcare practitioners and bodies, baseline security measures could be set by competent  European authorities (national regulators, national security agencies etc.). Depending on the existing frameworks,  these could be binding and mandatory through ad hoc legislation (thus requiring monitoring and auditing  mechanisms to be in place) or through non-mandatory guidelines. Depending also on the maturity levels the security  measures should be able to cover all different levels of sophistication in the systems.  Recommendation 7: Member States need to implement widely accepted security standards to achieve  interoperability.  Define a set of must have integration profiles to establish secure connections over the network, specifically in the  domains of audit logs, data encryption, TSL assertions, access rights policy, eID, healthcare providers’ registries, and  many more related to data integrity and resilience of systems.  Having a common guideline on the way to ensure correct interoperability will gradually increase end user experience  and acceptance of new type of services that are meant to run over open networks and not in closed and restricted  networks.  Security and Resilience in eHealth  43  Recommendation 8: Member States should invest in raising awareness of the citizens and healthcare  organisations in providing cyber security training to personnel and users.  One of the greatest gaps identified in this study is the lack of expertise and knowledge on cyber security, with  consequent risks for the people involved in healthcare. Officers working in the competent authorities and the  healthcare units (hospitals, clinics etc.) should understand the concepts of cyber security risks to be able to protect  the critical assets.  Recommendation 9: Member States policy makers should make sure that eHealth should align with the national  CIIP strategy and with the National Cyber Security Strategy (NCSS).  The NCSS is the policy document that describes the activities the country should take to enhance cyber security at a  national level in the public, private sector and citizens. One of the most important objectives of the NCSS is Critical  Information Infrastructures Protection (included in 90% of the existing EU NCSS63). As healthcare is considered a  critical information infrastructure, any ehealth strategy should be aligned with the national policy documents and  activities. This applies to all MS the ones that have already a strategy and the ones in process of creating one,  including this way ehealth systems security and protection in the national priorities.  5.2 Future work  In more detail, the study identified also several areas where future work needs to be done:  1. Guidelines need to be created concerning CIIP in eHealth since many countries do not have a specific policy  in the domain.  2. Further analysis on the factors which govern the criticality of eHealth services and infrastructures (e.g. the  nature of interdependencies). Goal is to produce a guideline on methods to apply in order to formally  identify critical eHealth infrastructures.  3. Further drill down on specific eHealth use cases of interest (review the technology and architecture used,  the specific threat and risk mitigation measures to be taken). More specifically to thoroughly study the Cloud  implementation in healthcare, presenting the related challenges and opportunities.  4. As eHealth is a prominent sector for automation and it can be supported by Smart solutions, a specific  analysis on the Smart Hospitals pilots from the cyber security perspective should be considered.  63 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/national-cyber-security-strategies-ncsss/national-cyber-security-strategies-in-the- world  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/national-cyber-security-strategies-ncsss/national-cyber-security-strategies-in-the-world https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/national-cyber-security-strategies-ncsss/national-cyber-security-strategies-in-the-world  Security and Resilience in eHealth  44  6.

This exists in research  institutes, laboratories or university hospitals and not only.  Clinical data repository  is a real time database that consolidates data from a variety of clinical sources to present a unified  view of a single patient.  eHealth Interoperability  is a characteristic of an ICT enabled system or service in the healthcare domain that allows its user  to exchange, understand and act on citizens/patients and other health-related information and  knowledge in a commonly interpreted way. In other words, it is a means of crossing linguistic,  cultural, professional, jurisdictional and geographical border in eHealth.  e-Services in healthcare  are all electronic services together comprise integrated ICT supported health services to citizens.  Examples of such services are electronic identification, authentication and authorisation services,  telemonitoring, access to electronic health records, ePrescribing, e-dispensation and e- reimbursement.  Healthcare  means health services provided by health professionals to patients to assess, maintain or restore  their state of health, including the prescription, dispensation and provision of medicinal products  and medical devices  Interoperability  The ability of disparate and diverse organisations to interact towards mutually beneficial and agreed  common goals, involving the sharing of information and knowledge between the organisations,  through the business processes they support, by means of the exchange of data between their  respective ICT systems. It is also the capability to communicate, execute programs, or transfer data  Security and Resilience in eHealth  47  among various functional units in a manner that requires the user to have little or no knowledge of  the unique characteristics of those units (ISO/IEC 2382-01).  Laboratory  is a place equipped for making tests or doing experimental work. A clinical laboratory is specialised  laboratory for examination of materials derived from the human body (such as fluids, tissues, or  cells) for the purpose of providing information on diagnosis, prognosis, prevention, or treatment of  disease. Usually clinical laboratories are equipped with a Laboratory Information Management  System (LIMS), sometimes referred to as a Laboratory Information System (LIS) or Laboratory  Management System (LMS). It is a software-based laboratory and information management system  with features that support a modern laboratory's operations. Key features include — but are not  limited to — workflow and data tracking support, flexible architecture, and data exchange  interfaces, which fully \"support its use in regulated environments.  Prescription  means a prescription for a medicinal product or for a medical device issued by a member of a  regulated health profession within the meaning of Article 3(1) (a) of Directive 2005/36/EC who is  legally entitled to do so in the Member State in which the prescription is issued.  Radiology  is the science of radioactive substances and high-energy radiations and a branch of medicine that  deals with diagnostic images of anatomic structures made through the use of electromagnetic  radiation or sound waves and that treats disease through the use of radioactive compounds.  Radiological imaging techniques include x-rays, CT scans, PET scans, MRIs, and ultra-sonograms.  Radiology departments in healthcare institutions operate radiology information systems (RIS). An  RIS is a computerized database used by radiology departments to store, manipulate, and distribute  patient radiological data and imagery. The system generally consists of patient tracking and  scheduling, result reporting and image tracking capabilities. RIS complements HIS (Hospital  Information Systems), and is critical to efficient workflow to radiology practices.  Telemonitoring  is defined as the use of information technology to monitor patients at a distance. It is the ongoing  assessment of a condition—in particular cardiac arrhythmias and/or other objectively measurable  indicators of disease (e.g., heart failure)—by sensors attached to the patient, signals from which are  ported wirelessly to a central station or “node” where abnormalities will trigger a response by  healthcare workers.

In a recent  ENISA study, twelve out of eighteen Member States (MS) that participated in the survey- consider healthcare as a  critical sector, therefore they should take all appropriate measures to protect their ICT systems and assets2.  The scope and governance model of eHealth services may vary in the Member States (MS); it might be implemented  as centralised or even decentralised and may be extended, offering cross-border services. Additionally, critical assets  identification in the healthcare systems and infrastructures may be based on different criteria, such as business  continuity, data security and integrity, services availability, eHealth security policy and legislation. Moreover usual  practices, cyber security challenges, approaches to mitigate risks, and requirements for the eHealth infrastructures  may converge, diverge or be inadequate.  The aim of this study is to investigate the approaches and measures MS take to protect critical healthcare systems,  having as a main goal improved healthcare and patient safety. In that respect this study analyses:   The policy context in Europe and the legislation of the Member States   The perception of the Member States on critical assets in eHealth infrastructures   The most important security challenges   The most common security requirements   Relevant good practices that have been deployed in the MS for eHealth security  Cyber security incidents affecting eHealth services and infrastructures cause great impact. As a result this study  focuses on the availability, continuity and resilience of these systems and infrastructures. Issues like data integrity,  data protection and data confidentiality are always important when we talk about eHealth, however this study aims  at presenting another side of the same coin. It is important to analyse these systems from the availability and  resilience angle to understand how great the societal impact could be should, for example, a network supporting 3- 4 regional hospitals not be available.  To better understand the basic security challenges, features and applications in eHealth services, we focus on three  basic use cases that are considered critical (based on a survey): Cloud Services supporting eHealth, Electronic Health  Records (EHR)/Patient Health Records (PHR) and national eHealth services (i.e. ePrescription).  The following recommendations are targeted to Member State and Operators of critical eHealth infrastructures:  1. Member States should conduct an asset identification and a risk assessment to classify their critical eHealth  infrastructures and services and develop a national catalogue.  2. Member States should introduce clear cyber security guidelines for the protection of their critical eHealth  infrastructures and services.  3. Member States and healthcare organisations should perform an impact/cost benefit analysis of healthcare  cyber security incidents and to use this as leverage for increasing investment on eHealth systems and  infrastructures security.  4. Member States should develop incident response mechanisms to efficiently bring together the healthcare  organisations with the national cyber security competent centres.  1http://www.healthcareitnews.com/news/4-5-health-orgs-hit-cyber-crooks  2 ENISA survey on Critical Information Infrastructures https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/critical-infrastructure-and- services/Methodologies-for-identification-of-ciis  http://www.healthcareitnews.com/news/4-5-health-orgs-hit-cyber-crooks https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/critical-infrastructure-and-services/Methodologies-for-identification-of-ciis https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/critical-infrastructure-and-services/Methodologies-for-identification-of-ciis  Security and Resilience in eHealth  06  5. Member States and healthcare organisations should setup information sharing mechanisms to start  exchanging knowledge and lessons learned on cyber security issues i.e. how they mitigate incidents, which  are the security measures they take etc.  6. European Commission should encourage the development of baseline security measures for eHealth critical  infrastructures and services. This should be done in coordination with the competent centres and the  healthcare organisations operating the critical infrastructures.  7. Member States are encouraged to implement widely accepted security standards to achieve interoperability  and provide the possibility to move towards a uniform European certification scheme.  8. Member States should invest in raising awareness of the citizens and healthcare organisations in providing  cyber security training to personnel and users.  9. Member States’ policy makers should make sure that eHealth is considered as a CIIP issue and should align  with the national CIIP strategy and with the National Cyber Security Strategy (NCSS).  Security and Resilience in eHealth  07  1. Introduction  New, more effective and efficient healthcare processes are being introduced. However, in the era of “digital  Darwinism” (adapt to digital or lag behind) where technology, society and operation models rapidly evolve, the  healthcare operation participant experience (professional, patient) is often suboptimal. Better healthcare for the  patient at a highly controllable cost should be the main goal. The complexity of eHealth systems is very high, which  renders information quality (completeness, integrity), accessibility and availability a very challenging task. Emerging  healthcare data sharing schemes like EHR (Electronic Health Records) or PHR (Patient Health Records) as well as  cross-border scenarios further complicate the technological challenges and respective protection requirements.  The term eHealth is widely used in academia, the private and public sectors, standardisation bodies, manufacturing  organisations and vendors. eHealth systems extend from regional systems, where patients can access online basic  data on their treatment, to national schemes like ePrescription services or cross border eHealth information sharing.  In this report, eHealth is defined as the use of electronic means to acquire, transfer or store healthcare related  information and provide services used by health professionals and consumers3.  Since 20064, many Member States, recognising the importance of this sector and the need for automation, have  drafted national eHealth strategies which include important aspects for ICT adoption in the health sector; such as  EHR, ePrescription, healthcare smart IDs, legal and security issues for eHealth systems, etc. In these strategies health  information networks are considered a vital asset to protect; however in some cases no specific technical  requirements, nor security measures nor controls have been formally established.  ENISA acknowledges the significance of eHealth not only as a major contributor to the societal and financial welfare  of the EU, but more specifically as a critical information infrastructure and focuses for the first time on the security  challenges and risks of ICT of the health sector in the Member States. Given that healthcare services have been  recognized as a critical societal function5, it is important to analyse the degree to which various eHealth systems and  infrastructures are critical for the secure provision of healthcare services.  1.1 Policy Context  EHealth is a priority for the European Commission (EC): the overarching goals of the EC eHealth activities are:   To improve citizens’ health by making life-saving information available – between countries when necessary  using eHealth tools.   To increase healthcare quality and access by making eHealth part of health policy and coordinating EU  countries’ political, financial and technical strategies.   To make eHealth tools more effective, user-friendly and widely accepted by involving professionals and  patients in strategy, design and implementation.  In order to attain these goals, a set of policies have been put in place. Firstly, the EC has adopted the eHealth Action  Plan 2012-2020, which offers a roadmap for attaining four operational objectives: (a) interoperability of eHealth  services, (b) research, development and innovation, (c) uptake and wider deployment, and (d) international  cooperation.  3http://www.who.int/trade/glossary/story021/en/  4 http://ehealth-strategies.eu/  5EC directive on Critical Infrastructures (directive 2008/114/EC) http://ec.europa.eu/dgs/home- affairs/pdf/policies/crisis_and_terrorism/epcip_swd_2012_190_final.pdf  http://ec.europa.eu/health/ehealth/policy/index_en.htm http://ec.europa.eu/health/eHealth/docs/com_2012_736_en.pdf http://ec.europa.eu/health/eHealth/docs/com_2012_736_en.pdf http://www.who.int/trade/glossary/story021/en/ http://ehealth-strategies.eu/ http://ec.europa.eu/dgs/home-affairs/pdf/policies/crisis_and_terrorism/epcip_swd_2012_190_final.pdf http://ec.europa.eu/dgs/home-affairs/pdf/policies/crisis_and_terrorism/epcip_swd_2012_190_final.pdf  Security and Resilience in eHealth  08  Towards achieving the cooperation among the EU MS and the interoperability between electronic health systems,  the eHealth Network was set up by the Directive 2011/24/EU. The eHealth Network consists of representatives from  the 28 MS and its mission is to lead the cooperation among the MS, give direction to eHealth developments and  adopt guidelines (such as the Guidelines on ePrescriptions Dataset for Electronic Exchange).  Further support to the issue of interoperability is provided by the Digital Single Market Strategy, which was adopted  by the EC and defines eHealth as one of the critical sectors for which priorities for security and interoperability should  be set for the benefit of patients, health professional, health systems and industry.  In the same context, the EC issued on 28th of July 2015 the Decision 2015/1302 on the identification of “Integrating  the Healthcare Enterprise” (IHE) profiles for referencing the public procurement. This decision allows for the 27 IHE  profiles to be identified as ICT technical specifications eligible for referencing in public procurement. The 27 IHE  profiles are detailed specifications that optimise the selection of well-established standards describing the different  layers of interoperability (i.e. protocol communication, technical, syntactical, semantic and application levels) with  the aim to find interoperability solutions for exchanging or sharing health data. Hence, the IHE profiles have the  potential to increase interoperability of eHealth services and applications to the benefit of patients and medical  community.  Mobile health (mHealth) is a rapidly developing sub-segment of eHealth that covers medical and public health  practice supported by mobile devices. It comprises a set of technologies which will bring a more innovative care  access reducing healthcare costs at the same time. More specifically, mHealth includes the use of mobile  communication devices for health and well-being services and information purposes as well as mobile health  applications. The European Commission, having recognised the emergent role of mHealth in the transformation of  healthcare, published in April 2014 a Green Paper on mHealth that considers existing barriers and issues related to  mHealth deployment and analyses mHealth potential to maintain and improve patients' health and well-being and  encourage their empowerment.  At the same time, according to the EC Directive on Critical Infrastructures6, healthcare services have been recognized  as a critical societal sector and therefore, healthcare systems are considered as critical infrastructures that should  be protected by all types of threats, including cyber security attacks. Moreover, in the proposed NIS Directive,  healthcare is considered as one of the critical sectors vital for the society.  1.2 Scope and objectives  This study focuses on eHealth information systems and infrastructures as well as on the relevant assets that are  considered critical both for the society and the relevant stakeholder groups. As a starting point, this study aims to  showcase how the MS perceive cyber security in their health systems, which are the specific approaches they follow  and which are the measures they take to protect these systems. Examples of such systems are Healthcare  information networks and systems, EHR, online ePrescription systems (supporting the drug  prescription/dispensing/reimbursement cycle). Based on the criticality of these systems, the scope of this report  narrows down to the availability, integrity of assets and continuity of the services.  ENISA takes stock of how Member States perceive eHealth security, which are the governance models and the  specific requirements, and what are the measures they take to protect it. The aim of this study is to clarify the  eHealth systems security perception in the MS; to identify the gaps and also to recommend, based on good practices,  the next steps for the governmental authorities, the policy makers and specialists.  6 Council Directive 2008/114/EC of 8 December 2008 on the identification and designation of European Critical Infrastructures and the  assessment of the need to improve their protection: http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:32008L0114  http://ec.europa.eu/health/ehealth/policy/network/index_en.htm http://ec.europa.eu/digital-agenda/economy-society-digital-single-market http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=OJ:JOL_2015_199_R_0011 http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=OJ:JOL_2015_199_R_0011 https://ec.europa.eu/digital-agenda/en/news/green-paper-mobile-health-mhealth http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:32008L0114 http://ec.europa.eu/digital-agenda/en/news/network-and-information-security-nis-directive http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:32008L0114  Security and Resilience in eHealth  09  The objectives of this study are to:   Identify national legislation on cyber security and eHealth, the governing authorities and the service  provider organisation;   Assess the perceived criticality of the relevant infrastructures and assets;   Present the security priorities and challenges.  1.3 Methodology  The collection of information was conducted through two parallel activities: a desk research and a series of  interviews accompanied by on-line survey process, to effectively acquire and validate the feedback.   The desk research was focused on the use of ICT in eHealth, more specifically on cyber security risks,  challenges and measures;   The interviews with experts to collect analytical and granular information (country, regional briefs, strategy  and governance issues, security requirements and measures, CIIP, use case scenarios)   Additionally, the on-line survey targeted key experts of the field and was combined with the interviews, to  get more specific information on good practices.  The stakeholders involved7 (representing 18 EU MS and 2 EFTA countries) were either experts in cyber security  related issues or academics conducting research or operators within the field of cyber security in eHealth with the  following profiles:   Public institutions responsible for eHealth strategy   eHealth Competence centres   eHealth platform Operators (CIOs, security officers, end points staff, system administrators)   Academia   User Associations – Networking organisations   Standardisation Bodies   ICT Industry (suppliers)  To better understand security risks the study assesses specific use case scenarios, seen from the CIIP point of view,  based on the feedback received and the general perception. The study identifies actual instances of these scenarios  which were validated by the respective stakeholders.  1.4 Target Audience  This report targets public sector experts in national authorities i.e. Ministry of Health, Ministry of State Affairs,  competent Authorities (like eHealth national centres or cyber security centres) responsible for implementing the  eHealth national strategy with or without mandate on cyber security and CISOs, as it offers recommendation on  what are the steps to follow to protect their assets.  It is  also useful for eHealth services providers (for the public sector), Operators i.e. hospitals and practitioners that  use eHealth systems, as it provides advice on how they may implement security measures in their systems and what  they need to do to comply with the requirements of a security policy.  7 The specific contributions of each interviewee are intentionally left unmentioned, and the individuals are not directly quoted or linked to any given  statement.  Security and Resilience in eHealth  10  1.5 Structure  Following in chapter 2, an overview of policies and strategies on eHealth with specific reference to the Member  States is presented. The criticality of eHealth infrastructures, examples of  identified assets on specific use cases, as  well as the security challenges related to these use cases, are presented in chapter 3.  Chapter 4 analyses the proposed Use Cases in terms of their criticality and security challenges faced. This Chapter  also evaluates good practices in 3 uses cases that were assessed as the most prominent ones by the stakeholder’s  community. Chapter 5 present conclusions and elaborates some recommendations that could be seen either as  input for future works or as issues that need to be properly addressed by the member states.  For the reader’s assistance, a glossary of used terms is introduced in the Appendix. In Annex A, published as a  separate document, the reader can see the country reports, with information on eHealth systems and infrastructures  security in the 28 MS.  Security and Resilience in eHealth  11  2. eHealth Security in the Member States  2.1 Overview of national legislation  The first step to understand the perception of eHealth in the MS is to identify the landscape and how Critical  Information Infrastructure Protection (CIIP) is linked to eHealth. The approaches followed vary depending on the  priorities of each country. We categorise them based on the existence of an eHealth strategy, on the specific  legislation and on the way cyber security is included in the eHealth national framework.  In most countries an eHealth strategy exists, following the recommendation of the first EU eHealth Action Plan  requesting the Member States to setup such policy documents to describe eHealth specificities, bodies involved and  their responsibilities at a national level. Overall, eHealth infrastructures protection falls under the generic umbrella  of CIIP. Currently, there is no specific regulatory framework on critical eHealth infrastructure protection. This  information is presented in Table 1 (further information can be found in the annexed document named “Country  Reports – Current Status on eHealth in the Member States” with references).

The  main goal is to improve healthcare via informed treatment decisions. As previously described, the “data sharing”  stage involves the deployment of healthcare networks, which can securely retrieve patient data from various sources  and make them available to the patient and the responsible healthcare professional. Relevant schemes like EHR and  PHR, are currently trending in various MS. The eHealth models deployed in various MS vary, as analysed below:  Structural features of the model  National vs regional (or centralised vs decentralised) structures characterise eHealth in Europe. Moreover, hybrid  models and loose connection (also called federation) of regional structures can be found. These features may  influence both organisational and technological structures.  9 http://legeaz.net/PdfDoc/legea-95-2006-actualizata-2012.pdf  http://legeaz.net/PdfDoc/legea-95-2006-actualizata-2012.pdf  Security and Resilience in eHealth  15  In some MS the eHealth model is centralised with the mandated ministry assuming the overall responsibility,  whereas in other MS part and/or the entire responsibility is assigned to regional authorities. It should be noted,  that in a few MS, the regions develop their own eHealth legislation and/or eHealth systems.  Spain’s decentralised/regional [1] eHealth system  Health care in Spain is highly decentralised among the 17 Regions. The Ministry is responsible to coordinate and to assure  equality. The decentralisation of services, and the growing mobility of citizens make it necessary for services providers  (Regions) to collaborate beyond their boundaries, to provide quality services focused on patient safety.  Spain has a regional deployment of e-prescription system [2], interconnected at the national level (47,5 mil. eDispensations  performed in 2014 - 70% of dispensations). Spain also has a regional EHR deployment.  Spain’s model incorporates a powerful central switching point allowing for the addition of services required to the national  healthcare system, to ensure its sustainability and evolution.  Hospital-system driven  This approach, identified in one EFTA European country, puts in the driving seat one of the main eHealth  stakeholders, the hospitals. In this case, the hospital developed its own eHealth infrastructure and eHealth  application, including a PHR application.  Switzerland: Geneva HUG10  The university hospitals of Geneva deployed ‘my medical dossier, an online electronic health record where all the health data  that need to be exchanged between physicians, hospitals, laboratories and insurance companies are stored[3]. Hug was  created in 1995, when all public hospitals in Geneva were merged and now hug covers the whole spectrum of outpatients  and primary, secondary and tertiary inpatients care, including long-term rehabilitation and psychiatry. In 2013 60,000  admissions and over 900,000 outpatient visits took place, while 6,000,000 laboratory testing were done [4]. Mon dossier  medical today includes clinical and non-clinical processes into a patient-centered care service and covers complete order  entry for all orders including lab, drug, radiology, and care; unified clinical documentation; administrative information; access  management; imaging; and laboratory information. Mon dossier medical itself is always the result of a real-time query of all  relevant databases in the system [5].  Cross-border use cases  Cross-border use cases have been deployed within the EU-sponsored Large Scale Project (epSOS LSP). Pilot projects  on specific use cases have been evolving to official & standardized healthcare information exchanges, gaining  increased traction, through ongoing EU sponsored activities. In this case the deployment model is crossing European  Countries, while certain services are deployed centrally (e.g. value coding and transformation services, required to  provide semantic interoperability between MSs).  Cross- border e-Prescription and e-dispensing  between Sweden and Finland[6]  Within the EPSOS project, Finland and Sweden developed a pilot service between pharmacies in Finland and pharmacies in  Sweden. Around 10.000 user of the myKanta system in Finland gave their consent to participate in the pilot, which resulted  in one of the more successful pilots of epSOS. The number of exchanged electronic prescriptions was quite moderate but  many features and needs came up from this pilot, especially in the semantic domain where real case issues came up  concerning drug substitution, active ingredient matching and others. Most of those problems are currently dealt under the  project openMedicine, which will allow effective semantic interoperability amongst member states in the domain of  electronic prescription.  10 Exemplar case that is referenced throughout the report as good practice for eHealth services practices.

As an example, the NHS  in the England has suffered six data breaches every day since 201111 study states; hospital systems and networks  can be affected as every other network by viruses12 resulting into denial-of-service attacks and affecting for days all  operations in the hospital, a common phenomenon13; malicious physical attacks can compromise data integrity and  availability14; healthcare organisations are being targeted by sophisticated and highly organized cybercriminals who  are showing every day how vulnerable the eHealth systems are15. And the situation keeps getting more difficult.  Nations should realise how vital their national eHealth systems are and take all necessary measures to protect them.  Healthcare systems are becoming vulnerable to cyber security incidents due to various reasons; the volume of  information and the connection with patients dictates the use of automation and IT; the diverse nature of healthcare  information systems enables different devices to access the Internet (even though not designed for this) thus making  them easy targets; many outdated applications and systems didn’t include security as a priority requiring close  attention of the information security officers and finally the exponentially increasing attack surface is making  systems compromise an easier task. Combining these reasons with the fact that a breach of security can impact large  parts of the population16 makes eHealth a critical sector.  The analysis of the collected information is presented in this section: the most important reasons behind classifying  eHealth systems as critical are described, as well as some of the most prominent security challenges.  3.1 eHealth as a Critical Information Infrastructure  Not all MS consider eHealth as a critical sector; in some cases eHealth services formulate a different category of  emergency services and are not classified as critical, in other cases healthcare ICT services are not considered critical  as the environment is considered so isolated that any incident would have small impact. Criticality of eHealth  infrastructure is identified through three different perspectives:  a) The first perspective, healthcare business continuity, examines which assets (infrastructures and services)  are required to ensure baseline functionality of the entire eHealth system and vitality to society. Under  this perspective, central components and / or services that comprise the backbone of the eHealth system  are considered as critical. These components may include health provider or patients’ index service,  document registries, medical databases, eHealth specific identifier services etc.  b) The second perspective is data security and integrity. It examines data storage components, network  elements (e.g. an access router to a site hosting the eHealth application) for exchanging health data and  Identity and Access Management Systems (IAM). An analysis on specific assets for a given use case can be  found in section 3.2.  c) The third perspective focuses on availability. For example, if the unavailability of a service is creating high  impact to the society, such as loss of life, then this service is critical. In this perspective, applications like  EHR are considered to be critical, whereas network availability is crucial. Additionally, systems and services  11 http://www.computerworlduk.com/news/security/3586072/nhs-suffered-six-data-breaches-every-day-since-2011-study-finds/?intcmp=in_article  12 Dynes, Information Security and Health Care: A Field Study of a Hospital after a Worm Event, Technical Report, Centre for Digital Strategies, Tuck School of  Business, Dartmouth College, Hanover, New Hampshire, 2006.  13 http://www.volkskrant.nl/wetenschap/ziekenhuisapparatuur-slecht-beveiligd-tegen-computervirussen~a3946259/  14 https://www.secnews.gr/90665/isma%CE%AD%CE%BA%CE%B8%CE%B5%CF%83%CE%B7- %CE%B1%CF%84%CE%BF%CE%BC%CE%B9%CE%BA%CF%8E%CE%BD- %CF%80%CE%BB%CE%B7%CF%81%CE%BF%CF%86%CE%BF%CF%81%CE%B9%CF%8E%CE%BD-%CE%B1%CF%80%CF%8C-%CE%BA%CE%BB%CE%BF/  15 http://www.computerworld.com/article/2914741/cybercrime-hacking/researchers-hijack-teleoperated-surgical-robot-remote-surgery-hacking- threats.html  16www.computerworld.com/article/2975988/healthcare-it/more-than-80-of-healthcare-it-leaders-say-their-systems-have-been-compromised.html  http://www.computerworlduk.com/news/security/3586072/nhs-suffered-six-data-breaches-every-day-since-2011-study-finds/?intcmp=in_article http://www.volkskrant.nl/wetenschap/ziekenhuisapparatuur-slecht-beveiligd-tegen-computervirussen~a3946259/ https://www.secnews.gr/90665/isma%CE%AD%CE%BA%CE%B8%CE%B5%CF%83%CE%B7-%CE%B1%CF%84%CE%BF%CE%BC%CE%B9%CE%BA%CF%8E%CE%BD-%CF%80%CE%BB%CE%B7%CF%81%CE%BF%CF%86%CE%BF%CF%81%CE%B9%CF%8E%CE%BD-%CE%B1%CF%80%CF%8C-%CE%BA%CE%BB%CE%BF/ https://www.secnews.gr/90665/isma%CE%AD%CE%BA%CE%B8%CE%B5%CF%83%CE%B7-%CE%B1%CF%84%CE%BF%CE%BC%CE%B9%CE%BA%CF%8E%CE%BD-%CF%80%CE%BB%CE%B7%CF%81%CE%BF%CF%86%CE%BF%CF%81%CE%B9%CF%8E%CE%BD-%CE%B1%CF%80%CF%8C-%CE%BA%CE%BB%CE%BF/ https://www.secnews.gr/90665/isma%CE%AD%CE%BA%CE%B8%CE%B5%CF%83%CE%B7-%CE%B1%CF%84%CE%BF%CE%BC%CE%B9%CE%BA%CF%8E%CE%BD-%CF%80%CE%BB%CE%B7%CF%81%CE%BF%CF%86%CE%BF%CF%81%CE%B9%CF%8E%CE%BD-%CE%B1%CF%80%CF%8C-%CE%BA%CE%BB%CE%BF/ http://www.computerworld.com/article/2914741/cybercrime-hacking/researchers-hijack-teleoperated-surgical-robot-remote-surgery-hacking-threats.html http://www.computerworld.com/article/2914741/cybercrime-hacking/researchers-hijack-teleoperated-surgical-robot-remote-surgery-hacking-threats.html http://www.computerworld.com/article/2975988/healthcare-it/more-than-80-of-healthcare-it-leaders-say-their-systems-have-been-compromised.html  Security and Resilience in eHealth  17  that are directly linked to the patient’s care as diagnostic systems and Intensive Care Unit (ICU) and the  systems that aggregate information related to patient’s care are considered as critical as well.  In this study, to depict the critical assets in eHealth systems, we follow the approach as described in the diagram  below. First the critical eHealth service is identified. Then it is broken down to core applications, which are in turn  broken down into CII assets. This is a common approach the MS could adopt to decide their focus when classifying  eHealth infrastructures.  Figure 1 Steps to identify CIIs  However most MS have not developed a specific methodology, legislation or regulation for the identification of  critical eHealth infrastructures17. Rather, the identification and protection of critical eHealth infrastructures is based  on the general regulation and strategy for CIIP – wherever this is applicable.  As underlined during the stock taking, not all Member States have defined critical eHealth Infrastructures and  identified relevant assets. Therefore, the process to protect the latter is based mainly on efforts of each healthcare  Unit or system Operator.  3.1.1 National approaches  It should be noted that eHealth is not acknowledged as a critical sector in all Member States. In many cases, eHealth  is identified as part of a critical sector such as Healthcare services and/or ICT.  Countries that identify eHealth as a critical sector address the protection of critical eHealth infrastructures according  to the general legislation and guidelines that describe how national critical infrastructures should be protected and  how critical data should be stored, protected and handled. In many cases infrastructure criticality is handled  according to civil protection law, together with telecom infrastructure, transport communications, etc.  Austria’s eHealth regulation  Austria’s eHealth regulation is closely bound to e-government regulation (data protection act, CIIP law) as well as to civil protection law.  Common practice is that central state administration bodies (e.g. ministries that are responsible for the critical sectors) identify the  17https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/critical-infrastructure-and-services/Methodologies-for-identification-of-ciis  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/critical-infrastructure-and-services/Methodologies-for-identification-of-ciis  Security and Resilience in eHealth  18  critical infrastructures based on a defined process, maintain a database of critical infrastructures and prepare a risk analysis of the critical  infrastructure.  In most cases, the CIIP mandate lies within the organisation that is responsible for CIIP in general, while in very few  cases, an eHealth organisation has a CIIP mandate. If there is no such mandate, then the responsibility is assumed  by the organisation that is overall responsible for the public healthcare sector, e.g. the Ministry of Health. If there is  a national security agency, and no other competent authority has a mandate on cyber security, then a common  practice is that they provide cyber security expertise horizontally in all sectors.  Examples of CIIP approaches  In Greece CIIP is handled horizontally via the civil protection legislation under action programs such as Perseas and Xenocratis. In other  words this means that eHealth infrastructure is considered of critical impact if it becomes unavailable in case of emergency. However  since Greece hasn’t performed a national assets risk assessment, health care systems cannot be considered as critical information  infrastructures.  In another example, Estonia has a nationwide approach concerning IT system security and defer the responsibility of eHealth CIIP to  the Estonian eHealth Foundation. Although, eHealth is not considered as a CII in Estonia.  In Finland, the CIIs as well as all eHealth infrastructures are regulated by law: Act on the Electronic Processing of Client Data in Social  and Health Care 159/2007.  In Germany the new IT Security Law includes security measures for all critical information infrastructures, ehealth services are  considered critical. As BSI is the national security agency of Germany, they are the competent authorities to orchestrate the  implementation of the provisions required by the law, and to monitor them, provide guidelines etc.  A third approach would be the one based on voluntary initiatives/ measures by healthcare units not aligned to any  central or regional initiative (e.g. Geneva region EHR initiative leading the national EHR plan, 4th Greek RHA  Healthcare Units initiatives).  From this information we conclude that there is no specific scheme when talking about critical information  infrastructures protection governance, each country follows a model that is tailored to its needs. However it is very  important to underline that identification of the assets and the infrastructures should be done through cooperation  of the national authorities with the operators of the systems.  3.2 eHealth critical systems and assets  Having discussed the approaches followed in order to assess criticality, we present specific ICT assets which can be  identified as critical for the proper operation of an eHealth system. Given that the scope of eHealth systems is very  wide and the operational models and ICT implementations of a specific use case may vary, the attempt to analyse  and identify assets is based on examples, to identify through them significant assets which can impact the proper  operation of an eHealth system in case of failure.  Security and Resilience in eHealth  19  Figure 2 Criteria to assess criticality of assets  Operational models served by eHealth systems may vary in their functional aspects (e.g. a system may serve only e- prescription use cases, while another may serve both e-prescription & patient summary) and/or in legal aspects  since they have to follow the legal framework and organisational model of each MS. Modern heavy duty information  systems are characterized by a very high technical complexity and therefore technical implementation approaches  vary. Moreover, alternative design models may be followed when implementing systems (e.g. EHR systems have  been designed and implemented based on alternative ICT architectures with variant centralization degrees).  Based on the information received by the interviewees, assets considered as critical are:   Health Information systems, i.e. the information networks in the hospitals;   Clinical data repositories i.e. the databases in each hospital where information is stored locally;   Authentication server i.e. to perform access control and authentication of users;   Laboratory Information System (LIS)   Radiology Information Systems (RIS);   Picture Archiving and Communication Systems (PACS), i.e. transferring radiology results;   Electronic Health Record components;   Patient Health Record service;   ePrescription service;  We present below two examples of systems that were reported critical by all our interviewees, the EHR system and  the e-Prescription.  Example A: electronic health record (EHR) system  While there is sufficient support in academic literature and analysis, there is limited standardized architectural  design of an EHR. It is stated that there are centralised and distributed architectural options. Architectural options  are depicted in Figure 3. The HL7 EHR functional model (FM) defines a standardised model of the functions that may  0  0,5  1  1,5  2  2,5  3  3,5  4  Impact to society in case of breach (disruption, loss,  alteration etc) &ndash; human factor  Sensitivity of data Services affected (collateral damages)  Financial impact - reputation  Prioritise (1-5) the parameters based on which the  criticality of assets is assessed  Security and Resilience in eHealth  20  exist in EHR systems. From the outset, a clear distinction between the EHR as a singular entity and systems that  operate on the EHR – i.e., EHR systems is critical18.  Even though many definitions exist for EHR, the official ones, according to ISO TR 20514 health informatics -  electronic health record, are presented below.  EHR: A repository of information regarding the health status of a subject of care, in  computer processable form. An EHR provides the ability to share patient health information  between authorized users of the EHR and the primary role of the EHR is supporting  continuing, efficient and quality integrated health care.  EHR system: The set of components that form the mechanism by which electronic health  records are created, used, stored, and retrieved. It includes people, data, rules and  procedures, processing and storage devices, and communication and support facilities.  Several EHR architectures have been deployed throughout the world19. The most commonly recognized are: the  centralised /fully integrated model, the decentralised/federated model and hybrids of the two models. As depicted  in Figure 3, different architectural approaches are followed by those countries which have deployed EHRs. In the  centralised model all the responsibilities, including cyber security, are in the mandate of one body, this might be the  Ministry of health (MoH) or the national eHealth centre. They are also responsible for EHR, and all healthcare  organisations (hospitals, GPs etc.) are directly reporting to them.  On the other hand in the de-centralised scheme  EHR is powered by the operator but instances exist in the several healthcare organisations.  In the EU, the NHS (UK) has deployed a centralised EHR architecture (called integrated EPR20). Germany, Denmark,  Spain are deploying a decentralised EHR model based on a service oriented architecture, while the Netherlands are  deploying a federated EHR model21.  18http://www.hl7.org/implement/standards/product_brief.cfm?product_id=18  19 http://www.corepointhealth.com/geni/health-information-exchange-architecture-types  20 http://mthink.com/article/federated-and-centralized-it-architecture-models-for-portable-ehrs/  21Bernd Blobel, Head, eHealth Competence Center, University Hospital Regensburg, Germany, Jahrestagung der HL7 Benutzergruppe Schweiz,  Oktober 2012  Figure 3 EHR architectural models (see glossary)  http://www.iso.org/iso/iso_catalogue/catalogue_tc/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=39525 http://www.hl7.org/implement/standards/product_brief.cfm?product_id=18 http://www.corepointhealth.com/geni/health-information-exchange-architecture-types http://mthink.com/article/federated-and-centralized-it-architecture-models-for-portable-ehrs/  Security and Resilience in eHealth  21  An EHR focusing on continuity of the care record (containing various patient healthcare episodes of care and  respective results throughout time) will need to extract data from many sources (e.g. healthcare unit databases, e- prescription systems, healthcare practitioner medical notes) as depicted conceptually in a very simplified mode in  Figure 4 the ‘assets analysis’ below is based on the main ICT component categories.  Figure 4 EHR data flow  When data are not persistently stored at the main EHR application, which is a common design option, then there is  no single database asset involved. Therefore the resilience of the overall system is high, given that it depends neither  on a single data source (several data sources are involved), nor on a single central database asset. Listed below are  the critical assets that constitute the EHR system together with what will happen in case of failure and the impact  an incident would cause.

An e-prescription / e-dispensing system serves the patient’s need on the prescription and dispensing of medicine  and automate/optimize the process, which is depicted in a rather simplified mode in Figure 5. The first step of the  process is the patient visiting a physician, who examines the patient and prescribes medicine on the system (if  needed). The second step is the patient visiting a pharmacy, which dispenses the medicine to the patient.  Figure 5 E-prescription / e-dispensing core cycle  An e-prescription / e-dispensing system may commonly be a web-based application. Usually, e-prescription systems  are based on very thorough and analytical interoperability frameworks based on international standards that allow  secure and quality proofed information exchange between the systems at the different points of care. Such real  world examples are deployed in countries such as Denmark, Sweden, Greece, Croatia, Finland etc.  Even though actual ICT implementations are expected to differ, best of breed ICT approaches are commonly  followed, namely: redundant components at all levels to enhance resilience (three-tier  architectures/web/application/database tier), deployment of primary and secondary data centre sites, enhanced  perimeter and internal security measures (e.g. several types of firewalling techniques, audit logging at many levels,  SIEM tools).  Such a system may be serving tens of thousands of medical doctors and pharmacies, especially when deployed at a  national level. Therefore it has to be highly resilient and scalable. Service outages though not life threatening, may  cause serious distress to the society. Assets critical to its operation are depicted below.

EHealth faces many security challenges; the great  majority of which are common to any critical infrastructure. In the interviews conducted for the purposes of the  current report, the respondents were asked on which are the most important cyber security challenges in eHealth  infrastructures and systems. The results are depicted below:  Security and Resilience in eHealth  24  Figure 6 Security challenges  Systems availability  Systems availability is the basic feature for achieving continuity of electronic healthcare. It is about continuous  accessibility of critical health information by authorized professionals in order to ensure the best healthcare services.  Systems availability may relate to physical systems function (e.g. networks, storage) and affect significantly the  healthcare delivery. In HUG (Hôpitaux Universitaires de Genève), if the network is down, the healthcare providers  cannot access patient’s data and cannot prescribe. Generally, the more digitized the health sector in a country, the  more the health services are affected by interruptions in eHealth infrastructures. The HUG is highly digitized  (documentation, imaging, laboratory systems, patient administration systems). Therefore, network and information  system availability are considered to be very critical. Systems availability may also relate to the maturity of business  continuity infrastructure and process in place, namely, systems integration. A violation of the processes protocol  may lead to the interruption of services. A typical example is to experience an interruption because an operator  might proceed to an update without following the protocol. In this case, the impact on the continuity of services can  be really high. For example, in Estonia, if central services are interrupted, 1600 healthcare providers are affected.  Another parameter which may affect business continuity is the type of the model that is used in eHealth services. In  case this model is not patient-centric, a patient may easily have hundreds of separate, overlapping records in various  systems and this limits the availability of information22, a condition which affects patient safety and leads to  unnecessary duplication of tests and investigations, so it increases the cost of the services23. Under the umbrella of  systems availability falls also the application security for  Lack of interoperability  EHealth infrastructures include many diverse systems and applications interconnected at various scales i.e. a medical  device collecting clinical data can be linked in the same network that a computer uses to access Internet. A core  issue for an effective and secure use of these services is to ensure a high level of interoperability and guarantee that  22 Access Control and Integration of Health Care Systems: An Experience Report and Future Challenges, Lillian Røstad, Øystein Nytrø, The Second International  Conference on Availability, Reliability and Security, 2007  23 Developing National eHealth Interoperability Standards for Ireland: A Consultation Document, Health Information and Quality Authority, Ireland, 2011  0  2  4  6  8  10  12  Which do you believe are the most important security challenges  in eHealth infrastructures and systems?  Security and Resilience in eHealth  25  information is transmitted safely through individual information systems, health service institutions, healthcare  providers and patients24  and, on the other hand, that the recipient’s system is able to use the information received  in order to proceed in various actions25. For example, the vocabulary used in EHR, namely the terminologies, the  classifications, the metadata26, or the cloud services among different cloud service providers, local or external clouds,  must be based on universally applied standards and an agreed-upon framework or some open protocols/APIs for  secure information exchange and services integration27.The lack of interoperability may also affect the security  updates in an eHealth services network. For instance, some healthcare providers in Estonia still used Windows XP  until the previous autumn, while all the software companies were about to stop producing updates for this operating  system, so this was a significant obstacle to take all the necessary security measures for the stakeholders. In the  current report, 25% of the survey respondents claimed that there is no interoperability framework in place at their  organisation.  Access control and authentication  A recent study by KPMG28 showed that among the greatest vulnerabilities in data security is sharing data between  third parties and insiders (breaches by employees). This finding indicates access control and authentication as key  security features in eHealth infrastructures. Authentication is the initial stage of the users’ validation in order to  determine their identity which is necessary to ensure that they are authorized to access the system. Once  authenticated, the information level that they are allowed to view or share for organisational purposes is defined by  an access control policy29. Access control is one of the main safeguards for ensuring data privacy and integrity30. A  centralised system (e.g. an HIS) with limited external connection has a specific perimeter which needs to be  safeguarded. In such a case, internal user access control becomes a higher challenge than external access control.  On the other hand, a distributed EHR or a mHealth chronic disease management system needs to prevent  unauthorized access on data over the network. Apart from enforcing authentication and access control, the need to  retain at the same time a user-friendly system is of great importance since it helps avoiding errors introduced by the  user. Additionally, with respect to the prevention of inappropriate or illegal disclosure it is crucial for providers of  health data to be sure that parties who consume data enforce, in turn, access constraints conformant to the  purposes under which that data was provided. Therefore the definition and enforcement of access rules for health  data and services throughout clinical workflows is a precondition for any cooperative patient treatment31.  Data integrity  One of the most common cyber security challenges in eHealth is ensuring quality and integrity of the data that are  stored and exchanged for clinical and administrative purposes. Examples include clinical laboratory test results,  patient demographics, medication related information, radiology reports and images, pathology reports, hospital  admission, discharge and transfer dates, etc. Data integrity is crucial, as errors in personal or clinical data may affect  a person’s medical treatment, insurance or employability32. These errors are often related to incorrect entry by staff,  24 e-Health Cloud: Opportunities and Challenges, Eman AbuKhousa, Nader Mohamed and Jameela Al-Jaroodi, Future internet, 2012  25 E-QUALITY IN E-HEALTH, Stakeholders' reflections on adressing e-health, Health First Europe, 2010  26 Data Integrity in an Era of EHRs, HIEs, and HIPAA: A Health Information Management Perspective, AHIMA, Dan Rode, MBA, CHPS, FHFMA Vice President,  Advocacy and Policy,2012  27 Developing National eHealth Interoperability Standards for Ireland: A Consultation Document, Health Information and Quality Authority, Ireland, 2011  28 Health care and cyber security: Increasing Threats Require Increased Capabilities, KPMG, 2015  29Privacy Oriented Access Control for Electronic Health Records, Randike Gajanayake, Renato Iannella, Tony Sahama, In Data Usage Management on the Web  Workshop at the Worldwide Web Conference, ACM, Lyon Convention Centre, Lyon, France, 2012  30 Access Control in Healthcare Information Systems, Thesis for the degree of Philosophiae Doctor (PhD), Norwegian University of Science and Technology,  Trondheim, January 2009  31 http://www.ihe.net/Technical_Framework/upload/IHE_ITI_TF_WhitePaper_AccessControl_2009-09-28.pdf  32Ensuring Data Integrity in Health Information Exchange, AHIMA Thought Leadership Series, American Health Information Management Association, 2012 p.2  http://www.ihe.net/Technical_Framework/upload/IHE_ITI_TF_WhitePaper_AccessControl_2009-09-28.pdf  Security and Resilience in eHealth  26  incorrect conversion from a paper-based filing system to electronic health records33 34 and improper or insufficient  use of standard based healthcare information exchange protocols35 36 37.  Network Security  A fundamental challenge in securing eHealth infrastructures is considered to be network security, and according to  the interviewees, this is highly related to many security incidents. Network security becomes critical when the  security of other critical assets relies on the security of the network. This is a top priority when the eHealth system  is network based (e.g. EHR/PHR, cross border eHealth). Recent reports indicate that one of the main vulnerabilities  of an eHealth network are the inadequate firewalls by 27% and place the external attackers as one of the major  threats by 65%38, while the 81% of health care executives surveyed claim that their organisations experienced  attacks by at least one malware, botnet or other cyber-attack during the past two years and only half feel that they  are adequately prepared to prevent attacks39.  Security expertise and awareness  A critical parameter for achieving and maintaining a high security level in eHealth systems and networks appears to  be the security expertise. The security practices by personnel are considered a source of potential problems and  appear to be a significant challenge, as in some countries, like Austria, the human factor is considered the most  important cause of security incidents. Thus, ensuring that the security architecture and all the respective procedures  and measures that must be followed are well designed, understood and applied by all relevant stakeholders in an  organisation is of high importance. A critical factor which contributes to awareness raising is the appropriate,  adequate and sufficient organisational structure and especially the role of a security officer. Nowadays 20% of  healthcare providers don’t have a leader solely responsible for information technology security40 and -in some  countries, like Estonia- a security officer placement is an organisational structure mandatory by law only for public  sector. Therefore many concerns are raised for the private sector security practices, since the lack of this asset may  lead to misuse of security standards and a gap between security policy and work practices41 42. Finally, another major  concern regarding the lack of security expertise is that the 23% of organisations do not have a security operations  centre to identify and evaluate threats43.  Data loss  The digitalization of information and the high level of eHealth services penetration in the healthcare sector mean  that a significant amount of vital, personal and confidential data are stored in digital format. In this framework, the  protection of the data from loss is considered to be very important. On the other hand, sometimes it is impossible  to avoid ending up in such a critical situation (e.g. software and hardware faults, network faults, security attacks,  and natural disasters), so data recovery and the timeframe that it can be achieved is closely related to data loss.  Common causes of data loss are unauthorised access to clinical patient data by IT vendors and by healthcare  organisations personnel and the back-up policy44.

Standardisation, Compliance and trust  One of the main concerns in attaining security in eHealth infrastructures is the proper use and persistence to create,  maintain and enforce an interoperability framework so that integrated systems contributes to cost reduction in  eHealth46. Some experts expressed concerns around the applied security policy from the third-party providers. The  European Commission has foreseen this need and thoroughly studied it during the HITCH and ANTILOPE projects. In  some countries, like Estonia, providers from the private sector are not obliged to comply with a specific and detailed  security standard. Additionally, eHealth professionals in Estonia find the requirements defined in the data protection  act to be abstract, something that results in problems in practice.  Cross-border incidents  Cross-border eHealth services play a significant role, especially in the European framework of free mobility for  citizens across the EU, since it is one of the main instruments to reach globally the public health objectives ensuring  the safety of emergency care and the continuity of non-emergency care. The challenges that shall be tackled in order  to facilitate transferability of data in cross-border healthcare are mainly related to building a common  interoperability and access control and authentication framework47. For example, the Estonian ID-card is issued only  to citizens and residents of Estonia. The Mobile-ID requires activation with an Estonian ID-card; consequently  Mobile-ID is also available for Estonian residents only and there is no support for qualified certificates issued by  other countries48. The European Commission has invested substantial human and financial resources to prevent  cross border incidents from happening. The extensive use of integration profiles such as IHE ATNA, provide effective  logging of information exchange that minimise the case of cross border incidents.  Incidents management  Incidents management is a major challenge in eHealth  security. Although 75% of the respondent’s implement  security policies in their eHealth systems and/or  infrastructures, there are incidents that can be neither  anticipated nor avoided. Security incidents root causes  include, human errors, natural phenomena, malicious  actions (DDoS attack, MITM attacks, etc.) and system  failures (including third party failure, i.e. hardware  failure). System failures and human errors account  equally for the majority of the incidents reported.  Deliberate human intervention to disrupt the workflow  (i.e. malicious actions) also accounts significantly for  jeopardizing security, whereas the impact of natural  phenomena accounts for a small only portion of the  reported security incidents. It has to be noted that  human factor may also relate to malicious actions,  from the perspective of causing system holes by  negligence or oversights, which could lead to system inefficiencies and thus make the infrastructures vulnerable to  possible attacks. Human error also includes incorrect security practices by personnel which may result in security  45European Hospital Survey: Benchmarking Deployment of eHealth Services  46Developing National eHealth Interoperability Standards for Ireland: A Consultation Document, Health Information and Quality Authority, Ireland, 2011  47E-QUALITY IN E-HEALTH.

Therefore, eHealth organisations need to have an incident response capacity, in order  to timely identify incidents and restore and reconstitute systems and services in a trusted manner. Apparently, there  is a need to develop an eHealth specific incident reporting, classification and alerting mechanism in pan European  level. International good practices could be consulted towards this direction.  3.4 Information security requirements for eHealth  Security requirements, which the operators have to meet, are drawn from the legal framework of each EU MS, as  well as the EU directives which have been transposed in the MS. The legal framework requirements are sometimes  described at an abstract, non-technical level. Thus operators have to assess risks and security options and deploy  appropriate measures, depending on ICT architecture and technology deployed.  Generally, the security objectives in eHealth, according to the interview respondents of the current report, are  shown in the graph below.  Figure 8 – Security Objectives  Incidents Management  According to the findings of the conducted surveys and interviews, one of the top priorities in security appears to be  the management of incidents. Many countries pointed that incident reporting is the key for improving security  planning and measures. Some countries have already built helpdesks or reporting mechanisms. For example, in  Ireland, there are regional incident helpdesks and the incidents are usually managed by the vendors, while the  establishment of a single virtual helpdesk is planned. In Estonia the security officer of the eHelath Foundation reports  to the Foundation’s management board and Ministry of Social Affairs reports directly to the CERT Estonia. In France,  the eHealth authorities report directly to the security officer of the Ministry of Health. However, although there is  an established mechanism for reporting and resolving incidents in these countries, there isn’t in place a regulatory  framework and the action plan is based on informal guidelines. Furthermore, in Greece, the external eHealth services  providers are contractually obliged to report incidents.  Security and Resilience in eHealth  29  Physical and environmental security  The second top security requirement in eHealth is considered to be the physical and environmental security, which  is usually included in the acts covering the protection of the national infrastructures in each country. This is a very  wide subject which may refer either to the protection from physical disasters or to the mechanisms that protect  infrastructures from intruders and control the entrance to restricted areas where they can gain access to specific  information. A basic principle for the physical protection of data is to ensure that file servers are located in secure  areas safeguarded from unauthorized access and environmental threats such as fire, flood, loss of power etc.  Additionally, all equipment used to store or process critical data may be recorded and any movements tracked to  ensure that any theft or loss is detected in time49. In the UK, the physical security technologies that are used to  control the entrance in restricted areas and use IT systems and communication over IP networks can be divided into  three types: (a) Automatic Access Control Systems (AACS) (b) Closed Circuit Television (CCTV) (c) Intrusion Detection  Systems (IDS)50.  Network security  The network architecture and the network equipment (e.g. switches, routers, firewalls, anti-malware / anti-virus  servers, security patches and updates servers, domain controllers, application servers, workstations, support  laptops, event logging systems etc.) should be sufficient and meet the operational security requirements. On the  other hand, network security also relates to secure data transmission. Therefore in many countries a secure  connection platform is established exclusively for e-government or eHealth network. For example, in Ireland a  platform was built for the exchange of health data, named Healthlink Online. It utilizes 128-bit SSL encryption and  digital, client and server, certificates are required to initialize a TLS session. Data sent via a TLS connection is  protected by encryption. It also employs the use of V-LANs, multiple firewalls and VPNs to ensure the data remains  as secure as possible.  Access control  A very significant priority for ensuring security in eHealth appears to be access control, as it is the instrument to  control data protection –both in terms of integrity and privacy- and ensure that the user who has access to a specific  information is well-trained and able to use it efficiently for the appropriate purpose. Some of the main requirements  for a secure access to patients’ data include51:  a) The use of a unique identifying reference for each patient (the NHS number or similar);  b) Access to the system permitted only where there is a “legitimate relationship” between the system user and  the patient;  c) Registration of all users with a central authority to obtain a smartcard and a pass code (chip and pin). For  example, in Estonia there is a three-level authentication system used (notably): (i) knowledge-based  authentication, where the server identifies the clients by their user names and passwords (ii) device-based  authentication, where the server identifies the client using a specified object, such as a chip card, magnetic  card or key (iii) biometrical authentication, where the server identifies clients by the voice, face, fingerprint  or retina.  d) Strict prohibitions on the sharing of access cards and passwords;  e) “Role based” access for every registered user which defines the extent to which information can be accessed  and amended. Staff will only be able to access as much information as is needed for the purpose of their  role, for example, a clinic clerk may only have access to administrative information;  49Information Security Policy of Scotland, NHS in Fife http://www.nhsfife.org/nhs/index.cfm?fuseaction=nhs.policydisplay&p2sid=4F3677D5-E613-00B6- CEBF46733EC2AD2E&themeid=E44C37C3-5056-8C6F-C003CD63C15D8FF0&objectid=9E398034-9B81-470D-8C3F113B70249902  50Physical Security over Information Technology, Guidance Document by the CPNI(Centre for the Protection of National Infrastructures), March 2014  http://www.cpni.gov.uk/documents/publications/2014/ps%20over%20it%20issue%201%20final.pdf?epslanguage=en-gb  51 Electronic health records: data protection issues in Europe By Clare Sellars and Dr Amanda Easey IPM&T Group, McDermott Will & Emery UK LLP, issue of  BNAI’s World Data Protection Report, April 2008  http://www.nhsfife.org/nhs/index.cfm?fuseaction=nhs.policydisplay&p2sid=4F3677D5-E613-00B6-CEBF46733EC2AD2E&themeid=E44C37C3-5056-8C6F-C003CD63C15D8FF0&objectid=9E398034-9B81-470D-8C3F113B70249902 http://www.nhsfife.org/nhs/index.cfm?fuseaction=nhs.policydisplay&p2sid=4F3677D5-E613-00B6-CEBF46733EC2AD2E&themeid=E44C37C3-5056-8C6F-C003CD63C15D8FF0&objectid=9E398034-9B81-470D-8C3F113B70249902  Security and Resilience in eHealth  30  f) Introduce continuous manual or automatic auditing mechanisms of accesses made by staff as a requirement  i.e. did the doctor really have a patient relationship while accessing the patient information?  g) Data classification according to access levels. In Finland, the health information systems are separated into  two groups: Group A can access the central eHealth hub after certification; Group B cannot access national  services, but the system manufacturer must still make a self-declaration of compliance with guidelines, while  compliance of Group A systems is checked by a third-party certification authority accredited to do so by the  Finnish Communications Regulatory Authority. In Switzerland, there are three data classes, administrative  data that can be seen by all professionals, utility data that can be seen by all healthcare providers (e.g.  weight, laboratory test results, special follow-ups) and health data which are classified into three  subcategories: (i) basic data, which can be seen by the healthcare providers to whom the patient has granted  access (ii) stigmatizing data which can be seen only by healthcare providers, provided the patient has given  his consent (iii) secret data, which also can be seen only by clinicians, provided the patient has given his  consent;  h) An audit trail (accountability) whereby records are kept of all instances of access to a patient’s care record,  with alerts triggered when access is not justifiable. Specific individuals will be responsible for reviewing such  alerts and taking appropriate action;  Business continuity and disaster recovery  As the continuous provision of health services to patients is a major concern, it is very important to ensure systems  availability and recovery from incidents. In order to achieve business continuity in eHealth, organisations should  meet several requirements:  i. Regular data and software back-up procedures in order to provide contingency backup;  ii. Back-up copies of operational configuration files for the I.T. infrastructure including server and networked  equipment (IP address ranges, firewalls, etc.) should be kept in a secure place. This will allow the quick  recovery of the infrastructure if a disaster occurs52.  iii. The option not to deploy a central EHR repository in order to reduce the risk of illegitimate large scale data  availability (e.g. Austrian ELGA approach).  Supplier chain/third party  The supplier chain/third party security is a common major concern in information security which also affects eHealth  security. Several countries establish SLAs with ICT integrators, where security level requirements and incidents  reporting are included.  Awareness raising and training  Also, awareness raising and training of the personnel is of high priority in order to enforce the knowledge on the  information security processes and data protection procedures and consequently reduce human errors. In this  direction, a very prevalent security measure is the placement of an IT security officer in every healthcare  organisation. For example, HUG (Hôpitaux Universitaires de Genève) started employing a security officer five years  ago. Appropriate training on the permitted use of patient information according to the relevant requirements of  data protection law.  52Information Security Policy of Scotland, NHS in Fife http://www.nhsfife.org/nhs/index.cfm?fuseaction=nhs.policydisplay&p2sid=4F3677D5-E613-00B6- CEBF46733EC2AD2E&themeid=E44C37C3-5056-8C6F-C003CD63C15D8FF0&objectid=9E398034-9B81-470D-8C3F113B70249902  http://www.nhsfife.org/nhs/index.cfm?fuseaction=nhs.policydisplay&p2sid=4F3677D5-E613-00B6-CEBF46733EC2AD2E&themeid=E44C37C3-5056-8C6F-C003CD63C15D8FF0&objectid=9E398034-9B81-470D-8C3F113B70249902 http://www.nhsfife.org/nhs/index.cfm?fuseaction=nhs.policydisplay&p2sid=4F3677D5-E613-00B6-CEBF46733EC2AD2E&themeid=E44C37C3-5056-8C6F-C003CD63C15D8FF0&objectid=9E398034-9B81-470D-8C3F113B70249902  Security and Resilience in eHealth  31  Risk management  Risk management turns out to be a significant objective in eHealth security, as it includes, firstly, the identification  of critical assets and potential threats and, secondly, the risk analysis and impact evaluation of potential incidents  on healthcare delivery and patients’ safety53.  Further requirements  Furthermore, various approaches have been also stated, aiming at augmenting security:   Compliance with international standards. The use of ISO standards and relevant security measures, have  been referenced (i.e. ISO 27000 series and ISO 80001), especially in the deployment of internal information  systems (such as HIS/CIS). IHE security measures (e.g. IHE ATNA, etc.) have been mentioned, especially in  distributed use cases.   Internal and external security audits on a regular basis, in order to monitor the application of the security  measures and the traces of the access in personal data. Government eHealth Agencies may be mandated to  review Healthcare Operators and decide whether the latter need to take further protective ICT measures.  For example, in France, hospitals are audited every 2-3 years by an independent organisation, named High  Health Authority, in order to verify that their operation complies with the general and IT security standards.  If a hospital does not follow the security requirements, then it is not able to acquire the security certification  and has to stop accepting patients. In England, there is no specific framework for auditing, however there is  a licensing program in place and the hospitals/GPs are obliged to mark their progress (self-assessment) to  show that they comply with guidelines and policies (national toolkit).  53 eHealth for Safety Impact of ICT on Patient Safety and Risk Management, European Commission, October of 2007  Security and Resilience in eHealth  32  4. eHealth Use Cases  4.1 Overview of Use Cases  This study identified several Health IT implementation scenarios (i.e. use cases) taking into account current trends  in eHealth54, European Union policies in the domain55 and deployment models that are either widely accepted by  the eHealth community or they are expected to emerge in the near future. The basic scope of those use cases is to  study the impact of data integrity, data availability and resilience of eHealth infrastructures. Those use cases are  presented in the following table.  Table 4: eHealth's Use Cases  USE CASE SHORT DESCRIPTION RESILIENCE AND DATA INTEGRITY  Cloud services in  healthcare  Sharing information and medical processes  within a healthcare stakeholders’ network  by establishing public, private or hybrid  cloud infrastructures.  Public Sector entities usually have very secure  network facilities. In  most cases Private clouds are  established with high access credentials, encryption  and logging operating services  Big data and healthcare  analytics for public health  Healthcare management needs statistics  about the patient’s history and anonymized  patient data for public health and health  policy needs  Usually Health Data are not part of open data  schemes. Thus, indirect use of data for healthcare  analytics run on complex de-identification scenarios  taking into account patient consent policies.  Smart Hospitals  Intra-hospital wide access to the current  healthcare information (administrative,  transactional, medical)  Usually, hospital infrastructures are closed  networks restricted for administrative and clinical  support. Many establishments envision the use of  web and social media to interact with patients.  Currently such services are either in pilot phases or  under future considerations.  eHealth services  (ePrescription, Patient  summary, referrals)  Region/Nation-wide access to transactional  patient health information for multiple  purposes (patient summaries, electronic  prescription, patient consent management,  electronic orders and referrals, etc.)  This type of services have been introduced in most  21st century eHealth roadmaps, so that immediate  e-services can be provided to citizens and patients.  Those services often use the web as the networking  protocol as they rely mostly on interoperability of  systems and users. Such Interoperability assets are  of great importance. In most of the cases widely  accepted standards are proposed for example HL7,  IHE, DICOM, etc.  mHealth and  telemonitoring  applications  Sharing information about the medical  background and history of a patient by a  healthcare professional via remote access  medical devices and mobile applications  MHealth seems to be closely assessed at policy  level, mostly as it allows to shift healthcare systems  from healthcare delivery (illness treatment)  towards wellness and prevention (manage health  quality). Both certification and health technology  assessment are now in the focus before solving the  resilience of such eHealth services.  EHR/PHR operations An EHR is a systematic collection of health  history and status of a citizen. It can provide  EHR and PHR facilities are also widely defined as  milestones in national and regional eHealth  54http://www.iso.org/iso/home/store/catalogue_tc/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=63383,  55Antilope Project: http://www.antilope-project.eu/front/index.html  http://www.iso.org/iso/home/store/catalogue_tc/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=63383 http://www.antilope-project.eu/front/index.html  Security and Resilience in eHealth  33  information on administrative, financial or  statistical nature and quality control. There  are many definitions and interpretations for  the meaning of EHR. The basis of a worthy  EHR is the quality of information it collects.  Health care providers can improve the  quality, accuracy and availability of  information by increasing the speed of  processing claims, and by improving  productivity.  Personal health records (PHRs) contain the  same types of information as EHRs — diagnoses, medications, immunizations,  family medical histories, and provider  contact information — but are designed to  be set up, accessed, and managed by  patients.  roadmaps and currently such services are either  operational or under development.  Data integrity and resilience issues are considered  very important for the operations of those services.  Interoperability standards are used to solve the  operation equation (covering also security and  monitoring of data) so that those services can be  provided to the appropriate end users.  Cross Border Healthcare  Sharing information about the medical  background and history of a patient by a  healthcare professional in another country  Cross border healthcare has been introduced in EU  as required to secure universal quality of service  delivered across MS. Those settings are currently  operated on a pilot basis and will be established  until 2020 via the Connected Europe Facility  Programme. Security specifications are based on  commonly approved interoperability standards to  secure data integrity.  Respondents ranked the level of criticality of these Use Cases, from low, medium low, high and very high, according  to their experience and the contribution of these systems to their everyday job. The purpose of this criticality  assessment is to identify the Use Cases that are most valuable to the eHealth community and therefore focus our  future efforts in terms of research, good practices and recommendations.  The result of this qualitative analysis is depicted in the following diagram:  Security and Resilience in eHealth  34  Figure 9–Criticality of Use cases  The diagram above establishes some initial conclusions on the existing and future deployment models in eHealth:  1. Criticality is noted as of most importance in cases where services are already deployed or under  deployment, i.e. EHR/PHR operations, eHealth services, smart hospitals.  2. Criticality is correlated mostly to point of care delivery systems  3. Many respondents noted that some use cases may become dominant in the future but still have a lot of  procedural, legal and administrative issues to be solved. This is the case for cloud services, mHealth and  telemonitoring, cross border healthcare and big data and healthcare analytics.  Based on the above results, 3 uses cases are further analysed as interesting study cases that need to be assessed for  security and data resilience. Those use cases are the ones that are already in use or have an important impact in  matter of data integrity and resilience. The rest of the use cases are valid, but they are either expected to become  prevalent in a medium to long term timeframe, or they have already established data integrity and resilience  strategies from well-established protocols on which, end users and security officers have already specified  countermeasures and security policies.  Those use cases are:  1) Cloud services in healthcare: Cloud services are a new phenomenon in healthcare. Disruption of those services  may create discomfort, nevertheless, denial of service is usually not life threatening. Most respondents ranked  this use case of high or very high impact in terms of criticality  2) EHealth services (ePrescription, Patient summary, referrals): Lack of eServices operation may create discomfort  to end users. Most of the time those processes are transactional processes that deal with further value added  services and administrative tasks (reimbursement, etc.). Most responders noted the high or very high  importance of this use case, since such services are now the cornerstone of many national or regional health IT  strategies.  3) EHR/PHR operations: EHR/PHR act as a supportive mechanism to point of care information systems. Many EU  countries have deployed (for example, Luxembourg, Denmark, Finland, Estonia, France, Romania and other) or  Cloud services in healthcare  Big data and healthcare  analytics for public health  Cross Border Healthcare (e.g. epSOS) Issues  Handling mode)  EHR/PHR operations  (security, data integrity,  resilience)  eHealth services (ePrescription,  Patient summary, referrals, etc.) (security, data  integrity, resilience)  mHealth and telemonitoring  applications (security, data  integrity, resilience)  Smart hospitals (security, data  integrity, resilience)  Please rate the use cases below based on their criticality (criticality of  infrastructure, criticality of systems, criticality of data): (in average)  Low Medium Low High Very High  Security and Resilience in eHealth  35  are in the process of deploying such services (for example, Greece, Cyprus, Italy and other) aiming at providing  value added services to citizens, healthcare providers and the public health policy.  As such, they are gradually  gaining recognition in the end user communities and they are considered critical information infrastructures  while they acquire and reuse healthcare information.  4.2 Use Cases analysis  In this section, three use cases are analysed in detail. For each one of them, purpose and relevance are included.  The study also reflects the domains where those use cases have been or could be potentially applied, the scale (cross  border, national, regional or local deployment), the information that is exchanged and used and the key users,  stakeholders that actively take part in each case. Additionally, security parameters are mentioned such as potential  risks, security requirements, eHealth assets, and criticality. Finally, proposes some references of existing good  practices in each use case.  Cloud Services in Healthcare  TITLE CLOUD SERVICES IN HEALTHCARE  Purpose  Sharing information and medical processes within a network of healthcare stakeholders by  establishing public, private or hybrid cloud infrastructures.  Relevance  Healthcare professionals need access to the patient’s information. They are using smart  technology via open networks, mostly targeting at accessing securely pre-existing e-services. Other  type of cloud services incorporates use of social media or other technologies to create open  services with healthcare orientation (allocation of medical practices, second opinion services,  comparison of diagnostic protocols, transfer and translation services of health data, geolocation,  civil protection and other related services). Cloud services usually focus on open data services  especially for public cloud.  Domains   Medication   Laboratory   Radiology   Patient Summary   Referral and Discharge reporting   Participatory healthcare   Telemonitoring   Multidisciplinary consultation  Scale Cross Border, National/regional, inter-organisational  Information   Patient Summary   Patient consent   Healthcare transactions   Patient discovery   Healthcare documentation retrieval   Providers registries  Participants / stakeholders   Healthcare professional (HCP) all categories   Patients  Potential eHealth Assets   EHealth data centre /data room   Web Service (e.g. for ePrescription, eDispensation, patient summary, patient cross-referencing)   EHR Socket-based service (e.g., HL7 MLLP)   EHR Service (either socket or web service) deployed in a physically unsecure environment   Usage of unsecure communication channel in Hospital (e.g., unencrypted message exchange in  Wi-Fi networks)   eHealth information database   eHealth portal  Security and Resilience in eHealth  36   epSOS NCP to NCP WAN network   PKI infrastructure   Tele-surgery application & network   Cloud based application to store measurements and auto-alert the patient   Cloud based Clinical information system (CIS)   eHealth Web Service  Potential Risk   Network security   Systems availability   Lack of standardisation   Lack of interoperability   Lack of security expertise   Access control and authentication   Data loss   Other  o Data privacy  o reliable network infrastructure (especially mobile)  o Health IT has a lack of funding, which may lead to substandard quality levels. Moving to high-  quality managed services such as the Cloud may be harder. The cost of moving may offset the  cost benefit of the economies of scale. 56  Security Requirements   Health care providers must have a service level agreement in place with their cloud service  provider in order to  o Meet cloud service availability requirements  o be obliged to follow state privacy and security laws  o adhere breach notification requirements  o meet appropriate back-up and disaster recovery provisions  o meet performance requirements57  Criticality  High (cloud services is a new paradigm in healthcare. Disruption of those services may create discomfort  but denial of service is usually not life threatening), Most experts ranked this use case as high to very  high though.  Additional Remarks and  Challenges  This use case is not a high priority in the Member States. Some Countries have noted that they foresee  to use cloud based services for supportive and administrative tasks (document management, etc.) and  some of them foresee to assess the private cloud model in a very restrictive and controlled way to secure  sensitive data. This use case is highly regulated from upcoming EU guidelines, recommendations and  futures directives. Most countries will wait for those to be established before incorporating this use case  in their strategy. Nevertheless, mobile and web technological hype distinguish this use case since seed  capitals, investment funds and other evangelists foresee a fast growth of demand on such services. This  would require that this market be regulated to secure patient data integrity and avoid misuse of sensitive  information.  Challenges noted by experts include the need to properly define what cloud computing is in healthcare,  the needed legal background for the proper use of sensitive information, regulate the ICT market in the  domain to protect from illegal or improper use of information. Many experts clearly noted that, as things  are today, they would not invest in creating cloud based services. So technology is present but business  scenarios need to be validated both from an ethical point of view and a legal point of view. One such  business scenario that has been excessively validated is the chronic disease management using  telemonitoring services. This is a typical IoT - cloud based service scenario where sensor data are  aggregated, processed and distributed over the cloud. Telecom operators’ value-added service  departments have recently started piloting on such services.  Current  practices  Cloud computing is an emerging use case in Europe. Nevertheless some member states have envisioned  the use of such approaches. For example SPMS, the Portuguese eHealth competence centre is using  cloud based services for document managements and document processing. Cyprus intend to create a  private cloud for the implementation of the electronic healthcare record. In Greece the Greek Research  & technology network is implementing a cloud computing repository of health data.  56 COCIR eHealth Toolkit, Integrated Care: Breaking the silos, Fifth Edition,European Coordination Committee of the Radiological, Electromedical  and Healthcare IT Industry, May 2015  57http://www.covingtoneHealth.com/2015/04/moving-to-the-cloud-some-key-considerations-for-healthcare-entities/  http://intraenisa/cod/COD1/eHealth/2015%20project/drafts/Comments%20and%20intermediate%20del/Decision%202010/87/EC http://spms.min-saude.pt/english-version/ https://www.grnet.gr/el/node/518 http://www.covingtonehealth.com/2015/04/moving-to-the-cloud-some-key-considerations-for-healthcare-entities/  Security and Resilience in eHealth  37  EHR/PHR Operations  TITLE EHR/PHR OPERATIONS  Purpose  An EHR is a systematic collection of health history and status of a citizen. Moreover, it can provide  information on administrative, financial or statistical nature and quality control. There are many definitions  and interpretations of the meaning of the EHR. The basis of a good EHR is the quality of information it collects  Health care providers can improve the quality, accuracy and availability of information, increasing the speed  of processing claims, and thus improving productivity.  Personal health records (PHRs) contain the same types of information as EHRs—diagnoses, medications,  immunizations, family medical histories, and provider contact information—but are designed to be set up,  accessed, and managed by patients.  Relevance  The EHR/PHR can provide instant access to information such as medication history, clinical picture over time  and decision support, such as allergy alerts, and more. It can also be a registry of allocated repositories of  analytical medical information securely stored at the point of care, within the existing information systems  used there for care delivery and data storage.  Domains   Medication   Laboratory   Radiology   Patient Summary   Referral and Discharge reporting   Telemonitoring   Multidisciplinary consultation  Scale National/regional  Information   Diagnoses, medications, immunizations, family medical histories, and provider contact information  Patient Summary   Patient consent   Discharge Letters   Links to other more analytical healthcare information (medical imaging, doctor reports, etc.)  Participants /  stakeholders   Healthcare professional (HCP)   Patient  Potential eHealth  Assets   EHealth data centre /data room   EHR Socket-based service (e.g., HL7 MLLP)   EHR Service (either socket or web service) deployed in a physically unsecure environment   Private Healthcare Information (PHI) database   eHealth portal   PKI infrastructure   Cloud based Clinical information system (CIS)   eHealth Web Service  Potential Risks   Network security   Systems availability   Lack of standardisation   Lack of interoperability   Lack of security expertise   Access control and authentication   Data loss   Data integrity(data breaches, correct conversion from a paper-based filing system to electronic health  records, incorrect data entry by staff, cut-and-paste data entry, inadequate updating)   Other  Security and Resilience in eHealth  38  o Computer crashes resulting in data loss and access problems58  Security  requirements   Build service availability via component redundancy   Enhance administrative controls  o Update policies and procedures  o Guide employees through the stringent privacy and security training process  o Run background checks on all employees   Monitor physical and system access  o Create physically inaccessible systems to unauthorized individuals  o Have exigencies in place for data recovery or restoration  o Provide identification and verification requirements to all system users  o Access the list of authorized users  o Supply passwords and personal identification numbers (PINs)  o Provide automatic software shutdown routines59  Criticality  EHR/PHR act as a supportive mechanism to point of care information systems. As such criticality is Medium  to High. Most experts ranked this use case as very high  Additional Remarks  and Challenges  This use case is one of the dominant use cases now implemented at regional or national level. Some examples  have been further described in other sections of this document and further information are provided in the  annexes (country briefs). It is important to note that this use case is highly moderated by interoperability  standards and well established integration profiles such as the ones proposed by IHE. Some of those profiles  have a strong security and resilience approach to secure data privacy, data availability and non-repudiation.  In addition 27 of those profiles have been adopted as EU standard specifications under the 1025/2012 EU  regulation.  Current Practices  Most EU member states have incorporated EHR and or PHR approaches in their eHealth strategy. Some  examples (non - exhaustive) in this domain are:  1. the myKANTA pages and Patient data repository in Finland managed by KELA  2. the Dossier MédicalPartagé - DMP in France managed by ASIP Santé  3. the myDSP (dossier des soins partagé) from Luxembourg  4. the myHUG electronic health record of the Geneva University Hospitals  EHealth Services  TITLE EHEALTH SERVICES (EPRESCRIPTION, PATIENT SUMMARY, REFERRALS, ETC.)  Purpose  Region/Nation-wide access to transactional patient health information for multiple purposes (patient  summaries, electronic prescriptions, e-referrals, billing, etc.)  Relevance  Healthcare professionals need an accurate and actual overview of the patient’s continuity of care record and  specific administrative or medical procedures that are distributed in more than one point of care setting.

Most of the time though those processes  are transactional processes that mostly deal with additional value added services and administrative tasks  (reimbursement, etc..) so those service are no prerequisite to delivery of care at the point of care. Most experts  ranked this use case of very high criticality  Additional  Remarks and  challenges.  This use case is the most dominant one in all EU member states as they all have included the implementation  of eHealth services in their strategy either at a national level or at a regional level. As a consequence, this is a  use case requires further attention and support by providing guidelines and recommendations on handling  network security issues.  60http://homes.esat.kuleuven.be/~decockd/slides/20130601.privacy.and.security.concerns.ehealth.pdf  61GUIDELINES ON ePRESCRIPTIONS DATASET FOR ELECTRONIC EXCHANGE UNDERCROSS-BORDER DIRECTIVE 2011/24/EU  http://homes.esat.kuleuven.be/~decockd/slides/20130601.privacy.and.security.concerns.ehealth.pdf  Security and Resilience in eHealth  40  EHealth services rely on establishing thorough connectivity and interoperability at all levels to secure  information handling and exchange from one healthcare facility to another. Most end users and experts  currently use integration profiles techniques extensively, as the one proposed by IHE (between systems) and  Continua Healthcare Alliance (between devices). The European Commission has already validated this path to  provide quality interoperability services over network infrastructures and has accepted 27 IHE profiles as part  of the accepted specifications procurement under regulation 1025/2012.  Basic challenges here remain such as having adequate and trusted registries of information based on commonly  accepted terminologies and techniques. Appropriate solutions have been tested and have been put in practice  in many countries and regions such as Luxembourg, Greece, Italy, Portugal, Spain, France, Denmark, Finland,  etc.  In general eHealth critical infrastructures do not massively differ from normal eGovernment or other basic CIIs.  Healthcare has additional requirements in data privacy and patient consent domain (legal regulations) that may  disrupt the value chain of services in favour of security and not the end service. This in some cases means that  some services are so securely established that end user experience is tampered. Further analysis should be  proposed in assessing technologies, standards, and methodologies that would securely enhance end user  experience.  Current  Practices  Most EU member states have incorporated eHealth services approaches in their eHealth strategy. Some  examples (non-exhaustive) in this domain are:  1. The MedCom messages – digital exchange of health data network in Denmark  2. The Sundhed.dk – the official web portal of the public health services in Denmark  3. The ePrescrition system in Sweden managed by Swedish Health Agency  4. The ePrescrition system in Greece managed by IDIKA SA  5. The National Healthcare Information system managed by the Croatian Health Insurance Fund  http://www.medcom.dk/dwn5350 http://www.sundhed.dk/ https://www.e-prescription.gr/ http://www.hzzo.hr/en  Security and Resilience in eHealth  41  5. Recommendations  5.1 Recommendations  Based on the information presented in this study and given the status of eHealth security in the MS, we conclude  by providing the following recommendations for further work in this area.  Recommendation 1: Member States should conduct an asset identification and a risk assessment activity to  classify their critical eHealth infrastructures and services and develop a national catalogue.  Identification of critical eHealth infrastructures and assets is a process to evaluate several eHealth services (use  cases) and supporting infrastructures, as well as to determine which ones are critical. Definition of several Criticality  levels may also be an option. ENISA’s 2014 report on CII identification, having taken stock of practices followed in  EU, provides alternative methods towards reaching this goal. 62  It is critical to achieve a uniform and adequate security level throughout critical eHealth infrastructures. The  determination of such infrastructures and assets at a national level shall enable the systematic protection of the  latter, based on national rules to be followed uniformly. Moreover this approach may lead to the concentration of  protection efforts to the most critical eHealth infrastructures, based on a prioritisation scheme.  Defining what is critical can be a complex issue and the result may be disputable, given interdependencies between  services and infrastructures. MS may start with a simple approach in the identification of critical eHealth  infrastructures and follow an evolution process towards higher maturity. ENISA has made a good first step in this  report and listed some of the assets that should be considered critical.  Recommendation 2: Member States should introduce clear cyber security guidelines for the protection of their  critical eHealth infrastructures and services.  Define the minimum requirements for the protection of eHealth infrastructures and assets classified as critical and  include them in clear cyber security guidelines. Such guidelines may refer to specific use cases and technical  infrastructures and assets commonly deployed, in terms of their protection measures. Combined with the previous  recommendation, these guidelines could form the basis for the development of a standard protection level for the  critical eHealth Infrastructures and identified relevant assets.  Guidelines may not be observed due to budgetary limitations, lack of management commitment to eHealth security  as well as limited training & skills. However clear incentives can help bypassing these obstacles.  Recommendation 3: Member States and healthcare organisations should perform an impact/cost benefit analysis  of healthcare cyber security incidents and to use this as leverage for increasing investment on eHealth systems  and infrastructures security.  Senior management echelons need to be motivated to increase budget for investing on cyber security and assets  protection. The best way to explain this is to present the cost benefit analysis of the security incidents classified by  root causes, to indicate how big the loss is. The healthcare organisations should provide statistical analysis based on  actual facts, incidents that have caused also financial impact to the organisation, to convince higher management  that security should be considered a priority regardless of the national legal framework.  62ENISA, Methodologies for the identification of Critical Information Infrastructure assets and services, Dec. 2014  Security and Resilience in eHealth  42  Recommendation 4: Member States should develop incident response mechanisms to efficiently bring together  the healthcare organisations with the national cyber security competent centres.  An eHealth incident reporting mechanism, potentially part of a clinical incident reporting and alerting system, may  improve patient safety. Moreover, by effectively sharing such information at various levels nationally,  organisationally and clinically, collaborative efforts can be made to improve critical eHealth infrastructure protection  and patient safety. In practice, an eHealth focused Computer Emergency Response Team should be created, which  could potentially collaborate with the national CERT on incident handling. Feedback directly to the eHealth service  users (e.g. clinicians) is extremely important for their continued engagement. A culture that encourages reporting  and information sharing is needed.  In terms of eHealth incident handling and hazard control, further steps need to be taken:   Systems for reporting and analysing incidents both locally and nationally,   A good in-depth analysis process to establish root causes for selected individual incidents and aggregate  incident reviews, thus enabling learning,   A process to ensure that actions are implemented and corresponding improvements in eHealth safety can  be demonstrated,   Redefinition of compensation systems (punitive or non-punitive) and their impact on the patient safety  culture and achievements.  Recommendation 5: Member States and healthcare organisations should setup an information sharing  mechanism to start exchanging knowledge and lessons learnt on cyber security issues i.e. how they mitigate  incidents, which are the security measures they take etc.  Information sharing is a very important component when building frameworks at a national level. Bringing  stakeholders from the private and public sector, the users, the general practitioners, associations of pharmacists etc.  would result in better depicting the current situation in the country, the gaps, the needs and thus developing  concrete security requirements for the security and resilience of eHealth systems and services.  Recommendation 6: European Commission should encourage the development of baseline security measures for  eHealth critical infrastructures and services. This should be done in coordination with the competent centres and  the healthcare organisations operating the critical infrastructures.  To offer assistance to the healthcare practitioners and bodies, baseline security measures could be set by competent  European authorities (national regulators, national security agencies etc.). Depending on the existing frameworks,  these could be binding and mandatory through ad hoc legislation (thus requiring monitoring and auditing  mechanisms to be in place) or through non-mandatory guidelines. Depending also on the maturity levels the security  measures should be able to cover all different levels of sophistication in the systems.  Recommendation 7: Member States need to implement widely accepted security standards to achieve  interoperability.  Define a set of must have integration profiles to establish secure connections over the network, specifically in the  domains of audit logs, data encryption, TSL assertions, access rights policy, eID, healthcare providers’ registries, and  many more related to data integrity and resilience of systems.  Having a common guideline on the way to ensure correct interoperability will gradually increase end user experience  and acceptance of new type of services that are meant to run over open networks and not in closed and restricted  networks.  Security and Resilience in eHealth  43  Recommendation 8: Member States should invest in raising awareness of the citizens and healthcare  organisations in providing cyber security training to personnel and users.  One of the greatest gaps identified in this study is the lack of expertise and knowledge on cyber security, with  consequent risks for the people involved in healthcare. Officers working in the competent authorities and the  healthcare units (hospitals, clinics etc.) should understand the concepts of cyber security risks to be able to protect  the critical assets.  Recommendation 9: Member States policy makers should make sure that eHealth should align with the national  CIIP strategy and with the National Cyber Security Strategy (NCSS).  The NCSS is the policy document that describes the activities the country should take to enhance cyber security at a  national level in the public, private sector and citizens. One of the most important objectives of the NCSS is Critical  Information Infrastructures Protection (included in 90% of the existing EU NCSS63). As healthcare is considered a  critical information infrastructure, any ehealth strategy should be aligned with the national policy documents and  activities. This applies to all MS the ones that have already a strategy and the ones in process of creating one,  including this way ehealth systems security and protection in the national priorities.  5.2 Future work  In more detail, the study identified also several areas where future work needs to be done:  1. Guidelines need to be created concerning CIIP in eHealth since many countries do not have a specific policy  in the domain.  2. Further analysis on the factors which govern the criticality of eHealth services and infrastructures (e.g. the  nature of interdependencies). Goal is to produce a guideline on methods to apply in order to formally  identify critical eHealth infrastructures.  3. Further drill down on specific eHealth use cases of interest (review the technology and architecture used,  the specific threat and risk mitigation measures to be taken). More specifically to thoroughly study the Cloud  implementation in healthcare, presenting the related challenges and opportunities.  4. As eHealth is a prominent sector for automation and it can be supported by Smart solutions, a specific  analysis on the Smart Hospitals pilots from the cyber security perspective should be considered.  63 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/national-cyber-security-strategies-ncsss/national-cyber-security-strategies-in-the- world  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/national-cyber-security-strategies-ncsss/national-cyber-security-strategies-in-the-world https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/national-cyber-security-strategies-ncsss/national-cyber-security-strategies-in-the-world  Security and Resilience in eHealth  44  6.

This exists in research  institutes, laboratories or university hospitals and not only.  Clinical data repository  is a real time database that consolidates data from a variety of clinical sources to present a unified  view of a single patient.  eHealth Interoperability  is a characteristic of an ICT enabled system or service in the healthcare domain that allows its user  to exchange, understand and act on citizens/patients and other health-related information and  knowledge in a commonly interpreted way. In other words, it is a means of crossing linguistic,  cultural, professional, jurisdictional and geographical border in eHealth.  e-Services in healthcare  are all electronic services together comprise integrated ICT supported health services to citizens.  Examples of such services are electronic identification, authentication and authorisation services,  telemonitoring, access to electronic health records, ePrescribing, e-dispensation and e- reimbursement.  Healthcare  means health services provided by health professionals to patients to assess, maintain or restore  their state of health, including the prescription, dispensation and provision of medicinal products  and medical devices  Interoperability  The ability of disparate and diverse organisations to interact towards mutually beneficial and agreed  common goals, involving the sharing of information and knowledge between the organisations,  through the business processes they support, by means of the exchange of data between their  respective ICT systems. It is also the capability to communicate, execute programs, or transfer data  Security and Resilience in eHealth  47  among various functional units in a manner that requires the user to have little or no knowledge of  the unique characteristics of those units (ISO/IEC 2382-01).  Laboratory  is a place equipped for making tests or doing experimental work. A clinical laboratory is specialised  laboratory for examination of materials derived from the human body (such as fluids, tissues, or  cells) for the purpose of providing information on diagnosis, prognosis, prevention, or treatment of  disease. Usually clinical laboratories are equipped with a Laboratory Information Management  System (LIMS), sometimes referred to as a Laboratory Information System (LIS) or Laboratory  Management System (LMS). It is a software-based laboratory and information management system  with features that support a modern laboratory's operations. Key features include — but are not  limited to — workflow and data tracking support, flexible architecture, and data exchange  interfaces, which fully \"support its use in regulated environments.  Prescription  means a prescription for a medicinal product or for a medical device issued by a member of a  regulated health profession within the meaning of Article 3(1) (a) of Directive 2005/36/EC who is  legally entitled to do so in the Member State in which the prescription is issued.  Radiology  is the science of radioactive substances and high-energy radiations and a branch of medicine that  deals with diagnostic images of anatomic structures made through the use of electromagnetic  radiation or sound waves and that treats disease through the use of radioactive compounds.  Radiological imaging techniques include x-rays, CT scans, PET scans, MRIs, and ultra-sonograms.  Radiology departments in healthcare institutions operate radiology information systems (RIS). An  RIS is a computerized database used by radiology departments to store, manipulate, and distribute  patient radiological data and imagery. The system generally consists of patient tracking and  scheduling, result reporting and image tracking capabilities. RIS complements HIS (Hospital  Information Systems), and is critical to efficient workflow to radiology practices.  Telemonitoring  is defined as the use of information technology to monitor patients at a distance. It is the ongoing  assessment of a condition—in particular cardiac arrhythmias and/or other objectively measurable  indicators of disease (e.g., heart failure)—by sensors attached to the patient, signals from which are  ported wirelessly to a central station or “node” where abnormalities will trigger a response by  healthcare workers.

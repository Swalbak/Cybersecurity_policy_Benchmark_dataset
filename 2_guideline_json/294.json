From an  economic perspective, these evaluations might subsequently also address imbalances in the  market that could lead to suboptimal outcomes. Cybersecurity certification also touches upon  socio-economic aspects such as user trust and market responsibility of the owner of the  certificate. Further to that it also touches upon the need to provide a reasonable level of  cybersecurity for a ‘duty of care’ throughout the ICT product, ICT service or ICT process  lifecycle and the prevention of costs of a cybersecurity failure and subsequent loss of market  reputation. Therefore, the drivers for cybersecurity certification in the EU go beyond  cybersecurity requirements.  This study proposes a set of initial methodological steps to work towards a market  analysis on cybersecurity certification of ICT products, ICT services and ICT processes.  The performance of a market analysis on cybersecurity certification aims to contribute to  the EU cybersecurity certification framework and the planning activities of the European  Commission, the ECCG and the SCCG by identifying future areas for cybersecurity  certification.  The proposed steps described in this study are divided into four main sections and cover:  i) the identification of the context of the market analysis,  ii) the scope of the target of analysis,  iii) assessing the impact of a cybersecurity certification initiative and  iv) the identification of the available options and possible initiatives.  The goal is to be able to identify certification needs or ‘gaps’ in the market without relying solely  on input of stakeholders, but rather to provide evidence both from the supply and demand sides  while factoring societal and economic aspects.  This first attempt on proposing such a methodology is expected to evolve and to be further  developed and improved after the publication of the Union Rolling Work Programme by the  European Commission. It is expected that a more mature market analysis methodology will be  able to generate information that feeds the identification of the strategic priorities set by the  European Commission, the ECCG and the SCCG. The methodology also aims to provide  valuable input to the preparations of candidate cybersecurity certification schemes.

INTRODUCTION  The EU cybersecurity certification framework, established under the Cybersecurity Act (CSA)1,  is an instrument that aims to establish and maintain trust and security in Information and  Communications Technology (ICT) products, ICT services and ICT processes. Drawing up  cybersecurity certification schemes at EU level aims at providing harmonised criteria to carry out  conformity assessments to establish the degree of adherence of the products, services and  processes against specific predefined requirements. The Union Rolling Work Programme  (URWP) is a strategic document that allows industry stakeholders, Member States and  standardisation bodies to get a clear view on future EU cybersecurity certification schemes. It is  a multiannual overview of future candidate schemes and provides a midterm overview of the  defined future fields of certification, which the European Commission intends to submit to  ENISA. The URWP is drafted in close collaboration with the European Cybersecurity  Certification Group (the ‘ECCG’) and the Stakeholders Cybersecurity Certification Group (the  ‘SCCG’).  EU cybersecurity certification schemes will primarily address the level of cybersecurity required  for ICT products, ICT services or ICT processes. From an economic perspective, they could  address imbalances in the market that lead to suboptimal outcomes and could also touch upon  socio-economic aspects such as user trust, the duty of care of a manufacturer or provider and  prevention of cybersecurity failure to protect market reputation. Therefore, the drivers for  cybersecurity certification in the EU go beyond cybersecurity requirements. This broader  understanding and oversight would be beneficial to the policy and regulatory certification  activities of the European Commission.  Towards this direction, ENISA, conducted as part of its Annual Programming document 2020  (under Output O.5.1.2) a study on identifying a set of methodological steps to allow for a market  analysis on cybersecurity certification of ICT products, ICT services and ICT processes. While  preparing these steps, the following considerations were taken into account:  1. How to segment the cybersecurity market and what is the “Target of Analysis”:  Analysing the cybersecurity market is complicated looking at the number of security  vectors for ICT products, ICT processes and ICT services as well as the complex  nature of the supply chains and complex systems with a lot of ICT components. For  example, Connected and Automated Mobility (CAM) have numerous security vectors:  technical, processes, and principles. At the same time, they include complex structures  of components and create a multipart supply chain. Within this supply chain there are  also segments of analysis including sensors, smart devices/ Internet of Things (IoT)  devices, cloud computing, Industrial Automated Control Systems (IACS) and other  areas. Disentangling these levels for analysis is a crucial first step to conduct a market  analysis. Lastly, introducing cybersecurity solutions in one area may have knock-on  effects in other sectors of the economy, which also need to be taken into account.  2. How does the reasoning of the request influence the market analysis: There are  two basic reasons to conduct a market analysis: i) to determine whether an  cybersecurity certification based intervention is required, especially in an emerging  market or ii) to determine the performance of a new security scheme and whether it is  improving market performance. If the analysis is being conducted to understand  1 Regulation (EU) 2019/881 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17 April 2019 on ENISA (the European Union  Agency for Cybersecurity) and on information and communications technology cybersecurity certification and repealing  Regulation (EU) No 526/2013 (Cybersecurity Act) http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg/2019/881/oj  EU cybersecurity  certification  schemes are  expected to  touch upon  socio-economic  aspects such as  user trust.  http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg/2019/881/oj  CYBERSECURITY CERTIFICATION MARKET STUDY  April 2021  5  market performance, the methodology addresses issues related to cybersecurity  requirements, trust building or how it could help to address societal challenges.  1.1 SCOPE - OBJECTIVES  The objective of this study is to propose a set of methodological steps to allow for a market  analysis on cybersecurity certification of ICT products, ICT services and ICT processes. It  attempts to strike a balance, providing a list of steps and potential questions that can be asked  without creating a textbook on how to conduct particular types of economic analyses. It provides  a methodological toolbox that can be applied to the cybersecurity market. This toolbox includes  caveats about the use and limitations of individual tools, their combinations, what types of  conclusions can be reached with their help and what needs to be considered when interpreting  the results. Further to that, it incorporates potential costs (e.g. man/days and cost of data  purchase) associated with the use of the toolbox, whether there are interdependencies with  other activities and/or stakeholders and what quality assurance measures will be necessary to  produce better results.  1.2 STRUCTURE OF THE DOCUMENT  Chapter 2 of the study provides further context on the questions to ask before conducting a  market analysis, including understanding how to best scope the market of interest and how to  develop specific research questions that the market analysis is looking to answer. Chapters 3  and 4 provide step-by-step approach that can be used to guide a market analysis, providing a  set of indicative questions that could be used. Lastly, Chapter 5 concludes the study and  provides indications of how it could support the activities of the European Commission, ENISA,  ECCG and the ECCG. At the end of this report, a set of annexes provide indicative guidance for  specific aspects of market elements.  CYBERSECURITY CERTIFICATION MARKET STUDY  April 2021  6  2. CONSIDERATIONS PRIOR  TO THE ANALYSIS  2.1 SCOPING AND SEGMENTATIONS OF THE CYBERSECURITY  MARKET  Market segmentation is usually used to assess individual parts of a specific market2, providing  scope and boundaries to any analysis of relevant trends, evolution and performance. These  boundaries will be vital, depending on the scope of each analysis, because without clear  borders, a market analysis can quickly devolve into a massive exercise that touches on more  cybersecurity aspects than those really needed in the economy. For example, if an analysis  aims to cover Connected and Automated Mobility (CAM)3, it potentially includes4:   Connected services and off-board systems that are characterised by agile  development cycles involving the continuous evolution of services following staggered  releases; a large number of short-term projects generally based on scalable and  modular cloud architectures.   Various physical infrastructures, equipment, products and associated services,  vehicles and soft-mobility devices based on Operational Technology (OT),  electrics/electronics (E/E) architectures which must meet the security and technical  requirements associated with various types of quality validations or regulatory  approvals (e.g. vehicle type approval).   Wireless networks, including automated guided vehicles (AVGs) and human  interface systems (HMI) as equipment. Products and associated services are  connected by, for example, Bluetooth, Wi-FI/WLAN or other wireless techniques.  Such a scoping exercise is particularly necessary as policy-makers tend to have broader socio-  economic interests compared to a market analysis designed for private-sector entities, where  questions around the market are narrower in focus. A market analysis within the context of  cybersecurity initiatives needs to take into account the interests of (end) users, stakeholders,  employees, policymakers, and national authorities as well. Segmentation can take place along a  number of different aspects which include among others:   type of ICT product, ICT service or ICT process;   application area;   sector;   stakeholders involved and/or concerned;   technologies used and or deployed;   geographical boundaries of the market.  The final selection of the segmentation—the target of analysis—will depend largely on the  research questions that the activity is looking to answer. Criteria by which the target can be  scoped are determined by a number of factors, including:  2 Dolnicar S., Grün B., Leisch F. (2018) Market Segmentation Analysis. In: Market Segmentation Analysis. Management for  Professionals. Springer, Singapore. https://doi.org/10.1007/978-981-10-8818-6_2  3 Connected and automated mobility in Europe. European Commission.

The market needs that the analysis wishes to (potentially) address. This first  criterion can be a “chicken and egg” situation. One of the reasons to conduct a market  analysis is to understand areas where a market is not functioning in an optimal way. At  the same time, a market will generally only become of interest when stakeholders are  raising particular issues, or when innovative developments in technology seem  promising, which generally means that there is at least some starting point for why the  analysis is being conducted.  2. The data available for the study. Available data on market size, market shares, value  chains, revenues, market consumers and other relevant elements will be key to  providing the quantitative basis for a market analysis, and the more datasets that are  available, the easier an analysis becomes. As discussed in the following chapters,  datasets in high-tech -particularly for new technologies - can be quite difficult to reveal  or find (or may be of dubious quality).  Ideally, the source of information on how to segment a market and determine the final target of  analysis should come from available expert market knowledge, but for ‘undefined’ markets, this  may not be at hand. Under these circumstances, it will be necessary to seek out views from  various stakeholders. Stakeholders that may be consulted to help determine the scope are  indicatively listed below:   Industry experts from business associations: Business associations will have direct  links to the companies affected by cybersecurity issues, and they will have a broad  access to useful insights. Being associations they will also be able to provide an  overview of issues across a sector.   Industry experts from business consultants: Industry experts and business  consultants will come from multiple perspectives. They will tend to have a broad  overview of a sector, and they may also have more insight into the operational  elements.   Private Sector company experts: Companies will be able to provide direct  information on the costs to their business and will already have a good understanding  and prior experience with market analyses.   Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and start-ups: Getting direct access  to SMEs is an ideal data source as they will have the same insights into business  operations as larger operations, but will have experience on how to better access a  specific market and how to meet its needs. Start-ups often have a good view on new  markets to explore and are able to provide trendsetting information.   Consumers and consumer associations: Consumers can provide the requirements  and needs from the end user perspective and highlight the societal and possible  acceptance aspects and their needs.   Regulators and policymakers: Regulators and policymakers, particularly those  responsible for regulating a specific sector or policy area, will have insights into both  how the sector works, as well as in relation to other sectors and look into the broader  socio-economic impacts - both positive and negative - of activities within a particular  sector.   Researchers and academia: Academics will have a broad overview of the sector from  numerous perspectives. They are the most likely to provide research information on  possible market developments, or opportunities or information related to the  effectiveness of (new) analysis methods. They may answer questions in an  unprejudiced manner and can also highlight recent research results.  CYBERSECURITY CERTIFICATION MARKET STUDY  April 2021  8  2.2 DEVELOPING RESEARCH QUESTIONS  While there are typical methodologies and research questions that need to be asked, as  outlined in the steps that follow in this study, a market analysis can be guided by broader  research questions. Taking the IoT market as an example; is the primary reason to analyse the  market because of the well-known cybersecurity incidents or risks for companies to adopt  business models that provide better cybersecurity over the long-term? Or rather, is the primary  reason to analyse the market and understand whether advertised security failures are a barrier  to further uptake? Developing broad research questions will allow us to provide a broader  context to a study being conducted and also determine what resources will be focussed on  when a market analysis is being conducted.  CYBERSECURITY CERTIFICATION MARKET STUDY  April 2021  9  3. PROPOSED WORKFLOW  The following two chapters provide the workflow for how to conduct an assessment of the  Target of Analysis (TOA). While the steps indicated in the diagram below are described as  sequential, it is possible that at a certain moment either the TOA or the scope of a certification  initiative needs to be adjusted. Therefore, there are potential iterations between the steps. The  following diagram provides an overview of the overall workflow in brief, which is further detailed  in Chapter 4.  Figure 1: Workflow for how to conduct an assessment of the Target of Analysis (TOA)  Within this workflow, further described in the following chapter, there will be two main types of  analysis:    Market assessment: A market analysis will be conducted in a market segment where  there is currently no EU cybersecurity certification initiative. This type of market  analysis aims to determine whether there is a justification for EU to consider new  initiatives to be developed, to identify the focus of possible new initiatives or to confirm  the scope of a future initiative.  CYBERSECURITY CERTIFICATION MARKET STUDY  April 2021  10    Impact assessment: A market analysis could support the activities of the EU  cybersecurity certification framework on reviewing the effects of EU cybersecurity  certification. In this case, the scope of the TOA should be easier to determine, because  it will be determined by the effects a scheme has on the market, given its scope that is  the focus of the analysis.  The following Chapter provides a set of methodological steps and a series of questions that  need to be answered at each stage of one of these two types of market analysis. In addition to  the questions to be answered, each step lists the envisioned output that should come from the  analysis as well as the methodologies that could be applied.  CYBERSECURITY CERTIFICATION MARKET STUDY  April 2021  11  4. PROPOSED  METHODOLOGICAL STEPS  4.1 STEP 1: DETERMINE THE CONTEXT AND THE SCOPE OF THE TOA  The goal of this step is to determine the context and the scope of the TOA, by answering the  following questions.   What are the cybersecurity considerations or relevant developments that demand  cybersecurity initiatives on the ‘market’ of the TOA?   What considerations should a cybersecurity certification initiative address?   Who would be affected/involved?  Figure 2: A schematic representation of this step is provided below in addition to the relevant questions.  CYBERSECURITY CERTIFICATION MARKET STUDY  April 2021  12  Q.1 Is there an existing EU cybersecurity certification scheme for the TOA?  - If yes, conduct “impact assessment”  - If no, conduct “market assessment”  Q.2 Does the market analysis relate to a specific sector or application area?  Q.3 How many (potential) producers/manufacturers exist on the market of TOA?  Q.4 Who are the (end) users operating, involved or affected by the TOA?  - Individual consumers/end users  - Suppliers of intermediary input (process, product, service) for the TOA  - Government/public organisations  - Regulatory organisations/bodies  - Private sector organizations  Q.5 Will changes imposed on the market of the TOA have an impact on other markets?  - If yes, which markets other than the TOA markets?  Q.6 How many and which industry verticals does the TOA influence?  Q.7 How many subordinate ICT products, ICT process or ICT services does the TOA  depend upon?  Q.8 Do cybersecurity initiative(s), such as voluntary certification schemes, standards,  technical specifications and/or guidance, exist for the TOA?  - If yes, what is the geographical coverage and acceptance so far?  Q.9 Does the lack of an EU cybersecurity certification scheme for the TOA contribute to  higher direct macroeconomic costs (due to verification and insurance costs, higher rates  of litigation and/or product/service failure)?  Q.10 Does the lack of an EU cybersecurity certification scheme for the TOA contribute to  higher indirect macroeconomic costs (due to inhibited market growth, societal unease  due to uncertainty of application, lack of international coherence, fragmentation of the  cybersecurity market and incoherence between vertical and horizontal markets, etc)?  Consultation of experts via interviews or surveys shall contain the questions listed above.  Different aspects of the TOA, from the composition of the market to the availability of different  cybersecurity initiatives, assessments of the cybersecurity for the TOA, could be retrieved from  existing literature when attempting to answer the questions listed above. This may provide a  more complete overview.  CYBERSECURITY CERTIFICATION MARKET STUDY  April 2021  13  4.2 STEP 2: PRELIMINARY ASSESSMENT OF THE IMPACT OF A  CERTIFICATION INITIATIVE  The goal of this step is to assess preliminary how a cybersecurity initiative impact/will impact the  market of the TOA, by answering the following questions:  Q.11a If “market assessment”, assume you could create a certification initiative for the TOA.  - What should be achieved by acting at EU level?  - Which costs and benefits do you anticipate to have and which stakeholder  groups will be affected?  Q.11b If “impact assessment”, which costs and benefits occurred/were accrued on the market  for the TOA after the launch of a certification initiative?  Table 1 below includes an indicative but not exhaustive range of various costs that are typically  incurred by the stakeholder groups such as businesses, government/public authorities and  citizens.  Table 1: Costs that might be associated with a potential cybersecurity initiative  Cost type Sub-category  Direct costs  Administrative costs  Charges, Fees etc  Other compliance costs  Administration and enforcement  Indirect costs  Costs incurred in related markets or experienced by actors that are not  directly targeted by the certification  Indirect compliance costs  Negative market impacts (such as Reduced market access)  Table 2: Benefits that might be associated with a potential cybersecurity initiative  Benefit type Sub-category Short description  Who potentially  benefits?  Improved market  efficiency  Sub-categories are the  same as the  classification for costs  Improved allocation of  resources, removal of  regulatory or market  failures or cost savings  generated by (new)  certification scheme.  It could also result in  reduced prices for end  users.   The whole  economy  CYBERSECURITY CERTIFICATION MARKET STUDY  April 2021  14  Benefit type Sub-category Short description  Who potentially  benefits?  Increase willingness to  pay for a certified  product  Enhanced reputation of  businesses producing  the certified  product/service/process,  and thus increased trust  of consumers   Businesses  producing/selling  the certified  product/service/pro  cess  Indirect compliance  benefits: Spill-over  effects related to  third party  compliance with a  certification scheme   Businesses in  related markets   Individuals/custome  rs in related  markets  Indirect wider  macroeconomic  benefits  An increase in GDP,  improved  competitiveness;  improved productivity   The whole  economy  Other wider society  benefits  Increased protection of  fundamental rights,  social cohesion,  international stability;  Enhanced cyber security   The whole  economy  After answering the questions on the potential costs and benefits associated with a (potential)  certification initiative, consider the following:  Q.12 What data sources would you need to consult to quantify and identify the financial and  socio-economic costs and benefits?  Data sources and data collection methods could include: usage of secondary sources (desk  research), Interviews and survey, Delphi method5 with either potentially affected stakeholders or  experts in the market of the TOA, consulting subject matter experts, etc.  Q.13 Is it realistic to quantify (in financial and socio-economic values or qualitatively)?  - If yes, continue quantifying.  - If no, go back to step 1, and consider the form that a cybersecurity initiative  might be taking. If the scope of a cybersecurity initiative is quite narrow,  continue quantifying. If it is not realistic to quantify, go back to step 1 and  narrow down/scope the TOA in more detail (this also results in an adjusted  output of step 1).  - Is it realistic to quantify the financial and socio-economic costs and  benefits given the adjusted description and scope of the market of the  TOA?  - If you continue saying no to (c), repeat (b), until you’re able to respond yes  to (c).  5 https://www.rand.org/topics/delphi-method.html  https://www.rand.org/topics/delphi-method.html  CYBERSECURITY CERTIFICATION MARKET STUDY  April 2021  15  Once you analysed the financial and socio-economic costs and benefits, you may consider  checking them by answering the following questions:  • What goals does a cybersecurity initiative attempt to achieve?  • Could alternative solutions be imposed to achieve the goals pursued?  • Are the methods used for the assessment of financial and socio-economic costs and  benefits satisfactory?  • Are any financial and socio-economic costs or benefits omitted?  • Are the methods used providing a reliable evidence?  • Does the assessment of financial and socio-economic costs and benefits allow for  uncertainty in them? Could the change in the assumptions affect the estimated  financial and socio-economic costs and benefits? If yes, how it would affect them and  why?  • If you can make a decision to introduce a new cybersecurity initiative, what would the  recommendation be?  4.3 STEP 3: IDENTIFY AVAILABLE OPTIONS  The goal of this step is to determine options of acting at EU level, by answering the following  questions: What are the various options? At what level (national, EU and international) could they  be taken? What form could various options (regulatory and non-regulatory means) take?  More specifically, the following questions need to be answered:  Q.14a If “market assessment”, determine options or forms of a new scheme:  - Developing a completely new scheme;  - Endorsing an existing one and developing one based on it;  - An option for comparison is also a situation where no new scheme is  created.  Q.14b If “impact assessment”, a comparison point is the counterfactual or a situation that  could have happened in case a certification scheme was not created and not imposed.  Similar to the previous step, a number of questions could be considered for appraising the  calculated costs and benefits of different options:  • Are the identified goals of the cybersecurity initiatives given the financial and socio-  economic costs and benefits possible to achieve?  • Are other options possible looking at the alternative solutions that could be imposed to  achieve the goals pursued?  • Are the methods used for the assessment of financial and socio-economic costs and  benefits effective for the solutions?  • Do the methods used provide a reliable evidence? Does the assessment of financial  and socio-economic costs and benefits allow for uncertainty in them? Could the  change in the assumptions affect the estimated costs and benefits? If yes, how it  would affect them and why?  CYBERSECURITY CERTIFICATION MARKET STUDY  April 2021  16  4.4 STEP 4: COMPARE THE IMPACT OF POSSIBLE OPTIONS  The goal of this step is to compare the differences in impacts of various options, by answering  the following questions  • What are the impacts of the (financial and socio-economic) costs and benefits of  the different policy options?  • What are the differences and who will be affected by them?  • How do the objectives/goals of the different options relate to each other, looking at  their reachability/pursuance at EU level?  • Compare the options and prioritise the level of realistic achievements  • How do the different options compare in total?  Q.15a If “market assessment”, compare the market results of the financial and socio-  economic costs and benefits of the different options.  Q.15b If “impact assessment”, compare the impact of the financial and socio-economic costs  and benefits of the current situation (with an existing certification scheme) to a  counterfactual (situation without a certification scheme)  Q.16 If the differences between financial and socio-economic costs and benefits cannot be  quantified, go back to step 3: determine options for comparison, and redefine the  options to narrow it down; then continue with comparison.  Q.17 If you still cannot quantify the differences between financial and socio-economic costs  and benefits, go back to Step 1 and narrow down the scope of the market; then repeat  Q.13 or Q.14 and Q.11 or 12 until you’re able to quantify the differences in financial and  socio-economic costs and benefits.  4.5 STEP 5: SELECT THE OPTIMAL OPTION  Q.18 Which option is expected to yield the highest net benefits?  Similar to the previous step, a number of questions could be considered for appraising the  calculated (financial and socio-economic) costs and benefits of different options:  • Why does the best option fit the goals in the most optimal way?  • Why are the methods used for the assessment of financial and socio-economic costs  and benefits most satisfactory in terms of reliability and adaption flexibility in  assumptions?  CYBERSECURITY CERTIFICATION MARKET STUDY  April 2021  17  5. CONCLUSIONS AND NEXT  STEPS  One of the main objectives of the EU cybersecurity certification framework is to increase trust  and the cybersecurity reliability of the in ICT products, ICT services and ICT processes and to  address the needs of the EU cybersecurity market. This study aims to provide a set of  methodological steps to identify, gather, analyze and understand these needs. They can relate  to emerging cybersecurity certification needs but also to existing certification schemes under the  CSA. It aims to support an analysis on how schemes are adopted by the market, at defined  moments, and if further adaptations are needed by the involved stakeholders. Analysing the  cybersecurity market is complex due to the number of security vectors or ICT products, ICT  processes and ICT services, as well as the complex nature of supply chains that become larger  due to increasing connectivity and the number of components that may be part of large  systems.  This proposed set of methodological steps attempts to create a structured and step-by-step  approach to identity cybersecurity needs in a complex environment. It aims to provide a  practical guidance to analyse the market, without though creating a textbook on how to conduct  particular types of economic analyses. These proposed steps are divided into four parts and  cover the identification of the context of the market analysis and the scope of the target of  analysis, assessing the impact of a cybersecurity certification initiative, identification of the  available options and possible initiatives. The goal is to be able to identify gaps in the market -  from a cybersecurity certification perspective - without relying solely on input of stakeholders,  but to provide evidence both from the supply and demand sides while factoring societal and  economic aspects.  This first attempt on proposing such a methodology is expected to be further developed after  the publication of the Union Rolling Work Programme by the European Commission. It is  expected that in a more mature state, a market methodology will be able to provide valuable  input for the identification of strategic priorities by the European Commission, the SCCG and the  ECCG, even for future editions of the Union Rolling Work Programme. In addition, it may also  support ENISA in maintaining the EU Cybersecurity Certification Framework, and provide input  for the preparation of future candidate cybersecurity certification schemes, even outside the  Union Rolling Work Programme, upon request of the European Commission or the ECCG.  CYBERSECURITY CERTIFICATION MARKET STUDY  April 2021  18  A ANNEX:  HOW TO ASSESS THE  COSTS AND BENEFITS OF A  CERTIFICATION INITIATIVE  Different methodologies could be used to estimate potential costs and benefits due to a  certification initiative. The choice of a method depends on several factors:  Consideration Description  The scope of a certification  scheme  When different types of costs can be broken down to a relatively  precise set of activities to be carried out, the costs are more easily  estimated adding up the various costs of these activities for a type of  relevant (impacted) stakeholder.  A more qualitative approach could be more suitable in a situation when  a complex certification scheme is considered, where a range of  starting positions across affected (and regulated by the cybersecurity  initiative) entities is wide and/or there are potentially numerous ways in  which stakeholders are impacted.  The expected compliance  costs and the expected  resources to be dedicated  The higher the expected costs (in particular the compliance costs) or  the wider the scope of the certification initiative (or the number of  different options for comparing different certification schemes), the  higher the amount of resources needs to be invested in estimating the  costs and benefits.  The availability of data The greater the availability of data, the more costs and benefits could  be quantitatively estimated.  Assumptions about costs and  benefits  Assumptions might affect the magnitude and size of the impact.  Therefore a check should be performed on how a change in  assumptions affects the costs and benefits.  The costs and benefits can be quantified through estimates based on financial, economic and  statistical data gathered from various sources through:   Determining costs and benefits from secondary sources (desk research)   Interviews   Survey   Delphi method   Modelling.  Annex D presents a table overview of different methods with their advantages, limitations and  potential risks.  A monetary value could be assigned to direct costs and other tangible costs (administrative  costs) and benefits. For other types of costs and benefits it could be difficult to assign a  monetary value. Instead, it could be assessed qualitatively. Most likely, the costs depend on a  specific form that a certification initiative takes, while benefits are most likely to be similar  CYBERSECURITY CERTIFICATION MARKET STUDY  April 2021  19  between different types of initiatives. If it is the case, then only costs of different forms of  initiatives could be assessed and compared.  The costs and benefits are to be compared over time. Therefore a discount rate could be  included in the calculation. In case different options of a cybersecurity certification initiative  concern the same timing, the assumptions about a discount rate are less relevant. On the other  hand, when costs and benefits are incurred at different times, it is necessary to apply such a  rate to compare them on an equivalent basis. The need for assigning a discount rate arises  from the fact that the value of one euro paid today is greater than the value of one euro paid at  some point in the future.  It is possible that a certification initiative might result in some distribution of a welfare between  businesses, consumers, or other players. It is therefore very important to assign which benefits  and costs are relevant for each type of stakeholders on the market of the Target of Analysis  (TOA).  A preliminary assessment of costs and benefits of a potential cybersecurity initiative can provide  a general indication of the scale of the costs and benefits likely to be imposed. A qualitative  assessment could be performed to rank the costs and benefits into low, moderate or high/major  in size. This helps to identify the major cost drivers of a cybersecurity initiative and might result  in reformulation of what the initiative might entail.  When specific data in question is not available, benchmark figures or rules of thumb could be  used. These are for example economy-wide average wage figures, instead of specific estimates  derived from industry of the likely wage costs and benchmark figures for overhead expenses.  Economy-wide averages for the estimation of costs and benefits  Data is available for the EU-27 in Eurostat on a range of indicators such as wage costs and  real added value; however, such averages calculated for the EU-27 most likely do not  reflect the costs in a specific sector that is not defined as part of NACE Rev 2 sectors or  industries.  A.1 NUMBER OF AFFECTED STAKEHOLDERS  Determining the size of the group that would be subject to a proposed cybersecurity initiative is  crucial to developing reliable estimates. The risk of making large errors in estimating these  numbers is often likely to be much greater than the risk of similarly large errors in estimating the  unit costs to individual businesses or regulated parties of complying with particular regulatory  requirements. This means that research on the number of affected parties should generally  receive high priority. When a cybersecurity initiative concerns a specific industry or industries,  potential sources of information on which to base estimates of the number of affected firms  include:   governmental statistical offices, for example, Eurostat;   industry associations;   academic research;   licensing or registration data if available;   information from regulators in other, comparable jurisdictions;   surveys of potentially affected industry sectors (either existing survey-based data or  the results of surveys undertaken as part of the costs and benefits assessment  process).  CYBERSECURITY CERTIFICATION MARKET STUDY  April 2021  20  If an initiative focuses on specific areas rather than affects a wide population, generally  available information from government statistical source is less likely to provide relevant  guidance. Consultation with industry associations or other representative bodies may provide  usable data, particularly where these bodies have a large membership, covering a significant  proportion of the affected group.  Surveys may be expensive and time consuming to conduct both for government and for  stakeholders. Therefore they may not be feasible to perform. However they could be justified if  expected impacts are significant. Small-scale surveys or Delphi method can provide broad  indications of the scale of expected impacts and feedback could be gathered on the magnitude  of the costs and benefits.  A.2 QUANTIFYING THE COSTS  The costs could be direct and indirect. The direct costs are those borne by the businesses  targeted by the cybersecurity initiative and authorities. The indirect costs are less tangible and  could be borne by those not targeted by the cybersecurity initiative.  The direct costs could be one-off or recurring costs. Therefore making a decision on the  frequency of costs will impact the quantification of the costs. It is included in each type of costs  quantification as frequency. The relevant costs parameters could be identified through the table  and the checklist of costs and benefits that could be associated with a certification initiative. In  case some costs are incurred in a situation “business as usual”, then those shall be subtracted  from the costs associated with a certification initiative.  The “business-as-usual” costs are usually assumptions about:   the costs that would not be avoided if a cybersecurity initiative were to be repealed in  case a cybersecurity initiative already exist; or   the costs that are already borne by various parties that will continue to bear these  costs if a new cybersecurity initiative is imposed.  The “business-as-usual” costs are often obtained by consulting targeted stakeholders or  experts. Since these costs are not a result of a newly imposed cybersecurity initiative, it could  be easier to simply mark which costs are “business-as-usual” and which ones are directly  associated with the cybersecurity initiative. In case it is not possible to do so, such costs could  be estimated by looking at the share of costs associated with a substantive obligation that are  borne by similar entities that are not targeted by specific legislative provisions: when this is the  case, you can observe the level of compliance costs for the “regulated” entities and the  “unregulated” ones, and take the difference as the relevant portion of costs to be considered in  your estimate.  All costs might be different over the life of the (proposed) cybersecurity initiative (not considering  the discount factor). If it is the case, such differences need to be accounted in the calculation. In  principle the costs are a multiplication of the amount of time spent on a specific action to comply  with the requirements of a cybersecurity initiative (list of specific actions associated could be  used from Annex B) and the salary costs for the actors performing the actions. The sub-sections  below provide an initial indication of how these costs can be quantified. However, for this initial  phase of the methodology, they are to be considered as relevant material of informational  nature only and not as part of the methodological steps.  CYBERSECURITY CERTIFICATION MARKET STUDY  April 2021  21  A.2.1 Quantifying the direct charges (costs to businesses)  The direct charges quantification  (Regulatory) Charges = Unit cost  × Q  where Unit Cost= the cost of the certification process  where Q (for Quantity) = Number of affected stakeholders x Frequency,  where Frequency is the number of times that the fee for a certification initiative is required to be  paid per year.  Number of affected stakeholders is equal to the number of businesses answered in the question  “Q3: How many (approximately) (potential) producers/manufacturers exist on the market of  TOA?” of “STEP 1: DETERMINE THE CONTEXT AND THE SCOPE OF THE TOA”, in case the  charges are borne by businesses producing/selling the certified product/service/process.  Some (or all) of these charges are zero sums, i.e. a charge for the business and income for the  public authority.  A.2.2 Quantifying the administrative costs6 (costs to businesses)  The administrative costs quantification  Administrative cost for businesses = ∑ 𝑷  × 𝑸  where P (for Price) = Labour cost + Equipment or supplies’ costs; and  where Q (for Quantity) = Number of businesses x Frequency,  Number of businesses is the number of relevant businesses covered under the actual regulation.  The ∑ indicates that the costs need to be summed across different types of costs.  The frequency of required actions that generate administrative costs could be one-off or  recurring at the determined frequency.   Relevant cost parameters.   Labour costs. The parameters to calculate labour costs will be:  o Time spent on a specific action is usually expressed in FTE of involved  organisations to measure the time spent on tasks.  o Salary could be measured in hourly pay or yearly salary of those performing  the action.  o Equipment or supplies’ costs are equipment costs to comply with a  certification scheme, in addition to the equipment costs for general production  processes. Although we expect that a certification scheme does not require  getting new equipment, it might still occur for example that types of equipment  and supplies could be necessary to set-up and run procedures to comply with  a cybersecurity initiative. The cost parameters will be the acquisition price and  the depreciation period.  If the information/actions are actually already part of “business-as-usual” practice, then those  should be subtracted from the costs here.  6  The approach to quantification of the administrative costs for businesses is the so-called Standard Cost Model. The cost  model distinguishes between the administrative costs and administrative burdens. For simplicity, only the term  ‘administrative costs’ is used, which actually refers to administrative burdens. For more information and examples, please  refer to SWD(2017) 350 Better Regulation Guidelines, Tool #60 THE STANDARD COST MODEL FOR ESTIMATING  ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS, available at https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/file_import/better-regulation-toolbox- 60_en_0.pdf.  https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/file_import/better-regulation-toolbox-60_en_0.pdf https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/file_import/better-regulation-toolbox-60_en_0.pdf  CYBERSECURITY CERTIFICATION MARKET STUDY  April 2021  22  If the information is not possible to quantify, it could be assessed qualitatively. For example by  completing the following affirmations with one of the suggested qualitative options: (“very little /  hardly”, “somewhat”, “satisfactorily”, or – “well”) Where “authority”, in the sentences below, we  refer to the authority in charge of administering and enforcing the certification initiative:  1. The data the authority expects me to provide are ___________in line with the data  from my own operating process which I already have available.  2. The way in which I am expected to provide the data to the government is __________  in line with how I have them available  3. I understand ___________ why the government wants to have this information from  me.  4. I understand ____________ why the government asks these details from me at these  intervals.  5. The government ensures __________  that I have to supply my data only once.  6. The amount of data asked by the government is ___________  proportionate to the  purpose.  7. This request for information has been worded in a way that every businessperson /  employee is ____________  able to carry it out.  A.2.3 Quantifying the other compliance costs (costs to businesses)  The other compliance costs quantification  Other compliance Costs = ∑ 𝑷  × 𝑸  where P (for Price) = Labour cost + Equipment or supplies’ costs; and  where Q (for Quantity) = Number of affected businesses x Frequency,  where Frequency is the number of times that the specific type of costs is required to be paid per  year.  The ∑ indicates that the costs need to be summed across different types of costs.  Similarly to the other types of costs, it is a sum of different types of costs, which are calculated  as a multiplication of the labour and equipment costs and number of businesses impacted.  A.2.4 Quantifying the Administration and Enforcement costs (costs to  the authorities in charge of administering the cybersecurity initiative)  Following the same approach as to the direct costs to businesses, the direct costs for authorities  in charge of administering the cybersecurity initiative (usually public authorities) can be  estimated first by defining the activities required to implement and enforce legislation, then  estimating their frequency and their cost (excluding the business-as-usual costs). Potentially  different authorities might be involved, then all the costs need to be calculated and summed.  These costs can vary significantly from option to option and from Member State to Member  State. Moreover, it is important to keep in mind that the costs incurred might differ for different  authorities: while private control organisations, for example, in case of a voluntary initiative, will  charge market fee rates, public authorities might be able to apply some cross-subsidization by  using tax incomes to compensate (a part of) the monitoring and compliance costs.  Annual budget data is usually the source that provides data to distinguish between relevant  administration and enforcement costs. However, it is also possible that the potential costs are  not accounted in the budgets and might require substantial effort in calculating them.  If it is difficult to quantify this type of costs, a qualitative assessment could be performed by  answering the following questions:  CYBERSECURITY CERTIFICATION MARKET STUDY  April 2021  23   Does a (new) certification initiative require the creation of new enforcement mechanisms  or institutions, or would it rely on the existing enforcement mechanisms?   Does the form of the certification initiative have an impact on the size of the costs? If  yes, would they vary significantly between different forms?   Is the expected size of the administration and enforcement costs large that it might mean  that one of the forms of a cybersecurity initiative is preferred?   What kind of costs are driving the size of the administration and enforcement costs? The  checklist of potential costs borne by authorities could be used here to identify such cost  drivers.  A significant risk of double counting the costs arises in relation to this type of costs. Most likely,  these costs will be recovered from regulated businesses or citizens via the direct charges. We  suggest to calculate the full costs for public authorities at this step. Where there is a clear  intention to recover some or all of these costs through the direct charges, calculations of the  expected revenue can also be made and should be included under the business (or citizen) cost  categories as appropriate. However, if this is done, it is important to clarify what is the net cost to  the public sector, as well as the gross cost. By doing so, you distinguish between:   The total cost to authorities for administration and enforcement;   The costs that are expected to be recovered by imposing charges on businesses;   The full cost to businesses of the compliance with a cybersecurity initiative, including the  direct charges.  A.2.5 Quantifying the indirect costs  These costs concern less tangible costs compared to the direct costs and therefore it is usually  not quantifiable. They also have a broader impact on the society. This could entail the impact for  related markets, for actors that are not directly targeted by the cybersecurity initiative or the  society at large.  It is possible (and likely) that the indirect costs are to be the same between different forms of a  cybersecurity initiative. If they are different, these costs need to be assessed qualitatively. If  different forms or options of cybersecurity initiative are considered, they can be assessed as  incremental to each other. In general these questions could be used to assess the indirect  costs:   Does (any of the options of the) cybersecurity initiative create indirect compliance costs?  - This could mean that additional costs are imposed by a certification initiative (or one of  the options of it) that lead for example to restrictions of output, higher downstream prices  or any other additional cost for economic agents other than those targeted by the  cybersecurity initiative;   Does (any of the options of the) cybersecurity initiative lead to substitution effects?  - For example, would citizens or businesses other than the regulated entities shift to  alternative sources of supply? Would citizens or businesses other than the targeted  businesses shift to alternative modes of consumption?   Does (any of the options of the) cybersecurity initiative lead to increased transaction costs?  - For example, would it increase the cost of negotiations between various parties, the  costs of information gathering for users, the costs of looking for a different supplier?  CYBERSECURITY CERTIFICATION MARKET STUDY  April 2021  24   Does (any of the options of the) cybersecurity initiative result in a reduced competition or  market access on the market of the TOA or reduced investment or innovation?  - For example, the following might be considered: the cybersecurity initiative makes it  more difficult for new businesses to enter the market of the TOA or it prevents  businesses from competing aggressively between each other, or businesses collude on  the market of the TOA and therefore it becomes potentially detrimental to end users.  A.3 QUANTIFYING THE BENEFITS  In general, benefits due to a cybersecurity initiative (or any policy initiative) are more difficult to  quantify compared to the costs, since they are less tangible. Nonetheless, some of the  categories of benefits could be quantified. Most likely different options of a cybersecurity  initiative result in very similar benefits with primarily varying costs. If that is the case, the  benefits could be assessed qualitatively. One way to quantify the benefits could be to quantify  those businesses for whom the harm, that a certification initiative aims to solve (in case of  market assessment) or was introduced to solve (in case of impact assessment), would be  reduced if a certification initiative were to be introduced or was introduced.  A.3.1 Quantifying the improved market efficiency  Usually this category of benefits is expressed in cost savings. This could be assessed with the  same steps as the calculation of direct costs, when a certification initiative leads to a reduction  in the direct charges, reduction in compliance costs and/or administration and enforcement  costs (steps 1-4 on quantification of direct costs).  Other type of benefits in this category could be the increased willingness to pay for a certified  (or complying with the cybersecurity initiative) product/service/process. This goes hand in hand  also with stimulating innovation and technological progress, improving information available to  users and other market players. Such non-market benefits are often valued using techniques  which capture the sum of individual preferences, which are themselves modelled using  techniques such as willingness to pay or, alternatively, via simulated experiments observing  what people would actually do in different future situations as opposed to what people think they  will do.  A.3.2 Quantifying the indirect benefits  Indirect benefits concern individuals and business that are not targeted by a certification  initiative and take advantage of positive effects due to business complying with the initiative.  These might be difficult to quantify, therefore the questions below provide guidance on what  kind of information is being targeted:   Does (any of the options of the) cybersecurity initiative lead to indirect compliance benefits (“a  positive externality”)?  - For example, a common standard could be introduced in a certain sector that might  generate important savings for downstream players; legislation that imposed  interoperability between standard interfaces for applications installed on smartphones  might reduce development costs for app developers; etc. these benefits have to be  assessed and, where possible, monetized.   Does (any of the options of the) cybersecurity initiative result in macroeconomic benefits  spreading to other sectors?  - If the expected macroeconomic benefits are expected to be significant for the whole  economy, it could be estimated using partial or general equilibrium models for  quantification of the results. The results then will constitute net benefits (benefits minus  costs). Usually these models rely on a lot of assumptions and require a lot of data for each  CYBERSECURITY CERTIFICATION MARKET STUDY  April 2021  25  sector and on how sectors are linked. They also rely on the publicly available data for the  whole economy and follow NACE Rev.2 sector classifications that do not allow to create  distinction between IoT markets for example. Unless these models are developed  internally, an external party needs to be contracted to perform an analysis requiring this  modelling.   Does (any of the options of the) cybersecurity initiative lead to other non monetizable  benefits? For example, demonstrating compliance to legal obligations or cybersecurity  practises that are considered as best practises.  A.3.3 Single market considerations and Acting at the EU level7  A specific type of benefits can occur when you’re considering acting at EU level. This concerns  options or initiatives that have an impact of the Single Market, particularly when the initiatives  lead to the harmonisation of national frameworks (legislation). Therefore benefits could arise  when national framework is fragmented and inconsistent, and action at EU level is taken to  harmonise it. Therefore businesses that would like to trade cross-border, would not have costs  such as:   Compliance with national frameworks;   Adjustments of standards or personnel to deal with national requirements;   Additional administrative costs to provide other information (for example, additional  paperwork).  Once those companies enter cross-border markets, they can benefit from economies of scale,  leading to a stronger competition on those markets.  While there could be clear benefits for such type of companies, the harmonisation might result  in significant adaptations and changes for certain Member States. For example, when there is  an existing certification scheme in France and a completely different certification scheme is  introduced at the EU level, it would mean that the national framework in France has to  completely change and adjust to the new EU certification scheme.  The quantification of the impacts of such a policy could be rather abstract, therefore seeking  external advice is suggested. Specific questions that could guide identification of such an  impact could be:   Is the regulatory framework on cybersecurity harmonized?   Do businesses and end users face different cybersecurity requirements in each Member  State?   Are certain requirement more cumbersome for foreign companies?   If a certification initiative is imposed at the EU level, will it lead to increase or decrease in  choice for end users? Will there be more competition? Will it lead to improvement of the  cybersecurity performance for the whole EU?  7 Further guidance could be found in SWD(2017) 350 Better Regulation Guidelines, Tool #21 IMPACTS ON THE  INTERNAL MARKET, available at https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/file_import/better-regulation-toolbox-60_en_0.pdf.  https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/file_import/better-regulation-toolbox-60_en_0.pdf  CYBERSECURITY CERTIFICATION MARKET STUDY  April 2021  26  B ANNEX:  CHECKLIST OF POTENTIAL  ACTIVITIES PER TYPE OF  COST OF A CERTIFICATION  INITIATIVE  The following checklist includes a wide range of costs that are typically incurred by business,  public authorities and citizens respectively:  Type of costs Example of a cost  Costs borne by Businesses  Administrative costs Reporting/giving notice to the authority in charge of enforcement  Administrative costs Familiarising oneself with the regulatory requirements  Administrative costs Assessing options (including benefit/cost assessment)  Administrative costs Choosing an option and developing a compliance strategy  Administrative costs Applying for a certification  Administrative costs Time spent on cooperation with authority in charge of granting/enforcing obligations  Administrative costs Information provision (e.g. for disclosure based regulation)  Charges  Fees, levies, taxes, cost of a certification (some or all of these charges are zero sums, i.e. a  charge for the businesses and income for the public authority)  Other compliance costs Procuring equipment if required  Other compliance costs Staff recruitment and/or training  Other compliance costs Purchase of external services  Other compliance costs Changing production, warehousing and/or distribution processes  Administrative costs Monitoring/audit of compliance and review of compliance performance  Other compliance costs Design and implementation of any needed changes to the compliance strategy.

Method Application Advantages Limitations and risks  Survey  The questionnaire for  the survey could  contain information on  direct labour costs  (wage or salary costs),  overhead costs,  material costs or any  other type of costs and  benefits that could be  foreseen. The  averages could be  calculated for any type  of sector or industry in  question.   Depending on the response rate  and representativeness of the  results, questionnaires can be  used for generalisation or  approximation to larger  population beyond the sample or  a population of stakeholders in a  similar sector or industry.   Questionnaires make it possible  to gather a large amount of data  in a relatively short period of time  and with relatively limited costs.   Online questionnaires can incite  high rates of participants, as they  are often seen as not taking up  too much time.   A survey can be quite time consuming  for the surveyed stakeholders or  require gathering information that they  don’t have at hand.   It may be difficult to obtain a good  response rate from the relevant  stakeholder group. Often respondents  lack motivation to respond.  Respondents might therefore not  reply and the researcher risks a low  response rate, potentially impacting  the representativeness of the sample.   If the questionnaire is not well  designed and sufficiently clear there  is a risk for misinterpretation of  questions and options by the  respondents with the consequential  risk of lack of consistency between  responses.  Interviews  The questionnaire  could contain the same  information as in a  survey questionnaire;  however, most likely  only qualitative  information could be  gathered.   Interviews can combine structure  with flexibility. Especially in  comparison to surveys,  interviews offer the opportunity to  obtain clarifications of incomplete  and ambiguous answers.   Information is generated in an  interactive manner between the  researcher and the interviewee,  which makes the interview  dynamic in nature.   The researcher uses a range of  probes and techniques to actively  achieve depth of answer in terms  of penetration, exploration and  explanation.   Interviews with open-ended questions  produce less statistically valuable  data and may not be the right tool for  obtaining representative results. They  are hence not the ideal tool to collect  quantitative data from stakeholders.   Information collected through different  interviews, especially less structured  ones, might not be comparable and  can be hard to aggregate.   Interviews are a time-consuming tool  in terms of resources needed to set  practical arrangements, particularly if  conducted individually.   The interviewer needs a thorough  understanding of the topic close to  the level of the interviewee, to be able  to identify the most relevant and  precise questions, and to know when  to ask follow-up questions. When  working on a new subject, gaining  deep knowledge on the topic before  engaging in interviews can be  challenging.  CYBERSECURITY CERTIFICATION MARKET STUDY  April 2021  30  Method Application Advantages Limitations and risks  Delphi  method8  The Delphi method  could be applied to  gather information on  costs and benefits  when such information  does not exist or is  very hard to find or the  sources of it are  questionable. A  questionnaire could be  drafted for a number of  geographically spread  experts in certain fields  (like sector experts) to  gather such  information. The  collective decision is  drawn on the basis of  a number of iterations.   Even though experts might be  aware that they participate in a  Delphi method together,  anonymity of answers ensures  that none of experts is influenced  by somebody else’s opinion.   This method offers a great  possibility to gather data when  statistical sources, academic and  grey literature do not provide  needed information or when  there is no agreement among  experts.   It could be an alternative to  studies and reports that require  payments. Though it could be  weighted.   It could be time consuming to gather  information from the experts and feed  it back to the whole group.   Continued commitment is required  from the experts who answer the  questions through multiple iterations.   The reliability of results or answers of  experts could be questioned, as there  is most likely no evidence for the  views that experts express.  Assessment  of a  willingness  to pay  through  stated and  revealed  preferences9  This method allows to  assess the impact on  citizens and  consumers through  analysis of behaviour  or by asking users on  their preferences  regarding certain  changes in the  regulatory  environment.   This approach relies on the  design of questionnaires, and  conducting surveys, therefore the  advantages are similar to the  ones described above for the  survey.   These methods could be rather  theoretical and time consuming.   Organising a setting where  consumers indicated what they would  do hypothetically might not yield the  results that could actually happen in  practice, therefore the construction of  a questionnaire is very important.  Determining  costs and  benefits  from  secondary  sources  Methods described  above could be difficult  to implement because  of time or resource  constraints. Therefore  the impacts estimated  as part of another  research, report or  study could be used as  a proxy.   Low cost approach for obtaining  quantitative and qualitative  information.   It could be robust when multiple  sources are used.   It should be treated with caution and  properly justified. It requires  documenting assumptions and  perhaps might require further  adjustments.  Modelling,  for example  computable  general  equilibrium  models  Modelling could be  used to predict the  amount of net benefits  (benefits minus costs)  generated by a certain  regulatory intervention.   Models are designed to analyse  how changes in one industry,  market or region lead to a  reallocation of resources among  several dimensions like sectors  and countries.   The models are particularly  helpful when expected spill over  effects are significant.   It relies on pre-existing data that  are available from most national  statistical offices.   This could be very resource and time  intensive. It relies on models, which if  not developed in-house, require  contracting external experts to run the  models.   The models rely on a number of  assumptions and are very data  intensive.  8 https://research.phoenix.edu/content/research-methodology-group/delphi-method  9 Revealed preferences method refers to observing what consumers would pay to achieve a certain outcome; while stated  preferences assessment refers to asking consumers directly how much they would be willing to pay to achieve a certain  outcome in the future.

For more traditional and stable markets, data sources such as  Eurostat, the OECD, or the various national statistics offices can provide a solid basis upon  which to understand the overall size of a market in terms of turnover, employment, and other  relevant factors. But the purpose of these public data sets is to understand macro-level  developments in the economy, and public data sets also tend to defer to collecting information  over relatively long timeframes. This can lead to data being collected and collated into  categories that do not have much use in a fluid market.  As an example, the European Commission, through the statistical body of Eurostat, classifies a  lot of the data that it collects along the Statistical Classification of Economic Activities in the  European Community / Nomenclature Générale des Activités Économiques dans les  Communautés Européennes10, commonly referred to as NACE, a scheme that has not been  revised since 2006. Many ICT activities are categorised under category J, which is “information  and communication”. Categories here are quite large and fail to capture any nuance in the  market. Just a few examples of categories in the scheme include:  J58.2 - Software publishing  J58.2.1 - Publishing of computer games  J58.2.9 - Other software publishing  J61 - Telecommunications  J61.1 - Wired telecommunications activities  J61.1.0 - Wired telecommunications activities  J61.2 - Wireless telecommunications activities  J61.2.0 - Wireless telecommunications activities  J62 - Computer programming, consultancy and related activities  J62.0 - Computer programming, consultancy and related activities  J62.0.1 - Computer programming activities  J62.0.2 - Computer consultancy activities  J62.0.3 - Computer facilities management activities  J62.0.9 - Other information technology and computer service activities  J63 - Information service activities  J63.1 - Data processing, hosting and related activities; web portals  J63.1.1 - Data processing, hosting and related activities  J63.1.2 - Web portals  With this critique offered, there are some public data sets that provide unique and specific data  for particular markets.

While some higher level studies managed to use public data sources to conduct their analysis,  the more relevant and specific articles that were categorised as a part of the analysis either  used their own data sets  - not all of which were of clear quality or gathered in a  methodologically transparent way - or were based on survey data. The latter category seemed  to be the most consistent way that market analyses in this field collected data, drawing often on  proprietary surveys.  Another familiar means to collect data was via national associations and cybersecurity  authorities, which is a common way to get access to data. One challenge of this source of data,  particularly from associations, is that the data they share will tend to support a particular  viewpoint and access to this data can often depend on whether the association feels that a  report will fall within their interests. It may also be selective and can also lack transparency,  which introduces questions of bias (how many companies were surveyed, what size, what  geographical spread and many other questions).  Finally, there are private data sets that are collected by well-established firms, which are sold to  governments and consultancies for analysis. Private-sector datasets tend to provide the  greatest level of specificity, given that other private companies use them to make business  decisions, but they also create challenges for market analyses that are used in a public sector  setting, namely:    The costs for accessing private-sector datasets can be quite high.    Private-sector datasets can come with Intellectual Property Right (IPR) restrictions,  meaning that certain details cannot be published, which may not be feasible in a  public-sector context where the results of a market analysis need to be shared with  stakeholders and even the general public.    Working with private-sector datasets works better in cases where the market analysis  is a one-time exercise. In some cases, it can be useful to conduct the same analysis  several times to understand how the market is evolving, and this comparison works  best if the methodology can be replicated across studies. This means that the same  datasets should be used, which means continually purchasing datasets from the same  vendors. This creates vendor lock-in, and the potential for vendors to exploit their  position for financial advantage.

From an  economic perspective, these evaluations might subsequently also address imbalances in the  market that could lead to suboptimal outcomes. Cybersecurity certification also touches upon  socio-economic aspects such as user trust and market responsibility of the owner of the  certificate. Further to that it also touches upon the need to provide a reasonable level of  cybersecurity for a ‘duty of care’ throughout the ICT product, ICT service or ICT process  lifecycle and the prevention of costs of a cybersecurity failure and subsequent loss of market  reputation. Therefore, the drivers for cybersecurity certification in the EU go beyond  cybersecurity requirements.  This study proposes a set of initial methodological steps to work towards a market  analysis on cybersecurity certification of ICT products, ICT services and ICT processes.  The performance of a market analysis on cybersecurity certification aims to contribute to  the EU cybersecurity certification framework and the planning activities of the European  Commission, the ECCG and the SCCG by identifying future areas for cybersecurity  certification.  The proposed steps described in this study are divided into four main sections and cover:  i) the identification of the context of the market analysis,  ii) the scope of the target of analysis,  iii) assessing the impact of a cybersecurity certification initiative and  iv) the identification of the available options and possible initiatives.  The goal is to be able to identify certification needs or ‘gaps’ in the market without relying solely  on input of stakeholders, but rather to provide evidence both from the supply and demand sides  while factoring societal and economic aspects.  This first attempt on proposing such a methodology is expected to evolve and to be further  developed and improved after the publication of the Union Rolling Work Programme by the  European Commission. It is expected that a more mature market analysis methodology will be  able to generate information that feeds the identification of the strategic priorities set by the  European Commission, the ECCG and the SCCG. The methodology also aims to provide  valuable input to the preparations of candidate cybersecurity certification schemes.

INTRODUCTION  The EU cybersecurity certification framework, established under the Cybersecurity Act (CSA)1,  is an instrument that aims to establish and maintain trust and security in Information and  Communications Technology (ICT) products, ICT services and ICT processes. Drawing up  cybersecurity certification schemes at EU level aims at providing harmonised criteria to carry out  conformity assessments to establish the degree of adherence of the products, services and  processes against specific predefined requirements. The Union Rolling Work Programme  (URWP) is a strategic document that allows industry stakeholders, Member States and  standardisation bodies to get a clear view on future EU cybersecurity certification schemes. It is  a multiannual overview of future candidate schemes and provides a midterm overview of the  defined future fields of certification, which the European Commission intends to submit to  ENISA. The URWP is drafted in close collaboration with the European Cybersecurity  Certification Group (the ‘ECCG’) and the Stakeholders Cybersecurity Certification Group (the  ‘SCCG’).  EU cybersecurity certification schemes will primarily address the level of cybersecurity required  for ICT products, ICT services or ICT processes. From an economic perspective, they could  address imbalances in the market that lead to suboptimal outcomes and could also touch upon  socio-economic aspects such as user trust, the duty of care of a manufacturer or provider and  prevention of cybersecurity failure to protect market reputation. Therefore, the drivers for  cybersecurity certification in the EU go beyond cybersecurity requirements. This broader  understanding and oversight would be beneficial to the policy and regulatory certification  activities of the European Commission.  Towards this direction, ENISA, conducted as part of its Annual Programming document 2020  (under Output O.5.1.2) a study on identifying a set of methodological steps to allow for a market  analysis on cybersecurity certification of ICT products, ICT services and ICT processes. While  preparing these steps, the following considerations were taken into account:  1. How to segment the cybersecurity market and what is the “Target of Analysis”:  Analysing the cybersecurity market is complicated looking at the number of security  vectors for ICT products, ICT processes and ICT services as well as the complex  nature of the supply chains and complex systems with a lot of ICT components. For  example, Connected and Automated Mobility (CAM) have numerous security vectors:  technical, processes, and principles. At the same time, they include complex structures  of components and create a multipart supply chain. Within this supply chain there are  also segments of analysis including sensors, smart devices/ Internet of Things (IoT)  devices, cloud computing, Industrial Automated Control Systems (IACS) and other  areas. Disentangling these levels for analysis is a crucial first step to conduct a market  analysis. Lastly, introducing cybersecurity solutions in one area may have knock-on  effects in other sectors of the economy, which also need to be taken into account.  2. How does the reasoning of the request influence the market analysis: There are  two basic reasons to conduct a market analysis: i) to determine whether an  cybersecurity certification based intervention is required, especially in an emerging  market or ii) to determine the performance of a new security scheme and whether it is  improving market performance. If the analysis is being conducted to understand  1 Regulation (EU) 2019/881 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17 April 2019 on ENISA (the European Union  Agency for Cybersecurity) and on information and communications technology cybersecurity certification and repealing  Regulation (EU) No 526/2013 (Cybersecurity Act) http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg/2019/881/oj  EU cybersecurity  certification  schemes are  expected to  touch upon  socio-economic  aspects such as  user trust.  http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg/2019/881/oj  CYBERSECURITY CERTIFICATION MARKET STUDY  April 2021  5  market performance, the methodology addresses issues related to cybersecurity  requirements, trust building or how it could help to address societal challenges.  1.1 SCOPE - OBJECTIVES  The objective of this study is to propose a set of methodological steps to allow for a market  analysis on cybersecurity certification of ICT products, ICT services and ICT processes. It  attempts to strike a balance, providing a list of steps and potential questions that can be asked  without creating a textbook on how to conduct particular types of economic analyses. It provides  a methodological toolbox that can be applied to the cybersecurity market. This toolbox includes  caveats about the use and limitations of individual tools, their combinations, what types of  conclusions can be reached with their help and what needs to be considered when interpreting  the results. Further to that, it incorporates potential costs (e.g. man/days and cost of data  purchase) associated with the use of the toolbox, whether there are interdependencies with  other activities and/or stakeholders and what quality assurance measures will be necessary to  produce better results.  1.2 STRUCTURE OF THE DOCUMENT  Chapter 2 of the study provides further context on the questions to ask before conducting a  market analysis, including understanding how to best scope the market of interest and how to  develop specific research questions that the market analysis is looking to answer. Chapters 3  and 4 provide step-by-step approach that can be used to guide a market analysis, providing a  set of indicative questions that could be used. Lastly, Chapter 5 concludes the study and  provides indications of how it could support the activities of the European Commission, ENISA,  ECCG and the ECCG. At the end of this report, a set of annexes provide indicative guidance for  specific aspects of market elements.  CYBERSECURITY CERTIFICATION MARKET STUDY  April 2021  6  2. CONSIDERATIONS PRIOR  TO THE ANALYSIS  2.1 SCOPING AND SEGMENTATIONS OF THE CYBERSECURITY  MARKET  Market segmentation is usually used to assess individual parts of a specific market2, providing  scope and boundaries to any analysis of relevant trends, evolution and performance. These  boundaries will be vital, depending on the scope of each analysis, because without clear  borders, a market analysis can quickly devolve into a massive exercise that touches on more  cybersecurity aspects than those really needed in the economy. For example, if an analysis  aims to cover Connected and Automated Mobility (CAM)3, it potentially includes4:   Connected services and off-board systems that are characterised by agile  development cycles involving the continuous evolution of services following staggered  releases; a large number of short-term projects generally based on scalable and  modular cloud architectures.   Various physical infrastructures, equipment, products and associated services,  vehicles and soft-mobility devices based on Operational Technology (OT),  electrics/electronics (E/E) architectures which must meet the security and technical  requirements associated with various types of quality validations or regulatory  approvals (e.g. vehicle type approval).   Wireless networks, including automated guided vehicles (AVGs) and human  interface systems (HMI) as equipment. Products and associated services are  connected by, for example, Bluetooth, Wi-FI/WLAN or other wireless techniques.  Such a scoping exercise is particularly necessary as policy-makers tend to have broader socio-  economic interests compared to a market analysis designed for private-sector entities, where  questions around the market are narrower in focus. A market analysis within the context of  cybersecurity initiatives needs to take into account the interests of (end) users, stakeholders,  employees, policymakers, and national authorities as well. Segmentation can take place along a  number of different aspects which include among others:   type of ICT product, ICT service or ICT process;   application area;   sector;   stakeholders involved and/or concerned;   technologies used and or deployed;   geographical boundaries of the market.  The final selection of the segmentation—the target of analysis—will depend largely on the  research questions that the activity is looking to answer. Criteria by which the target can be  scoped are determined by a number of factors, including:  2 Dolnicar S., Grün B., Leisch F. (2018) Market Segmentation Analysis. In: Market Segmentation Analysis. Management for  Professionals. Springer, Singapore. https://doi.org/10.1007/978-981-10-8818-6_2  3 Connected and automated mobility in Europe. European Commission.

The market needs that the analysis wishes to (potentially) address. This first  criterion can be a “chicken and egg” situation. One of the reasons to conduct a market  analysis is to understand areas where a market is not functioning in an optimal way. At  the same time, a market will generally only become of interest when stakeholders are  raising particular issues, or when innovative developments in technology seem  promising, which generally means that there is at least some starting point for why the  analysis is being conducted.  2. The data available for the study. Available data on market size, market shares, value  chains, revenues, market consumers and other relevant elements will be key to  providing the quantitative basis for a market analysis, and the more datasets that are  available, the easier an analysis becomes. As discussed in the following chapters,  datasets in high-tech -particularly for new technologies - can be quite difficult to reveal  or find (or may be of dubious quality).  Ideally, the source of information on how to segment a market and determine the final target of  analysis should come from available expert market knowledge, but for ‘undefined’ markets, this  may not be at hand. Under these circumstances, it will be necessary to seek out views from  various stakeholders. Stakeholders that may be consulted to help determine the scope are  indicatively listed below:   Industry experts from business associations: Business associations will have direct  links to the companies affected by cybersecurity issues, and they will have a broad  access to useful insights. Being associations they will also be able to provide an  overview of issues across a sector.   Industry experts from business consultants: Industry experts and business  consultants will come from multiple perspectives. They will tend to have a broad  overview of a sector, and they may also have more insight into the operational  elements.   Private Sector company experts: Companies will be able to provide direct  information on the costs to their business and will already have a good understanding  and prior experience with market analyses.   Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and start-ups: Getting direct access  to SMEs is an ideal data source as they will have the same insights into business  operations as larger operations, but will have experience on how to better access a  specific market and how to meet its needs. Start-ups often have a good view on new  markets to explore and are able to provide trendsetting information.   Consumers and consumer associations: Consumers can provide the requirements  and needs from the end user perspective and highlight the societal and possible  acceptance aspects and their needs.   Regulators and policymakers: Regulators and policymakers, particularly those  responsible for regulating a specific sector or policy area, will have insights into both  how the sector works, as well as in relation to other sectors and look into the broader  socio-economic impacts - both positive and negative - of activities within a particular  sector.   Researchers and academia: Academics will have a broad overview of the sector from  numerous perspectives. They are the most likely to provide research information on  possible market developments, or opportunities or information related to the  effectiveness of (new) analysis methods. They may answer questions in an  unprejudiced manner and can also highlight recent research results.  CYBERSECURITY CERTIFICATION MARKET STUDY  April 2021  8  2.2 DEVELOPING RESEARCH QUESTIONS  While there are typical methodologies and research questions that need to be asked, as  outlined in the steps that follow in this study, a market analysis can be guided by broader  research questions. Taking the IoT market as an example; is the primary reason to analyse the  market because of the well-known cybersecurity incidents or risks for companies to adopt  business models that provide better cybersecurity over the long-term? Or rather, is the primary  reason to analyse the market and understand whether advertised security failures are a barrier  to further uptake? Developing broad research questions will allow us to provide a broader  context to a study being conducted and also determine what resources will be focussed on  when a market analysis is being conducted.  CYBERSECURITY CERTIFICATION MARKET STUDY  April 2021  9  3. PROPOSED WORKFLOW  The following two chapters provide the workflow for how to conduct an assessment of the  Target of Analysis (TOA). While the steps indicated in the diagram below are described as  sequential, it is possible that at a certain moment either the TOA or the scope of a certification  initiative needs to be adjusted. Therefore, there are potential iterations between the steps. The  following diagram provides an overview of the overall workflow in brief, which is further detailed  in Chapter 4.  Figure 1: Workflow for how to conduct an assessment of the Target of Analysis (TOA)  Within this workflow, further described in the following chapter, there will be two main types of  analysis:    Market assessment: A market analysis will be conducted in a market segment where  there is currently no EU cybersecurity certification initiative. This type of market  analysis aims to determine whether there is a justification for EU to consider new  initiatives to be developed, to identify the focus of possible new initiatives or to confirm  the scope of a future initiative.  CYBERSECURITY CERTIFICATION MARKET STUDY  April 2021  10    Impact assessment: A market analysis could support the activities of the EU  cybersecurity certification framework on reviewing the effects of EU cybersecurity  certification. In this case, the scope of the TOA should be easier to determine, because  it will be determined by the effects a scheme has on the market, given its scope that is  the focus of the analysis.  The following Chapter provides a set of methodological steps and a series of questions that  need to be answered at each stage of one of these two types of market analysis. In addition to  the questions to be answered, each step lists the envisioned output that should come from the  analysis as well as the methodologies that could be applied.  CYBERSECURITY CERTIFICATION MARKET STUDY  April 2021  11  4. PROPOSED  METHODOLOGICAL STEPS  4.1 STEP 1: DETERMINE THE CONTEXT AND THE SCOPE OF THE TOA  The goal of this step is to determine the context and the scope of the TOA, by answering the  following questions.   What are the cybersecurity considerations or relevant developments that demand  cybersecurity initiatives on the ‘market’ of the TOA?   What considerations should a cybersecurity certification initiative address?   Who would be affected/involved?  Figure 2: A schematic representation of this step is provided below in addition to the relevant questions.  CYBERSECURITY CERTIFICATION MARKET STUDY  April 2021  12  Q.1 Is there an existing EU cybersecurity certification scheme for the TOA?  - If yes, conduct “impact assessment”  - If no, conduct “market assessment”  Q.2 Does the market analysis relate to a specific sector or application area?  Q.3 How many (potential) producers/manufacturers exist on the market of TOA?  Q.4 Who are the (end) users operating, involved or affected by the TOA?  - Individual consumers/end users  - Suppliers of intermediary input (process, product, service) for the TOA  - Government/public organisations  - Regulatory organisations/bodies  - Private sector organizations  Q.5 Will changes imposed on the market of the TOA have an impact on other markets?  - If yes, which markets other than the TOA markets?  Q.6 How many and which industry verticals does the TOA influence?  Q.7 How many subordinate ICT products, ICT process or ICT services does the TOA  depend upon?  Q.8 Do cybersecurity initiative(s), such as voluntary certification schemes, standards,  technical specifications and/or guidance, exist for the TOA?  - If yes, what is the geographical coverage and acceptance so far?  Q.9 Does the lack of an EU cybersecurity certification scheme for the TOA contribute to  higher direct macroeconomic costs (due to verification and insurance costs, higher rates  of litigation and/or product/service failure)?  Q.10 Does the lack of an EU cybersecurity certification scheme for the TOA contribute to  higher indirect macroeconomic costs (due to inhibited market growth, societal unease  due to uncertainty of application, lack of international coherence, fragmentation of the  cybersecurity market and incoherence between vertical and horizontal markets, etc)?  Consultation of experts via interviews or surveys shall contain the questions listed above.  Different aspects of the TOA, from the composition of the market to the availability of different  cybersecurity initiatives, assessments of the cybersecurity for the TOA, could be retrieved from  existing literature when attempting to answer the questions listed above. This may provide a  more complete overview.  CYBERSECURITY CERTIFICATION MARKET STUDY  April 2021  13  4.2 STEP 2: PRELIMINARY ASSESSMENT OF THE IMPACT OF A  CERTIFICATION INITIATIVE  The goal of this step is to assess preliminary how a cybersecurity initiative impact/will impact the  market of the TOA, by answering the following questions:  Q.11a If “market assessment”, assume you could create a certification initiative for the TOA.  - What should be achieved by acting at EU level?  - Which costs and benefits do you anticipate to have and which stakeholder  groups will be affected?  Q.11b If “impact assessment”, which costs and benefits occurred/were accrued on the market  for the TOA after the launch of a certification initiative?  Table 1 below includes an indicative but not exhaustive range of various costs that are typically  incurred by the stakeholder groups such as businesses, government/public authorities and  citizens.  Table 1: Costs that might be associated with a potential cybersecurity initiative  Cost type Sub-category  Direct costs  Administrative costs  Charges, Fees etc  Other compliance costs  Administration and enforcement  Indirect costs  Costs incurred in related markets or experienced by actors that are not  directly targeted by the certification  Indirect compliance costs  Negative market impacts (such as Reduced market access)  Table 2: Benefits that might be associated with a potential cybersecurity initiative  Benefit type Sub-category Short description  Who potentially  benefits?  Improved market  efficiency  Sub-categories are the  same as the  classification for costs  Improved allocation of  resources, removal of  regulatory or market  failures or cost savings  generated by (new)  certification scheme.  It could also result in  reduced prices for end  users.   The whole  economy  CYBERSECURITY CERTIFICATION MARKET STUDY  April 2021  14  Benefit type Sub-category Short description  Who potentially  benefits?

Data sources and data collection methods could include: usage of secondary sources (desk  research), Interviews and survey, Delphi method5 with either potentially affected stakeholders or  experts in the market of the TOA, consulting subject matter experts, etc.  Q.13 Is it realistic to quantify (in financial and socio-economic values or qualitatively)?  - If yes, continue quantifying.  - If no, go back to step 1, and consider the form that a cybersecurity initiative  might be taking. If the scope of a cybersecurity initiative is quite narrow,  continue quantifying. If it is not realistic to quantify, go back to step 1 and  narrow down/scope the TOA in more detail (this also results in an adjusted  output of step 1).  - Is it realistic to quantify the financial and socio-economic costs and  benefits given the adjusted description and scope of the market of the  TOA?  - If you continue saying no to (c), repeat (b), until you’re able to respond yes  to (c).  5 https://www.rand.org/topics/delphi-method.html  https://www.rand.org/topics/delphi-method.html  CYBERSECURITY CERTIFICATION MARKET STUDY  April 2021  15  Once you analysed the financial and socio-economic costs and benefits, you may consider  checking them by answering the following questions:  • What goals does a cybersecurity initiative attempt to achieve?  • Could alternative solutions be imposed to achieve the goals pursued?  • Are the methods used for the assessment of financial and socio-economic costs and  benefits satisfactory?  • Are any financial and socio-economic costs or benefits omitted?  • Are the methods used providing a reliable evidence?  • Does the assessment of financial and socio-economic costs and benefits allow for  uncertainty in them? Could the change in the assumptions affect the estimated  financial and socio-economic costs and benefits? If yes, how it would affect them and  why?  • If you can make a decision to introduce a new cybersecurity initiative, what would the  recommendation be?  4.3 STEP 3: IDENTIFY AVAILABLE OPTIONS  The goal of this step is to determine options of acting at EU level, by answering the following  questions: What are the various options? At what level (national, EU and international) could they  be taken? What form could various options (regulatory and non-regulatory means) take?  More specifically, the following questions need to be answered:  Q.14a If “market assessment”, determine options or forms of a new scheme:  - Developing a completely new scheme;  - Endorsing an existing one and developing one based on it;  - An option for comparison is also a situation where no new scheme is  created.  Q.14b If “impact assessment”, a comparison point is the counterfactual or a situation that  could have happened in case a certification scheme was not created and not imposed.  Similar to the previous step, a number of questions could be considered for appraising the  calculated costs and benefits of different options:  • Are the identified goals of the cybersecurity initiatives given the financial and socio-  economic costs and benefits possible to achieve?  • Are other options possible looking at the alternative solutions that could be imposed to  achieve the goals pursued?  • Are the methods used for the assessment of financial and socio-economic costs and  benefits effective for the solutions?  • Do the methods used provide a reliable evidence? Does the assessment of financial  and socio-economic costs and benefits allow for uncertainty in them? Could the  change in the assumptions affect the estimated costs and benefits? If yes, how it  would affect them and why?  CYBERSECURITY CERTIFICATION MARKET STUDY  April 2021  16  4.4 STEP 4: COMPARE THE IMPACT OF POSSIBLE OPTIONS  The goal of this step is to compare the differences in impacts of various options, by answering  the following questions  • What are the impacts of the (financial and socio-economic) costs and benefits of  the different policy options?  • What are the differences and who will be affected by them?  • How do the objectives/goals of the different options relate to each other, looking at  their reachability/pursuance at EU level?  • Compare the options and prioritise the level of realistic achievements  • How do the different options compare in total?  Q.15a If “market assessment”, compare the market results of the financial and socio-  economic costs and benefits of the different options.  Q.15b If “impact assessment”, compare the impact of the financial and socio-economic costs  and benefits of the current situation (with an existing certification scheme) to a  counterfactual (situation without a certification scheme)  Q.16 If the differences between financial and socio-economic costs and benefits cannot be  quantified, go back to step 3: determine options for comparison, and redefine the  options to narrow it down; then continue with comparison.  Q.17 If you still cannot quantify the differences between financial and socio-economic costs  and benefits, go back to Step 1 and narrow down the scope of the market; then repeat  Q.13 or Q.14 and Q.11 or 12 until you’re able to quantify the differences in financial and  socio-economic costs and benefits.  4.5 STEP 5: SELECT THE OPTIMAL OPTION  Q.18 Which option is expected to yield the highest net benefits?  Similar to the previous step, a number of questions could be considered for appraising the  calculated (financial and socio-economic) costs and benefits of different options:  • Why does the best option fit the goals in the most optimal way?  • Why are the methods used for the assessment of financial and socio-economic costs  and benefits most satisfactory in terms of reliability and adaption flexibility in  assumptions?

CONCLUSIONS AND NEXT  STEPS  One of the main objectives of the EU cybersecurity certification framework is to increase trust  and the cybersecurity reliability of the in ICT products, ICT services and ICT processes and to  address the needs of the EU cybersecurity market. This study aims to provide a set of  methodological steps to identify, gather, analyze and understand these needs. They can relate  to emerging cybersecurity certification needs but also to existing certification schemes under the  CSA. It aims to support an analysis on how schemes are adopted by the market, at defined  moments, and if further adaptations are needed by the involved stakeholders. Analysing the  cybersecurity market is complex due to the number of security vectors or ICT products, ICT  processes and ICT services, as well as the complex nature of supply chains that become larger  due to increasing connectivity and the number of components that may be part of large  systems.  This proposed set of methodological steps attempts to create a structured and step-by-step  approach to identity cybersecurity needs in a complex environment. It aims to provide a  practical guidance to analyse the market, without though creating a textbook on how to conduct  particular types of economic analyses. These proposed steps are divided into four parts and  cover the identification of the context of the market analysis and the scope of the target of  analysis, assessing the impact of a cybersecurity certification initiative, identification of the  available options and possible initiatives. The goal is to be able to identify gaps in the market -  from a cybersecurity certification perspective - without relying solely on input of stakeholders,  but to provide evidence both from the supply and demand sides while factoring societal and  economic aspects.  This first attempt on proposing such a methodology is expected to be further developed after  the publication of the Union Rolling Work Programme by the European Commission. It is  expected that in a more mature state, a market methodology will be able to provide valuable  input for the identification of strategic priorities by the European Commission, the SCCG and the  ECCG, even for future editions of the Union Rolling Work Programme. In addition, it may also  support ENISA in maintaining the EU Cybersecurity Certification Framework, and provide input  for the preparation of future candidate cybersecurity certification schemes, even outside the  Union Rolling Work Programme, upon request of the European Commission or the ECCG.  CYBERSECURITY CERTIFICATION MARKET STUDY  April 2021  18  A ANNEX:  HOW TO ASSESS THE  COSTS AND BENEFITS OF A  CERTIFICATION INITIATIVE  Different methodologies could be used to estimate potential costs and benefits due to a  certification initiative. The choice of a method depends on several factors:  Consideration Description  The scope of a certification  scheme  When different types of costs can be broken down to a relatively  precise set of activities to be carried out, the costs are more easily  estimated adding up the various costs of these activities for a type of  relevant (impacted) stakeholder.  A more qualitative approach could be more suitable in a situation when  a complex certification scheme is considered, where a range of  starting positions across affected (and regulated by the cybersecurity  initiative) entities is wide and/or there are potentially numerous ways in  which stakeholders are impacted.  The expected compliance  costs and the expected  resources to be dedicated  The higher the expected costs (in particular the compliance costs) or  the wider the scope of the certification initiative (or the number of  different options for comparing different certification schemes), the  higher the amount of resources needs to be invested in estimating the  costs and benefits.  The availability of data The greater the availability of data, the more costs and benefits could  be quantitatively estimated.  Assumptions about costs and  benefits  Assumptions might affect the magnitude and size of the impact.  Therefore a check should be performed on how a change in  assumptions affects the costs and benefits.  The costs and benefits can be quantified through estimates based on financial, economic and  statistical data gathered from various sources through:   Determining costs and benefits from secondary sources (desk research)   Interviews   Survey   Delphi method   Modelling.  Annex D presents a table overview of different methods with their advantages, limitations and  potential risks.  A monetary value could be assigned to direct costs and other tangible costs (administrative  costs) and benefits. For other types of costs and benefits it could be difficult to assign a  monetary value. Instead, it could be assessed qualitatively. Most likely, the costs depend on a  specific form that a certification initiative takes, while benefits are most likely to be similar  CYBERSECURITY CERTIFICATION MARKET STUDY  April 2021  19  between different types of initiatives. If it is the case, then only costs of different forms of  initiatives could be assessed and compared.  The costs and benefits are to be compared over time. Therefore a discount rate could be  included in the calculation. In case different options of a cybersecurity certification initiative  concern the same timing, the assumptions about a discount rate are less relevant. On the other  hand, when costs and benefits are incurred at different times, it is necessary to apply such a  rate to compare them on an equivalent basis. The need for assigning a discount rate arises  from the fact that the value of one euro paid today is greater than the value of one euro paid at  some point in the future.  It is possible that a certification initiative might result in some distribution of a welfare between  businesses, consumers, or other players. It is therefore very important to assign which benefits  and costs are relevant for each type of stakeholders on the market of the Target of Analysis  (TOA).  A preliminary assessment of costs and benefits of a potential cybersecurity initiative can provide  a general indication of the scale of the costs and benefits likely to be imposed. A qualitative  assessment could be performed to rank the costs and benefits into low, moderate or high/major  in size. This helps to identify the major cost drivers of a cybersecurity initiative and might result  in reformulation of what the initiative might entail.  When specific data in question is not available, benchmark figures or rules of thumb could be  used. These are for example economy-wide average wage figures, instead of specific estimates  derived from industry of the likely wage costs and benchmark figures for overhead expenses.  Economy-wide averages for the estimation of costs and benefits  Data is available for the EU-27 in Eurostat on a range of indicators such as wage costs and  real added value; however, such averages calculated for the EU-27 most likely do not  reflect the costs in a specific sector that is not defined as part of NACE Rev 2 sectors or  industries.  A.1 NUMBER OF AFFECTED STAKEHOLDERS  Determining the size of the group that would be subject to a proposed cybersecurity initiative is  crucial to developing reliable estimates. The risk of making large errors in estimating these  numbers is often likely to be much greater than the risk of similarly large errors in estimating the  unit costs to individual businesses or regulated parties of complying with particular regulatory  requirements. This means that research on the number of affected parties should generally  receive high priority. When a cybersecurity initiative concerns a specific industry or industries,  potential sources of information on which to base estimates of the number of affected firms  include:   governmental statistical offices, for example, Eurostat;   industry associations;   academic research;   licensing or registration data if available;   information from regulators in other, comparable jurisdictions;   surveys of potentially affected industry sectors (either existing survey-based data or  the results of surveys undertaken as part of the costs and benefits assessment  process).  CYBERSECURITY CERTIFICATION MARKET STUDY  April 2021  20  If an initiative focuses on specific areas rather than affects a wide population, generally  available information from government statistical source is less likely to provide relevant  guidance. Consultation with industry associations or other representative bodies may provide  usable data, particularly where these bodies have a large membership, covering a significant  proportion of the affected group.  Surveys may be expensive and time consuming to conduct both for government and for  stakeholders. Therefore they may not be feasible to perform. However they could be justified if  expected impacts are significant. Small-scale surveys or Delphi method can provide broad  indications of the scale of expected impacts and feedback could be gathered on the magnitude  of the costs and benefits.  A.2 QUANTIFYING THE COSTS  The costs could be direct and indirect. The direct costs are those borne by the businesses  targeted by the cybersecurity initiative and authorities. The indirect costs are less tangible and  could be borne by those not targeted by the cybersecurity initiative.  The direct costs could be one-off or recurring costs. Therefore making a decision on the  frequency of costs will impact the quantification of the costs. It is included in each type of costs  quantification as frequency. The relevant costs parameters could be identified through the table  and the checklist of costs and benefits that could be associated with a certification initiative. In  case some costs are incurred in a situation “business as usual”, then those shall be subtracted  from the costs associated with a certification initiative.  The “business-as-usual” costs are usually assumptions about:   the costs that would not be avoided if a cybersecurity initiative were to be repealed in  case a cybersecurity initiative already exist; or   the costs that are already borne by various parties that will continue to bear these  costs if a new cybersecurity initiative is imposed.  The “business-as-usual” costs are often obtained by consulting targeted stakeholders or  experts. Since these costs are not a result of a newly imposed cybersecurity initiative, it could  be easier to simply mark which costs are “business-as-usual” and which ones are directly  associated with the cybersecurity initiative. In case it is not possible to do so, such costs could  be estimated by looking at the share of costs associated with a substantive obligation that are  borne by similar entities that are not targeted by specific legislative provisions: when this is the  case, you can observe the level of compliance costs for the “regulated” entities and the  “unregulated” ones, and take the difference as the relevant portion of costs to be considered in  your estimate.  All costs might be different over the life of the (proposed) cybersecurity initiative (not considering  the discount factor). If it is the case, such differences need to be accounted in the calculation. In  principle the costs are a multiplication of the amount of time spent on a specific action to comply  with the requirements of a cybersecurity initiative (list of specific actions associated could be  used from Annex B) and the salary costs for the actors performing the actions. The sub-sections  below provide an initial indication of how these costs can be quantified. However, for this initial  phase of the methodology, they are to be considered as relevant material of informational  nature only and not as part of the methodological steps.  CYBERSECURITY CERTIFICATION MARKET STUDY  April 2021  21  A.2.1 Quantifying the direct charges (costs to businesses)  The direct charges quantification  (Regulatory) Charges = Unit cost  × Q  where Unit Cost= the cost of the certification process  where Q (for Quantity) = Number of affected stakeholders x Frequency,  where Frequency is the number of times that the fee for a certification initiative is required to be  paid per year.  Number of affected stakeholders is equal to the number of businesses answered in the question  “Q3: How many (approximately) (potential) producers/manufacturers exist on the market of  TOA?” of “STEP 1: DETERMINE THE CONTEXT AND THE SCOPE OF THE TOA”, in case the  charges are borne by businesses producing/selling the certified product/service/process.  Some (or all) of these charges are zero sums, i.e. a charge for the business and income for the  public authority.  A.2.2 Quantifying the administrative costs6 (costs to businesses)  The administrative costs quantification  Administrative cost for businesses = ∑ 𝑷  × 𝑸  where P (for Price) = Labour cost + Equipment or supplies’ costs; and  where Q (for Quantity) = Number of businesses x Frequency,  Number of businesses is the number of relevant businesses covered under the actual regulation.  The ∑ indicates that the costs need to be summed across different types of costs.  The frequency of required actions that generate administrative costs could be one-off or  recurring at the determined frequency.   Relevant cost parameters.   Labour costs. The parameters to calculate labour costs will be:  o Time spent on a specific action is usually expressed in FTE of involved  organisations to measure the time spent on tasks.  o Salary could be measured in hourly pay or yearly salary of those performing  the action.  o Equipment or supplies’ costs are equipment costs to comply with a  certification scheme, in addition to the equipment costs for general production  processes. Although we expect that a certification scheme does not require  getting new equipment, it might still occur for example that types of equipment  and supplies could be necessary to set-up and run procedures to comply with  a cybersecurity initiative. The cost parameters will be the acquisition price and  the depreciation period.  If the information/actions are actually already part of “business-as-usual” practice, then those  should be subtracted from the costs here.  6  The approach to quantification of the administrative costs for businesses is the so-called Standard Cost Model. The cost  model distinguishes between the administrative costs and administrative burdens. For simplicity, only the term  ‘administrative costs’ is used, which actually refers to administrative burdens. For more information and examples, please  refer to SWD(2017) 350 Better Regulation Guidelines, Tool #60 THE STANDARD COST MODEL FOR ESTIMATING  ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS, available at https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/file_import/better-regulation-toolbox- 60_en_0.pdf.  https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/file_import/better-regulation-toolbox-60_en_0.pdf https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/file_import/better-regulation-toolbox-60_en_0.pdf  CYBERSECURITY CERTIFICATION MARKET STUDY  April 2021  22  If the information is not possible to quantify, it could be assessed qualitatively. For example by  completing the following affirmations with one of the suggested qualitative options: (“very little /  hardly”, “somewhat”, “satisfactorily”, or – “well”) Where “authority”, in the sentences below, we  refer to the authority in charge of administering and enforcing the certification initiative:  1. The data the authority expects me to provide are ___________in line with the data  from my own operating process which I already have available.  2. The way in which I am expected to provide the data to the government is __________  in line with how I have them available  3. I understand ___________ why the government wants to have this information from  me.  4. I understand ____________ why the government asks these details from me at these  intervals.  5. The government ensures __________  that I have to supply my data only once.  6. The amount of data asked by the government is ___________  proportionate to the  purpose.  7. This request for information has been worded in a way that every businessperson /  employee is ____________  able to carry it out.  A.2.3 Quantifying the other compliance costs (costs to businesses)  The other compliance costs quantification  Other compliance Costs = ∑ 𝑷  × 𝑸  where P (for Price) = Labour cost + Equipment or supplies’ costs; and  where Q (for Quantity) = Number of affected businesses x Frequency,  where Frequency is the number of times that the specific type of costs is required to be paid per  year.  The ∑ indicates that the costs need to be summed across different types of costs.  Similarly to the other types of costs, it is a sum of different types of costs, which are calculated  as a multiplication of the labour and equipment costs and number of businesses impacted.  A.2.4 Quantifying the Administration and Enforcement costs (costs to  the authorities in charge of administering the cybersecurity initiative)  Following the same approach as to the direct costs to businesses, the direct costs for authorities  in charge of administering the cybersecurity initiative (usually public authorities) can be  estimated first by defining the activities required to implement and enforce legislation, then  estimating their frequency and their cost (excluding the business-as-usual costs). Potentially  different authorities might be involved, then all the costs need to be calculated and summed.  These costs can vary significantly from option to option and from Member State to Member  State. Moreover, it is important to keep in mind that the costs incurred might differ for different  authorities: while private control organisations, for example, in case of a voluntary initiative, will  charge market fee rates, public authorities might be able to apply some cross-subsidization by  using tax incomes to compensate (a part of) the monitoring and compliance costs.  Annual budget data is usually the source that provides data to distinguish between relevant  administration and enforcement costs. However, it is also possible that the potential costs are  not accounted in the budgets and might require substantial effort in calculating them.  If it is difficult to quantify this type of costs, a qualitative assessment could be performed by  answering the following questions:  CYBERSECURITY CERTIFICATION MARKET STUDY  April 2021  23   Does a (new) certification initiative require the creation of new enforcement mechanisms  or institutions, or would it rely on the existing enforcement mechanisms?   Does the form of the certification initiative have an impact on the size of the costs? If  yes, would they vary significantly between different forms?   Is the expected size of the administration and enforcement costs large that it might mean  that one of the forms of a cybersecurity initiative is preferred?   What kind of costs are driving the size of the administration and enforcement costs? The  checklist of potential costs borne by authorities could be used here to identify such cost  drivers.  A significant risk of double counting the costs arises in relation to this type of costs. Most likely,  these costs will be recovered from regulated businesses or citizens via the direct charges. We  suggest to calculate the full costs for public authorities at this step. Where there is a clear  intention to recover some or all of these costs through the direct charges, calculations of the  expected revenue can also be made and should be included under the business (or citizen) cost  categories as appropriate. However, if this is done, it is important to clarify what is the net cost to  the public sector, as well as the gross cost. By doing so, you distinguish between:   The total cost to authorities for administration and enforcement;   The costs that are expected to be recovered by imposing charges on businesses;   The full cost to businesses of the compliance with a cybersecurity initiative, including the  direct charges.  A.2.5 Quantifying the indirect costs  These costs concern less tangible costs compared to the direct costs and therefore it is usually  not quantifiable. They also have a broader impact on the society. This could entail the impact for  related markets, for actors that are not directly targeted by the cybersecurity initiative or the  society at large.  It is possible (and likely) that the indirect costs are to be the same between different forms of a  cybersecurity initiative. If they are different, these costs need to be assessed qualitatively. If  different forms or options of cybersecurity initiative are considered, they can be assessed as  incremental to each other. In general these questions could be used to assess the indirect  costs:   Does (any of the options of the) cybersecurity initiative create indirect compliance costs?  - This could mean that additional costs are imposed by a certification initiative (or one of  the options of it) that lead for example to restrictions of output, higher downstream prices  or any other additional cost for economic agents other than those targeted by the  cybersecurity initiative;   Does (any of the options of the) cybersecurity initiative lead to substitution effects?  - For example, would citizens or businesses other than the regulated entities shift to  alternative sources of supply? Would citizens or businesses other than the targeted  businesses shift to alternative modes of consumption?   Does (any of the options of the) cybersecurity initiative lead to increased transaction costs?  - For example, would it increase the cost of negotiations between various parties, the  costs of information gathering for users, the costs of looking for a different supplier?  CYBERSECURITY CERTIFICATION MARKET STUDY  April 2021  24   Does (any of the options of the) cybersecurity initiative result in a reduced competition or  market access on the market of the TOA or reduced investment or innovation?  - For example, the following might be considered: the cybersecurity initiative makes it  more difficult for new businesses to enter the market of the TOA or it prevents  businesses from competing aggressively between each other, or businesses collude on  the market of the TOA and therefore it becomes potentially detrimental to end users.  A.3 QUANTIFYING THE BENEFITS  In general, benefits due to a cybersecurity initiative (or any policy initiative) are more difficult to  quantify compared to the costs, since they are less tangible. Nonetheless, some of the  categories of benefits could be quantified. Most likely different options of a cybersecurity  initiative result in very similar benefits with primarily varying costs. If that is the case, the  benefits could be assessed qualitatively. One way to quantify the benefits could be to quantify  those businesses for whom the harm, that a certification initiative aims to solve (in case of  market assessment) or was introduced to solve (in case of impact assessment), would be  reduced if a certification initiative were to be introduced or was introduced.  A.3.1 Quantifying the improved market efficiency  Usually this category of benefits is expressed in cost savings. This could be assessed with the  same steps as the calculation of direct costs, when a certification initiative leads to a reduction  in the direct charges, reduction in compliance costs and/or administration and enforcement  costs (steps 1-4 on quantification of direct costs).  Other type of benefits in this category could be the increased willingness to pay for a certified  (or complying with the cybersecurity initiative) product/service/process. This goes hand in hand  also with stimulating innovation and technological progress, improving information available to  users and other market players. Such non-market benefits are often valued using techniques  which capture the sum of individual preferences, which are themselves modelled using  techniques such as willingness to pay or, alternatively, via simulated experiments observing  what people would actually do in different future situations as opposed to what people think they  will do.  A.3.2 Quantifying the indirect benefits  Indirect benefits concern individuals and business that are not targeted by a certification  initiative and take advantage of positive effects due to business complying with the initiative.  These might be difficult to quantify, therefore the questions below provide guidance on what  kind of information is being targeted:   Does (any of the options of the) cybersecurity initiative lead to indirect compliance benefits (“a  positive externality”)?  - For example, a common standard could be introduced in a certain sector that might  generate important savings for downstream players; legislation that imposed  interoperability between standard interfaces for applications installed on smartphones  might reduce development costs for app developers; etc. these benefits have to be  assessed and, where possible, monetized.   Does (any of the options of the) cybersecurity initiative result in macroeconomic benefits  spreading to other sectors?  - If the expected macroeconomic benefits are expected to be significant for the whole  economy, it could be estimated using partial or general equilibrium models for  quantification of the results. The results then will constitute net benefits (benefits minus  costs). Usually these models rely on a lot of assumptions and require a lot of data for each  CYBERSECURITY CERTIFICATION MARKET STUDY  April 2021  25  sector and on how sectors are linked. They also rely on the publicly available data for the  whole economy and follow NACE Rev.2 sector classifications that do not allow to create  distinction between IoT markets for example. Unless these models are developed  internally, an external party needs to be contracted to perform an analysis requiring this  modelling.   Does (any of the options of the) cybersecurity initiative lead to other non monetizable  benefits? For example, demonstrating compliance to legal obligations or cybersecurity  practises that are considered as best practises.  A.3.3 Single market considerations and Acting at the EU level7  A specific type of benefits can occur when you’re considering acting at EU level. This concerns  options or initiatives that have an impact of the Single Market, particularly when the initiatives  lead to the harmonisation of national frameworks (legislation). Therefore benefits could arise  when national framework is fragmented and inconsistent, and action at EU level is taken to  harmonise it. Therefore businesses that would like to trade cross-border, would not have costs  such as:   Compliance with national frameworks;   Adjustments of standards or personnel to deal with national requirements;   Additional administrative costs to provide other information (for example, additional  paperwork).  Once those companies enter cross-border markets, they can benefit from economies of scale,  leading to a stronger competition on those markets.  While there could be clear benefits for such type of companies, the harmonisation might result  in significant adaptations and changes for certain Member States. For example, when there is  an existing certification scheme in France and a completely different certification scheme is  introduced at the EU level, it would mean that the national framework in France has to  completely change and adjust to the new EU certification scheme.  The quantification of the impacts of such a policy could be rather abstract, therefore seeking  external advice is suggested. Specific questions that could guide identification of such an  impact could be:   Is the regulatory framework on cybersecurity harmonized?   Do businesses and end users face different cybersecurity requirements in each Member  State?   Are certain requirement more cumbersome for foreign companies?   If a certification initiative is imposed at the EU level, will it lead to increase or decrease in  choice for end users? Will there be more competition? Will it lead to improvement of the  cybersecurity performance for the whole EU?  7 Further guidance could be found in SWD(2017) 350 Better Regulation Guidelines, Tool #21 IMPACTS ON THE  INTERNAL MARKET, available at https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/file_import/better-regulation-toolbox-60_en_0.pdf.  https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/file_import/better-regulation-toolbox-60_en_0.pdf  CYBERSECURITY CERTIFICATION MARKET STUDY  April 2021  26  B ANNEX:  CHECKLIST OF POTENTIAL  ACTIVITIES PER TYPE OF  COST OF A CERTIFICATION  INITIATIVE  The following checklist includes a wide range of costs that are typically incurred by business,  public authorities and citizens respectively:  Type of costs Example of a cost  Costs borne by Businesses  Administrative costs Reporting/giving notice to the authority in charge of enforcement  Administrative costs Familiarising oneself with the regulatory requirements  Administrative costs Assessing options (including benefit/cost assessment)  Administrative costs Choosing an option and developing a compliance strategy  Administrative costs Applying for a certification  Administrative costs Time spent on cooperation with authority in charge of granting/enforcing obligations  Administrative costs Information provision (e.g. for disclosure based regulation)  Charges  Fees, levies, taxes, cost of a certification (some or all of these charges are zero sums, i.e. a  charge for the businesses and income for the public authority)  Other compliance costs Procuring equipment if required  Other compliance costs Staff recruitment and/or training  Other compliance costs Purchase of external services  Other compliance costs Changing production, warehousing and/or distribution processes  Administrative costs Monitoring/audit of compliance and review of compliance performance  Other compliance costs Design and implementation of any needed changes to the compliance strategy.

Method Application Advantages Limitations and risks  Survey  The questionnaire for  the survey could  contain information on  direct labour costs  (wage or salary costs),  overhead costs,  material costs or any  other type of costs and  benefits that could be  foreseen. The  averages could be  calculated for any type  of sector or industry in  question.   Depending on the response rate  and representativeness of the  results, questionnaires can be  used for generalisation or  approximation to larger  population beyond the sample or  a population of stakeholders in a  similar sector or industry.   Questionnaires make it possible  to gather a large amount of data  in a relatively short period of time  and with relatively limited costs.   Online questionnaires can incite  high rates of participants, as they  are often seen as not taking up  too much time.   A survey can be quite time consuming  for the surveyed stakeholders or  require gathering information that they  don’t have at hand.   It may be difficult to obtain a good  response rate from the relevant  stakeholder group. Often respondents  lack motivation to respond.  Respondents might therefore not  reply and the researcher risks a low  response rate, potentially impacting  the representativeness of the sample.   If the questionnaire is not well  designed and sufficiently clear there  is a risk for misinterpretation of  questions and options by the  respondents with the consequential  risk of lack of consistency between  responses.  Interviews  The questionnaire  could contain the same  information as in a  survey questionnaire;  however, most likely  only qualitative  information could be  gathered.   Interviews can combine structure  with flexibility. Especially in  comparison to surveys,  interviews offer the opportunity to  obtain clarifications of incomplete  and ambiguous answers.   Information is generated in an  interactive manner between the  researcher and the interviewee,  which makes the interview  dynamic in nature.   The researcher uses a range of  probes and techniques to actively  achieve depth of answer in terms  of penetration, exploration and  explanation.   Interviews with open-ended questions  produce less statistically valuable  data and may not be the right tool for  obtaining representative results. They  are hence not the ideal tool to collect  quantitative data from stakeholders.   Information collected through different  interviews, especially less structured  ones, might not be comparable and  can be hard to aggregate.   Interviews are a time-consuming tool  in terms of resources needed to set  practical arrangements, particularly if  conducted individually.   The interviewer needs a thorough  understanding of the topic close to  the level of the interviewee, to be able  to identify the most relevant and  precise questions, and to know when  to ask follow-up questions. When  working on a new subject, gaining  deep knowledge on the topic before  engaging in interviews can be  challenging.  CYBERSECURITY CERTIFICATION MARKET STUDY  April 2021  30  Method Application Advantages Limitations and risks  Delphi  method8  The Delphi method  could be applied to  gather information on  costs and benefits  when such information  does not exist or is  very hard to find or the  sources of it are  questionable. A  questionnaire could be  drafted for a number of  geographically spread  experts in certain fields  (like sector experts) to  gather such  information. The  collective decision is  drawn on the basis of  a number of iterations.   Even though experts might be  aware that they participate in a  Delphi method together,  anonymity of answers ensures  that none of experts is influenced  by somebody else’s opinion.   This method offers a great  possibility to gather data when  statistical sources, academic and  grey literature do not provide  needed information or when  there is no agreement among  experts.   It could be an alternative to  studies and reports that require  payments. Though it could be  weighted.   It could be time consuming to gather  information from the experts and feed  it back to the whole group.   Continued commitment is required  from the experts who answer the  questions through multiple iterations.   The reliability of results or answers of  experts could be questioned, as there  is most likely no evidence for the  views that experts express.  Assessment  of a  willingness  to pay  through  stated and  revealed  preferences9  This method allows to  assess the impact on  citizens and  consumers through  analysis of behaviour  or by asking users on  their preferences  regarding certain  changes in the  regulatory  environment.   This approach relies on the  design of questionnaires, and  conducting surveys, therefore the  advantages are similar to the  ones described above for the  survey.   These methods could be rather  theoretical and time consuming.   Organising a setting where  consumers indicated what they would  do hypothetically might not yield the  results that could actually happen in  practice, therefore the construction of  a questionnaire is very important.  Determining  costs and  benefits  from  secondary  sources  Methods described  above could be difficult  to implement because  of time or resource  constraints. Therefore  the impacts estimated  as part of another  research, report or  study could be used as  a proxy.   Low cost approach for obtaining  quantitative and qualitative  information.   It could be robust when multiple  sources are used.   It should be treated with caution and  properly justified. It requires  documenting assumptions and  perhaps might require further  adjustments.  Modelling,  for example  computable  general  equilibrium  models  Modelling could be  used to predict the  amount of net benefits  (benefits minus costs)  generated by a certain  regulatory intervention.   Models are designed to analyse  how changes in one industry,  market or region lead to a  reallocation of resources among  several dimensions like sectors  and countries.   The models are particularly  helpful when expected spill over  effects are significant.   It relies on pre-existing data that  are available from most national  statistical offices.   This could be very resource and time  intensive. It relies on models, which if  not developed in-house, require  contracting external experts to run the  models.   The models rely on a number of  assumptions and are very data  intensive.  8 https://research.phoenix.edu/content/research-methodology-group/delphi-method  9 Revealed preferences method refers to observing what consumers would pay to achieve a certain outcome; while stated  preferences assessment refers to asking consumers directly how much they would be willing to pay to achieve a certain  outcome in the future.

For more traditional and stable markets, data sources such as  Eurostat, the OECD, or the various national statistics offices can provide a solid basis upon  which to understand the overall size of a market in terms of turnover, employment, and other  relevant factors. But the purpose of these public data sets is to understand macro-level  developments in the economy, and public data sets also tend to defer to collecting information  over relatively long timeframes. This can lead to data being collected and collated into  categories that do not have much use in a fluid market.  As an example, the European Commission, through the statistical body of Eurostat, classifies a  lot of the data that it collects along the Statistical Classification of Economic Activities in the  European Community / Nomenclature Générale des Activités Économiques dans les  Communautés Européennes10, commonly referred to as NACE, a scheme that has not been  revised since 2006. Many ICT activities are categorised under category J, which is “information  and communication”. Categories here are quite large and fail to capture any nuance in the  market. Just a few examples of categories in the scheme include:  J58.2 - Software publishing  J58.2.1 - Publishing of computer games  J58.2.9 - Other software publishing  J61 - Telecommunications  J61.1 - Wired telecommunications activities  J61.1.0 - Wired telecommunications activities  J61.2 - Wireless telecommunications activities  J61.2.0 - Wireless telecommunications activities  J62 - Computer programming, consultancy and related activities  J62.0 - Computer programming, consultancy and related activities  J62.0.1 - Computer programming activities  J62.0.2 - Computer consultancy activities  J62.0.3 - Computer facilities management activities  J62.0.9 - Other information technology and computer service activities  J63 - Information service activities  J63.1 - Data processing, hosting and related activities; web portals  J63.1.1 - Data processing, hosting and related activities  J63.1.2 - Web portals  With this critique offered, there are some public data sets that provide unique and specific data  for particular markets. The International Telecommunication Union (ITU), a United Nations (UN)  10 https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics- explained/index.php?title=Glossary:Statistical_classification_of_economic_activities_in_the_European_Community_(NACE)/fr  https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php?title=Glossary:Statistical_classification_of_economic_activities_in_the_European_Community_(NACE)/fr https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php?title=Glossary:Statistical_classification_of_economic_activities_in_the_European_Community_(NACE)/fr  CYBERSECURITY CERTIFICATION MARKET STUDY  April 2021  32  agency specialised in ICT, provides relevant and quoted statistics on telecommunications,  broadband and broadcasting.  While some higher level studies managed to use public data sources to conduct their analysis,  the more relevant and specific articles that were categorised as a part of the analysis either  used their own data sets  - not all of which were of clear quality or gathered in a  methodologically transparent way - or were based on survey data. The latter category seemed  to be the most consistent way that market analyses in this field collected data, drawing often on  proprietary surveys.  Another familiar means to collect data was via national associations and cybersecurity  authorities, which is a common way to get access to data. One challenge of this source of data,  particularly from associations, is that the data they share will tend to support a particular  viewpoint and access to this data can often depend on whether the association feels that a  report will fall within their interests. It may also be selective and can also lack transparency,  which introduces questions of bias (how many companies were surveyed, what size, what  geographical spread and many other questions).  Finally, there are private data sets that are collected by well-established firms, which are sold to  governments and consultancies for analysis. Private-sector datasets tend to provide the  greatest level of specificity, given that other private companies use them to make business  decisions, but they also create challenges for market analyses that are used in a public sector  setting, namely:    The costs for accessing private-sector datasets can be quite high.    Private-sector datasets can come with Intellectual Property Right (IPR) restrictions,  meaning that certain details cannot be published, which may not be feasible in a  public-sector context where the results of a market analysis need to be shared with  stakeholders and even the general public.    Working with private-sector datasets works better in cases where the market analysis  is a one-time exercise. In some cases, it can be useful to conduct the same analysis  several times to understand how the market is evolving, and this comparison works  best if the methodology can be replicated across studies. This means that the same  datasets should be used, which means continually purchasing datasets from the same  vendors. This creates vendor lock-in, and the potential for vendors to exploit their  position for financial advantage.

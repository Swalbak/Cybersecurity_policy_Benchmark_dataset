Unauthorized  modification of BIOS firmware constitutes a significant threat because of the BIOS’s unique and  privileged position within the PC architecture. The document focuses on two scenarios: detecting changes  to the system BIOS code stored on the system flash, and detecting changes to the system BIOS  configuration. The document is intended for hardware and software vendors that develop products that  can support secure BIOS integrity measurement mechanisms, and may also be of use for organizations  developing enterprise procurement or deployment strategies for these technologies.

computers such as desktops and laptops rely on the Basic Input/Output System (BIOS) to initialize  their hardware during boot. The BIOS is firmware, and it can be configured. If the BIOS code or  configuration is altered from the intended state, either maliciously or accidentally, the desktop or laptop  may experience losses of confidentiality, integrity, and availability, including system instability, system  failure, and information leakage. Also, the desktop or laptop could be vulnerable to more elaborate attacks  such as covert monitoring, and it could be used as a stepping stone for attacking other systems. These  consequences underscore why it is so important to detect changes to the BIOS code and configuration—  and this can be accomplished by measuring and monitoring the integrity of the BIOS.  This publication explains the fundamentals of BIOS integrity measurement, such as basic requirements  that must be met in order to measure BIOS integrity, and typical data flows for BIOS integrity  measurement and reporting. This material provides a foundation for the core of the document, which  presents guidelines to hardware and software vendors that develop products that can support secure BIOS  integrity measurement mechanisms. These guidelines define in detail the requirements and  recommendations for vendors to follow in support of BIOS integrity measurement.  The following are key requirements and recommendations for vendors supporting BIOS integrity  measurement. Note that the formal declarations of these requirements and recommendations occur in  Section 3; these are summaries and do not take the place of the more detailed Section 3 statements.  Provide the hardware support necessary to implement credible Roots of Trust for BIOS integrity  measurements.  Roots of Trust are components (software, hardware, or hybrid) and computing engines that constitute a  set of unconditionally trusted functions. Reliable and trustworthy BIOS integrity measurement and  reporting depend upon software agents; each software agent relies upon Roots of Trust, and the level of  trustworthiness in each agent depends on its Roots of Trust. BIOS integrity measurement requires the  coordination of a Measurement Agent to harvest measurements, a Storage Agent to protect the  measurements from modification until they can be reported, and a Reporting Agent to reliably report the  measurements. Each of these agents has a corresponding Root of Trust (Root of Trust for Measurement,  etc.) These Roots of Trust must act in concert and build on each other to enable reliable and trustworthy  measurement, reporting, and verification of BIOS integrity measurements.  Enable endpoints to measure the integrity of all BIOS executable components and configuration  data components at boot time.  A key factor in a meaningful integrity measurement comparison scheme is establishing and maintaining,  with confidence, a known baseline of attributes and measurements. Endpoint vendors have various ways  to convey attributes to users; regardless of how this is done, the reason for the attributes is to give the user  a means of assessing the validity of the BIOS integrity measurements reported by the endpoint and  developing a level of confidence in the reports it receives about the overall health status of the endpoint.  This publication defines the attributes that endpoint vendors must provide and the minimal essential BIOS  integrity measurements that all endpoints must be capable of reporting.  Securely transmit measurements of BIOS integrity from endpoints to the Measurement Assessment  Authority (MAA).  When measurements are reliably and robustly reported, the MAA can accurately determine the state of  the security relevant BIOS configuration items on each endpoint. This allows the MAA to report on and  1  BIOS INTEGRITY MEASUREMENT GUIDELINES (DRAFT)  act upon the items with which the organization is concerned. Secure transmission of BIOS integrity  measurements ensures that measurements are not modified, disclosed, or forged in transit by malicious  parties. Further, proper selection of transmission protocols should ensure maximum interoperability,  freshness, and efficiency.  2  BIOS INTEGRITY MEASUREMENT GUIDELINES (DRAFT)  1. Introduction  1.1 Authority  The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) developed this document in furtherance of its  statutory responsibilities under the Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA) of 2002,  Public Law 107-347.  NIST is responsible for developing standards and guidelines, including minimum requirements, for  providing adequate information security for all agency operations and assets; however, such standards and  guidelines shall not apply to national security systems. This guideline is consistent with the requirements  of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-130, Section 8b (3), “Securing Agency  Information Systems,” as analyzed in A-130, Appendix IV: Analysis of Key Sections. Supplemental  information is provided in A-130, Appendix III.  This guideline has been prepared for use by Federal agencies. It may be used by nongovernmental  organizations on a voluntary basis and is not subject to copyright, although attribution is requested.  Nothing in this document should be taken to contradict standards and guidelines made mandatory and  binding on Federal agencies by the Secretary of Commerce under statutory authority nor should these  guidelines be interpreted as altering or superseding the existing authorities of the Secretary of Commerce,  Director of the OMB, or any other Federal official.  1.2 Purpose and Scope  This document outlines the security components and security guidelines needed to establish a secure  Basic Input/Output System (BIOS) integrity measurement and reporting chain. BIOS is a critical security  component in systems due to its unique and privileged position within the personal computer (PC)  architecture. A malicious or outdated BIOS could allow or be part of a sophisticated, targeted attack on an  organization —either a permanent denial of service (if the BIOS is corrupted) or a persistent malware  presence (if the BIOS is implanted with malware).  This document identifies two motivating scenarios in Section 2.1 for the guidelines in this document.  First, the BIOS integrity measurement mechanisms are intended to detect changes to the system BIOS  code stored on the system flash. Unauthorized changes to the system BIOS code could allow malicious  software to run during the boot process. Second, the mechanisms are intended to detect changes to the  configuration of the system BIOS. Unauthorized system BIOS configuration changes could place systems  in insecure configurations, leaving them vulnerable to attack.  The guidelines in this document are intended to facilitate the development of products that can detect  problems with the BIOS so that organizations can take appropriate remedial action to prevent or limit  harm. The security controls and procedures specified in this document are oriented to desktops and  laptops deployed in an enterprise environment.  While this publication focuses on security properties and capabilities for BIOS integrity measurement  products, it will also provide administrators and security officers in organizations with a better  understanding of the assurances that these types of products can provide, and the procedures that will  need to be integrated into system previsioning and management processes once these technologies are  deployed. The guidelines in this document can only be met with a combination of hardware and software  support on devices spread across an organizations information technology infrastructure. This includes  supporting roots of trust and security software on endpoint devices for obtaining and reporting  3  BIOS INTEGRITY MEASUREMENT GUIDELINES (DRAFT)  measurements, support for requesting and interpreting measurements on enterprise-management systems,  and potentially support on network devices to remediate problems. These components will be critical  elements of a BIOS integrity measurement system.  1.3 Audience  The intended audience for this document includes hardware and software vendors that develop products  that can support secure BIOS integrity measurement mechanisms. These include the endpoint vendor,  typically the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM), the operating system (OS) vendor, and security  application software vendors. System administrators and information system security professionals may  also consult this document to understand the capabilities of these products and the procedures that will  need to be incorporated into their system management processes when deploying these technologies.  The material in this document is technically oriented, and it is assumed that readers have at least a basic  understanding of system and network security. The document provides background information to help  such readers understand the topics that are discussed. Readers are encouraged to take advantage of other  resources (including those listed in this document) for more detailed information.  1.4 Document Structure  The remainder of this document is organized into the following major sections and appendices:  ●  Section 2 presents an overview of BIOS integrity measurement and its role in the enterprise in  detecting attacks against the BIOS in an operational environment.  ●  Section 3 describes the components necessary to measure the integrity of a BIOS and the security  guidelines recommended for each component.  ●  Appendix A contains a summary of the security guidelines for system BIOS integrity  measurement implementations.  ●  Appendix B defines acronyms, abbreviations, and terms used in this document.  ●  Appendix C identifies references.  ●  Appendix D contains a list of examples for how a company might choose to implement Roots of  Trust.  ●  Appendix E contains a list of examples for how a company might choose to implement the  guidelines using existing capabilities.  1.5 Document Conventions  The key words “MUST”, “MUST NOT”, “REQUIRED”, “SHALL”, “SHALL NOT”, “SHOULD”,  “SHOULD NOT”, “RECOMMENDED”, “MAY”, and “OPTIONAL” in this document are to be  interpreted as described in Request for Comment (RFC) 2119 [IETF-RFC-2119]. When these words  appear in regular case, such as “should” or “may”, they are not intended to be interpreted as RFC 2119  key words.  Within this publication, the criteria for assigning requirements to MUST/SHALL, SHOULD, and MAY  are as follows:  MUSTs/SHALLs: Requirements that are needed to support the scenarios outlined in Section 2, AND  are feasible in the near term with currently available technology.  4  BIOS INTEGRITY MEASUREMENT GUIDELINES (DRAFT)  5  SHOULDs: Capabilities that are highly desirable and may be required in some circumstances to  support a particular operational need or robustness level.  MAYs: Optional requirements that may be desirable under some circumstances.  BIOS INTEGRITY MEASUREMENT GUIDELINES (DRAFT)  5  2. Background  Client computers such as desktops and laptops contain program code that facilitates the hardware  initialization process. The code is stored in non-volatile memory and is commonly referred to as boot  firmware. The primary firmware used to initialize the system is called the Basic Input/Output System  (BIOS) or the system BIOS. If a BIOS is altered from its intended state, either maliciously or accidentally,  the device on which it was altered may have a negative impact on the organization because the device is  not necessarily operating in its intended state. Possible consequences include system instability, system  failure, information leakage, and other losses of confidentiality, integrity, and availability. In addition, the  system could be vulnerable to more elaborate attacks such as covert monitoring, and attackers could use  the system as a stepping stone for attacking other systems. These examples illustrate why it is so  important to detect changes to the BIOS and its configuration by measuring and monitoring its integrity.  This section provides an overview of BIOS integrity measurement (BIM) and its role in the organization  in detecting, reporting, and mitigating attacks against the BIOS in an operational environment. The  primary components required to accomplish this are identified and the threats addressed by this  methodology are described.  2.1 BIOS Integrity Measurement Scenarios  This section presents scenarios that define candidate use cases, which drive the requirements and  recommendations presented throughout the rest of this document. These use cases serve as a basis to  identify user actions, associated transactions, inherent risks, and potential security mitigations.  The scenarios are predicated on objective state and process maturity for IT organizations in the area of  BIM. To a large degree, this objective state closely mirrors the best practices employed by many  organizations in the area of patch management for endpoints today. Specifically, organizations are  expected to implement a provisioning process for new endpoints whereby BIM is fully integrated into the  model. For example, provisioning an endpoint would include these additional BIOS integrity-specific  activities that complement existing imaging, asset tracking, and registration activities:  ● Installing and/or verifying the correct BIOS revision for a given client  ● Imaging the BIOS with the appropriate BIOS settings  ● Setting BIOS passwords  ● Asserting any security controls requiring physical presence (which may include the Trusted  Platform Module (TPM))  ● Registering the endpoint identity and integrity metrics in the pertinent IT databases  Changes in any of these security variables may imply an anomalous situation and potentially more  hazardous effects. Client operating system agents exist today that report basic information about these  settings at the network management level, and they are a good initial tool for assessing BIOS security  posture. As soon as feasible, though, these reporting agents need to be migrated to rely on integrity  infrastructure anchored to tamperproof roots of trust.  2.1.1 Scenario 1: Something has changed in the system BIOS  BIOS updates are frequently released for client computers. These updates often fix bugs in the power  management subsystem, hard disk or network management, or other important components. However, a  BIOS could also be changed for malicious purposes. It is important that system administrators be able to  BIOS INTEGRITY MEASUREMENT GUIDELINES (DRAFT)  6  tell what version of BIOS is loaded on a device so as to be able to correctly manage it. This must be done  while meeting the following basic challenges:  ● IT management has to be able to trust that the measurements of BIOS firmware collected are  correct.  o There needs to be a root of trust to trust the collection of BIOS firmware integrity  measurements.  o An initial valid baseline of BIOS firmware integrity measurements must be collected,  potentially using the device’s root of trust to collect and report the baseline measurements.  o BIOS firmware integrity measurements must be provably fresh (the response is not just a  replay of an earlier good response).  o BIOS firmware integrity measurements must have provable integrity (it has not changed  between the responder and recipient).  o The origin of BIOS firmware integrity measurements must be established (it came from the  machine that IT thinks it came from).  ● IT management has to be able to interpret reported BIOS firmware integrity measurements.  o Standard formats are important.  o The variability of systems needs to be accounted for.  ● The users and administrators must know when something has changed in the BIOS without  having to perform extensive calculations by hand.  2.1.2 Scenario 2: Something has changed in the BIOS configuration settings  BIOS settings have a large influence on the security of a system. A partial list of questions to be answered  regarding settings includes:  ● Passwords  o Has the administrator password been set?  o Has the Power On Password been set?  o Has a hard disk password been set?  ● BIOS-based management (BBM) software  o Has it been turned on?  o What is the configuration of the BIOS-based management software?  ● Boot  o Has the boot order changed?  o Will the computer boot from anything other than the hard disk?  ● Ports and other hardware interfaces  o Are USB ports turned on?  o Are 1394 ports turned on?  o Are PCMCIA or smart card readers turned on?  BIOS INTEGRITY MEASUREMENT GUIDELINES (DRAFT)  7  o Are Near Field Communication (NFC) ports turned on?  Any changes to these settings can indicate that the system has become less secure or has been  compromised. Like the first scenario, it is important that both users and administrators be able to  determine what the BIOS settings are and if they are within policy. This document requires capabilities  that will allow the administrator to tell if a BIOS configuration setting has changed, and encourages the  use of capabilities that will allow that administrator to distinguish which settings have changed.  BIOS configuration changes require the following, which are similar to, but extend the capabilities of  BIOS code changes:  ● IT management has to be able to trust that the BIOS configuration integrity measurements are  correct.  o There needs to be a root of trust to trust the BIOS configuration integrity measurements.  o The measurements must be provably fresh.  o The measurements must have provable integrity.  o The origin of the measurements must be established.  ● IT management has to be able to interpret the response.  o Standard formats are important.  o The variability of systems needs to be accounted for.  2.2 BIOS Integrity Measurement Flow  In order to measure BIOS integrity, certain basic requirements must be met, including:  ● A means of generating and collecting the measurements  ● A means of storing the measurements that is either tamper resistant or tamper evident  ● A means of conveying the measurements to an analyzing agent  ● A means of analyzing the measured result, and a means of administering a machine based on the  results of that determination  The endpoint device must have a means of measuring the BIOS firmware and forwarding those  measurements to an administrative authority. The endpoint must do this while protecting the integrity,  authenticity, non-repudiation, and, in some cases, the confidentiality of those measurements.  Figure 1 illustrates the architecture that supports the generation, forwarding, and analysis of BIMs as well  as remediation actions based on the analysis. These solutions may be provided by a single vendor or a  combination of vendors. On the endpoint, the Roots of Trust for Measurement, Storage, and Reporting  form the foundation for providing the necessary security services. Section 3.1 covers roots of trust in  greater depth.

The Measurement generation  and Reporting Agents act on the measurement target and directly leverage the roots of trust to provide  security protection for the individual measurements and for the measurement and reporting processes.  Sections 3.2 and 3.3 provide more insight into both the measurements and associated processes. The  Collection and Transmission Agents provide a means of reliably collecting and transmitting the  measurements to a Measurement Assessment Authority (MAA) for further analysis. Sections 3.4 and 3.5  discuss functions of these agents. The Remediation Agent discussed in Section 3.6 provides a means for  an administrative authority to take action to remedy any issues with the endpoint discovered through the  analysis of the BIOS measurements.  In assessing the measurements, the MAA references a set of characteristics. These sets come in two  varieties: either endpoint attributes and measurements of BIOS code provided and vouched for (using  certificates) by the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM), Value Added Reseller (VAR), or an  Independent Software Vendor (ISV), or measurements of configuration settings gathered by the  user/administrator of the endpoint during initial provisioning of the endpoint or the MAA. The  assemblage of ideal measurement characteristics is referred to as golden measurements.  BIOS INTEGRITY MEASUREMENT GUIDELINES (DRAFT)  9  The MAA may host a number of services, such as a management console or dashboard that provides an  easy user interface to the analysis of BIOS attributes and measurements, allowing an administrator or  analyst to quickly determine the following:  ● The trustworthiness of the endpoint device reports  ● If machines are compliant (match the current set of golden measurements)  ● If machines are in need of remediation (BIOS settings are out of compliance or older golden  measurements are in use)  ● If machines are potentially dangerous (certain measurements are known to indicate malicious  activity)  Based on these reports, machines can be allowed or denied access to resources (e.g., allowed access to  network resources, allowed restricted access to network resources, such as a remediation network, or  denied access), or the reports could trigger other administrative actions.  Figure 1 depicts a typical data flow for BIOS integrity measurement and reporting:  1. An initial set of trusted measurements (golden measurements) is obtained. These measurements  are either provided from third parties (e.g., OEM) to the MAA or generated at initial provisioning  by system administrators.  2. During the boot of the endpoint, a sequence of measurements is made of the BIOS firmware and  its configuration settings by firmware in a trust chain rooted in a Root of Trust for Measurement  (RTM).  The RTM stores a hashed representation of these is stored or protected by the Root of  Trust for Storage (RTS), and a log from which they can be reconstructed is stored somewhere in  memory so that a Transmission Agent may reconstruct the measurements.  3. In response to an action by either the endpoint requesting a service or an MAA request, the MAA  generates a request for measurements, including a random nonce. The Transmission Agent  receives this request, determines that it pertains to BIOS Integrity Measurements, and therefore  passes it on to the Collection Agent.  4. The Collection Agent parses the request and passes the nonce to the Reporting Agent, which uses  the Root of Trust for Reporting to obtain a signature of the nonce and the stored hash  representation of the measurements.  5. The Reporting Agent passes that data (along with the log retrieved from memory) back to the  Collection Agent.  6. The Collection Agent formats this data in a standard format and passes it back to the  Transmission Agent.  7. The Transmission Agent transmits the data to the MAA’s Verification Agent.  8. The Verification Agent verifies the signature over the hashes by verifying both the public key  used to sign them and the signature itself, and that the nonce contained in the report matches the  nonce sent in the request for measurements. It then compares those signed measurements with the  golden measurements it obtained earlier.  9. Results of that comparison, collated with other such comparisons from other machines may be  displayed via a user interface (such as a management console or dashboard) to the administrator  and/or provided to an automated enforcement/access point.  BIOS INTEGRITY MEASUREMENT GUIDELINES (DRAFT)  10  10. If the results are provided to an automated enforcement/access point, the administrator or his  proxy then makes a decision pursuant to the results of the comparison, which may be to allow or  deny network access, send a signal to a Remediation Agent, or possibly send a service technician  to the machine to determine the reason for an erroneous result.  2.3 Transitioning to the Desired State  In the desired, or objective, state for BIM, measurement of BIOS is part of routine and automated client  scanning. As organizations progress from where they are today to the desired state, several steps must be  taken. Initially the measurements will only be collected and stored along with other endpoint health data.  This data will then be reviewed and analyzed on a regular basis to develop an understanding of the  baseline behavior of client BIOS within the organization. Anomalies will be investigated and manually  remediated. As dashboard suites and other operational tools are updated to incorporate BIOS integrity  information as first order data, the sideline activity and responsibility for BIM can be transitioned to the  standard IT operations team. Over time, this will become simply another standard offering of IT services.  BIOS INTEGRITY MEASUREMENT GUIDELINES (DRAFT)  11  3. BIM Functional Components  The following sections provide a description and associated requirement guidelines for the BIM  functional components:  ● Section 3.1 addresses Roots of Trust (RoTs).  ● Section 3.2 defines the establishment of BIOS integrity attribute and measurement baselines.  ● Section 3.3 addresses BIOS integrity reporting.  ● Section 3.4 defines the collection and transmission of BIMs to the MAA.  ● Section 3.5 describes and defines the requirements for the MAA itself.  ● Section 3.6 addresses potential remediation actions based on the collected and transmitted  measurements and attributes.  3.1 Roots of Trust (RoTs)  Roots of Trust (RoTs) are at the foundation of any BIOS integrity assurance. RoTs are components  (software, hardware, or hybrid) and computing engines that constitute a set of unconditionally trusted  functions, and that must always behave in an expected manner because their misbehavior cannot be  detected. They are particularly critical for BIOS integrity measurement since the BIOS is generally  responsible for the configuration of the software execution environment, including the mapping of  physical memory and devices.  The trustworthiness of Software Agents that leverage one or more RoTs is dependent on the  trustworthiness of the RoT itself and its attack surface. The complete set of RoTs has at least the  minimum set of capabilities to enable the measurement, storage, and reporting of the endpoint  characteristics that affect the endpoint’s trustworthiness. A Hardware RoT is preferred over a Software  RoT since it can be demonstrated to behave in an expected manner in a significantly higher percentage of  attack scenarios.  Reliable and trustworthy BIOS integrity measurement and reporting depend upon Software Agents to  perform functions upon which a verifier must rely. Each Software Agent relies upon RoTs and the level  of trustworthiness in the Agent depends on its RoTs. The RoT for any Software Agent is the computing  engine either capable of reliably and accurately performing that Agent’s functions, or responsible for  reliably spawning Software Agents to perform the task. As such, an Agent may be implemented entirely  within the RoT or may be spawned by its RoT via a trusted chain anchored in the RoT. Therefore, the  trustworthiness of the Agent is dependent on its respective RoT and trust chain.  The highest-assurance mechanisms for BIOS integrity measurement provide mutable state tolerance,  where the mechanisms are able to provide reliable and trustworthy reports on the BIOS and its  configuration, irrespective of the overall machine configuration or the contents of the BIOS storage  device. In addition, the highest-assurance mechanisms for BIOS integrity measurement provide memory  disclosure tolerance, where measurements reported by the mechanisms must be provably fresh (i.e.,  recently taken, generally for a specific request) and not spoofed by any party, even with full knowledge of  all contents ever present in software-readable memory throughout all past software execution. Thus, such  mechanisms are more robust against exploits of software vulnerabilities, and are not affected by  disclosure of cryptographic keys present in software-readable memory.  BIOS INTEGRITY MEASUREMENT GUIDELINES (DRAFT)  12  3.1.1 Overview of Software Agents  BIM requires the coordination of a Measurement Agent to harvest measurements, a Storage Agent to  protect the measurements from modification until they can be reported, and a Reporting Agent to reliably  report the measurements. If the measurements are reported immediately after harvesting, there may not be  a need to use a Storage Agent. A comprehensive system for ensuring BIOS integrity will also include  some form of verification of the collected measurements, and correspondingly will utilize Verification  Agents that assess reported measurements. Such Verification Agents may be resident on the measured  endpoint, or may reside externally in the management services or infrastructure. In addition, if any  Software Agents can be modified or updated, then the trustworthiness of such Agents depends upon the  mechanism used to implement updates. Thus, if such updates are possible, the endpoint should include  Update Agents to effect software updates in a reliable manner providing protections equivalent to [NIST- SP800-147].  3.1.2 Overview of Roots of Trust  The RoT for Measurement (RTM) is a computing engine capable of making inherently reliable integrity  measurements. It is the root of the chain of transitive trust for subsequent Measurement Agents. A small  RTM applied very soon after a re-initialization of an endpoint may have greater value than an RTM  instantiated later, mainly in minimizing the attack surface’s exposure to subversion of the measurement  process. The later the endpoint invokes the RTM, the more opportunity an adversary has to subvert the  measurement trust chain. The larger the RTM, the greater the chance that a flaw in its implementation  will provide an opportunity for an adversary to subvert the RTM.  The RoT for Storage (RTS) is a computing engine capable of maintaining a tamper-evident summary of  integrity measurement values and the sequence of those measurements. It does not include the details of  the sequence of integrity measurements, but rather holds integrity hashes for those sequences. These  integrity hashes can either be used to verify the integrity of a log containing the integrity measurement  values and the sequence of those measurements, or it can be used as a proxy for that log. The RTS  maintains these integrity hashes in tamper-evident locations. For example, the interface may allow  register extensions (defined in Section 3.2.2.2) but disallow direct register writes. These authorized  interfaces are commonly called protected capabilities. Together the tamper-evident locations and  protected capabilities collectively form the RTS.  The RoT for Reporting (RTR) is a computing engine capable of reliably reporting information provided by  the RTM and its Measurement Agent(s) or held by the RTS. The RTR serves as the basis for the  capabilities of integrity and non-repudiation of reports of measurement data. It necessarily leverages the  RTM and RTS. A key requirement for the RTR is an unambiguous identity, both of the endpoint and the  components being measured and reported. This identity may be persistent or temporary. Signatures of  measurement report data using keys are a common mechanism to provide unambiguous identity.  Certificates for keys may certify membership in a group or identify a particular member.  3.1.3 Agent Coordination  The trustworthiness of the coordination of all of the relevant Agents in combination gives Verification  Agents the confidence to make a reliable assessment of the BIOS integrity of measured endpoints.  Evaluation of the trust properties afforded by the composed system is critical, and evaluation of an  individual Agent’s trust properties is only relevant in the context of the entire system.  Figure 2 illustrates that the RoTs must act in concert and build on each other to enable reliable and  trustworthy measurement, reporting, and verification of BIMs. In addition, these RoTs must properly  BIOS INTEGRITY MEASUREMENT GUIDELINES (DRAFT)  13  integrate with mechanisms for integrity protection and authentication for secure BIOS updates. The  implementation of these RoTs, and other endpoint security mechanisms, may be achieved in an integrated  fashion, where all are comprised within a single software component, such as the BIOS. Whether the  implementation is monolithic or disaggregated, the combination of these RoTs, and the combination of  the RoTs that they are built upon, forms the basis for the trustworthiness of the total BIM solution.  3.1.4 Security Guidelines for RoTs  1. The endpoint vendor SHALL provide the hardware support necessary to implement credible  RTMs, RTSs, and RTRs and use that support to implement corresponding RoTs for BIMs.  2. The endpoint vendor SHALL combine the mechanisms of the RTM, RTS, and RTR to form an  integrated, reliable foundation for BIMs.  3. The endpoint vendor SHOULD provide mechanisms for integrity-protected, non-bypassable  implementation of authenticated or secure BIOS updates, as necessary to conform to [NIST- SP800-147].  4. The endpoint vendor MAY provide hardware support for implementing a credible dynamic RTM  for post boot-time measurements. The endpoint vendor and OS vendor MAY use that support to  implement such an RoT for BIMs.  3.2 Integrity Attribute and Measurement Baselines  A key factor in a meaningful integrity measurement comparison scheme is establishing and maintaining,  with confidence, a known baseline of attributes and measurements with which one can make decisions.  The establishment of a baseline must take into account two scenarios: endpoint devices with a BIOS of  unknown or questionable provenance, and endpoint devices with a known and trusted (protected and  signed) BIOS. This section lists attributes and measurements for the baselines.  3.2.1 Overview of BIOS Integrity Attributes  Attributes are used for assessing confidence in BIOS integrity measurements. Endpoint vendors have  various ways to convey attributes to users. The endpoint vendor may present these attributes along with  golden BIOS measurements in a certificate to the user in an out-of-band channel (i.e., not delivered with  the endpoint itself, but through other means). The endpoint vendor may allow the user to query the  Verification Agent  Measurement Agent  Storage Agent  Reporting Agent  RTM RTS RTR RTV  Verification Agent MAA  Figure 2: Coordination of RoTs and Agents  BIOS INTEGRITY MEASUREMENT GUIDELINES (DRAFT)  14  endpoint and extract the attributes directly. Alternatively, the endpoint vendor may allow the user to  present a serial number to a managed online service, which then responds with a list of attributes for the  endpoint as it was delivered. Regardless of how the user obtains the attributes for a particular endpoint,  the reason for the attributes is to give the user a means of assessing the validity of the BIMs reported by  the endpoint and developing a level of confidence in the reports it receives about the overall health status  of the endpoint beyond only the BIMs.  3.2.1.1 List of BIOS Integrity Attributes  This section lists BIOS integrity attributes and suggests possible values for them.  1. RTM - The attribute of the RTM provides information about the amount of time/code available  to the adversary before measurement of the BIOS takes place, often referred to as the size of the  attack surface. The sooner an endpoint can leverage an RTM and take BIOS measurements, the  smaller the attack surface, and the more confidence an assessor can have in the measurements.  The later in time after initialization or re-initialization an endpoint leverage an RTM before taking  BIOS measurements, the larger the attack surface and the less confidence an assessor may have in  the measurements. Examples of the values for an attribute of an RTM include:  ● Class 1 (i.e., the endpoint instantiates the RTM as part of the early BIOS POST initialization)  ● Class 2 (i.e., the endpoint instantiates the RTM after the early BIOS POST initialization)  2. RTS - The attribute of the RTS provides information about the protections afforded for tamper- evident locations. The more likely an RTS is to rebuff attacks from an adversary, the more  confidence an assessor can have in the measurements it contains. The values for the RTS may  take on the following:  ● Class 1: Hardware-based (e.g., TPM 1.2, processor-based protected storage)  ● Class 2: Software-based (e.g., OS key store, System Management Random Access Memory  (SMRAM))  3. RTR - The attribute of the RTR provides information about the protections afforded to the data to  be reported, the keying material used to provide authentication, the code using the key for  signatures, and non-repudiation services. The more likely an RTR is to rebuff attacks from an  adversary, the more confidence an assessor can have in the reports. The values for an RTR  attribute may include:  ● Class 1: Hardware-based (e.g., TPM 1.2, processor-based)  ● Class 2: Software-based (e.g., OS, BIOS Boot Block + Key stored in BIOS)  4. BIOS Signature Present - This is an indication of whether or not the BIOS has been signed and  the signatures are present with the BIOS. Values include:  ● None (none of the BIOS is signed)  ● Partial (some of the BIOS components are signed and present)  ● Full (All BIOS components have been signed and the signatures are present)  5. BIOS Update Mechanisms - This attribute provides an indication of the type of BIOS update  mechanism employed by the vendor. The importance of this attribute lies in the diligence  exercised by the BIOS provider in providing the latest update of the BIOS code and data  provided. In the context of security, the presence of a reliable BIOS mechanism provides the end  user with assurance that the BIOS provider can safely remediate their products against threats  BIOS INTEGRITY MEASUREMENT GUIDELINES (DRAFT)  15  should the need arise. A BIOS with an unreliable or nonexistent update mechanism may be held  in suspicion. Values include:  ● None (it’s not possible to update the BIOS)  ● Capsule (from OS, write new BIOS to RAM, then perform a system reboot)  ● System Management Mode (SMM) (from OS, use SMM to modify the BIOS, then continue  without rebooting the system; reboot is necessary for realization of new BIOS)  ● Other  6. Virtualization - This attribute provides an indication of whether the BIOS originates from the  endpoint hardware or is provided as part of a virtual machine (VM). Values include:  ● None (physical BIOS present)  ● Full (virtual BIOS in play)  7. Flash Lockdown - This attribute provides an indication of the capability of the endpoint to  protect the flash where the BIOS resides from unauthorized modification. This term normally  refers to a hardware capability. The importance of this attribute lies in the diligence exercised by  the BIOS provider in providing protections against unauthorized modifications of the BIOS code  and data. In the context of security, the presence of reliable BIOS flash protection provides the  end user with confidence in the BIOS measurements. A BIOS with unreliable or nonexistent flash  protections may be held in suspicion. Values include:  ● None  ● Chipset  ● Native to flash chip  3.2.1.2 Security Guidelines for RoT Attributes  1. Endpoint vendors SHALL provide the attributes defined in Section 3.2.1.1.  2. Endpoint vendors SHALL provide reference measurements of executable BIOS boot code at the  lowest level of granularity for which they provide update and maintenance and that can be used to  verify measurements returned from the RTR.  3. Endpoint vendors SHALL provide a mechanism for measuring and reporting a baseline of  measurements for BIOS configuration data.  4. Endpoint vendors SHOULD deploy BIOS measurement and reporting mechanisms that do not  preclude extension to option ROMs external to the system BIOS.  5. Endpoint vendors SHOULD provide attributes in a standardized format.  6. Endpoint vendors MAY provide an indication of compliance with [NIST-SP800-147].  3.2.2 Overview of BIOS Integrity Measurements  This section defines the minimal essential BIMs all endpoints are to be capable of reporting. It addresses  the format of these measurements and how they are generated.  BIOS Boot Code Integrity Measurement - The BIOS boot code integrity measurement is either a  cryptographic hash of the BIOS boot code or an extended cryptographic hash of the BIOS boot code  modules. In either case, it can simply be referred to as “the hash”. The hash includes the following  BIOS INTEGRITY MEASUREMENT GUIDELINES (DRAFT)  16  components if implemented:  ● BIOS boot block  ● SMM code  ● Advanced Configuration and Power Interface (ACPI) code  ● Power On Self Test (POST) code  ● BIOS recovery mechanism code  ● BIOS update mechanism code  ● BBM software  ● RTM  ● Embedded Option ROMs (those Option ROMs embedded in the BIOS boot code and controlled  by the BIOS vendor)  BIOS Configuration Data Integrity Measurements - The BIOS configuration data integrity  measurement is either a cryptographic hash of the user configurable data components of the BIOS, or an  extended cryptographic hash of the individual configuration data components. All such BIOS  configuration data must be measured, with the exception of endpoint configuration information that is  automatically updated, such as clock registers, and system unique information, such as asset numbers or  serial numbers. These must not be measured into the same register. If measured, system unique  information, such as asset numbers, serial numbers, password hashes, etc. should be measured into a  different privacy register. This allows for a consistent measurement to be established both among  identical systems and between boot measurements of the same system, but also allows a system  administrator to determine if passwords have been changed.  In practice, live integrity measurements of BIOS components taken from various endpoints of the same  make and model produce distinct and unique values. This seems counterintuitive, especially for integrity  measurements of static BIOS components. The absence of golden BIOS measurements makes further  investigation problematic, especially in distinguishing between compromised and authentic BIOSes.  In practice, RoTs maintain composites of BIMs. Although specifications recommend how individual  integrity measurements should be stored and preserved, the lack of standardization makes interpretation  of these measurements for forensics problematic.  3.2.2.1 BIOS Integrity Measurement Generation and Storage  In order to monitor and improve BIOS integrity, BIOS integrity measurements must start being securely  generated and stored. These measurements can then be transmitted, analyzed, reported on, and used to  provide remediation. This section describes how endpoints generate and store BIMs.  The endpoint RTM must serve as the anchor for the chain of trust for measurement. The endpoint forms a  chain of trust for measurement by having the endpoint RTM measure one or more binary components and  recording those measurement(s) in a safe place before the binary component(s) executes. In turn, the  endpoint maintains the chain of trust for measurement by delegating measurement to only those  components measured either by the endpoint RTM or by some other component whose measurement can  be traced back to the endpoint RTM. The chain of trust for measurement should measure all BIOS  configuration data (non-executable binaries) prior to the endpoint consuming it.  BIOS INTEGRITY MEASUREMENT GUIDELINES (DRAFT)  17  3.2.2.2 BIOS Integrity Measurement Registers  For clarity, this document creates and uses a number of “register” types. The term register is meant to  explain the various types of storage capabilities needed and how they are used, not to define any  particular implementation architecture or naming convention.  As the trust chain for measurement measures BIOS code and data, the endpoint must store the  measurements in a trusted place that would accommodate later monitoring and inspection should the  administrator of the endpoint desire it. The endpoint RTM and the chain of trust for measurement store  the measurements in Integrity Measurement Registers (IMRs) contained in the RTS. They will hash BIOS  components (code and data) using an approved cryptographic hash algorithm such as one of those  published in [NIST-FIPS180-3]. The IMRs should be of sufficient length to accommodate the entire  result of the hash chosen from the approved list.  BIOS integrity measurement implementers SHALL initialize each IMR to a known fixed value. They  may hash all the BIOS components intended for a register together at once and extend the result in a  BIOS IMR. Alternatively, implementers may create a composite of hashes by serially hashing BIOS  components one at a time and extending the BIOS code IMR in the following way for each component:  IMRnew = H(IMRold||H(BIOScomponent))  IMRnew is the new IMR  IMRold is the old value of the IMR  BIOScomponent is the BIOS component to be measured  H is a hash algorithm from the approved list  || is the concatenation operator  It is OPTIONAL to use a keyed hash algorithm, such as HMAC, when measuring BIOS components. A  randomized hash algorithm MAY be applied for additional collision resistance, such as the one published  in [NIST-SP800-106]. In that case, the size of the IMRs MUST accommodate the output of the  randomized hash algorithms, along with the additional parameters necessary to verify the hashes.  The endpoint SHALL initialize the IMRs to a known fixed value before measurement of any BIOS  component takes place. Ideally, power-on of the endpoint initializes these registers. Only an endpoint  reset which causes the BIOS to fully execute SHOULD cause the reset of these registers. An endpoint  recovering from the invocation of suspension (commonly called sleep and hibernation modes) will not  initialize IMRs, but rather restore valid values saved during the suspension process.  The endpoint accumulates all measurements of BIOS executable components together into one IMR.  Likewise, the endpoint performs the same process for all measurements of BIOS configuration data  components, with the exception of privacy sensitive data, such as passwords, serial numbers, asset  numbers, keying material, etc. and elements such as time which make golden measurements impossible.  These excluded items tend to be unique to platforms and could cause platforms that administrators have  configured identically to project different configuration data IMRs. Also, since these items are privacy  sensitive, administrators may want the option to configure the measurement and reporting of these values.  The endpoint SHALL accumulate BIOS executable code measurements in the BIOS code integrity  measurement register (CIMR), SHALL accumulate BIOS data measurements in the BIOS data integrity  measurement register (DIMR), and SHOULD accumulate BIOS privacy sensitive data in the BIOS  privacy integrity measurement register (PIMR).  BIOS INTEGRITY MEASUREMENT GUIDELINES (DRAFT)  18  3.2.2.3 BIOS Measurement Log  In addition to extending BIOS code and data measurements into the CIMR and DIMR, respectively,  BIOS functions MAY also extend optional measurements and events into them. To aid in disentangling  the measurements placed in the register, an administrator would find great value in a log that describes the  measurements and events extended into them. Several examples include:  ● The endpoint vendor maintains and updates BIOS code in modules, and programs the BIOS code  to measure and extend the CIMR on a module by module basis. A log would help an MAA detect  the cases in which one or more bad or unanticipated measurements were extended into the CIMR.  ● If the endpoint contains more than one BIOS image, e.g. an operational and a backup, an  administrator may want to gain additional details about which copy was measured and extended  into the CIMR. An early stage BIOS function may extend an “event” into the CIMR that signals  the choice taken, along with a corresponding entry in the log.  ● The BIOS may want to “cap” measurement extensions just before handing off execution to a  post-boot environment. By extending a “cap” event into the CIMR or DIMR and recording a  corresponding event in the log, an administrator can detect which events occurred during which  phase of the endpoint initialization.  ● BIOS configuration data has many permutations. An event log recording measurements and  events involving BIOS configuration data, if formatted appropriately, could aid in a  programmatic review for unanticipated changes.  A stored measurement log (SML) allows higher endpoint agents, such as the Reporting and Collection  Agents, to gather them for preprocessing and correlation before forwarding to an MAA. Since these  agents typically run in a post-boot environment, the BIOS SHOULD take care in preserving the contents  of the SML during the handoff to a new environment.  SML measurements typically have better granularity than CIMR or DIMR values, but do not have the  finest granularity of containing the raw BIOS firmware or configuration data. While a system SHALL  have SML data available for reporting, it SHOULD provide a means to programmatically report and  interpret the BIOS configuration data. The TCG provides a standard format for SML log entries in [TCG- ConvBiosSpec].  3.2.2.4 Security Guidelines for BIOS Integrity Measurement Generation and Storage  1. Measured Components  a. The endpoint SHALL measure all BIOS executable components.  b. The endpoint SHALL measure all BIOS configuration data components, with the exception  of privacy sensitive data.  c. The endpoint SHOULD measure privacy sensitive data separate from other BIOS  configuration data components.  2. BIOS Measurement Generation and Storage  a. The endpoint SHALL support boot-time measurement.  b. The endpoint SHALL use an RTM or a component in the chain of trust for measurement  rooted in an RTM to generate BIOS integrity measurements.  BIOS INTEGRITY MEASUREMENT GUIDELINES (DRAFT)  19  c. The endpoint SHALL use approved standard cryptographic techniques to generate BIOS  integrity measurements.  d. The endpoint SHALL use standard BIOS integrity measurements formats.  e. The format and reporting of BIMs – both golden measurements and endpoint measurements –  SHALL use open standards or specifications, such as [TCG-Manifest] and [TCG-Integrity].  f. The endpoint vendor SHOULD use an extensible system to enable adding support for  measuring option ROMs, etc.  g. The endpoint SHALL store BIMs in an RTS.  h. The endpoint vendor SHOULD make raw BIOS configuration data available for reporting  and SHOULD have a means of interpretation of that data available.  3. Measurement Log  a. BIOS functions SHALL record in an SML measurement and event extensions into the CIMR  and DIMR.  b. BIOS functions SHOULD record in an SML measurement and event extensions into the  PIMR.  c. BIOS functions SHALL use a standardized format, such as [TCG-ConvBiosSpec], when  recording BIM and other BIOS-related events in an SML.  d. BIOS SHALL ensure the proper handoff of the SML to the post-boot environment.  4. Measurement Support  a. The OS vendor SHALL support a standard application programming interface (API) for  collecting measurements.  b. The endpoint, OS, and application vendors SHALL support an RTR for collecting and  reporting BIMs.  3.2.2.5 Relevant Standards and Specifications  There are several standards of note related to these requirements. The [NIST-SP800-147] specification  spells out the necessary conditions for achieving and maintaining an immutable BIOS boot block upon  which an RTM depends. The [TCG-ConvBiosSpec] specification defines for which BIOS components the  RTM (i.e., BIOS) should take measurements and store them in the RTS (e.g., TPM). The TCG EFI  Platform Specification Version 1.20 Revision 1.0 [TCG-EFI] specifies the Extensible Firmware Interface  (EFI) components that the RTM, or by extension the chain of trust within the EFI, should measure and  store in the RTS (e.g., TPM). Finally, the TCG Infrastructure Working Group Reference Manifest  Schema Specification Version 1.0 [TCG-Manifest] specifies the format which vendors can use to report  BIOS integrity golden measurements, endpoint measurements, and BIOS integrity measurement  attributes.  3.3 BIOS Integrity Reporting  Reporting of the BIOS integrity values stored in the RTS is performed by an Endpoint Reporting Agent.  3.3.1 Endpoint Reporting Agent  The endpoint RTR and the Reporting Agent anchored in the RTR are responsible for extracting the  measurements stored in the IMRs of the RTS. It is critical that the RTR and the Reporting Agent apply  BIOS INTEGRITY MEASUREMENT GUIDELINES (DRAFT)  20  integrity and non-repudiation protections on the data so that subsequent agents cannot alter or replace the  data without detection by the MAA. In addition, unambiguous identity is an important property to apply  to the data so that the MAA knows the source of the data. Typically a signature over the data using a key  recognized by the MAA is sufficient to satisfy the integrity, non-repudiation, and unambiguous identity  goals.  In addition the Reporting Agent is responsible for supplying the SML corresponding to the IMR data. It is  desirable to identify the components measured based on a component ID that uniquely identifies the  manufacturer, model, and version, thus allowing the MAA to compare the measurements against its  golden measurements.  The endpoint Reporting Agent is given a nonce which originates in the MAA and is passed to it through  the Transmission Agent and Collection Agent. It then passes this nonce to the RTR and receives back a  signature over the nonce together with the hash representation of the measurements stored in the RTS. It  also obtains the SML and puts the two together in a standard format. This report must eventually be  readable by an MAA. Therefore  1. The defined report format SHALL use [TCG-Integrity].  2. The report SHOULD contain a copy of the BIOS configuration, in an industry standard format, if  the ability to parse and determine the acceptability of the configuration is desired.  In addition to the above guidance and the standards listed throughout Section 3.3, the requirements below  in Section 3.3.2 apply to the BIOS measurement reports that are provided to the Verification Agent in the  MAA.  3.3.2 Security Guidelines for the Reporting Protocol  1. BIOS reporting mechanisms MAY prepare and issue a BIOS integrity report to an authenticated  MAA upon any of the following conditions:  a. When a change was made to the BIOS configuration  b. When a change was made to the BIOS software  c. When a local port was used to access the BIOS or its configuration  d. When a BIOS error condition has been generated  e. Upon connection to a network controlled by an authenticated MAA.  2. BIOS reporting mechanisms MAY support the ability to configure specific events to trigger  reports of BIOS integrity measurements.  3. Report requests MAY be initiated by either the reporter or the receiver of the report. The  following requirements apply to requests that are initiated by either side:  a. Mechanisms SHALL be capable of providing provably fresh BIOS reports that are sent to the  MAA.  b. The report SHOULD include a reference to the formatting standard/schema used for the  report.  c. The report format SHOULD include a version field that can be updated over time as the  report format gets extended or otherwise changes.  d. All requests to issue or provide a report from an unauthenticated entity SHOULD be ignored.  BIOS INTEGRITY MEASUREMENT GUIDELINES (DRAFT)  21  e. Requests to provide or issue a report MAY contain a priority that indicates the urgency of the  request.  f. Response timeframes related to requests MAY be configurable by the licensed user based on  priority.  3.3.3 Relevant Standards and Specifications  BIOS measurements need to be provided in a standard schema so that they can be used and acted upon by  the receiving entity based on policy. Therefore, the following standards and guidance should be employed  for establishing a trust model for reporting and for providing standard reporting formats and transport for  BIOS measurements.  The TCG Infrastructure Working Group Integrity Report Schema Specification [TCG-Integrity] defines  the structure with which integrity information is communicated between entities. The TCG Trusted  Network Connect (TNC) Working Group IF-M Specification [TCG-IF-M] defines a protocol for an MAA  to request measurements from an endpoint, and for the endpoint to provide those measurements to the  MAA.  The TCG Trusted Network Connect Architecture for Interoperability specification [TCG-ARCH-INTER]  describes an open solution architecture that enables network operators to enforce policies regarding the  security state of endpoints in order to determine whether to grant access to a requested network  infrastructure. Endpoint integrity policies may involve integrity parameters spanning a range of system  components (hardware, firmware, software, and application settings), and may or may not include  evidence of a TPM. This security assessment of each endpoint is performed using a set of asserted  integrity measurements covering aspects of the operational environment of the endpoint. IF-M, IF- TNCCS, and IF-T are key TNC protocols for transmitting measurements from an endpoint to an MAA.  NIST IR 7802 [NIST-IR-7802] provides recommendations on how to use existing specifications to  represent signatures, hashes, key information, and identity information in the context of an XML  document within the security automation domain. NIST IR 7694 [NIST-IR-7694] describes the Asset  Reporting Format (ARF), a data model for expressing the transport format of information about assets  and the relationships between assets and reports. The standardized data model facilitates the reporting,  correlating, and fusing of asset information throughout and between organizations. NIST SP 800-126  [NIST-SP800-126] defines the Security Content Automation Protocol (SCAP), a suite of specifications  that standardize the format and nomenclature by which security software products communicate security  content, particularly software flaw and security configuration information. SCAP is a multi-purpose  protocol that supports automated configuration, vulnerability, and patch checking, technical control  compliance activities, and security measurement.  The DMTF’s System Management BIOS (SMBIOS) Reference Specification [DMTF-SMBIOS]  addresses how motherboard and system vendors present management information about their products in  a standard format by extending the BIOS interface on x86 architecture systems. This specification is  intended to provide enough information that BIOS developers may implement the necessary extensions to  allow the hardware on their products and other system-related information to be accurately determined by  users of the defined interfaces. In addition, in cases where the implementer has provided write access to  non-volatile storage on the system, some information may be updated by management applications after a  system is deployed in the field to record data that persists between system starts. The specification is also  intended to provide enough information for developers of management instrumentation to develop generic  routines for translating from SMBIOS format to the format used by their chosen management technology,  whether it is a DMTF technology like DMI or CIM, or another technology. To support this translation for  DMTF technologies, sections of this specification describe the DMI groups and CIM classes intended to  BIOS INTEGRITY MEASUREMENT GUIDELINES (DRAFT)  22  convey the information retrieved from an SMBIOS-compatible system through the interfaces described in  the document.  Finally, the TCG Attestation PTS Protocol: Binding to TNC IF-M specification [TCG-Att-PTS] and the  TCG Infrastructure Working Group Integrity Report Schema Specification [TCG-Integrity] define how to  use IF to request and send Integrity Reports. They also adds the means to send the random nonce and  support TLV-based integrity report data.  3.4 BIOS Integrity Measurement Collection and Transmission  3.4.1 Overview of Measurement Collection and Transmission  BIMs are collected and placed in a standard format by the Collection Agent, then transmitted from the  endpoint to the MAA by a Transmission Agent. This section describes the requirements that must be met  by the Collection Agent and Transmission Agent.  Secure transmission of BIMs ensures that measurements are not modified, disclosed, or forged in transit  by malicious parties. Further, proper selection of transmission protocols should ensure maximum  interoperability, freshness, and efficiency. In addition, cryptographic protection of the integrity and source  authentication of measurements starting at the RTR ensures that even if the Collection Agent,  Transmission Agent, or other software becomes compromised, the measurements cannot be falsified.  3.4.2 Security Guidelines for Measurement Collection and Transmission  The Transmission Agent SHALL securely transmit measurements of BIOS integrity from endpoints to the  MAA, as follows:  1. All reporting sessions SHALL:  a. have the ability to provide confidentiality protection.  b. provide integrity protection and freshness.  c. authenticate the MAA.  d. provide authentication of endpoint identities.  2. The Transmission Agent:  a. SHALL permit measurements to be integrity protected all the way from the RTR to the  verifying component.  b. SHOULD support a variety of different services such as continuous monitoring, network  access control, and application-layer integrity monitoring  c. SHOULD ensure the resulting system is inexpensive, unobtrusive, high performance, and  secure (although higher levels of security may require higher levels of cost)  3. Collection Agents and Transmission Agents on endpoints SHOULD support open standards that  enable interoperability among many different kinds of endpoints and MAAs over many different  forms of communications media, to the extent that such standards are available.  3.4.3 Relevant Standards and Specifications  There are several standards relevant to the above requirements. The PA-TNC specification [IETF-RFC- 5792] is equivalent to TCG's IF-M 1.0 [TCG-IF-M]; it describes a standard structure for requesting and  BIOS INTEGRITY MEASUREMENT GUIDELINES (DRAFT)  23  transmitting integrity measurements. The PB-TNC specification [IETF-RFC-5793] is equivalent to TCG's  IF-TNCCS 2.0. It describes a standard protocol for conducting an integrity measurement exchange. The  TCG Trusted Network Connect TNC IF-T: Binding to TLS specification [TCG-IF-T-TLS] describes how  an integrity measurement exchange is transmitted over the TLS protocol, after network connectivity has  been established. The TCG Trusted Network Connect TNC IF-T: Protocol Bindings for Tunneled EAP  Methods specification [TCG-IF-T-EAP] describes how an integrity measurement exchange is transmitted  over EAP, before network connectivity has been established. Finally, the TCG Attestation PTS Protocol:  Binding to TNC IF-M specification [TCG-Att-PTS] defines how to use IF to request and send Integrity  Reports. It also adds the means to send the random nonce and support TLV-based integrity report data.  3.5 Measurement Assessment Authority  3.5.1 Overview  The MAA is responsible for several things. It transmits a nonce to the client Transmission Agent to  guarantee it will receive fresh measurements back from the client. It receives the transmission from the  client Transmission Agent in response, which will consist of a report detailing the BIMs together with a  signature over the nonce and a set of hashes which together prove the integrity of that report.  When these items are reliably and robustly reported, it allows an enterprise management system to  accurately determine the state of the security relevant BIOS configuration items on the system. With this  information, the MAA can report on and act upon the specific configuration items with which the  organization is concerned. It is not forced to act only upon the fact that a change in some unspecified  configuration item has caused the overall measurement to deviate from its last recorded value, when the  configuration item that changed may not even be security relevant. It should be possible for the  administrative component of the BIOS reporting mechanism to select which attributes are reported. For  individual BIOS configuration items, a security administrator can be expected to provide the desired  values for items which are of concern to the organization.  Collected and reported BIOS measurements can be used to make an access decision, either through  quarantine, denial of access to network resources or remediation. It also provides situational awareness of  one aspect of a network’s security posture based on the integrity of the devices on the network. The  adoption of TCG-compliant BIOS by endpoint vendors will provide some of the necessary infrastructure  to reliably establish, measure, and report the state of the BIOS on endpoints. At a minimum, the MAA has  to be able to provide the state of the system either for display to an IT administrator or to an automated  access/enforcement point. Information collected may be reported to a policy enforcement/decision point  for some form of remediation or response, or may be fed to visualization capabilities that provide a  network operator or analyst with an aggregated and normalized view of the integrity of the assets on a  network. Visualization/situational awareness capabilities exist today that collect other device  measurements; the addition of BIOS integrity measurements is a natural and straightforward extension.  The BIOS may be subject to bit rot, or modifications where the bits of the BIOS contents may change  spuriously as a result of random faults as determined by the physical properties of the BIOS storage  device hardware. Depending on the BIOS storage device hardware, those spurious modifications may  happen with some frequency in very large installations; as a result, unexpected BIOS measurements may  be reported potentially weekly or daily. To avoid the assumption that all unexpected measurements are  due to bit rot, and to facilitate correct decisions and appropriate actions by operators, the MAA MAY  provide mechanisms that allow assessing whether measurement results are likely due to bit rot.  BIOS INTEGRITY MEASUREMENT GUIDELINES (DRAFT)  24  3.5.2 Security Guidelines for the MAA  1. The MAA SHALL be capable of storing expected values (golden measurements).  2. The MAA SHALL be capable of comparing new reported values against expected values and/or  previously reported (last known) measurements.  3. The MAA SHALL be capable of storing reported values.  4. MAAs SHALL support open standards that enable interoperability among many different kinds  of endpoints and MAAs over many different forms of communications media, to the extent that  such standards are available.  5. The MAA MAY be capable of providing an assessment of the likelihood that an unexpected,  anomalous measurement is the result of a bit rot, if provided with the contents of the BIOS that  generated the anomalous measurement as well as the BIOS contents for which golden  measurements exist.  3.6 Remediation Activities  Remediation is the process of correcting a problem with a computing system. In the context of BIOS  security, remediation refers to actions such as upgrading an outdated BIOS to a known-good version and  reconfiguring a BIOS to meet an organization’s security requirements. There are often several options for  the processes used to remediate a BIOS security problem. The appropriate process option or options for  each case may vary according to several factors, including the type of problem (BIOS update,  configuration change, etc.), the nature of the problem (intentional attack versus accidental change), the  relative importance of the system, and the organization’s incident handling policies and practices. Each  organization needs to determine which factors are relevant for their environment and determine how to  incorporate them into remediation activities. Further discussion of this is outside the scope of this  publication.  The remediation discussion in this section does not take into account incident handling and forensic  activities, which are outside the scope of this publication. See NIST SP 800-61 for additional information  on incident handling and NIST SP 800-86 for general forensic guidelines.  3.6.1 Quarantine Strategies  Quarantine is the process of virtually “moving” a compromised system from a position of broad network  and resource access (or potential access, in the case of a system being joined to a network) to a pool of  networked systems whose access is restricted, so that the target system can “do no harm” before  remediation is completed. Full quarantine restricts all network access, while partial quarantine allows the  system to access some parts of the network, but not more sensitive regions.  Quarantine is intended to be a short-term state. If mitigation is successful, typically the quarantine ends  and the system is allowed its regular network access. If mitigation is not successful, it may be appropriate  to completely remove the system from service so that an administrator can manually handle the  mitigation.  BIM-supporting products can leverage existing standards to support quarantining. The TCG Trusted  Network Connect IF-PEP [TCG-IF-PEP] can be used to send commands between the MAA and the  enforcement point to support full or partial quarantining. RFC 3576, Dynamic Authorization Extensions  to Remote Authentication Dial In User Service [IETF-RFC-3576], can be used to support dynamic  BIOS INTEGRITY MEASUREMENT GUIDELINES (DRAFT)  25  authorization, allowing an MAA and enforcement point to retest an endpoint at a later time and  potentially take remedial action, including quarantining the system.  3.6.2 Remediation Automation  Organizations may have several options for partially or fully automating their BIOS remediation actions.  Different options are appropriate for different situations and environments. For example, one organization  may want their BIOS remediation to be completely driven by external systems (e.g., enterprise network  and system management), while another organization may want remediation to be completely self- contained in the product, and to have remediation actions performed as soon as possible using fully  automated means. There are many approaches between these extremes, with most manufacturers shipping  their products with a default automated remediation strategy. Possible strategies include the following:  1. Fully automated, self-contained. In the case of some systems, there may be specialized trusted  hardware out of band to the normal system that can provide full remediation to the system in the  event of a compromise.  2. Fully automated, externally driven. Most enterprises and large organizations will employ server- based remediation on systems that will allow remote remediation to fix problems. Full reboot will  likely be necessary in this case as software by itself is generally not trustable.  3. Partially automated requiring physical operator intervention. For example, if remediation  software is compromised, it may be necessary to reboot the system from a secondary source, such  as a CD, to employ trusted remediation client software. In any event, the system’s operator can be  trusted to be involved in the remediation, rather than requiring a trusted IT representative to do it.  4. Partially automated requiring remote owner intervention. In this case an IT representative may  have to be dispatched to work on the system rather than its operator.  Products may implement stages of remediation, which include fallback strategies, in the event that initial  remediations are unsuccessful. Each stage may be fully automated, may be customer configurable, or may  allow for manual intervention. Ordering of remediation stages may similarly be automated or customer  configurable. In staged linear remediation, there is a single path of predetermined remediation paths; in  staged branching remediation, there is a flexible set of remediation path choice points, based on one or  more variable inputs. An example of this would be a server-based remediation that a reboot shows was  not successful due to a compromise of the client-based remediation software. At this point, the client can  be rebooted to a preboot execution environment (PXE) server, which can then be used to run known-good  client-based remediation software, or a technician can be dispatched to the system to remediate it locally.  The PA-TNC specification [IETF-RFC-5792], equivalent to TCG's IF-M 1.0 [TCG-IF-M], can support  partially automated remediation that requires physical user intervention on the client. These standards  support sending Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs), such as a web address, or human readable strings  from the MAA to the endpoint, to assist the user-driven remediation activity.  The NIST SCAP specifications can also support fully or partially automated remediation activities. Draft  NISTIR 7670, Proposed Open Specifications for Enterprise Security Remediation [NIST-IR-7670],  examines use cases for enterprise remediation, identifies high-level requirements for these use cases, and  proposes a set of emerging specifications that address those requirements.  BIOS INTEGRITY MEASUREMENT GUIDELINES (DRAFT)  26  3.6.3 Restoration Options  There are several possible options for restoring the BIOS software or configuration to a “known good  state”, including the following:  1. Restoration to manufacturer default configuration  2. Restoration to customer default configuration for general use  3. Restoration to customer default operational configuration for a specific use  4. Restoration to last known good configuration  5. Force the system into a non-operational state (e.g., quarantined, removed from service)  Another consideration for restoration is the policy for handling a system’s non-volatile data. Possible  options include:  1. No backup  2. Partial backup  3. Full backup  4. Application gating strategy – This strategy can be applied when the compromise is localized to a  particular BIOS service that can be selectively disabled.  5. In the event that a particular service (such as a low-level manageability interface) has been  compromised, it may be possible to securely turn off the service rather than re-flash the entire  BIOS.  3.6.4 Verification Options  After a BIOS has been remediated, an organization may choose to verify its integrity. This usually  involves rebooting the system and putting it through its normal test sequence, ensuring that its integrity is  restored before giving the system access to network resources. Alternately, an organization may choose to  allow systems to return to operation without going through a standard retest. In this case the remediation  strategy is trusted at least as much as the trusted measurement that normally takes place upon boot.

BIOS INTEGRITY MEASUREMENT GUIDELINES (DRAFT)  31  Appendix B—Glossary and Abbreviations  This portion of the appendix defines terms used in this document.  Attribute: A property of RoTs used by an assessor to determine how much trust to place in them.  BIOS Code Integrity Measurement Register (CIMR): A register that contains either the cryptographic  hash of all the static BIOS code on the endpoint or a composite of hashes of all the BIOS components that  make up the BIOS code space.  BIOS Data Integrity Measurement Register (DIMR): A register that contains either the cryptographic  hash of all the dynamic BIOS configuration data on the endpoint or a composite of hashes of all the BIOS  components that make up the BIOS configuration data space.  BIOS Privacy Integrity Measurement Register (PIMR): A register that contains a composite of hashes  of all BIOS privacy sensitive data.  BIOS integrity measurement generation: The act of creating hashes of BIOS components and filling  static and dynamic BIOS configuration registers with those hashes.  Bit rot: Modifications to BIOS storage caused by random physical processes.  Collection: Both the act of measuring the BIOS integrity of an endpoint and the process of gathering the  resulting measurements so that they can be transmitted from the endpoint.  Dynamic BIOS Components: Those portions of the BIOS which the user may change without assistance  from either the BIOS vendor or the system vendor. This is often referred to as BIOS configuration data.  Endpoint: A system whose BIOS integrity is being measured. An endpoint can be a laptop, a server, a  virtualized environment, a service, etc.  Golden measurements: A trusted set of integrity measurements for a BIOS and its configuration data.  These measurements are usually provided from a trusted party, such as the OEM of the endpoint, or they  are taken by system administrators during the initial provisioning of a device. The SHA-2 hash of BIOS  signed by an OEM would be an example of a golden BIOS measurement. A golden BIOS measurement  does not confer information regarding the presence or absence of malicious properties. It does aid in the  quick, authentic, non-reputable identification of an object.  Integrity measurement: A compact representation of a binary code and/or data. In the context of BIOS  integrity measurement, this is typically represented as a cryptographic hash of binary code and data, often  cryptographically signed to preserve authenticity and non-repudiation.  Known-good state: When the BIOS has been verified as being in an acceptable state. An example of this  state is when a digital signature of the loaded BIOS verifies as matching the manufacturer’s current  version.  Measurement Assessment Authority (MAA): An agent running on behalf of IT management which  receives measurements from clients, checks the signature of those measurements, assesses the quality of  the measurements by comparing them with golden measurements, may further analyze measurements (to  determine what changes have been made to BIOS integrity measurements if the measurements do not  match golden measurements), and then either displays the results to IT management or acts as a proxy for  IT management to automatically take preset action when the measurements are not expected values.  Management controller: In a server environment, there is often a supervisory processor or controller that  “manages” the primary processors running applications. This management controller is separate from the  primary processors and can perform various operations on them or on their behalf.  BIOS INTEGRITY MEASUREMENT GUIDELINES (DRAFT)  32  Primary processor: One of possibly several processors (cores) that is available to run applications on a  system.  Remediation: The process of correcting a problem with a computing system.  Root of Trust (RoT): A component (software, hardware, or hybrid) and a computing engine that  constitute a set of unconditionally trusted functions. An RoT must always behave in an expected manner  because its misbehavior cannot be detected.  Root of Trust for Measurement (RTM): A computing engine capable of making inherently reliable  integrity measurements. The RTM is the root of the chain of transitive trust for subsequent measurement  agents.  Root of Trust for Reporting (RTR): A computing engine capable of reliably reporting information  provided by the RTM and its measurement agent(s) or held by the RTS.  Root of Trust for Storage (RTS): A computing engine capable of maintaining a tamper-evident  summary of integrity measurement values and the sequence of those measurements.  Static BIOS components – Those portions of the BIOS which the user may change, usually with  assistance either from the BIOS vendor or the system vendor. This is often referred to as BIOS code.  Historically, this code contained few protections against change. [NIST-SP800-147] outlines BIOS  protections that vendors could deploy.

BIOS INTEGRITY MEASUREMENT GUIDELINES (DRAFT)  36  Appendix D—Options for Implementing Roots of Trust  The basis of BIOS integrity guarantees are RoTs that are founded on the properties of one or more  hardware mechanisms. Some of these RoT themselves assume that the requirements and  recommendations in [NIST-SP800-147] are met. Some of the most relevant hardware mechanisms for  RoTs are enumerated below. (This list is not comprehensive.)  D.1 Startup Logic of the CPU and Chipset  BIOS integrity depends on the behavior of the CPU being well defined at startup, and in particular on the  chipset correctly mapping the BIOS storage device and the CPU executing the correct initial BIOS  instruction, as expected, after a reset. This hardware mechanism is the basis for boot-time RTMs, but may  be less relevant for RTMs based on “late-launch” mechanisms or runtime re-initialization of the CPU.  D.2 UEFI Power-On SEC Security Phase  The Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI) provides a supplement and partial replacement for  functions previously entirely handled by BIOS. The UEFI Power-on SEC security phase may provide an  RoT that may be able to reliably invoke software measurement agents in the UEFI in a way that can be  used to implement an RTM for BIOS integrity. This may require compliance with [NIST-SP800-147].  D.3 Access-Controlled Regions of the BIOS Storage Device  The integrity of the BIOS and of BIOS measurements may be based on hardware access control  mechanisms for the BIOS storage device itself. Such access control can be enforced through set-until- reboot latches that prevent reads or writes to the BIOS storage device. Such latches remain set until the  next hardware reset and can be locked down, for example, by the BIOS itself, during early stages of the  boot. The latches may be implemented, for example, through hardware mechanisms in either the BIOS  storage device itself or in the CPU chipset. These mechanisms may be used to form the basis of  compliance with [NIST-SP800-147].  Access-controlled regions of the BIOS storage device supported by [NIST-SP800-147] compliant  architectures can also serve as a basis for RTSs or RTRs. For example, the BIOS may measure itself  during initialization and place the measurement results in a readable, but write-protected-until-hardware- reset BIOS storage region. The BIOS can also create reports using a cryptographic key stored within a  region of the BIOS storage that is subsequently rendered inaccessible until the next hardware reset, before  the BIOS passes control to the OS or boot loader. To guarantee freshness, reports can make use of nonces  stored in volatile areas of the BIOS during the previous OS execution.  D.3.1 Static Immutable BIOS Boot Block  A static immutable BIOS Boot Block (or Initial BIOS code region) can serve a basis for BIOS integrity  RTMs, e.g., by measuring the contents of the relevant BIOS storage device and by setting its access- control latches. By being built on an immutable BIOS boot block, such an RTM could possibly provide  Mutable State Tolerance, as defined in Section 3.1 even without complying with [NIST-SP800-147].  D.4 Isolated CPU Execution Modes and Access-Controlled Memory  Several CPU execution modes and memory access-control features may form RoTs for BIOS integrity  and for BIOS measurements. By their nature, these implementations cannot provide Memory Disclosure  Tolerance, as defined in Section 3.1.  BIOS INTEGRITY MEASUREMENT GUIDELINES (DRAFT)  37  With a [NIST-SP800-147] architecture, the SMM execution mode of the CPU is a potential RoT that can  be the basis for isolated, stateful mechanisms that are controlled and initialized by the BIOS at boot time,  but are available during the machine's entire execution, until the next reboot. In some cases, SMM code  can have greater access to the BIOS storage device than the OS kernel. SMM mode on its own is not a  basis for RTMs. However, SMM mode can build on a BIOS-based RTM and serve to (a) perform runtime  measurements of the contents and the relevant access-control latch settings of the BIOS storage device,  (b) implement an RTS by placing measurement results in SMRAM, or (c) implement an RTR, for  example by having the BIOS initialize SMRAM with a private cryptographic key, used to sign  measurement reports, and which is accessible nowhere else but from SMM mode after BIOS initialization  has finished.  As outlined in the TCG specifications, some CPUs provide support for so-called dynamic RoTs, where  the CPU is reinitialized into a known-good state. In combination with a TPM, such “late-launch” CPU  execution modes can be the basis for all necessary RoTs. However, notably, such dynamic measurement  may not be able to establish the integrity of the BIOS or BIOS settings at past or future hardware resets;  to establish such boot-time guarantees, BIOS integrity MUST be protected using mechanisms such as  outlined in [NIST-SP800-147].  D.5 Supervisor CPU Execution Modes and Supervisor-Only Memory  A traditional role of privileged, kernel-mode code in hypervisors or operating systems is protection of  system devices, such as the BIOS. A hypervisor or an OS kernel is nearly always protected through  hardware-supported memory mechanisms, and the kernel runs in a supervisor execution mode with its  own private memory. In principle, those hardware mechanisms can be the RoT for implementing BIOS  integrity RTMs, RTSs, and RTRs, with the hypervisor or OS protecting its own integrity, that of the  BIOS, and that of reported measurements, particularly assuming a [NIST-SP800-147] architecture. Due to  their size and complexity, such hypervisor or OS-supported RoTs are likely to provide few guarantees,  and minimal assurance, at least for standard hypervisors or OSs.  D.6 Trusted Platform Modules  TPMs can serve as a basis for RTSs and RTRs. When combined with static immutable BIOS boot blocks  (as dictated by the TCG specifications, and as in Section D.3), TPMs can provide for both Mutable State  Tolerance and Memory Disclosure Tolerance, as defined in Section 3.1.  D.7 Proprietary RoTs  BIOS integrity protection and measurement mechanisms can be implemented by custom logic in the  CPU, CPU chipsets, and/or the BIOS storage device. Such custom logic may be used to implement any  RoTs, although few (if any) such implementations are currently available for commodity client hardware  platforms.  Examples of such RoTs might include BIOS storage devices that are either packaged with or closely  communicate with an embedded, separate microcontroller that is provisioned with a private key and  private storage. If properly implemented, such an RoT can be used to implement mechanisms that provide  Mutable State Tolerance and Memory Disclosure Tolerance, as defined in Section 3.1.  BIOS INTEGRITY MEASUREMENT GUIDELINES (DRAFT)  38  Appendix E—Example Implementation Possibilities  Appendix E enumerates some possibilities for the implementation of BIOS integrity measurements, using  commonly available mechanisms. Some examples of mechanisms not considered here are management  controllers (e.g., as the embedded management engine in Intel’s Sandy Bridge and successor chipsets), as  well as microcontrollers embedded into BIOS storage devices.  E.1 Example 1 - Possible implementation using a high-assurance kernel or hypervisor  In this example implementation, a trusted supervisor (such as a trustworthy hypervisor or high-assurance  separation kernel) is used to create the necessary RoTs for BIOS integrity measurements, based on the  CPU startup logic (Section E.1) and supervisor execution modes (Section E.4, item 3) hardware RoTs.  The supervisor is responsible for inductively protecting the RoTs as well as ensuring the integrity of the  BIOS and its settings during operation and across updates.  1. At a machine reset, the CPU starts executing the first instruction of the BIOS out of the BIOS  storage device (e.g., flash chip).  2. The BIOS completes initialization and turns control directly over to a trusted supervisor, or to a  trusted bootloader which finds and loads the trusted supervisor.  3. The trusted supervisor is responsible for implementing the [NIST-SP800-147] guidelines and for  completely mediating and controlling access to the machine configuration, including the  configuration of the CPU startup logic and the BIOS contents and settings, as well as the  configuration of the boot storage device containing the bootloader and the code and configuration  of the supervisor itself.  4. The trusted supervisor also forms the RTM, RTS, and RTR for BIOS integrity measurements, and  must protect stored measurement results (e.g., as part of the protected state on the boot storage  device) and allow those results to be provably freshly reported (e.g., so they cannot be spoofed or  replayed). For this purpose, the supervisor may make use of secret or private keys, for example  stored in the BIOS or boot storage devices.  5. Whether on demand, on boot, or at time of BIOS upgrade, the supervisor can prepare BIM reports  by measuring such things as (a) all BIOS code and (b) all critical BIOS data, such as non-writable  configuration settings, and (c) the NVRAM configuration data.  6. It is the responsibility of the BIOS and the supervisor to ensure that the supervisor (and only the  supervisor) will again be booted after the next hardware reset. The BIOS must protect itself and  any stored RTR cryptographic keys (e.g., by destroying those keys), unless the BIOS can  establish that control will pass to a verified copy of the trusted supervisor after BIOS initialization  finishes.  The above implementation provides neither the Mutable State Tolerance nor Memory Disclosure  Tolerance properties described in Section 3.1.  E.2  Example 2 - Possible implementation using latch-based mechanisms  In this example implementation, which assumes a [NIST-SP800-147] architecture, a combination of  BIOS startup code and SMM code installed by the BIOS at startup is used to create the necessary RoTs  for BIOS integrity measurements, based on the CPU startup logic (Section D.1), SMM execution mode  (Section D.4), and BIOS storage device access control (Section D.3) hardware RoTs. The BIOS itself and  BIOS INTEGRITY MEASUREMENT GUIDELINES (DRAFT)  39  its SMM code is responsible for inductively protecting the RoTs as well as ensuring the integrity of the  BIOS and its settings during operation and across updates.  1. At a machine reset, the CPU starts executing the first instruction of the BIOS out of the BIOS  storage device (e.g., flash chip).  2. To implement the [NIST-SP800-147] guidelines the BIOS first checks if a valid, signed BIOS  upgrade is available in accessible storage (e.g., on disk, in free space in the BIOS flash chip, or in  an inserted USB key). Finding no upgrade is needed, the BIOS may check its own integrity; this  should only be needed to guard against bit rot, since BIOS integrity is inductively preserved  through runtime write-protection.  3. The BIOS then sets up SMM mode and copies a BIOS-specific private key into SMRAM. The  BIOS also makes a copy of all its BIOS/NVRAM configuration data to SMRAM. SMM code is  responsible for runtime BIOS measurements and the key signs BIM results.  4. The BIOS then programs locked-until-machine-reset latches to (a) make non-writable all BIOS  code and all critical data, such as non-writable configuration settings, and (b) make inaccessible,  i.e., non-readable and non-writable, the BIOS flash region containing the BIOS-specific private  key.  5. The BIOS turns control over to the bootloader, which finds and loads an OS.  6. At runtime, a nonce is provided to create a report on a BIM attribute, such as, for instance, (a) the  BIOS code bytes in the BIOS flash chip, (b) the current or boot-time NVRAM configuration, (c)  the state of the locked-until-machine-reset latches and related machine control areas, etc.  7. SMM code is invoked, via one or more SMIs, and the SMM code measures the asked for  attribute, such as, for (c) by querying the control registers in the BIOS flash chip itself and in the  chipset (e.g., the southbridge).  8. The SMM code combines its measurements with the nonce into a message digest, and signs that  digest with the BIOS-specific private key.  The above implementation provides neither the Mutable State Tolerance nor Memory Disclosure  Tolerance properties described in Section 3.1.  E.3  Example 3 - Possible implementation using TPM-based mechanisms  In this example implementation, common in enterprise clients today, a combination of BIOS startup code  and the TCG-specified TPM is used to create the necessary RoTs for BIOS integrity measurements, based  on the CPU startup logic (Section D.1), TPM (Section D.5), and BIOS storage-device access control  (Section D.3) hardware RoTs. The BIOS itself is responsible for inductively protecting the Software  Measurement Agents as well as ensuring the integrity of the BIOS and its settings during operation and  across updates.  1. At a machine reset, the CPU starts executing the first instruction of an immutable BIOS boot  block out of the BIOS storage device, and the TPM registers are set to known values.  2. The immutable BIOS boot block measures (a) all BIOS code and (b) all critical BIOS data, such  as non-writable configuration settings, and (c) the NVRAM configuration data and extends these  measurements into separate PCRs on the TPM. The TPM is responsible for storing measurements  and reporting BIM results, and the TPM key is used to sign BIM results.  3. The BIOS boot block turns control over to code resident in the measured, mutable parts of the  BIOS storage device, which in turn passes control to the bootloader to find and load an OS. Note  BIOS INTEGRITY MEASUREMENT GUIDELINES (DRAFT)  40  that this implementation does NOT meet [NIST-SP800-147], since no attempt is made to  establish BIOS code integrity, e.g., by write-protecting code regions in the BIOS storage device.  4. At runtime, a nonce is provided to create a report on a BIM attribute, such as, for instance, (a) the  BIOS code hash, (b) the boot-time NVRAM configuration, (c) the state of the locked-until- machine-reset latches and related machine control areas, etc.  5. A PCR register in the TPM is combined with the nonce, and signed by the TPM-resident key, to  create a report on, for example, the BIOS code and configuration present at boot time.  E.4  Example 4 - Possible implementation using CPU-late-launch-based mechanisms  In this example implementation, a combination of BIOS startup code and the TCG-compliant CPU late- launch is used to create the necessary RoTs for BIOS integrity measurements, based on the CPU startup  logic (Section D.1), TPM (Section D.5), and runtime re-initialized CPU execution mode (Section D.4)  hardware RoTs. The hardware itself is responsible for inductively protecting the RoTs, while the integrity  of the BIOS and its settings during operation and across updates may be protected via various software  means—or even not protected at all.  1. At a machine reset, the CPU starts executing the first instruction of the BIOS out of the BIOS  storage device.  2. A flaw in the implementation of [NIST-SP800-147] guidelines may have allowed the BIOS to be  corrupted. However, the late-launch facilities allow BIOS integrity to be measured in a way that  will reveal this corruption, potentially revealing an attack.  3. The BIOS turns control over to the bootloader, which finds and loads an OS.  4. At runtime, a nonce is provided to create a report on a BIM attribute, such as, for instance, (a) the  BIOS code hash, (b) the NVRAM configuration, (c) the state of the locked-until-machine-reset  latches and related machine control areas, etc.  5. The CPU enters a clean, well-defined environment through late-launch facilities, with known,  well-defined values in some TPM registers.  6. The late-launch environment measures such things as (a) all BIOS code and (b) all critical BIOS  data, such as non-writable configuration settings, and (c) the NVRAM configuration data and  writes to well-defined, separate PCRs on the TPM. The TPM is responsible for storing  measurements and reporting BIM results, and the TPM key is used to sign BIM results.  7. A PCR register in the TPM is combined with the nonce, and signed by the TPM-resident key, to  create a report on, for example, the BIOS code present at boot time.  2013-04-25T15:29:02-0400  CSRC Webmaster +serialNumber=0001",

computers such as desktops and laptops rely on the Basic Input/Output System (BIOS) to initialize  their hardware during boot. The BIOS is firmware, and it can be configured. If the BIOS code or  configuration is altered from the intended state, either maliciously or accidentally, the desktop or laptop  may experience losses of confidentiality, integrity, and availability, including system instability, system  failure, and information leakage. Also, the desktop or laptop could be vulnerable to more elaborate attacks  such as covert monitoring, and it could be used as a stepping stone for attacking other systems. These  consequences underscore why it is so important to detect changes to the BIOS code and configuration—  and this can be accomplished by measuring and monitoring the integrity of the BIOS.  This publication explains the fundamentals of BIOS integrity measurement, such as basic requirements  that must be met in order to measure BIOS integrity, and typical data flows for BIOS integrity  measurement and reporting. This material provides a foundation for the core of the document, which  presents guidelines to hardware and software vendors that develop products that can support secure BIOS  integrity measurement mechanisms. These guidelines define in detail the requirements and  recommendations for vendors to follow in support of BIOS integrity measurement.  The following are key requirements and recommendations for vendors supporting BIOS integrity  measurement. Note that the formal declarations of these requirements and recommendations occur in  Section 3; these are summaries and do not take the place of the more detailed Section 3 statements.  Provide the hardware support necessary to implement credible Roots of Trust for BIOS integrity  measurements.  Roots of Trust are components (software, hardware, or hybrid) and computing engines that constitute a  set of unconditionally trusted functions. Reliable and trustworthy BIOS integrity measurement and  reporting depend upon software agents; each software agent relies upon Roots of Trust, and the level of  trustworthiness in each agent depends on its Roots of Trust. BIOS integrity measurement requires the  coordination of a Measurement Agent to harvest measurements, a Storage Agent to protect the  measurements from modification until they can be reported, and a Reporting Agent to reliably report the  measurements. Each of these agents has a corresponding Root of Trust (Root of Trust for Measurement,  etc.) These Roots of Trust must act in concert and build on each other to enable reliable and trustworthy  measurement, reporting, and verification of BIOS integrity measurements.  Enable endpoints to measure the integrity of all BIOS executable components and configuration  data components at boot time.  A key factor in a meaningful integrity measurement comparison scheme is establishing and maintaining,  with confidence, a known baseline of attributes and measurements. Endpoint vendors have various ways  to convey attributes to users; regardless of how this is done, the reason for the attributes is to give the user  a means of assessing the validity of the BIOS integrity measurements reported by the endpoint and  developing a level of confidence in the reports it receives about the overall health status of the endpoint.  This publication defines the attributes that endpoint vendors must provide and the minimal essential BIOS  integrity measurements that all endpoints must be capable of reporting.  Securely transmit measurements of BIOS integrity from endpoints to the Measurement Assessment  Authority (MAA).  When measurements are reliably and robustly reported, the MAA can accurately determine the state of  the security relevant BIOS configuration items on each endpoint. This allows the MAA to report on and  1  BIOS INTEGRITY MEASUREMENT GUIDELINES (DRAFT)  act upon the items with which the organization is concerned. Secure transmission of BIOS integrity  measurements ensures that measurements are not modified, disclosed, or forged in transit by malicious  parties. Further, proper selection of transmission protocols should ensure maximum interoperability,  freshness, and efficiency.  2  BIOS INTEGRITY MEASUREMENT GUIDELINES (DRAFT)  1. Introduction  1.1 Authority  The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) developed this document in furtherance of its  statutory responsibilities under the Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA) of 2002,  Public Law 107-347.  NIST is responsible for developing standards and guidelines, including minimum requirements, for  providing adequate information security for all agency operations and assets; however, such standards and  guidelines shall not apply to national security systems. This guideline is consistent with the requirements  of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-130, Section 8b (3), “Securing Agency  Information Systems,” as analyzed in A-130, Appendix IV: Analysis of Key Sections. Supplemental  information is provided in A-130, Appendix III.  This guideline has been prepared for use by Federal agencies. It may be used by nongovernmental  organizations on a voluntary basis and is not subject to copyright, although attribution is requested.  Nothing in this document should be taken to contradict standards and guidelines made mandatory and  binding on Federal agencies by the Secretary of Commerce under statutory authority nor should these  guidelines be interpreted as altering or superseding the existing authorities of the Secretary of Commerce,  Director of the OMB, or any other Federal official.  1.2 Purpose and Scope  This document outlines the security components and security guidelines needed to establish a secure  Basic Input/Output System (BIOS) integrity measurement and reporting chain. BIOS is a critical security  component in systems due to its unique and privileged position within the personal computer (PC)  architecture. A malicious or outdated BIOS could allow or be part of a sophisticated, targeted attack on an  organization —either a permanent denial of service (if the BIOS is corrupted) or a persistent malware  presence (if the BIOS is implanted with malware).  This document identifies two motivating scenarios in Section 2.1 for the guidelines in this document.  First, the BIOS integrity measurement mechanisms are intended to detect changes to the system BIOS  code stored on the system flash. Unauthorized changes to the system BIOS code could allow malicious  software to run during the boot process. Second, the mechanisms are intended to detect changes to the  configuration of the system BIOS. Unauthorized system BIOS configuration changes could place systems  in insecure configurations, leaving them vulnerable to attack.  The guidelines in this document are intended to facilitate the development of products that can detect  problems with the BIOS so that organizations can take appropriate remedial action to prevent or limit  harm. The security controls and procedures specified in this document are oriented to desktops and  laptops deployed in an enterprise environment.  While this publication focuses on security properties and capabilities for BIOS integrity measurement  products, it will also provide administrators and security officers in organizations with a better  understanding of the assurances that these types of products can provide, and the procedures that will  need to be integrated into system previsioning and management processes once these technologies are  deployed. The guidelines in this document can only be met with a combination of hardware and software  support on devices spread across an organizations information technology infrastructure. This includes  supporting roots of trust and security software on endpoint devices for obtaining and reporting  3  BIOS INTEGRITY MEASUREMENT GUIDELINES (DRAFT)  measurements, support for requesting and interpreting measurements on enterprise-management systems,  and potentially support on network devices to remediate problems. These components will be critical  elements of a BIOS integrity measurement system.  1.3 Audience  The intended audience for this document includes hardware and software vendors that develop products  that can support secure BIOS integrity measurement mechanisms. These include the endpoint vendor,  typically the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM), the operating system (OS) vendor, and security  application software vendors. System administrators and information system security professionals may  also consult this document to understand the capabilities of these products and the procedures that will  need to be incorporated into their system management processes when deploying these technologies.  The material in this document is technically oriented, and it is assumed that readers have at least a basic  understanding of system and network security. The document provides background information to help  such readers understand the topics that are discussed. Readers are encouraged to take advantage of other  resources (including those listed in this document) for more detailed information.  1.4 Document Structure  The remainder of this document is organized into the following major sections and appendices:  ●  Section 2 presents an overview of BIOS integrity measurement and its role in the enterprise in  detecting attacks against the BIOS in an operational environment.  ●  Section 3 describes the components necessary to measure the integrity of a BIOS and the security  guidelines recommended for each component.  ●  Appendix A contains a summary of the security guidelines for system BIOS integrity  measurement implementations.  ●  Appendix B defines acronyms, abbreviations, and terms used in this document.  ●  Appendix C identifies references.  ●  Appendix D contains a list of examples for how a company might choose to implement Roots of  Trust.  ●  Appendix E contains a list of examples for how a company might choose to implement the  guidelines using existing capabilities.  1.5 Document Conventions  The key words “MUST”, “MUST NOT”, “REQUIRED”, “SHALL”, “SHALL NOT”, “SHOULD”,  “SHOULD NOT”, “RECOMMENDED”, “MAY”, and “OPTIONAL” in this document are to be  interpreted as described in Request for Comment (RFC) 2119 [IETF-RFC-2119]. When these words  appear in regular case, such as “should” or “may”, they are not intended to be interpreted as RFC 2119  key words.  Within this publication, the criteria for assigning requirements to MUST/SHALL, SHOULD, and MAY  are as follows:  MUSTs/SHALLs: Requirements that are needed to support the scenarios outlined in Section 2, AND  are feasible in the near term with currently available technology.  4  BIOS INTEGRITY MEASUREMENT GUIDELINES (DRAFT)  5  SHOULDs: Capabilities that are highly desirable and may be required in some circumstances to  support a particular operational need or robustness level.  MAYs: Optional requirements that may be desirable under some circumstances.  BIOS INTEGRITY MEASUREMENT GUIDELINES (DRAFT)  5  2. Background  Client computers such as desktops and laptops contain program code that facilitates the hardware  initialization process. The code is stored in non-volatile memory and is commonly referred to as boot  firmware. The primary firmware used to initialize the system is called the Basic Input/Output System  (BIOS) or the system BIOS. If a BIOS is altered from its intended state, either maliciously or accidentally,  the device on which it was altered may have a negative impact on the organization because the device is  not necessarily operating in its intended state. Possible consequences include system instability, system  failure, information leakage, and other losses of confidentiality, integrity, and availability. In addition, the  system could be vulnerable to more elaborate attacks such as covert monitoring, and attackers could use  the system as a stepping stone for attacking other systems. These examples illustrate why it is so  important to detect changes to the BIOS and its configuration by measuring and monitoring its integrity.  This section provides an overview of BIOS integrity measurement (BIM) and its role in the organization  in detecting, reporting, and mitigating attacks against the BIOS in an operational environment. The  primary components required to accomplish this are identified and the threats addressed by this  methodology are described.  2.1 BIOS Integrity Measurement Scenarios  This section presents scenarios that define candidate use cases, which drive the requirements and  recommendations presented throughout the rest of this document. These use cases serve as a basis to  identify user actions, associated transactions, inherent risks, and potential security mitigations.  The scenarios are predicated on objective state and process maturity for IT organizations in the area of  BIM. To a large degree, this objective state closely mirrors the best practices employed by many  organizations in the area of patch management for endpoints today. Specifically, organizations are  expected to implement a provisioning process for new endpoints whereby BIM is fully integrated into the  model. For example, provisioning an endpoint would include these additional BIOS integrity-specific  activities that complement existing imaging, asset tracking, and registration activities:  ● Installing and/or verifying the correct BIOS revision for a given client  ● Imaging the BIOS with the appropriate BIOS settings  ● Setting BIOS passwords  ● Asserting any security controls requiring physical presence (which may include the Trusted  Platform Module (TPM))  ● Registering the endpoint identity and integrity metrics in the pertinent IT databases  Changes in any of these security variables may imply an anomalous situation and potentially more  hazardous effects. Client operating system agents exist today that report basic information about these  settings at the network management level, and they are a good initial tool for assessing BIOS security  posture. As soon as feasible, though, these reporting agents need to be migrated to rely on integrity  infrastructure anchored to tamperproof roots of trust.  2.1.1 Scenario 1: Something has changed in the system BIOS  BIOS updates are frequently released for client computers. These updates often fix bugs in the power  management subsystem, hard disk or network management, or other important components. However, a  BIOS could also be changed for malicious purposes. It is important that system administrators be able to  BIOS INTEGRITY MEASUREMENT GUIDELINES (DRAFT)  6  tell what version of BIOS is loaded on a device so as to be able to correctly manage it. This must be done  while meeting the following basic challenges:  ● IT management has to be able to trust that the measurements of BIOS firmware collected are  correct.  o There needs to be a root of trust to trust the collection of BIOS firmware integrity  measurements.  o An initial valid baseline of BIOS firmware integrity measurements must be collected,  potentially using the device’s root of trust to collect and report the baseline measurements.  o BIOS firmware integrity measurements must be provably fresh (the response is not just a  replay of an earlier good response).  o BIOS firmware integrity measurements must have provable integrity (it has not changed  between the responder and recipient).  o The origin of BIOS firmware integrity measurements must be established (it came from the  machine that IT thinks it came from).  ● IT management has to be able to interpret reported BIOS firmware integrity measurements.  o Standard formats are important.  o The variability of systems needs to be accounted for.  ● The users and administrators must know when something has changed in the BIOS without  having to perform extensive calculations by hand.  2.1.2 Scenario 2: Something has changed in the BIOS configuration settings  BIOS settings have a large influence on the security of a system. A partial list of questions to be answered  regarding settings includes:  ● Passwords  o Has the administrator password been set?  o Has the Power On Password been set?  o Has a hard disk password been set?  ● BIOS-based management (BBM) software  o Has it been turned on?  o What is the configuration of the BIOS-based management software?  ● Boot  o Has the boot order changed?  o Will the computer boot from anything other than the hard disk?  ● Ports and other hardware interfaces  o Are USB ports turned on?  o Are 1394 ports turned on?  o Are PCMCIA or smart card readers turned on?  BIOS INTEGRITY MEASUREMENT GUIDELINES (DRAFT)  7  o Are Near Field Communication (NFC) ports turned on?  Any changes to these settings can indicate that the system has become less secure or has been  compromised. Like the first scenario, it is important that both users and administrators be able to  determine what the BIOS settings are and if they are within policy. This document requires capabilities  that will allow the administrator to tell if a BIOS configuration setting has changed, and encourages the  use of capabilities that will allow that administrator to distinguish which settings have changed.  BIOS configuration changes require the following, which are similar to, but extend the capabilities of  BIOS code changes:  ● IT management has to be able to trust that the BIOS configuration integrity measurements are  correct.  o There needs to be a root of trust to trust the BIOS configuration integrity measurements.  o The measurements must be provably fresh.  o The measurements must have provable integrity.  o The origin of the measurements must be established.  ● IT management has to be able to interpret the response.  o Standard formats are important.  o The variability of systems needs to be accounted for.  2.2 BIOS Integrity Measurement Flow  In order to measure BIOS integrity, certain basic requirements must be met, including:  ● A means of generating and collecting the measurements  ● A means of storing the measurements that is either tamper resistant or tamper evident  ● A means of conveying the measurements to an analyzing agent  ● A means of analyzing the measured result, and a means of administering a machine based on the  results of that determination  The endpoint device must have a means of measuring the BIOS firmware and forwarding those  measurements to an administrative authority. The endpoint must do this while protecting the integrity,  authenticity, non-repudiation, and, in some cases, the confidentiality of those measurements.  Figure 1 illustrates the architecture that supports the generation, forwarding, and analysis of BIMs as well  as remediation actions based on the analysis. These solutions may be provided by a single vendor or a  combination of vendors. On the endpoint, the Roots of Trust for Measurement, Storage, and Reporting  form the foundation for providing the necessary security services. Section 3.1 covers roots of trust in  greater depth.

The Measurement generation  and Reporting Agents act on the measurement target and directly leverage the roots of trust to provide  security protection for the individual measurements and for the measurement and reporting processes.  Sections 3.2 and 3.3 provide more insight into both the measurements and associated processes. The  Collection and Transmission Agents provide a means of reliably collecting and transmitting the  measurements to a Measurement Assessment Authority (MAA) for further analysis. Sections 3.4 and 3.5  discuss functions of these agents. The Remediation Agent discussed in Section 3.6 provides a means for  an administrative authority to take action to remedy any issues with the endpoint discovered through the  analysis of the BIOS measurements.  In assessing the measurements, the MAA references a set of characteristics. These sets come in two  varieties: either endpoint attributes and measurements of BIOS code provided and vouched for (using  certificates) by the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM), Value Added Reseller (VAR), or an  Independent Software Vendor (ISV), or measurements of configuration settings gathered by the  user/administrator of the endpoint during initial provisioning of the endpoint or the MAA. The  assemblage of ideal measurement characteristics is referred to as golden measurements.  BIOS INTEGRITY MEASUREMENT GUIDELINES (DRAFT)  9  The MAA may host a number of services, such as a management console or dashboard that provides an  easy user interface to the analysis of BIOS attributes and measurements, allowing an administrator or  analyst to quickly determine the following:  ● The trustworthiness of the endpoint device reports  ● If machines are compliant (match the current set of golden measurements)  ● If machines are in need of remediation (BIOS settings are out of compliance or older golden  measurements are in use)  ● If machines are potentially dangerous (certain measurements are known to indicate malicious  activity)  Based on these reports, machines can be allowed or denied access to resources (e.g., allowed access to  network resources, allowed restricted access to network resources, such as a remediation network, or  denied access), or the reports could trigger other administrative actions.  Figure 1 depicts a typical data flow for BIOS integrity measurement and reporting:  1. An initial set of trusted measurements (golden measurements) is obtained. These measurements  are either provided from third parties (e.g., OEM) to the MAA or generated at initial provisioning  by system administrators.  2. During the boot of the endpoint, a sequence of measurements is made of the BIOS firmware and  its configuration settings by firmware in a trust chain rooted in a Root of Trust for Measurement  (RTM).  The RTM stores a hashed representation of these is stored or protected by the Root of  Trust for Storage (RTS), and a log from which they can be reconstructed is stored somewhere in  memory so that a Transmission Agent may reconstruct the measurements.  3. In response to an action by either the endpoint requesting a service or an MAA request, the MAA  generates a request for measurements, including a random nonce. The Transmission Agent  receives this request, determines that it pertains to BIOS Integrity Measurements, and therefore  passes it on to the Collection Agent.  4. The Collection Agent parses the request and passes the nonce to the Reporting Agent, which uses  the Root of Trust for Reporting to obtain a signature of the nonce and the stored hash  representation of the measurements.  5. The Reporting Agent passes that data (along with the log retrieved from memory) back to the  Collection Agent.  6. The Collection Agent formats this data in a standard format and passes it back to the  Transmission Agent.  7. The Transmission Agent transmits the data to the MAA’s Verification Agent.  8. The Verification Agent verifies the signature over the hashes by verifying both the public key  used to sign them and the signature itself, and that the nonce contained in the report matches the  nonce sent in the request for measurements. It then compares those signed measurements with the  golden measurements it obtained earlier.  9. Results of that comparison, collated with other such comparisons from other machines may be  displayed via a user interface (such as a management console or dashboard) to the administrator  and/or provided to an automated enforcement/access point.  BIOS INTEGRITY MEASUREMENT GUIDELINES (DRAFT)  10  10. If the results are provided to an automated enforcement/access point, the administrator or his  proxy then makes a decision pursuant to the results of the comparison, which may be to allow or  deny network access, send a signal to a Remediation Agent, or possibly send a service technician  to the machine to determine the reason for an erroneous result.  2.3 Transitioning to the Desired State  In the desired, or objective, state for BIM, measurement of BIOS is part of routine and automated client  scanning. As organizations progress from where they are today to the desired state, several steps must be  taken. Initially the measurements will only be collected and stored along with other endpoint health data.  This data will then be reviewed and analyzed on a regular basis to develop an understanding of the  baseline behavior of client BIOS within the organization. Anomalies will be investigated and manually  remediated. As dashboard suites and other operational tools are updated to incorporate BIOS integrity  information as first order data, the sideline activity and responsibility for BIM can be transitioned to the  standard IT operations team. Over time, this will become simply another standard offering of IT services.  BIOS INTEGRITY MEASUREMENT GUIDELINES (DRAFT)  11  3. BIM Functional Components  The following sections provide a description and associated requirement guidelines for the BIM  functional components:  ● Section 3.1 addresses Roots of Trust (RoTs).  ● Section 3.2 defines the establishment of BIOS integrity attribute and measurement baselines.  ● Section 3.3 addresses BIOS integrity reporting.  ● Section 3.4 defines the collection and transmission of BIMs to the MAA.  ● Section 3.5 describes and defines the requirements for the MAA itself.  ● Section 3.6 addresses potential remediation actions based on the collected and transmitted  measurements and attributes.  3.1 Roots of Trust (RoTs)  Roots of Trust (RoTs) are at the foundation of any BIOS integrity assurance. RoTs are components  (software, hardware, or hybrid) and computing engines that constitute a set of unconditionally trusted  functions, and that must always behave in an expected manner because their misbehavior cannot be  detected. They are particularly critical for BIOS integrity measurement since the BIOS is generally  responsible for the configuration of the software execution environment, including the mapping of  physical memory and devices.  The trustworthiness of Software Agents that leverage one or more RoTs is dependent on the  trustworthiness of the RoT itself and its attack surface. The complete set of RoTs has at least the  minimum set of capabilities to enable the measurement, storage, and reporting of the endpoint  characteristics that affect the endpoint’s trustworthiness. A Hardware RoT is preferred over a Software  RoT since it can be demonstrated to behave in an expected manner in a significantly higher percentage of  attack scenarios.  Reliable and trustworthy BIOS integrity measurement and reporting depend upon Software Agents to  perform functions upon which a verifier must rely. Each Software Agent relies upon RoTs and the level  of trustworthiness in the Agent depends on its RoTs. The RoT for any Software Agent is the computing  engine either capable of reliably and accurately performing that Agent’s functions, or responsible for  reliably spawning Software Agents to perform the task. As such, an Agent may be implemented entirely  within the RoT or may be spawned by its RoT via a trusted chain anchored in the RoT. Therefore, the  trustworthiness of the Agent is dependent on its respective RoT and trust chain.  The highest-assurance mechanisms for BIOS integrity measurement provide mutable state tolerance,  where the mechanisms are able to provide reliable and trustworthy reports on the BIOS and its  configuration, irrespective of the overall machine configuration or the contents of the BIOS storage  device. In addition, the highest-assurance mechanisms for BIOS integrity measurement provide memory  disclosure tolerance, where measurements reported by the mechanisms must be provably fresh (i.e.,  recently taken, generally for a specific request) and not spoofed by any party, even with full knowledge of  all contents ever present in software-readable memory throughout all past software execution. Thus, such  mechanisms are more robust against exploits of software vulnerabilities, and are not affected by  disclosure of cryptographic keys present in software-readable memory.  BIOS INTEGRITY MEASUREMENT GUIDELINES (DRAFT)  12  3.1.1 Overview of Software Agents  BIM requires the coordination of a Measurement Agent to harvest measurements, a Storage Agent to  protect the measurements from modification until they can be reported, and a Reporting Agent to reliably  report the measurements. If the measurements are reported immediately after harvesting, there may not be  a need to use a Storage Agent. A comprehensive system for ensuring BIOS integrity will also include  some form of verification of the collected measurements, and correspondingly will utilize Verification  Agents that assess reported measurements. Such Verification Agents may be resident on the measured  endpoint, or may reside externally in the management services or infrastructure. In addition, if any  Software Agents can be modified or updated, then the trustworthiness of such Agents depends upon the  mechanism used to implement updates. Thus, if such updates are possible, the endpoint should include  Update Agents to effect software updates in a reliable manner providing protections equivalent to [NIST- SP800-147].  3.1.2 Overview of Roots of Trust  The RoT for Measurement (RTM) is a computing engine capable of making inherently reliable integrity  measurements. It is the root of the chain of transitive trust for subsequent Measurement Agents. A small  RTM applied very soon after a re-initialization of an endpoint may have greater value than an RTM  instantiated later, mainly in minimizing the attack surface’s exposure to subversion of the measurement  process. The later the endpoint invokes the RTM, the more opportunity an adversary has to subvert the  measurement trust chain. The larger the RTM, the greater the chance that a flaw in its implementation  will provide an opportunity for an adversary to subvert the RTM.  The RoT for Storage (RTS) is a computing engine capable of maintaining a tamper-evident summary of  integrity measurement values and the sequence of those measurements. It does not include the details of  the sequence of integrity measurements, but rather holds integrity hashes for those sequences. These  integrity hashes can either be used to verify the integrity of a log containing the integrity measurement  values and the sequence of those measurements, or it can be used as a proxy for that log. The RTS  maintains these integrity hashes in tamper-evident locations. For example, the interface may allow  register extensions (defined in Section 3.2.2.2) but disallow direct register writes. These authorized  interfaces are commonly called protected capabilities. Together the tamper-evident locations and  protected capabilities collectively form the RTS.  The RoT for Reporting (RTR) is a computing engine capable of reliably reporting information provided by  the RTM and its Measurement Agent(s) or held by the RTS. The RTR serves as the basis for the  capabilities of integrity and non-repudiation of reports of measurement data. It necessarily leverages the  RTM and RTS. A key requirement for the RTR is an unambiguous identity, both of the endpoint and the  components being measured and reported. This identity may be persistent or temporary. Signatures of  measurement report data using keys are a common mechanism to provide unambiguous identity.  Certificates for keys may certify membership in a group or identify a particular member.  3.1.3 Agent Coordination  The trustworthiness of the coordination of all of the relevant Agents in combination gives Verification  Agents the confidence to make a reliable assessment of the BIOS integrity of measured endpoints.  Evaluation of the trust properties afforded by the composed system is critical, and evaluation of an  individual Agent’s trust properties is only relevant in the context of the entire system.  Figure 2 illustrates that the RoTs must act in concert and build on each other to enable reliable and  trustworthy measurement, reporting, and verification of BIMs. In addition, these RoTs must properly  BIOS INTEGRITY MEASUREMENT GUIDELINES (DRAFT)  13  integrate with mechanisms for integrity protection and authentication for secure BIOS updates. The  implementation of these RoTs, and other endpoint security mechanisms, may be achieved in an integrated  fashion, where all are comprised within a single software component, such as the BIOS. Whether the  implementation is monolithic or disaggregated, the combination of these RoTs, and the combination of  the RoTs that they are built upon, forms the basis for the trustworthiness of the total BIM solution.  3.1.4 Security Guidelines for RoTs  1. The endpoint vendor SHALL provide the hardware support necessary to implement credible  RTMs, RTSs, and RTRs and use that support to implement corresponding RoTs for BIMs.  2. The endpoint vendor SHALL combine the mechanisms of the RTM, RTS, and RTR to form an  integrated, reliable foundation for BIMs.  3. The endpoint vendor SHOULD provide mechanisms for integrity-protected, non-bypassable  implementation of authenticated or secure BIOS updates, as necessary to conform to [NIST- SP800-147].  4. The endpoint vendor MAY provide hardware support for implementing a credible dynamic RTM  for post boot-time measurements. The endpoint vendor and OS vendor MAY use that support to  implement such an RoT for BIMs.  3.2 Integrity Attribute and Measurement Baselines  A key factor in a meaningful integrity measurement comparison scheme is establishing and maintaining,  with confidence, a known baseline of attributes and measurements with which one can make decisions.  The establishment of a baseline must take into account two scenarios: endpoint devices with a BIOS of  unknown or questionable provenance, and endpoint devices with a known and trusted (protected and  signed) BIOS. This section lists attributes and measurements for the baselines.  3.2.1 Overview of BIOS Integrity Attributes  Attributes are used for assessing confidence in BIOS integrity measurements. Endpoint vendors have  various ways to convey attributes to users. The endpoint vendor may present these attributes along with  golden BIOS measurements in a certificate to the user in an out-of-band channel (i.e., not delivered with  the endpoint itself, but through other means). The endpoint vendor may allow the user to query the  Verification Agent  Measurement Agent  Storage Agent  Reporting Agent  RTM RTS RTR RTV  Verification Agent MAA  Figure 2: Coordination of RoTs and Agents  BIOS INTEGRITY MEASUREMENT GUIDELINES (DRAFT)  14  endpoint and extract the attributes directly. Alternatively, the endpoint vendor may allow the user to  present a serial number to a managed online service, which then responds with a list of attributes for the  endpoint as it was delivered. Regardless of how the user obtains the attributes for a particular endpoint,  the reason for the attributes is to give the user a means of assessing the validity of the BIMs reported by  the endpoint and developing a level of confidence in the reports it receives about the overall health status  of the endpoint beyond only the BIMs.  3.2.1.1 List of BIOS Integrity Attributes  This section lists BIOS integrity attributes and suggests possible values for them.  1. RTM - The attribute of the RTM provides information about the amount of time/code available  to the adversary before measurement of the BIOS takes place, often referred to as the size of the  attack surface. The sooner an endpoint can leverage an RTM and take BIOS measurements, the  smaller the attack surface, and the more confidence an assessor can have in the measurements.  The later in time after initialization or re-initialization an endpoint leverage an RTM before taking  BIOS measurements, the larger the attack surface and the less confidence an assessor may have in  the measurements. Examples of the values for an attribute of an RTM include:  ● Class 1 (i.e., the endpoint instantiates the RTM as part of the early BIOS POST initialization)  ● Class 2 (i.e., the endpoint instantiates the RTM after the early BIOS POST initialization)  2. RTS - The attribute of the RTS provides information about the protections afforded for tamper- evident locations. The more likely an RTS is to rebuff attacks from an adversary, the more  confidence an assessor can have in the measurements it contains. The values for the RTS may  take on the following:  ● Class 1: Hardware-based (e.g., TPM 1.2, processor-based protected storage)  ● Class 2: Software-based (e.g., OS key store, System Management Random Access Memory  (SMRAM))  3. RTR - The attribute of the RTR provides information about the protections afforded to the data to  be reported, the keying material used to provide authentication, the code using the key for  signatures, and non-repudiation services. The more likely an RTR is to rebuff attacks from an  adversary, the more confidence an assessor can have in the reports. The values for an RTR  attribute may include:  ● Class 1: Hardware-based (e.g., TPM 1.2, processor-based)  ● Class 2: Software-based (e.g., OS, BIOS Boot Block + Key stored in BIOS)  4. BIOS Signature Present - This is an indication of whether or not the BIOS has been signed and  the signatures are present with the BIOS. Values include:  ● None (none of the BIOS is signed)  ● Partial (some of the BIOS components are signed and present)  ● Full (All BIOS components have been signed and the signatures are present)  5. BIOS Update Mechanisms - This attribute provides an indication of the type of BIOS update  mechanism employed by the vendor. The importance of this attribute lies in the diligence  exercised by the BIOS provider in providing the latest update of the BIOS code and data  provided. In the context of security, the presence of a reliable BIOS mechanism provides the end  user with assurance that the BIOS provider can safely remediate their products against threats  BIOS INTEGRITY MEASUREMENT GUIDELINES (DRAFT)  15  should the need arise. A BIOS with an unreliable or nonexistent update mechanism may be held  in suspicion. Values include:  ● None (it’s not possible to update the BIOS)  ● Capsule (from OS, write new BIOS to RAM, then perform a system reboot)  ● System Management Mode (SMM) (from OS, use SMM to modify the BIOS, then continue  without rebooting the system; reboot is necessary for realization of new BIOS)  ● Other  6. Virtualization - This attribute provides an indication of whether the BIOS originates from the  endpoint hardware or is provided as part of a virtual machine (VM). Values include:  ● None (physical BIOS present)  ● Full (virtual BIOS in play)  7. Flash Lockdown - This attribute provides an indication of the capability of the endpoint to  protect the flash where the BIOS resides from unauthorized modification. This term normally  refers to a hardware capability. The importance of this attribute lies in the diligence exercised by  the BIOS provider in providing protections against unauthorized modifications of the BIOS code  and data. In the context of security, the presence of reliable BIOS flash protection provides the  end user with confidence in the BIOS measurements. A BIOS with unreliable or nonexistent flash  protections may be held in suspicion. Values include:  ● None  ● Chipset  ● Native to flash chip  3.2.1.2 Security Guidelines for RoT Attributes  1. Endpoint vendors SHALL provide the attributes defined in Section 3.2.1.1.  2. Endpoint vendors SHALL provide reference measurements of executable BIOS boot code at the  lowest level of granularity for which they provide update and maintenance and that can be used to  verify measurements returned from the RTR.  3. Endpoint vendors SHALL provide a mechanism for measuring and reporting a baseline of  measurements for BIOS configuration data.  4. Endpoint vendors SHOULD deploy BIOS measurement and reporting mechanisms that do not  preclude extension to option ROMs external to the system BIOS.  5. Endpoint vendors SHOULD provide attributes in a standardized format.  6. Endpoint vendors MAY provide an indication of compliance with [NIST-SP800-147].  3.2.2 Overview of BIOS Integrity Measurements  This section defines the minimal essential BIMs all endpoints are to be capable of reporting. It addresses  the format of these measurements and how they are generated.  BIOS Boot Code Integrity Measurement - The BIOS boot code integrity measurement is either a  cryptographic hash of the BIOS boot code or an extended cryptographic hash of the BIOS boot code  modules. In either case, it can simply be referred to as “the hash”. The hash includes the following  BIOS INTEGRITY MEASUREMENT GUIDELINES (DRAFT)  16  components if implemented:  ● BIOS boot block  ● SMM code  ● Advanced Configuration and Power Interface (ACPI) code  ● Power On Self Test (POST) code  ● BIOS recovery mechanism code  ● BIOS update mechanism code  ● BBM software  ● RTM  ● Embedded Option ROMs (those Option ROMs embedded in the BIOS boot code and controlled  by the BIOS vendor)  BIOS Configuration Data Integrity Measurements - The BIOS configuration data integrity  measurement is either a cryptographic hash of the user configurable data components of the BIOS, or an  extended cryptographic hash of the individual configuration data components. All such BIOS  configuration data must be measured, with the exception of endpoint configuration information that is  automatically updated, such as clock registers, and system unique information, such as asset numbers or  serial numbers. These must not be measured into the same register. If measured, system unique  information, such as asset numbers, serial numbers, password hashes, etc. should be measured into a  different privacy register. This allows for a consistent measurement to be established both among  identical systems and between boot measurements of the same system, but also allows a system  administrator to determine if passwords have been changed.  In practice, live integrity measurements of BIOS components taken from various endpoints of the same  make and model produce distinct and unique values. This seems counterintuitive, especially for integrity  measurements of static BIOS components. The absence of golden BIOS measurements makes further  investigation problematic, especially in distinguishing between compromised and authentic BIOSes.  In practice, RoTs maintain composites of BIMs. Although specifications recommend how individual  integrity measurements should be stored and preserved, the lack of standardization makes interpretation  of these measurements for forensics problematic.  3.2.2.1 BIOS Integrity Measurement Generation and Storage  In order to monitor and improve BIOS integrity, BIOS integrity measurements must start being securely  generated and stored. These measurements can then be transmitted, analyzed, reported on, and used to  provide remediation. This section describes how endpoints generate and store BIMs.  The endpoint RTM must serve as the anchor for the chain of trust for measurement. The endpoint forms a  chain of trust for measurement by having the endpoint RTM measure one or more binary components and  recording those measurement(s) in a safe place before the binary component(s) executes. In turn, the  endpoint maintains the chain of trust for measurement by delegating measurement to only those  components measured either by the endpoint RTM or by some other component whose measurement can  be traced back to the endpoint RTM. The chain of trust for measurement should measure all BIOS  configuration data (non-executable binaries) prior to the endpoint consuming it.  BIOS INTEGRITY MEASUREMENT GUIDELINES (DRAFT)  17  3.2.2.2 BIOS Integrity Measurement Registers  For clarity, this document creates and uses a number of “register” types. The term register is meant to  explain the various types of storage capabilities needed and how they are used, not to define any  particular implementation architecture or naming convention.  As the trust chain for measurement measures BIOS code and data, the endpoint must store the  measurements in a trusted place that would accommodate later monitoring and inspection should the  administrator of the endpoint desire it. The endpoint RTM and the chain of trust for measurement store  the measurements in Integrity Measurement Registers (IMRs) contained in the RTS. They will hash BIOS  components (code and data) using an approved cryptographic hash algorithm such as one of those  published in [NIST-FIPS180-3]. The IMRs should be of sufficient length to accommodate the entire  result of the hash chosen from the approved list.  BIOS integrity measurement implementers SHALL initialize each IMR to a known fixed value. They  may hash all the BIOS components intended for a register together at once and extend the result in a  BIOS IMR. Alternatively, implementers may create a composite of hashes by serially hashing BIOS  components one at a time and extending the BIOS code IMR in the following way for each component:  IMRnew = H(IMRold||H(BIOScomponent))  IMRnew is the new IMR  IMRold is the old value of the IMR  BIOScomponent is the BIOS component to be measured  H is a hash algorithm from the approved list  || is the concatenation operator  It is OPTIONAL to use a keyed hash algorithm, such as HMAC, when measuring BIOS components. A  randomized hash algorithm MAY be applied for additional collision resistance, such as the one published  in [NIST-SP800-106]. In that case, the size of the IMRs MUST accommodate the output of the  randomized hash algorithms, along with the additional parameters necessary to verify the hashes.  The endpoint SHALL initialize the IMRs to a known fixed value before measurement of any BIOS  component takes place. Ideally, power-on of the endpoint initializes these registers. Only an endpoint  reset which causes the BIOS to fully execute SHOULD cause the reset of these registers. An endpoint  recovering from the invocation of suspension (commonly called sleep and hibernation modes) will not  initialize IMRs, but rather restore valid values saved during the suspension process.  The endpoint accumulates all measurements of BIOS executable components together into one IMR.  Likewise, the endpoint performs the same process for all measurements of BIOS configuration data  components, with the exception of privacy sensitive data, such as passwords, serial numbers, asset  numbers, keying material, etc. and elements such as time which make golden measurements impossible.  These excluded items tend to be unique to platforms and could cause platforms that administrators have  configured identically to project different configuration data IMRs. Also, since these items are privacy  sensitive, administrators may want the option to configure the measurement and reporting of these values.  The endpoint SHALL accumulate BIOS executable code measurements in the BIOS code integrity  measurement register (CIMR), SHALL accumulate BIOS data measurements in the BIOS data integrity  measurement register (DIMR), and SHOULD accumulate BIOS privacy sensitive data in the BIOS  privacy integrity measurement register (PIMR).  BIOS INTEGRITY MEASUREMENT GUIDELINES (DRAFT)  18  3.2.2.3 BIOS Measurement Log  In addition to extending BIOS code and data measurements into the CIMR and DIMR, respectively,  BIOS functions MAY also extend optional measurements and events into them. To aid in disentangling  the measurements placed in the register, an administrator would find great value in a log that describes the  measurements and events extended into them. Several examples include:  ● The endpoint vendor maintains and updates BIOS code in modules, and programs the BIOS code  to measure and extend the CIMR on a module by module basis. A log would help an MAA detect  the cases in which one or more bad or unanticipated measurements were extended into the CIMR.  ● If the endpoint contains more than one BIOS image, e.g. an operational and a backup, an  administrator may want to gain additional details about which copy was measured and extended  into the CIMR. An early stage BIOS function may extend an “event” into the CIMR that signals  the choice taken, along with a corresponding entry in the log.  ● The BIOS may want to “cap” measurement extensions just before handing off execution to a  post-boot environment. By extending a “cap” event into the CIMR or DIMR and recording a  corresponding event in the log, an administrator can detect which events occurred during which  phase of the endpoint initialization.  ● BIOS configuration data has many permutations. An event log recording measurements and  events involving BIOS configuration data, if formatted appropriately, could aid in a  programmatic review for unanticipated changes.  A stored measurement log (SML) allows higher endpoint agents, such as the Reporting and Collection  Agents, to gather them for preprocessing and correlation before forwarding to an MAA. Since these  agents typically run in a post-boot environment, the BIOS SHOULD take care in preserving the contents  of the SML during the handoff to a new environment.  SML measurements typically have better granularity than CIMR or DIMR values, but do not have the  finest granularity of containing the raw BIOS firmware or configuration data. While a system SHALL  have SML data available for reporting, it SHOULD provide a means to programmatically report and  interpret the BIOS configuration data. The TCG provides a standard format for SML log entries in [TCG- ConvBiosSpec].  3.2.2.4 Security Guidelines for BIOS Integrity Measurement Generation and Storage  1. Measured Components  a. The endpoint SHALL measure all BIOS executable components.  b. The endpoint SHALL measure all BIOS configuration data components, with the exception  of privacy sensitive data.  c. The endpoint SHOULD measure privacy sensitive data separate from other BIOS  configuration data components.  2. BIOS Measurement Generation and Storage  a. The endpoint SHALL support boot-time measurement.  b. The endpoint SHALL use an RTM or a component in the chain of trust for measurement  rooted in an RTM to generate BIOS integrity measurements.  BIOS INTEGRITY MEASUREMENT GUIDELINES (DRAFT)  19  c. The endpoint SHALL use approved standard cryptographic techniques to generate BIOS  integrity measurements.  d. The endpoint SHALL use standard BIOS integrity measurements formats.  e. The format and reporting of BIMs – both golden measurements and endpoint measurements –  SHALL use open standards or specifications, such as [TCG-Manifest] and [TCG-Integrity].  f. The endpoint vendor SHOULD use an extensible system to enable adding support for  measuring option ROMs, etc.  g. The endpoint SHALL store BIMs in an RTS.  h. The endpoint vendor SHOULD make raw BIOS configuration data available for reporting  and SHOULD have a means of interpretation of that data available.  3. Measurement Log  a. BIOS functions SHALL record in an SML measurement and event extensions into the CIMR  and DIMR.  b. BIOS functions SHOULD record in an SML measurement and event extensions into the  PIMR.  c. BIOS functions SHALL use a standardized format, such as [TCG-ConvBiosSpec], when  recording BIM and other BIOS-related events in an SML.  d. BIOS SHALL ensure the proper handoff of the SML to the post-boot environment.  4. Measurement Support  a. The OS vendor SHALL support a standard application programming interface (API) for  collecting measurements.  b. The endpoint, OS, and application vendors SHALL support an RTR for collecting and  reporting BIMs.  3.2.2.5 Relevant Standards and Specifications  There are several standards of note related to these requirements. The [NIST-SP800-147] specification  spells out the necessary conditions for achieving and maintaining an immutable BIOS boot block upon  which an RTM depends. The [TCG-ConvBiosSpec] specification defines for which BIOS components the  RTM (i.e., BIOS) should take measurements and store them in the RTS (e.g., TPM). The TCG EFI  Platform Specification Version 1.20 Revision 1.0 [TCG-EFI] specifies the Extensible Firmware Interface  (EFI) components that the RTM, or by extension the chain of trust within the EFI, should measure and  store in the RTS (e.g., TPM). Finally, the TCG Infrastructure Working Group Reference Manifest  Schema Specification Version 1.0 [TCG-Manifest] specifies the format which vendors can use to report  BIOS integrity golden measurements, endpoint measurements, and BIOS integrity measurement  attributes.  3.3 BIOS Integrity Reporting  Reporting of the BIOS integrity values stored in the RTS is performed by an Endpoint Reporting Agent.  3.3.1 Endpoint Reporting Agent  The endpoint RTR and the Reporting Agent anchored in the RTR are responsible for extracting the  measurements stored in the IMRs of the RTS. It is critical that the RTR and the Reporting Agent apply  BIOS INTEGRITY MEASUREMENT GUIDELINES (DRAFT)  20  integrity and non-repudiation protections on the data so that subsequent agents cannot alter or replace the  data without detection by the MAA. In addition, unambiguous identity is an important property to apply  to the data so that the MAA knows the source of the data. Typically a signature over the data using a key  recognized by the MAA is sufficient to satisfy the integrity, non-repudiation, and unambiguous identity  goals.  In addition the Reporting Agent is responsible for supplying the SML corresponding to the IMR data. It is  desirable to identify the components measured based on a component ID that uniquely identifies the  manufacturer, model, and version, thus allowing the MAA to compare the measurements against its  golden measurements.  The endpoint Reporting Agent is given a nonce which originates in the MAA and is passed to it through  the Transmission Agent and Collection Agent. It then passes this nonce to the RTR and receives back a  signature over the nonce together with the hash representation of the measurements stored in the RTS. It  also obtains the SML and puts the two together in a standard format. This report must eventually be  readable by an MAA. Therefore  1. The defined report format SHALL use [TCG-Integrity].  2. The report SHOULD contain a copy of the BIOS configuration, in an industry standard format, if  the ability to parse and determine the acceptability of the configuration is desired.  In addition to the above guidance and the standards listed throughout Section 3.3, the requirements below  in Section 3.3.2 apply to the BIOS measurement reports that are provided to the Verification Agent in the  MAA.  3.3.2 Security Guidelines for the Reporting Protocol  1. BIOS reporting mechanisms MAY prepare and issue a BIOS integrity report to an authenticated  MAA upon any of the following conditions:  a. When a change was made to the BIOS configuration  b. When a change was made to the BIOS software  c. When a local port was used to access the BIOS or its configuration  d. When a BIOS error condition has been generated  e. Upon connection to a network controlled by an authenticated MAA.  2. BIOS reporting mechanisms MAY support the ability to configure specific events to trigger  reports of BIOS integrity measurements.  3. Report requests MAY be initiated by either the reporter or the receiver of the report. The  following requirements apply to requests that are initiated by either side:  a. Mechanisms SHALL be capable of providing provably fresh BIOS reports that are sent to the  MAA.  b. The report SHOULD include a reference to the formatting standard/schema used for the  report.  c. The report format SHOULD include a version field that can be updated over time as the  report format gets extended or otherwise changes.  d. All requests to issue or provide a report from an unauthenticated entity SHOULD be ignored.  BIOS INTEGRITY MEASUREMENT GUIDELINES (DRAFT)  21  e. Requests to provide or issue a report MAY contain a priority that indicates the urgency of the  request.  f. Response timeframes related to requests MAY be configurable by the licensed user based on  priority.  3.3.3 Relevant Standards and Specifications  BIOS measurements need to be provided in a standard schema so that they can be used and acted upon by  the receiving entity based on policy. Therefore, the following standards and guidance should be employed  for establishing a trust model for reporting and for providing standard reporting formats and transport for  BIOS measurements.  The TCG Infrastructure Working Group Integrity Report Schema Specification [TCG-Integrity] defines  the structure with which integrity information is communicated between entities. The TCG Trusted  Network Connect (TNC) Working Group IF-M Specification [TCG-IF-M] defines a protocol for an MAA  to request measurements from an endpoint, and for the endpoint to provide those measurements to the  MAA.  The TCG Trusted Network Connect Architecture for Interoperability specification [TCG-ARCH-INTER]  describes an open solution architecture that enables network operators to enforce policies regarding the  security state of endpoints in order to determine whether to grant access to a requested network  infrastructure. Endpoint integrity policies may involve integrity parameters spanning a range of system  components (hardware, firmware, software, and application settings), and may or may not include  evidence of a TPM. This security assessment of each endpoint is performed using a set of asserted  integrity measurements covering aspects of the operational environment of the endpoint. IF-M, IF- TNCCS, and IF-T are key TNC protocols for transmitting measurements from an endpoint to an MAA.  NIST IR 7802 [NIST-IR-7802] provides recommendations on how to use existing specifications to  represent signatures, hashes, key information, and identity information in the context of an XML  document within the security automation domain. NIST IR 7694 [NIST-IR-7694] describes the Asset  Reporting Format (ARF), a data model for expressing the transport format of information about assets  and the relationships between assets and reports. The standardized data model facilitates the reporting,  correlating, and fusing of asset information throughout and between organizations. NIST SP 800-126  [NIST-SP800-126] defines the Security Content Automation Protocol (SCAP), a suite of specifications  that standardize the format and nomenclature by which security software products communicate security  content, particularly software flaw and security configuration information. SCAP is a multi-purpose  protocol that supports automated configuration, vulnerability, and patch checking, technical control  compliance activities, and security measurement.  The DMTF’s System Management BIOS (SMBIOS) Reference Specification [DMTF-SMBIOS]  addresses how motherboard and system vendors present management information about their products in  a standard format by extending the BIOS interface on x86 architecture systems. This specification is  intended to provide enough information that BIOS developers may implement the necessary extensions to  allow the hardware on their products and other system-related information to be accurately determined by  users of the defined interfaces. In addition, in cases where the implementer has provided write access to  non-volatile storage on the system, some information may be updated by management applications after a  system is deployed in the field to record data that persists between system starts. The specification is also  intended to provide enough information for developers of management instrumentation to develop generic  routines for translating from SMBIOS format to the format used by their chosen management technology,  whether it is a DMTF technology like DMI or CIM, or another technology. To support this translation for  DMTF technologies, sections of this specification describe the DMI groups and CIM classes intended to  BIOS INTEGRITY MEASUREMENT GUIDELINES (DRAFT)  22  convey the information retrieved from an SMBIOS-compatible system through the interfaces described in  the document.  Finally, the TCG Attestation PTS Protocol: Binding to TNC IF-M specification [TCG-Att-PTS] and the  TCG Infrastructure Working Group Integrity Report Schema Specification [TCG-Integrity] define how to  use IF to request and send Integrity Reports. They also adds the means to send the random nonce and  support TLV-based integrity report data.  3.4 BIOS Integrity Measurement Collection and Transmission  3.4.1 Overview of Measurement Collection and Transmission  BIMs are collected and placed in a standard format by the Collection Agent, then transmitted from the  endpoint to the MAA by a Transmission Agent. This section describes the requirements that must be met  by the Collection Agent and Transmission Agent.  Secure transmission of BIMs ensures that measurements are not modified, disclosed, or forged in transit  by malicious parties. Further, proper selection of transmission protocols should ensure maximum  interoperability, freshness, and efficiency. In addition, cryptographic protection of the integrity and source  authentication of measurements starting at the RTR ensures that even if the Collection Agent,  Transmission Agent, or other software becomes compromised, the measurements cannot be falsified.  3.4.2 Security Guidelines for Measurement Collection and Transmission  The Transmission Agent SHALL securely transmit measurements of BIOS integrity from endpoints to the  MAA, as follows:  1. All reporting sessions SHALL:  a. have the ability to provide confidentiality protection.  b. provide integrity protection and freshness.  c. authenticate the MAA.  d. provide authentication of endpoint identities.  2. The Transmission Agent:  a. SHALL permit measurements to be integrity protected all the way from the RTR to the  verifying component.  b. SHOULD support a variety of different services such as continuous monitoring, network  access control, and application-layer integrity monitoring  c. SHOULD ensure the resulting system is inexpensive, unobtrusive, high performance, and  secure (although higher levels of security may require higher levels of cost)  3. Collection Agents and Transmission Agents on endpoints SHOULD support open standards that  enable interoperability among many different kinds of endpoints and MAAs over many different  forms of communications media, to the extent that such standards are available.  3.4.3 Relevant Standards and Specifications  There are several standards relevant to the above requirements. The PA-TNC specification [IETF-RFC- 5792] is equivalent to TCG's IF-M 1.0 [TCG-IF-M]; it describes a standard structure for requesting and  BIOS INTEGRITY MEASUREMENT GUIDELINES (DRAFT)  23  transmitting integrity measurements. The PB-TNC specification [IETF-RFC-5793] is equivalent to TCG's  IF-TNCCS 2.0. It describes a standard protocol for conducting an integrity measurement exchange. The  TCG Trusted Network Connect TNC IF-T: Binding to TLS specification [TCG-IF-T-TLS] describes how  an integrity measurement exchange is transmitted over the TLS protocol, after network connectivity has  been established. The TCG Trusted Network Connect TNC IF-T: Protocol Bindings for Tunneled EAP  Methods specification [TCG-IF-T-EAP] describes how an integrity measurement exchange is transmitted  over EAP, before network connectivity has been established. Finally, the TCG Attestation PTS Protocol:  Binding to TNC IF-M specification [TCG-Att-PTS] defines how to use IF to request and send Integrity  Reports. It also adds the means to send the random nonce and support TLV-based integrity report data.  3.5 Measurement Assessment Authority  3.5.1 Overview  The MAA is responsible for several things. It transmits a nonce to the client Transmission Agent to  guarantee it will receive fresh measurements back from the client. It receives the transmission from the  client Transmission Agent in response, which will consist of a report detailing the BIMs together with a  signature over the nonce and a set of hashes which together prove the integrity of that report.  When these items are reliably and robustly reported, it allows an enterprise management system to  accurately determine the state of the security relevant BIOS configuration items on the system. With this  information, the MAA can report on and act upon the specific configuration items with which the  organization is concerned. It is not forced to act only upon the fact that a change in some unspecified  configuration item has caused the overall measurement to deviate from its last recorded value, when the  configuration item that changed may not even be security relevant. It should be possible for the  administrative component of the BIOS reporting mechanism to select which attributes are reported. For  individual BIOS configuration items, a security administrator can be expected to provide the desired  values for items which are of concern to the organization.  Collected and reported BIOS measurements can be used to make an access decision, either through  quarantine, denial of access to network resources or remediation. It also provides situational awareness of  one aspect of a network’s security posture based on the integrity of the devices on the network. The  adoption of TCG-compliant BIOS by endpoint vendors will provide some of the necessary infrastructure  to reliably establish, measure, and report the state of the BIOS on endpoints. At a minimum, the MAA has  to be able to provide the state of the system either for display to an IT administrator or to an automated  access/enforcement point. Information collected may be reported to a policy enforcement/decision point  for some form of remediation or response, or may be fed to visualization capabilities that provide a  network operator or analyst with an aggregated and normalized view of the integrity of the assets on a  network. Visualization/situational awareness capabilities exist today that collect other device  measurements; the addition of BIOS integrity measurements is a natural and straightforward extension.  The BIOS may be subject to bit rot, or modifications where the bits of the BIOS contents may change  spuriously as a result of random faults as determined by the physical properties of the BIOS storage  device hardware. Depending on the BIOS storage device hardware, those spurious modifications may  happen with some frequency in very large installations; as a result, unexpected BIOS measurements may  be reported potentially weekly or daily. To avoid the assumption that all unexpected measurements are  due to bit rot, and to facilitate correct decisions and appropriate actions by operators, the MAA MAY  provide mechanisms that allow assessing whether measurement results are likely due to bit rot.  BIOS INTEGRITY MEASUREMENT GUIDELINES (DRAFT)  24  3.5.2 Security Guidelines for the MAA  1. The MAA SHALL be capable of storing expected values (golden measurements).  2. The MAA SHALL be capable of comparing new reported values against expected values and/or  previously reported (last known) measurements.  3. The MAA SHALL be capable of storing reported values.  4. MAAs SHALL support open standards that enable interoperability among many different kinds  of endpoints and MAAs over many different forms of communications media, to the extent that  such standards are available.  5. The MAA MAY be capable of providing an assessment of the likelihood that an unexpected,  anomalous measurement is the result of a bit rot, if provided with the contents of the BIOS that  generated the anomalous measurement as well as the BIOS contents for which golden  measurements exist.  3.6 Remediation Activities  Remediation is the process of correcting a problem with a computing system. In the context of BIOS  security, remediation refers to actions such as upgrading an outdated BIOS to a known-good version and  reconfiguring a BIOS to meet an organization’s security requirements. There are often several options for  the processes used to remediate a BIOS security problem. The appropriate process option or options for  each case may vary according to several factors, including the type of problem (BIOS update,  configuration change, etc.), the nature of the problem (intentional attack versus accidental change), the  relative importance of the system, and the organization’s incident handling policies and practices. Each  organization needs to determine which factors are relevant for their environment and determine how to  incorporate them into remediation activities. Further discussion of this is outside the scope of this  publication.  The remediation discussion in this section does not take into account incident handling and forensic  activities, which are outside the scope of this publication. See NIST SP 800-61 for additional information  on incident handling and NIST SP 800-86 for general forensic guidelines.  3.6.1 Quarantine Strategies  Quarantine is the process of virtually “moving” a compromised system from a position of broad network  and resource access (or potential access, in the case of a system being joined to a network) to a pool of  networked systems whose access is restricted, so that the target system can “do no harm” before  remediation is completed. Full quarantine restricts all network access, while partial quarantine allows the  system to access some parts of the network, but not more sensitive regions.  Quarantine is intended to be a short-term state. If mitigation is successful, typically the quarantine ends  and the system is allowed its regular network access. If mitigation is not successful, it may be appropriate  to completely remove the system from service so that an administrator can manually handle the  mitigation.  BIM-supporting products can leverage existing standards to support quarantining. The TCG Trusted  Network Connect IF-PEP [TCG-IF-PEP] can be used to send commands between the MAA and the  enforcement point to support full or partial quarantining. RFC 3576, Dynamic Authorization Extensions  to Remote Authentication Dial In User Service [IETF-RFC-3576], can be used to support dynamic  BIOS INTEGRITY MEASUREMENT GUIDELINES (DRAFT)  25  authorization, allowing an MAA and enforcement point to retest an endpoint at a later time and  potentially take remedial action, including quarantining the system.  3.6.2 Remediation Automation  Organizations may have several options for partially or fully automating their BIOS remediation actions.  Different options are appropriate for different situations and environments. For example, one organization  may want their BIOS remediation to be completely driven by external systems (e.g., enterprise network  and system management), while another organization may want remediation to be completely self- contained in the product, and to have remediation actions performed as soon as possible using fully  automated means. There are many approaches between these extremes, with most manufacturers shipping  their products with a default automated remediation strategy. Possible strategies include the following:  1. Fully automated, self-contained. In the case of some systems, there may be specialized trusted  hardware out of band to the normal system that can provide full remediation to the system in the  event of a compromise.  2. Fully automated, externally driven. Most enterprises and large organizations will employ server- based remediation on systems that will allow remote remediation to fix problems. Full reboot will  likely be necessary in this case as software by itself is generally not trustable.  3. Partially automated requiring physical operator intervention. For example, if remediation  software is compromised, it may be necessary to reboot the system from a secondary source, such  as a CD, to employ trusted remediation client software. In any event, the system’s operator can be  trusted to be involved in the remediation, rather than requiring a trusted IT representative to do it.  4. Partially automated requiring remote owner intervention. In this case an IT representative may  have to be dispatched to work on the system rather than its operator.  Products may implement stages of remediation, which include fallback strategies, in the event that initial  remediations are unsuccessful. Each stage may be fully automated, may be customer configurable, or may  allow for manual intervention. Ordering of remediation stages may similarly be automated or customer  configurable. In staged linear remediation, there is a single path of predetermined remediation paths; in  staged branching remediation, there is a flexible set of remediation path choice points, based on one or  more variable inputs. An example of this would be a server-based remediation that a reboot shows was  not successful due to a compromise of the client-based remediation software. At this point, the client can  be rebooted to a preboot execution environment (PXE) server, which can then be used to run known-good  client-based remediation software, or a technician can be dispatched to the system to remediate it locally.  The PA-TNC specification [IETF-RFC-5792], equivalent to TCG's IF-M 1.0 [TCG-IF-M], can support  partially automated remediation that requires physical user intervention on the client. These standards  support sending Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs), such as a web address, or human readable strings  from the MAA to the endpoint, to assist the user-driven remediation activity.  The NIST SCAP specifications can also support fully or partially automated remediation activities. Draft  NISTIR 7670, Proposed Open Specifications for Enterprise Security Remediation [NIST-IR-7670],  examines use cases for enterprise remediation, identifies high-level requirements for these use cases, and  proposes a set of emerging specifications that address those requirements.  BIOS INTEGRITY MEASUREMENT GUIDELINES (DRAFT)  26  3.6.3 Restoration Options  There are several possible options for restoring the BIOS software or configuration to a “known good  state”, including the following:  1. Restoration to manufacturer default configuration  2. Restoration to customer default configuration for general use  3. Restoration to customer default operational configuration for a specific use  4. Restoration to last known good configuration  5. Force the system into a non-operational state (e.g., quarantined, removed from service)  Another consideration for restoration is the policy for handling a system’s non-volatile data. Possible  options include:  1. No backup  2. Partial backup  3. Full backup  4. Application gating strategy – This strategy can be applied when the compromise is localized to a  particular BIOS service that can be selectively disabled.  5. In the event that a particular service (such as a low-level manageability interface) has been  compromised, it may be possible to securely turn off the service rather than re-flash the entire  BIOS.  3.6.4 Verification Options  After a BIOS has been remediated, an organization may choose to verify its integrity. This usually  involves rebooting the system and putting it through its normal test sequence, ensuring that its integrity is  restored before giving the system access to network resources. Alternately, an organization may choose to  allow systems to return to operation without going through a standard retest. In this case the remediation  strategy is trusted at least as much as the trusted measurement that normally takes place upon boot.

BIOS INTEGRITY MEASUREMENT GUIDELINES (DRAFT)  31  Appendix B—Glossary and Abbreviations  This portion of the appendix defines terms used in this document.  Attribute: A property of RoTs used by an assessor to determine how much trust to place in them.  BIOS Code Integrity Measurement Register (CIMR): A register that contains either the cryptographic  hash of all the static BIOS code on the endpoint or a composite of hashes of all the BIOS components that  make up the BIOS code space.  BIOS Data Integrity Measurement Register (DIMR): A register that contains either the cryptographic  hash of all the dynamic BIOS configuration data on the endpoint or a composite of hashes of all the BIOS  components that make up the BIOS configuration data space.  BIOS Privacy Integrity Measurement Register (PIMR): A register that contains a composite of hashes  of all BIOS privacy sensitive data.  BIOS integrity measurement generation: The act of creating hashes of BIOS components and filling  static and dynamic BIOS configuration registers with those hashes.  Bit rot: Modifications to BIOS storage caused by random physical processes.  Collection: Both the act of measuring the BIOS integrity of an endpoint and the process of gathering the  resulting measurements so that they can be transmitted from the endpoint.  Dynamic BIOS Components: Those portions of the BIOS which the user may change without assistance  from either the BIOS vendor or the system vendor. This is often referred to as BIOS configuration data.  Endpoint: A system whose BIOS integrity is being measured. An endpoint can be a laptop, a server, a  virtualized environment, a service, etc.  Golden measurements: A trusted set of integrity measurements for a BIOS and its configuration data.  These measurements are usually provided from a trusted party, such as the OEM of the endpoint, or they  are taken by system administrators during the initial provisioning of a device. The SHA-2 hash of BIOS  signed by an OEM would be an example of a golden BIOS measurement. A golden BIOS measurement  does not confer information regarding the presence or absence of malicious properties. It does aid in the  quick, authentic, non-reputable identification of an object.  Integrity measurement: A compact representation of a binary code and/or data. In the context of BIOS  integrity measurement, this is typically represented as a cryptographic hash of binary code and data, often  cryptographically signed to preserve authenticity and non-repudiation.  Known-good state: When the BIOS has been verified as being in an acceptable state. An example of this  state is when a digital signature of the loaded BIOS verifies as matching the manufacturer’s current  version.  Measurement Assessment Authority (MAA): An agent running on behalf of IT management which  receives measurements from clients, checks the signature of those measurements, assesses the quality of  the measurements by comparing them with golden measurements, may further analyze measurements (to  determine what changes have been made to BIOS integrity measurements if the measurements do not  match golden measurements), and then either displays the results to IT management or acts as a proxy for  IT management to automatically take preset action when the measurements are not expected values.  Management controller: In a server environment, there is often a supervisory processor or controller that  “manages” the primary processors running applications. This management controller is separate from the  primary processors and can perform various operations on them or on their behalf.  BIOS INTEGRITY MEASUREMENT GUIDELINES (DRAFT)  32  Primary processor: One of possibly several processors (cores) that is available to run applications on a  system.  Remediation: The process of correcting a problem with a computing system.  Root of Trust (RoT): A component (software, hardware, or hybrid) and a computing engine that  constitute a set of unconditionally trusted functions. An RoT must always behave in an expected manner  because its misbehavior cannot be detected.  Root of Trust for Measurement (RTM): A computing engine capable of making inherently reliable  integrity measurements. The RTM is the root of the chain of transitive trust for subsequent measurement  agents.  Root of Trust for Reporting (RTR): A computing engine capable of reliably reporting information  provided by the RTM and its measurement agent(s) or held by the RTS.  Root of Trust for Storage (RTS): A computing engine capable of maintaining a tamper-evident  summary of integrity measurement values and the sequence of those measurements.  Static BIOS components – Those portions of the BIOS which the user may change, usually with  assistance either from the BIOS vendor or the system vendor. This is often referred to as BIOS code.

BIOS INTEGRITY MEASUREMENT GUIDELINES (DRAFT)  36  Appendix D—Options for Implementing Roots of Trust  The basis of BIOS integrity guarantees are RoTs that are founded on the properties of one or more  hardware mechanisms. Some of these RoT themselves assume that the requirements and  recommendations in [NIST-SP800-147] are met. Some of the most relevant hardware mechanisms for  RoTs are enumerated below. (This list is not comprehensive.)  D.1 Startup Logic of the CPU and Chipset  BIOS integrity depends on the behavior of the CPU being well defined at startup, and in particular on the  chipset correctly mapping the BIOS storage device and the CPU executing the correct initial BIOS  instruction, as expected, after a reset. This hardware mechanism is the basis for boot-time RTMs, but may  be less relevant for RTMs based on “late-launch” mechanisms or runtime re-initialization of the CPU.  D.2 UEFI Power-On SEC Security Phase  The Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI) provides a supplement and partial replacement for  functions previously entirely handled by BIOS. The UEFI Power-on SEC security phase may provide an  RoT that may be able to reliably invoke software measurement agents in the UEFI in a way that can be  used to implement an RTM for BIOS integrity. This may require compliance with [NIST-SP800-147].  D.3 Access-Controlled Regions of the BIOS Storage Device  The integrity of the BIOS and of BIOS measurements may be based on hardware access control  mechanisms for the BIOS storage device itself. Such access control can be enforced through set-until- reboot latches that prevent reads or writes to the BIOS storage device. Such latches remain set until the  next hardware reset and can be locked down, for example, by the BIOS itself, during early stages of the  boot. The latches may be implemented, for example, through hardware mechanisms in either the BIOS  storage device itself or in the CPU chipset. These mechanisms may be used to form the basis of  compliance with [NIST-SP800-147].  Access-controlled regions of the BIOS storage device supported by [NIST-SP800-147] compliant  architectures can also serve as a basis for RTSs or RTRs. For example, the BIOS may measure itself  during initialization and place the measurement results in a readable, but write-protected-until-hardware- reset BIOS storage region. The BIOS can also create reports using a cryptographic key stored within a  region of the BIOS storage that is subsequently rendered inaccessible until the next hardware reset, before  the BIOS passes control to the OS or boot loader. To guarantee freshness, reports can make use of nonces  stored in volatile areas of the BIOS during the previous OS execution.  D.3.1 Static Immutable BIOS Boot Block  A static immutable BIOS Boot Block (or Initial BIOS code region) can serve a basis for BIOS integrity  RTMs, e.g., by measuring the contents of the relevant BIOS storage device and by setting its access- control latches. By being built on an immutable BIOS boot block, such an RTM could possibly provide  Mutable State Tolerance, as defined in Section 3.1 even without complying with [NIST-SP800-147].  D.4 Isolated CPU Execution Modes and Access-Controlled Memory  Several CPU execution modes and memory access-control features may form RoTs for BIOS integrity  and for BIOS measurements. By their nature, these implementations cannot provide Memory Disclosure  Tolerance, as defined in Section 3.1.  BIOS INTEGRITY MEASUREMENT GUIDELINES (DRAFT)  37  With a [NIST-SP800-147] architecture, the SMM execution mode of the CPU is a potential RoT that can  be the basis for isolated, stateful mechanisms that are controlled and initialized by the BIOS at boot time,  but are available during the machine's entire execution, until the next reboot. In some cases, SMM code  can have greater access to the BIOS storage device than the OS kernel. SMM mode on its own is not a  basis for RTMs. However, SMM mode can build on a BIOS-based RTM and serve to (a) perform runtime  measurements of the contents and the relevant access-control latch settings of the BIOS storage device,  (b) implement an RTS by placing measurement results in SMRAM, or (c) implement an RTR, for  example by having the BIOS initialize SMRAM with a private cryptographic key, used to sign  measurement reports, and which is accessible nowhere else but from SMM mode after BIOS initialization  has finished.  As outlined in the TCG specifications, some CPUs provide support for so-called dynamic RoTs, where  the CPU is reinitialized into a known-good state. In combination with a TPM, such “late-launch” CPU  execution modes can be the basis for all necessary RoTs. However, notably, such dynamic measurement  may not be able to establish the integrity of the BIOS or BIOS settings at past or future hardware resets;  to establish such boot-time guarantees, BIOS integrity MUST be protected using mechanisms such as  outlined in [NIST-SP800-147].  D.5 Supervisor CPU Execution Modes and Supervisor-Only Memory  A traditional role of privileged, kernel-mode code in hypervisors or operating systems is protection of  system devices, such as the BIOS. A hypervisor or an OS kernel is nearly always protected through  hardware-supported memory mechanisms, and the kernel runs in a supervisor execution mode with its  own private memory. In principle, those hardware mechanisms can be the RoT for implementing BIOS  integrity RTMs, RTSs, and RTRs, with the hypervisor or OS protecting its own integrity, that of the  BIOS, and that of reported measurements, particularly assuming a [NIST-SP800-147] architecture. Due to  their size and complexity, such hypervisor or OS-supported RoTs are likely to provide few guarantees,  and minimal assurance, at least for standard hypervisors or OSs.  D.6 Trusted Platform Modules  TPMs can serve as a basis for RTSs and RTRs. When combined with static immutable BIOS boot blocks  (as dictated by the TCG specifications, and as in Section D.3), TPMs can provide for both Mutable State  Tolerance and Memory Disclosure Tolerance, as defined in Section 3.1.  D.7 Proprietary RoTs  BIOS integrity protection and measurement mechanisms can be implemented by custom logic in the  CPU, CPU chipsets, and/or the BIOS storage device. Such custom logic may be used to implement any  RoTs, although few (if any) such implementations are currently available for commodity client hardware  platforms.  Examples of such RoTs might include BIOS storage devices that are either packaged with or closely  communicate with an embedded, separate microcontroller that is provisioned with a private key and  private storage. If properly implemented, such an RoT can be used to implement mechanisms that provide  Mutable State Tolerance and Memory Disclosure Tolerance, as defined in Section 3.1.  BIOS INTEGRITY MEASUREMENT GUIDELINES (DRAFT)  38  Appendix E—Example Implementation Possibilities  Appendix E enumerates some possibilities for the implementation of BIOS integrity measurements, using  commonly available mechanisms. Some examples of mechanisms not considered here are management  controllers (e.g., as the embedded management engine in Intel’s Sandy Bridge and successor chipsets), as  well as microcontrollers embedded into BIOS storage devices.  E.1 Example 1 - Possible implementation using a high-assurance kernel or hypervisor  In this example implementation, a trusted supervisor (such as a trustworthy hypervisor or high-assurance  separation kernel) is used to create the necessary RoTs for BIOS integrity measurements, based on the  CPU startup logic (Section E.1) and supervisor execution modes (Section E.4, item 3) hardware RoTs.  The supervisor is responsible for inductively protecting the RoTs as well as ensuring the integrity of the  BIOS and its settings during operation and across updates.  1. At a machine reset, the CPU starts executing the first instruction of the BIOS out of the BIOS  storage device (e.g., flash chip).  2. The BIOS completes initialization and turns control directly over to a trusted supervisor, or to a  trusted bootloader which finds and loads the trusted supervisor.  3. The trusted supervisor is responsible for implementing the [NIST-SP800-147] guidelines and for  completely mediating and controlling access to the machine configuration, including the  configuration of the CPU startup logic and the BIOS contents and settings, as well as the  configuration of the boot storage device containing the bootloader and the code and configuration  of the supervisor itself.  4. The trusted supervisor also forms the RTM, RTS, and RTR for BIOS integrity measurements, and  must protect stored measurement results (e.g., as part of the protected state on the boot storage  device) and allow those results to be provably freshly reported (e.g., so they cannot be spoofed or  replayed). For this purpose, the supervisor may make use of secret or private keys, for example  stored in the BIOS or boot storage devices.  5. Whether on demand, on boot, or at time of BIOS upgrade, the supervisor can prepare BIM reports  by measuring such things as (a) all BIOS code and (b) all critical BIOS data, such as non-writable  configuration settings, and (c) the NVRAM configuration data.  6. It is the responsibility of the BIOS and the supervisor to ensure that the supervisor (and only the  supervisor) will again be booted after the next hardware reset. The BIOS must protect itself and  any stored RTR cryptographic keys (e.g., by destroying those keys), unless the BIOS can  establish that control will pass to a verified copy of the trusted supervisor after BIOS initialization  finishes.  The above implementation provides neither the Mutable State Tolerance nor Memory Disclosure  Tolerance properties described in Section 3.1.  E.2  Example 2 - Possible implementation using latch-based mechanisms  In this example implementation, which assumes a [NIST-SP800-147] architecture, a combination of  BIOS startup code and SMM code installed by the BIOS at startup is used to create the necessary RoTs  for BIOS integrity measurements, based on the CPU startup logic (Section D.1), SMM execution mode  (Section D.4), and BIOS storage device access control (Section D.3) hardware RoTs. The BIOS itself and  BIOS INTEGRITY MEASUREMENT GUIDELINES (DRAFT)  39  its SMM code is responsible for inductively protecting the RoTs as well as ensuring the integrity of the  BIOS and its settings during operation and across updates.  1. At a machine reset, the CPU starts executing the first instruction of the BIOS out of the BIOS  storage device (e.g., flash chip).  2. To implement the [NIST-SP800-147] guidelines the BIOS first checks if a valid, signed BIOS  upgrade is available in accessible storage (e.g., on disk, in free space in the BIOS flash chip, or in  an inserted USB key). Finding no upgrade is needed, the BIOS may check its own integrity; this  should only be needed to guard against bit rot, since BIOS integrity is inductively preserved  through runtime write-protection.  3. The BIOS then sets up SMM mode and copies a BIOS-specific private key into SMRAM. The  BIOS also makes a copy of all its BIOS/NVRAM configuration data to SMRAM. SMM code is  responsible for runtime BIOS measurements and the key signs BIM results.  4. The BIOS then programs locked-until-machine-reset latches to (a) make non-writable all BIOS  code and all critical data, such as non-writable configuration settings, and (b) make inaccessible,  i.e., non-readable and non-writable, the BIOS flash region containing the BIOS-specific private  key.  5. The BIOS turns control over to the bootloader, which finds and loads an OS.  6. At runtime, a nonce is provided to create a report on a BIM attribute, such as, for instance, (a) the  BIOS code bytes in the BIOS flash chip, (b) the current or boot-time NVRAM configuration, (c)  the state of the locked-until-machine-reset latches and related machine control areas, etc.  7. SMM code is invoked, via one or more SMIs, and the SMM code measures the asked for  attribute, such as, for (c) by querying the control registers in the BIOS flash chip itself and in the  chipset (e.g., the southbridge).  8. The SMM code combines its measurements with the nonce into a message digest, and signs that  digest with the BIOS-specific private key.  The above implementation provides neither the Mutable State Tolerance nor Memory Disclosure  Tolerance properties described in Section 3.1.  E.3  Example 3 - Possible implementation using TPM-based mechanisms  In this example implementation, common in enterprise clients today, a combination of BIOS startup code  and the TCG-specified TPM is used to create the necessary RoTs for BIOS integrity measurements, based  on the CPU startup logic (Section D.1), TPM (Section D.5), and BIOS storage-device access control  (Section D.3) hardware RoTs. The BIOS itself is responsible for inductively protecting the Software  Measurement Agents as well as ensuring the integrity of the BIOS and its settings during operation and  across updates.  1. At a machine reset, the CPU starts executing the first instruction of an immutable BIOS boot  block out of the BIOS storage device, and the TPM registers are set to known values.  2. The immutable BIOS boot block measures (a) all BIOS code and (b) all critical BIOS data, such  as non-writable configuration settings, and (c) the NVRAM configuration data and extends these  measurements into separate PCRs on the TPM. The TPM is responsible for storing measurements  and reporting BIM results, and the TPM key is used to sign BIM results.  3. The BIOS boot block turns control over to code resident in the measured, mutable parts of the  BIOS storage device, which in turn passes control to the bootloader to find and load an OS. Note  BIOS INTEGRITY MEASUREMENT GUIDELINES (DRAFT)  40  that this implementation does NOT meet [NIST-SP800-147], since no attempt is made to  establish BIOS code integrity, e.g., by write-protecting code regions in the BIOS storage device.  4. At runtime, a nonce is provided to create a report on a BIM attribute, such as, for instance, (a) the  BIOS code hash, (b) the boot-time NVRAM configuration, (c) the state of the locked-until- machine-reset latches and related machine control areas, etc.  5. A PCR register in the TPM is combined with the nonce, and signed by the TPM-resident key, to  create a report on, for example, the BIOS code and configuration present at boot time.  E.4  Example 4 - Possible implementation using CPU-late-launch-based mechanisms  In this example implementation, a combination of BIOS startup code and the TCG-compliant CPU late- launch is used to create the necessary RoTs for BIOS integrity measurements, based on the CPU startup  logic (Section D.1), TPM (Section D.5), and runtime re-initialized CPU execution mode (Section D.4)  hardware RoTs. The hardware itself is responsible for inductively protecting the RoTs, while the integrity  of the BIOS and its settings during operation and across updates may be protected via various software  means—or even not protected at all.  1. At a machine reset, the CPU starts executing the first instruction of the BIOS out of the BIOS  storage device.  2. A flaw in the implementation of [NIST-SP800-147] guidelines may have allowed the BIOS to be  corrupted. However, the late-launch facilities allow BIOS integrity to be measured in a way that  will reveal this corruption, potentially revealing an attack.  3. The BIOS turns control over to the bootloader, which finds and loads an OS.  4. At runtime, a nonce is provided to create a report on a BIM attribute, such as, for instance, (a) the  BIOS code hash, (b) the NVRAM configuration, (c) the state of the locked-until-machine-reset  latches and related machine control areas, etc.  5. The CPU enters a clean, well-defined environment through late-launch facilities, with known,  well-defined values in some TPM registers.  6. The late-launch environment measures such things as (a) all BIOS code and (b) all critical BIOS  data, such as non-writable configuration settings, and (c) the NVRAM configuration data and  writes to well-defined, separate PCRs on the TPM. The TPM is responsible for storing  measurements and reporting BIM results, and the TPM key is used to sign BIM results.  7. A PCR register in the TPM is combined with the nonce, and signed by the TPM-resident key, to  create a report on, for example, the BIOS code present at boot time.  2013-04-25T15:29:02-0400  CSRC Webmaster +serialNumber=0001",

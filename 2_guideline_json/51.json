This  publication provides agencies with recommended security requirements for protecting the  confidentiality of CUI when the information is resident in nonfederal systems and organizations,  when the nonfederal organization is not collecting or maintaining information on behalf of a  federal agency or using or operating a system on behalf of an agency, and where there are no  specific safeguarding requirements for protecting the confidentiality of CUI prescribed by the  authorizing law, regulation, or governmentwide policy for the CUI category listed in the CUI  Registry. The requirements apply to components of nonfederal systems that process, store, or  transmit CUI or that provide protection for such components. The security requirements are  intended for use by federal agencies in contractual vehicles or other agreements established  between those agencies and nonfederal organizations.

The authors also wish to thank  the NIST technical editing and production staff – Jim Foti, Jeff Brewer, and Isabel Van Wyk –  for their outstanding support in preparing this document for publication and Kelley Dempsey for  the initial research and development of the technical content used in the prototype CUI overlay.  Historical Contributions  The authors also wish to acknowledge the following organizations and individuals for their  historic contributions to this publication:  Organizations: National Archives and Records Administration, Department of Defense  Individuals: Carol Bales, Matthew Barrett, Jon Boyens, Devin Casey, Christian Enloe, Gary  Guissanie, Peggy Himes, Robert Glenn, Elizabeth Lennon, Vicki Michetti, Dorian Pappas, Karen  Quigg, Mark Riddle, Matthew Scholl, Mary Thomas, Murugiah Souppaya, Patricia Toth, and  Patrick Viscuso  NIST SP 800-171r3 ipd (Initial Public Draft)  Protecting Controlled Unclassified Information  May 2023  1  Introduction  1  Executive Order (EO) 13556 [1] established a governmentwide program to standardize the way 2  the executive branch handles Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI).1 EO 13556 required 3  that the CUI program emphasize openness, transparency, and uniformity of governmentwide 4  practices and that the program implementation take place in a manner consistent with Office of 5  Management and Budget (OMB) policies and National Institute of Standards and Technology 6  (NIST) standards and guidelines. As the CUI program Executive Agent, the National Archives 7  and Records Administration (NARA) provides information, guidance, policy, and requirements 8  on handling CUI [4]. This includes approved CUI categories and descriptions, the basis for 9  safeguarding and dissemination controls, and procedures for the use of CUI.2 The CUI federal 10  regulation [5] provides guidance to federal agencies on the designation, safeguarding, marking, 11  dissemination, decontrolling, and disposition of CUI; establishes self-inspection and oversight 12  requirements; and delineates other facets of the program. 13  The CUI regulation requires federal agencies that use federal information systems3 to process, 14  store, or transmit CUI to comply with NIST standards and guidelines. The responsibility of 15  federal agencies to protect CUI does not change when such information is shared with nonfederal 16  organizations.4 Therefore, a similar level of protection is needed when CUI is processed, stored, 17  or transmitted by nonfederal organizations using nonfederal systems.5 The security requirements 18  for safeguarding CUI in nonfederal systems and organizations are derived from FIPS 199 [6], 19  FIPS 200 [7], and NIST SP 800-53 [8] to maintain a consistent level of protection. 20  Purpose and Applicability 21  The purpose of this publication is to provide federal agencies with recommended security 22  requirements6 for protecting the confidentiality of CUI:7 23  • When the CUI is resident in a nonfederal system and organization 24  • When the nonfederal organization is not collecting or maintaining information on behalf 25  of a federal agency or using or operating a system on behalf of an agency8 26  1 CUI is any information that law, regulation, or governmentwide policy requires to have safeguarding or disseminating controls, excluding  information that is classified under E.O. 13526 [2] or any predecessor or successor order, or the Atomic Energy Act [3] as amended.  2 Procedures for the use of CUI include marking, safeguarding, transporting, disseminating, reusing, and disposing of the information.  3 An information system is a discrete set of information resources organized expressly for the collection, processing, maintenance, use, sharing,  dissemination, or disposition of information. Information systems also include specialized systems, such as industrial/process control systems,  cyber-physical systems, embedded systems, and devices. A federal information system is a system that is used or operated by an executive  agency, by a contractor of an executive agency, or by another organization on behalf of an executive agency. The term system is used in this  publication to represent all types of computing platforms that can process, store, or transmit CUI.  4 A nonfederal organization is any entity that owns, operates, or maintains a nonfederal system.  5 A nonfederal system is any system that does not meet the criteria for a federal information system.  6 The term security requirements refers to the protection needs for a system or organization. Security requirements may be derived from many  sources (e.g., laws, Executive Orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, mission and business needs, or risk assessments).  7 In accordance with E.O. 13526 [2] and 32 CFR 2002 [5], the scope of CUI protection is limited to confidentiality. However, the security  objectives of confidentiality and integrity are closely related since many of the underlying security mechanisms at the system level support both  objectives. Therefore, the security requirements in this publication address the protection of CUI from unauthorized disclosure and modification.  8 Nonfederal organizations that collect or maintain information on behalf of a federal agency or that use or operate a system on behalf of an  agency must comply with the requirements in FISMA [9].  NIST SP 800-171r3 ipd (Initial Public Draft)  Protecting Controlled Unclassified Information  May 2023  2  • Where there are no specific safeguarding requirements for protecting the confidentiality 27  of CUI prescribed by the authorizing law, regulation, or governmentwide policy for the 28  CUI category listed in the CUI registry 29  The security requirements in this publication are only applicable to components of nonfederal 30  systems9 that process, store, or transmit CUI or that provide protection for such components.10 31  The requirements are intended for use by federal agencies in contractual vehicles or other 32  agreements that are established between those agencies and nonfederal organizations. 33  Organization of This Publication 34  The remainder of this special publication is organized as follows: 35  • Section 2 describes the assumptions and methodology used to develop the security 36  requirements for protecting the confidentiality of CUI; the format of the requirements; 37  and the tailoring criteria applied to the NIST standards and guidelines to obtain the 38  requirements. 39  • Section 3 lists the security requirements for protecting the confidentiality of CUI in 40  nonfederal systems and organizations. 41  The following sections provide additional information to support the protection of CUI in 42  nonfederal systems and organizations: 43  • References 44  • Appendix A: Acronyms 45  • Appendix B: Glossary 46  • Appendix C: Tailoring Criteria 47  • Appendix D: Change Log  48  9 Nonfederal systems include information technology (IT) systems, operational technology (OT) systems, and Internet of Things (IoT) devices.  NIST SP 800-82 [10] provides guidance for mitigating risks to OT systems.  10 System components include workstations, servers, notebook computers, smartphones, tablets, input and output devices, network components,  operating systems, virtual machines, database management systems, and applications.  NIST SP 800-171r3 ipd (Initial Public Draft)  Protecting Controlled Unclassified Information  May 2023  3  The Fundamentals 49  This section describes the basic assumptions and methodology used to develop the requirements 50  to protect the confidentiality of CUI in nonfederal systems and organizations. It also includes the 51  tailoring11 criteria applied to the requirements and controls in FIPS 200 [7] and NIST SP 800-53 52  [8].  53  Basic Assumptions 54  The recommended security requirements in this publication are based on the following 55  assumptions: 56  • Federal information designated as CUI has the same value, whether such information 57  resides in a federal or a nonfederal system or organization. 58  • Statutory and regulatory requirements for the protection of CUI are consistent in federal 59  and nonfederal systems and organizations. 60  • Safeguards implemented to protect CUI are consistent in federal and nonfederal systems 61  and organizations. 62  • The confidentiality impact value for CUI is no less than moderate.12 63  Security Requirement Development Methodology 64  Starting with the NIST SP 800-53 security controls in the NIST SP 800-53B [13] moderate 65  control baseline, which satisfy the minimum-security requirements in FIPS 200, the controls are 66  tailored to eliminate selected controls or parts of controls that are: 67  • Primarily the responsibility of the Federal Government 68  • Not directly related to protecting the confidentiality of CUI 69  • Expected to be implemented by nonfederal organizations without specification by the 70  Federal Government 71  The NIST SP 800-171 security requirements represent a subset of the controls that are necessary 72  for a comprehensive information security program. The security requirements are organized into 73  17 families, as illustrated in Table 1. Each family contains the particular requirements related to 74  the general security topic of the family. Certain families from NIST SP 800-53 are not included 75  due to the aforementioned tailoring criteria.13 76  11 The term tailoring is the process by which security and privacy control baselines are modified to achieve certain organizational goals and  objectives [13].  12 In accordance with 32 CFR 2002 [5], CUI is categorized at no less than the moderate confidentiality impact value as defined in FIPS 199 [6].  However, when federal law, regulation, or governmentwide policy establishing the control of CUI specifies controls that differ from those of the  moderate confidentiality baseline, then these will be followed.  13 The PII Processing and Transparency (PT) family is not included because PII is a category of CUI, and therefore, no additional requirements  are specified for confidentiality protection. The Program Management (PM) family is not included because it is not associated with any security  control baseline.

Security requirement families 77  Access Control Maintenance Security Assessment and Monitoring  Awareness and Training Media Protection System and Communications Protection  Audit and Accountability Personnel Security System and Information Integrity  Configuration Management Physical Protection Planning  Identification and Authentication Risk Assessment System and Services Acquisition  Incident Response  Supply Chain Risk Management  78  For some requirements, organization-defined parameters (ODP) are included. These ODPs 79  provide additional flexibility by allowing federal organizations to specify values for the 80  designated parameters, as needed. Flexibility is achieved using assignment and selection 81  operations. The assignment and selection operations provide the capability to customize the 82  requirements based on organizational protection needs. Determination of organization-defined 83  parameter values can be guided and informed by laws, Executive Orders, directives, regulations, 84  policies, standards, guidance, or mission and business needs. Once specified, the values for the 85  organization-defined parameters become part of the requirement. 86  A discussion section is included with each requirement. It is derived from the controls discussion 87  sections in NIST SP 800-53 and provides additional information to facilitate the implementation 88  and assessment of the requirements. The discussion section is informative, not normative. It is 89  not intended to extend the scope of a requirement or to influence the solutions that organizations 90  may use to satisfy a requirement. The use of examples is notional, not exhaustive and not 91  reflective of potential options available to organizations. A references section provides the 92  source controls from NIST SP 800-53 and a list of NIST Special Publications with additional 93  information on the topic described in the security requirement. 94  The structure and content of a typical security requirement is provided in the example below: 95  3.1.8  Unsuccessful Logon Attempts 96  Limit the number of consecutive invalid logon attempts by a user to [Assignment: organization-97  defined number] in [Assignment: organization-defined time period]. 98  DISCUSSION 99  Due to the potential for denial of service, automatic system lockouts are in most cases, temporary and 100  automatically release after a predetermined period established by the organization (i.e., using a delay 101  algorithm). Organizations may employ different delay algorithms for different system components based on 102  the capabilities of the respective components. Responses to unsuccessful system logon attempts may be 103  implemented at the system and application levels. 104  REFERENCES 105  Source Controls: AC-7 106  Supporting Publications: SP 800-63-3 [28], SP 800-124 [29] 107  Appendix C provides a list of the controls from NIST SP 800-53 that support the security 108  requirements and those controls that have been eliminated from the moderate baseline based on 109  the tailoring criteria. 110  https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/cprt/catalog#/cprt/framework/version/SP_800_53_5_1_0/home?element=AC-7  NIST SP 800-171r3 ipd (Initial Public Draft)  Protecting Controlled Unclassified Information  May 2023  5  The Requirements 111  This section describes 17 families of security requirements for protecting the confidentiality of 112  CUI in nonfederal systems and organizations. When used in the context of the requirements in 113  Section 3, the term system means a nonfederal system that processes, stores, or transmits CUI. 114  Access Control 115  3.1.1. Account Management 116  a. Define and document the types of system accounts allowed and prohibited. 117  b. Create, enable, modify, disable, and remove accounts in accordance with [Assignment: 118  organization-defined policy, procedures, prerequisites, and criteria]. 119  c. Specify authorized users of the system, group and role membership, and access 120  authorizations (i.e., privileges). 121  d. Authorize access to the system based on a valid access authorization and intended system 122  usage. 123  e. Monitor the use of accounts. 124  f. Disable accounts of individuals within [Assignment: organization-defined time period] when 125  the accounts:  126  1. Have expired; 127  2. Are no longer associated with a user or individual; 128  3. Are in violation of organizational policy; or 129  4. Have been inactive for [Assignment: organization-defined time period]. 130  g. Disable accounts of individuals within [Assignment: organization-defined time period] of 131  discovery of [Assignment: organization-defined significant risks]. 132  h. Notify [Assignment: organization-defined personnel or roles] within [Assignment: 133  organization-defined time period]: 134  1. When accounts are no longer required; 135  2. When users are terminated or transferred; and 136  3. When system usage or need-to-know changes for an individual. 137  DISCUSSION 138  This requirement focuses on account management for systems and applications. The definition of 139  and enforcement of access authorizations other than those determined by account type (e.g., 140  privileged access, non-privileged access) are addressed in requirement 3.1.2. System account 141  types include individual, shared, group, temporary, system, guest, anonymous, emergency, 142  developer, and service. Users who require administrative privileges on system accounts receive 143  additional scrutiny by organizational personnel responsible for approving such accounts and 144  privileged access. Types of accounts that organizations may prohibit due to increased risk include 145  shared, group, emergency, guest, anonymous, and temporary. 146  Organizations may choose to define access privileges or other attributes by account, by type of 147  account, or a combination of both. Other attributes required for authorizing access include 148  restrictions on time-of-day, day-of-week, and point-of-origin. In defining other account attributes, 149  NIST SP 800-171r3 ipd (Initial Public Draft)  Protecting Controlled Unclassified Information  May 2023  6  organizations consider system-related requirements (e.g., system upgrades, scheduled 150  maintenance) and mission and business requirements (e.g., time zone differences, remote access 151  to support travel requirements). 152  Users who pose a significant security risk include individuals for whom reliable evidence 153  indicates either the intention to use authorized access to the system to cause harm or that 154  adversaries will cause harm through them. Close coordination among human resource managers, 155  system administrators, legal staff, and human resource managers is essential when disabling 156  system accounts for high-risk individuals. Time periods for notification of organizational 157  personnel or roles may vary. 158  REFERENCES 159  Source Controls: AC-2, AC-2(3), AC-2(13) 160  Supporting Publications: SP 800-46 [15], SP 800-57-1 [16], SP 800-57-2 [17], SP 800-57-3 [18], 161  SP 800-77 [19], SP 800-113 [20], SP 800-114 [21], SP 800-121 [22], SP 800-162 [23], SP 800-162  178 [24], SP 800-192 [25], IR 7874 [26], IR 7966 [27] 163  3.1.2.

Types of system access include remote access and access to systems that 170  communicate through external networks, such as the internet. Access enforcement mechanisms 171  can also be employed at the application and service level to provide increased protection for CUI. 172  This recognizes that the system can host many applications and services in support of mission and 173  business functions. 174  REFERENCES 175  Source Controls: AC-3, AC-17 176  Supporting Publications: SP 800-46 [15], SP 800-57-1 [16], SP 800-57-2 [17], SP 800-57-3 [18], 177  SP 800-77 [19], SP 800-113 [20], SP 800-114 [21], SP 800-121 [22], SP 800-162 [23], SP 800-178  178 [24], SP 800-192 [25], IR 7874 [26], IR 7966 [27] 179  3.1.3. Flow Enforcement 180  Enforce approved authorizations for controlling the flow of CUI within the system and between 181  connected systems. 182  DISCUSSION 183  Information flow control regulates where information can transit within a system and between 184  systems (versus who can access the information) and without explicit regard to subsequent 185  accesses to that information. Flow control restrictions include the following: keeping export-186  controlled information from being transmitted in the clear to the internet, blocking outside traffic 187  that claims to be from within the organization, restricting requests to the internet that are not from 188  the internal web proxy server, and limiting information transfers between organizations based on 189  data structures and content. 190  https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/cprt/catalog#/cprt/framework/version/SP_800_53_5_1_0/home?element=AC-2 https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/cprt/catalog#/cprt/framework/version/SP_800_53_5_1_0/home?element=AC-2 https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/cprt/catalog#/cprt/framework/version/SP_800_53_5_1_0/home?element=AC-2 https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/cprt/catalog#/cprt/framework/version/SP_800_53_5_1_0/home?element=AC-3 https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/cprt/catalog#/cprt/framework/version/SP_800_53_5_1_0/home?element=AC-17  NIST SP 800-171r3 ipd (Initial Public Draft)  Protecting Controlled Unclassified Information  May 2023  7  Organizations commonly use information flow control policies and enforcement mechanisms to 191  control the flow of information between designated sources and destinations (e.g., networks, 192  individuals, and devices) within systems and between interconnected systems. Flow control is 193  based on characteristics of the information or the information path. Enforcement occurs in 194  boundary protection devices (e.g., encrypted tunnels, routers, gateways, and firewalls) that 195  employ rule sets or establish configuration settings that restrict system services, provide a packet-196  filtering capability based on header information, or provide a message-filtering capability based 197  on message content (e.g., implementing key word searches or using document characteristics). 198  Organizations also consider the trustworthiness of filtering and inspection mechanisms (i.e., 199  hardware, firmware, and software components) that are critical to information flow enforcement. 200  Transferring information between systems that represent different security domains with different 201  security policies introduces risk that such transfers violate one or more domain security policies. 202  In such situations, information owners or stewards provide guidance at designated policy 203  enforcement points between interconnected systems. Organizations consider mandating specific 204  architectural solutions when required to enforce specific security policies. Enforcement includes 205  prohibiting information transfers between interconnected systems (i.e., allowing information 206  access only), employing hardware mechanisms to enforce one-way information flows, and 207  implementing trustworthy regrading mechanisms to reassign security attributes and security 208  labels. 209  REFERENCES 210  Source Controls: AC-4 211  Supporting Publications: SP 800-160-1 [12], SP 800-162 [23], SP 800-178 [24] 212  3.1.4.

Define system access authorizations to support separation of duties. 215  DISCUSSION 216  Separation of duties addresses the potential for abuse of authorized privileges and helps reduce 217  the risk of malevolent activity without collusion. Separation of duties includes dividing mission 218  functions and support functions among different individuals or roles, conducting system support 219  functions with different individuals or roles (e.g., quality assurance, configuration management, 220  testing, system management, programming, and network security), and ensuring that security 221  personnel who administer access control functions do not also administer audit functions. 222  Because separation of duty violations can span systems and application domains, organizations 223  consider the entirety of their systems and system components when developing policies on 224  separation of duties. 225  REFERENCES 226  Source Controls: AC-5 227  Supporting Publications: SP 800-162 [23], SP 800-178 [24] 228  3.1.5.

Security functions include establishing system accounts, configuring access 239  authorizations (i.e., permissions, privileges), configuring settings for events to be audited, and 240  establishing intrusion detection parameters. Security-relevant information includes filtering rules 241  for routers or firewalls, configuration parameters for security services, cryptographic key 242  management information, and access control lists. Authorized personnel include security 243  administrators, system administrators, system security officers, system programmers, and other 244  privileged users. Organizations consider creating additional processes, roles, and system accounts 245  to achieve least privilege. Least privilege is also applied to the development, implementation, and 246  operation of the system. 247  REFERENCES 248  Source Controls: AC-6, AC-6(1), AC-6(7) 249  Supporting Publications: None 250  3.1.6. Least Privilege – Privileged Accounts  251  a. Restrict privileged accounts on the system to [Assignment: organization-defined personnel or 252  roles]. 253  b. Require that users of system accounts (or roles) with access to [Assignment: organization-254  defined security functions or security-relevant information] use non-privileged accounts or 255  roles when accessing nonsecurity functions. 256  DISCUSSION 257  Privileged accounts, including super user accounts, are typically described as system 258  administrator accounts for various types of commercial off-the-shelf operating systems. 259  Restricting privileged accounts to specific personnel or roles prevents nonprivileged users from 260  accessing privileged information or privileged functions. In restricting privileged accounts, 261  organizations may differentiate between allowed privileges for local accounts and domain 262  accounts provided that they retain the ability to control system configurations for key parameters 263  and as otherwise necessary to sufficiently mitigate risk. 264  Requiring the use of non-privileged accounts when accessing nonsecurity functions limits 265  exposure when operating from within privileged accounts or roles. The inclusion of roles 266  addresses situations in which organizations implement access control policies, such as role-based 267  access control, and where a change of role provides the same degree of assurance in the change of 268  access authorizations for the user and the processes acting on behalf of the user as would be 269  provided by a change between a privileged and non-privileged account. 270  REFERENCES 271  Source Controls: AC-6(2), AC-6(5) 272  Supporting Publications: None 273  https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/cprt/catalog#/cprt/framework/version/SP_800_53_5_1_0/home?element=AC-6 https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/cprt/catalog#/cprt/framework/version/SP_800_53_5_1_0/home?element=AC-6 https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/cprt/catalog#/cprt/framework/version/SP_800_53_5_1_0/home?element=AC-6 https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/cprt/catalog#/cprt/framework/version/SP_800_53_5_1_0/home?element=AC-6 https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/cprt/catalog#/cprt/framework/version/SP_800_53_5_1_0/home?element=AC-6  NIST SP 800-171r3 ipd (Initial Public Draft)  Protecting Controlled Unclassified Information  May 2023  9  3.1.7. Least Privilege – Privileged Functions 274  a. Prevent non-privileged users from executing privileged functions. 275  b. Log the execution of privileged functions. 276  DISCUSSION 277  Privileged functions include establishing system accounts, performing system integrity checks, 278  conducting patching operations, or administering cryptographic key management activities. Non-279  privileged users do not possess appropriate authorizations. Circumventing intrusion detection and 280  prevention mechanisms or malicious code protection mechanisms are examples of privileged 281  functions that require protection from non-privileged users. Note that this requirement represents 282  a condition to be achieved by the definition of authorized privileges in 3.1.2. 283  The misuse of privileged functions – whether intentionally or unintentionally by authorized users 284  or by unauthorized external entities that have compromised system accounts – is a serious and 285  ongoing concern that can have significant adverse impacts on organizations. Logging the use of 286  privileged functions is one way to detect such misuse and mitigate the risk from insider threats 287  and advanced persistent threats. 288  REFERENCES 289  Source Controls: AC-6(9), AC-6(10) 290  Supporting Publications: None 291  3.1.8.

Conceal, via the device lock, information previously visible on the display with a publicly 325  viewable image. 326  DISCUSSION 327  Device locks are temporary actions taken to prevent access to the system when users depart 328  from the immediate vicinity of the system but do not want to log out because of the temporary 329  nature of their absences. Device locks can be implemented at the operating system or 330  application level.

Session Termination 340  Terminate a user session automatically after [Assignment: organization-defined conditions or 341  trigger events]. 342  DISCUSSION 343  This requirement addresses the termination of user-initiated logical sessions in contrast to the 344  termination of network connections that are associated with communications sessions (i.e., 345  disconnecting from the network) in 3.13.9. A logical session is initiated whenever a user (or 346  process acting on behalf of a user) accesses a system. Such sessions can be terminated (and 347  terminate user access) without terminating network sessions.

Authorize remote execution of privileged commands and remote access to security-relevant 362  information. 363  e. Implement cryptographic mechanisms to protect the confidentiality of remote access 364  sessions. 365  DISCUSSION 366  Remote access to the system represents a significant potential vulnerability that can be exploited 367  by adversaries. Monitoring and controlling remote access methods allows organizations to 368  detect attacks and help ensure compliance with remote access policies. This occurs by auditing 369  the connection activities of remote users on a variety of systems, including servers, notebook 370  computers, workstations, smart phones, and tablets. Routing remote access through managed 371  access control points enhances explicit control over such connections. It also reduces the 372  susceptibility to unauthorized access to the system which could result in the unauthorized 373  disclosure of CUI. 374  Restricting the execution of privileged commands and access to security-relevant information 375  via remote access reduces the exposure of the organization and its susceptibility to threats by 376  adversaries. A privileged command is a human-initiated command executed on a system that 377  involves the control, monitoring, or administration of the system, including security functions 378  and security-relevant information. Security-relevant information is information that can 379  potentially impact the operation of security functions or the provision of security services in a 380  manner that could result in failure to enforce the system security policy or maintain isolation of 381  code and data. Privileged commands give individuals the ability to execute sensitive, security-382  critical, or security-relevant system functions. Controlling access from remote locations helps to 383  ensure that unauthorized individuals are not able to execute such commands with the potential 384  to do serious or catastrophic damage to the system. 385  REFERENCES 386  Source Controls: AC-17, AC-17(1), AC-17(3), AC-17(4) 387  Supporting Publications: SP 800-46 [15], SP 800-77 [19], SP 800-113 [20], SP 800-114 [21], 388  SP 800-121 [22], IR 7966 [27] 389  3.1.13.

Implemented controls on the external system as specified in the organization’s security 481  policies and security plans are verified; or 482  2. Approved system connection or processing agreements with the organizational entity 483  hosting the external system are retained. 484  b. Restrict the use of organization-controlled portable storage devices by authorized 485  individuals on external systems as follows: [Assignment: organization-defined usage 486  restrictions]. 487  DISCUSSION 488  Limiting authorized use recognizes circumstances in which individuals who use external 489  systems may need to access the organizational system. Organizations need assurance that the 490  external systems contain the necessary controls so as not to compromise, damage, or otherwise 491  harm the system. Verification that the required controls have been implemented can be achieved 492  through independent assessments, attestations, or other means, depending on the confidence 493  level required by the organization. Limits on the use of organization-controlled portable storage 494  devices in external systems include restrictions on how the devices may be used and under what 495  conditions. 496  REFERENCES 497  Source Controls: AC-20(1), AC-20(2) 498  Supporting Publications: None 499  3.1.22.

Organizations determine the content of literacy training and awareness 535  based on specific organizational requirements, the systems to which personnel have authorized 536  access, and work environments (e.g., telework). The content includes an understanding of the 537  need for security and the actions required of users to maintain security and to respond to 538  suspected incidents. The content also addresses the need for operations security and the handling 539  of CUI. 540  Awareness techniques include displaying posters, offering supplies inscribed with security 541  reminders, displaying logon screen messages, generating email advisories or notices from 542  organizational officials, and conducting awareness events. Literacy training is conducted at a 543  frequency consistent with applicable laws, directives, regulations, and policies.

In addition, organizations provide 562  system developers, enterprise architects, security architects, acquisition/procurement officials, 563  software developers, system developers, systems integrators, system and network administrators, 564  personnel conducting configuration management and auditing activities, personnel performing 565  independent verification and validation, security assessors, and personnel with access to system-566  level software with security-related technical training specifically tailored for their assigned 567  duties. 568  Comprehensive role-based training addresses management, operational, and technical roles and 569  responsibilities that cover physical, personnel, and technical controls. Such training can include 570  policies, procedures, tools, and artifacts for the security roles defined.

Advanced Literacy Training 577  Provide literacy training on recognizing and reporting potential and actual indicators of insider 578  threat, social engineering, and social mining. 579  DISCUSSION 580  Potential indicators and possible precursors of insider threat include behaviors such as inordinate, 581  long-term job dissatisfaction; attempts to gain access to information that is not required for job 582  performance; unexplained access to financial resources; bullying or sexual harassment of fellow 583  employees; workplace violence; and other serious violations of the policies, procedures, 584  directives, rules, or practices of organizations. Security awareness training includes how to 585  communicate employee and management concerns regarding potential indicators of insider threat 586  through appropriate organizational channels in accordance with established organizational 587  policies and procedures. Organizations may consider tailoring insider threat awareness topics to 588  the role (e.g., training for managers may be focused on specific changes in the behavior of team 589  members, while training for employees may be focused on more general observations). 590  Social engineering is an attempt to deceive an individual into revealing information or taking an 591  action that can be used to breach, compromise, or otherwise adversely impact a system. Social 592  engineering includes phishing, pretexting, impersonation, baiting, quid pro quo, thread-jacking, 593  https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/cprt/catalog#/cprt/framework/version/SP_800_53_5_1_0/home?element=AT-3  NIST SP 800-171r3 ipd (Initial Public Draft)  Protecting Controlled Unclassified Information  May 2023  17  social media exploitation, and tailgating. Social mining is an attempt to gather information about 594  the organization that may be used to support future attacks.

Event Logging 603  a. Specify the following event types for logging within the system: [Assignment: organization-604  defined event types]. 605  b. Review and update the event types selected for logging [Assignment: organization-defined 606  frequency]. 607  DISCUSSION 608  An event is any observable occurrence in a system, which includes unlawful or unauthorized 609  system activity. Organizations identify event types for which a logging functionality is needed as 610  those events that are significant and relevant to the security of systems and the environments in 611  which those systems operate to meet specific and ongoing auditing needs. Event types can 612  include password changes, failed logons or failed accesses related to systems, administrative 613  privilege usage, or third-party credential usage. In determining event types that require logging, 614  organizations consider the system monitoring and auditing that are appropriate for each of the 615  CUI security requirements. When defining event types, organizations consider the logging 616  necessary to cover related events, such as the steps in distributed, transaction-based processes 617  (e.g., processes that are distributed across multiple organizations) and actions that occur in 618  service-oriented or cloud-based architectures. Monitoring and auditing requirements can be 619  balanced with other system needs. For example, organizations may determine that systems must 620  have the capability to log every file access, both successful and unsuccessful, but not activate that 621  capability except for specific circumstances due to the potential burden on system performance. 622  The event types that are logged by organizations may change over time. Periodically reviewing 623  and updating the set of logged event types is necessary to ensure that the current set remains 624  necessary and sufficient.  625  REFERENCES 626  Source Controls: AU-2 627  Supporting Publications: SP 800-92 [39] 628  3.3.2.

Retain audit records for [Assignment: organization-defined time period consistent with 647  records retention policy, applicable contract requirement, law, or regulation]. 648  DISCUSSION 649  Audit records can be generated at various levels of abstraction, including at the packet level as 650  information traverses the network. Selecting the appropriate level of abstraction is a critical 651  aspect of an audit logging capability and can facilitate the identification of root causes to 652  problems. The ability to add information generated in audit records is dependent on system 653  functionality to configure the audit record content. Organizations may consider additional 654  information in audit records including access control or flow control rules invoked and individual 655  identities of group account users. Organizations may also consider limiting additional audit 656  record information to only information that is explicitly needed for audit requirements. 657  REFERENCES 658  Source Controls: AU-11, AU-12 659  Supporting Publications: SP 800-92 [39] 660  3.3.4.

Findings can be reported to organizational entities that 692  include the incident response team, help desk, and security or privacy offices. If organizations are 693  prohibited from reviewing and analyzing audit records or unable to conduct such activities, the 694  review or analysis may be carried out by other organizations granted such authority. The scope, 695  frequency, and/or depth of the audit record review, analysis, and reporting may be adjusted to 696  meet organizational needs based on new information received.

Time is commonly expressed in 730  Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) – a modern continuation of Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) – 731  or local time with an offset from UTC. The granularity of time measurements refers to the degree 732  of synchronization between system clocks and reference clocks (e.g., clocks synchronizing within 733  hundreds of milliseconds or tens of milliseconds). Organizations may define different time 734  granularities for different system components. Time service can be critical to other security 735  capabilities, such as access control, and identification and authentication, depending on the nature 736  of the mechanisms used to support those capabilities. 737  REFERENCES 738  Source Controls: AU-8, SC-45, SC-45(1) 739  Supporting Publications: None 740  3.3.8.

Review the system [Assignment: organization-defined frequency] to identify and 871  disable/remove functions, ports, protocols, software, and/or services identified in 3.4.6b. 872  DISCUSSION 873  Systems can provide a variety of functions and services. Some functions and services that are 874  routinely provided by default may not be necessary to support essential organizational missions, 875  functions, or operations. It may be convenient to provide multiple services from single system 876  components. However, doing so increases risk over limiting the services provided by any one 877  component. Where feasible, organizations limit functionality to a single function per component. 878  Organizations review the functions and services provided by systems or system components to 879  determine which functions and services are candidates for elimination. Organizations disable 880  unused or unnecessary physical and logical ports and protocols to prevent the unauthorized 881  connection of devices, the transfer of information, and tunneling. Organizations can utilize 882  network scanning tools, intrusion detection and prevention systems, and end-point protections 883  (e.g., firewalls and host-based intrusion detection systems) to identify and prevent the use of 884  prohibited functions, ports, protocols, and services. 885  Restricting the use of nonessential software (programs) includes restricting the roles allowed to 886  approve program execution, prohibiting auto-execute, and restricting the number of program 887  instances executed at the same time. Bluetooth, File Transfer Protocol (FTP), and peer-to-peer 888  networking are examples of protocols that organizations consider eliminating, restricting, or 889  disabling. 890  REFERENCES 891  Source Controls: CM-7, CM-7(1), CM-7(2) 892  Supporting Publications: SP 800-160-1 [12], SP 800-167 [50] 893  3.4.7.

Multi-factor authentication 1031  solutions that feature physical authenticators include hardware authenticators that provide time-1032  based or challenge-response outputs and smart cards. In addition to authenticating users at the 1033  system level, organizations may also employ authentication mechanisms at the application level 1034  to provide increased information security. 1035  REFERENCES 1036  Source Controls: IA-2(1), IA-2(2) 1037  Supporting Publications: SP 800-63-3 [28] 1038  3.5.4.

Select a new password immediately upon account recovery. 1079  g. Allow the use of a temporary password for system logons with an immediate change to a 1080  permanent password. 1081  DISCUSSION 1082  Password-based authentication applies to passwords used in single-factor or multi-factor 1083  authentication. Long passwords or passphrases are preferable over shorter passwords. Enforced 1084  composition rules provide marginal security benefits while decreasing usability. However, 1085  organizations may choose to establish certain rules for password generation (e.g., minimum 1086  character length) under certain circumstances and can enforce this requirement. For example, 1087  account recovery can occur when a password is forgotten. Cryptographically protected passwords 1088  include salted one-way cryptographic hashes of passwords. The list of commonly used, 1089  compromised, or expected passwords includes passwords obtained from previous breach 1090  corpuses, dictionary words, and repetitive or sequential characters. The list includes context-1091  specific words, such as the name of the service, username, and derivatives thereof. Changing 1092  temporary passwords to permanent passwords immediately after system logon ensures that the 1093  necessary strength of the authentication mechanism is implemented at the earliest opportunity and 1094  reduces the susceptibility to authenticator compromises. 1095  REFERENCES 1096  Source Controls: IA-5(1) 1097  Supporting Publications: SP 800-63-3 [28] 1098  3.5.8.

Authentication Feedback 1102  Obscure feedback of authentication information. 1103  DISCUSSION 1104  The feedback from systems does not provide information that would allow unauthorized 1105  individuals to compromise authentication mechanisms. For example, for desktop or notebook 1106  computers with relatively large monitors, the threat may be significant (often referred to as 1107  shoulder surfing). For mobile devices with small displays, this threat may be less significant and 1108  is balanced against the increased likelihood of input errors due to small keyboards. Therefore, 1109  the means for obscuring the authenticator feedback is selected accordingly. Obscuring 1110  authenticator feedback includes displaying asterisks when users type passwords into input 1111  devices or displaying feedback for a limited time before fully obscuring it. 1112  REFERENCES 1113  Source Controls: IA-6 1114  Supporting Publications: None 1115  3.5.12.

The initial authenticator content is the actual content of the 1130  authenticator (e.g., the initial password). In contrast, requirements for authenticator content 1131  contain specific characteristics. Authenticator management is supported by organization-defined 1132  settings and restrictions for various authenticator characteristics (e.g., password complexity and 1133  composition rules, validation time window for time synchronous one-time tokens, and the 1134  number of allowed rejections during the verification stage of biometric authentication). 1135  The requirement to protect individual authenticators may be implemented by 3.15.3 for 1136  authenticators in the possession of individuals and by 3.1.1, 3.1.2, 3.1.5, and 3.13.8 for 1137  authenticators stored in organizational systems. This includes passwords stored in hashed or 1138  encrypted formats or files that contain encrypted or hashed passwords accessible with 1139  administrator privileges. Actions can be taken to safeguard authenticators, including 1140  maintaining possession of authenticators, not sharing authenticators with others, and 1141  immediately reporting lost, stolen, or compromised authenticators.

Review and update incident response training content [Assignment: organization-defined 1209  frequency] and following [Assignment: organization-defined events]. 1210  DISCUSSION 1211  Incident response training is associated with the assigned roles and responsibilities of 1212  organizational personnel to ensure that the appropriate content and level of detail are included in 1213  such training. For example, users may only need to know who to call or how to recognize an 1214  incident; system administrators may require additional training on how to handle incidents; and 1215  incident responders may receive specific training on forensics, data collection techniques, 1216  reporting, system recovery, and system restoration. Incident response training includes user 1217  training in identifying and reporting suspicious activities from external and internal sources. 1218  Incident response training for users may be provided as part of 3.2.2. Events that may precipitate 1219  an update to incident response training content include incident response plan testing, response to 1220  an actual incident, audit or assessment findings, or changes in applicable laws, Executive Orders, 1221  policies, directives, regulations, standards, and guidelines. 1222  https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/cprt/catalog#/cprt/framework/version/SP_800_53_5_1_0/home?element=IR-5 https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/cprt/catalog#/cprt/framework/version/SP_800_53_5_1_0/home?element=IR-6 https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/cprt/catalog#/cprt/framework/version/SP_800_53_5_1_0/home?element=IR-7 https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/cprt/catalog#/cprt/framework/version/SP_800_53_5_1_0/home?element=IR-3  NIST SP 800-171r3 ipd (Initial Public Draft)  Protecting Controlled Unclassified Information  May 2023  33  REFERENCES 1223  Source Controls: IR-2 1224  Supporting Publications: SP 800-86 [40], SP 800-137 [53] 1225  Maintenance 1226  3.7.1.

Approve, control, and monitor the use of system maintenance tools. 1231  b. Inspect maintenance tools and media containing diagnostic and test programs for malicious 1232  code before the media and tools are used in the system. 1233  c. Prevent the removal of maintenance equipment containing CUI by: 1234  1. Verifying that there is no CUI on the equipment; 1235  2. Sanitizing or destroying the equipment; or 1236  3. Obtaining an exemption from [Assignment: organization-defined officials] explicitly 1237  authorizing removal of the equipment from the facility. 1238  DISCUSSION 1239  Approving, controlling, monitoring, and reviewing maintenance tools address security-related 1240  issues associated with the tools that are used for diagnostic and repair actions on the system. 1241  Maintenance tools can include hardware and software diagnostic and test equipment as well as 1242  packet sniffers. The tools may be pre-installed, brought in with maintenance personnel on media, 1243  cloud-based, or downloaded from a website. Diagnostic and test programs are potential vehicles 1244  for transporting malicious code into the system, either intentionally or unintentionally. Examples 1245  of media inspection include checking the cryptographic hash or digital signatures of diagnostic 1246  and test programs and/or media. If, upon inspection of media that contain maintenance diagnostic 1247  and test programs, organizations determine that the media contain malicious code, the incident is 1248  handled consistent with incident handling policies and procedures. A periodic review of system 1249  maintenance tools can result in the withdrawal of approval for outdated, unsupported, irrelevant, 1250  or no-longer-used tools. The hardware and software components that support maintenance and 1251  are considered a part of the system (including software implementing utilities such as “ping,” 1252  “ls,” “ipconfig,” or hardware and software that implement the monitoring port of an Ethernet 1253  switch) are not addressed by maintenance tools. 1254  REFERENCES 1255  Source Controls: MA-3, MA-3(1), MA-3(2), MA-3(3) 1256  Supporting Publications: SP 800-88 [54] 1257  https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/cprt/catalog#/cprt/framework/version/SP_800_53_5_1_0/home?element=IR-2 https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/cprt/catalog#/cprt/framework/version/SP_800_53_5_1_0/home?element=MA-3 https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/cprt/catalog#/cprt/framework/version/SP_800_53_5_1_0/home?element=MA-3 https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/cprt/catalog#/cprt/framework/version/SP_800_53_5_1_0/home?element=MA-3 https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/cprt/catalog#/cprt/framework/version/SP_800_53_5_1_0/home?element=MA-3  NIST SP 800-171r3 ipd (Initial Public Draft)  Protecting Controlled Unclassified Information  May 2023  34  3.7.5.

Designate organizational personnel with required access authorizations and technical 1277  competence to supervise the maintenance activities of personnel who do not possess the 1278  required access authorizations. 1279  DISCUSSION 1280  Maintenance personnel refers to individuals who perform hardware or software maintenance on 1281  the system, while 3.10.1 addresses physical access for individuals whose maintenance duties 1282  place them within the physical protection perimeter of the system. Technical competence of 1283  supervising individuals relates to the maintenance performed on the system, while having 1284  required access authorizations refers to maintenance on and near the system. Individuals not 1285  previously identified as authorized maintenance personnel (e.g., manufacturers, consultants, 1286  systems integrators, and vendors) may require privileged access to the system, such as when they 1287  are required to conduct maintenance with little or no notice. Organizations may choose to issue 1288  temporary credentials to these individuals based on their risk assessments.

Media Sanitization 1319  Sanitize system media containing CUI prior to maintenance, disposal, release out of 1320  organizational control, or release for reuse. 1321  DISCUSSION 1322  Media sanitization applies to all digital and non-digital system media subject to disposal or reuse, 1323  whether or not the media is considered removable. Examples include digital media in scanners, 1324  copiers, printers, notebook computers, workstations, mobile devices, network components, and 1325  non-digital media. The sanitization process removes CUI from system media such that the 1326  information cannot be retrieved or reconstructed. Sanitization techniques (e.g., clearing, purging, 1327  cryptographically erasing, and destroying) prevent the disclosure of information to unauthorized 1328  individuals when such media is reused or released for disposal. Organizations determine the 1329  appropriate sanitization methods with the recognition that destruction is sometimes necessary 1330  https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/cprt/catalog#/cprt/framework/version/SP_800_53_5_1_0/home?element=MP-4 https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/cprt/catalog#/cprt/framework/version/SP_800_53_5_1_0/home?element=MP-2  NIST SP 800-171r3 ipd (Initial Public Draft)  Protecting Controlled Unclassified Information  May 2023  36  when other methods cannot be applied to media that require sanitization.

Implement cryptographic mechanisms to prevent the unauthorized disclosure of CUI stored 1354  on digital media during transport. 1355  DISCUSSION 1356  System media includes digital and non-digital media. Digital media includes flash drives, 1357  diskettes, magnetic tapes, external or removable solid state or magnetic drives, compact discs, 1358  and digital versatile discs. Non-digital media includes microfilm and paper. Controlled areas are 1359  spaces for which organizations provide physical or procedural controls to meet the requirements 1360  established for protecting information and systems. Controls to protect media during transport 1361  include cryptography and locked containers. Cryptographic mechanisms can provide 1362  confidentiality protections, depending on the mechanisms implemented. Activities associated 1363  with media transport include releasing media for transport, ensuring that media enters the 1364  appropriate transport processes, and the actual transport. Authorized transport and courier 1365  personnel may include individuals external to the organization. Maintaining accountability of 1366  system media during transport includes restricting transport activities to authorized personnel and 1367  tracking or obtaining records of transport activities as the media moves through the transportation 1368  system to prevent and detect loss, destruction, or tampering. 1369  https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/cprt/catalog#/cprt/framework/version/SP_800_53_5_1_0/home?element=MP-6 https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/cprt/catalog#/cprt/framework/version/SP_800_53_5_1_0/home?element=MP-3  NIST SP 800-171r3 ipd (Initial Public Draft)  Protecting Controlled Unclassified Information  May 2023  37  REFERENCES 1370  Source Controls: MP-5, SC-28, SC-28(1) 1371  Supporting Publications: SP 800-111 [55] 1372  3.8.6.

Prohibit the use of portable storage devices when such devices have no identifiable owner. 1377  DISCUSSION 1378  In contrast to requirement 3.8.1, which restricts user access to media, this requirement restricts 1379  the use of certain types of media on systems, such as restricting or prohibiting the use of flash 1380  drives or external hard drives. Organizations can employ technical and nontechnical controls 1381  (e.g., policies, procedures, and rules of behavior) to control the use of system media. For 1382  example, organizations may control the use of portable storage devices by using physical cages 1383  on workstations to prohibit access to external ports or disabling or removing the ability to insert, 1384  read, or write to devices. 1385  Organizations may limit the use of portable storage devices to only approved devices, including 1386  devices provided by the organization, devices provided by other approved organizations, and 1387  devices that are not personally owned. Finally, organizations may control the use of portable 1388  storage devices based on the type of device – prohibiting the use of writeable, portable devices –  1389  and implement this restriction by disabling or removing the capability to write to such devices. 1390  Requiring identifiable owners (e.g., individuals, organizations, or projects) for portable storage 1391  devices reduces the risk of using such technologies by allowing organizations to assign 1392  responsibility and accountability for addressing known vulnerabilities in the devices (e.g., 1393  insertion of malicious code). 1394  REFERENCES 1395  Source Controls: MP-7 1396  Supporting Publications: SP 800-111 [55] 1397  3.8.8.

Access Control for Transmission and Output Devices 1555  a. Control physical access to system distribution and transmission lines within organizational 1556  facilities. 1557  b. Control physical access to output from [Assignment: organization-defined output devices] to 1558  prevent unauthorized individuals from obtaining the output. 1559  DISCUSSION 1560  Safeguarding measures applied to system distribution and transmission lines prevent accidental 1561  damage, disruption, and physical tampering. Such controls may also be necessary to prevent 1562  eavesdropping or the modification of unencrypted transmissions. Security controls used to 1563  control physical access to system distribution and transmission lines include disconnected or 1564  locked spare jacks, locked wiring closets, protection of cabling by conduit or cable trays, and 1565  wiretapping sensors. Controlling physical access to output devices includes placing output 1566  devices in locked rooms or other secured areas with keypad or card reader access controls and 1567  allowing access to authorized individuals only, placing output devices in locations that can be 1568  monitored by personnel, installing monitor or screen filters, and using headphones.

Risk Assessment 1576  a. Assess the risk (including supply chain risk) of unauthorized disclosure resulting from the 1577  processing, storage, or transmission of CUI.  1578  b. Update risk assessments (including supply chain risk) [Assignment: organization-defined 1579  frequency]. 1580  DISCUSSION 1581  Clearly defined system boundaries are a prerequisite for effective risk assessments. Risk 1582  assessments consider threats, vulnerabilities, likelihood, and impact to organizational operations 1583  and assets based on the operation and use of the system. Risk assessments also consider risk 1584  from external parties (e.g., service providers, contractors operating systems on behalf of the 1585  organization, individuals accessing systems, outsourcing entities). Risk assessments, either 1586  formal or informal, can be conducted at the organization level, the mission or business process 1587  level, or the system level and at any phase in the system development life cycle. 1588  Risk assessments include supply chain-related risks associated with suppliers or contractors and 1589  the system, system component, or system service that they provide. Supply chain events that 1590  affect risk include disruption, the use of defective components, the insertion of counterfeits, 1591  theft, malicious development practices, improper delivery practices, and the insertion of 1592  malicious code. These events can have a significant impact on the system and its information 1593  and, therefore, can also adversely impact organizations. The supply chain events may be 1594  unintentional or malicious and can occur at any point in the system life cycle. 1595  https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/cprt/catalog#/cprt/framework/version/SP_800_53_5_1_0/home?element=PE-4 https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/cprt/catalog#/cprt/framework/version/SP_800_53_5_1_0/home?element=PE-5  NIST SP 800-171r3 ipd (Initial Public Draft)  Protecting Controlled Unclassified Information  May 2023  43  REFERENCES 1596  Source Controls: RA-3, RA-3(1), SR-6 1597  Supporting Publications: SP 800-30 [59], SP 800-161 [37] 1598  3.11.2. Vulnerability Monitoring and Scanning 1599  a. Monitor and scan for vulnerabilities in the system [Assignment: organization-defined 1600  frequency] and when new vulnerabilities affecting the system are identified. 1601  b. Remediate vulnerabilities [Assignment: organization-defined response times] in accordance 1602  with an organizational assessment of risk. 1603  c. Update vulnerabilities to be scanned [Assignment: organization-defined frequency]. 1604  d. Implement privileged access authorization to the system for vulnerability scanning activities. 1605  DISCUSSION 1606  Organizations determine the required vulnerability scanning for system components (including 1607  hardware, software, firmware, and applications) and ensure that potential sources of 1608  vulnerabilities (e.g., networked printers, scanners, and copiers) are not overlooked. The 1609  vulnerabilities to be scanned are readily updated as new vulnerabilities are discovered and 1610  announced and new scanning methods are developed. This process ensures that potential 1611  vulnerabilities in the system are identified and addressed as quickly as possible.  1612  Vulnerability analyses for custom software may require additional approaches, such as static 1613  analysis, dynamic analysis, binary analysis, or a hybrid of the three approaches. Organizations 1614  can employ these analysis approaches in source code reviews and in a variety of tools (e.g., 1615  static analysis tools, web-based application scanners, binary analyzers). Vulnerability scanning 1616  includes scanning for patch levels; scanning for functions, ports, protocols, and services that 1617  should not be accessible to users or devices; and scanning for improperly configured or 1618  incorrectly operating information flow control mechanisms. 1619  To facilitate interoperability, organizations consider using products that are Security Content 1620  Automated Protocol (SCAP)-validated, as well as scanning tools that express vulnerabilities in 1621  the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) naming convention and that employ the 1622  Open Vulnerability Assessment Language (OVAL) to determine the presence of system 1623  vulnerabilities. Sources for vulnerability information include the Common Weakness 1624  Enumeration (CWE) listing and the National Vulnerability Database (NVD). 1625  Security assessments, such as red team exercises, provide additional sources of potential 1626  vulnerabilities for which to scan. Organizations also consider using scanning tools that express 1627  vulnerability impact by the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS). In certain 1628  situations, the nature of the vulnerability scanning may be more intrusive, or the system 1629  component that is the subject of the scanning may contain highly sensitive information. 1630  Privileged access authorization to selected system components facilitates thorough vulnerability 1631  scanning and protects the sensitive nature of such scanning. 1632  REFERENCES 1633  Source Controls: RA-5, RA-5(2), RA-5(5) 1634  Supporting Publications: SP 800-40 [60], SP 800-53A [61], SP 800-70 [48], SP 800-115 [62], 1635  SP 800-126 [49] 1636  3.11.3.

Risk Response  1638  Respond to findings from security assessments, monitoring, and audits. 1639  DISCUSSION 1640  Organizations have many options for responding to risk, including mitigating risk by 1641  implementing new controls or strengthening existing controls, accepting risk with appropriate 1642  justification or rationale, sharing or transferring risk, or avoiding risk. The organizational risk 1643  management strategy and risk tolerance influence risk response decisions and actions. This 1644  requirement addresses the need to determine an appropriate response to risk before generating a 1645  plan of action and milestones entry. For example, the response may be to accept risk or reject 1646  risk, or it may be possible to mitigate the risk immediately so that a plan of action and 1647  milestones entry is not needed. However, if the risk response is to mitigate the risk, and the 1648  mitigation cannot be completed immediately, a plan of action and milestones entry is generated.  1649  REFERENCES 1650  Source Controls: RA-7 1651  Supporting Publications: SP 800-30 [59], SP 800-37 [63], SP 800-39 [64], SP 800-160-1 [12] 1652  Security Assessment and Monitoring 1653  3.12.1. Control Assessments 1654  Assess the controls in the system and its environment of operation [Assignment: organization-1655  defined frequency] to determine the extent to which the controls are implemented correctly, 1656  operating as intended, and producing the desired outcome with respect to meeting specified 1657  security requirements. 1658  DISCUSSION 1659  Organizations assess security controls in the system and the environment in which that system 1660  operates as part of the system development life cycle. Security controls are the safeguards that 1661  organizations implement to satisfy security requirements. By assessing implemented security 1662  controls, organizations determine whether the necessary safeguards are in place and operating 1663  as intended. Security control assessments identify weaknesses and deficiencies early in the 1664  system life cycle, provide essential information needed to make risk-based decisions, and ensure 1665  compliance to vulnerability mitigation procedures. Assessments are conducted on the 1666  implemented controls as documented in system security plans. 1667  Security assessment reports document assessment results in sufficient detail as deemed 1668  necessary by organizations to determine the accuracy and completeness of the reports and 1669  whether the security controls are implemented correctly, operating as intended, and producing 1670  the desired outcome with respect to meeting security requirements. Security assessment results 1671  are provided to the individuals or roles appropriate for the types of assessments being 1672  conducted. 1673  Organizations ensure that assessment results are current, relevant to the determination of control 1674  effectiveness, and obtained with the appropriate level of assessor independence. Organizations 1675  can choose to use other types of assessment activities, such as vulnerability scanning and 1676  system monitoring, to maintain the security posture of the system during the system life cycle. 1677  https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/cprt/catalog#/cprt/framework/version/SP_800_53_5_1_0/home?element=RA-7  NIST SP 800-171r3 ipd (Initial Public Draft)  Protecting Controlled Unclassified Information  May 2023  45  REFERENCES 1678  Source Controls: CA-2 1679  Supporting Publications: SP 800-53 [8], SP 800-53A [61], SP 800-37 [63], SP 800-115 [62] 1680  3.12.2. Plan of Action and Milestones 1681  a. Develop a plan of action and milestones for the system: 1682  1. To document the planned remediation actions to correct weaknesses or deficiencies 1683  noted during control assessments; and 1684  2.

Organizations use POAMs to describe how unimplemented security requirements 1691  and security controls will be met and how planned mitigations will be implemented. 1692  Organizations can document system security plans and POAMs as separate or combined 1693  documents and in any chosen format. Federal agencies may consider system security plans and 1694  POAMs as inputs to risk-based decisions on whether to process, store, or transmit CUI on a 1695  system hosted by a nonfederal organization. 1696  REFERENCES 1697  Source Controls: CA-5 1698  Supporting Publications: SP 800-37 [63] 1699  3.12.3. Continuous Monitoring 1700  Develop and implement a system-level continuous monitoring strategy that includes ongoing 1701  monitoring and assessment of control effectiveness. 1702  DISCUSSION 1703  Continuous monitoring at the system level facilitates ongoing awareness of the system security 1704  posture to support organizational risk management decisions. The terms continuous and 1705  ongoing imply that organizations assess and monitor their controls and risks at a frequency 1706  sufficient to support risk-based decisions. Different types of controls may require different 1707  monitoring frequencies. When monitoring the effectiveness of multiple controls that have been 1708  grouped into capabilities, a root cause analysis may be needed to determine the specific control 1709  that has failed. 1710  REFERENCES 1711  Source Controls: CA-7 1712  Supporting Publications: SP 800-37 [63], SP 800-39 [64], SP 800-53A [61], SP 800-115 [62], 1713  SP 800-137 [53] 1714  3.12.4.

Independent Assessment 1716  Use independent assessors or assessment teams to assess controls. 1717  DISCUSSION 1718  Independent assessors or assessment teams are individuals or groups who conduct impartial 1719  security assessments of the system. Impartiality means that assessors are free from perceived or 1720  actual conflicts of interest regarding the development, operation, sustainment, or management 1721  of the system under assessment or the determination of control effectiveness. To achieve 1722  impartiality, assessors do not create a mutual or conflicting interest with the organizations 1723  where the assessments are being conducted, assess their own work, act as management or 1724  employees of the organizations they are serving, or place themselves in positions of advocacy 1725  for the organizations that acquire their services. 1726  REFERENCES 1727  Source Controls: CA-2(1) 1728  Supporting Publications: SP 800-37 [63], SP 800-53A [61], SP 800-115 [62], SP 800-137 [53] 1729  3.12.6.

Intra-system connections include 1758  connections with mobile devices, notebook and desktop computers, tablets, printers, copiers, 1759  facsimile machines, scanners, sensors, and servers. Instead of authorizing each internal system 1760  connection, organizations can authorize internal connections for a class of system components 1761  with common characteristics and/or configurations, including printers, scanners, and copiers 1762  with a specified processing, transmission, and storage capability or smart phones and tablets 1763  with a specific baseline configuration. 1764  REFERENCES 1765  Source Controls: CA-9 1766  Supporting Publications: SP 800-124 [29] 1767  System and Communications Protection 1768  3.13.1.

Subnetworks that are either physically or logically separated from internal 1780  networks are referred to as demilitarized zones or DMZs. Restricting or prohibiting interfaces 1781  within organizational systems includes restricting external web traffic to designated web servers 1782  within managed interfaces, prohibiting external traffic that appears to be spoofing internal 1783  addresses, and prohibiting internal traffic that appears to be spoofing external addresses. 1784  Boundary protection may be implemented as a common control for all or part of an 1785  organizational network such that the boundary to be protected is greater than a system-specific 1786  boundary (i.e., an authorization boundary). 1787  Organizations consider the shared nature of commercial telecommunications services in the 1788  implementation of security requirements associated with the use of such services. Commercial 1789  telecommunications services are commonly based on network components and consolidated 1790  management systems shared by all attached commercial customers and may also include third 1791  party-provided access lines and other service elements.

The 1803  separation of user functionality from system management functionality is physical or logical. 1804  Organizations can implement the separation of system management functionality from user 1805  functionality by using different computers, different central processing units, different instances 1806  of operating systems, different network addresses, virtualization techniques, or combinations of 1807  these or other methods, as appropriate. This type of separation includes web administrative 1808  interfaces that use separate authentication methods for users of any other system resources.

Information in Shared System Resources 1815  Prevent unauthorized and unintended information transfer via shared system resources. 1816  DISCUSSION 1817  Preventing unauthorized and unintended information transfer via shared system resources stops 1818  information produced by the actions of prior users or roles (or actions of processes acting on 1819  behalf of prior users or roles) from being available to current users or roles (or current processes 1820  acting on behalf of current users or roles) that obtain access to shared system resources after 1821  those resources have been released back to the system. Information in shared system resources 1822  also applies to encrypted representations of information. In other contexts, the control of 1823  information in shared system resources is referred to as object reuse and residual information 1824  protection. Information in shared system resources does not address information remanence, 1825  which refers to the residual representation of data that has been nominally deleted, covert 1826  channels (including storage and timing channels) in which shared system resources are 1827  manipulated to violate information flow restrictions, or components within systems for which 1828  there are only single users or roles. 1829  REFERENCES 1830  Source Controls: SC-4 1831  Supporting Publications: None 1832  3.13.5.

Split Tunneling 1845  Prevent split tunneling for remote devices unless the split tunnel is securely provisioned using 1846  [Assignment: organization-defined safeguards]. 1847  DISCUSSION 1848  Split tunneling is the process of allowing a remote user or device to establish a non-remote 1849  connection with a system and simultaneously communicate with a resource in an external 1850  network via some other connection. This method of network access enables a user to access 1851  remote devices and simultaneously access uncontrolled networks. Split tunneling may be 1852  desirable by remote users to communicate with system resources, such as printers or file 1853  servers. However, split tunneling can facilitate unauthorized external connections and make the 1854  system vulnerable to attack and the exfiltration of CUI. 1855  Split tunneling can be prevented by disabling configuration settings that allow such capabilities 1856  in remote devices and by preventing those configuration settings from being configurable by 1857  users. Prevention can also be achieved through the detection of split tunneling (or of 1858  configuration settings that allow split tunneling) in the remote device and by prohibiting the 1859  connection if the remote device is using split tunneling. A virtual private network (VPN) can be 1860  used to securely provision a split tunnel. A securely provisioned VPN includes locking 1861  connectivity to exclusive, managed, and named environments or to a specific set of pre-1862  approved addresses without user control. 1863  REFERENCES 1864  Source Controls: SC-7(7) 1865  Supporting Publications: SP 800-41 [68], SP 800-77 [19], SP 800-189 [71] 1866  3.13.8.

Internal Network Communications Traffic 1972  Route internal network communications traffic to external networks through an authenticated 1973  proxy server. 1974  DISCUSSION 1975  External networks are networks outside of organizational control. A proxy server is a server 1976  (i.e., system or application) that acts as an intermediary for clients who request system 1977  resources from non-organizational or other organizational servers. System resources that may 1978  be requested include files, connections, web pages, or services. Client requests established 1979  through a connection to a proxy server are assessed to manage complexity and provide 1980  additional protection by limiting direct connectivity. Web content filtering devices are one of 1981  the most common proxy servers that provide access to the internet.

Malicious Code Protection 2028  a. Implement malicious code protection mechanisms at designated locations within the system 2029  to detect and eradicate malicious code. 2030  b. Update malicious code protection mechanisms as new releases are available in accordance 2031  with organizational configuration management policy and procedures. 2032  DISCUSSION 2033  Malicious code insertions occur through the exploitation of system vulnerabilities. Periodic 2034  scans of the system and real-time scans of files from external sources as files are downloaded, 2035  opened, or executed can detect malicious code. Malicious code can be inserted into the system 2036  in a variety of ways, including by electronic mail, the world wide web, and portable storage 2037  devices. Malicious code includes viruses, worms, Trojan horses, and spyware. Malicious code 2038  can be encoded in various formats, contained in compressed or hidden files, or hidden in files 2039  using techniques such as steganography. In addition to the above technologies, pervasive 2040  configuration management, comprehensive software integrity controls, and anti-exploitation 2041  software may be effective in preventing the execution of unauthorized code. Malicious code 2042  may be present in commercial off-the-shelf software as well as custom-built software and could 2043  include logic bombs, backdoors, and other types of attacks that could affect organizational 2044  mission and business functions. 2045  In situations where malicious code cannot be detected by detection methods or technologies, 2046  organizations rely on other types of controls – including secure coding practices, configuration 2047  management and control, trusted procurement processes, and monitoring practices – to ensure 2048  that software does not perform functions other than the functions intended. Organizations may 2049  determine that different actions are warranted in response to the detection of malicious code. 2050  For example, organizations can define actions in response to malicious code detection during 2051  scans, the detection of malicious downloads, or the detection of maliciousness when attempting 2052  to open or execute files. 2053  REFERENCES 2054  Source Controls: SI-3 2055  Supporting Publications: SP 800-83 [80], SP 800-125B [69], SP 800-177 [74] 2056  3.14.3.

For 2061  example, the Department of Homeland Security’s Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security 2062  Agency (CISA) generates security alerts and advisories to maintain situational awareness across 2063  the Federal Government and in nonfederal organizations. Software vendors, subscription 2064  services, and industry Information Sharing and Analysis Centers (ISACs) may also provide 2065  https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/cprt/catalog#/cprt/framework/version/SP_800_53_5_1_0/home?element=SI-2 https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/cprt/catalog#/cprt/framework/version/SP_800_53_5_1_0/home?element=SI-3  NIST SP 800-171r3 ipd (Initial Public Draft)  Protecting Controlled Unclassified Information  May 2023  55  security alerts and advisories.

Monitor the system, including inbound and outbound communications traffic, to detect: 2078  1. Attacks and indicators of potential attacks; 2079  2. Unusual or unauthorized activities or conditions; and 2080  3. Unauthorized connections. 2081  b. Identify unauthorized use of the system. 2082  DISCUSSION 2083  System monitoring involves external and internal monitoring. External monitoring includes the 2084  observation of events that occur at the system boundary, while internal monitoring includes the 2085  observation of events that occur within the system. Organizations can monitor the system, for 2086  example, by observing audit record activities in real time or by observing other system aspects, 2087  such as access patterns, characteristics of access, and other actions. The monitoring objectives 2088  may guide determination of the events. 2089  A system monitoring capability is achieved through a variety of tools and techniques (e.g., audit 2090  record monitoring software, intrusion detection systems, intrusion prevention systems, 2091  malicious code protection software, scanning tools, network monitoring software). Strategic 2092  locations for monitoring devices include selected perimeter locations and near server farms that 2093  support critical applications with such devices being employed at managed system interfaces. 2094  The granularity of monitoring the information collected is based on organizational monitoring 2095  objectives and the capability of the system to support such objectives. 2096  System monitoring is an integral part of continuous monitoring and incident response programs. 2097  The output from system monitoring serves as input to continuous monitoring and incident 2098  response programs. A network connection is any connection with a device that communicates 2099  through a network (e.g., local area network, internet). A remote connection is any connection 2100  with a device that communicates through an external network (e.g., the internet). Local, 2101  network, and remote connections can be either wired or wireless. 2102  Unusual or unauthorized activities or conditions related to inbound and outbound 2103  communications traffic include internal traffic that indicates the presence of malicious code in 2104  the system or propagating among system components, the unauthorized export of information, 2105  https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/cprt/catalog#/cprt/framework/version/SP_800_53_5_1_0/home?element=SI-5  NIST SP 800-171r3 ipd (Initial Public Draft)  Protecting Controlled Unclassified Information  May 2023  56  or signaling to external systems.

Review and update the plan at [Assignment: organization-defined frequency]. 2148  DISCUSSION 2149  System security plans relate security requirements to a set of security controls. System security 2150  plans also provide a high-level description of how the controls meet those requirements but do 2151  not provide detailed descriptions of the design or implementation of the controls. System 2152  security plans contain sufficient information to enable a design and implementation that is 2153  unambiguously compliant with the intent of the plans and the subsequent determinations of risk 2154  if the plan is implemented as intended. System security plans can be a collection of documents, 2155  including documents that already exist. Effective system security plans make use of references 2156  to policies, procedures, and additional documents (e.g., design specifications) where detailed 2157  information can be obtained. This reduces the documentation requirements associated with 2158  security programs and maintains security information in other established management or 2159  operational areas related to enterprise architecture, the system development life cycle, systems 2160  engineering, and acquisition. 2161  REFERENCES 2162  Source Controls: PL-2 2163  Supporting Publications: SP 800-18 [67] 2164  3.15.3.

For legacy systems, organizations apply systems security 2182  engineering principles to system upgrades and modifications to the extent feasible, given the 2183  current state of hardware, software, and firmware components within those systems. The 2184  application of systems security engineering concepts and principles helps to develop 2185  trustworthy, secure, and resilient systems and reduce the susceptibility of organizations to 2186  disruptions, hazards, and threats. Examples include developing layered protections; establishing 2187  security policies, architecture, and controls as the foundation for design; incorporating security 2188  requirements into the system development life cycle; delineating physical and logical security 2189  boundaries; ensuring that developers are trained on how to build trustworthy secure software; 2190  and performing threat modeling to identify use cases, threat agents, attack vectors and patterns, 2191  design patterns, and compensating controls needed to mitigate risk. Organizations that apply 2192  security engineering concepts and principles can facilitate the development of trustworthy, 2193  secure systems, system components, and system services; reduce risk to acceptable levels; and 2194  make informed risk-management decisions. 2195  REFERENCES 2196  Source Controls: SA-8 2197  Supporting Publications: SP 800-160-1 [12], SP 800-160-2 [11], SP 800-207 [70] 2198  3.16.2. Unsupported System Components 2199  a. Replace system components when support for the components is no longer available from 2200  the developer, vendor, or manufacturer; or 2201  b. Provide options for alternative sources for continued support for unsupported components. 2202  DISCUSSION 2203  Support for system components includes software patches, firmware updates, replacement parts, 2204  and maintenance contracts. An example of unsupported components includes when vendors no 2205  longer provide critical software patches or product updates, which can result in an opportunity 2206  for adversaries to exploit weaknesses in the installed components. Exceptions to replacing 2207  unsupported system components include systems that provide critical mission or business 2208  capabilities where newer technologies are not available or where the systems are so isolated that 2209  installing replacement components is not an option. 2210  Alternative sources for support address the need to provide continued support for system 2211  components that are no longer supported by the original manufacturers, developers, or vendors 2212  when such components remain essential to organizational mission and business functions. If 2213  necessary, organizations can establish in-house support by developing customized patches for 2214  critical software components or, alternatively, obtain the services of external providers who 2215  provide ongoing support for the designated unsupported components through contractual 2216  relationships. Such contractual relationships can include open-source software value-added 2217  vendors. The increased risk of using unsupported system components can be mitigated, for 2218  example, by prohibiting the connection of such components to public or uncontrolled networks 2219  or implementing other forms of isolation.  2220  REFERENCES 2221  Source Controls: SA-22 2222  Supporting Publications: None 2223  https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/cprt/catalog#/cprt/framework/version/SP_800_53_5_1_0/home?element=SA-8 https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/cprt/catalog#/cprt/framework/version/SP_800_53_5_1_0/home?element=SA-22  NIST SP 800-171r3 ipd (Initial Public Draft)  Protecting Controlled Unclassified Information  May 2023  59  3.16.3. External System Services 2224  a. Require the providers of external system services to comply with organizational security 2225  requirements, and implement the following controls: [Assignment: organization-defined 2226  controls]. 2227  b. Define and document organizational oversight and user roles and responsibilities with 2228  regard to external system services. 2229  c. Implement the following processes, methods, and techniques to monitor control compliance 2230  by external service providers on an ongoing basis: [Assignment: organization-defined 2231  processes, methods, and techniques]. 2232  DISCUSSION 2233  External system services are provided by an external provider, and in most cases, the 2234  organization has no direct control over the implementation of the required controls or the 2235  assessment of control effectiveness. Organizations establish relationships with external service 2236  providers in a variety of ways, including through business partnerships, contracts, interagency 2237  agreements, lines of business arrangements, licensing agreements, joint ventures, and supply 2238  chain exchanges. The responsibility for managing risks from the use of external system services 2239  remains with the organization charged with protecting CUI. Service-level agreements define the 2240  expectations of performance for the implemented controls, describe measurable outcomes, and 2241  identify remedies, mitigations, and response requirements for identified instances of 2242  noncompliance. Information from external service providers regarding the specific functions, 2243  ports, protocols, and services used in the provision of such services can be useful when the need 2244  arises to understand the trade-offs involved in restricting certain functions and services or 2245  blocking certain ports and protocols. 2246  REFERENCES 2247  Source Controls: SA-9 2248  Supporting Publications: SP 800-160-1 [12], SP 800-161 [37] 2249  Supply Chain Risk Management 2250  3.17.1. Supply Chain Risk Management Plan 2251  a. Develop a plan for managing supply chain risks associated with the development, 2252  manufacturing, acquisition, delivery, operations, maintenance, and disposal of the system, 2253  system components, or system services. 2254  b. Review and update the plan [Assignment: organization-defined frequency]. 2255  DISCUSSION 2256  Dependence on the products, systems, and services from external providers and the nature of the 2257  relationships with those providers present an increasing level of risk to an organization. Threat 2258  actions that may increase security risks include unauthorized production, the insertion or use of 2259  counterfeits, tampering, theft, insertion of malicious software and hardware, and poor 2260  manufacturing and development practices in the supply chain. Supply chain risks can be endemic 2261  or systemic within a system, component, or service. Managing supply chain risk is a complex, 2262  multifaceted undertaking that requires a coordinated effort across an organization to build trust 2263  relationships and communicate with internal and external stakeholders. 2264  https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/cprt/catalog#/cprt/framework/version/SP_800_53_5_1_0/home?element=SA-9  NIST SP 800-171r3 ipd (Initial Public Draft)  Protecting Controlled Unclassified Information  May 2023  60  Supply chain risk management (SCRM) activities include identifying and assessing risks, 2265  determining appropriate risk response actions, developing SCRM plans to document response 2266  actions, and monitoring performance against plans. The system-level SCRM plan is 2267  implementation-specific and provides policy implementation, requirements, constraints and 2268  implications. It can either be stand-alone or incorporated into system security plans. The SCRM 2269  plan addresses the management, implementation, and monitoring of SCRM controls and the 2270  development or sustainment of systems across the SDLC to support mission and business 2271  functions. Because supply chains can differ significantly across and within organizations, SCRM 2272  plans are tailored to individual program, organizational, and operational contexts.  2273  REFERENCES 2274  Source Controls: SR-2 2275  Supporting Publications: SP 800-30 [59], SP 800-39 [64], SP 800-160-1 [12], SP 800-181 [38] 2276  3.17.2. Acquisition Strategies, Tools, and Methods 2277  Develop and implement acquisition strategies, contract tools, and procurement methods to 2278  protect against, identify, and mitigate supply chain risks. 2279  DISCUSSION 2280  The acquisition process provides an important vehicle for protecting the supply chain. There are 2281  many useful tools and techniques available, including obscuring the end use of a system or 2282  system component, using blind or filtered buys, requiring tamper-evident packaging, or using 2283  trusted or controlled distribution. The results from a supply chain risk assessment can inform 2284  the strategies, tools, and methods that are most applicable to the situation. Tools and techniques 2285  may provide protections against unauthorized production, theft, tampering, the insertion of 2286  counterfeits, the insertion of malicious software or backdoors, and poor development practices 2287  throughout the system life cycle. 2288  Organizations also consider providing incentives for suppliers to implement controls, promote 2289  transparency in their processes and security practices, provide contract language that addresses 2290  the prohibition of tainted or counterfeit components, and restrict purchases from untrustworthy 2291  suppliers. Organizations consider providing training, education, and awareness programs for 2292  personnel regarding supply chain risk, available mitigation strategies, and when the programs 2293  should be employed. Methods for reviewing and protecting development plans, documentation, 2294  and evidence are commensurate with the security requirements of the organization. Contracts 2295  may specify documentation protection requirements. 2296  REFERENCES 2297  Source Controls: SR-5 2298  Supporting Publications: SP 800-30 [59], SP 800-161 [37] 2299  3.17.3.

Supply chain processes 2309  include hardware, software, and firmware development processes; shipping and handling 2310  procedures; personnel security and physical security programs; configuration management 2311  tools, techniques, and measures to maintain provenance; or other programs, processes, or 2312  procedures associated with the development, acquisition, maintenance and disposal of systems 2313  and system components. Supply chain elements and processes may be provided by 2314  organizations, system integrators, or external providers. Weaknesses or deficiencies in supply 2315  chain elements or processes represent potential vulnerabilities that can be exploited by 2316  adversaries to harm the organization and affect its ability to carry out its core missions or 2317  business functions. 2318  REFERENCES 2319  Source Controls: SR-3 2320  Supporting Publications: SP 800-30 [59], SP 800-161 [37] 2321  3.17.4. Component Disposal 2322  Dispose of system components, documentation, or tools containing CUI using the following 2323  techniques and methods: [Assignment: organization-defined techniques and methods]. 2324  DISCUSSION 2325  Data, documentation, tools, or system components can be disposed of at any time during the 2326  system development life cycle (not only in the disposal or retirement phase of the life cycle). 2327  For example, disposal can occur during research and development, design, prototyping, 2328  operations, or maintenance and include methods such as disk cleaning, the removal of 2329  cryptographic keys, the partial reuse of components. Opportunities for compromise during 2330  disposal affect physical and logical data, including system documentation in paper-based or 2331  digital files, shipping and delivery documentation, memory sticks with software code, or 2332  complete routers or servers that include permanent media that contain sensitive or proprietary 2333  information. Additionally, the proper disposal of system components helps to prevent such 2334  components from entering the gray market. 2335  REFERENCES 2336  Source Controls: SR-12 2337  Supporting Publications: SP 800-30 [59], SP 800-161 [37]  2338  https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/cprt/catalog#/cprt/framework/version/SP_800_53_5_1_0/home?element=SR-3 https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/cprt/catalog#/cprt/framework/version/SP_800_53_5_1_0/home?element=SR-12  NIST SP 800-171r3 ipd (Initial Public Draft)  Protecting Controlled Unclassified Information  May 2023  62  References 2339  [1] Executive Order 13556 (2010) Controlled Unclassified Information.

This  publication provides agencies with recommended security requirements for protecting the  confidentiality of CUI when the information is resident in nonfederal systems and organizations,  when the nonfederal organization is not collecting or maintaining information on behalf of a  federal agency or using or operating a system on behalf of an agency, and where there are no  specific safeguarding requirements for protecting the confidentiality of CUI prescribed by the  authorizing law, regulation, or governmentwide policy for the CUI category listed in the CUI  Registry. The requirements apply to components of nonfederal systems that process, store, or  transmit CUI or that provide protection for such components. The security requirements are  intended for use by federal agencies in contractual vehicles or other agreements established  between those agencies and nonfederal organizations.

ITL develops tests, test  methods, reference data, proof of concept implementations, and technical analyses to advance  the development and productive use of information technology. ITL’s responsibilities include the  development of management, administrative, technical, and physical standards and guidelines for  the cost-effective security and privacy of other than national security-related information in  federal information systems. The Special Publication 800-series reports on ITL’s research,  guidelines, and outreach efforts in information system security, and its collaborative activities  with industry, government, and academic organizations.  NIST SP 800-171r3 ipd (Initial Public Draft)  Protecting Controlled Unclassified Information  May 2023  ii  Audience  This publication serves a diverse group of individuals and organizations in the public and private  sectors, including individuals with:  • System development life cycle responsibilities (e.g., program managers, mission/business  owners, information owners/stewards, system designers and developers, system/security  engineers, systems integrators)  • Acquisition or procurement responsibilities (e.g., contracting officers)  • System, security, or risk management and oversight responsibilities (e.g., authorizing  officials, chief information officers, chief information security officers, system owners,  information security managers)  • Security assessment and monitoring responsibilities (e.g., auditors, system evaluators,  assessors, independent verifiers/validators, analysts)  The above roles and responsibilities can be viewed from two perspectives:  • Federal perspective: The entity establishing and conveying the security requirements in  contractual vehicles or other types of agreements  • Nonfederal perspective: The entity responding to and complying with the security  requirements set forth in contracts or agreements  NIST SP 800-171r3 ipd (Initial Public Draft)  Protecting Controlled Unclassified Information  May 2023  iii  Note to Reviewers  This update to NIST Special Publication (SP) 800-171 represents over one year of data  collection, technical analysis, customer interaction, redesign, and development of the security  requirements and supporting information for the protection of Controlled Unclassified  Information (CUI). Many trade-offs have been made to ensure that the technical and non- technical requirements have been stated clearly and concisely, while at the same time  recognizing the specific needs of both federal and nonfederal organizations. The following  provides a summary of the significant changes that have been made to NIST SP 800-171 in  transitioning from Revision 2 to Revision 3:  • Streamlined introductory information in Section 1 and Section 2 to improve clarity and  customer understanding  • Modified the security requirements and families in Section 3 to reflect the controls in the  NIST SP 800-53B [13] moderate baseline and the tailoring actions in Appendix C  • Eliminated the distinction between basic and derived security requirements  • Increased the specificity of security requirements to remove ambiguity, improve the  effectiveness of implementation, and clarify the scope of assessments  • Introduced organization-defined parameters (ODP) in selected security requirements to  increase flexibility and help organizations better manage risk  • Grouped security requirements, where possible, to improve understanding and efficiency  of implementation and assessments  • Removed outdated and redundant security requirements  • Added titles to security requirements  • Introduced a new tailoring category, Not Applicable (NA)  • Recategorized selected controls in the NIST SP 800-53B moderate baseline (using the  tailoring criteria in Appendix C)  • Recast the security requirements, where possible, for consistency with the security  control language in NIST SP 800-53  • Developed a prototype CUI overlay that expresses security requirements using the  tailored security controls in NIST SP 800-53  • Revised the structure of the References, Acronyms, and Glossary sections for greater  clarity and ease of use  • Revised the tailoring table in Appendix C for consistency with the changes to the security  requirements  • Transitioned the mapping tables formerly resident in Appendix D of NIST SP 800-171,  Revision 2 to the publication details web page along with other supporting material  Information regarding the transition of security requirements from NIST SP 800-171, Revision 2  to Revision 3 can be found on the publication details web page.  https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800-171/rev-3/draft https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800-171/rev-3/draft https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800-171/rev-3/draft  NIST SP 800-171r3 ipd (Initial Public Draft)  Protecting Controlled Unclassified Information  May 2023  iv  NIST is specifically interested in comments, feedback, and recommendations for the following  topics:  • Re-categorized controls (e.g., controls formerly categorized as NFO)  • Inclusion of organization-defined parameters (ODP)  • Prototype CUI overlay  Reviewers are encouraged to comment on all or parts of draft NIST SP 800-171, Revision 3.

The authors also wish to thank  the NIST technical editing and production staff – Jim Foti, Jeff Brewer, and Isabel Van Wyk –  for their outstanding support in preparing this document for publication and Kelley Dempsey for  the initial research and development of the technical content used in the prototype CUI overlay.  Historical Contributions  The authors also wish to acknowledge the following organizations and individuals for their  historic contributions to this publication:  Organizations: National Archives and Records Administration, Department of Defense  Individuals: Carol Bales, Matthew Barrett, Jon Boyens, Devin Casey, Christian Enloe, Gary  Guissanie, Peggy Himes, Robert Glenn, Elizabeth Lennon, Vicki Michetti, Dorian Pappas, Karen  Quigg, Mark Riddle, Matthew Scholl, Mary Thomas, Murugiah Souppaya, Patricia Toth, and  Patrick Viscuso  NIST SP 800-171r3 ipd (Initial Public Draft)  Protecting Controlled Unclassified Information  May 2023  1  Introduction  1  Executive Order (EO) 13556 [1] established a governmentwide program to standardize the way 2  the executive branch handles Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI).1 EO 13556 required 3  that the CUI program emphasize openness, transparency, and uniformity of governmentwide 4  practices and that the program implementation take place in a manner consistent with Office of 5  Management and Budget (OMB) policies and National Institute of Standards and Technology 6  (NIST) standards and guidelines. As the CUI program Executive Agent, the National Archives 7  and Records Administration (NARA) provides information, guidance, policy, and requirements 8  on handling CUI [4]. This includes approved CUI categories and descriptions, the basis for 9  safeguarding and dissemination controls, and procedures for the use of CUI.2 The CUI federal 10  regulation [5] provides guidance to federal agencies on the designation, safeguarding, marking, 11  dissemination, decontrolling, and disposition of CUI; establishes self-inspection and oversight 12  requirements; and delineates other facets of the program. 13  The CUI regulation requires federal agencies that use federal information systems3 to process, 14  store, or transmit CUI to comply with NIST standards and guidelines. The responsibility of 15  federal agencies to protect CUI does not change when such information is shared with nonfederal 16  organizations.4 Therefore, a similar level of protection is needed when CUI is processed, stored, 17  or transmitted by nonfederal organizations using nonfederal systems.5 The security requirements 18  for safeguarding CUI in nonfederal systems and organizations are derived from FIPS 199 [6], 19  FIPS 200 [7], and NIST SP 800-53 [8] to maintain a consistent level of protection. 20  Purpose and Applicability 21  The purpose of this publication is to provide federal agencies with recommended security 22  requirements6 for protecting the confidentiality of CUI:7 23  • When the CUI is resident in a nonfederal system and organization 24  • When the nonfederal organization is not collecting or maintaining information on behalf 25  of a federal agency or using or operating a system on behalf of an agency8 26  1 CUI is any information that law, regulation, or governmentwide policy requires to have safeguarding or disseminating controls, excluding  information that is classified under E.O. 13526 [2] or any predecessor or successor order, or the Atomic Energy Act [3] as amended.  2 Procedures for the use of CUI include marking, safeguarding, transporting, disseminating, reusing, and disposing of the information.  3 An information system is a discrete set of information resources organized expressly for the collection, processing, maintenance, use, sharing,  dissemination, or disposition of information. Information systems also include specialized systems, such as industrial/process control systems,  cyber-physical systems, embedded systems, and devices. A federal information system is a system that is used or operated by an executive  agency, by a contractor of an executive agency, or by another organization on behalf of an executive agency. The term system is used in this  publication to represent all types of computing platforms that can process, store, or transmit CUI.  4 A nonfederal organization is any entity that owns, operates, or maintains a nonfederal system.  5 A nonfederal system is any system that does not meet the criteria for a federal information system.  6 The term security requirements refers to the protection needs for a system or organization. Security requirements may be derived from many  sources (e.g., laws, Executive Orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, mission and business needs, or risk assessments).  7 In accordance with E.O. 13526 [2] and 32 CFR 2002 [5], the scope of CUI protection is limited to confidentiality. However, the security  objectives of confidentiality and integrity are closely related since many of the underlying security mechanisms at the system level support both  objectives. Therefore, the security requirements in this publication address the protection of CUI from unauthorized disclosure and modification.  8 Nonfederal organizations that collect or maintain information on behalf of a federal agency or that use or operate a system on behalf of an  agency must comply with the requirements in FISMA [9].  NIST SP 800-171r3 ipd (Initial Public Draft)  Protecting Controlled Unclassified Information  May 2023  2  • Where there are no specific safeguarding requirements for protecting the confidentiality 27  of CUI prescribed by the authorizing law, regulation, or governmentwide policy for the 28  CUI category listed in the CUI registry 29  The security requirements in this publication are only applicable to components of nonfederal 30  systems9 that process, store, or transmit CUI or that provide protection for such components.10 31  The requirements are intended for use by federal agencies in contractual vehicles or other 32  agreements that are established between those agencies and nonfederal organizations. 33  Organization of This Publication 34  The remainder of this special publication is organized as follows: 35  • Section 2 describes the assumptions and methodology used to develop the security 36  requirements for protecting the confidentiality of CUI; the format of the requirements; 37  and the tailoring criteria applied to the NIST standards and guidelines to obtain the 38  requirements. 39  • Section 3 lists the security requirements for protecting the confidentiality of CUI in 40  nonfederal systems and organizations. 41  The following sections provide additional information to support the protection of CUI in 42  nonfederal systems and organizations: 43  • References 44  • Appendix A: Acronyms 45  • Appendix B: Glossary 46  • Appendix C: Tailoring Criteria 47  • Appendix D: Change Log  48  9 Nonfederal systems include information technology (IT) systems, operational technology (OT) systems, and Internet of Things (IoT) devices.  NIST SP 800-82 [10] provides guidance for mitigating risks to OT systems.  10 System components include workstations, servers, notebook computers, smartphones, tablets, input and output devices, network components,  operating systems, virtual machines, database management systems, and applications.  NIST SP 800-171r3 ipd (Initial Public Draft)  Protecting Controlled Unclassified Information  May 2023  3  The Fundamentals 49  This section describes the basic assumptions and methodology used to develop the requirements 50  to protect the confidentiality of CUI in nonfederal systems and organizations. It also includes the 51  tailoring11 criteria applied to the requirements and controls in FIPS 200 [7] and NIST SP 800-53 52  [8].  53  Basic Assumptions 54  The recommended security requirements in this publication are based on the following 55  assumptions: 56  • Federal information designated as CUI has the same value, whether such information 57  resides in a federal or a nonfederal system or organization. 58  • Statutory and regulatory requirements for the protection of CUI are consistent in federal 59  and nonfederal systems and organizations. 60  • Safeguards implemented to protect CUI are consistent in federal and nonfederal systems 61  and organizations. 62  • The confidentiality impact value for CUI is no less than moderate.12 63  Security Requirement Development Methodology 64  Starting with the NIST SP 800-53 security controls in the NIST SP 800-53B [13] moderate 65  control baseline, which satisfy the minimum-security requirements in FIPS 200, the controls are 66  tailored to eliminate selected controls or parts of controls that are: 67  • Primarily the responsibility of the Federal Government 68  • Not directly related to protecting the confidentiality of CUI 69  • Expected to be implemented by nonfederal organizations without specification by the 70  Federal Government 71  The NIST SP 800-171 security requirements represent a subset of the controls that are necessary 72  for a comprehensive information security program. The security requirements are organized into 73  17 families, as illustrated in Table 1. Each family contains the particular requirements related to 74  the general security topic of the family. Certain families from NIST SP 800-53 are not included 75  due to the aforementioned tailoring criteria.13 76  11 The term tailoring is the process by which security and privacy control baselines are modified to achieve certain organizational goals and  objectives [13].  12 In accordance with 32 CFR 2002 [5], CUI is categorized at no less than the moderate confidentiality impact value as defined in FIPS 199 [6].  However, when federal law, regulation, or governmentwide policy establishing the control of CUI specifies controls that differ from those of the  moderate confidentiality baseline, then these will be followed.  13 The PII Processing and Transparency (PT) family is not included because PII is a category of CUI, and therefore, no additional requirements  are specified for confidentiality protection. The Program Management (PM) family is not included because it is not associated with any security  control baseline.

These ODPs 79  provide additional flexibility by allowing federal organizations to specify values for the 80  designated parameters, as needed. Flexibility is achieved using assignment and selection 81  operations. The assignment and selection operations provide the capability to customize the 82  requirements based on organizational protection needs. Determination of organization-defined 83  parameter values can be guided and informed by laws, Executive Orders, directives, regulations, 84  policies, standards, guidance, or mission and business needs. Once specified, the values for the 85  organization-defined parameters become part of the requirement. 86  A discussion section is included with each requirement. It is derived from the controls discussion 87  sections in NIST SP 800-53 and provides additional information to facilitate the implementation 88  and assessment of the requirements. The discussion section is informative, not normative. It is 89  not intended to extend the scope of a requirement or to influence the solutions that organizations 90  may use to satisfy a requirement. The use of examples is notional, not exhaustive and not 91  reflective of potential options available to organizations. A references section provides the 92  source controls from NIST SP 800-53 and a list of NIST Special Publications with additional 93  information on the topic described in the security requirement. 94  The structure and content of a typical security requirement is provided in the example below: 95  3.1.8  Unsuccessful Logon Attempts 96  Limit the number of consecutive invalid logon attempts by a user to [Assignment: organization-97  defined number] in [Assignment: organization-defined time period]. 98  DISCUSSION 99  Due to the potential for denial of service, automatic system lockouts are in most cases, temporary and 100  automatically release after a predetermined period established by the organization (i.e., using a delay 101  algorithm). Organizations may employ different delay algorithms for different system components based on 102  the capabilities of the respective components. Responses to unsuccessful system logon attempts may be 103  implemented at the system and application levels. 104  REFERENCES 105  Source Controls: AC-7 106  Supporting Publications: SP 800-63-3 [28], SP 800-124 [29] 107  Appendix C provides a list of the controls from NIST SP 800-53 that support the security 108  requirements and those controls that have been eliminated from the moderate baseline based on 109  the tailoring criteria. 110  https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/cprt/catalog#/cprt/framework/version/SP_800_53_5_1_0/home?element=AC-7  NIST SP 800-171r3 ipd (Initial Public Draft)  Protecting Controlled Unclassified Information  May 2023  5  The Requirements 111  This section describes 17 families of security requirements for protecting the confidentiality of 112  CUI in nonfederal systems and organizations. When used in the context of the requirements in 113  Section 3, the term system means a nonfederal system that processes, stores, or transmits CUI. 114  Access Control 115  3.1.1. Account Management 116  a. Define and document the types of system accounts allowed and prohibited. 117  b. Create, enable, modify, disable, and remove accounts in accordance with [Assignment: 118  organization-defined policy, procedures, prerequisites, and criteria]. 119  c. Specify authorized users of the system, group and role membership, and access 120  authorizations (i.e., privileges). 121  d. Authorize access to the system based on a valid access authorization and intended system 122  usage. 123  e. Monitor the use of accounts. 124  f. Disable accounts of individuals within [Assignment: organization-defined time period] when 125  the accounts:  126  1. Have expired; 127  2. Are no longer associated with a user or individual; 128  3. Are in violation of organizational policy; or 129  4. Have been inactive for [Assignment: organization-defined time period]. 130  g. Disable accounts of individuals within [Assignment: organization-defined time period] of 131  discovery of [Assignment: organization-defined significant risks]. 132  h. Notify [Assignment: organization-defined personnel or roles] within [Assignment: 133  organization-defined time period]: 134  1. When accounts are no longer required; 135  2. When users are terminated or transferred; and 136  3. When system usage or need-to-know changes for an individual. 137  DISCUSSION 138  This requirement focuses on account management for systems and applications. The definition of 139  and enforcement of access authorizations other than those determined by account type (e.g., 140  privileged access, non-privileged access) are addressed in requirement 3.1.2. System account 141  types include individual, shared, group, temporary, system, guest, anonymous, emergency, 142  developer, and service. Users who require administrative privileges on system accounts receive 143  additional scrutiny by organizational personnel responsible for approving such accounts and 144  privileged access. Types of accounts that organizations may prohibit due to increased risk include 145  shared, group, emergency, guest, anonymous, and temporary. 146  Organizations may choose to define access privileges or other attributes by account, by type of 147  account, or a combination of both. Other attributes required for authorizing access include 148  restrictions on time-of-day, day-of-week, and point-of-origin. In defining other account attributes, 149  NIST SP 800-171r3 ipd (Initial Public Draft)  Protecting Controlled Unclassified Information  May 2023  6  organizations consider system-related requirements (e.g., system upgrades, scheduled 150  maintenance) and mission and business requirements (e.g., time zone differences, remote access 151  to support travel requirements). 152  Users who pose a significant security risk include individuals for whom reliable evidence 153  indicates either the intention to use authorized access to the system to cause harm or that 154  adversaries will cause harm through them. Close coordination among human resource managers, 155  system administrators, legal staff, and human resource managers is essential when disabling 156  system accounts for high-risk individuals. Time periods for notification of organizational 157  personnel or roles may vary. 158  REFERENCES 159  Source Controls: AC-2, AC-2(3), AC-2(13) 160  Supporting Publications: SP 800-46 [15], SP 800-57-1 [16], SP 800-57-2 [17], SP 800-57-3 [18], 161  SP 800-77 [19], SP 800-113 [20], SP 800-114 [21], SP 800-121 [22], SP 800-162 [23], SP 800-162  178 [24], SP 800-192 [25], IR 7874 [26], IR 7966 [27] 163  3.1.2. Access Enforcement 164  Enforce approved authorizations for logical access to CUI and system resources in accordance 165  with applicable access control policies. 166  DISCUSSION 167  Access control policies control access between active entities or subjects (i.e., users or processes 168  acting on behalf of users) and passive entities or objects (i.e., devices, files, records, domains) in 169  organizational systems. Types of system access include remote access and access to systems that 170  communicate through external networks, such as the internet. Access enforcement mechanisms 171  can also be employed at the application and service level to provide increased protection for CUI. 172  This recognizes that the system can host many applications and services in support of mission and 173  business functions. 174  REFERENCES 175  Source Controls: AC-3, AC-17 176  Supporting Publications: SP 800-46 [15], SP 800-57-1 [16], SP 800-57-2 [17], SP 800-57-3 [18], 177  SP 800-77 [19], SP 800-113 [20], SP 800-114 [21], SP 800-121 [22], SP 800-162 [23], SP 800-178  178 [24], SP 800-192 [25], IR 7874 [26], IR 7966 [27] 179  3.1.3. Flow Enforcement 180  Enforce approved authorizations for controlling the flow of CUI within the system and between 181  connected systems. 182  DISCUSSION 183  Information flow control regulates where information can transit within a system and between 184  systems (versus who can access the information) and without explicit regard to subsequent 185  accesses to that information. Flow control restrictions include the following: keeping export-186  controlled information from being transmitted in the clear to the internet, blocking outside traffic 187  that claims to be from within the organization, restricting requests to the internet that are not from 188  the internal web proxy server, and limiting information transfers between organizations based on 189  data structures and content. 190  https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/cprt/catalog#/cprt/framework/version/SP_800_53_5_1_0/home?element=AC-2 https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/cprt/catalog#/cprt/framework/version/SP_800_53_5_1_0/home?element=AC-2 https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/cprt/catalog#/cprt/framework/version/SP_800_53_5_1_0/home?element=AC-2 https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/cprt/catalog#/cprt/framework/version/SP_800_53_5_1_0/home?element=AC-3 https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/cprt/catalog#/cprt/framework/version/SP_800_53_5_1_0/home?element=AC-17  NIST SP 800-171r3 ipd (Initial Public Draft)  Protecting Controlled Unclassified Information  May 2023  7  Organizations commonly use information flow control policies and enforcement mechanisms to 191  control the flow of information between designated sources and destinations (e.g., networks, 192  individuals, and devices) within systems and between interconnected systems. Flow control is 193  based on characteristics of the information or the information path. Enforcement occurs in 194  boundary protection devices (e.g., encrypted tunnels, routers, gateways, and firewalls) that 195  employ rule sets or establish configuration settings that restrict system services, provide a packet-196  filtering capability based on header information, or provide a message-filtering capability based 197  on message content (e.g., implementing key word searches or using document characteristics). 198  Organizations also consider the trustworthiness of filtering and inspection mechanisms (i.e., 199  hardware, firmware, and software components) that are critical to information flow enforcement. 200  Transferring information between systems that represent different security domains with different 201  security policies introduces risk that such transfers violate one or more domain security policies. 202  In such situations, information owners or stewards provide guidance at designated policy 203  enforcement points between interconnected systems. Organizations consider mandating specific 204  architectural solutions when required to enforce specific security policies. Enforcement includes 205  prohibiting information transfers between interconnected systems (i.e., allowing information 206  access only), employing hardware mechanisms to enforce one-way information flows, and 207  implementing trustworthy regrading mechanisms to reassign security attributes and security 208  labels. 209  REFERENCES 210  Source Controls: AC-4 211  Supporting Publications: SP 800-160-1 [12], SP 800-162 [23], SP 800-178 [24] 212  3.1.4. Separation of Duties 213  a. Identify the duties of individuals requiring separation. 214  b. Define system access authorizations to support separation of duties. 215  DISCUSSION 216  Separation of duties addresses the potential for abuse of authorized privileges and helps reduce 217  the risk of malevolent activity without collusion. Separation of duties includes dividing mission 218  functions and support functions among different individuals or roles, conducting system support 219  functions with different individuals or roles (e.g., quality assurance, configuration management, 220  testing, system management, programming, and network security), and ensuring that security 221  personnel who administer access control functions do not also administer audit functions. 222  Because separation of duty violations can span systems and application domains, organizations 223  consider the entirety of their systems and system components when developing policies on 224  separation of duties. 225  REFERENCES 226  Source Controls: AC-5 227  Supporting Publications: SP 800-162 [23], SP 800-178 [24] 228  3.1.5.

Reassign or remove privileges, as necessary. 236  DISCUSSION 237  Organizations employ the principle of least privilege for specific duties and authorized access for 238  users and processes. Security functions include establishing system accounts, configuring access 239  authorizations (i.e., permissions, privileges), configuring settings for events to be audited, and 240  establishing intrusion detection parameters. Security-relevant information includes filtering rules 241  for routers or firewalls, configuration parameters for security services, cryptographic key 242  management information, and access control lists. Authorized personnel include security 243  administrators, system administrators, system security officers, system programmers, and other 244  privileged users. Organizations consider creating additional processes, roles, and system accounts 245  to achieve least privilege. Least privilege is also applied to the development, implementation, and 246  operation of the system. 247  REFERENCES 248  Source Controls: AC-6, AC-6(1), AC-6(7) 249  Supporting Publications: None 250  3.1.6. Least Privilege – Privileged Accounts  251  a. Restrict privileged accounts on the system to [Assignment: organization-defined personnel or 252  roles]. 253  b. Require that users of system accounts (or roles) with access to [Assignment: organization-254  defined security functions or security-relevant information] use non-privileged accounts or 255  roles when accessing nonsecurity functions. 256  DISCUSSION 257  Privileged accounts, including super user accounts, are typically described as system 258  administrator accounts for various types of commercial off-the-shelf operating systems. 259  Restricting privileged accounts to specific personnel or roles prevents nonprivileged users from 260  accessing privileged information or privileged functions. In restricting privileged accounts, 261  organizations may differentiate between allowed privileges for local accounts and domain 262  accounts provided that they retain the ability to control system configurations for key parameters 263  and as otherwise necessary to sufficiently mitigate risk. 264  Requiring the use of non-privileged accounts when accessing nonsecurity functions limits 265  exposure when operating from within privileged accounts or roles. The inclusion of roles 266  addresses situations in which organizations implement access control policies, such as role-based 267  access control, and where a change of role provides the same degree of assurance in the change of 268  access authorizations for the user and the processes acting on behalf of the user as would be 269  provided by a change between a privileged and non-privileged account. 270  REFERENCES 271  Source Controls: AC-6(2), AC-6(5) 272  Supporting Publications: None 273  https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/cprt/catalog#/cprt/framework/version/SP_800_53_5_1_0/home?element=AC-6 https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/cprt/catalog#/cprt/framework/version/SP_800_53_5_1_0/home?element=AC-6 https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/cprt/catalog#/cprt/framework/version/SP_800_53_5_1_0/home?element=AC-6 https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/cprt/catalog#/cprt/framework/version/SP_800_53_5_1_0/home?element=AC-6 https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/cprt/catalog#/cprt/framework/version/SP_800_53_5_1_0/home?element=AC-6  NIST SP 800-171r3 ipd (Initial Public Draft)  Protecting Controlled Unclassified Information  May 2023  9  3.1.7. Least Privilege – Privileged Functions 274  a. Prevent non-privileged users from executing privileged functions. 275  b. Log the execution of privileged functions. 276  DISCUSSION 277  Privileged functions include establishing system accounts, performing system integrity checks, 278  conducting patching operations, or administering cryptographic key management activities. Non-279  privileged users do not possess appropriate authorizations. Circumventing intrusion detection and 280  prevention mechanisms or malicious code protection mechanisms are examples of privileged 281  functions that require protection from non-privileged users. Note that this requirement represents 282  a condition to be achieved by the definition of authorized privileges in 3.1.2. 283  The misuse of privileged functions – whether intentionally or unintentionally by authorized users 284  or by unauthorized external entities that have compromised system accounts – is a serious and 285  ongoing concern that can have significant adverse impacts on organizations. Logging the use of 286  privileged functions is one way to detect such misuse and mitigate the risk from insider threats 287  and advanced persistent threats. 288  REFERENCES 289  Source Controls: AC-6(9), AC-6(10) 290  Supporting Publications: None 291  3.1.8.

Conceal, via the device lock, information previously visible on the display with a publicly 325  viewable image. 326  DISCUSSION 327  Device locks are temporary actions taken to prevent access to the system when users depart 328  from the immediate vicinity of the system but do not want to log out because of the temporary 329  nature of their absences. Device locks can be implemented at the operating system or 330  application level. User-initiated device locking is behavior- or policy-based and requires users 331  to take physical action to initiate the device lock. Device locks are not an acceptable substitute 332  for logging out of the system, such as when organizations require users to log out at the end of 333  workdays.

Session Termination 340  Terminate a user session automatically after [Assignment: organization-defined conditions or 341  trigger events]. 342  DISCUSSION 343  This requirement addresses the termination of user-initiated logical sessions in contrast to the 344  termination of network connections that are associated with communications sessions (i.e., 345  disconnecting from the network) in 3.13.9. A logical session is initiated whenever a user (or 346  process acting on behalf of a user) accesses a system. Such sessions can be terminated (and 347  terminate user access) without terminating network sessions. Session termination terminates all 348  processes associated with a user’s logical session except those processes that are specifically 349  created by the user (i.e., session owner) to continue after the session is terminated.

Authorize remote execution of privileged commands and remote access to security-relevant 362  information. 363  e. Implement cryptographic mechanisms to protect the confidentiality of remote access 364  sessions. 365  DISCUSSION 366  Remote access to the system represents a significant potential vulnerability that can be exploited 367  by adversaries. Monitoring and controlling remote access methods allows organizations to 368  detect attacks and help ensure compliance with remote access policies. This occurs by auditing 369  the connection activities of remote users on a variety of systems, including servers, notebook 370  computers, workstations, smart phones, and tablets. Routing remote access through managed 371  access control points enhances explicit control over such connections. It also reduces the 372  susceptibility to unauthorized access to the system which could result in the unauthorized 373  disclosure of CUI. 374  Restricting the execution of privileged commands and access to security-relevant information 375  via remote access reduces the exposure of the organization and its susceptibility to threats by 376  adversaries. A privileged command is a human-initiated command executed on a system that 377  involves the control, monitoring, or administration of the system, including security functions 378  and security-relevant information. Security-relevant information is information that can 379  potentially impact the operation of security functions or the provision of security services in a 380  manner that could result in failure to enforce the system security policy or maintain isolation of 381  code and data. Privileged commands give individuals the ability to execute sensitive, security-382  critical, or security-relevant system functions. Controlling access from remote locations helps to 383  ensure that unauthorized individuals are not able to execute such commands with the potential 384  to do serious or catastrophic damage to the system. 385  REFERENCES 386  Source Controls: AC-17, AC-17(1), AC-17(3), AC-17(4) 387  Supporting Publications: SP 800-46 [15], SP 800-77 [19], SP 800-113 [20], SP 800-114 [21], 388  SP 800-121 [22], IR 7966 [27] 389  3.1.13.

In addition, organizations provide 562  system developers, enterprise architects, security architects, acquisition/procurement officials, 563  software developers, system developers, systems integrators, system and network administrators, 564  personnel conducting configuration management and auditing activities, personnel performing 565  independent verification and validation, security assessors, and personnel with access to system-566  level software with security-related technical training specifically tailored for their assigned 567  duties. 568  Comprehensive role-based training addresses management, operational, and technical roles and 569  responsibilities that cover physical, personnel, and technical controls. Such training can include 570  policies, procedures, tools, and artifacts for the security roles defined.

Advanced Literacy Training 577  Provide literacy training on recognizing and reporting potential and actual indicators of insider 578  threat, social engineering, and social mining. 579  DISCUSSION 580  Potential indicators and possible precursors of insider threat include behaviors such as inordinate, 581  long-term job dissatisfaction; attempts to gain access to information that is not required for job 582  performance; unexplained access to financial resources; bullying or sexual harassment of fellow 583  employees; workplace violence; and other serious violations of the policies, procedures, 584  directives, rules, or practices of organizations. Security awareness training includes how to 585  communicate employee and management concerns regarding potential indicators of insider threat 586  through appropriate organizational channels in accordance with established organizational 587  policies and procedures. Organizations may consider tailoring insider threat awareness topics to 588  the role (e.g., training for managers may be focused on specific changes in the behavior of team 589  members, while training for employees may be focused on more general observations). 590  Social engineering is an attempt to deceive an individual into revealing information or taking an 591  action that can be used to breach, compromise, or otherwise adversely impact a system.

Event Logging 603  a. Specify the following event types for logging within the system: [Assignment: organization-604  defined event types]. 605  b. Review and update the event types selected for logging [Assignment: organization-defined 606  frequency]. 607  DISCUSSION 608  An event is any observable occurrence in a system, which includes unlawful or unauthorized 609  system activity. Organizations identify event types for which a logging functionality is needed as 610  those events that are significant and relevant to the security of systems and the environments in 611  which those systems operate to meet specific and ongoing auditing needs. Event types can 612  include password changes, failed logons or failed accesses related to systems, administrative 613  privilege usage, or third-party credential usage. In determining event types that require logging, 614  organizations consider the system monitoring and auditing that are appropriate for each of the 615  CUI security requirements. When defining event types, organizations consider the logging 616  necessary to cover related events, such as the steps in distributed, transaction-based processes 617  (e.g., processes that are distributed across multiple organizations) and actions that occur in 618  service-oriented or cloud-based architectures. Monitoring and auditing requirements can be 619  balanced with other system needs. For example, organizations may determine that systems must 620  have the capability to log every file access, both successful and unsuccessful, but not activate that 621  capability except for specific circumstances due to the potential burden on system performance. 622  The event types that are logged by organizations may change over time. Periodically reviewing 623  and updating the set of logged event types is necessary to ensure that the current set remains 624  necessary and sufficient.  625  REFERENCES 626  Source Controls: AU-2 627  Supporting Publications: SP 800-92 [39] 628  3.3.2.

Selecting the appropriate level of abstraction is a critical 651  aspect of an audit logging capability and can facilitate the identification of root causes to 652  problems. The ability to add information generated in audit records is dependent on system 653  functionality to configure the audit record content. Organizations may consider additional 654  information in audit records including access control or flow control rules invoked and individual 655  identities of group account users. Organizations may also consider limiting additional audit 656  record information to only information that is explicitly needed for audit requirements. 657  REFERENCES 658  Source Controls: AU-11, AU-12 659  Supporting Publications: SP 800-92 [39] 660  3.3.4.

Findings can be reported to organizational entities that 692  include the incident response team, help desk, and security or privacy offices. If organizations are 693  prohibited from reviewing and analyzing audit records or unable to conduct such activities, the 694  review or analysis may be carried out by other organizations granted such authority. The scope, 695  frequency, and/or depth of the audit record review, analysis, and reporting may be adjusted to 696  meet organizational needs based on new information received.

Time is commonly expressed in 730  Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) – a modern continuation of Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) – 731  or local time with an offset from UTC. The granularity of time measurements refers to the degree 732  of synchronization between system clocks and reference clocks (e.g., clocks synchronizing within 733  hundreds of milliseconds or tens of milliseconds). Organizations may define different time 734  granularities for different system components. Time service can be critical to other security 735  capabilities, such as access control, and identification and authentication, depending on the nature 736  of the mechanisms used to support those capabilities. 737  REFERENCES 738  Source Controls: AU-8, SC-45, SC-45(1) 739  Supporting Publications: None 740  3.3.8.

Review the system [Assignment: organization-defined frequency] to identify and 871  disable/remove functions, ports, protocols, software, and/or services identified in 3.4.6b. 872  DISCUSSION 873  Systems can provide a variety of functions and services. Some functions and services that are 874  routinely provided by default may not be necessary to support essential organizational missions, 875  functions, or operations. It may be convenient to provide multiple services from single system 876  components. However, doing so increases risk over limiting the services provided by any one 877  component. Where feasible, organizations limit functionality to a single function per component. 878  Organizations review the functions and services provided by systems or system components to 879  determine which functions and services are candidates for elimination. Organizations disable 880  unused or unnecessary physical and logical ports and protocols to prevent the unauthorized 881  connection of devices, the transfer of information, and tunneling. Organizations can utilize 882  network scanning tools, intrusion detection and prevention systems, and end-point protections 883  (e.g., firewalls and host-based intrusion detection systems) to identify and prevent the use of 884  prohibited functions, ports, protocols, and services. 885  Restricting the use of nonessential software (programs) includes restricting the roles allowed to 886  approve program execution, prohibiting auto-execute, and restricting the number of program 887  instances executed at the same time. Bluetooth, File Transfer Protocol (FTP), and peer-to-peer 888  networking are examples of protocols that organizations consider eliminating, restricting, or 889  disabling. 890  REFERENCES 891  Source Controls: CM-7, CM-7(1), CM-7(2) 892  Supporting Publications: SP 800-160-1 [12], SP 800-167 [50] 893  3.4.7.

The authentication factors are defined as follows: something you know (e.g., a 1029  personal identification number [PIN]), something you have (e.g., a physical authenticator, such as 1030  a cryptographic private key), or something you are (e.g., a biometric). Multi-factor authentication 1031  solutions that feature physical authenticators include hardware authenticators that provide time-1032  based or challenge-response outputs and smart cards. In addition to authenticating users at the 1033  system level, organizations may also employ authentication mechanisms at the application level 1034  to provide increased information security. 1035  REFERENCES 1036  Source Controls: IA-2(1), IA-2(2) 1037  Supporting Publications: SP 800-63-3 [28] 1038  3.5.4.

Select a new password immediately upon account recovery. 1079  g. Allow the use of a temporary password for system logons with an immediate change to a 1080  permanent password. 1081  DISCUSSION 1082  Password-based authentication applies to passwords used in single-factor or multi-factor 1083  authentication. Long passwords or passphrases are preferable over shorter passwords. Enforced 1084  composition rules provide marginal security benefits while decreasing usability. However, 1085  organizations may choose to establish certain rules for password generation (e.g., minimum 1086  character length) under certain circumstances and can enforce this requirement. For example, 1087  account recovery can occur when a password is forgotten. Cryptographically protected passwords 1088  include salted one-way cryptographic hashes of passwords. The list of commonly used, 1089  compromised, or expected passwords includes passwords obtained from previous breach 1090  corpuses, dictionary words, and repetitive or sequential characters. The list includes context-1091  specific words, such as the name of the service, username, and derivatives thereof. Changing 1092  temporary passwords to permanent passwords immediately after system logon ensures that the 1093  necessary strength of the authentication mechanism is implemented at the earliest opportunity and 1094  reduces the susceptibility to authenticator compromises. 1095  REFERENCES 1096  Source Controls: IA-5(1) 1097  Supporting Publications: SP 800-63-3 [28] 1098  3.5.8.

Authentication Feedback 1102  Obscure feedback of authentication information. 1103  DISCUSSION 1104  The feedback from systems does not provide information that would allow unauthorized 1105  individuals to compromise authentication mechanisms. For example, for desktop or notebook 1106  computers with relatively large monitors, the threat may be significant (often referred to as 1107  shoulder surfing). For mobile devices with small displays, this threat may be less significant and 1108  is balanced against the increased likelihood of input errors due to small keyboards. Therefore, 1109  the means for obscuring the authenticator feedback is selected accordingly. Obscuring 1110  authenticator feedback includes displaying asterisks when users type passwords into input 1111  devices or displaying feedback for a limited time before fully obscuring it. 1112  REFERENCES 1113  Source Controls: IA-6 1114  Supporting Publications: None 1115  3.5.12.

The initial authenticator content is the actual content of the 1130  authenticator (e.g., the initial password). In contrast, requirements for authenticator content 1131  contain specific characteristics. Authenticator management is supported by organization-defined 1132  settings and restrictions for various authenticator characteristics (e.g., password complexity and 1133  composition rules, validation time window for time synchronous one-time tokens, and the 1134  number of allowed rejections during the verification stage of biometric authentication). 1135  The requirement to protect individual authenticators may be implemented by 3.15.3 for 1136  authenticators in the possession of individuals and by 3.1.1, 3.1.2, 3.1.5, and 3.13.8 for 1137  authenticators stored in organizational systems. This includes passwords stored in hashed or 1138  encrypted formats or files that contain encrypted or hashed passwords accessible with 1139  administrator privileges. Actions can be taken to safeguard authenticators, including 1140  maintaining possession of authenticators, not sharing authenticators with others, and 1141  immediately reporting lost, stolen, or compromised authenticators.

The tools may be pre-installed, brought in with maintenance personnel on media, 1243  cloud-based, or downloaded from a website. Diagnostic and test programs are potential vehicles 1244  for transporting malicious code into the system, either intentionally or unintentionally. Examples 1245  of media inspection include checking the cryptographic hash or digital signatures of diagnostic 1246  and test programs and/or media. If, upon inspection of media that contain maintenance diagnostic 1247  and test programs, organizations determine that the media contain malicious code, the incident is 1248  handled consistent with incident handling policies and procedures. A periodic review of system 1249  maintenance tools can result in the withdrawal of approval for outdated, unsupported, irrelevant, 1250  or no-longer-used tools. The hardware and software components that support maintenance and 1251  are considered a part of the system (including software implementing utilities such as “ping,” 1252  “ls,” “ipconfig,” or hardware and software that implement the monitoring port of an Ethernet 1253  switch) are not addressed by maintenance tools. 1254  REFERENCES 1255  Source Controls: MA-3, MA-3(1), MA-3(2), MA-3(3) 1256  Supporting Publications: SP 800-88 [54] 1257  https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/cprt/catalog#/cprt/framework/version/SP_800_53_5_1_0/home?element=IR-2 https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/cprt/catalog#/cprt/framework/version/SP_800_53_5_1_0/home?element=MA-3 https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/cprt/catalog#/cprt/framework/version/SP_800_53_5_1_0/home?element=MA-3 https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/cprt/catalog#/cprt/framework/version/SP_800_53_5_1_0/home?element=MA-3 https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/cprt/catalog#/cprt/framework/version/SP_800_53_5_1_0/home?element=MA-3  NIST SP 800-171r3 ipd (Initial Public Draft)  Protecting Controlled Unclassified Information  May 2023  34  3.7.5.

Media Sanitization 1319  Sanitize system media containing CUI prior to maintenance, disposal, release out of 1320  organizational control, or release for reuse. 1321  DISCUSSION 1322  Media sanitization applies to all digital and non-digital system media subject to disposal or reuse, 1323  whether or not the media is considered removable. Examples include digital media in scanners, 1324  copiers, printers, notebook computers, workstations, mobile devices, network components, and 1325  non-digital media. The sanitization process removes CUI from system media such that the 1326  information cannot be retrieved or reconstructed. Sanitization techniques (e.g., clearing, purging, 1327  cryptographically erasing, and destroying) prevent the disclosure of information to unauthorized 1328  individuals when such media is reused or released for disposal. Organizations determine the 1329  appropriate sanitization methods with the recognition that destruction is sometimes necessary 1330  https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/cprt/catalog#/cprt/framework/version/SP_800_53_5_1_0/home?element=MP-4 https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/cprt/catalog#/cprt/framework/version/SP_800_53_5_1_0/home?element=MP-2  NIST SP 800-171r3 ipd (Initial Public Draft)  Protecting Controlled Unclassified Information  May 2023  36  when other methods cannot be applied to media that require sanitization.

Implement cryptographic mechanisms to prevent the unauthorized disclosure of CUI stored 1354  on digital media during transport. 1355  DISCUSSION 1356  System media includes digital and non-digital media. Digital media includes flash drives, 1357  diskettes, magnetic tapes, external or removable solid state or magnetic drives, compact discs, 1358  and digital versatile discs. Non-digital media includes microfilm and paper. Controlled areas are 1359  spaces for which organizations provide physical or procedural controls to meet the requirements 1360  established for protecting information and systems. Controls to protect media during transport 1361  include cryptography and locked containers. Cryptographic mechanisms can provide 1362  confidentiality protections, depending on the mechanisms implemented. Activities associated 1363  with media transport include releasing media for transport, ensuring that media enters the 1364  appropriate transport processes, and the actual transport. Authorized transport and courier 1365  personnel may include individuals external to the organization. Maintaining accountability of 1366  system media during transport includes restricting transport activities to authorized personnel and 1367  tracking or obtaining records of transport activities as the media moves through the transportation 1368  system to prevent and detect loss, destruction, or tampering. 1369  https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/cprt/catalog#/cprt/framework/version/SP_800_53_5_1_0/home?element=MP-6 https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/cprt/catalog#/cprt/framework/version/SP_800_53_5_1_0/home?element=MP-3  NIST SP 800-171r3 ipd (Initial Public Draft)  Protecting Controlled Unclassified Information  May 2023  37  REFERENCES 1370  Source Controls: MP-5, SC-28, SC-28(1) 1371  Supporting Publications: SP 800-111 [55] 1372  3.8.6.

Prohibit the use of portable storage devices when such devices have no identifiable owner. 1377  DISCUSSION 1378  In contrast to requirement 3.8.1, which restricts user access to media, this requirement restricts 1379  the use of certain types of media on systems, such as restricting or prohibiting the use of flash 1380  drives or external hard drives. Organizations can employ technical and nontechnical controls 1381  (e.g., policies, procedures, and rules of behavior) to control the use of system media. For 1382  example, organizations may control the use of portable storage devices by using physical cages 1383  on workstations to prohibit access to external ports or disabling or removing the ability to insert, 1384  read, or write to devices. 1385  Organizations may limit the use of portable storage devices to only approved devices, including 1386  devices provided by the organization, devices provided by other approved organizations, and 1387  devices that are not personally owned. Finally, organizations may control the use of portable 1388  storage devices based on the type of device – prohibiting the use of writeable, portable devices –  1389  and implement this restriction by disabling or removing the capability to write to such devices. 1390  Requiring identifiable owners (e.g., individuals, organizations, or projects) for portable storage 1391  devices reduces the risk of using such technologies by allowing organizations to assign 1392  responsibility and accountability for addressing known vulnerabilities in the devices (e.g., 1393  insertion of malicious code). 1394  REFERENCES 1395  Source Controls: MP-7 1396  Supporting Publications: SP 800-111 [55] 1397  3.8.8.

Implement privileged access authorization to the system for vulnerability scanning activities. 1605  DISCUSSION 1606  Organizations determine the required vulnerability scanning for system components (including 1607  hardware, software, firmware, and applications) and ensure that potential sources of 1608  vulnerabilities (e.g., networked printers, scanners, and copiers) are not overlooked. The 1609  vulnerabilities to be scanned are readily updated as new vulnerabilities are discovered and 1610  announced and new scanning methods are developed. This process ensures that potential 1611  vulnerabilities in the system are identified and addressed as quickly as possible.  1612  Vulnerability analyses for custom software may require additional approaches, such as static 1613  analysis, dynamic analysis, binary analysis, or a hybrid of the three approaches. Organizations 1614  can employ these analysis approaches in source code reviews and in a variety of tools (e.g., 1615  static analysis tools, web-based application scanners, binary analyzers). Vulnerability scanning 1616  includes scanning for patch levels; scanning for functions, ports, protocols, and services that 1617  should not be accessible to users or devices; and scanning for improperly configured or 1618  incorrectly operating information flow control mechanisms. 1619  To facilitate interoperability, organizations consider using products that are Security Content 1620  Automated Protocol (SCAP)-validated, as well as scanning tools that express vulnerabilities in 1621  the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) naming convention and that employ the 1622  Open Vulnerability Assessment Language (OVAL) to determine the presence of system 1623  vulnerabilities. Sources for vulnerability information include the Common Weakness 1624  Enumeration (CWE) listing and the National Vulnerability Database (NVD). 1625  Security assessments, such as red team exercises, provide additional sources of potential 1626  vulnerabilities for which to scan. Organizations also consider using scanning tools that express 1627  vulnerability impact by the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS). In certain 1628  situations, the nature of the vulnerability scanning may be more intrusive, or the system 1629  component that is the subject of the scanning may contain highly sensitive information. 1630  Privileged access authorization to selected system components facilitates thorough vulnerability 1631  scanning and protects the sensitive nature of such scanning. 1632  REFERENCES 1633  Source Controls: RA-5, RA-5(2), RA-5(5) 1634  Supporting Publications: SP 800-40 [60], SP 800-53A [61], SP 800-70 [48], SP 800-115 [62], 1635  SP 800-126 [49] 1636  3.11.3.

Risk Response  1638  Respond to findings from security assessments, monitoring, and audits. 1639  DISCUSSION 1640  Organizations have many options for responding to risk, including mitigating risk by 1641  implementing new controls or strengthening existing controls, accepting risk with appropriate 1642  justification or rationale, sharing or transferring risk, or avoiding risk. The organizational risk 1643  management strategy and risk tolerance influence risk response decisions and actions. This 1644  requirement addresses the need to determine an appropriate response to risk before generating a 1645  plan of action and milestones entry. For example, the response may be to accept risk or reject 1646  risk, or it may be possible to mitigate the risk immediately so that a plan of action and 1647  milestones entry is not needed. However, if the risk response is to mitigate the risk, and the 1648  mitigation cannot be completed immediately, a plan of action and milestones entry is generated.  1649  REFERENCES 1650  Source Controls: RA-7 1651  Supporting Publications: SP 800-30 [59], SP 800-37 [63], SP 800-39 [64], SP 800-160-1 [12] 1652  Security Assessment and Monitoring 1653  3.12.1. Control Assessments 1654  Assess the controls in the system and its environment of operation [Assignment: organization-1655  defined frequency] to determine the extent to which the controls are implemented correctly, 1656  operating as intended, and producing the desired outcome with respect to meeting specified 1657  security requirements. 1658  DISCUSSION 1659  Organizations assess security controls in the system and the environment in which that system 1660  operates as part of the system development life cycle. Security controls are the safeguards that 1661  organizations implement to satisfy security requirements. By assessing implemented security 1662  controls, organizations determine whether the necessary safeguards are in place and operating 1663  as intended. Security control assessments identify weaknesses and deficiencies early in the 1664  system life cycle, provide essential information needed to make risk-based decisions, and ensure 1665  compliance to vulnerability mitigation procedures. Assessments are conducted on the 1666  implemented controls as documented in system security plans. 1667  Security assessment reports document assessment results in sufficient detail as deemed 1668  necessary by organizations to determine the accuracy and completeness of the reports and 1669  whether the security controls are implemented correctly, operating as intended, and producing 1670  the desired outcome with respect to meeting security requirements. Security assessment results 1671  are provided to the individuals or roles appropriate for the types of assessments being 1672  conducted. 1673  Organizations ensure that assessment results are current, relevant to the determination of control 1674  effectiveness, and obtained with the appropriate level of assessor independence. Organizations 1675  can choose to use other types of assessment activities, such as vulnerability scanning and 1676  system monitoring, to maintain the security posture of the system during the system life cycle. 1677  https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/cprt/catalog#/cprt/framework/version/SP_800_53_5_1_0/home?element=RA-7  NIST SP 800-171r3 ipd (Initial Public Draft)  Protecting Controlled Unclassified Information  May 2023  45  REFERENCES 1678  Source Controls: CA-2 1679  Supporting Publications: SP 800-53 [8], SP 800-53A [61], SP 800-37 [63], SP 800-115 [62] 1680  3.12.2.

Organizations use POAMs to describe how unimplemented security requirements 1691  and security controls will be met and how planned mitigations will be implemented. 1692  Organizations can document system security plans and POAMs as separate or combined 1693  documents and in any chosen format. Federal agencies may consider system security plans and 1694  POAMs as inputs to risk-based decisions on whether to process, store, or transmit CUI on a 1695  system hosted by a nonfederal organization. 1696  REFERENCES 1697  Source Controls: CA-5 1698  Supporting Publications: SP 800-37 [63] 1699  3.12.3. Continuous Monitoring 1700  Develop and implement a system-level continuous monitoring strategy that includes ongoing 1701  monitoring and assessment of control effectiveness. 1702  DISCUSSION 1703  Continuous monitoring at the system level facilitates ongoing awareness of the system security 1704  posture to support organizational risk management decisions. The terms continuous and 1705  ongoing imply that organizations assess and monitor their controls and risks at a frequency 1706  sufficient to support risk-based decisions. Different types of controls may require different 1707  monitoring frequencies. When monitoring the effectiveness of multiple controls that have been 1708  grouped into capabilities, a root cause analysis may be needed to determine the specific control 1709  that has failed. 1710  REFERENCES 1711  Source Controls: CA-7 1712  Supporting Publications: SP 800-37 [63], SP 800-39 [64], SP 800-53A [61], SP 800-115 [62], 1713  SP 800-137 [53] 1714  3.12.4.

Independent Assessment 1716  Use independent assessors or assessment teams to assess controls. 1717  DISCUSSION 1718  Independent assessors or assessment teams are individuals or groups who conduct impartial 1719  security assessments of the system. Impartiality means that assessors are free from perceived or 1720  actual conflicts of interest regarding the development, operation, sustainment, or management 1721  of the system under assessment or the determination of control effectiveness. To achieve 1722  impartiality, assessors do not create a mutual or conflicting interest with the organizations 1723  where the assessments are being conducted, assess their own work, act as management or 1724  employees of the organizations they are serving, or place themselves in positions of advocacy 1725  for the organizations that acquire their services. 1726  REFERENCES 1727  Source Controls: CA-2(1) 1728  Supporting Publications: SP 800-37 [63], SP 800-53A [61], SP 800-115 [62], SP 800-137 [53] 1729  3.12.6.

Types of agreements can include interconnection security agreements, information 1739  exchange security agreements, memoranda of understanding or agreement, service-level 1740  agreements, or other types of agreements. Organizations may incorporate agreement 1741  information into formal contracts, especially for information exchanges established between 1742  federal agencies and nonfederal organizations (e.g., service providers, contractors, system 1743  developers, and system integrators). Examples of the types of information contained in 1744  exchange agreements include the interface characteristics, security requirements, controls, and 1745  responsibilities for each system. 1746  REFERENCES 1747  Source Controls: CA-3 1748  Supporting Publications: SP 800-47 [87] 1749  3.12.7.

Intra-system connections include 1758  connections with mobile devices, notebook and desktop computers, tablets, printers, copiers, 1759  facsimile machines, scanners, sensors, and servers. Instead of authorizing each internal system 1760  connection, organizations can authorize internal connections for a class of system components 1761  with common characteristics and/or configurations, including printers, scanners, and copiers 1762  with a specified processing, transmission, and storage capability or smart phones and tablets 1763  with a specific baseline configuration. 1764  REFERENCES 1765  Source Controls: CA-9 1766  Supporting Publications: SP 800-124 [29] 1767  System and Communications Protection 1768  3.13.1.

Connect to external networks or systems only through managed interfaces consisting of 1774  boundary protection devices arranged in accordance with an organizational security 1775  architecture. 1776  DISCUSSION 1777  Managed interfaces include gateways, routers, firewalls, guards, network-based malicious code 1778  analysis, virtualization systems, or encrypted tunnels implemented within a security 1779  architecture. Subnetworks that are either physically or logically separated from internal 1780  networks are referred to as demilitarized zones or DMZs. Restricting or prohibiting interfaces 1781  within organizational systems includes restricting external web traffic to designated web servers 1782  within managed interfaces, prohibiting external traffic that appears to be spoofing internal 1783  addresses, and prohibiting internal traffic that appears to be spoofing external addresses. 1784  Boundary protection may be implemented as a common control for all or part of an 1785  organizational network such that the boundary to be protected is greater than a system-specific 1786  boundary (i.e., an authorization boundary). 1787  Organizations consider the shared nature of commercial telecommunications services in the 1788  implementation of security requirements associated with the use of such services. Commercial 1789  telecommunications services are commonly based on network components and consolidated 1790  management systems shared by all attached commercial customers and may also include third 1791  party-provided access lines and other service elements. Such transmission services may 1792  represent sources of increased risk despite contract security provisions. 1793  REFERENCES 1794  Source Controls: SC-7 1795  https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/cprt/catalog#/cprt/framework/version/SP_800_53_5_1_0/home?element=CA-9 https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/cprt/catalog#/cprt/framework/version/SP_800_53_5_1_0/home?element=SC-7  NIST SP 800-171r3 ipd (Initial Public Draft)  Protecting Controlled Unclassified Information  May 2023  48  Supporting Publications: SP 800-41 [68], SP 800-125B [69], SP 800-160-1 [12], SP 800-189 1796  [71], SP 800-207 [70] 1797  3.13.2.

The 1803  separation of user functionality from system management functionality is physical or logical. 1804  Organizations can implement the separation of system management functionality from user 1805  functionality by using different computers, different central processing units, different instances 1806  of operating systems, different network addresses, virtualization techniques, or combinations of 1807  these or other methods, as appropriate. This type of separation includes web administrative 1808  interfaces that use separate authentication methods for users of any other system resources.

Information in Shared System Resources 1815  Prevent unauthorized and unintended information transfer via shared system resources. 1816  DISCUSSION 1817  Preventing unauthorized and unintended information transfer via shared system resources stops 1818  information produced by the actions of prior users or roles (or actions of processes acting on 1819  behalf of prior users or roles) from being available to current users or roles (or current processes 1820  acting on behalf of current users or roles) that obtain access to shared system resources after 1821  those resources have been released back to the system. Information in shared system resources 1822  also applies to encrypted representations of information. In other contexts, the control of 1823  information in shared system resources is referred to as object reuse and residual information 1824  protection. Information in shared system resources does not address information remanence, 1825  which refers to the residual representation of data that has been nominally deleted, covert 1826  channels (including storage and timing channels) in which shared system resources are 1827  manipulated to violate information flow restrictions, or components within systems for which 1828  there are only single users or roles. 1829  REFERENCES 1830  Source Controls: SC-4 1831  Supporting Publications: None 1832  3.13.5.

Split Tunneling 1845  Prevent split tunneling for remote devices unless the split tunnel is securely provisioned using 1846  [Assignment: organization-defined safeguards]. 1847  DISCUSSION 1848  Split tunneling is the process of allowing a remote user or device to establish a non-remote 1849  connection with a system and simultaneously communicate with a resource in an external 1850  network via some other connection. This method of network access enables a user to access 1851  remote devices and simultaneously access uncontrolled networks. Split tunneling may be 1852  desirable by remote users to communicate with system resources, such as printers or file 1853  servers. However, split tunneling can facilitate unauthorized external connections and make the 1854  system vulnerable to attack and the exfiltration of CUI. 1855  Split tunneling can be prevented by disabling configuration settings that allow such capabilities 1856  in remote devices and by preventing those configuration settings from being configurable by 1857  users. Prevention can also be achieved through the detection of split tunneling (or of 1858  configuration settings that allow split tunneling) in the remote device and by prohibiting the 1859  connection if the remote device is using split tunneling. A virtual private network (VPN) can be 1860  used to securely provision a split tunnel. A securely provisioned VPN includes locking 1861  connectivity to exclusive, managed, and named environments or to a specific set of pre-1862  approved addresses without user control. 1863  REFERENCES 1864  Source Controls: SC-7(7) 1865  Supporting Publications: SP 800-41 [68], SP 800-77 [19], SP 800-189 [71] 1866  3.13.8.

Session Authenticity 1959  Protect the authenticity of communications sessions. 1960  DISCUSSION 1961  Protecting session authenticity addresses communications protection at the session level, not 1962  at the packet level. Such protection establishes grounds for confidence at both ends of the 1963  communications sessions in the ongoing identities of other parties and validity of transmitted 1964  information. Authenticity protection includes protecting against “adversary-in-the-middle” 1965  attacks (also known as “man-in-the middle” attacks), session hijacking, and the insertion of 1966  false information into sessions. 1967  REFERENCES 1968  Source Controls: SC-23 1969  Supporting Publications: SP 800-52 [73], SP 800-77 [19], SP 800-95 [76], SP 800-113 [20] 1970  3.13.16.

Internal Network Communications Traffic 1972  Route internal network communications traffic to external networks through an authenticated 1973  proxy server. 1974  DISCUSSION 1975  External networks are networks outside of organizational control. A proxy server is a server 1976  (i.e., system or application) that acts as an intermediary for clients who request system 1977  resources from non-organizational or other organizational servers. System resources that may 1978  be requested include files, connections, web pages, or services. Client requests established 1979  through a connection to a proxy server are assessed to manage complexity and provide 1980  additional protection by limiting direct connectivity. Web content filtering devices are one of 1981  the most common proxy servers that provide access to the internet. Proxy servers can support 1982  the logging of Transmission Control Protocol sessions and the blocking of specific Uniform 1983  Resource Locators, Internet Protocol addresses, and domain names. Web proxies can be 1984  configured with organization-defined lists of authorized and unauthorized websites.

System Access Points 1993  Limit the number of external network connections to the system. 1994  DISCUSSION 1995  Limiting the number of external network connections facilitates the monitoring of inbound 1996  and outbound communications traffic and is important during transition periods from older to 1997  newer technologies. Such transitions may require implementing older and newer technologies 1998  simultaneously during the transition period and thus increase the number of access points to 1999  the system. 2000  REFERENCES 2001  Source Controls: SC-7(3) 2002  Supporting Publications: SP 800-41 [68], SP 800-125B [69], SP 800-207 [70], SP 800-160-1 2003  [12] 2004  System and Information Integrity 2005  3.14.1.

Security-relevant updates 2015  include patches, service packs, hot fixes, and anti-virus signatures. Organizations address the 2016  flaws discovered during security assessments, continuous monitoring, incident response 2017  activities, and system error handling. Organizations can take advantage of available resources, 2018  such as the Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) or Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures 2019  (CVE) databases, in remediating the flaws discovered in organizational systems. Organization-2020  defined time periods for updating security-relevant software and firmware may vary based on a 2021  variety of factors, including the criticality of the update (i.e., severity of the vulnerability related 2022  to the discovered flaw).

Malicious Code Protection 2028  a. Implement malicious code protection mechanisms at designated locations within the system 2029  to detect and eradicate malicious code. 2030  b. Update malicious code protection mechanisms as new releases are available in accordance 2031  with organizational configuration management policy and procedures. 2032  DISCUSSION 2033  Malicious code insertions occur through the exploitation of system vulnerabilities. Periodic 2034  scans of the system and real-time scans of files from external sources as files are downloaded, 2035  opened, or executed can detect malicious code. Malicious code can be inserted into the system 2036  in a variety of ways, including by electronic mail, the world wide web, and portable storage 2037  devices. Malicious code includes viruses, worms, Trojan horses, and spyware. Malicious code 2038  can be encoded in various formats, contained in compressed or hidden files, or hidden in files 2039  using techniques such as steganography. In addition to the above technologies, pervasive 2040  configuration management, comprehensive software integrity controls, and anti-exploitation 2041  software may be effective in preventing the execution of unauthorized code. Malicious code 2042  may be present in commercial off-the-shelf software as well as custom-built software and could 2043  include logic bombs, backdoors, and other types of attacks that could affect organizational 2044  mission and business functions. 2045  In situations where malicious code cannot be detected by detection methods or technologies, 2046  organizations rely on other types of controls – including secure coding practices, configuration 2047  management and control, trusted procurement processes, and monitoring practices – to ensure 2048  that software does not perform functions other than the functions intended. Organizations may 2049  determine that different actions are warranted in response to the detection of malicious code. 2050  For example, organizations can define actions in response to malicious code detection during 2051  scans, the detection of malicious downloads, or the detection of maliciousness when attempting 2052  to open or execute files. 2053  REFERENCES 2054  Source Controls: SI-3 2055  Supporting Publications: SP 800-83 [80], SP 800-125B [69], SP 800-177 [74] 2056  3.14.3. Security Alerts, Advisories, and Directives 2057  a. Receive security alerts, advisories, and directives from external organizations. 2058  b. Generate internal security alerts, advisories, and directives, as necessary. 2059  DISCUSSION 2060  There are many publicly available sources of system security alerts and advisories. For 2061  example, the Department of Homeland Security’s Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security 2062  Agency (CISA) generates security alerts and advisories to maintain situational awareness across 2063  the Federal Government and in nonfederal organizations. Software vendors, subscription 2064  services, and industry Information Sharing and Analysis Centers (ISACs) may also provide 2065  https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/cprt/catalog#/cprt/framework/version/SP_800_53_5_1_0/home?element=SI-2 https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/cprt/catalog#/cprt/framework/version/SP_800_53_5_1_0/home?element=SI-3  NIST SP 800-171r3 ipd (Initial Public Draft)  Protecting Controlled Unclassified Information  May 2023  55  security alerts and advisories. Compliance with security directives is essential due to the critical 2066  nature of many of these directives and the potential immediate adverse effects on organizational 2067  operations and assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation should the directives not 2068  be implemented in a timely manner. Examples of response actions include notifying relevant 2069  external organizations, such as external mission and business partners, supply chain partners, 2070  service providers, and peer or supporting organizations. 2071  REFERENCES 2072  Source Controls: SI-5 2073  Supporting Publications: SP 800-161 [37] 2074  3.14.4.

Monitor the system, including inbound and outbound communications traffic, to detect: 2078  1. Attacks and indicators of potential attacks; 2079  2. Unusual or unauthorized activities or conditions; and 2080  3. Unauthorized connections. 2081  b. Identify unauthorized use of the system. 2082  DISCUSSION 2083  System monitoring involves external and internal monitoring. External monitoring includes the 2084  observation of events that occur at the system boundary, while internal monitoring includes the 2085  observation of events that occur within the system. Organizations can monitor the system, for 2086  example, by observing audit record activities in real time or by observing other system aspects, 2087  such as access patterns, characteristics of access, and other actions. The monitoring objectives 2088  may guide determination of the events. 2089  A system monitoring capability is achieved through a variety of tools and techniques (e.g., audit 2090  record monitoring software, intrusion detection systems, intrusion prevention systems, 2091  malicious code protection software, scanning tools, network monitoring software). Strategic 2092  locations for monitoring devices include selected perimeter locations and near server farms that 2093  support critical applications with such devices being employed at managed system interfaces. 2094  The granularity of monitoring the information collected is based on organizational monitoring 2095  objectives and the capability of the system to support such objectives. 2096  System monitoring is an integral part of continuous monitoring and incident response programs. 2097  The output from system monitoring serves as input to continuous monitoring and incident 2098  response programs. A network connection is any connection with a device that communicates 2099  through a network (e.g., local area network, internet). A remote connection is any connection 2100  with a device that communicates through an external network (e.g., the internet). Local, 2101  network, and remote connections can be either wired or wireless. 2102  Unusual or unauthorized activities or conditions related to inbound and outbound 2103  communications traffic include internal traffic that indicates the presence of malicious code in 2104  the system or propagating among system components, the unauthorized export of information, 2105  https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/cprt/catalog#/cprt/framework/version/SP_800_53_5_1_0/home?element=SI-5  NIST SP 800-171r3 ipd (Initial Public Draft)  Protecting Controlled Unclassified Information  May 2023  56  or signaling to external systems.

System Security Plan 2143  a. Develop and document a system security plan that describes: 2144  1. System boundary and operating environment; 2145  2. Security requirements, tailoring actions, and implementation; and 2146  3. Connections to other systems. 2147  b. Review and update the plan at [Assignment: organization-defined frequency]. 2148  DISCUSSION 2149  System security plans relate security requirements to a set of security controls. System security 2150  plans also provide a high-level description of how the controls meet those requirements but do 2151  not provide detailed descriptions of the design or implementation of the controls. System 2152  security plans contain sufficient information to enable a design and implementation that is 2153  unambiguously compliant with the intent of the plans and the subsequent determinations of risk 2154  if the plan is implemented as intended. System security plans can be a collection of documents, 2155  including documents that already exist. Effective system security plans make use of references 2156  to policies, procedures, and additional documents (e.g., design specifications) where detailed 2157  information can be obtained. This reduces the documentation requirements associated with 2158  security programs and maintains security information in other established management or 2159  operational areas related to enterprise architecture, the system development life cycle, systems 2160  engineering, and acquisition. 2161  REFERENCES 2162  Source Controls: PL-2 2163  Supporting Publications: SP 800-18 [67] 2164  3.15.3.

For legacy systems, organizations apply systems security 2182  engineering principles to system upgrades and modifications to the extent feasible, given the 2183  current state of hardware, software, and firmware components within those systems. The 2184  application of systems security engineering concepts and principles helps to develop 2185  trustworthy, secure, and resilient systems and reduce the susceptibility of organizations to 2186  disruptions, hazards, and threats. Examples include developing layered protections; establishing 2187  security policies, architecture, and controls as the foundation for design; incorporating security 2188  requirements into the system development life cycle; delineating physical and logical security 2189  boundaries; ensuring that developers are trained on how to build trustworthy secure software; 2190  and performing threat modeling to identify use cases, threat agents, attack vectors and patterns, 2191  design patterns, and compensating controls needed to mitigate risk. Organizations that apply 2192  security engineering concepts and principles can facilitate the development of trustworthy, 2193  secure systems, system components, and system services; reduce risk to acceptable levels; and 2194  make informed risk-management decisions. 2195  REFERENCES 2196  Source Controls: SA-8 2197  Supporting Publications: SP 800-160-1 [12], SP 800-160-2 [11], SP 800-207 [70] 2198  3.16.2. Unsupported System Components 2199  a. Replace system components when support for the components is no longer available from 2200  the developer, vendor, or manufacturer; or 2201  b. Provide options for alternative sources for continued support for unsupported components. 2202  DISCUSSION 2203  Support for system components includes software patches, firmware updates, replacement parts, 2204  and maintenance contracts. An example of unsupported components includes when vendors no 2205  longer provide critical software patches or product updates, which can result in an opportunity 2206  for adversaries to exploit weaknesses in the installed components. Exceptions to replacing 2207  unsupported system components include systems that provide critical mission or business 2208  capabilities where newer technologies are not available or where the systems are so isolated that 2209  installing replacement components is not an option. 2210  Alternative sources for support address the need to provide continued support for system 2211  components that are no longer supported by the original manufacturers, developers, or vendors 2212  when such components remain essential to organizational mission and business functions. If 2213  necessary, organizations can establish in-house support by developing customized patches for 2214  critical software components or, alternatively, obtain the services of external providers who 2215  provide ongoing support for the designated unsupported components through contractual 2216  relationships. Such contractual relationships can include open-source software value-added 2217  vendors. The increased risk of using unsupported system components can be mitigated, for 2218  example, by prohibiting the connection of such components to public or uncontrolled networks 2219  or implementing other forms of isolation.  2220  REFERENCES 2221  Source Controls: SA-22 2222  Supporting Publications: None 2223  https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/cprt/catalog#/cprt/framework/version/SP_800_53_5_1_0/home?element=SA-8 https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/cprt/catalog#/cprt/framework/version/SP_800_53_5_1_0/home?element=SA-22  NIST SP 800-171r3 ipd (Initial Public Draft)  Protecting Controlled Unclassified Information  May 2023  59  3.16.3.

Implement the following processes, methods, and techniques to monitor control compliance 2230  by external service providers on an ongoing basis: [Assignment: organization-defined 2231  processes, methods, and techniques]. 2232  DISCUSSION 2233  External system services are provided by an external provider, and in most cases, the 2234  organization has no direct control over the implementation of the required controls or the 2235  assessment of control effectiveness. Organizations establish relationships with external service 2236  providers in a variety of ways, including through business partnerships, contracts, interagency 2237  agreements, lines of business arrangements, licensing agreements, joint ventures, and supply 2238  chain exchanges. The responsibility for managing risks from the use of external system services 2239  remains with the organization charged with protecting CUI. Service-level agreements define the 2240  expectations of performance for the implemented controls, describe measurable outcomes, and 2241  identify remedies, mitigations, and response requirements for identified instances of 2242  noncompliance. Information from external service providers regarding the specific functions, 2243  ports, protocols, and services used in the provision of such services can be useful when the need 2244  arises to understand the trade-offs involved in restricting certain functions and services or 2245  blocking certain ports and protocols. 2246  REFERENCES 2247  Source Controls: SA-9 2248  Supporting Publications: SP 800-160-1 [12], SP 800-161 [37] 2249  Supply Chain Risk Management 2250  3.17.1.

Managing supply chain risk is a complex, 2262  multifaceted undertaking that requires a coordinated effort across an organization to build trust 2263  relationships and communicate with internal and external stakeholders. 2264  https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/cprt/catalog#/cprt/framework/version/SP_800_53_5_1_0/home?element=SA-9  NIST SP 800-171r3 ipd (Initial Public Draft)  Protecting Controlled Unclassified Information  May 2023  60  Supply chain risk management (SCRM) activities include identifying and assessing risks, 2265  determining appropriate risk response actions, developing SCRM plans to document response 2266  actions, and monitoring performance against plans. The system-level SCRM plan is 2267  implementation-specific and provides policy implementation, requirements, constraints and 2268  implications. It can either be stand-alone or incorporated into system security plans. The SCRM 2269  plan addresses the management, implementation, and monitoring of SCRM controls and the 2270  development or sustainment of systems across the SDLC to support mission and business 2271  functions. Because supply chains can differ significantly across and within organizations, SCRM 2272  plans are tailored to individual program, organizational, and operational contexts.  2273  REFERENCES 2274  Source Controls: SR-2 2275  Supporting Publications: SP 800-30 [59], SP 800-39 [64], SP 800-160-1 [12], SP 800-181 [38] 2276  3.17.2. Acquisition Strategies, Tools, and Methods 2277  Develop and implement acquisition strategies, contract tools, and procurement methods to 2278  protect against, identify, and mitigate supply chain risks. 2279  DISCUSSION 2280  The acquisition process provides an important vehicle for protecting the supply chain. There are 2281  many useful tools and techniques available, including obscuring the end use of a system or 2282  system component, using blind or filtered buys, requiring tamper-evident packaging, or using 2283  trusted or controlled distribution. The results from a supply chain risk assessment can inform 2284  the strategies, tools, and methods that are most applicable to the situation. Tools and techniques 2285  may provide protections against unauthorized production, theft, tampering, the insertion of 2286  counterfeits, the insertion of malicious software or backdoors, and poor development practices 2287  throughout the system life cycle. 2288  Organizations also consider providing incentives for suppliers to implement controls, promote 2289  transparency in their processes and security practices, provide contract language that addresses 2290  the prohibition of tainted or counterfeit components, and restrict purchases from untrustworthy 2291  suppliers. Organizations consider providing training, education, and awareness programs for 2292  personnel regarding supply chain risk, available mitigation strategies, and when the programs 2293  should be employed. Methods for reviewing and protecting development plans, documentation, 2294  and evidence are commensurate with the security requirements of the organization. Contracts 2295  may specify documentation protection requirements. 2296  REFERENCES 2297  Source Controls: SR-5 2298  Supporting Publications: SP 800-30 [59], SP 800-161 [37] 2299  3.17.3.

Supply chain processes 2309  include hardware, software, and firmware development processes; shipping and handling 2310  procedures; personnel security and physical security programs; configuration management 2311  tools, techniques, and measures to maintain provenance; or other programs, processes, or 2312  procedures associated with the development, acquisition, maintenance and disposal of systems 2313  and system components. Supply chain elements and processes may be provided by 2314  organizations, system integrators, or external providers. Weaknesses or deficiencies in supply 2315  chain elements or processes represent potential vulnerabilities that can be exploited by 2316  adversaries to harm the organization and affect its ability to carry out its core missions or 2317  business functions. 2318  REFERENCES 2319  Source Controls: SR-3 2320  Supporting Publications: SP 800-30 [59], SP 800-161 [37] 2321  3.17.4. Component Disposal 2322  Dispose of system components, documentation, or tools containing CUI using the following 2323  techniques and methods: [Assignment: organization-defined techniques and methods]. 2324  DISCUSSION 2325  Data, documentation, tools, or system components can be disposed of at any time during the 2326  system development life cycle (not only in the disposal or retirement phase of the life cycle). 2327  For example, disposal can occur during research and development, design, prototyping, 2328  operations, or maintenance and include methods such as disk cleaning, the removal of 2329  cryptographic keys, the partial reuse of components. Opportunities for compromise during 2330  disposal affect physical and logical data, including system documentation in paper-based or 2331  digital files, shipping and delivery documentation, memory sticks with software code, or 2332  complete routers or servers that include permanent media that contain sensitive or proprietary 2333  information. Additionally, the proper disposal of system components helps to prevent such 2334  components from entering the gray market. 2335  REFERENCES 2336  Source Controls: SR-12 2337  Supporting Publications: SP 800-30 [59], SP 800-161 [37]  2338  https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/cprt/catalog#/cprt/framework/version/SP_800_53_5_1_0/home?element=SR-3 https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/cprt/catalog#/cprt/framework/version/SP_800_53_5_1_0/home?element=SR-12  NIST SP 800-171r3 ipd (Initial Public Draft)  Protecting Controlled Unclassified Information  May 2023  62  References 2339  [1] Executive Order 13556 (2010) Controlled Unclassified Information.

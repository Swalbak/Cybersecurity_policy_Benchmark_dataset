Among the dynamic developments and changes that happened, there is one thing  that has remaained stable: the race between defenders and adversaries has continued and will  continue in the future.  Over 250 reports and sources have been analysed for this year’s report. From a threat landscape  perspective, 2013 has brought good and bad developments. Let’s start with the bad:   Threat agents have increased sophistication of their attacks and their tools.   It has become clear that maturity in cyber activities is not a matter of a handful of nation states.  Rather, multiple nation states have now developed capabilities that can be used to infiltrate all  kinds of targets both governmental and private ones in order to achieve their objectives.   Cyber-threats go mobile: attack patterns and tools that targeted PCs a few years ago, have been  migrated to the mobile ecosystem.   Two new digital battlefields have emerged: big data and the Internet of Things.  But 2013 has also brought us important good developments. Positive developments observed in  2013 in the area of cyber-threats include:   Impressive successes by law-enforcement have been achieved. The police has arrested a gang  responsible for the Police Virus. The Silk Road operator has been arrested and the platform has  been shut down. The developer and operator of Blackhole, the most popular exploit kit, has  been arrested.   The number of reports and data regarding cyber-threats has increased and so has the quality of  available information. This has facilitated threat analysis.   Vendors have increased the speed in which they respond to threats and vulnerabilities via  updates of their products.   Cooperation among relevant organisations to commonly assess and defend cyber-threats has  been envisaged and is going to gain speed in the near future.   Issues related to industrial espionage and state sponsored surveillance became a major  discussion topic during this reporting period. The ENISA Threat Report takes account of these  issues to the extent that these activities are related to assessed cyber-threats. It should be noted  however that, apart from providing guidelines on how to protect systems against the technical  threats enumerated, any additional response to industrial espionage and state sponsored  surveillance is not in ENISA's mandate.   The present document targets security professionals, decision makers, media and all other  interested individuals interested in obtaining information on threats and threat trends for  emerging technology areas.  Hopefully, lessons learned and conclusions drawn will help streamlining activities in the stakeholder  community. ENISA will capitalize on this knowledge and will inject it into the activities of  forthcoming ENISA Work Programmes:   Actively involve end-users in defence of cyber-threats;   Increase cyber-threat intelligence by creating and disseminating appropriate knowledge and by  coordinating activities of relevant organisations;   Increase the speed of threat assessment to reduce exposure;   Invest in research to enhance appropriateness of security policies and security controls.

The  rankings of emerging threat trends can be found in the corresponding section (see chapter 5). Arrows that show a  stability in a threat may be increasing in emerging areas. This is because current threat landscape includes all threats  independently from particular areas.

The ENISA Threat Landscape is a  reporton significant cyber-threats that have been assessed in the reporting period, i.e. within 2013.  Moreover, the ENISA Threat Landscape delivers predictions for threat trends regarding emerging  technology areas. The work on the ENISA Threat Landscape has been performed as part of the ENISA  Work Programme 2013 under the Work Stream “Evolving risk environment & opportunities”.  The objective of this work is to provide stakeholders with information about developments in the  cyber-threat landscape and to identify threat trends for the near future, ie in the coming year. For  the prediction of trends, important areas of IT innovation and development were taken as a basis.  The assessed top threats from 2013 are mapped to these areas and thus an emerging threat  landscape is created.  ETL 2013 is based on a comprehensive information collection of publicly available open source  material. Reports of various kinds (i.e. content, context, level of detail, subject areas, etc.) are  collected over the entire reporting period. These reports are parsed to identify relevant content,  such as threats, threat agents and trends. The collected information is collated and consolidated. In  2013, a large number of such reports have been collected (over 250). They span the period  beginning end 2012 up to the publication date of this report, ca. end of November 2013. Reports  appearing after this period will be considered in the next year’s ETL, to be delivered around the  same period in 2014.  In a similar fashion as in last year’s report, ETL 2013 includes:   A Current Threat Landscape consisting of contemporary developments of cyber-threats as  they have been reported by national and international stakeholders such as CERTS/CSIRTs,  industry, governmental organisations, networks of excellence, academia, press and  individual security experts;   An Emerging Threat Landscape consisting of threat trends identified for a number of  areas/sectors with high levels of innovation and market potential and,   Identification of Threat Agents being the main source of assessed cyber-threats.  Issues related to industrial espionage and state sponsored surveillance became a major discussion  topic during this reporting period. The ENISA Threat Report takes account of these issues to the  extent that these activities are related to assessed cyber-threats. It should be noted however that,  apart from providing guidelines on how to protect systems against the technical threats  enumerated, any additional response to industrial espionage and state sponsored surveillance is not  in ENISA's mandate.  In this year’s ETL, we have introduced the concept of “attack workflow”, indicating how assessed  threats are being deployed by threat agents within an attack. This information is considered as  important because it delivers information on how threats, the malicious tools of adversaries, are  being used in order to set up a successful attack.  Lessons learned and conclusions are indicating future actions for the cyber-security community in  order to achieve good progress in the subject of threat analysis and trend identification. In  forthcoming ENISA activities, these issues will be taken into account as a contribution in improving  cyber-security capabilities of all involved stakeholders.  ENISA Threat Landscape 2013  Overview of current and emerging cyber-threats  11 December 2013  Page  2  Policy Context  The Cyber Security Strategy of the EU2 stresses the importance of threat analysis and emerging  trends in cyber security. The ENISA Threat Landscape is an activity contributing towards the  achievement of objectives formulated in this regulation, in particular by contributing to the  identification of emerging trends in cyber-threats and understanding the evolution of cyber-crime  (see 2.4 regarding proposed role of ENISA).  Moreover, the new ENISA regulation3 mentions the necessity to analyse current and emerging risks  (and their components), stating: “the Agency, in cooperation with Member States and, as  appropriate, with statistical bodies and others, collects relevant information”. In particular, under  Art. 3, Tasks, d), iii), the new ENISA regulations states that ENISA should “enable effective responses  to current and emerging network and information security risks and threats”.  The ENISA Threat Landscape aims to make  a significant contribution to the EU Cyber Security  Strategy by streamlining and consolidating available information on cyber-threats and their  evolution.  Target audience  The target groups of this document are all specialists/individuals who are concerned with the  development/evolution of threats in cyber space: primarily security experts interested in assessing  the “external environment” and “Internal environments”4 in the framework of threat and risk  assessments. This information might be interesting when formulating security policies or creating  protection profiles. Finally, interested decision makers and users of IT components may find  information in order to make informed decisions towards investment for the protection of  potentially valuable assets or to define their risk appetite.  ETL 2013 will be of interest for policy makers: current threats and threat trends may be important  input in policy actions in the area of cyber-security, national cyber-security preparedness and  possible coordination and cooperation initiatives.  Through the large number of collected reports, ETL 2013 provides a unique collection of information  regarding cyber-security threats. Hence, a further target group of this document consists of  individuals who would like to obtain access to these sources in order to use them for their own  purposes.  Last but not least, and as experience with ETL 2012 has shown, the threat landscape is an important  piece of information for media as it provides to non-security experts information to understand  dependencies and developments in the area of cyber-security. Moreover, it serves as a continuous  source of information to better analyse and understand the whereabouts of incidents in the area of  cyber-security.  Structure of this document  The structure of ETL 2013 is as follows:  2  http://www.ec.europa.eu/digital-agenda/en/news/eu-cybersecurity-plan-protect-open-internet-and-online-freedom-  and-opportunity-cyber-security, accessed 28 Nov 2013.  3  http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2013:165:0041:0058:EN:PDF, accessed 28 Nov 2013.  4  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/risk-management/current-risk/risk-management-inventory/rm-process/rm-  process/crm-strategy/scope-framework, accessed 30 Oct 2013.  http://www.ec.europa.eu/digital-agenda/en/news/eu-cybersecurity-plan-protect-open-internet-and-online-freedom-and-opportunity-cyber-security http://www.ec.europa.eu/digital-agenda/en/news/eu-cybersecurity-plan-protect-open-internet-and-online-freedom-and-opportunity-cyber-security http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2013:165:0041:0058:EN:PDF http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/risk-management/current-risk/risk-management-inventory/rm-process/rm-process/crm-strategy/scope-framework http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/risk-management/current-risk/risk-management-inventory/rm-process/rm-process/crm-strategy/scope-framework  ENISA Threat Landscape 2013  Overview of current and emerging cyber-threats  11 December 2013  Page  3  In the chapter entitled “Purpose Scope and Method” we provide information about the scope of this  work, methods followed in the process of information collection, the position of ETL within the risk  assessment and risk management process and, finally the terminology used.  The chapter “Overview of Threat Agents” provides information about the cyber-adversaries. It  provides information about their motives and capabilities. Moreover, it shows what kinds of threats  are assumed within each threat agent group.  The chapter “Current Threat Landscape” provides information about the top 15 threats assessed this  year. For each threat a short description is provided, together with a number of issues concerning  developments within this threat. Moreover, the trends, other related threats and a graphical  representation of the threat within the attack workflow/kill chain are presented.  The chapter “Emerging Threat Landscape” provides information about threat trends in emerging  technology areas. For each emerging area, the top 10 threats are mentioned together with the  corresponding trends. Following this, a number of emerging issues related to threats and cyber- security in general are also delivered.  Finally, ETL 2013 is concluded by the chapter “Food for Thought: Lessons Learned and Conclusions”.  In this chapter the summarized experience in performing this task for a second year is being  presented, together with the conclusions showing open issues and future activities in the subject  matter.  At this point it should be stressed that particular emphasis was given to keeping ETL 2013 as  modular as possible. Chapters of this document have been developed in a way to comprise content  modules that are as independent as possible. The objective behind this decision is to enable  selective updates of the content of each module: should, for example, a midyear current threat  landscape be developed, the corresponding chapter can be taken as basis for the relevant updates.  This will save resources and maintain the consistency of the entire content.

In this year’s ETL, we will give an overview of its purpose by highlighting the major objectives to be  met by this document6. It is worth mentioning, that through the learning curve we have been  through in two years of ETL, some shifts/improvements in our practices have been introduced.  These developments are also reflected in the present chapter.  The purpose of ETL is to provide answers to the following key questions with regard to threats in  cyberspace and the purpose of ETL:  What is a threat landscape?  A threat landscape is a collection of threats. This information contains identified threats, trends  observed and threat agents involved. ETL consists of a list with top threats prioritized according to  the frequency of appearance and NOT according to the impact caused. The reason for this approach  is that we do not see ourselves in the position to objectively decide about impact levels. As  explained below in this section, this is a task that has to be left to the discretion of the asset owner.  Why does the threat landscape change?  The threat landscape, also called threat environment7,8,9,10, is a dynamically changing ecosystem.  Main forces contributing to these changes are: increased complexity of IT-products, various external  forces such as financial crisis, new vulnerabilities, sophistication of available tools and attacks,  available resources (both personnel and monetary), available skills, networks enabling knowledge  transfer and growth of illegal profits in cyberspace.  How many kinds of threat landscape exist?  Various types of threat landscape exist, depending on their orientation with regard to threatened  assets and with regard to the time horizon taken into account. Examples of sector oriented threat  landscapes are: a financial sector threat landscape, CIIP threat landscape11, health sector threat  landscape12. Examples of threat landscapes taking into account time are: current threat landscape13,  emerging threat landscape14, future threats15. Of particular importance are emerging threat  5  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/risk-management/evolving-threat-  environment/ENISA_Threat_Landscape/at_download/fullReport, accessed 18 Oct 2013.  6  Individuals interested in the details of ETL purpose may also refer to chapter “3 Scope and Definitions” of ETL 2012.  7 http://www.fbi.gov/news/testimony/protecting-the-nation-in-todays-complex-threat-environment, accessed 21 Oct  2013.  8  http://defensetech.org/2010/01/11/the-2010-cyber-threat-environment/, accessed 21 Oct 2013.  9  http://www.symantec.com/connect/blogs/changing-threat-environment-requires-mssps-adapt-their-approach, accessed  21 Oct 2013.  10  http://securityintelligence.com/keeping-up-with-the-changing-threat-environment/, accessed 21 Oct 2013.  11  An ENISA deliverable on Smart Grid Threat Landscape is going to be published soon.

What is the content of ETL?  ETL contains a summary of the current threat landscape and an emerging threat landscape. The  current threat landscape contains consolidated, prioritized list of threats that have been identified  by collecting publicly available threat information (see Chapter 3). The emerging threat landscape  presents threat trends in various key areas of information technology. Moreover, ETL provides  information on threat agents.  What has been left out from ETL?  In general, ETL is covering cyber-threats. Hence, threats resulting from the physical environment  (environmental,deliberate human actions, etc.) are not considered within this document. In this  year’s threat landscape we have not included any geographical data on threat distribution. Also,  threats that are not explicitly related to IT have been left out. Finally, attack patterns have not been  included in this year’s ETL. It is planned to cover these issue in prospective threat landscapes  depending on stakeholder demand and resource availability.  How many reports have been analysed and how have they been collected?  ENISA has analysed over 250 sources for the present threat analysis. The sources collected were  reports from private and public sector, information from blogs, discussions, prsentations, etc. They  have been collected by using Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) methods (see also chapter 2.4).  2.2 Scope, Rationale and Structure of ETL  In order to identify required protection levels of valuable assets it is common to perform a risk  assessment. Subsequently, security measures have to be introduced to achieve this protection by  mitigating (part of) the assessed risks. Other risks might be transferred or accepted. As discussed  below, threats are an important element in risk assessment.  In this chapter we present the scope of the ENISA Threat Landscape (ETL). It consists of a number of  threats to which IT and IT related assets are exposed. Hence, the presented threat landscape is an  important tool for those who want to assess the risks within an IT environment of any complexity.  Based on these risks, appropriate security measures can be selected to achieve risk mitigation.  The role of threats in the risk assessment equations becomes evident when looking at the  components of risks. According to the widely accepted ISO 27005 definition risks emerge when:  “Threats abuse vulnerabilities of assets to generate harm for the organization”. In more detailed  terms, we consider risk as taking into account the following elements:  Asset (Vulnerabilities, Controls), Threat (Threat Agent Profile, Likelihood) and Impact  The elements of risks are graphically depicted in the figure below:  ENISA Threat Landscape 2013  Overview of current and emerging cyber-threats  11 December 2013  Page  8  Figure 1: Threats targeting an asset by trying to exploit its vulnerabilities.  This figure has been adopted from ISO 13335-4 and shows how how threat agents (TA), deploying  threats (T) , try to exploit asset vulnerabilities (V) in order to harm/take over the asset. The asset  owner has implemented security measures (M) to protect the asset, that is, to eliminate negative  effects from threat exposure. The impact achieved by the potential materialization of a threat is the  final element to evaluate the risk of an asset (see also risk definition above).  While the definition of risks for an asset is a quite straight forward task, in complex environments it  is often a challenge to assess risks. This is due to interdependencies between assets, cascading  effects of vulnerabilities, dynamics in threat environment, capabilities of threat agents, attack  methods, etc.  From the above becomes clear that in order to assess risks, all elements of the risk equation need to  be available. ETL contributes to the understanding of the threat environment. With this information  at hand, asset owners will be in the position to assess risks applying to the assets they own. We  consider this as a win-win situation: ETL reflects changes in the dynamic threat environment to  support the ones who own and master the complexity of assets.  In fact, ETL is asset agnostic- that is- it does not assume any particular environment and/or the  processes implemented through it. The assessment of consequences of these threats to assets is left  to the asset owner. To this extent, ETL is a supporting tool for the performance of risk assessments.  Such a tool may be essential for the asset owner: the dynamics and main trends of the complex  threat environment are key to the assessment of the inherently complex, interdependent assets.  In this document, we provide information on threats and threat exposure in a consolidated form  compiled by analysing publicly available reports. In addition, we deliver information on how these  threats behave within certain areas/domains. This is done in terms of a prioritization of threats and  of identification of trends related to each area/domain.

The subject areas for the  specialized, sector oriented threat landscapes are identified with the support of ENISA stakeholders.  Finally, and in order to cover significant events in the area of cyber security, flash notes have been  defined as part of this work. With flash notes28, ENISA responds to important/high impact events  with statements consolidating published information, while at the same time – when relevant -  proposing mitigation/protection measures and/or establishing the context to activities at EU level.  In 2013, besides ETL (the present report), ENISA delivers two sector specific threat landscapes in the  areas of Smart Grid11 and Trust Services16.  The structure of the ETL 2013 is presented in Figure 2 below. The process behind the creation of ETL  is described in the forthcoming chapter (see chapter 2.4 below).  Figure 2: Structure and content of ETL stream of work within ENISA in 2013.  2.4 Methods and tools  The method followed for the creation of ETL is information collection, analysis and collation. As input  to these activities solely public information is used. Hence, the method we follow goes beyond pure  information research and uses the principles of Open-Source Intelligence17 (OSINT): it serves the  collection and dissemination of information to the appropriate audience in order to address threat  exposure in cyber space18 in a timely manner. Through this activity a basic level on intelligence on  cyber threats can be achieved that can be used in various cyber security assessment activities.  16  An ENISA deliverable on Tust Services is going to be published soon.

OSINT is particularly effective when collecting information about globally  relevant events, such as cyber threats and comprises a good practice in this area19,20,21. This is  because threat information can be identified timely and information from various sources can be  cross-checked and combined in order to establish the desired context, that is, to understand an  incident and find evidence about the whereabouts of the deployment and impact achieved. There  are online tools related to OSINT22,23,24. In this year’s ETL, available OSINT tools and their  relevance/capabilities/content has not been assessed by ENISA.  The performance of open source search assumes a set of skills related with the ability to find,  understand and validate required information25. The skills/challenges for open source searches are:  Understand who is knowledgeable: It is important to understand which sources provide what  information and how to find and follow-up on these sources. Examples are knowledgeable  individuals in social networking, blogs and online media. Due to the nature of threat information, it  is crucial to track available information timely.  Evaluate quality and accuracy of information: In the technological area of cyber security, details  matter. Hence, quality and accuracy of the collected information is an important attribute. It helps  to spot ambiguity/bias and to understand the origin of a threat, weaknesses exploited and potential  protection. This can be achieved via source validation26.  Filter the identified information: Once qualitative information has been identified, it needs to be  filtered in such a way to comply with the level, structure/attribution and context required for the  purpose at hand. This can be achieved by parsing the identified information on the basis of  structure/templates that reflect information requirements.  Find the right levels to store, associate and communicate: Once information has been filtered and  properly structured, ways to store it need to be found in order to serve the usability criteria set.  Moreover, both core and dynamic interconnections/relationships between stored information  objects need to be maintained/identified for future use cases. Last but not least, it is important to  find the right level and structure in order to present assessed information according to target group  profile(s).  Just as during 2012, ETL 2013 is based on information from reports and publications issued by actors  such as: Virus/Malware protection vendors; Information service of CERT-EU27; National security  agencies; Industrial associations and standardisation bodies; Commercial companies in the area of  cyber security; Networks of excellence; Academic institutions; Individual information security  experts.  ETL information collection has been performed over the following channels: Online media; Web- based content and information services; Social media content; Publicly available reports and  publications; Participation in relevant events; Discussions with various experts. It is remarkable that  in this year’s work, the channel of social media has proved to be very efficient in collecting  19  http://resources.infosecinstitute.com/using-osint-in-your-business/, accessed 23 Oct 2013.  20  http://www.infosecisland.com/download/index/id/109.html, accessed 23 Oct 2013.  21  http://clusit.it/docs/Rapporto_Clusit%202013_ENG.pdf, accessed 23 Oct 2013.  22  http://opensourcerss.net/, accessed 30 Oct 2013.  23  http://searchsecurity.techtarget.in/photostory/2240160102/Nine-must-have-OSINT-tools/1/Nine-OSINT-tools-every- security-researcher-must-have, accessed 30 Oct 2013.  24  http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/cybersecurity/Cybersecurity_Annotated_Bibliography, accessed 30 Oct 2013.  25  http://www.theosintgroup.com/open_source_intelligence.html, accessed 23 Oct 2013.  26  http://jeffreycarr.blogspot.co.uk/2013/11/in-osint-all-sources-arent-created-equal.html, accessed 2 Dec 2013.  27  http://cert.europa.eu/cert/filteredition/en/CERT-LatestNews.html, accessed 30 Oct 2013.  http://resources.infosecinstitute.com/using-osint-in-your-business/ http://www.infosecisland.com/download/index/id/109.html http://clusit.it/docs/Rapporto_Clusit%202013_ENG.pdf http://opensourcerss.net/ http://searchsecurity.techtarget.in/photostory/2240160102/Nine-must-have-OSINT-tools/1/Nine-OSINT-tools-every-security-researcher-must-have http://searchsecurity.techtarget.in/photostory/2240160102/Nine-must-have-OSINT-tools/1/Nine-OSINT-tools-every-security-researcher-must-have http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/cybersecurity/Cybersecurity_Annotated_Bibliography http://www.theosintgroup.com/open_source_intelligence.html http://jeffreycarr.blogspot.co.uk/2013/11/in-osint-all-sources-arent-created-equal.html http://cert.europa.eu/cert/filteredition/en/CERT-LatestNews.html  ENISA Threat Landscape 2013  Overview of current and emerging cyber-threats  11 December 2013  Page  11  information. By following various individuals and organisations, we were able to become aware of  issued reports and announcements very quickly.  Time matters in cyber security: the quicker an event has been spotted, reported and analysed, the  less the impact and the quicker a weakness will be fixed. For this reason ENISA has introduced  various ways of  covering cyber security incident/threat announcements. Significant events are  covered timely by means of flash notes28. Furthermore, as it was the case this year29, ENISA issues  midyear ETL reports in order to summarize important developments in threat landscape in the  middle of the reporting year. Finally, around year’s end the yearly ETL (the present document) is  issued. It is worth mentioning that this dissemination strategy is still at the beginning and is currently  under further development/evaluation/optimization.  2.5 Building Threat Intelligence: The Workflow of Attacks  As already mentioned in ETL 2012, building intelligence about cyber-threats is a consequent next  step following threat and vulnerability analysis. This intelligence is related to the understanding of  patterns that are common to attack scenarios. Hence the objective is to depart from simply listing  threats and vulnerabilities and try to understand patterns that are characteristic for attacks: the  workflow of attacks. In this workflow, threats, technical vulnerabilities, threat agents and user  actions are being put in connection. The causal relationship between them provides an end-to-end  perspective of all steps involved in an attack. Threat analysis - and in particular the identification of  top threats - provides significant insights into the whereabouts of an attack, yet it does not make up  the whole story. There are some additional elements making up an attack.  In various on-going activities in threat analysis and threat intelligence, approaches have been  developed to allow for a coherent representation of all indicators, actions and actors involved in an  attack30,31,32. This goes beyond the description of cyber-threats and includes information about the  campaign, observations made, indicators, protection, incidents and targeted asset.  The proliferation of such approaches requires significant effort in building the context of an attack  including information collection and analysis, incident data, threat agent information, exploitation  strategies. Although all these issues are important for the development of threat intelligence, within  the current version of ETL we consider as feasible to proceed with an initial step towards threat  intelligence by adding to assessed threat some information about the role of a threat in the  workflow of an attack. This will be performed by means of a marker (i.e. a bar spanning the relevant  steps) in the attack workflow to indicate in which step of the attack a particular threat is being  utilized. The use of attack workflows/kill chain is considered as a facilitator for building threat  intelligence. There is a long way to go in this direction. It is proposed that relevant players elaborate  further on this concept to provide more specialized information towards defending assets (see also  conclusions at the end of this document).  For this purpose we adopt the work done in “Kill Chains”33. A kill chain is a set of generic steps  characterising attacks. In particular, a kill chain consists of the following seven steps:  28  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/flash-notes, accessed 23 Oct 2013.  29  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/risk-management/evolving-threat-environment/enisa-threat-landscape-mid- year-2013, accessed 23 Oct 2013.  30  http://stix.mitre.org/, accessed 27 Nov 2013.  31  http://capec.mitre.org/, accessed 27 Nov 2013.  32  http://www.lockheedmartin.com/content/dam/lockheed/data/corporate/documents/LM-White-Paper-Intel-Driven- Defense.pdf, accessed 27 Nov 2013.  33  http://www.lockheedmartin.com/content/dam/lockheed/data/corporate/documents/LM-White-Paper-Intel-Driven- Defense.pdf, accessed 2 Dec 2013.  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/flash-notes http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/risk-management/evolving-threat-environment/enisa-threat-landscape-mid-year-2013 http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/risk-management/evolving-threat-environment/enisa-threat-landscape-mid-year-2013 http://stix.mitre.org/ http://capec.mitre.org/ http://www.lockheedmartin.com/content/dam/lockheed/data/corporate/documents/LM-White-Paper-Intel-Driven-Defense.pdf http://www.lockheedmartin.com/content/dam/lockheed/data/corporate/documents/LM-White-Paper-Intel-Driven-Defense.pdf http://www.lockheedmartin.com/content/dam/lockheed/data/corporate/documents/LM-White-Paper-Intel-Driven-Defense.pdf http://www.lockheedmartin.com/content/dam/lockheed/data/corporate/documents/LM-White-Paper-Intel-Driven-Defense.pdf  ENISA Threat Landscape 2013  Overview of current and emerging cyber-threats  11 December 2013  Page  12  Reconnaissance: is the action of researching and analysing information about the target and the  environment within which the attack will be deployed. In this phase, assumptions for the number  and kind of vulnerabilities to be exploited are being made.  Weaponization: is the phase where the malicious payload to be used has been selected and  “loaded”, that is, made ready for use for the target environment.  Delivery: is the action of transmission of the malicious payload to the target environment.  Exploitation: is the act of letting the delivered payload make his job by exploiting vulnerabilities that  are available in the target environment. Usually these are technical vulnerabilities but in some  attacks these may well also be systemic or organisational vulnerabilities including humans.  Installation: is the phase where the delivered payload has successfully exploited a vulnerability and  has been installed in the target environment.  Command and Control (C2): in this step the installed payload establishes outbound connection to  the controller environment in order to enable interaction with the adversary who launched the  attack.  Action on Objectives: this is the final phase of a successful attack where the threat agent is in the  position to take over the targeted asset. Depending on the kind of target, this activity may include  information retrieval, information manipulation, application misuse, etc.  The instrument of attack workflow has various use cases, depending on the available information on  an attack (e.g. desktop analysis, reverse engineering based on an incident, tracking of malicious  activities based on data, etc.). Within ETL, attack workflows (also referred to as kill chains) are used  to indicatively determine the role of an assessed threat within the seven phases of an attack. Due to  the fact that we take into account incident information but we do not perform incident analysis, the  threat information delivered in this report will be merely mapped among the first 6 phases of the  attack workflow. This is because ETL is based on desktop analysis and does not consider  consequences of successful attacks (incidents) that took place in the reporting period. However, for  some threats that inherently contain the targeted asset, step seven will be taken into account (i.e.  Denial of Service, Physical Damage/Theft/Loss, Data Breaches and Targeted Attacks).  The role of a threat in the attack workflow will be presented graphically, as shown in the example of  the figure below.  Figure 3: An example of attack workflow showing the role of Code Injection threat.  2.6 Used definitions  Just as in many complex areas, in cyber threat assessment wording matters. In the present section  we briefly present the terms used. Both within and outside this report, definitions facilitate the  understanding of used terms; further, and equally importantly, consistent use of terms contributes  towards better, quicker and more efficient knowledge transfer on cyber threats. This may enhance  the response capabilities to cyber threats.

In order to visualize the relationships  among all elements of risks, we use a figure taken from ISO 15408:2005 (see Figure 4). This figure  has a level of granularity that is sufficient to illustrate most of the elements of risk mentioned in this  section. It should be noted that “owner” refers to the owner of the asset; moreover, the issue of  attack pattern is not displayed in this figure. Attack patterns have been left out of the scope of this  report and will be subject of forthcoming work in the area of threat landscape.

It is worth mentioning that Figure 4 and  Figure 1 have intentional redundancies: yet they serve a different view and together they complete  the picture of the focus set and the terminology used in this report.

The material presented is the Current Treat Landscape 2013. The assessment is  based on reports that have been published until ca. mid of November 2013. Hence, the present  report takes into account relevant publications and information that spans approximately one year  (December 2012-November 2013). The remaining publications from this year will flow into the ETL  2014, eventually in form of a mid-year and an end year report.  As already stated, the assessed threats have been prioritized according to the frequency of their  appearance/reference in corresponding reports. The references found are mostly based on detected  incidents and infections. In some cases, they are based on estimated appearances of a threat, for  example regarding spam and denial of service. In prioritizing these threats within a single list, the  need to extrapolate those values arose. In the presentation of the threats below, more frequent  threats are mentioned first.  Having said that, it is worth mentioning that further prioritization criteria are also feasible, such as  geographical spread, classification according to categories of impacted assets, according to threat  agents, according to kind of organisations affected, etc. We have chosen appearance frequency as  the priority scheme to balance available resources and quality of the required analysis. During the  reporting period, various stakeholders have proposed using additional schemes, in particular  geographic spread (i.e. regarding European territory) and size of organisations affected (i.e. large  organisations vs. SMEs). These requests are under consideration and the feasibility of their  implementation will be evaluated in upcoming versions of ETL.  In the following discussion, the top 15 threats from end 2012 to end 2013 can be found. Threat  descriptions consist of i) a short text explaining the whereabouts of the threat, ii) a list of findings, iii)  the trend observed in the reporting period, iv) other related threats that are used in combination to  a threat and v) the position of the threat in the attack workflow.  This chapter is concluded by a comparison between the current threat landscapes of ETL 2012 and  ETL 2013. This will help readers to easily understand the changes of the current threat landscape in  this time period.  3.1 Drive-By Downloads  Web based attacks implementing drive-by downloads scores for one more year as the top cyber  threat. This is quite natural as web browsers are the first level of user interaction with the Internet.  As such, web pages, web servers and web services have become the most important attack surface:  attackers target web sites with the aim to infect them with malicious code, usually exploit kits (see  corresponding threat below). Infected web sites are referred to as malicious URLs and are “door  openers” for other threats such as exploit kits and malicious code infections (i.e. Worms/Trojans).  Visitors of these web sites are automatically scanned through the maliciously installed exploit kits for  weaknesses/vulnerabilities. Once vulnerabilities have been found in the device of the visitor, exploit  kits automatically install the appropriate malware on the device. The installed malware may vary  significantly according to the underlying user system/configuration and the vulnerabilities found.  This threat belongs to the broad category of unauthorised software installation to the victim’s  device: starting from a victim web server and reaching the devices of visitors.  In the reporting period we have assessed that:  ENISA Threat Landscape 2013  Overview of current and emerging cyber-threats  11 December 2013  Page  17   Web based attacks remain as the number one threat. Malicious URLs are considered the main  channel for malware installation. It has been observed that there is a shift from Botnets to URLs  as means for malware distribution56.   Java remains the most exploited software34,35  to infect a web site. In addition, attackers use code  injection attacks (see threat below) to create malicious URLs47.   As predicted in 2012, drive-by downloads have fully embraced mobile platforms. Just as any  other device, mobile platforms are targeted by vulnerability scanning capabilities of exploit kits.   As mentioned in the code injection threat below, manipulated CMSs are another source for the  creation of malicious URLs36,37.   Web based attacks are increasingly used within targeted attacks. Through the watering hole  technique, attackers lure a specific group of victims to visit their malicious URLs. This technique  has been increasingly used in 2013 with high infection rates38,47 (see also threat below).  Observed current trend for this threat: increasing  Related threats: Code Injection, Exploit Kits, Worms/Trojans, Rogueware/Ransomware/Scareware,  Targeted Attacks, Watering Hole.

Malware and particularly trojans have been derived from previous versions in  thousands of variants. This is due to the use of available toolkits allowing for the generation of user  defined malware through variations of existing malware code. Due to functionality offered by  toolkits, this activity can be performed by adversaries with moderate capabilities. The vast number  of malware variations is deployed as an effective method to fool signature-based virus scanners: due  to their large numbers, signatures of the created variants are not always available, leading thus to  unnoticed infections. Mobile platforms supported the successful deployment of this threat. Mobile  malware takes a significant part in malware statistics.  In the reporting period we have assessed that:  34  http://www.kaspersky.com/about/news/virus/2012/Oracle_Java_surpasses_Adobe_Reader_as_the_most_frequently_ex ploited_software, accessed 8 August 2013.  35  http://globenewswire.com/news-release/2013/07/18/561078/10041006/en/Bit9-Research-Shows-Java-is-Most- Targeted-Endpoint-Technology-for-Cyber-Attacks-Widely-Deployed-Older-Versions-Represent-Greatest-Risk.html,  accessed 8 August 2013.  36  http://www.symantec.com/connect/blogs/risk-content-management-systems, accessed 18 Nov 2013.  37  https://www.bsi.bund.de/DE/Publikationen/Studien/CMS/Studie_CMS.html, accessed 18 Nov 2013.  38  http://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/14725/hacking/watering-hole-attacks-exploit-kits-indian-gov-site-case.html,  accessed 18 Nov 2013.  http://www.kaspersky.com/about/news/virus/2012/Oracle_Java_surpasses_Adobe_Reader_as_the_most_frequently_exploited_software http://www.kaspersky.com/about/news/virus/2012/Oracle_Java_surpasses_Adobe_Reader_as_the_most_frequently_exploited_software http://globenewswire.com/news-release/2013/07/18/561078/10041006/en/Bit9-Research-Shows-Java-is-Most-Targeted-Endpoint-Technology-for-Cyber-Attacks-Widely-Deployed-Older-Versions-Represent-Greatest-Risk.html http://globenewswire.com/news-release/2013/07/18/561078/10041006/en/Bit9-Research-Shows-Java-is-Most-Targeted-Endpoint-Technology-for-Cyber-Attacks-Widely-Deployed-Older-Versions-Represent-Greatest-Risk.html http://www.symantec.com/connect/blogs/risk-content-management-systems https://www.bsi.bund.de/DE/Publikationen/Studien/CMS/Studie_CMS.html http://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/14725/hacking/watering-hole-attacks-exploit-kits-indian-gov-site-case.html  ENISA Threat Landscape 2013  Overview of current and emerging cyber-threats  11 December 2013  Page  18   Malware increasingly targets mobile platforms, with mobile trojans coming at the first position.  This is due to the increasing use of mobile devices, the increased sophistication of attacks (see  below) but also due to the weaker/immature security mechanisms implemented on these  platforms.   Available attack tools (see also exploit kits) allow for the creation of malware variants based on  available malware code. This activity can be performed even from users with moderate  capabilities. This phenomenon is called polymorphism of existing code and is a key trend in  malware development.   An increased sophistication in malware has been reported, especially on mobile platforms. Code  obfuscation (i.e. code that bypasses vetting process of gated app stores) and use of multiple  channels use are some characteristics of the complexity of malware39.   Coordinated activities of developers have demonstrated their true potential in generating  sophisticated malware by launching malware attacks against Mac computers40,47.   There is a growing black/grey market for stolen user data41. This brings information stealing  malware on the rise. Given the increased use mobile devices and the sophistication of attacks,  information stealing malware is here to stay.   Rogue certificates have been used to sign malicious code and thus distribute signed apps42. This  has demonstrated that incidents with rogue certificates are still a serious risk that cannot be  easily mitigated109,43.  Observed current trend for this threat: increasing  Related threats: Drive-by Downloads, Code Injection, Exploit Kits, Botnets, Identity Theft/, Data  Breaches, Rogueware/Ransomware/Scareware, Phishing, Targeted Attacks.

Within 2013 Code injection attacks are on sharp rise. The proliferation of automated attack tools  impacted the frequency of this threat in the reporting period: hackers are in the position to launch  large vulnerability scans in short time.

Due to their wide use, popular CMSs make up a considerable attack surface that  has drawn the attention of cyber-criminals44,45.   Large scale automated attacks are being increasingly launched from within cloud service  provider networks61.   Code injections are combined with other threats to successfully infect victims144. A typical  example in the reporting period is a series of incidents that have been caused by successful  attacks combining SQLi together with spear-phishing and watering hole techniques46.  Observed current trend for this threat: increasing  Related threats: Drive-by Downloads, Exploit Kits, Data Breaches, Targeted Attacks.  Reconnaissance Weaponisation Delivery Exploitation Installation Command and Control  Actions on Objectives  Code Injection  Step of Attack Workflow  Width of Purpose  Figure 7: Position of Code Injection in attack workflow  3.4 Exploit Kits  Exploit kits are the main tools in the hands of threat agents. These are ready-to-use software tools  offering a large variety of functions, configuration options and automated means to launch attacks.  Exploit kits search for vulnerabilities in order to abuse them and launch any applicable attack to take  over an asset (also mentioned as Exploit attacks47). Exploit kits have been heavily used by hackers  within the reporting period. Further, it has been reported that new business models emerge around  such tools: developers of exploit kits maintain interaction with customers by offering support,  customized configurations, etc48,49. The ability for updating, customization and the degree of  automation provided is considered to be one of the main parameters for increase in all kinds of  threats supported, such as malware, code injections, exploitation of vulnerabilities, etc.  In the reporting period we have assessed that:   Exploit kits are entering a new era of higher maturity towards developer/user relationship.  Additional “services”50,51 are developed and it seems that developers and users of exploit kits are  two distinct types of cyber threat agents.  44  http://www.h-online.com/open/news/item/CMSs-mostly-vulnerable-through-addons-says-German-security-agency- 1894431.html, accessed 8 August 2013.  45  http://securitywatch.pcmag.com/security/310350-wordpress-joomla-sites-under-brute-force-password-attack, accessed  8 August 2013.  46  http://www.infosecurity-magazine.com/view/33493/water-hole-replacing-spearphishing-as-statesponsored-weapon-of-  choice/, accessed 2 Dec 2103.  47  http://www.f-secure.com/static/doc/labs_global/Research/Threat_Report_H1_2013.pdf, accessed 4 Nov 2013.  48  http://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/what-to-expect-from-toolkits-and-exploit-kits-this-2013/,  accessed 4 Nov 2013.  49  http://networksasia.net/article/cybercrime-exposed-cybercrime-service-1372901941, accessed 7 Nov 2013.  50  https://blog.damballa.com/archives/1893, accessed 18 Nov 2013.  51  http://resources.infosecinstitute.com/cybercrime-as-a-service/, accessed 18 Nov 2013.  http://www.h-online.com/open/news/item/CMSs-mostly-vulnerable-through-addons-says-German-security-agency-1894431.html http://www.h-online.com/open/news/item/CMSs-mostly-vulnerable-through-addons-says-German-security-agency-1894431.html http://securitywatch.pcmag.com/security/310350-wordpress-joomla-sites-under-brute-force-password-attack http://www.infosecurity-magazine.com/view/33493/water-hole-replacing-spearphishing-as-statesponsored-weapon-of-choice/ http://www.infosecurity-magazine.com/view/33493/water-hole-replacing-spearphishing-as-statesponsored-weapon-of-choice/ http://www.f-secure.com/static/doc/labs_global/Research/Threat_Report_H1_2013.pdf http://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/what-to-expect-from-toolkits-and-exploit-kits-this-2013/ http://networksasia.net/article/cybercrime-exposed-cybercrime-service-1372901941 https://blog.damballa.com/archives/1893 http://resources.infosecinstitute.com/cybercrime-as-a-service/  ENISA Threat Landscape 2013  Overview of current and emerging cyber-threats  11 December 2013  Page  20   Users are confronted to exploit kits mostly by accessing compromised URLs (see threat drive-by  downloads above).   Due to the popularity of exploit kits and the emerging need to feed them with known  vulnerabilities, there is an increasing interest in zero-day vulnerabilities. This is a significant  amplification effect for the market of exploits/vulnerabilities52. It is important to note that both  hostile and friendly actors in cyber space show interest in purchasing zero-day vulnerabilities47.   Efforts have been invested by exploit kit developers to encrypt their payloads, thus make them  invisible from detection mechanisms53.   Due to the existence of a market, it is expected that a developers instead of developing new  malware, will concentrate on development of exploit kits48. Rather, exploit kits will be able to  include new malware and available vulnerabilities.   The developer and operator of Blackhole54, the most successful exploit kit has been arrested. It  will be very interesting to observe future developments with this malicious tool. Are other threat  agents going to take over development and operation of Blackhole or its derivates? Are other  tools going to fill the possibly created gap? It is suggested to keep an eye on this issue, as it going  to introduce significant impact to the threat landscape.  Observed current trend for this threat: increasing  Related threats: Drive-by Downloads, Code Injection, Worms/Trojans, Phishing,  Rogueware/Ransomware/Scareware.

Being one of the oldest and more “mature” malicious infrastructures in cyber space, botnets  currently undergo significant changes in their adaptation, reduction of traceability, business cases,  channels used and technology usage. In the reporting period we have seen some of these changes  become reality. The use of peer-to-peer technologies, not only increases the resilience of single  nodes, it also enhances their ability to stay undetected. Although this development has been  observed since 2012, the benefits of this technology have been demonstrated in 2013, as they can  run on cloud infrastructures. Noticeable changes in the business models include a shift from botnets  to URLs as means to install malware. Further, the botnet business model has concentrated on  Bitcoin mining55. In addition, click fraud payloads have been deployed.  52  http://www.forbes.com/sites/andygreenberg/2012/03/23/shopping-for-zero-days-an-price-list-for-hackers-secret- software-exploits/, accessed 4 Nov 2013.  53  http://resources.infosecinstitute.com/battling-cyber-warriors-exploit-kits/, accessed 18 Nov 2013.  54  http://www.zdnet.com/blackhole-malware-toolkit-creator-paunch-arrested-7000021740/, accessed 28 Nov 2013.  55  http://www.fortinet.com/press_releases/2013/fortiguard_threat_landscape_research_team_reports.html, accessed 4  Nov 2013.  http://www.forbes.com/sites/andygreenberg/2012/03/23/shopping-for-zero-days-an-price-list-for-hackers-secret-software-exploits/ http://www.forbes.com/sites/andygreenberg/2012/03/23/shopping-for-zero-days-an-price-list-for-hackers-secret-software-exploits/ http://resources.infosecinstitute.com/battling-cyber-warriors-exploit-kits/ http://www.zdnet.com/blackhole-malware-toolkit-creator-paunch-arrested-7000021740/ http://www.fortinet.com/press_releases/2013/fortiguard_threat_landscape_research_team_reports.html  ENISA Threat Landscape 2013  Overview of current and emerging cyber-threats  11 December 2013  Page  21  In the reporting period we have assessed that:   Threat analysts see malicious URLs replacing botnets as the primary means for distribution  malware (see also drive-by downloads above)56. Botnets are on decline with regard to this  threat.   Existing botnet infrastructure has been updated with P2P technology57. This increases resilience  of botnet nodes when servers are taken down.   Existing versions of botnet infrastructure are equipped with Bitcoin mining and click fraud  functions. At the same time, they continue targeting social networks with spam.   Botnets sometimes use the anonymizing network TOR. Lately malware families have been found  using TOR as communication network58. It can be assumed that a considerable part of the vast  increase of TOR traffic is caused by its use for malicious purposes59,60.   Although botnet malware infections are on the decline56, it seems that botnets are still one of  the most important cyber threats. The reasons for can be found in changes of malware infection  strategies, use of P2P technology, use of anonymizing technologies etc.   Within the current trend of cyber-crime-as-a-service, we see various “traditional” botnet  functions to be offered as a service; similarly the availability of hosting services makes the use of  cloud as a high performance botnet feasible61,62.

Meanwhile, it is considered that  hacking is not the main cause of data loss: ca. 36% of data breaches are attributed to theft/loss of  devices64.  In the reporting period we have assessed that:   Damage of devices seems to be the number one cause for losing data63. And although users are  concerned about cyber-attacks, the awareness about the possibility of a damage/loss of device  seems to be rather low. In this area there is a lot of space for improvements.   As already assessed within the threat of data breach (see above), a significant part of data  breaches is caused through physical access to the storage device. Theft/damage/loss seems to  be the main cause for this65.   Most of the data on damage, theft or loss are based on surveys/statistics and not on incidents.  This is due to the fact that related incidents on physical damage, theft and loss are not always  reported and gathered. Hence concluded damages (and costs118) are just estimations that need  to be validated.   To reduce the impact of the damage/theft/loss threat, it is noticeable that the following factors  play a significant role towards a reduction of incurred costs: “strong security posture, incident  response capabilities and appointment of a CISO”118.

Identity theft is one of the core activities of many threat agent  groups, as it gives access to a lot of data that bear potential for numerous malicious activities.  Malware and trojans belong to the main tools to perform identity theft. In 2013, for example,  financial trojans (e.g. Zeus, SpyEye, Citadel67)  have been use to implement 2-factor authentication  attack on mobile platforms68. The interest in identity theft, but also its importance in deploying  multiple attacks has led to the creation of a market for this kind of data96. It is expected, that this  threat will continue increasing, as the methods used increase in sophistication and spread.  In the reporting period we have assessed that:  63  http://media.kaspersky.com/pdf/Kaspersky_Lab_B2C_Summary_2013_final_EN.pdf, accessed 7 Nov 2013.  64  http://www.symantec.com/connect/blogs/symantec-intelligence-report-may-2013, accessed 7 Nov 2013.  65  http://www.acronis.com/download/docs/glme/whitepaper2 , accessed 7 November 2013.  66  http://krebsonsecurity.com/2013/09/data-broker-giants-hacked-by-id-theft-service/, accessed 19 Nov 2013.  67  http://www.mcafee.com/us/resources/white-papers/wp-citadel-trojan.pdf, accessed 7 Nov 2013.  68  http://www.emc.com/collateral/fraud-report/current-state-cybercrime-2013.pdf, accessed 7 Nov 2013.  http://media.kaspersky.com/pdf/Kaspersky_Lab_B2C_Summary_2013_final_EN.pdf http://www.symantec.com/connect/blogs/symantec-intelligence-report-may-2013 http://krebsonsecurity.com/2013/09/data-broker-giants-hacked-by-id-theft-service/ http://www.mcafee.com/us/resources/white-papers/wp-citadel-trojan.pdf http://www.emc.com/collateral/fraud-report/current-state-cybercrime-2013.pdf  ENISA Threat Landscape 2013  Overview of current and emerging cyber-threats  11 December 2013  Page  23   The inclusion of mobile platforms in identity hunting malware is a matter of fact and has  demonstrated the potential behind successful attack on these platforms. As expected, data on  financial and payment institutions are the most prominent ones for identity theft69,70.   A significant source for applying this threat remains social media71. It is worth mentioning that  an increase in malicious browser extensions has been registered, aimed at taking over social  network accounts72,73. A market around social accounts has already been created74   The use of Near Field Communication (NFC) capabilities for financial transactions, exchange of  messages and interaction with other devices increases. This technology will provide an attack  surface, especially with regard to eavesdropping75.   Man-in-the-browser attacks are similar to man-in-the-middle attacks except that the  intervention on an infected device happens over a Trojan that deviates traffic over a botnet (e.g.  SpyEye v1.3 botnet76). Through these attacks, threat agents are stealing almost any information  from the browser memory77.   It is worth noticing how threat agents adapt to additional authentication mechanisms used for  securing identity information, especially in financial transactions. SMS forwarding has been  introduced to existing malware. This includes permissions linked with the SMS relay, whereas PC  injection requests users to ender data that are also displayed on the handset. Hence a  connection between these devices is established. Then the malware takes over SMS  communication with the bank and misuses communicated credentials78 (i.e. man-in-the-mobile).

After the  Spamhaus80 attack, DNS reflection attacks have gained in popularity81,82. DNS reflection amplification  attacks target poorely configured DNS servers. Attackers seem to have adopted the DNS reflection  technique to launch amplification attacks, an old technique that has made a come-back. Another  reason for this increase is assumed in the availability of easy-to-use attack tools that embrace DoS  capabilities82. Users with low skills can easily launch DoS attacks, and, when done in orchestration  with other actors, significant striking power can be developed. Moreover, available high  performance botnets contribute to the increased volume of DoS attacks83. Amplification, wide  availability of tools/resources and coordination among threat agent groups seem to be the reason  for the impressive DoS bandwidths achieved (2-10Gbps up to 300Gbps85,86). The duration of attack  has grown, indicating that attackers are risking detection of their resources (botnets, tools) in order  to maximize impact on the attacked sites  In the reporting period we have assessed that:   Sophistication of DoS attacks grows (multi-vendor and multi-layer attacks) making them difficult  to defend84.   Performance of available DoS attack infrastructure has grown. This includes both use of  technology (amplification) and involved threat agents (coordination, orchestration).   Features of attack infrastructure (see botnets above) such as resilience, clandestine  communication and use of encryption lower detectability and allow for a longer duration of  attacks.   Attack bandwidths achieved have reached impressive levels: the rate of 2-10Gbps attacks has  doubled85 and the level of 300Gbps attack was reached in 201386.   While DoS targets mainly enterprise and commerce it seems that US and Asia Pacific are more  targeted through DoS. Europe has lower attack rates87.   A series of DDoS attacks to banks has drawn the attention of security professional in the  reporting period88.

Tools are e-mails, manipulated  web pages, mobile apps and social media/social gaming. Through the proliferation of mobile  devices, they constitute main targets/channels to obtain user credentials. In this context social  engineering approaches target users over various channels supported in mobile devices such as  voice, instant and short messages and rogue apps. These channels come to complement e-mail as  common phishing delivery method89.  The complexity/sophistication of phishing methods varies as well. Fake websites is the simplest tool  going up to infected web sites, malware and Pharming/DNS manipulations90. The range of  complexity allows all threat agent groups, from novice to experts, to launch phishing attacks47. All in  all, there has been an increase in phishing in 2013, with phishing sites targeting mainly Social  Networking, Financial, Online Services, E-Commerce and Gaming90,91(sequence according to number  of phishing sites). Nevertheless, phishing targets vary from country to country90.  In the reporting period we have assessed that:   Sophistication of phishing increases: in the reporting period we have seen phishing strategies to  include methods that are difficult to spot90 by end users. Moreover, phishing strategies seem to  seek for tactics to fool users of multilevel security procedures introduced by targeted  organisations.   Phishing has a geographic component90,91. Phishing strategies are adapted to cultural, social and  technological development of particular geographic areas. Therefore, phishing mitigation  strategies have to take this dimension into account.   As in other threats assessed, phishing can also be facilitated by easy-to-use tools90. This enables  threat agents with low capabilities to launch phishing attacks.   Phishing is heavily based on web site vulnerabilities92. This fact underlines the importance of in-  depth web site/web application protection strategies.   Powerful hosting environments (i.e. cloud computing), are an important target of phishing  attacks. This is due to the multiplication effect of a successfully mounted attack. This strategy  follows the same pattern as for botnets and DoS attacks, all using the power of virtual  environments and the vast accumulation of data92.  89  http://www.emc.com/collateral/fraud-report/online-rsa-fraud-report-012013.pdf, accessed 5 Nov 2013.  90  http://media.kaspersky.com/pdf/Kaspersky_Lab_KSN_report_The_Evolution_of_Phishing_Attacks_2011-2013.pdf,  accessed 5 November 2013.  91  http://www.microsoft.com/security/sir/default.aspx, accessed 5 Nov 2013.  92  http://docs.apwg.org/reports/APWG_GlobalPhishingSurvey_2H2012.pdf, accessed 5 Nov 2013.  http://www.emc.com/collateral/fraud-report/online-rsa-fraud-report-012013.pdf http://media.kaspersky.com/pdf/Kaspersky_Lab_KSN_report_The_Evolution_of_Phishing_Attacks_2011-2013.pdf http://www.microsoft.com/security/sir/default.aspx http://docs.apwg.org/reports/APWG_GlobalPhishingSurvey_2H2012.pdf  ENISA Threat Landscape 2013  Overview of current and emerging cyber-threats  11 December 2013  Page  26   Threat agents will target end users of financial systems directly in order to obtain important  information to perform fraud90 and achieve profits.

Not only is filtering spam a resource consuming task;  spam is one important channel to spread malware, attract user to malicious URLs, commit fraud, etc.  Hence, defending against this threat is not all about filtering spam but also how to avoid the impact  on end users with regard to fraud and malicious e-mail content. As originating mainly from botnets,  spam has demonstrated an activity that is in analogy to the botnet activity: in the 1st quarter on 2013  we have experienced a dramatic increase56,93, whereas the volume of spam dropped till the 1st half  of the year91,94. Finally, just like almost all other threats, spam has gone mobile: spam with Android  malware has been on the rise95.  In the reporting period we have assessed that:   Spam has a strong geographic component, with spam origin being on the focus91,96: while in  some areas spam traffic in on decline, there are countries with high/very high spam traffic.   Spam content is related mainly (i.e. over 85%) to pharmacy, images, the so called “Nigerian  scam”97, malware and non-pharmacy product ads91. Moreover, spam messages chose  contemporary hot topics from the press to attract potential victims98 (e.g. Boston Marathon  bombings, Pope Francis election, etc.). This might be an important piece of information for end  users.   Tricks used in spam/scam are identity theft targeting social accounts. This is being attempted  either by means of luring potential victims through prizes/gifts, or by using fake websites to  convince them to enter credential information99.  93  http://www.commtouch.com/uploads/2013/04/Commtouch-Internet-Threats-Trend-Report-2013-April.pdf, accessed 6  Nov 2013.  94  http://www.commtouch.com/uploads/pdf/Commtouch-Internet-Threats-Trend-Report-Q3-2013.pdf, accessed 7 Nov  2013.  95  http://www.f-secure.com/static/doc/labs_global/Research/Mobile_Threat_Report_Q1_2013.pdf, accessed 6 Nov 2013.  96  https://www.ibm.com/services/forms/signup.do?source=swg- WW_Security_Organic&S_PKG=ov16986&S_TACT=102PW63W, accessed 6 Nov 2013.  97  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigerian_scam, accessed 6 Nov 2013.  98  http://www.commtouch.com/uploads/2013/04/Commtouch-Internet-Threats-Trend-Report-2013-April.pdf, accessed 6  Nov 2013.  99  http://www.symantec.com/security_response/publications/threatreport.jsp, accessed 6 Nov 2013.  http://www.commtouch.com/uploads/2013/04/Commtouch-Internet-Threats-Trend-Report-2013-April.pdf http://www.commtouch.com/uploads/pdf/Commtouch-Internet-Threats-Trend-Report-Q3-2013.pdf http://www.f-secure.com/static/doc/labs_global/Research/Mobile_Threat_Report_Q1_2013.pdf https://www.ibm.com/services/forms/signup.do?source=swg-WW_Security_Organic&S_PKG=ov16986&S_TACT=102PW63W https://www.ibm.com/services/forms/signup.do?source=swg-WW_Security_Organic&S_PKG=ov16986&S_TACT=102PW63W http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigerian_scam http://www.commtouch.com/uploads/2013/04/Commtouch-Internet-Threats-Trend-Report-2013-April.pdf http://www.symantec.com/security_response/publications/threatreport.jsp  ENISA Threat Landscape 2013  Overview of current and emerging cyber-threats  11 December 2013  Page  27   It seems that spammers are checking regularly the capability/performance of existing spam  filters. In the reporting period we have seen spams that have obviously no malicious  background, have strange content and/or structure98,100.   The techniques of spammers evolve. For end users it is important to understand tricks101 and  have basic sensitivity/awareness on this matter.

Rogue security software, ransomware  and scareware are malicious pieces of software - distributed by threat agents - to terrify/blackmail  users, thus demanding ransom payments. Although a decline has been reported regarding the  number of fake Anti-Virus (AV) products in comparison to 2012, the overall numbers of  rogueware/ransomeare/Scareware remain high56,102,103. In particular, ransomware has reached high  levels of infection104. Despite recent law enforcement advances105, the reports analysed provide  strong evidence that there is an increase in ransomware threat104. One reason for the growth is the  expansion of ransomware and fake Antivirus distribution to mobile platforms, such as Android106.  Again, one significant component of the increase registered related to mobile platforms:  ransomware (i.e. FakeAV) has hit this year Android104,107,108.  In the reporting period we have assessed that:   The availability of anonymous payment services to channel illegal profits obtained from this  threat is a key enabler for this kind of fraud109.   Rogueware, ransomware and scareware are distributed via exploit kits, while exploiting Java and  Adobe vulnerabilities. The use of exploit kits (see also description of exploit kits threat above), is  100  http://www.spiegel.de/netzwelt/web/e-mail-provider-gmx-und-co-der-raetselhafte-buchstaben-spam-a-931933.html,  accessed 6 Nov 2013.  101  http://www.appriver.com/downloads/global-threatscape-reports/2013/GlobalThreatScapeReport_6MonthEdition.pdf,  accessed 6 Nov 2013.  102  http://www.kindsight.net/sites/default/files/Kindsight-Q2-2013-Malware-Report.pdf, accessed 6 Nov 2013.  103  http://www.itproportal.com/2013/04/10/ransomware-the-cybercrime-money-machine-of-2013/, accessed 19 Nov  2013.  104  https://www.us-cert.gov/ncas/alerts/TA13-309A, accessed 18 Nov 2013.  105  https://www.europol.europa.eu/content/police-dismantle-prolific-ransomware-cybercriminal-network, accessed 8  August 2013.  106  https://www.infoworld.com/t/mobile-security/ransomware-android-it-was-only-matter-of-time-221285, accessed 8  August 2013.  107  http://www.symantec.com/connect/blogs/fakeav-holds-android-phones-ransom, accessed 6 Nov 2013.  108  http://blog.fortinet.com/Ransomware/, accessed 6 Nov 2013.  109  http://www.mcafee.com/us/resources/reports/rp-quarterly-threat-q1-2013.pdf, accessed 8 August 2013.  http://www.spiegel.de/netzwelt/web/e-mail-provider-gmx-und-co-der-raetselhafte-buchstaben-spam-a-931933.html http://www.appriver.com/downloads/global-threatscape-reports/2013/GlobalThreatScapeReport_6MonthEdition.pdf http://www.kindsight.net/sites/default/files/Kindsight-Q2-2013-Malware-Report.pdf http://www.itproportal.com/2013/04/10/ransomware-the-cybercrime-money-machine-of-2013/ https://www.us-cert.gov/ncas/alerts/TA13-309A https://www.europol.europa.eu/content/police-dismantle-prolific-ransomware-cybercriminal-network https://www.infoworld.com/t/mobile-security/ransomware-android-it-was-only-matter-of-time-221285 http://www.symantec.com/connect/blogs/fakeav-holds-android-phones-ransom http://blog.fortinet.com/Ransomware/ http://www.mcafee.com/us/resources/reports/rp-quarterly-threat-q1-2013.pdf  ENISA Threat Landscape 2013  Overview of current and emerging cyber-threats  11 December 2013  Page  28  concluded from the wide spread and the existence of variations/derivates of this malware, that  is, alternations to some initial code performed by individual threat agents110 .   Just as it is the case with the rest of malware, the sophistication of ransomware increases111,112 .   In the reporting period a significant success of law enforcement led to arrest of members of  cyber-criminal gang responsible for the “Police Virus” (statement of the Spanish Ministry of  Interior113 ).

With this threat, we refer to loss  of data occurring via intentional or unintentional information disclosure (i.e. through mistakes in  managing information assets). This threat might originate from internal threat agents or external  ones. In both cases there might have both hostile116 and non-hostile intentions (i.e. lack of  knowledge or negligence). As regards intentional causes, this threat is rather a cumulative  implication of other threats mentioned in this report on data. The unintentional part of it, however,  is a threat that can materialize due to errors and mistakes of personnel. In all cases, data breaches  are systematically reported in related publications. Data breaches are related to incidents from  materialized threats, whereby information has been compromised. As such, data breach reporting is  considered to be an important indicator of the protection level for company data, but also the  effectiveness of malicious actions117. This information is useful for decision and policy makers,  especially from the economic point of view118.  In the reporting period we have assessed that:  110  http://press.pandasecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/PandaLabs-Quaterly-Report.pdf, accessed 6 Nov 2013.  111  http://news.techworld.com/security/3470388/ransomware-criminals-attack-smes-using-strong-file-encryption-eset- warns/, accessed 19 Nov 2013.  112  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CryptoLocker, accessed 2 Dec 2013.  113  http://www.lamoncloa.gob.es/ServiciosdePrensa/NotasPrensa/MIR/2013/130213policiainformatica.htm, accessed 6  Nov 2013.  114  http://pandalabs.pandasecurity.com/operation-ransom-police-virus-authors-arrested/ , accessed 6 Nov 2013.  115  http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=wBMyaOa4Xnw, accessed 6 Nov 2013.  116  For internal threat agent see also Employee in Figure 20.  117  http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/10/29/us-adobe-cyberattack-idUSBRE99S1DJ20131029, accessed 5 Nov 2013.  118  https://www4.symantec.com/mktginfo/whitepaper/053013_GL_NA_WP_Ponemon-2013-Cost-of-a-Data-Breach- Report_daiNA_cta72382.pdf, accessed 6 Nov 2013.  http://press.pandasecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/PandaLabs-Quaterly-Report.pdf http://news.techworld.com/security/3470388/ransomware-criminals-attack-smes-using-strong-file-encryption-eset-warns/ http://news.techworld.com/security/3470388/ransomware-criminals-attack-smes-using-strong-file-encryption-eset-warns/ http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CryptoLocker http://www.lamoncloa.gob.es/ServiciosdePrensa/NotasPrensa/MIR/2013/130213policiainformatica.htm http://pandalabs.pandasecurity.com/operation-ransom-police-virus-authors-arrested/ http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=wBMyaOa4Xnw http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/10/29/us-adobe-cyberattack-idUSBRE99S1DJ20131029 https://www4.symantec.com/mktginfo/whitepaper/053013_GL_NA_WP_Ponemon-2013-Cost-of-a-Data-Breach-Report_daiNA_cta72382.pdf https://www4.symantec.com/mktginfo/whitepaper/053013_GL_NA_WP_Ponemon-2013-Cost-of-a-Data-Breach-Report_daiNA_cta72382.pdf  ENISA Threat Landscape 2013  Overview of current and emerging cyber-threats  11 December 2013  Page  29   Small organisations are more targeted by malware aiming at financial fraud. Larger organisations  are targeted merely with the intention of espionage119. This might be indicative for the  quality/quantity of protection measures. Eventually, larger organisations are better off in  protecting themselves against more simple kinds of attacks, while they often become victims of  highly skilled organised crime.   As regards data breaches, internal actors are at the minority. The vast amount of data breaches  are attributed to external threat agents119. This is reflected in a study on the costs of data  breaches: malicious attacks are at the first position, while system failure and human factor score  second and third respectively118.   Data breach reporting is an important tool for the evaluation of effectiveness/maturity of  existing controls. Data breach notification mechanisms are envisaged from policy makers as an  instrument towards better cyber security governance120.   Through the deployment of simple/low cost security controls organisations may drastically  reduce data breaches: over 70% of incidents are based on simple/low difficulty attacks.   Most of misuse actions are caused by physical access, either directly or indirectly to the asset  targeted. LAN and remote access are following119.

This  threat is differentiated from data breaches, as it merely concerns technical or organisational  information that might be interesting for threat agents in order to perform reconnaissance and  delivery of their attacks; as opposed to data breach which is result of a successful attack targeting  customers’ data. In the reporting period aggressive adware collecting information has been  encountered121,122. Moreover, unsecured file transfers might lead to severe information leakage65, as  well as poor encryption practices for mobile devices.  119  http://www.verizonenterprise.com/resources/reports/rp_data-breach-investigations-report-2013_en_xg.pdf, accessed  5 Nov 2013.  120  http://www.computerweekly.com/news/2240203760/EU-data-breach-disclosures-to-be-enforced-soon, accessed 5  Nov 2013.  121  http://www.trendmicro.co.uk/cloud-content/us/pdfs/security-intelligence/reports/rpt-zero-days-hit-users-hard-at-the- start-of-the-year.pdf, accessed 8 Nov 2013.  122  https://blog.lookout.com/blog/2013/06/05/world-current-of-mobile-threats/, accessed 8 Nov 2013.  http://www.verizonenterprise.com/resources/reports/rp_data-breach-investigations-report-2013_en_xg.pdf http://www.computerweekly.com/news/2240203760/EU-data-breach-disclosures-to-be-enforced-soon http://www.trendmicro.co.uk/cloud-content/us/pdfs/security-intelligence/reports/rpt-zero-days-hit-users-hard-at-the-start-of-the-year.pdf http://www.trendmicro.co.uk/cloud-content/us/pdfs/security-intelligence/reports/rpt-zero-days-hit-users-hard-at-the-start-of-the-year.pdf https://blog.lookout.com/blog/2013/06/05/world-current-of-mobile-threats/  ENISA Threat Landscape 2013  Overview of current and emerging cyber-threats  11 December 2013  Page  30  In the reporting period we have assessed that:   Broken authentication and session management has the consequence that attackers may hijack  user sessions, gain user credentials and obtain access to business transactions. This is based on  leakage from bad session management123.   Directory traversal is a threat that has been already mentioned in code injection (see above).  Path manipulation124 and resource injection125 are attacks based on directory information  leakage.   Network reconnaissance126,127 is a known, yet very important information gaining method/attack  to obtain system, network and other resources. Network reconnaissance is based on leakage of  network structure and is an important part of targeted attacks. Besides networks, availability of  information on other resources may facilitate all kinds of attacks128.   Due to user negligence but also maturity level of available apps, big parts of mobile  communication take place unsecured, often over unsecured channels. This can lead to  significant information leakage including personal and business information65.   Research with support of social media can be a very effective way to obtain information on  human resources. Widely available services on the web129 allow for identification of further  personal details which, when combined with additional information may result in significant  knowledge about targeted individuals.   Although not explicitly a leakage issue, it is worth mentioning cloud services (e.g. cross VM side  channels) as a potential to abuse computing power, data concentration and extract sensitive  data130,131.

Targeted  attacks are further characterised by the capability level and dedication of the threat agent deploying  the attack: all of the (successful) attacks reported in 2013 have been performed by threat agents  with assumedly large resources132. Another important observation in the reporting period is a shift  of APT targets from financial institutions to politically motivated targets such as NGOs, governmental  organisations, politically active groups, etc133,134.  In the reporting period we have assessed that:   2013 has been characterised by numerous APT attakcs, whereas it has become clear that one  should not assume only a few rogue states as main originators of targeted attacks. There are  quite some nation states that have developed sufficient capabilities and infrastructure to  successfully launch targeted attacks that can be used to infiltrate all kinds of targets.   In 2013, targeted attacks demonstrated their true potential. In particular, cyber espionage  attacks using targeted attack campaigns reached dimensions that went far beyond  expectations135,136.   With recent advances in mobile threats such as malware, code injection, scam/spam, etc.,  mobile platforms have become an important attack surface for targeted attacks95,137. It is worth  mentioning that mobile spyware applications might become strong tools for APTs targeting Bring  Your Own Device environments138.   Targeted attacks are applied as a pressure instrument at multiple levels. Concrete examples in  the reporting period of successful attacks to notable social media accounts96,139 have shown the  potential towards the materialisation of risks similar to “Digital Wild Fires in a Hyper-connected  World”140.   Sophistication, complexity and stealthiness of targeted attacks are state-of-the-art in cyber-  attack techniques141. Prevention from such attacks is a complex task that has to embrace all  levels of organisational assets, from technology to processes to people. The defence has to be  prepared and implemented as orchestrated as the attack itself.

When visiting a manipulated web site,  devices of members of the target group get eventually infected142.  Although already mentioned in 2012, in the reporting period this threat has significantly increased  and led to several successful attacks targeting high tech companies143,144, but also governmental  organisations 145 . Though relatively low in number, these attacks have demonstrated the  effectiveness of this threat as it has hit companies who are at the leading edge of technology. Hence,  it is alarming that when targeting lower tech users, such attacks will be at least equally successful!  This has created a lot of awareness in the threat analysts’ community47, especially due to the fact  that such attacks are usually launched within more extensive targeted attacks.  In the reporting period we have assessed that:   Information about surfing habits are tracked via tracking services as the ones used by marketing  companies to collect data. By tracking users of a specific company, it is possible to find web sites  that are frequently used by groups of people. Obviously, these web sites are the best candidates  to infect146.   Watering hole attacks have some commonalities with search engine poisoning (SEP): attracting  potential victims to visit an infected web site based on their interests. However, watering hole  attacks are more effective especially when attackers want to focus to a specific user group.   It is worth mentioning that watering hole attacks are more a method to downsize the effort of  threat agents while being more successful: fewer web site infections do more effectively reach  target victim group. Otherwise, the methods used for victim infection are the ones mentioned  above (drive-by downloads, exploit kits, malware).   It is expected that deployments of this type of threat will increase in the future147. It might be  meaningful if owners of infected web sites inform their visitors. At the end, every web site is a  “water hole” of some user group.

Firstly, it should be mentioned that in 2013 more elaborated/qualitative descriptions have  been found on this topic148,149. Moreover, through relevant publications150,151,152,153,154 details about  incidents and potential attacks caused by each particular threat agent group have been published.  All in all, in comparison to 2013 a better and more concise coverage of threat agents in the causal  chain of attacks has been assessed. This is definitely an advancement compared to 2012.  The above developments support a better description of threat agents, including profiles, motives  capabilities, etc. While the threat agents from ETL 2012 still remain relevant, the details assessed  this year provide the basis for a more elaborated description. In addition, two new threat agents  groups have been added, script kiddies and cyber fighters.  In particular, the major threat agents identified are as follows:  Corporations: The objective of corporations is mainly the creation of competitive advantages.  Hence, corporations may act as hostile threat agents when involved in activities to: collect business  intelligence, to breach intellectual property rights, to gather confidential information on  competitors, to be engaged in intelligence gathering connected to bids, etc. Generally speaking,  corporations may be involved in reconnaissance activities, intrusion and data breach. Corporations  may engage salaried threat agents from other groups to achieve their objectives. Depending on their  size, sector and level of engagement in high-tech areas and secrecy levels corporations may possess  significant cyber capabilities to perform malicious activities towards achieving their objectives. In  such cases, corporations may use sophisticated targeted attacks to infiltrate their victims.  Nation States: 2013 has clearly unveiled the true dimension behind the potential of this threat agent  group. In the reporting period it has become clear, that cyber activities are not a matter of one-two  nation states. Rather, multiple nation states have developed capabilities that can be used to  infiltrate all kinds of targets both governmental and private in order to achieve their objectives. Main  targets of this threat agent group are state secrets, military secrets, data on intelligence, as well as  threatening the availability of critical infrastructures. Acting with a high level of capabilities, the  methods/vectors of launched attacks vary significantly. Yet, high effort and high sophistication  targeted attacks belong to the main attack methods used. The degree of successfulness of  performed attacks can be considered as rather high.  Hacktivists: Hacktivists is a threat agent group that has enjoyed great media attention, particularly in  2011155 and to some extend 2012. Hacktivists are ideologically motivated individuals that can  dynamically form groups/subgroups, usually lacking a central organisation structure. Their main  148  https://www.ncsc.nl/english/current-topics/news/cyber-security-assesment-netherlands.html, accessed 30 Oct 2013.  149  http://www.ark-group.com/Downloads/Cybercrime-Threats-and-Solutions-Sample1.pdf, accessed 16 Oct 2013.  150  http://www.freedomfromfearmagazine.org/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=302:hackers-profiling- who-are-the-attackers&catid=50:issue-7&Itemid=187, accessed 16 Oct 2013.  151  http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/apr/29/hacking-guardian-syria-background, accessed 16 Oct 2013.  152  http://www.verizonenterprise.com/DBIR/2013/, accessed 16 Oct 2013.  153  http://owasptop10.googlecode.com/files/OWASP%20Top%2010%20-%202013.pdf, accessed 16 Oct 2013.  154  http://www.kpmg.com/Global/en/IssuesAndInsights/ArticlesPublications/global-profiles-of-the- fraudster/Documents/global-profiles-of-the-fraudster-v2.pdf, accessed 2 Dec 2013.  155  http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2011/12/2011-hactivist-verizon/, accessed 30 Oct 2013.  https://www.ncsc.nl/english/current-topics/news/cyber-security-assesment-netherlands.html http://www.ark-group.com/Downloads/Cybercrime-Threats-and-Solutions-Sample1.pdf http://www.freedomfromfearmagazine.org/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=302:hackers-profiling-who-are-the-attackers&catid=50:issue-7&Itemid=187 http://www.freedomfromfearmagazine.org/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=302:hackers-profiling-who-are-the-attackers&catid=50:issue-7&Itemid=187 http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/apr/29/hacking-guardian-syria-background http://www.verizonenterprise.com/DBIR/2013/ http://owasptop10.googlecode.com/files/OWASP%20Top%2010%20-%202013.pdf http://www.kpmg.com/Global/en/IssuesAndInsights/ArticlesPublications/global-profiles-of-the-fraudster/Documents/global-profiles-of-the-fraudster-v2.pdf http://www.kpmg.com/Global/en/IssuesAndInsights/ArticlesPublications/global-profiles-of-the-fraudster/Documents/global-profiles-of-the-fraudster-v2.pdf http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2011/12/2011-hactivist-verizon/  ENISA Threat Landscape 2013  Overview of current and emerging cyber-threats  11 December 2013  Page  37  motivation is usually the defence of ideas that are sometime manifested148. Due to the dynamics  behind this group, it is difficult to shape a sharp profile for this group: in some cases, threat agents of  other groups – e.g. script kiddies - join hacktivists activities in order to co-protest or to serve other  purposes (e.g. express their sympathy, perform knowledge transfer, provide tools, etc.). Targets of  hacktivists are selected in such a way, that media attention to successful cyber-attacks create high  visibility (e.g. government sites, big companies, media, public and private infrastructure  components, etc.). It is common that breached data are published to embarrass victims and achieve  desired public attention. Although not considered to possess average capabilities, due to group  dynamics and media visibility, hacktivists may achieve severe impact.  Cyber Terrorists: yet controversially discussed, this group is mainly used to attribute potential  threats to cyber-targets that will harm national security and society156. As a matter of fact, only  minor incidents have been documented. Officials speak about some attacks that are being kept  confidential157. Characteristic of this threat agent group is the indiscriminate use of violence in order  to influence decisions/actions of states towards their politically or relationally motivated objectives.  Activities of this threat group are mostly impact oriented and may affect or harm large parts of  society, just to generate necessary pressure. Cyber terrorists may use technology both as the means  and target of their attacks, while critical infrastructures comprise one of the main targets158. Further  targets of this group may be traffic control, military infrastructures159, government systems, etc.  Information collection, reconnaissance and social engineering are methods that may belong to the  key capabilities of this group, while access to high tech tools and methods are also considered within  their capabilities, especially due to blurring lines between this and other threat agent groups160.  Cybercriminals: This threat agent group is the most widely known as its objective is to obtain profit  from illegal/criminal activities in the cyberspace. Cybercriminals act mainly in the cyberspace and so  do their victims. Hence, cybercriminals are involved in fraud regarding all kinds of e-finance, e- commerce, e-payment, ransomware, cybercrime-as-a-service, delivery and development of  malicious tools and infrastructures. It should be noted, that in this group we do not consider  individuals involved in a “traditional” crime using IT to facilitate their criminal activity.  Cybercriminals have high capabilities in performing their tasks, can be globally interconnected161 and  may easily obtain access to the means needed for their hostile activities. By taking as given that this  group possesses significant monetary resources, it should be considered as being in the position to  occupy additional workforce in order to enhance capabilities162.  Although essentially belonging to the group of cybercriminals group, we discriminate between users  and providers/developers/operators of malware, botnets and other kinds of malicious cyber-tools.  It is considered that those who develop, deliver and operate malicious infrastructures are the most  skilled among all cyber threat agents and as such they have the highest cyber striking power from all  other threat agent groups considered. Nevertheless, one can assume that they mainly provide the  means for attacks (i.e. services/tools) to other cybercriminals and they may not be actively involved  in fraudulent activities.  156  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyberterrorism, accessed 3 Dec 2013.  157  http://www.psmag.com/politics/nsa-really-stopping-terrorist-plots-70159/, accessed 3 Dec 2013.  158  http://www.timesofisrael.com/internet-cable-cutters-caught-by-egypt-signal-new-terror-threat/, accessed 16 Oct 2013  159  http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2013/09/04/world/al-qaida-hopes-to-sabotage-destroy-drones/, accessed 16 Oct  2013  160  http://cryptome.org/2013/04/terrorist-hackers.htm, accessed 16 Oct 2013  161  http://www.f-secure.com/static/doc/labs_global/Research/Threat_Report_H1_2013.pdf, accessed 16 Oct 2013.  162  http://www.smh.com.au/technology/technology-news/silk-road-mastermind-ross-william-ulbricht-tripped-up-by- careless-online-mistake-20131003-2utky.html, accessed 16 Oct 2013.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyberterrorism http://www.psmag.com/politics/nsa-really-stopping-terrorist-plots-70159/ http://www.timesofisrael.com/internet-cable-cutters-caught-by-egypt-signal-new-terror-threat/ http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2013/09/04/world/al-qaida-hopes-to-sabotage-destroy-drones/ http://cryptome.org/2013/04/terrorist-hackers.htm http://www.f-secure.com/static/doc/labs_global/Research/Threat_Report_H1_2013.pdf http://www.smh.com.au/technology/technology-news/silk-road-mastermind-ross-william-ulbricht-tripped-up-by-careless-online-mistake-20131003-2utky.html http://www.smh.com.au/technology/technology-news/silk-road-mastermind-ross-william-ulbricht-tripped-up-by-careless-online-mistake-20131003-2utky.html  ENISA Threat Landscape 2013  Overview of current and emerging cyber-threats  11 December 2013  Page  38  Cyber Fighters: Cyber fighters are groups of nationally motivated citizens. This is an emerging  phenomenon where patriotic motivated groups of citizens bear the potential to launch cyber-attacks  in a coordinated manner163. Such groups might have strong feelings when their political, national or  religious values seem to be threatened by another group and are capable of launching cyber- attacks164. One can argue that such groups are special cases of Hacktivism (i.e. an evolution or yet  another instance). To certain extent, such groups may be supporters of totalitarian regimes and,  rightly or wrongly, act on behalf of their supporting parties (i.e. governments) by contributing to  national activities in the cyber-space165. Their activities may include conflicts with other groups (i.e.  other hacktivists). Depending on their number and capabilities, such groups may form a considerable  striking power. They can be considered as underground cyber fighters in support of the interests of a  nation state166.  Script Kiddies: “As more young people learn to code, more will learn to hack”167. This statement  indicates the birth site of hackers. This is when young individuals get thrilled about achievements  and skills of tech savvy individuals who assumedly gave a lesson to persons, organisations or brands  considered outrageous. Despite being in a self-discovery phase and technically novice, due to their  large number, script kiddies are susceptive to external influences from other threat agent groups, in  particular cyber criminals and hacktivists. On the other hand, due to reduced knowledge about both  the use of hacking tools and the consequences of their activities, script kiddies may achieve great  impact. Typically this threat agent group is engaged in DDoS and code injection attacks149. Script  kiddies may also form ad-hoc groups with common targets and develop to a considerable striking  power168.  Online Social Hackers: there is an increasing significance of social engineering as element of cyber- attack pattern169. Therefore this threat agent group plays a key role when deploying cyber threats.  These online social hackers are skilled with social engineering knowledge, are in the position to  analyse and understand behaviour and psychology of social targets and to generate false trust  relationships. Even if not necessarily using high-tech methodologies and tools, activities of this  threat agent group may cause significant impact especially in areas of identity theft, collection of  confidential personal data, user credentials, cyber bullying, etc170. The capabilities of this group can  be characterised as low to medium as regards the use of technology. However their social  engineering skills might be quite high. With increasing use of social networking, it is expected that  the importance of this group in cyber-attacks will grow in the future.  Employees: this group is the one behind the insider threat that often scores within the top 10 cyber  threats171,172. This threat agent group (or also widely referred to as “internal actors”148), can be staff,  contractors, operational staff, former employees, etc. The reasons for acting within threat agent  group may vary significantly, i.e. lax handling of security procedures, user error or even malicious  intent. This threat group is usually equipped with low to medium-tech methods and tools. However,  due to graded access rights to all kinds of assets of an organisation, they might cause significant  163  http://krebsonsecurity.com/2013/06/iranian-elections-bring-lull-in-bank-attacks/, accessed 29 Nov 2013.  164  http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2313652/AP-Twitter-hackers-break-news-White-House-explosions-injured- Obama.html, accessed 16 Oct 2013.  165  http://www.mcafee.com/us/resources/white-papers/wp-hacktivism.pdf, accessed 16 Oct 2013.  166  http://mashable.com/2012/08/10/syrian-electronic-army/, accessed 16 Oct 2013.  167  http://www.fastcolabs.com/3013102/why-the-script-kiddie-next-door-is-just-as-dangerous-as-a-chinese-government- hacker, accessed 16 Oct 2013.  168  http://www.cnhinews.com/wpbloom/x862178305/Teens-hone-hacking-skills-in-contests, accessed 16 Oct 2013  169  http://public.tableausoftware.com/views/VERISCommunity/SummaryofActions#1, accessed 16 Oct 2013.  170  http://resources.infosecinstitute.com/social-engineering-a-hacking-story/, accessed 16 Oct 2013.  171  https://cloudsecurityalliance.org/research/top-threats/, accessed 16 Oct 2013.  172  http://www.red-book.eu/, accessed 16 Oct 2013.  http://krebsonsecurity.com/2013/06/iranian-elections-bring-lull-in-bank-attacks/ http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2313652/AP-Twitter-hackers-break-news-White-House-explosions-injured-Obama.html http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2313652/AP-Twitter-hackers-break-news-White-House-explosions-injured-Obama.html http://www.mcafee.com/us/resources/white-papers/wp-hacktivism.pdf http://mashable.com/2012/08/10/syrian-electronic-army/ http://www.fastcolabs.com/3013102/why-the-script-kiddie-next-door-is-just-as-dangerous-as-a-chinese-government-hacker http://www.fastcolabs.com/3013102/why-the-script-kiddie-next-door-is-just-as-dangerous-as-a-chinese-government-hacker http://www.cnhinews.com/wpbloom/x862178305/Teens-hone-hacking-skills-in-contests http://public.tableausoftware.com/views/VERISCommunity/SummaryofActions#1 http://resources.infosecinstitute.com/social-engineering-a-hacking-story/ https://cloudsecurityalliance.org/research/top-threats/ http://www.red-book.eu/  ENISA Threat Landscape 2013  Overview of current and emerging cyber-threats  11 December 2013  Page  39  damage, especially when having malicious intent. Dissatisfaction, frustration, dissent or corruption  are common causes behind malicious behaviour of this threat agent group.  The above mentioned threat agents are a consolidated form of the significant ones mentioned in  relevant publications. Yet the list is not exhaustive: depending on particular incidents, viewpoints  and scope, additional groups are being considered. Besides this fact, and given the often blurry lines  between legitimate cyber agents and hostile ones, cases where “camp changes” take place have  been reported. In other words, bad guys might be engaged within state or company sponsored  efforts173 and good guys may serve hostile tasks174.  In order to give an overview of existing agents/actors acting in cyber space - both hostile and friendly  - a taxonomy of cyber agents has been developed (see Figure 20). It should be noted, that the threat  agents mentioned in this chapter are depicted in the figure through the right hand branch,  annotated as Hostile Cyber Agent, whereas the left hand branch of it stays for other agents who  serve friendly tasks in cyber space.  The purpose of this figure is to deliver information on agents/actors acting in cyber space such as  motive, capability or areas of engagement. Furthermore, this figure may be used in order to  follow/comprehend eventual interactions among the different groups, such as possible “camp  changes”, concurrent roles or other interactions among them. Drawing these kinds of possible  interdependencies on demand, may facilitate the work of security experts willing to understand  possible interactions among these groups and thus better assess the capabilities behind asserted  threat agents.

The purpose of this table is to visualize which threat  agent groups use which threats. The target group of this information are individuals who wish to  assess possible threat agent involvement in the deployment of threats. This information might be  useful when assessing which capability level can be assumed behind the top threats and thus  support in decisions concerning the strength of the implemented security measures.  As already stated, overlaps among the threat agent groups do exist. This is reflected in the table by  eventual similarities in the way of threat deployment.

The content  of this chapter constitutes the Emerging Threat Landscape. The information presented has been  assessed by the analysis of relevant material. Both threat trends and emerging technology areas  have been either directly mentioned or have been implicitly assessed from the analysed material.  Threat trend identification by means of emerging technology areas is an approach that has also been  followed in ETL 2012. It aims at establishing the context between threats and various technology  areas that will undergo significant development in the near future (i.e. coming year). By mapping  threats to emerging developments, future/emerging trends within the threat landscape are being  captured.  Within ETL 2013, all of the areas addressed in 2012 have been maintained, as they still represent the  state-of-the-art in IT technology development. As such they are of paramount importance for a large  group of stakeholders from both public and private sectors. Last year’s list has been expanded with  one “newcomer”, the Internet of Things. Whilst it is not a new area in cyber-security, this area is  considered by analysts as an innovative field that has reached a maturity enabling its entrance to the  market.  It is worth mentioning, that in the reporting period ENISA has performed specific/detailed  assessments in the areas of Critical Infrastructures and Trust Infrastructures; assessments regarding  threat and risk exposure of smart grids and the use of e-ID in financial sector have been performed  and are going to be available as autonomous ENISA deliverables. The presented information  regarding these two areas is a summary of the work conducted in these ENISA projects.  In particular, the emerging technology areas considered are:   Critical Infrastructures: Critical infrastructures are a vital part of society and national sovereignty.  The security of critical infrastructure will remain high priority for governments and big operators.   Mobile Computing: Besides cloud computing and Internet of Things, mobile computing is  another major trend that has changed traditional IT architecture. Mobile computing has made  digital convergence to reality and has caused a revolution in application development. This area  it is going to continue being a platform for innovations.   Social Networking: The paradigm of interconnected individuals, professionals and knowledge is  one of the major social phenomena of recent years. Social media have already penetrated the  lives of a significant part of online users. This development is going to continue for the years to  come.   Cloud Computing: Cloud computing is an integral counterpart of the current internet  architecture. Besides storage, it increasingly accommodates application services by thus  innovating commercial IT operations. Cloud computing also embraces the promise of a more  effective implementation of security mechanisms by leveraging on economies of scale.   Trust Infrastructure: Trust infrastructures and authentication infrastructure in particular is the  spine of cyber-security. Attacks, but also technology and implementation issues hereof are  important elements of every cyber-security assessment. It is expected that this area will retain  its central role for the future.   Big Data: The role of big data for security has worried security professionals for quite some time  now. In the reporting period, big data has been the subject of vivid discussions after revelations  on industrial espionage and state sponsored surveillance activities. Through the proliferation of  mobile and smart devices, big data is going to be for quite some time in the future on the focus  of cyber-security professionals and cyber-criminals alike.   Interconnected Devices – Internet of Things: Inter- and hyper-connected devices form the future  of internet: the Internet of Things. Low cost devices form an interconnected community to  ENISA Threat Landscape 2013  Overview of current and emerging cyber-threats  11 December 2013  Page  43  provide smart consumer services in many areas, such as smart houses, e-health, industrial  control systems, energy, cars, transportation, etc. Alike the other areas, the Internet of Things  will be the main source of technological innovations and challenges in the years to come.  It is obvious that these areas are not completely independent or overlap free. Developments in one  area may include aspects of others (i.e. technology, components, functions). However, splitting  threat trends according to those areas allows for a better establishment of the context of each  threat and helps assessing and understanding trends.  In the following sections a short discussion with the highlights of each particular area is given prior  to the emerging threat and trends assessed. In addition to the emerging threats, for each area we  provide a number of important issues regarding developments/challenges in cyber-security that are  seen as relevant for the particular area. Just as in the current threat landscape, the sequence of  presentation of the emerging threats is a prediction of the overall frequency of the threat  materialization (i.e. more frequent threats appear first). For each area, the top 10 threats have been  assessed, expect in the area of Internet of Things, where only 9 emerging threats were identified.  When applicable, references to resources indicate the sources used for the assessment. These  sources can be used by interested readers in order to find more extensive information about the  corresponding topic. In the following discussions, trends issued in the reporting period have been  accommodated176,177.  5.1 Threat Trends in Critical Infrastructures  This area is key for society and national security. Critical Infrastructure and their main components  Industrial Control Systems (ICS) have and are still considered as main potential targets of highly  capable threat agent groups, namely terrorists and nation states. Due to their complexity, critical  infrastructures are complex systems and so is their protection. One can take as given that availability  of critical infrastructure is the most important property to maintain. This sheds the right light to the  exposure but also the difficulty of protection of such infrastructures. Finally, critical infrastructures  and ICSs are considered within strategic priorities for cyber-security by various actors178,179,180.  In the reporting period, ENISA has delivered a dedicated threat landscape in the area of smart grids.  As a matter of fact, smart grids are an ideal representative in the area of critical infrastructures:  being a very complex system combining both legacy and innovative systems; and playing a key role  for energy distribution in the years to come. As in many complex systems, smart grids consist of a  variety of components ranging from high end monitoring and control systems up to low cost end- user devices. These systems grow gradually by using a variety of communication protocols,  applications and devices all being at a different maturity level both from the technology and security  utilization point of view. Hence, the main cause of threat exposure in this area emerges from the  technological diversity, component integration, coordination level and cyber security preparedness  176  For a comprehensive summary of issues trends please visit: http://www.zdnet.com/cybersecurity-in-2014-a-roundup- of-predictions-7000023729/, accessed 3 December 2013.  177  https://www.bsi.bund.de/SharedDocs/Downloads/DE/BSI/Publikationen/Lageberichte/Fokus_IT- Sicherheit_2013_nbf.pdf;jsessionid=9CFAC1176CDDA96ACA5DB0EF7AA77882.2_cid359?__blob=publicationFile,  accessed 3 December 2013.  178  http://www.red-book.eu/, accessed 20 Nov 2013.  179  http://www.gtsecuritysummit.com/2014Report.pdf, accessed 20 Nov 2013.  180  https://www.ncsc.nl/binaries/en/current-topics/news/cyber-security-assesment- netherlands/1/Cyber%2BSecurity%2BAssessment%2BNetherlands.pdf, accessed 20 Nov 2013.  http://www.zdnet.com/cybersecurity-in-2014-a-roundup-of-predictions-7000023729/ http://www.zdnet.com/cybersecurity-in-2014-a-roundup-of-predictions-7000023729/ https://www.bsi.bund.de/SharedDocs/Downloads/DE/BSI/Publikationen/Lageberichte/Fokus_IT-Sicherheit_2013_nbf.pdf;jsessionid=9CFAC1176CDDA96ACA5DB0EF7AA77882.2_cid359?__blob=publicationFile https://www.bsi.bund.de/SharedDocs/Downloads/DE/BSI/Publikationen/Lageberichte/Fokus_IT-Sicherheit_2013_nbf.pdf;jsessionid=9CFAC1176CDDA96ACA5DB0EF7AA77882.2_cid359?__blob=publicationFile http://www.red-book.eu/ http://www.gtsecuritysummit.com/2014Report.pdf https://www.ncsc.nl/binaries/en/current-topics/news/cyber-security-assesment-netherlands/1/Cyber%2BSecurity%2BAssessment%2BNetherlands.pdf https://www.ncsc.nl/binaries/en/current-topics/news/cyber-security-assesment-netherlands/1/Cyber%2BSecurity%2BAssessment%2BNetherlands.pdf  ENISA Threat Landscape 2013  Overview of current and emerging cyber-threats  11 December 2013  Page  44  of the actors involved in the supply chain. Known incidents in the reporting period show that the  energy grid is one of the main targets of cyber-criminals181.

Besides this kind of vulnerabilities, it seems that there is a lack of  available information vulnerabilities related to CII infrastructures, scenarios and components. It  is expected that in the near future capabilities for building up and testing of such scenarios will  be developed182.   Words matter: it is important to develop and maintain terms and definitions. Besides serving as  a basis for experts, such a vocabulary would be necessary in the area of crisis management  regarding smart gird, but also other areas of CIIP: it emerges from the necessity to bridge  engineering and cyber security terms183,184.   It seems to be very important to elaborate on overlapping issues of safety, physical security vs.  cyber security. CIIP is a traditional engineering area in which safety standards and physical  security requirements are mandatorily implemented. Cyber security overlaps with safety and  181  http://www.csmonitor.com/Environment/2013/0227/Exclusive-Cyberattack-leaves-natural-gas-pipelines-vulnerable-to- sabotage, accessed 20 Nov 2013.  182  http://www.tecnalia.com/, accessed 21 Nov 2013.  183  http://cip.gmu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/October-2013_Financial-Services.pdf, accessed 21 Nov 2013.  184  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/critical-infrastructure-and-services/smart-grids-and-smart- metering/appropriate-security-measures-for-smart-grids/at_download/fullReport, accessed 21 Nov 2013.  http://www.csmonitor.com/Environment/2013/0227/Exclusive-Cyberattack-leaves-natural-gas-pipelines-vulnerable-to-sabotage http://www.csmonitor.com/Environment/2013/0227/Exclusive-Cyberattack-leaves-natural-gas-pipelines-vulnerable-to-sabotage http://www.tecnalia.com/ http://cip.gmu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/October-2013_Financial-Services.pdf https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/critical-infrastructure-and-services/smart-grids-and-smart-metering/appropriate-security-measures-for-smart-grids/at_download/fullReport https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/critical-infrastructure-and-services/smart-grids-and-smart-metering/appropriate-security-measures-for-smart-grids/at_download/fullReport  ENISA Threat Landscape 2013  Overview of current and emerging cyber-threats  11 December 2013  Page  45  physical security as it concerns the operational parts of CIIs. These overlaps need to be identified  and interfaces need to be established185.   Like any complex infrastructure used for large amounts of users/customers, the energy grid will  generate large amounts of data. This data will reflect, among other things, customer behaviour  regarding energy consumption. This massive information is a valuable asset for many  organisations and actors. It is expected that this information might be subject of data breaches,  manipulation, and fraud186.   Due to the inherent openness of the grid infrastructure, security measures based on detection of  intrusion/misuse will be necessary. Such measures will be developed around data exchanged  information. In particular, anomaly detection seems to be a very promising method to data  manipulation, fraud and targeted attacks187.   Due to the need of intensive investments in smart grid infrastructures, it is likely that security  will be developed on the basis of scenarios188;189. This is the next logical step from current  practices based on requirements190 and will be part of activities regarding the definition of  security architectures for smart grids in the coming year.  5.2 Threat Trends in Mobile Computing  As it can be easily foreseen, mobile computing will remain the prevailing platform for end-user  interaction and online activities. Being the perfect media convergence platform, mobile devices will  continue to be first choice for all kinds of users. But mobile computing goes beyond end-user  devices: mobile sensors, wirelessly interconnected components of intelligent environments, mobile  security devices, etc. are taking an important position within the mobile ecosystem that is currently  under significant development. Together with various infrastructure components and development  capabilities, this ecosystem becomes an inherent part of the internet architecture and services.  The current trend of “migration” of all kinds of malicious methods and tools into this ecosystem will  be continued in future179. But besides moving their attention to mobile computing, adversaries will  invest a lot of energy in identifying vulnerabilities in the mobile ecosystem: this is a new challenge,  as due to changes in user interaction and architecture models, new kinds of vulnerabilities will be  discovered and exploited.  Top emerging threats to mobile computing are:  Emerging Threat Threat Trend  1. Worms/Trojans (in particular performing man-in-the-mobile239  attacks).    2.

These shortcomings provide an attack  surface that will be exploited by adversaries.   The mobile ecosystem has introduced a change in existing protection strategies of organisations.  The fact that insecure devices enter into the company network makes them attractive to threat  agents as a steppingstone to the corporate environment.   New attack patterns presented recently have given an impression of possible malicious activities  involving mobile devices195. If seen in combination with the availability of low cost miniaturized  hardware196,197, one can expect that in short to middle term more and more attack vectors  attacking mobile devices will emerge.   The mobile ecosystem is one of the most significant “contributors” to big data. Apart from the  risk that this data is available to developers, operators and wireless providers without user  consent, it can also be easily manipulated198. Yet, it is a fact that the implications of this  exposure to end-users are not yet fully understood179.  191  http://threatpost.com/remote-code-injection-vulnerabilities-discovered-in-ios-apps, accessed 22 Nov 2013.  192  http://www.theregister.co.uk/2013/09/06/android_malware_spotting_hitching_a_ride_on_mobile_botnet/, accessed  22 Nov 2013.  193  http://www.tgdaily.com/mobility-brief/73765-apple-stores-malware-problem-exposed-by-researchers, accessed 22  Nov 2013.  194  http://threatpost.com/using-kernel-exploits-bypass-sandboxes-fun-and-profit-031813, accessed 27 Nov 2013.  195  http://hackaday.com/2013/08/01/blackhat-ios-device-charger-exploit-installs-and-activates-malware/, accessed 22 Nov  2013.  196  http://www.raspberrypi.org/, accessed 22 Nov 2013.  197  http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-24539417, accessed 22 Nov 2013.  198  https://mocana.com/blog/2013/03/26/manipulating-real-time-android-based-traffic-data-at-black-hat-europe/,  accessed 22 Nov 2013.  http://threatpost.com/remote-code-injection-vulnerabilities-discovered-in-ios-apps http://www.theregister.co.uk/2013/09/06/android_malware_spotting_hitching_a_ride_on_mobile_botnet/ http://www.tgdaily.com/mobility-brief/73765-apple-stores-malware-problem-exposed-by-researchers http://threatpost.com/using-kernel-exploits-bypass-sandboxes-fun-and-profit-031813 http://hackaday.com/2013/08/01/blackhat-ios-device-charger-exploit-installs-and-activates-malware/ http://www.raspberrypi.org/ http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-24539417 https://mocana.com/blog/2013/03/26/manipulating-real-time-android-based-traffic-data-at-black-hat-europe/  ENISA Threat Landscape 2013  Overview of current and emerging cyber-threats  11 December 2013  Page  47   Last but not least, mobile devices are a main source for information leakage threats. Seen in  combination with the vast amount of data that are available through the utilization of mobile  devices (e.g. geo-location, media behaviour, etc.), the potential of this information becomes  evident. Currently, mobile operators investigate business opportunities based on this data199. All  this indicates that the attractiveness of mobile will grow further, also for adversaries.  5.3 Threat Trends in Social Networks  In the reporting period social online activities have continued to increase and go mobile200. In  addition to this trend, more and more activities regarding leisure, education and professional life are  performed over social media. As result, this technology becomes the main channel for  communication, collection of knowledge201, dissemination of information, marketing.  During 2013 it has also become clear, that information from social media is just a part of the  information available online about behaviour and habits of users. Other sources are blogs, mails,  web activities, phone calls, etc. When all this data is combined via mining tools, large amount of  details about people’s lives can be assessed202, with young generation being the main group that is  digitally omnipresent178. It is evident that available social networking data are extremely interesting  for both good and bad. In the reporting period we have seen representative examples of misuse of  social media, such as misinformation, fake news, identity theft, fake social accounts etc203. These  cases are the evidence that social media have become a regular fixture in hacking business.  Top emerging threats to social networks are:  Emerging Threat Threat Trend  1.

As a consequence, misinformation propagation speed exceeds that of  serious journalism. Social media spread context free content. The relevance and authenticity of  spread information cannot be easily checked. This is a risk for society212, as misinformation can  be used with political, cultural, censorship or propaganda objectives in mind.   An important question for users for social networking systems will be how to balance their  privacy and security with benefits gained by using applications processing their location data,  personal preferences and habits. While some will look for anonymity based solutions, others  might scrutinise their digital presence. It is expected that anonymity technologies will be  developed and that the discussion about digital rights and “right to be forgotten”213,214 will be  refuelled.   Information found in big data can lead to a virtual growth of knowledge about social networking:  it includes information about visited sites, performed searches, collaboration, phone calls, blogs,  calendars, contact lists, etc178. This network of interconnections can be easily modelled and  constructed. It encompasses much more than friends and likes: it is a reflection of human live in  the digital space. Besides using this data for good, adversaries will keep trying to misuse this  information.   Human engineering attacks through online social hackers will continue keeping the cyber  security community busy. Social hacking will remain an important channel for malware, phishing,  208  http://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/blackhole-exploit-kit-spam-campaign-hits-pinterest/,  accessed 25 Nov 2013.  209  http://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/malware-hijacks-social-media-accounts-via-browser-add- ons/, accessed 25 Nov 2013.  210  http://arstechnica.com/security/2013/02/facebook-computers-compromised-by-zero-day-java-exploit/, accessed 25  Nov 2013.  211  http://www.computerworlduk.com/news/security/3443498/botnets-target-social-networks-with-spam/?olo=rss,  accessed 25 Nov 2013.  212  http://www.weforum.org/reports/global-risks-2013-eighth-edition, accessed 25 Nov 2013.  213  http://www.nationalsecuritylawbrief.com/the-right-to-be-forgotten-in-a-digital-age/, accessed 25 Nov 2013.  214 http://www.mondaq.com/x/274428/data+protection/Court+Ruling+Reinforces+The+Right+To+Be+Forgotten+On+Social +Media+Sites, accessed 25 Nov 2013.  http://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/blackhole-exploit-kit-spam-campaign-hits-pinterest/ http://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/malware-hijacks-social-media-accounts-via-browser-add-ons/ http://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/malware-hijacks-social-media-accounts-via-browser-add-ons/ http://arstechnica.com/security/2013/02/facebook-computers-compromised-by-zero-day-java-exploit/ http://www.computerworlduk.com/news/security/3443498/botnets-target-social-networks-with-spam/?olo=rss http://www.weforum.org/reports/global-risks-2013-eighth-edition http://www.nationalsecuritylawbrief.com/the-right-to-be-forgotten-in-a-digital-age/ http://www.mondaq.com/x/274428/data+protection/Court+Ruling+Reinforces+The+Right+To+Be+Forgotten+On+Social+Media+Sites http://www.mondaq.com/x/274428/data+protection/Court+Ruling+Reinforces+The+Right+To+Be+Forgotten+On+Social+Media+Sites  ENISA Threat Landscape 2013  Overview of current and emerging cyber-threats  11 December 2013  Page  49  spamming and identity theft attacks215. Despite awareness, well-crafted social media attacks will  show high success rates, especially when additional information (see section on big data and  Internet of Things) is being used to round up the attack.   Social forensics is an interesting area that analyses user behaviour from various information  sources providing evidence about interactions, trust level of connections, exchanged messages,  etc. Beyond using this tools/technology for law enforcement reasons, such tools might be used  to unveil social “robots”, that is, social profiles that have been created with nefarious objectives  in mind178,216.  5.4 Threat Trends in Cloud Computing  Cloud computing is becoming an integral part of the business IT ecosystem: company services and  data may be hosted in cloud servers, while at the same time end-users maintain theirown cloud  (storage) services to increase effectiveness and convenience. Mostly, business data in the cloud are  protected only via security mechanisms provided by the cloud environment. Taking as given that  business data are stored in multiple cloud environments (e.g. through business users using could  storage on their mobile devices), the enforcement of a comprehensive security policy for cloud  services is a challenging task. This is an opportunity for attackers: potential weaknesses in cloud  security are abused to gain access to company data. And these weaknesses are not at the cloud side  but rather at the user side. For example (cloud) identity theft: the easiest targets for attackers will be  weakly secured mobile devices accessing a cloud service.  Gradually, cloud services go beyond storage and cover hosting of applications and databases.  Through the proliferation of web services - accessed via browsers and apps - the cloud is exposed to  software vulnerabilities and web-specific attacks. In the reporting period we have seen many attack  patterns affecting cloud services based on threats like code injection217, malware and botnets218,219.  We will keep seeing these threats affecting cloud services, while cloud providers will further enhance  protection of their services via additional security mechanisms220. Moreover, the continuous  concentration of data in the cloud will raise issues of resilience, as these services are going to reach a  high degree of criticality. Nevertheless, in the reporting period significant efforts have been invested  by cloud providers in performing threat and risk assessments for cloud services221,222. Also other  stakeholders have issued protection practices for cloud services223. This contributes to a better  assurance of cloud services; in many cases protection offered in a cloud environment may be higher  than in legacy IT-environments. Yet due to complexity, the implementation of these measures  remains a challenge224.  215  http://www.pcworld.com/article/2059940/fake-social-media-id-duped-securityaware-it-guys.html, accessed 25 Nov  2013.  216 http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702304607104579212122084821400?mod=WSJ_hp_LEFTWhatsNe wsCollection, accessed 25 Nov 2014.  217  https://www.digitalocean.com/community/articles/how-to-secure-a-cloud-server-against-sql-injection, accessed 3 Dec  2013.  218  http://www.alertlogic.com/resources/cloud-security-report/, accessed 2 Dec 2013.  219  http://www.darkreading.com/cloud, accessed 4 Dec 2013.  220  http://www.cs.ucsb.edu/~koc/ns/projects/12Reports/PucherDimopoulos.pdf, accessed 3 Dec 2013.  221 https://downloads.cloudsecurityalliance.org/initiatives/top_threats/The_Notorious_Nine_Cloud_Computing_Top_Threa  ts_in_2013.pdf, accessed 26 Nov 2013.  222  http://security.force.com/security/tools/forcecom/scannerhelp, accessed 2 Dec 2013.  223  https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KBpPRBY9E0_v_H2JvFO-_XUXy-KSfBTRXOphjqoNS_4/edit?pli=1, accessed 3 Dec  2013.  224  http://www.darkreading.com/cloud/cloud-security-measures-too-opaque-for-c/240148526, accessed 3 Dec 2013.  http://www.pcworld.com/article/2059940/fake-social-media-id-duped-securityaware-it-guys.html http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702304607104579212122084821400?mod=WSJ_hp_LEFTWhatsNewsCollection http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702304607104579212122084821400?mod=WSJ_hp_LEFTWhatsNewsCollection https://www.digitalocean.com/community/articles/how-to-secure-a-cloud-server-against-sql-injection http://www.alertlogic.com/resources/cloud-security-report/ http://www.darkreading.com/cloud http://www.cs.ucsb.edu/~koc/ns/projects/12Reports/PucherDimopoulos.pdf https://downloads.cloudsecurityalliance.org/initiatives/top_threats/The_Notorious_Nine_Cloud_Computing_Top_Threats_in_2013.pdf https://downloads.cloudsecurityalliance.org/initiatives/top_threats/The_Notorious_Nine_Cloud_Computing_Top_Threats_in_2013.pdf http://security.force.com/security/tools/forcecom/scannerhelp https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KBpPRBY9E0_v_H2JvFO-_XUXy-KSfBTRXOphjqoNS_4/edit?pli=1 http://www.darkreading.com/cloud/cloud-security-measures-too-opaque-for-c/240148526  ENISA Threat Landscape 2013  Overview of current and emerging cyber-threats  11 December 2013  Page  50  Top emerging threats to cloud computing are225:  Emerging Threat Threat Trend  1.

Undoubtedly these concentrations of user data are THE target  for threat agents. Attackers will keep trying to take over control of these data226,227 and services  in order to achieve numerous of malicious objectives, the main being to breach large amounts of  data.   Following recent nation state sponsored espionage activities, one can expect customers to pay  more attention to the location of data centers and the impact of foreign legislation on cloud  services 228. Such issues might be show-stopper for existing cloud services and foster the creation  of appropriately equipped clouds. These issue will be relevant for a significant number of  225  It should be noted that the threats mentioned below result from the exposures of both customer and provider and  include all kinds of services offered/used (i.e. IaaS, PasS, SaaS).  226  http://www.websense.com/content/websense-2014-security-predictions-report.aspx, accessed 25 Nov 2013.  227  http://www.infosecurity-magazine.com/view/35234/sql-injection-and-crosssite-scripting-attacks-surge-in-q3/, accessed  25 Nov 2013.  228  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/cloud-computing/good-practice-guide-for-securely- deploying-governmental-clouds, accessed 25 Nov 2013.  http://www.websense.com/content/websense-2014-security-predictions-report.aspx http://www.infosecurity-magazine.com/view/35234/sql-injection-and-crosssite-scripting-attacks-surge-in-q3/ http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/cloud-computing/good-practice-guide-for-securely-deploying-governmental-clouds http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/cloud-computing/good-practice-guide-for-securely-deploying-governmental-clouds  ENISA Threat Landscape 2013  Overview of current and emerging cyber-threats  11 December 2013  Page  51  potential users coming from the governmental and agency sector, especially within  Europe229,230,231.   In general, the proliferation of web services accessed via browsers opens doors for all kinds of  web-specific threats in the entire chain of components involved in the interaction, that is, from  the client to the back end system. Hence, when cloud services are used (i.e. SaaS, IaaS) these are  exposed to threats abusing software vulnerabilities such as code injection, exploit kits,  rogueware/ransomware/scareware. Nevertheless, it is expected that cloud computing will  positively contribute to reduce exposure232. This is because of security measures that can be put  in place and enforcement of software and infrastructure architectures/frameworks.   The computing capabilities of cloud environments are an attractive use-case for cyber-criminals.  Instead of maintaining expensive and easy to locate own computing capabilities, powerful cloud  computers would be beneficial for their purposes for nefarious activities233,234. The race between  threat agents and cloud providers is going to be continued in 2014. Cloud providers will have to  find ways to detect malicious use of their resources.   Through the use of mobile computing, business users consume various cloud storage services for  the purposes of convenience. Often, these services are operated on private basis and circumvent  corporate security policies. Lax cloud security policies introduce a serious risk for corporate data.  Information thefts, elevation of privilege and data breaches are the results. It is expected that  the challenge of scrutinizing security of business data will continue bothering security  professionals.   Customers will look for encryption mechanisms/technology to mitigate certain risks, but  encryption can only mitigate some risks. In many cloud computing scenarios, customers are  actually processing data on the cloud platform, and this processing cannot, for example, be  encrypted to prevent eavesdropping by the provider. Further, current encryption  mechanisms/technology does not provide the desired efficiency for use within a cloud  environment179,235. It is expected that new mechanisms will be introduced in order to avoid  existing shortcomings236 of available approaches237.  5.5 Threat Trends in Trust Infrastructures  Trust infrastructures considered to be systems, components and functions that provide strong  authentication. As such, trust infrastructures are building the backbone for a variety of security  mechanisms, as they establish authenticity, and thus trust, between an object and a subject.  Subjects may be humans or other trustworthy components participating in a trusted interaction.  Such functions are increasingly utilized by service providers, while it is clear that authentication  methods without trusted devices (i.e. hardware/non-replicable tokens) are less secure and thus  229  http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_MEMO-13-898_en.htm, accessed 25 Nov 2013.  230  http://www.pcworld.idg.com.au/article/464906/european_us_cloud_providers_go_head-to- head_after_nsa_revelations/, accessed 25 Nov 2013.  231  http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/aug/08/nsa-revelations-fears-cloud-computing, accessed 25 Nov 2013.  232  http://www.infosecurity-magazine.com/view/32698/microsoft-unveils-cloudbased-realtime-botnet-infosharing- initiative/, accessed 25 Nov 2014.  233  http://securitywatch.pcmag.com/software/299448-malware-as-a-service-simplifies-launching-cyber-attacks, accessed  25 Nov 2013.  234 http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/9241629/Cybercriminals_use_Google_Cloud_Messaging_service_to_control_ malware_on_Android_devices accessed 25 Nov 2013.  235  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/flash-notes/securing-data-in-cyber-space/at_download/file, accessed 25 Nov  2013.  236  http://www.networkworld.com/news/tech/2013/040913-cloud-encryption-268542.html, accessed 25 Nov 2013.  237  http://eprint.iacr.org/2013/409.pdf, accessed 25 Nov 2013.  http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_MEMO-13-898_en.htm http://www.pcworld.idg.com.au/article/464906/european_us_cloud_providers_go_head-to-head_after_nsa_revelations/ http://www.pcworld.idg.com.au/article/464906/european_us_cloud_providers_go_head-to-head_after_nsa_revelations/ http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/aug/08/nsa-revelations-fears-cloud-computing http://www.infosecurity-magazine.com/view/32698/microsoft-unveils-cloudbased-realtime-botnet-infosharing-initiative/ http://www.infosecurity-magazine.com/view/32698/microsoft-unveils-cloudbased-realtime-botnet-infosharing-initiative/ http://securitywatch.pcmag.com/software/299448-malware-as-a-service-simplifies-launching-cyber-attacks http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/9241629/Cybercriminals_use_Google_Cloud_Messaging_service_to_control_malware_on_Android_devices http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/9241629/Cybercriminals_use_Google_Cloud_Messaging_service_to_control_malware_on_Android_devices http://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/flash-notes/securing-data-in-cyber-space/at_download/file http://www.networkworld.com/news/tech/2013/040913-cloud-encryption-268542.html http://eprint.iacr.org/2013/409.pdf  ENISA Threat Landscape 2013  Overview of current and emerging cyber-threats  11 December 2013  Page  52  vulnerable238. Trust infrastructures are one of the main targets of cyber criminals: successful attacks  against them unveil a wide variety of fraud options, especially in the area of banking, finance and  payment.  In the reporting period, ENISA has conducted work regarding trusted authentication in the area of e- Finance and e-Payment services. Various methods of widely used authentication services are  considered, including passwords (OTP, TAN), signatures (based on chip or mobile), tokens (OTP  generators, mobile phones, etc.), etc. Particular attention is being paid to multi-channel  authentication methods, i.e. two-factor authentication. This work examines the threat exposure of  electronic Identity and Authentication Systems (eIDAS) and assesses related risks. Though sector  specific, this work is considered representative for trust infrastructure. Conclusions made and open  issues can be applied to other related areas by analogy. Authentication has been addressed in other  related reports, by identifying risks, issues and gaps178.  Top emerging threats to trust infrastructure are:  Emerging Threat Threat Trend  1.

Unification of authentication methods  among various application areas should be an objective for operators of e-commerce, e- payment and e-baking applications.   Broken authentication 242  is a significant risk. Especially in web applications, broken  authentication has achieved second of top 10243. In the middle term, a more intensive testing of  weaknesses/potential attack patterns for used authentication mechanisms seems to be  necessary244.   Successful attacks on authentication target the human interface. It is important to raise  awareness among operations and users of authentication systems through continuous  training245,246.   Authentication mechanisms implemented through application and kernel functions are  susceptive to attacks bypassing sandboxes247. This fact underlines the importance of information  security in application development. It also demonstrates potential weaknesses of software  authentication solutions, especially for high risk operations/transactions.   Authentication over NFC-enabled devices is coming248. While this technology is considered as  very effective in implementing authentication/identification functions, the security functions of  NFC itself are not part of the NFC tag specification. Due to contactless nature of this protocol,  interception of communication is quite easy. As NFC becomes popular, attack methods on NFC  devices will be an issue to take care of in the middle term249.  5.6 Threat Trends in Big Data  Big data are large collections of data that emerge from the operation and usage of large  infrastructure, applications, devices/appliances, web services, user interaction, etc. In the reporting  period, big data has enjoyed significant popularity250251. Also the potential behind this “asset” has  been more extensively manifested and discussed199,252. As a matter of fact, big data seems to be  main source of monetization from commercial organisations that are in the possession of this  good253. This is gradually understood by end users as they suffered information losses or the  negative consequences to their privacy resulting from their online activities254.

In the short to medium term, big data is considered as an important asset that can be used as a  source for monetization through commercial organisations. Moreover, recent worldwide discussions  on surveillance based on big data have given rise to concerns about use vs. abuse of this information  with regard to the privacy of users.  But also the influence big data will have on the market are of big interest and importance: is big data  going to create monopolies that will build their influence on knowledge of user’s life and on profiles?  How are states going to regulate the collection and use of this information in order to find the best  balance between security and privacy, while maintaining the opportunities for new business models  to be developed and established?  Top emerging threats emerging from the misuse of big data by adversaries are255:  Emerging Threat Threat Trend  1. Information Leakage (big data leaks will provide information to  adversaries to facilitate the launch of attacks)    2. Data Breaches (information gained from big data will provide insights  in order to breach user and company data. Breaches of big data will  be a priority for attackers too)    3.

Targeted Attacks (this threat will be used in order to breach collected  big data from collecting organizations)    Legend:  Declining,  Stable,  Increasing  Table 9: Emerging threats and their trends in the area of Big Data  255  The threats considered are primarily related to the abuse of big data by adversaries to launch attacks. They do not cover  threat exposure of big data itself (i.e. manipulation, fraud, theft, etc.).  ENISA Threat Landscape 2013  Overview of current and emerging cyber-threats  11 December 2013  Page  55  Besides the above emerging threat landscape, the following issues have been identified:   As the amount of data created by user activities grows and users realize that this data is used for  business, profiling, marketing and analysis purposes256, the desire to keep information private  will grow257. This desire emerges from the feeling of complete and constant observability of their  lives through a virtually omnipresent, yet blurry defined “big brother”.   Given that big data will be the main source for collecting intelligence at all levels of society  (commercial, state), it inevitably moves in the focus of adversaries. And it does so in a dual way:  firstly it comprises main source of intelligence for malicious purposes, and as such becomes a  desirable good; and at the same time is a target for manipulations in order to hide own activities  (for the later see next point).   As big data will be increasingly used for analysis, anomaly detection, intelligence gathering by  governments and agencies, mission creep, etc., adversaries will look for ways to hide their  activities. In a similar manner, they will try to manipulate big data to seamlessly affect results of  analysis, metrics and fool established response mechanisms179.   Despite existing public/media confidence that big data is collected, controlled and analysed by  government agencies, the fact is that it mainly emerges through systems and technologies that  are owned and operated by private sector252. Hence, activities of governmental agencies take  place at a second level251 with regard to primary creation and collection. As far as this interaction  is not transparent, the fears of public regarding influence to democracy and self-determination  of private data usage will grow. Intransparent data collection and analysis regimes are a risk for  all involved actors and the pressure to mitigate this risk will constantly grow.   Uncontrolled collection, usage and dissemination of user and systems data are the perfect  playground for malicious activities. Over the existing cyber-physical relationship, fraud regarding  cyber-reputation and a person’s digital footmark is likely to happen. And is may have devastating  impact to people’s lives254. Such fraudulent activities targeting individual persons or group of  individuals will be based on access and manipulation of big data.   An important part of big data is data related to security. According to experiences gained in the  reporting period, it seems that harnessing the potential of big security data is still at an  immature state. Though commercially explored by security companies, security data has still  enormous potential with regard to coordination of activities, response and knowledge gathering.  Areas like threat analysis, attack pattern recognition and quick adaptation of existing defence  may be significantly advanced when using big security data. In short to medium term, the  security community will leverage on these potential advantages, forced by the number, variety,  sophistication and impact of cyber-attacks.   Security big data are quite easily available/accessible from non-commercial sources258,259. It  should be assessed if some controls might be necessary to identify potential recipients of this  information.  5.7 Threat Trends in the Interconnected Devices: The Internet of Things  Although not new260, the issue of security of interconnected devices and Internet of Things (IoT) has  bothered threat analysts in the reporting period179,180,257,264,266. This is obviously because of the  256  http://www.spiegel.de/netzwelt/web/lg-smart-tvs-senden-heimlich-nutzerdaten-in-die-konzernzentrale-a-934614.html,  accessed 26 Nov 2013.  257  http://www.symantec.com/connect/blogs/2014-predictions-symantec-0, accessed 26 Nov 2013.  258  http://datalossdb.org/, accessed 27 Nov 2013.  259  http://www.shodanhq.com/, accessed 27 Nov 2013.  260  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/media/press-releases/flying-2.0-study-of-internet-of-things-rfid-in-air-travel, accessed 26  Nov 2013.  http://www.spiegel.de/netzwelt/web/lg-smart-tvs-senden-heimlich-nutzerdaten-in-die-konzernzentrale-a-934614.html http://www.symantec.com/connect/blogs/2014-predictions-symantec-0 http://datalossdb.org/ http://www.shodanhq.com/ https://www.enisa.europa.eu/media/press-releases/flying-2.0-study-of-internet-of-things-rfid-in-air-travel  ENISA Threat Landscape 2013  Overview of current and emerging cyber-threats  11 December 2013  Page  56  estimated number of interconnected devices in one-two years’ time (ca. 15 to 25 billion179). Main  concern is the low level of security provided: small devices are interconnected, usually over insecure  channels and protocols, generate a great deal of data, are designed to perform primitive tasks and  do not implement any security measures.  Because of poor security, eventually poor maintenance but also due to the nature of data and  functions performed, smart environments are considered as the ultimate target for cyber criminals.  Potential impact of attacks based on, for example, home appliances will be very difficult to prevent.  One needs to imagine a phishing attack whereas the adversary possesses knowledge about the  whereabouts of the smart home of the victim. Or the impact of information leaked from a user’s  media centre in the creation of profiles. Not to talk about potential impact from the manipulation of  smart devices used within e-Health applications, monitoring of minors261 and elderly people. Even  critical infrastructure services based on smart devices are at risk262.  Given these developments, it is obvious that in the near future the Internet of Things is going to  attract the attention of cyber-security professionals, government and consumers. Although  potentially new threats are going to be emerge in this area, in the table below we try to  demonstrate how available threats may be applied to this ecosystem.

Moreover, given the fact that interconnected  devices permanently send data, they pose performance requirements to network  infrastructures, also outside their locations (based on the external interconnections available)180.   Dynamicity in connection of appliances leads to dynamic context and content of transmitted  data264. This leads to potentially large amount of vulnerabilities and security issues, as data may  reveal details about the functions, operating patterns and behaviour of the owner. This poses  significant privacy challenges/concerns180.   Devices have built in functionality, often as embedded systems. These functions are not  accessible to users, may include unknown functions265 and are difficult to update, maintain, i.e.  patching257 to accommodate updates fixing identified vulnerabilities266.   Due to none or low level security, smart environments per se do not generate information to  inform users about their operational status, nor can they be easily connected to existing security  back-end systems such as incident and emergency response.   Interconnected devices and smart environments provide an ideal environment for all threat  agent groups to perform malicious activities257 ranging from data collection and data  manipulation up to fooling home appliances of their victims, thus creating harm even to their  lives.  264  https://www.europol.europa.eu/content/project-2020-scenarios-future-cybercrime, accessed 26 Nov 2013.  265  http://doctorbeet.blogspot.gr/2013/11/lg-smart-tvs-logging-usb-filenames-and.html, accessed 26 Nov 2013.  266  http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2013/08/coming-soon-the-cybercrime-of-things/278409/, accessed 26  Nov 2013.  https://www.europol.europa.eu/content/project-2020-scenarios-future-cybercrime http://doctorbeet.blogspot.gr/2013/11/lg-smart-tvs-logging-usb-filenames-and.html http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2013/08/coming-soon-the-cybercrime-of-things/278409/  ENISA Threat Landscape 2013  Overview of current and emerging cyber-threats  11 December 2013  Page  58  Page intentionally left blank  ENISA Threat Landscape 2013  Overview of current and emerging cyber-threats  11 December 2013  Page  59  ETL 2013: Food for Thought  Lessons Learned and Conclusions  ENISA Threat Landscape 2013  Overview of current and emerging cyber-threats  11 December 2013  Page  60  6 Food for Thought: Lessons Learned and Conclusions  6.1 Lessons learned  Being in the second year of its existence ETL 2013 was a step forward in the learning curve of  information collection and threat analysis. In this section we would like to share some experience  gathered during this work. This experience concerns two sides of the activities performed: a) the  “process” followed in ENISA’s work, that is, experience with information collection and analysis, and  b) some highlights from the analysed content. In particular:  Lessons from the ETL process:   From the reception of this work, we believe that threat landscapes are very interesting for  multiple stakeholders in the area of cyber security and beyond. Although threat information is  available, analysis and assessment are at a low level of maturity.   It is necessary to include more information sources into the threat landscape, such as incident  data, perform better analysis of breaches and coordinate and enhance threat knowledge.   Social media are a very fast dissemination channel. Besides risks (see section 5.3) this brings  some advantages, especially when time matters as it is the case in threat analysis. By following  various individuals, organisations and groups in social media, we were in the position to increase  the speed of threat information acquisition.   By tracking the uptake of previous ENISA deliverables in the area of threat landscape (i.e. ETL  2012 and 2013 midyear report), we have found out that the appetite of the security and media  community with regards to information on threats and threat trends is quite big. One can argue  that this strong trend will be continued in the coming year.   Although usually outside of the scope of assessments, the threat landscape is significantly  affected by low frequency large impact events267,268,269,270 (black swans271). Black swans have an  impact on the threat landscape, as they represent high impact unexpected events. After a black  swan event, it is clear that a new kind of threat does exist (independently from the likelihood of  occurrence). It is then left to threat analysis if this kind of threat should be considered in threat  analysis. However, in the cyber security community, black swans are often meant to be seldom  events that are not being managed and/or their mitigation is expensive. This is a deviation from  the definition of black swan. This can create confusions within experts and bears risks.   In the reporting period we have found out that quite a few European organisations work on  areas touching the threat landscape. It is imperative that these organisations are coming  together and adapt their work in a way that all potential synergies are mobilized. ENISA will take  up this coordination task in the coming years.  Lessons from the analysed content:   Although fairly simple security measures significantly minimize threat exposure, it is remarkable  that still over half of the organisations fail to apply/implement them.  267  http://arstechnica.com/security/2013/03/spamhaus-ddos-grows-to-internet-threatening-size/, accessed 22 Oct 2013.  268  http://blog.crysys.hu/2013/02/miniduke/, accessed 22 Oct 2013.  269  http://intelreport.mandiant.com/, accessed 22 Oct 2013.  270  http://news.yahoo.com/e-u-pushes-stricter-data-protection-snowden-nsa-233347589.html, accessed 22 Oct 2013.  271  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_swan_theory, accessed 22 Oct 2013.  http://arstechnica.com/security/2013/03/spamhaus-ddos-grows-to-internet-threatening-size/ http://blog.crysys.hu/2013/02/miniduke/ http://intelreport.mandiant.com/ http://news.yahoo.com/e-u-pushes-stricter-data-protection-snowden-nsa-233347589.html http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_swan_theory  ENISA Threat Landscape 2013  Overview of current and emerging cyber-threats  11 December 2013  Page  61   Identification of regional trends is not always possible for all threats at a moderate level of  effort. This is because the geographic dimension for all kind of threats and incidents is not  always reported.   Relevance of threats for various organisation profiles is not always possible at a moderate level  of effort. This is because it is difficult to draw conclusions about types of assets found within  company profiles. Yet, ENISA work in 2013 in the area of smart grids and eID for financial  services has demonstrated that this is possible when sufficient resources and expertise are  available.   With the current level of cooperation, data availability and trust levels, it is not possible to  validate current threats and threat trends based on real data in a near-time manner. Although  significant amount of data exists, it is not optimally used for the validation of threat  assessments.Within ENISA it is planned to combine information collection (i.e. including Art 13a  activities272) with exchange of information with other stakeholders, both public and private ones.  This will be enforced witin the work on the ETL 2014.   Current practices in cyber security measures are based on the assumption that a cyber-security  strategy should minimize exposure of as many threats as possible. By transferring this approach  to the automotive sector, it is as if one tries to build a car that survives all accidents unscathed.   In the reporting period, we have seen a far better coverage of threat agents within the collected  material. A deficit in this area has been mentioned in the conclusions of ETL 2012. It seems that  the community has achieved good progress on this matter.   The awareness for cyber threats has increased, especially within security professionals. Albeit  being a result of a more efficient collection practices from ENISA’s side, there is evidence that in  the reporting period number, width and quality of threat information collected has significantly  increased. This is a significant and important improvement in comparison to 2012.   In the reporting period we were in the position to “test” own and other predictions made in  2012. The comparison has been made within 2013 mid-year report29. We have found out that  the majority of predictions for 2013 have been realized.   The arrest of the developer and operator of the exploit kit Blackhole54 is considered as a major  event in the reporting period. It remains to be seen what impact this event will have in the fast  developing area of exploit kits: is this going to create an unfilled gap, are other adversaries going  to take over further development of the tool or are other exploit kits going to fill the gap?  Evaluation of this situation is decisive for understanding the interconnections and levels of  cooperation among threat agents. This may be a strong indicator for the entire cyber-threat  landscape.  6.2 Conclusions  The above mentioned learned lessons bring us seamlessly to the conclusions of ETL 2013 by means  of open issue and need for further work. The sequence of open issues below is according to assumed  importance:   The end-user perspective needs to be seriously taken into account by the cyber-security  community. End-users have to get more actively involved in protection against cyber-  272  https://resilience.enisa.europa.eu/article-13, accessed 3 Dec 2013.  https://resilience.enisa.europa.eu/article-13  ENISA Threat Landscape 2013  Overview of current and emerging cyber-threats  11 December 2013  Page  62  threats. Analysis shows that knowledge about implementation of simple security measures  is not available in the wide basis of end-users. Adoption of simple security measures by end-  users would half the number of cyber incidents worldwide!   It has become clear that a greater coordination of information collection, analysis,  assessment and validation among involved organisations is necessary. Numerous public and  private organisations work on overlapping issues of threat information collection and threat  analysis. Increased coordination, for example, among the ones working on open source  information and ones working with operational data could increase quality and speed of  assessed threats.. Moreover, activities of Member States and stakeholders from private  sector will be also considered. Objective is to assess the feasibility of such  coordination/cooperation and establish proper areas and steps to obtain it.   Threats need to be expanded with additional information regarding attack workflow/kill  chains and attack patterns. This information needs to be extracted from incident analysis,  establishing thus the necessary feedback to improve quality of assessed threats. This will be  real added-value for all stakeholders using a threat landscape, as every threat description  would contain information on attack scenarios derived from real incidents.   Building threat intelligence remains one of the main challenges in the cyber-security  community: ways to facilitate information collection, develop tools to support threat  analysis, sharing of information, etc. In 2013 ENISA has delivered important information in  approaches and tools for creating and sharing threat intelligence273. It is important to  capitalize on these recommendations and establish a community working towards their  achievement.   In the analysed material, security experts have underlined the importance of increasing  speed in threat assessment and dissemination by reducing detection and assessment cycles.  In order to achieve this, stakeholders need to synergise (see above point) and tune up their  activities.   Increasing sophistication of attacks, increasing complexity of IT-architectures, increasing  volume of data and blurred limits of security perimeter pose significant challenges to cyber-  security defences. The research community need to examine the elasticity of security  measures: besides active measures (e.g. firewalls, IDSs), passive security mechanisms need  to be developed (e.g. automated policy generation, validation and enforcement274). IT-  infrastructures need to be resilient and robust to successful attacks without suffering severe  impact regarding their availability, integrity and confidentiality.  273  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/support/data-sharing, accessed 28 Nov 2013.  274  http://www.ptidej.net/seminar/130418%20-%20Makan%20Pourzandi%20-%20ESF%20--  %20An%20Elastic%20Security%20Framework%20For%20Cloud%20Infrastructures/130418%20- %20Makan%20Pourzandi%20-%20ESF%20-- %20An%20Elastic%20Security%20Framework%20For%20Cloud%20Infrastructures.pdf, accessed 3 Dec 2013.  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/support/data-sharing http://www.ptidej.net/seminar/130418%20-%20Makan%20Pourzandi%20-%20ESF%20--%20An%20Elastic%20Security%20Framework%20For%20Cloud%20Infrastructures/130418%20-%20Makan%20Pourzandi%20-%20ESF%20--%20An%20Elastic%20Security%20Framework%20For%20Cloud%20Infrastructures.pdf http://www.ptidej.net/seminar/130418%20-%20Makan%20Pourzandi%20-%20ESF%20--%20An%20Elastic%20Security%20Framework%20For%20Cloud%20Infrastructures/130418%20-%20Makan%20Pourzandi%20-%20ESF%20--%20An%20Elastic%20Security%20Framework%20For%20Cloud%20Infrastructures.pdf http://www.ptidej.net/seminar/130418%20-%20Makan%20Pourzandi%20-%20ESF%20--%20An%20Elastic%20Security%20Framework%20For%20Cloud%20Infrastructures/130418%20-%20Makan%20Pourzandi%20-%20ESF%20--%20An%20Elastic%20Security%20Framework%20For%20Cloud%20Infrastructures.pdf http://www.ptidej.net/seminar/130418%20-%20Makan%20Pourzandi%20-%20ESF%20--%20An%20Elastic%20Security%20Framework%20For%20Cloud%20Infrastructures/130418%20-%20Makan%20Pourzandi%20-%20ESF%20--%20An%20Elastic%20Security%20Framework%20For%20Cloud%20Infrastructures.pdf  ENISA Threat Landscape 2013  Overview of current and emerging cyber-threats  11 December 2013  Page  63  PO Box 1309, 710 01 Heraklion, Greece  Tel: +30 28 14 40 9710  info@enisa.europa.eu  www.enisa.europa.eu  TP-AE-13-001-EN -N  ENISA Headquarters  European Union Agency for Network and Information Security  Science and Technology Park of Crete (ITE)  Vassilika Vouton, 700 13, Heraklion, Greece  Athens Office  1 Vass.

Among the dynamic developments and changes that happened, there is one thing  that has remaained stable: the race between defenders and adversaries has continued and will  continue in the future.  Over 250 reports and sources have been analysed for this year’s report. From a threat landscape  perspective, 2013 has brought good and bad developments. Let’s start with the bad:   Threat agents have increased sophistication of their attacks and their tools.   It has become clear that maturity in cyber activities is not a matter of a handful of nation states.  Rather, multiple nation states have now developed capabilities that can be used to infiltrate all  kinds of targets both governmental and private ones in order to achieve their objectives.   Cyber-threats go mobile: attack patterns and tools that targeted PCs a few years ago, have been  migrated to the mobile ecosystem.   Two new digital battlefields have emerged: big data and the Internet of Things.  But 2013 has also brought us important good developments. Positive developments observed in  2013 in the area of cyber-threats include:   Impressive successes by law-enforcement have been achieved. The police has arrested a gang  responsible for the Police Virus. The Silk Road operator has been arrested and the platform has  been shut down. The developer and operator of Blackhole, the most popular exploit kit, has  been arrested.   The number of reports and data regarding cyber-threats has increased and so has the quality of  available information. This has facilitated threat analysis.   Vendors have increased the speed in which they respond to threats and vulnerabilities via  updates of their products.   Cooperation among relevant organisations to commonly assess and defend cyber-threats has  been envisaged and is going to gain speed in the near future.   Issues related to industrial espionage and state sponsored surveillance became a major  discussion topic during this reporting period. The ENISA Threat Report takes account of these  issues to the extent that these activities are related to assessed cyber-threats. It should be noted  however that, apart from providing guidelines on how to protect systems against the technical  threats enumerated, any additional response to industrial espionage and state sponsored  surveillance is not in ENISA's mandate.   The present document targets security professionals, decision makers, media and all other  interested individuals interested in obtaining information on threats and threat trends for  emerging technology areas.  Hopefully, lessons learned and conclusions drawn will help streamlining activities in the stakeholder  community. ENISA will capitalize on this knowledge and will inject it into the activities of  forthcoming ENISA Work Programmes:   Actively involve end-users in defence of cyber-threats;   Increase cyber-threat intelligence by creating and disseminating appropriate knowledge and by  coordinating activities of relevant organisations;   Increase the speed of threat assessment to reduce exposure;   Invest in research to enhance appropriateness of security policies and security controls.

The  rankings of emerging threat trends can be found in the corresponding section (see chapter 5). Arrows that show a  stability in a threat may be increasing in emerging areas. This is because current threat landscape includes all threats  independently from particular areas.

The ENISA Threat Landscape is a  reporton significant cyber-threats that have been assessed in the reporting period, i.e. within 2013.  Moreover, the ENISA Threat Landscape delivers predictions for threat trends regarding emerging  technology areas. The work on the ENISA Threat Landscape has been performed as part of the ENISA  Work Programme 2013 under the Work Stream “Evolving risk environment & opportunities”.  The objective of this work is to provide stakeholders with information about developments in the  cyber-threat landscape and to identify threat trends for the near future, ie in the coming year. For  the prediction of trends, important areas of IT innovation and development were taken as a basis.  The assessed top threats from 2013 are mapped to these areas and thus an emerging threat  landscape is created.  ETL 2013 is based on a comprehensive information collection of publicly available open source  material. Reports of various kinds (i.e. content, context, level of detail, subject areas, etc.) are  collected over the entire reporting period. These reports are parsed to identify relevant content,  such as threats, threat agents and trends. The collected information is collated and consolidated. In  2013, a large number of such reports have been collected (over 250). They span the period  beginning end 2012 up to the publication date of this report, ca. end of November 2013. Reports  appearing after this period will be considered in the next year’s ETL, to be delivered around the  same period in 2014.  In a similar fashion as in last year’s report, ETL 2013 includes:   A Current Threat Landscape consisting of contemporary developments of cyber-threats as  they have been reported by national and international stakeholders such as CERTS/CSIRTs,  industry, governmental organisations, networks of excellence, academia, press and  individual security experts;   An Emerging Threat Landscape consisting of threat trends identified for a number of  areas/sectors with high levels of innovation and market potential and,   Identification of Threat Agents being the main source of assessed cyber-threats.  Issues related to industrial espionage and state sponsored surveillance became a major discussion  topic during this reporting period. The ENISA Threat Report takes account of these issues to the  extent that these activities are related to assessed cyber-threats. It should be noted however that,  apart from providing guidelines on how to protect systems against the technical threats  enumerated, any additional response to industrial espionage and state sponsored surveillance is not  in ENISA's mandate.  In this year’s ETL, we have introduced the concept of “attack workflow”, indicating how assessed  threats are being deployed by threat agents within an attack. This information is considered as  important because it delivers information on how threats, the malicious tools of adversaries, are  being used in order to set up a successful attack.  Lessons learned and conclusions are indicating future actions for the cyber-security community in  order to achieve good progress in the subject of threat analysis and trend identification. In  forthcoming ENISA activities, these issues will be taken into account as a contribution in improving  cyber-security capabilities of all involved stakeholders.  ENISA Threat Landscape 2013  Overview of current and emerging cyber-threats  11 December 2013  Page  2  Policy Context  The Cyber Security Strategy of the EU2 stresses the importance of threat analysis and emerging  trends in cyber security. The ENISA Threat Landscape is an activity contributing towards the  achievement of objectives formulated in this regulation, in particular by contributing to the  identification of emerging trends in cyber-threats and understanding the evolution of cyber-crime  (see 2.4 regarding proposed role of ENISA).  Moreover, the new ENISA regulation3 mentions the necessity to analyse current and emerging risks  (and their components), stating: “the Agency, in cooperation with Member States and, as  appropriate, with statistical bodies and others, collects relevant information”. In particular, under  Art. 3, Tasks, d), iii), the new ENISA regulations states that ENISA should “enable effective responses  to current and emerging network and information security risks and threats”.  The ENISA Threat Landscape aims to make  a significant contribution to the EU Cyber Security  Strategy by streamlining and consolidating available information on cyber-threats and their  evolution.  Target audience  The target groups of this document are all specialists/individuals who are concerned with the  development/evolution of threats in cyber space: primarily security experts interested in assessing  the “external environment” and “Internal environments”4 in the framework of threat and risk  assessments. This information might be interesting when formulating security policies or creating  protection profiles. Finally, interested decision makers and users of IT components may find  information in order to make informed decisions towards investment for the protection of  potentially valuable assets or to define their risk appetite.  ETL 2013 will be of interest for policy makers: current threats and threat trends may be important  input in policy actions in the area of cyber-security, national cyber-security preparedness and  possible coordination and cooperation initiatives.  Through the large number of collected reports, ETL 2013 provides a unique collection of information  regarding cyber-security threats. Hence, a further target group of this document consists of  individuals who would like to obtain access to these sources in order to use them for their own  purposes.  Last but not least, and as experience with ETL 2012 has shown, the threat landscape is an important  piece of information for media as it provides to non-security experts information to understand  dependencies and developments in the area of cyber-security. Moreover, it serves as a continuous  source of information to better analyse and understand the whereabouts of incidents in the area of  cyber-security.  Structure of this document  The structure of ETL 2013 is as follows:  2  http://www.ec.europa.eu/digital-agenda/en/news/eu-cybersecurity-plan-protect-open-internet-and-online-freedom-  and-opportunity-cyber-security, accessed 28 Nov 2013.  3  http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2013:165:0041:0058:EN:PDF, accessed 28 Nov 2013.  4  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/risk-management/current-risk/risk-management-inventory/rm-process/rm-  process/crm-strategy/scope-framework, accessed 30 Oct 2013.  http://www.ec.europa.eu/digital-agenda/en/news/eu-cybersecurity-plan-protect-open-internet-and-online-freedom-and-opportunity-cyber-security http://www.ec.europa.eu/digital-agenda/en/news/eu-cybersecurity-plan-protect-open-internet-and-online-freedom-and-opportunity-cyber-security http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2013:165:0041:0058:EN:PDF http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/risk-management/current-risk/risk-management-inventory/rm-process/rm-process/crm-strategy/scope-framework http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/risk-management/current-risk/risk-management-inventory/rm-process/rm-process/crm-strategy/scope-framework  ENISA Threat Landscape 2013  Overview of current and emerging cyber-threats  11 December 2013  Page  3  In the chapter entitled “Purpose Scope and Method” we provide information about the scope of this  work, methods followed in the process of information collection, the position of ETL within the risk  assessment and risk management process and, finally the terminology used.  The chapter “Overview of Threat Agents” provides information about the cyber-adversaries. It  provides information about their motives and capabilities. Moreover, it shows what kinds of threats  are assumed within each threat agent group.  The chapter “Current Threat Landscape” provides information about the top 15 threats assessed this  year. For each threat a short description is provided, together with a number of issues concerning  developments within this threat. Moreover, the trends, other related threats and a graphical  representation of the threat within the attack workflow/kill chain are presented.  The chapter “Emerging Threat Landscape” provides information about threat trends in emerging  technology areas. For each emerging area, the top 10 threats are mentioned together with the  corresponding trends. Following this, a number of emerging issues related to threats and cyber- security in general are also delivered.  Finally, ETL 2013 is concluded by the chapter “Food for Thought: Lessons Learned and Conclusions”.  In this chapter the summarized experience in performing this task for a second year is being  presented, together with the conclusions showing open issues and future activities in the subject  matter.  At this point it should be stressed that particular emphasis was given to keeping ETL 2013 as  modular as possible. Chapters of this document have been developed in a way to comprise content  modules that are as independent as possible. The objective behind this decision is to enable  selective updates of the content of each module: should, for example, a midyear current threat  landscape be developed, the corresponding chapter can be taken as basis for the relevant updates.  This will save resources and maintain the consistency of the entire content.

In this year’s ETL, we will give an overview of its purpose by highlighting the major objectives to be  met by this document6. It is worth mentioning, that through the learning curve we have been  through in two years of ETL, some shifts/improvements in our practices have been introduced.  These developments are also reflected in the present chapter.  The purpose of ETL is to provide answers to the following key questions with regard to threats in  cyberspace and the purpose of ETL:  What is a threat landscape?  A threat landscape is a collection of threats. This information contains identified threats, trends  observed and threat agents involved. ETL consists of a list with top threats prioritized according to  the frequency of appearance and NOT according to the impact caused. The reason for this approach  is that we do not see ourselves in the position to objectively decide about impact levels. As  explained below in this section, this is a task that has to be left to the discretion of the asset owner.  Why does the threat landscape change?  The threat landscape, also called threat environment7,8,9,10, is a dynamically changing ecosystem.  Main forces contributing to these changes are: increased complexity of IT-products, various external  forces such as financial crisis, new vulnerabilities, sophistication of available tools and attacks,  available resources (both personnel and monetary), available skills, networks enabling knowledge  transfer and growth of illegal profits in cyberspace.  How many kinds of threat landscape exist?  Various types of threat landscape exist, depending on their orientation with regard to threatened  assets and with regard to the time horizon taken into account. Examples of sector oriented threat  landscapes are: a financial sector threat landscape, CIIP threat landscape11, health sector threat  landscape12. Examples of threat landscapes taking into account time are: current threat landscape13,  emerging threat landscape14, future threats15. Of particular importance are emerging threat  5  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/risk-management/evolving-threat-  environment/ENISA_Threat_Landscape/at_download/fullReport, accessed 18 Oct 2013.  6  Individuals interested in the details of ETL purpose may also refer to chapter “3 Scope and Definitions” of ETL 2012.  7 http://www.fbi.gov/news/testimony/protecting-the-nation-in-todays-complex-threat-environment, accessed 21 Oct  2013.  8  http://defensetech.org/2010/01/11/the-2010-cyber-threat-environment/, accessed 21 Oct 2013.  9  http://www.symantec.com/connect/blogs/changing-threat-environment-requires-mssps-adapt-their-approach, accessed  21 Oct 2013.  10  http://securityintelligence.com/keeping-up-with-the-changing-threat-environment/, accessed 21 Oct 2013.  11  An ENISA deliverable on Smart Grid Threat Landscape is going to be published soon.

What is the content of ETL?  ETL contains a summary of the current threat landscape and an emerging threat landscape. The  current threat landscape contains consolidated, prioritized list of threats that have been identified  by collecting publicly available threat information (see Chapter 3). The emerging threat landscape  presents threat trends in various key areas of information technology. Moreover, ETL provides  information on threat agents.  What has been left out from ETL?  In general, ETL is covering cyber-threats. Hence, threats resulting from the physical environment  (environmental,deliberate human actions, etc.) are not considered within this document. In this  year’s threat landscape we have not included any geographical data on threat distribution. Also,  threats that are not explicitly related to IT have been left out. Finally, attack patterns have not been  included in this year’s ETL. It is planned to cover these issue in prospective threat landscapes  depending on stakeholder demand and resource availability.  How many reports have been analysed and how have they been collected?  ENISA has analysed over 250 sources for the present threat analysis. The sources collected were  reports from private and public sector, information from blogs, discussions, prsentations, etc. They  have been collected by using Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) methods (see also chapter 2.4).  2.2 Scope, Rationale and Structure of ETL  In order to identify required protection levels of valuable assets it is common to perform a risk  assessment. Subsequently, security measures have to be introduced to achieve this protection by  mitigating (part of) the assessed risks. Other risks might be transferred or accepted. As discussed  below, threats are an important element in risk assessment.  In this chapter we present the scope of the ENISA Threat Landscape (ETL). It consists of a number of  threats to which IT and IT related assets are exposed. Hence, the presented threat landscape is an  important tool for those who want to assess the risks within an IT environment of any complexity.  Based on these risks, appropriate security measures can be selected to achieve risk mitigation.  The role of threats in the risk assessment equations becomes evident when looking at the  components of risks. According to the widely accepted ISO 27005 definition risks emerge when:  “Threats abuse vulnerabilities of assets to generate harm for the organization”. In more detailed  terms, we consider risk as taking into account the following elements:  Asset (Vulnerabilities, Controls), Threat (Threat Agent Profile, Likelihood) and Impact  The elements of risks are graphically depicted in the figure below:  ENISA Threat Landscape 2013  Overview of current and emerging cyber-threats  11 December 2013  Page  8  Figure 1: Threats targeting an asset by trying to exploit its vulnerabilities.  This figure has been adopted from ISO 13335-4 and shows how how threat agents (TA), deploying  threats (T) , try to exploit asset vulnerabilities (V) in order to harm/take over the asset. The asset  owner has implemented security measures (M) to protect the asset, that is, to eliminate negative  effects from threat exposure. The impact achieved by the potential materialization of a threat is the  final element to evaluate the risk of an asset (see also risk definition above).  While the definition of risks for an asset is a quite straight forward task, in complex environments it  is often a challenge to assess risks. This is due to interdependencies between assets, cascading  effects of vulnerabilities, dynamics in threat environment, capabilities of threat agents, attack  methods, etc.  From the above becomes clear that in order to assess risks, all elements of the risk equation need to  be available. ETL contributes to the understanding of the threat environment. With this information  at hand, asset owners will be in the position to assess risks applying to the assets they own. We  consider this as a win-win situation: ETL reflects changes in the dynamic threat environment to  support the ones who own and master the complexity of assets.  In fact, ETL is asset agnostic- that is- it does not assume any particular environment and/or the  processes implemented through it. The assessment of consequences of these threats to assets is left  to the asset owner. To this extent, ETL is a supporting tool for the performance of risk assessments.  Such a tool may be essential for the asset owner: the dynamics and main trends of the complex  threat environment are key to the assessment of the inherently complex, interdependent assets.  In this document, we provide information on threats and threat exposure in a consolidated form  compiled by analysing publicly available reports. In addition, we deliver information on how these  threats behave within certain areas/domains. This is done in terms of a prioritization of threats and  of identification of trends related to each area/domain.

The subject areas for the  specialized, sector oriented threat landscapes are identified with the support of ENISA stakeholders.  Finally, and in order to cover significant events in the area of cyber security, flash notes have been  defined as part of this work. With flash notes28, ENISA responds to important/high impact events  with statements consolidating published information, while at the same time – when relevant -  proposing mitigation/protection measures and/or establishing the context to activities at EU level.  In 2013, besides ETL (the present report), ENISA delivers two sector specific threat landscapes in the  areas of Smart Grid11 and Trust Services16.  The structure of the ETL 2013 is presented in Figure 2 below. The process behind the creation of ETL  is described in the forthcoming chapter (see chapter 2.4 below).  Figure 2: Structure and content of ETL stream of work within ENISA in 2013.  2.4 Methods and tools  The method followed for the creation of ETL is information collection, analysis and collation. As input  to these activities solely public information is used. Hence, the method we follow goes beyond pure  information research and uses the principles of Open-Source Intelligence17 (OSINT): it serves the  collection and dissemination of information to the appropriate audience in order to address threat  exposure in cyber space18 in a timely manner. Through this activity a basic level on intelligence on  cyber threats can be achieved that can be used in various cyber security assessment activities.  16  An ENISA deliverable on Tust Services is going to be published soon.

OSINT is particularly effective when collecting information about globally  relevant events, such as cyber threats and comprises a good practice in this area19,20,21. This is  because threat information can be identified timely and information from various sources can be  cross-checked and combined in order to establish the desired context, that is, to understand an  incident and find evidence about the whereabouts of the deployment and impact achieved. There  are online tools related to OSINT22,23,24. In this year’s ETL, available OSINT tools and their  relevance/capabilities/content has not been assessed by ENISA.  The performance of open source search assumes a set of skills related with the ability to find,  understand and validate required information25. The skills/challenges for open source searches are:  Understand who is knowledgeable: It is important to understand which sources provide what  information and how to find and follow-up on these sources. Examples are knowledgeable  individuals in social networking, blogs and online media. Due to the nature of threat information, it  is crucial to track available information timely.  Evaluate quality and accuracy of information: In the technological area of cyber security, details  matter. Hence, quality and accuracy of the collected information is an important attribute. It helps  to spot ambiguity/bias and to understand the origin of a threat, weaknesses exploited and potential  protection. This can be achieved via source validation26.  Filter the identified information: Once qualitative information has been identified, it needs to be  filtered in such a way to comply with the level, structure/attribution and context required for the  purpose at hand. This can be achieved by parsing the identified information on the basis of  structure/templates that reflect information requirements.  Find the right levels to store, associate and communicate: Once information has been filtered and  properly structured, ways to store it need to be found in order to serve the usability criteria set.  Moreover, both core and dynamic interconnections/relationships between stored information  objects need to be maintained/identified for future use cases. Last but not least, it is important to  find the right level and structure in order to present assessed information according to target group  profile(s).  Just as during 2012, ETL 2013 is based on information from reports and publications issued by actors  such as: Virus/Malware protection vendors; Information service of CERT-EU27; National security  agencies; Industrial associations and standardisation bodies; Commercial companies in the area of  cyber security; Networks of excellence; Academic institutions; Individual information security  experts.  ETL information collection has been performed over the following channels: Online media; Web- based content and information services; Social media content; Publicly available reports and  publications; Participation in relevant events; Discussions with various experts. It is remarkable that  in this year’s work, the channel of social media has proved to be very efficient in collecting  19  http://resources.infosecinstitute.com/using-osint-in-your-business/, accessed 23 Oct 2013.  20  http://www.infosecisland.com/download/index/id/109.html, accessed 23 Oct 2013.  21  http://clusit.it/docs/Rapporto_Clusit%202013_ENG.pdf, accessed 23 Oct 2013.  22  http://opensourcerss.net/, accessed 30 Oct 2013.  23  http://searchsecurity.techtarget.in/photostory/2240160102/Nine-must-have-OSINT-tools/1/Nine-OSINT-tools-every- security-researcher-must-have, accessed 30 Oct 2013.  24  http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/cybersecurity/Cybersecurity_Annotated_Bibliography, accessed 30 Oct 2013.  25  http://www.theosintgroup.com/open_source_intelligence.html, accessed 23 Oct 2013.  26  http://jeffreycarr.blogspot.co.uk/2013/11/in-osint-all-sources-arent-created-equal.html, accessed 2 Dec 2013.  27  http://cert.europa.eu/cert/filteredition/en/CERT-LatestNews.html, accessed 30 Oct 2013.  http://resources.infosecinstitute.com/using-osint-in-your-business/ http://www.infosecisland.com/download/index/id/109.html http://clusit.it/docs/Rapporto_Clusit%202013_ENG.pdf http://opensourcerss.net/ http://searchsecurity.techtarget.in/photostory/2240160102/Nine-must-have-OSINT-tools/1/Nine-OSINT-tools-every-security-researcher-must-have http://searchsecurity.techtarget.in/photostory/2240160102/Nine-must-have-OSINT-tools/1/Nine-OSINT-tools-every-security-researcher-must-have http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/cybersecurity/Cybersecurity_Annotated_Bibliography http://www.theosintgroup.com/open_source_intelligence.html http://jeffreycarr.blogspot.co.uk/2013/11/in-osint-all-sources-arent-created-equal.html http://cert.europa.eu/cert/filteredition/en/CERT-LatestNews.html  ENISA Threat Landscape 2013  Overview of current and emerging cyber-threats  11 December 2013  Page  11  information. By following various individuals and organisations, we were able to become aware of  issued reports and announcements very quickly.  Time matters in cyber security: the quicker an event has been spotted, reported and analysed, the  less the impact and the quicker a weakness will be fixed. For this reason ENISA has introduced  various ways of  covering cyber security incident/threat announcements. Significant events are  covered timely by means of flash notes28. Furthermore, as it was the case this year29, ENISA issues  midyear ETL reports in order to summarize important developments in threat landscape in the  middle of the reporting year. Finally, around year’s end the yearly ETL (the present document) is  issued. It is worth mentioning that this dissemination strategy is still at the beginning and is currently  under further development/evaluation/optimization.  2.5 Building Threat Intelligence: The Workflow of Attacks  As already mentioned in ETL 2012, building intelligence about cyber-threats is a consequent next  step following threat and vulnerability analysis. This intelligence is related to the understanding of  patterns that are common to attack scenarios. Hence the objective is to depart from simply listing  threats and vulnerabilities and try to understand patterns that are characteristic for attacks: the  workflow of attacks. In this workflow, threats, technical vulnerabilities, threat agents and user  actions are being put in connection. The causal relationship between them provides an end-to-end  perspective of all steps involved in an attack. Threat analysis - and in particular the identification of  top threats - provides significant insights into the whereabouts of an attack, yet it does not make up  the whole story. There are some additional elements making up an attack.  In various on-going activities in threat analysis and threat intelligence, approaches have been  developed to allow for a coherent representation of all indicators, actions and actors involved in an  attack30,31,32. This goes beyond the description of cyber-threats and includes information about the  campaign, observations made, indicators, protection, incidents and targeted asset.  The proliferation of such approaches requires significant effort in building the context of an attack  including information collection and analysis, incident data, threat agent information, exploitation  strategies. Although all these issues are important for the development of threat intelligence, within  the current version of ETL we consider as feasible to proceed with an initial step towards threat  intelligence by adding to assessed threat some information about the role of a threat in the  workflow of an attack. This will be performed by means of a marker (i.e. a bar spanning the relevant  steps) in the attack workflow to indicate in which step of the attack a particular threat is being  utilized. The use of attack workflows/kill chain is considered as a facilitator for building threat  intelligence. There is a long way to go in this direction. It is proposed that relevant players elaborate  further on this concept to provide more specialized information towards defending assets (see also  conclusions at the end of this document).  For this purpose we adopt the work done in “Kill Chains”33. A kill chain is a set of generic steps  characterising attacks. In particular, a kill chain consists of the following seven steps:  28  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/flash-notes, accessed 23 Oct 2013.  29  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/risk-management/evolving-threat-environment/enisa-threat-landscape-mid- year-2013, accessed 23 Oct 2013.  30  http://stix.mitre.org/, accessed 27 Nov 2013.  31  http://capec.mitre.org/, accessed 27 Nov 2013.  32  http://www.lockheedmartin.com/content/dam/lockheed/data/corporate/documents/LM-White-Paper-Intel-Driven- Defense.pdf, accessed 27 Nov 2013.  33  http://www.lockheedmartin.com/content/dam/lockheed/data/corporate/documents/LM-White-Paper-Intel-Driven- Defense.pdf, accessed 2 Dec 2013.  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/flash-notes http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/risk-management/evolving-threat-environment/enisa-threat-landscape-mid-year-2013 http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/risk-management/evolving-threat-environment/enisa-threat-landscape-mid-year-2013 http://stix.mitre.org/ http://capec.mitre.org/ http://www.lockheedmartin.com/content/dam/lockheed/data/corporate/documents/LM-White-Paper-Intel-Driven-Defense.pdf http://www.lockheedmartin.com/content/dam/lockheed/data/corporate/documents/LM-White-Paper-Intel-Driven-Defense.pdf http://www.lockheedmartin.com/content/dam/lockheed/data/corporate/documents/LM-White-Paper-Intel-Driven-Defense.pdf http://www.lockheedmartin.com/content/dam/lockheed/data/corporate/documents/LM-White-Paper-Intel-Driven-Defense.pdf  ENISA Threat Landscape 2013  Overview of current and emerging cyber-threats  11 December 2013  Page  12  Reconnaissance: is the action of researching and analysing information about the target and the  environment within which the attack will be deployed. In this phase, assumptions for the number  and kind of vulnerabilities to be exploited are being made.  Weaponization: is the phase where the malicious payload to be used has been selected and  “loaded”, that is, made ready for use for the target environment.  Delivery: is the action of transmission of the malicious payload to the target environment.  Exploitation: is the act of letting the delivered payload make his job by exploiting vulnerabilities that  are available in the target environment. Usually these are technical vulnerabilities but in some  attacks these may well also be systemic or organisational vulnerabilities including humans.  Installation: is the phase where the delivered payload has successfully exploited a vulnerability and  has been installed in the target environment.  Command and Control (C2): in this step the installed payload establishes outbound connection to  the controller environment in order to enable interaction with the adversary who launched the  attack.  Action on Objectives: this is the final phase of a successful attack where the threat agent is in the  position to take over the targeted asset. Depending on the kind of target, this activity may include  information retrieval, information manipulation, application misuse, etc.  The instrument of attack workflow has various use cases, depending on the available information on  an attack (e.g. desktop analysis, reverse engineering based on an incident, tracking of malicious  activities based on data, etc.). Within ETL, attack workflows (also referred to as kill chains) are used  to indicatively determine the role of an assessed threat within the seven phases of an attack. Due to  the fact that we take into account incident information but we do not perform incident analysis, the  threat information delivered in this report will be merely mapped among the first 6 phases of the  attack workflow. This is because ETL is based on desktop analysis and does not consider  consequences of successful attacks (incidents) that took place in the reporting period. However, for  some threats that inherently contain the targeted asset, step seven will be taken into account (i.e.  Denial of Service, Physical Damage/Theft/Loss, Data Breaches and Targeted Attacks).  The role of a threat in the attack workflow will be presented graphically, as shown in the example of  the figure below.  Figure 3: An example of attack workflow showing the role of Code Injection threat.  2.6 Used definitions  Just as in many complex areas, in cyber threat assessment wording matters. In the present section  we briefly present the terms used. Both within and outside this report, definitions facilitate the  understanding of used terms; further, and equally importantly, consistent use of terms contributes  towards better, quicker and more efficient knowledge transfer on cyber threats. This may enhance  the response capabilities to cyber threats.

In order to visualize the relationships  among all elements of risks, we use a figure taken from ISO 15408:2005 (see Figure 4). This figure  has a level of granularity that is sufficient to illustrate most of the elements of risk mentioned in this  section. It should be noted that “owner” refers to the owner of the asset; moreover, the issue of  attack pattern is not displayed in this figure. Attack patterns have been left out of the scope of this  report and will be subject of forthcoming work in the area of threat landscape.

The material presented is the Current Treat Landscape 2013. The assessment is  based on reports that have been published until ca. mid of November 2013. Hence, the present  report takes into account relevant publications and information that spans approximately one year  (December 2012-November 2013). The remaining publications from this year will flow into the ETL  2014, eventually in form of a mid-year and an end year report.  As already stated, the assessed threats have been prioritized according to the frequency of their  appearance/reference in corresponding reports. The references found are mostly based on detected  incidents and infections. In some cases, they are based on estimated appearances of a threat, for  example regarding spam and denial of service. In prioritizing these threats within a single list, the  need to extrapolate those values arose. In the presentation of the threats below, more frequent  threats are mentioned first.  Having said that, it is worth mentioning that further prioritization criteria are also feasible, such as  geographical spread, classification according to categories of impacted assets, according to threat  agents, according to kind of organisations affected, etc. We have chosen appearance frequency as  the priority scheme to balance available resources and quality of the required analysis. During the  reporting period, various stakeholders have proposed using additional schemes, in particular  geographic spread (i.e. regarding European territory) and size of organisations affected (i.e. large  organisations vs. SMEs). These requests are under consideration and the feasibility of their  implementation will be evaluated in upcoming versions of ETL.  In the following discussion, the top 15 threats from end 2012 to end 2013 can be found. Threat  descriptions consist of i) a short text explaining the whereabouts of the threat, ii) a list of findings, iii)  the trend observed in the reporting period, iv) other related threats that are used in combination to  a threat and v) the position of the threat in the attack workflow.  This chapter is concluded by a comparison between the current threat landscapes of ETL 2012 and  ETL 2013. This will help readers to easily understand the changes of the current threat landscape in  this time period.  3.1 Drive-By Downloads  Web based attacks implementing drive-by downloads scores for one more year as the top cyber  threat. This is quite natural as web browsers are the first level of user interaction with the Internet.  As such, web pages, web servers and web services have become the most important attack surface:  attackers target web sites with the aim to infect them with malicious code, usually exploit kits (see  corresponding threat below). Infected web sites are referred to as malicious URLs and are “door  openers” for other threats such as exploit kits and malicious code infections (i.e. Worms/Trojans).  Visitors of these web sites are automatically scanned through the maliciously installed exploit kits for  weaknesses/vulnerabilities. Once vulnerabilities have been found in the device of the visitor, exploit  kits automatically install the appropriate malware on the device. The installed malware may vary  significantly according to the underlying user system/configuration and the vulnerabilities found.  This threat belongs to the broad category of unauthorised software installation to the victim’s  device: starting from a victim web server and reaching the devices of visitors.  In the reporting period we have assessed that:  ENISA Threat Landscape 2013  Overview of current and emerging cyber-threats  11 December 2013  Page  17   Web based attacks remain as the number one threat. Malicious URLs are considered the main  channel for malware installation. It has been observed that there is a shift from Botnets to URLs  as means for malware distribution56.   Java remains the most exploited software34,35  to infect a web site. In addition, attackers use code  injection attacks (see threat below) to create malicious URLs47.   As predicted in 2012, drive-by downloads have fully embraced mobile platforms. Just as any  other device, mobile platforms are targeted by vulnerability scanning capabilities of exploit kits.   As mentioned in the code injection threat below, manipulated CMSs are another source for the  creation of malicious URLs36,37.   Web based attacks are increasingly used within targeted attacks. Through the watering hole  technique, attackers lure a specific group of victims to visit their malicious URLs. This technique  has been increasingly used in 2013 with high infection rates38,47 (see also threat below).  Observed current trend for this threat: increasing  Related threats: Code Injection, Exploit Kits, Worms/Trojans, Rogueware/Ransomware/Scareware,  Targeted Attacks, Watering Hole.

Malware and particularly trojans have been derived from previous versions in  thousands of variants. This is due to the use of available toolkits allowing for the generation of user  defined malware through variations of existing malware code. Due to functionality offered by  toolkits, this activity can be performed by adversaries with moderate capabilities. The vast number  of malware variations is deployed as an effective method to fool signature-based virus scanners: due  to their large numbers, signatures of the created variants are not always available, leading thus to  unnoticed infections. Mobile platforms supported the successful deployment of this threat. Mobile  malware takes a significant part in malware statistics.  In the reporting period we have assessed that:  34  http://www.kaspersky.com/about/news/virus/2012/Oracle_Java_surpasses_Adobe_Reader_as_the_most_frequently_ex ploited_software, accessed 8 August 2013.  35  http://globenewswire.com/news-release/2013/07/18/561078/10041006/en/Bit9-Research-Shows-Java-is-Most- Targeted-Endpoint-Technology-for-Cyber-Attacks-Widely-Deployed-Older-Versions-Represent-Greatest-Risk.html,  accessed 8 August 2013.  36  http://www.symantec.com/connect/blogs/risk-content-management-systems, accessed 18 Nov 2013.  37  https://www.bsi.bund.de/DE/Publikationen/Studien/CMS/Studie_CMS.html, accessed 18 Nov 2013.  38  http://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/14725/hacking/watering-hole-attacks-exploit-kits-indian-gov-site-case.html,  accessed 18 Nov 2013.  http://www.kaspersky.com/about/news/virus/2012/Oracle_Java_surpasses_Adobe_Reader_as_the_most_frequently_exploited_software http://www.kaspersky.com/about/news/virus/2012/Oracle_Java_surpasses_Adobe_Reader_as_the_most_frequently_exploited_software http://globenewswire.com/news-release/2013/07/18/561078/10041006/en/Bit9-Research-Shows-Java-is-Most-Targeted-Endpoint-Technology-for-Cyber-Attacks-Widely-Deployed-Older-Versions-Represent-Greatest-Risk.html http://globenewswire.com/news-release/2013/07/18/561078/10041006/en/Bit9-Research-Shows-Java-is-Most-Targeted-Endpoint-Technology-for-Cyber-Attacks-Widely-Deployed-Older-Versions-Represent-Greatest-Risk.html http://www.symantec.com/connect/blogs/risk-content-management-systems https://www.bsi.bund.de/DE/Publikationen/Studien/CMS/Studie_CMS.html http://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/14725/hacking/watering-hole-attacks-exploit-kits-indian-gov-site-case.html  ENISA Threat Landscape 2013  Overview of current and emerging cyber-threats  11 December 2013  Page  18   Malware increasingly targets mobile platforms, with mobile trojans coming at the first position.  This is due to the increasing use of mobile devices, the increased sophistication of attacks (see  below) but also due to the weaker/immature security mechanisms implemented on these  platforms.   Available attack tools (see also exploit kits) allow for the creation of malware variants based on  available malware code. This activity can be performed even from users with moderate  capabilities. This phenomenon is called polymorphism of existing code and is a key trend in  malware development.   An increased sophistication in malware has been reported, especially on mobile platforms. Code  obfuscation (i.e. code that bypasses vetting process of gated app stores) and use of multiple  channels use are some characteristics of the complexity of malware39.   Coordinated activities of developers have demonstrated their true potential in generating  sophisticated malware by launching malware attacks against Mac computers40,47.   There is a growing black/grey market for stolen user data41. This brings information stealing  malware on the rise. Given the increased use mobile devices and the sophistication of attacks,  information stealing malware is here to stay.   Rogue certificates have been used to sign malicious code and thus distribute signed apps42. This  has demonstrated that incidents with rogue certificates are still a serious risk that cannot be  easily mitigated109,43.  Observed current trend for this threat: increasing  Related threats: Drive-by Downloads, Code Injection, Exploit Kits, Botnets, Identity Theft/, Data  Breaches, Rogueware/Ransomware/Scareware, Phishing, Targeted Attacks.

Within 2013 Code injection attacks are on sharp rise. The proliferation of automated attack tools  impacted the frequency of this threat in the reporting period: hackers are in the position to launch  large vulnerability scans in short time.  In the reporting period we have assessed that:  39  http://www.infosecurity-magazine.com/view/31801/mobile-malware-gets-serious-rats-can-bypass-sandboxes-and- encryption/, accessed 18 Nov 2013.  40  http://www.f-secure.com/weblog/archives/00002558.html, accessed 18 Nov 2013.  41  http://gigaom.com/2013/08/22/your-identity-is-probably-worth-5-on-the-black-market/, accessed 18 Nov 2013.  42  http://threatpost.com/winnti-cyberespionage-campaign-targets-gaming-companies-041113, accessed 8 Nov 2013.  43  https://www.csis.dk/en/csis/blog/4114/#, accessed 3 December 2013.  http://www.infosecurity-magazine.com/view/31801/mobile-malware-gets-serious-rats-can-bypass-sandboxes-and-encryption/ http://www.infosecurity-magazine.com/view/31801/mobile-malware-gets-serious-rats-can-bypass-sandboxes-and-encryption/ http://www.f-secure.com/weblog/archives/00002558.html http://gigaom.com/2013/08/22/your-identity-is-probably-worth-5-on-the-black-market/ http://threatpost.com/winnti-cyberespionage-campaign-targets-gaming-companies-041113 https://www.csis.dk/en/csis/blog/4114/  ENISA Threat Landscape 2013  Overview of current and emerging cyber-threats  11 December 2013  Page  19   A notable issue with regard to this threat is attacks against popular Content Management  Systems (CMSs). Due to their wide use, popular CMSs make up a considerable attack surface that  has drawn the attention of cyber-criminals44,45.   Large scale automated attacks are being increasingly launched from within cloud service  provider networks61.   Code injections are combined with other threats to successfully infect victims144. A typical  example in the reporting period is a series of incidents that have been caused by successful  attacks combining SQLi together with spear-phishing and watering hole techniques46.  Observed current trend for this threat: increasing  Related threats: Drive-by Downloads, Exploit Kits, Data Breaches, Targeted Attacks.  Reconnaissance Weaponisation Delivery Exploitation Installation Command and Control  Actions on Objectives  Code Injection  Step of Attack Workflow  Width of Purpose  Figure 7: Position of Code Injection in attack workflow  3.4 Exploit Kits  Exploit kits are the main tools in the hands of threat agents. These are ready-to-use software tools  offering a large variety of functions, configuration options and automated means to launch attacks.  Exploit kits search for vulnerabilities in order to abuse them and launch any applicable attack to take  over an asset (also mentioned as Exploit attacks47). Exploit kits have been heavily used by hackers  within the reporting period. Further, it has been reported that new business models emerge around  such tools: developers of exploit kits maintain interaction with customers by offering support,  customized configurations, etc48,49. The ability for updating, customization and the degree of  automation provided is considered to be one of the main parameters for increase in all kinds of  threats supported, such as malware, code injections, exploitation of vulnerabilities, etc.  In the reporting period we have assessed that:   Exploit kits are entering a new era of higher maturity towards developer/user relationship.  Additional “services”50,51 are developed and it seems that developers and users of exploit kits are  two distinct types of cyber threat agents.  44  http://www.h-online.com/open/news/item/CMSs-mostly-vulnerable-through-addons-says-German-security-agency- 1894431.html, accessed 8 August 2013.  45  http://securitywatch.pcmag.com/security/310350-wordpress-joomla-sites-under-brute-force-password-attack, accessed  8 August 2013.  46  http://www.infosecurity-magazine.com/view/33493/water-hole-replacing-spearphishing-as-statesponsored-weapon-of-  choice/, accessed 2 Dec 2103.  47  http://www.f-secure.com/static/doc/labs_global/Research/Threat_Report_H1_2013.pdf, accessed 4 Nov 2013.  48  http://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/what-to-expect-from-toolkits-and-exploit-kits-this-2013/,  accessed 4 Nov 2013.  49  http://networksasia.net/article/cybercrime-exposed-cybercrime-service-1372901941, accessed 7 Nov 2013.  50  https://blog.damballa.com/archives/1893, accessed 18 Nov 2013.  51  http://resources.infosecinstitute.com/cybercrime-as-a-service/, accessed 18 Nov 2013.  http://www.h-online.com/open/news/item/CMSs-mostly-vulnerable-through-addons-says-German-security-agency-1894431.html http://www.h-online.com/open/news/item/CMSs-mostly-vulnerable-through-addons-says-German-security-agency-1894431.html http://securitywatch.pcmag.com/security/310350-wordpress-joomla-sites-under-brute-force-password-attack http://www.infosecurity-magazine.com/view/33493/water-hole-replacing-spearphishing-as-statesponsored-weapon-of-choice/ http://www.infosecurity-magazine.com/view/33493/water-hole-replacing-spearphishing-as-statesponsored-weapon-of-choice/ http://www.f-secure.com/static/doc/labs_global/Research/Threat_Report_H1_2013.pdf http://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/what-to-expect-from-toolkits-and-exploit-kits-this-2013/ http://networksasia.net/article/cybercrime-exposed-cybercrime-service-1372901941 https://blog.damballa.com/archives/1893 http://resources.infosecinstitute.com/cybercrime-as-a-service/  ENISA Threat Landscape 2013  Overview of current and emerging cyber-threats  11 December 2013  Page  20   Users are confronted to exploit kits mostly by accessing compromised URLs (see threat drive-by  downloads above).   Due to the popularity of exploit kits and the emerging need to feed them with known  vulnerabilities, there is an increasing interest in zero-day vulnerabilities. This is a significant  amplification effect for the market of exploits/vulnerabilities52. It is important to note that both  hostile and friendly actors in cyber space show interest in purchasing zero-day vulnerabilities47.   Efforts have been invested by exploit kit developers to encrypt their payloads, thus make them  invisible from detection mechanisms53.   Due to the existence of a market, it is expected that a developers instead of developing new  malware, will concentrate on development of exploit kits48. Rather, exploit kits will be able to  include new malware and available vulnerabilities.   The developer and operator of Blackhole54, the most successful exploit kit has been arrested. It  will be very interesting to observe future developments with this malicious tool. Are other threat  agents going to take over development and operation of Blackhole or its derivates? Are other  tools going to fill the possibly created gap? It is suggested to keep an eye on this issue, as it going  to introduce significant impact to the threat landscape.  Observed current trend for this threat: increasing  Related threats: Drive-by Downloads, Code Injection, Worms/Trojans, Phishing,  Rogueware/Ransomware/Scareware.  Reconnaissance Weaponisation Delivery Exploitation Installation Command and Control  Actions on Objectives  Exploit Kits  Step of Attack Workflow  Width of Purpose  Figure 8: Position of Exploit Kits in attack workflow  3.5 Botnets  Botnets, networks of compromised, remotely controlled computers, still pose a serious cyber threat.  Being one of the oldest and more “mature” malicious infrastructures in cyber space, botnets  currently undergo significant changes in their adaptation, reduction of traceability, business cases,  channels used and technology usage. In the reporting period we have seen some of these changes  become reality. The use of peer-to-peer technologies, not only increases the resilience of single  nodes, it also enhances their ability to stay undetected. Although this development has been  observed since 2012, the benefits of this technology have been demonstrated in 2013, as they can  run on cloud infrastructures. Noticeable changes in the business models include a shift from botnets  to URLs as means to install malware. Further, the botnet business model has concentrated on  Bitcoin mining55. In addition, click fraud payloads have been deployed.  52  http://www.forbes.com/sites/andygreenberg/2012/03/23/shopping-for-zero-days-an-price-list-for-hackers-secret- software-exploits/, accessed 4 Nov 2013.  53  http://resources.infosecinstitute.com/battling-cyber-warriors-exploit-kits/, accessed 18 Nov 2013.  54  http://www.zdnet.com/blackhole-malware-toolkit-creator-paunch-arrested-7000021740/, accessed 28 Nov 2013.  55  http://www.fortinet.com/press_releases/2013/fortiguard_threat_landscape_research_team_reports.html, accessed 4  Nov 2013.  http://www.forbes.com/sites/andygreenberg/2012/03/23/shopping-for-zero-days-an-price-list-for-hackers-secret-software-exploits/ http://www.forbes.com/sites/andygreenberg/2012/03/23/shopping-for-zero-days-an-price-list-for-hackers-secret-software-exploits/ http://resources.infosecinstitute.com/battling-cyber-warriors-exploit-kits/ http://www.zdnet.com/blackhole-malware-toolkit-creator-paunch-arrested-7000021740/ http://www.fortinet.com/press_releases/2013/fortiguard_threat_landscape_research_team_reports.html  ENISA Threat Landscape 2013  Overview of current and emerging cyber-threats  11 December 2013  Page  21  In the reporting period we have assessed that:   Threat analysts see malicious URLs replacing botnets as the primary means for distribution  malware (see also drive-by downloads above)56. Botnets are on decline with regard to this  threat.   Existing botnet infrastructure has been updated with P2P technology57. This increases resilience  of botnet nodes when servers are taken down.   Existing versions of botnet infrastructure are equipped with Bitcoin mining and click fraud  functions. At the same time, they continue targeting social networks with spam.   Botnets sometimes use the anonymizing network TOR. Lately malware families have been found  using TOR as communication network58. It can be assumed that a considerable part of the vast  increase of TOR traffic is caused by its use for malicious purposes59,60.   Although botnet malware infections are on the decline56, it seems that botnets are still one of  the most important cyber threats. The reasons for can be found in changes of malware infection  strategies, use of P2P technology, use of anonymizing technologies etc.   Within the current trend of cyber-crime-as-a-service, we see various “traditional” botnet  functions to be offered as a service; similarly the availability of hosting services makes the use of  cloud as a high performance botnet feasible61,62.  Observed current trend for this threat: stable/slightly increasing  Related threats: Drive-by Downloads, Worms/Trojans, Phishing, Spam, Denial of Service,  Rogueware/Ransomware/Scareware.

Meanwhile, it is considered that  hacking is not the main cause of data loss: ca. 36% of data breaches are attributed to theft/loss of  devices64.  In the reporting period we have assessed that:   Damage of devices seems to be the number one cause for losing data63. And although users are  concerned about cyber-attacks, the awareness about the possibility of a damage/loss of device  seems to be rather low. In this area there is a lot of space for improvements.   As already assessed within the threat of data breach (see above), a significant part of data  breaches is caused through physical access to the storage device. Theft/damage/loss seems to  be the main cause for this65.   Most of the data on damage, theft or loss are based on surveys/statistics and not on incidents.  This is due to the fact that related incidents on physical damage, theft and loss are not always  reported and gathered. Hence concluded damages (and costs118) are just estimations that need  to be validated.   To reduce the impact of the damage/theft/loss threat, it is noticeable that the following factors  play a significant role towards a reduction of incurred costs: “strong security posture, incident  response capabilities and appointment of a CISO”118.  Observed current trend for this threat: increasing  Related threats: none  Reconnaissance Weaponisation Delivery Exploitation Installation Command and Control  Actions on Objectives  Physical  Damage/Theft/  Loss  Step of Attack Workflow  Width of Purpose  Figure 10: Position of Physical Damage/Theft/Loss in attack workflow  3.7 Identity Theft/Fraud  Identity theft and identity fraud are threats that have led to some of the most impressive successful  attacks in the reporting period63,66. Identity theft is one of the core activities of many threat agent  groups, as it gives access to a lot of data that bear potential for numerous malicious activities.  Malware and trojans belong to the main tools to perform identity theft. In 2013, for example,  financial trojans (e.g. Zeus, SpyEye, Citadel67)  have been use to implement 2-factor authentication  attack on mobile platforms68. The interest in identity theft, but also its importance in deploying  multiple attacks has led to the creation of a market for this kind of data96. It is expected, that this  threat will continue increasing, as the methods used increase in sophistication and spread.  In the reporting period we have assessed that:  63  http://media.kaspersky.com/pdf/Kaspersky_Lab_B2C_Summary_2013_final_EN.pdf, accessed 7 Nov 2013.  64  http://www.symantec.com/connect/blogs/symantec-intelligence-report-may-2013, accessed 7 Nov 2013.  65  http://www.acronis.com/download/docs/glme/whitepaper2 , accessed 7 November 2013.  66  http://krebsonsecurity.com/2013/09/data-broker-giants-hacked-by-id-theft-service/, accessed 19 Nov 2013.  67  http://www.mcafee.com/us/resources/white-papers/wp-citadel-trojan.pdf, accessed 7 Nov 2013.  68  http://www.emc.com/collateral/fraud-report/current-state-cybercrime-2013.pdf, accessed 7 Nov 2013.  http://media.kaspersky.com/pdf/Kaspersky_Lab_B2C_Summary_2013_final_EN.pdf http://www.symantec.com/connect/blogs/symantec-intelligence-report-may-2013 http://krebsonsecurity.com/2013/09/data-broker-giants-hacked-by-id-theft-service/ http://www.mcafee.com/us/resources/white-papers/wp-citadel-trojan.pdf http://www.emc.com/collateral/fraud-report/current-state-cybercrime-2013.pdf  ENISA Threat Landscape 2013  Overview of current and emerging cyber-threats  11 December 2013  Page  23   The inclusion of mobile platforms in identity hunting malware is a matter of fact and has  demonstrated the potential behind successful attack on these platforms. As expected, data on  financial and payment institutions are the most prominent ones for identity theft69,70.   A significant source for applying this threat remains social media71. It is worth mentioning that  an increase in malicious browser extensions has been registered, aimed at taking over social  network accounts72,73. A market around social accounts has already been created74   The use of Near Field Communication (NFC) capabilities for financial transactions, exchange of  messages and interaction with other devices increases. This technology will provide an attack  surface, especially with regard to eavesdropping75.   Man-in-the-browser attacks are similar to man-in-the-middle attacks except that the  intervention on an infected device happens over a Trojan that deviates traffic over a botnet (e.g.  SpyEye v1.3 botnet76). Through these attacks, threat agents are stealing almost any information  from the browser memory77.   It is worth noticing how threat agents adapt to additional authentication mechanisms used for  securing identity information, especially in financial transactions. SMS forwarding has been  introduced to existing malware. This includes permissions linked with the SMS relay, whereas PC  injection requests users to ender data that are also displayed on the handset. Hence a  connection between these devices is established. Then the malware takes over SMS  communication with the bank and misuses communicated credentials78 (i.e. man-in-the-mobile).

After the  Spamhaus80 attack, DNS reflection attacks have gained in popularity81,82. DNS reflection amplification  attacks target poorely configured DNS servers. Attackers seem to have adopted the DNS reflection  technique to launch amplification attacks, an old technique that has made a come-back. Another  reason for this increase is assumed in the availability of easy-to-use attack tools that embrace DoS  capabilities82. Users with low skills can easily launch DoS attacks, and, when done in orchestration  with other actors, significant striking power can be developed. Moreover, available high  performance botnets contribute to the increased volume of DoS attacks83. Amplification, wide  availability of tools/resources and coordination among threat agent groups seem to be the reason  for the impressive DoS bandwidths achieved (2-10Gbps up to 300Gbps85,86). The duration of attack  has grown, indicating that attackers are risking detection of their resources (botnets, tools) in order  to maximize impact on the attacked sites  In the reporting period we have assessed that:   Sophistication of DoS attacks grows (multi-vendor and multi-layer attacks) making them difficult  to defend84.   Performance of available DoS attack infrastructure has grown. This includes both use of  technology (amplification) and involved threat agents (coordination, orchestration).   Features of attack infrastructure (see botnets above) such as resilience, clandestine  communication and use of encryption lower detectability and allow for a longer duration of  attacks.   Attack bandwidths achieved have reached impressive levels: the rate of 2-10Gbps attacks has  doubled85 and the level of 300Gbps attack was reached in 201386.   While DoS targets mainly enterprise and commerce it seems that US and Asia Pacific are more  targeted through DoS. Europe has lower attack rates87.   A series of DDoS attacks to banks has drawn the attention of security professional in the  reporting period88.  Observed current trend for this threat: increasing  Related threats: Botnets, Worms/Trojans.  79  http://www.arbornetworks.com/corporate/blog/5025-q3-findings-from-atlas, accessed 5 Nov 2013.  80  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/flash-notes/flash-note-can-recent-attacks-really-threaten-internet- availability/at_download/fullReport, accessed 8 August 2013.  81  http://www.akamai.com/stateoftheinternet/, accessed 8 August 2013.  82  https://www.prolexic.com/knowledge-center-ddos-attack-report-2013-q2/pr.html, accessed 5 Nov 2013.  83  http://arstechnica.com/security/2013/04/fueled-by-super-botnets-ddos-attacks-grow-meaner-and-ever-more- powerful/, accessed 5 Nov 2013.  84  https://www.securityweek.com/multi-vector-ddos-attacks-grow, accessed 5 Nov 2013.  85  http://www.arbornetworks.com/corporate/blog/4922-q2-key-findings-from-atlas, accessed 8 August 2013.  86  http://www.arbornetworks.com/corporate/blog/4813-putting-the-spamhouse-ddos-attack-in-perspective, accessed 8  August 2013.  87  http://www.akamai.com/dl/akamai/akamai_soti_q213_exec_summary.pdf, accessed 5 Nov 2013.  88  http://www.bankinfosecurity.com/ddos-what-to-expect-from-next-attacks-a-5653, accessed 18 Nov 2013.  http://www.arbornetworks.com/corporate/blog/5025-q3-findings-from-atlas http://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/flash-notes/flash-note-can-recent-attacks-really-threaten-internet-availability/at_download/fullReport http://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/flash-notes/flash-note-can-recent-attacks-really-threaten-internet-availability/at_download/fullReport http://www.akamai.com/stateoftheinternet/ https://www.prolexic.com/knowledge-center-ddos-attack-report-2013-q2/pr.html http://arstechnica.com/security/2013/04/fueled-by-super-botnets-ddos-attacks-grow-meaner-and-ever-more-powerful/ http://arstechnica.com/security/2013/04/fueled-by-super-botnets-ddos-attacks-grow-meaner-and-ever-more-powerful/ https://www.securityweek.com/multi-vector-ddos-attacks-grow http://www.arbornetworks.com/corporate/blog/4922-q2-key-findings-from-atlas http://www.arbornetworks.com/corporate/blog/4813-putting-the-spamhouse-ddos-attack-in-perspective http://www.akamai.com/dl/akamai/akamai_soti_q213_exec_summary.pdf http://www.bankinfosecurity.com/ddos-what-to-expect-from-next-attacks-a-5653  ENISA Threat Landscape 2013  Overview of current and emerging cyber-threats  11 December 2013  Page  25  Reconnaissance Weaponisation Delivery Exploitation Installation Command and Control  Actions on Objectives  Denial of Service  Step of Attack Workflow  Width of Purpose  Figure 12: Position of Denial of Service in attack workflow  3.9 Phishing  The hunting of user credentials through phishing continues in 2013. Tools are e-mails, manipulated  web pages, mobile apps and social media/social gaming. Through the proliferation of mobile  devices, they constitute main targets/channels to obtain user credentials. In this context social  engineering approaches target users over various channels supported in mobile devices such as  voice, instant and short messages and rogue apps. These channels come to complement e-mail as  common phishing delivery method89.  The complexity/sophistication of phishing methods varies as well. Fake websites is the simplest tool  going up to infected web sites, malware and Pharming/DNS manipulations90. The range of  complexity allows all threat agent groups, from novice to experts, to launch phishing attacks47. All in  all, there has been an increase in phishing in 2013, with phishing sites targeting mainly Social  Networking, Financial, Online Services, E-Commerce and Gaming90,91(sequence according to number  of phishing sites). Nevertheless, phishing targets vary from country to country90.  In the reporting period we have assessed that:   Sophistication of phishing increases: in the reporting period we have seen phishing strategies to  include methods that are difficult to spot90 by end users. Moreover, phishing strategies seem to  seek for tactics to fool users of multilevel security procedures introduced by targeted  organisations.   Phishing has a geographic component90,91. Phishing strategies are adapted to cultural, social and  technological development of particular geographic areas. Therefore, phishing mitigation  strategies have to take this dimension into account.   As in other threats assessed, phishing can also be facilitated by easy-to-use tools90. This enables  threat agents with low capabilities to launch phishing attacks.   Phishing is heavily based on web site vulnerabilities92. This fact underlines the importance of in-  depth web site/web application protection strategies.   Powerful hosting environments (i.e. cloud computing), are an important target of phishing  attacks. This is due to the multiplication effect of a successfully mounted attack. This strategy  follows the same pattern as for botnets and DoS attacks, all using the power of virtual  environments and the vast accumulation of data92.  89  http://www.emc.com/collateral/fraud-report/online-rsa-fraud-report-012013.pdf, accessed 5 Nov 2013.  90  http://media.kaspersky.com/pdf/Kaspersky_Lab_KSN_report_The_Evolution_of_Phishing_Attacks_2011-2013.pdf,  accessed 5 November 2013.  91  http://www.microsoft.com/security/sir/default.aspx, accessed 5 Nov 2013.  92  http://docs.apwg.org/reports/APWG_GlobalPhishingSurvey_2H2012.pdf, accessed 5 Nov 2013.  http://www.emc.com/collateral/fraud-report/online-rsa-fraud-report-012013.pdf http://media.kaspersky.com/pdf/Kaspersky_Lab_KSN_report_The_Evolution_of_Phishing_Attacks_2011-2013.pdf http://www.microsoft.com/security/sir/default.aspx http://docs.apwg.org/reports/APWG_GlobalPhishingSurvey_2H2012.pdf  ENISA Threat Landscape 2013  Overview of current and emerging cyber-threats  11 December 2013  Page  26   Threat agents will target end users of financial systems directly in order to obtain important  information to perform fraud90 and achieve profits. Hence, end user awareness, sensibilization  and training are the key to protect against this threat.

Not only is filtering spam a resource consuming task;  spam is one important channel to spread malware, attract user to malicious URLs, commit fraud, etc.  Hence, defending against this threat is not all about filtering spam but also how to avoid the impact  on end users with regard to fraud and malicious e-mail content. As originating mainly from botnets,  spam has demonstrated an activity that is in analogy to the botnet activity: in the 1st quarter on 2013  we have experienced a dramatic increase56,93, whereas the volume of spam dropped till the 1st half  of the year91,94. Finally, just like almost all other threats, spam has gone mobile: spam with Android  malware has been on the rise95.  In the reporting period we have assessed that:   Spam has a strong geographic component, with spam origin being on the focus91,96: while in  some areas spam traffic in on decline, there are countries with high/very high spam traffic.   Spam content is related mainly (i.e. over 85%) to pharmacy, images, the so called “Nigerian  scam”97, malware and non-pharmacy product ads91. Moreover, spam messages chose  contemporary hot topics from the press to attract potential victims98 (e.g. Boston Marathon  bombings, Pope Francis election, etc.). This might be an important piece of information for end  users.   Tricks used in spam/scam are identity theft targeting social accounts. This is being attempted  either by means of luring potential victims through prizes/gifts, or by using fake websites to  convince them to enter credential information99.  93  http://www.commtouch.com/uploads/2013/04/Commtouch-Internet-Threats-Trend-Report-2013-April.pdf, accessed 6  Nov 2013.  94  http://www.commtouch.com/uploads/pdf/Commtouch-Internet-Threats-Trend-Report-Q3-2013.pdf, accessed 7 Nov  2013.  95  http://www.f-secure.com/static/doc/labs_global/Research/Mobile_Threat_Report_Q1_2013.pdf, accessed 6 Nov 2013.  96  https://www.ibm.com/services/forms/signup.do?source=swg- WW_Security_Organic&S_PKG=ov16986&S_TACT=102PW63W, accessed 6 Nov 2013.  97  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigerian_scam, accessed 6 Nov 2013.  98  http://www.commtouch.com/uploads/2013/04/Commtouch-Internet-Threats-Trend-Report-2013-April.pdf, accessed 6  Nov 2013.  99  http://www.symantec.com/security_response/publications/threatreport.jsp, accessed 6 Nov 2013.  http://www.commtouch.com/uploads/2013/04/Commtouch-Internet-Threats-Trend-Report-2013-April.pdf http://www.commtouch.com/uploads/pdf/Commtouch-Internet-Threats-Trend-Report-Q3-2013.pdf http://www.f-secure.com/static/doc/labs_global/Research/Mobile_Threat_Report_Q1_2013.pdf https://www.ibm.com/services/forms/signup.do?source=swg-WW_Security_Organic&S_PKG=ov16986&S_TACT=102PW63W https://www.ibm.com/services/forms/signup.do?source=swg-WW_Security_Organic&S_PKG=ov16986&S_TACT=102PW63W http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigerian_scam http://www.commtouch.com/uploads/2013/04/Commtouch-Internet-Threats-Trend-Report-2013-April.pdf http://www.symantec.com/security_response/publications/threatreport.jsp  ENISA Threat Landscape 2013  Overview of current and emerging cyber-threats  11 December 2013  Page  27   It seems that spammers are checking regularly the capability/performance of existing spam  filters. In the reporting period we have seen spams that have obviously no malicious  background, have strange content and/or structure98,100.   The techniques of spammers evolve. For end users it is important to understand tricks101 and  have basic sensitivity/awareness on this matter.

Rogue security software, ransomware  and scareware are malicious pieces of software - distributed by threat agents - to terrify/blackmail  users, thus demanding ransom payments. Although a decline has been reported regarding the  number of fake Anti-Virus (AV) products in comparison to 2012, the overall numbers of  rogueware/ransomeare/Scareware remain high56,102,103. In particular, ransomware has reached high  levels of infection104. Despite recent law enforcement advances105, the reports analysed provide  strong evidence that there is an increase in ransomware threat104. One reason for the growth is the  expansion of ransomware and fake Antivirus distribution to mobile platforms, such as Android106.  Again, one significant component of the increase registered related to mobile platforms:  ransomware (i.e. FakeAV) has hit this year Android104,107,108.  In the reporting period we have assessed that:   The availability of anonymous payment services to channel illegal profits obtained from this  threat is a key enabler for this kind of fraud109.   Rogueware, ransomware and scareware are distributed via exploit kits, while exploiting Java and  Adobe vulnerabilities. The use of exploit kits (see also description of exploit kits threat above), is  100  http://www.spiegel.de/netzwelt/web/e-mail-provider-gmx-und-co-der-raetselhafte-buchstaben-spam-a-931933.html,  accessed 6 Nov 2013.  101  http://www.appriver.com/downloads/global-threatscape-reports/2013/GlobalThreatScapeReport_6MonthEdition.pdf,  accessed 6 Nov 2013.  102  http://www.kindsight.net/sites/default/files/Kindsight-Q2-2013-Malware-Report.pdf, accessed 6 Nov 2013.  103  http://www.itproportal.com/2013/04/10/ransomware-the-cybercrime-money-machine-of-2013/, accessed 19 Nov  2013.  104  https://www.us-cert.gov/ncas/alerts/TA13-309A, accessed 18 Nov 2013.  105  https://www.europol.europa.eu/content/police-dismantle-prolific-ransomware-cybercriminal-network, accessed 8  August 2013.  106  https://www.infoworld.com/t/mobile-security/ransomware-android-it-was-only-matter-of-time-221285, accessed 8  August 2013.  107  http://www.symantec.com/connect/blogs/fakeav-holds-android-phones-ransom, accessed 6 Nov 2013.  108  http://blog.fortinet.com/Ransomware/, accessed 6 Nov 2013.  109  http://www.mcafee.com/us/resources/reports/rp-quarterly-threat-q1-2013.pdf, accessed 8 August 2013.  http://www.spiegel.de/netzwelt/web/e-mail-provider-gmx-und-co-der-raetselhafte-buchstaben-spam-a-931933.html http://www.appriver.com/downloads/global-threatscape-reports/2013/GlobalThreatScapeReport_6MonthEdition.pdf http://www.kindsight.net/sites/default/files/Kindsight-Q2-2013-Malware-Report.pdf http://www.itproportal.com/2013/04/10/ransomware-the-cybercrime-money-machine-of-2013/ https://www.us-cert.gov/ncas/alerts/TA13-309A https://www.europol.europa.eu/content/police-dismantle-prolific-ransomware-cybercriminal-network https://www.infoworld.com/t/mobile-security/ransomware-android-it-was-only-matter-of-time-221285 http://www.symantec.com/connect/blogs/fakeav-holds-android-phones-ransom http://blog.fortinet.com/Ransomware/ http://www.mcafee.com/us/resources/reports/rp-quarterly-threat-q1-2013.pdf  ENISA Threat Landscape 2013  Overview of current and emerging cyber-threats  11 December 2013  Page  28  concluded from the wide spread and the existence of variations/derivates of this malware, that  is, alternations to some initial code performed by individual threat agents110 .   Just as it is the case with the rest of malware, the sophistication of ransomware increases111,112 .   In the reporting period a significant success of law enforcement led to arrest of members of  cyber-criminal gang responsible for the “Police Virus” (statement of the Spanish Ministry of  Interior113 ).

With this threat, we refer to loss  of data occurring via intentional or unintentional information disclosure (i.e. through mistakes in  managing information assets). This threat might originate from internal threat agents or external  ones. In both cases there might have both hostile116 and non-hostile intentions (i.e. lack of  knowledge or negligence). As regards intentional causes, this threat is rather a cumulative  implication of other threats mentioned in this report on data. The unintentional part of it, however,  is a threat that can materialize due to errors and mistakes of personnel. In all cases, data breaches  are systematically reported in related publications. Data breaches are related to incidents from  materialized threats, whereby information has been compromised. As such, data breach reporting is  considered to be an important indicator of the protection level for company data, but also the  effectiveness of malicious actions117. This information is useful for decision and policy makers,  especially from the economic point of view118.

Larger organisations  are targeted merely with the intention of espionage119. This might be indicative for the  quality/quantity of protection measures. Eventually, larger organisations are better off in  protecting themselves against more simple kinds of attacks, while they often become victims of  highly skilled organised crime.   As regards data breaches, internal actors are at the minority. The vast amount of data breaches  are attributed to external threat agents119. This is reflected in a study on the costs of data  breaches: malicious attacks are at the first position, while system failure and human factor score  second and third respectively118.   Data breach reporting is an important tool for the evaluation of effectiveness/maturity of  existing controls. Data breach notification mechanisms are envisaged from policy makers as an  instrument towards better cyber security governance120.   Through the deployment of simple/low cost security controls organisations may drastically  reduce data breaches: over 70% of incidents are based on simple/low difficulty attacks.   Most of misuse actions are caused by physical access, either directly or indirectly to the asset  targeted.

Moreover, unsecured file transfers might lead to severe information leakage65, as  well as poor encryption practices for mobile devices.  119  http://www.verizonenterprise.com/resources/reports/rp_data-breach-investigations-report-2013_en_xg.pdf, accessed  5 Nov 2013.  120  http://www.computerweekly.com/news/2240203760/EU-data-breach-disclosures-to-be-enforced-soon, accessed 5  Nov 2013.  121  http://www.trendmicro.co.uk/cloud-content/us/pdfs/security-intelligence/reports/rpt-zero-days-hit-users-hard-at-the- start-of-the-year.pdf, accessed 8 Nov 2013.  122  https://blog.lookout.com/blog/2013/06/05/world-current-of-mobile-threats/, accessed 8 Nov 2013.  http://www.verizonenterprise.com/resources/reports/rp_data-breach-investigations-report-2013_en_xg.pdf http://www.computerweekly.com/news/2240203760/EU-data-breach-disclosures-to-be-enforced-soon http://www.trendmicro.co.uk/cloud-content/us/pdfs/security-intelligence/reports/rpt-zero-days-hit-users-hard-at-the-start-of-the-year.pdf http://www.trendmicro.co.uk/cloud-content/us/pdfs/security-intelligence/reports/rpt-zero-days-hit-users-hard-at-the-start-of-the-year.pdf https://blog.lookout.com/blog/2013/06/05/world-current-of-mobile-threats/  ENISA Threat Landscape 2013  Overview of current and emerging cyber-threats  11 December 2013  Page  30  In the reporting period we have assessed that:   Broken authentication and session management has the consequence that attackers may hijack  user sessions, gain user credentials and obtain access to business transactions. This is based on  leakage from bad session management123.   Directory traversal is a threat that has been already mentioned in code injection (see above).  Path manipulation124 and resource injection125 are attacks based on directory information  leakage.   Network reconnaissance126,127 is a known, yet very important information gaining method/attack  to obtain system, network and other resources. Network reconnaissance is based on leakage of  network structure and is an important part of targeted attacks. Besides networks, availability of  information on other resources may facilitate all kinds of attacks128.   Due to user negligence but also maturity level of available apps, big parts of mobile  communication take place unsecured, often over unsecured channels. This can lead to  significant information leakage including personal and business information65.   Research with support of social media can be a very effective way to obtain information on  human resources. Widely available services on the web129 allow for identification of further  personal details which, when combined with additional information may result in significant  knowledge about targeted individuals.   Although not explicitly a leakage issue, it is worth mentioning cloud services (e.g. cross VM side  channels) as a potential to abuse computing power, data concentration and extract sensitive  data130,131.

Targeted  attacks are further characterised by the capability level and dedication of the threat agent deploying  the attack: all of the (successful) attacks reported in 2013 have been performed by threat agents  with assumedly large resources132. Another important observation in the reporting period is a shift  of APT targets from financial institutions to politically motivated targets such as NGOs, governmental  organisations, politically active groups, etc133,134.  In the reporting period we have assessed that:   2013 has been characterised by numerous APT attakcs, whereas it has become clear that one  should not assume only a few rogue states as main originators of targeted attacks. There are  quite some nation states that have developed sufficient capabilities and infrastructure to  successfully launch targeted attacks that can be used to infiltrate all kinds of targets.   In 2013, targeted attacks demonstrated their true potential. In particular, cyber espionage  attacks using targeted attack campaigns reached dimensions that went far beyond  expectations135,136.   With recent advances in mobile threats such as malware, code injection, scam/spam, etc.,  mobile platforms have become an important attack surface for targeted attacks95,137. It is worth  mentioning that mobile spyware applications might become strong tools for APTs targeting Bring  Your Own Device environments138.   Targeted attacks are applied as a pressure instrument at multiple levels. Concrete examples in  the reporting period of successful attacks to notable social media accounts96,139 have shown the  potential towards the materialisation of risks similar to “Digital Wild Fires in a Hyper-connected  World”140.   Sophistication, complexity and stealthiness of targeted attacks are state-of-the-art in cyber-  attack techniques141. Prevention from such attacks is a complex task that has to embrace all  levels of organisational assets, from technology to processes to people. The defence has to be  prepared and implemented as orchestrated as the attack itself.

When visiting a manipulated web site,  devices of members of the target group get eventually infected142.  Although already mentioned in 2012, in the reporting period this threat has significantly increased  and led to several successful attacks targeting high tech companies143,144, but also governmental  organisations 145 . Though relatively low in number, these attacks have demonstrated the  effectiveness of this threat as it has hit companies who are at the leading edge of technology. Hence,  it is alarming that when targeting lower tech users, such attacks will be at least equally successful!  This has created a lot of awareness in the threat analysts’ community47, especially due to the fact  that such attacks are usually launched within more extensive targeted attacks.  In the reporting period we have assessed that:   Information about surfing habits are tracked via tracking services as the ones used by marketing  companies to collect data. By tracking users of a specific company, it is possible to find web sites  that are frequently used by groups of people. Obviously, these web sites are the best candidates  to infect146.   Watering hole attacks have some commonalities with search engine poisoning (SEP): attracting  potential victims to visit an infected web site based on their interests. However, watering hole  attacks are more effective especially when attackers want to focus to a specific user group.   It is worth mentioning that watering hole attacks are more a method to downsize the effort of  threat agents while being more successful: fewer web site infections do more effectively reach  target victim group. Otherwise, the methods used for victim infection are the ones mentioned  above (drive-by downloads, exploit kits, malware).   It is expected that deployments of this type of threat will increase in the future147. It might be  meaningful if owners of infected web sites inform their visitors. At the end, every web site is a  “water hole” of some user group.  Observed current trend for this threat: increasing  Related threats: Drive-by Downloads, Exploit Kits, Code Injection, Worms/Trojans.  142  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watering_Hole, accessed 3 Dec 2013.  143  http://threatpost.com/why-watering-hole-attacks-work-032013/77647, accessed 8 Nov 2013.  144  http://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/monitors/ICS-MM201306, accessed 8 Nov 2013.  145  http://www.darkreading.com/attacks-breaches/us-department-of-labor-website-discovere/240153967, accessed 8 Nov  2013.  146  https://blog.cloudsecurityalliance.org/2013/09/23/watering-hole-attacks-protecting-yourself-from-the-latest-craze-in- cyber-attacks/, accessed 8 Nov 2013.  147  http://blog.fortinet.com/Security-101--Watering-Hole-Attacks/, accessed 19 Nov 2013.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watering_Hole http://threatpost.com/why-watering-hole-attacks-work-032013/77647 http://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/monitors/ICS-MM201306 http://www.darkreading.com/attacks-breaches/us-department-of-labor-website-discovere/240153967 https://blog.cloudsecurityalliance.org/2013/09/23/watering-hole-attacks-protecting-yourself-from-the-latest-craze-in-cyber-attacks/ https://blog.cloudsecurityalliance.org/2013/09/23/watering-hole-attacks-protecting-yourself-from-the-latest-craze-in-cyber-attacks/ http://blog.fortinet.com/Security-101--Watering-Hole-Attacks/  ENISA Threat Landscape 2013  Overview of current and emerging cyber-threats  11 December 2013  Page  33  Reconnaissance Weaponisation Delivery Exploitation Installation Command and Control  Actions on Objectives  Watering Hole  Step of Attack Workflow  Width of Purpose  Figure 19: Position of Watering Hole in attack workflow  3.16 Visualising changes in the current threat landscape  As expected, in comparison with 2012 there have been changes in the current threat landscape.

Firstly, it should be mentioned that in 2013 more elaborated/qualitative descriptions have  been found on this topic148,149. Moreover, through relevant publications150,151,152,153,154 details about  incidents and potential attacks caused by each particular threat agent group have been published.  All in all, in comparison to 2013 a better and more concise coverage of threat agents in the causal  chain of attacks has been assessed. This is definitely an advancement compared to 2012.  The above developments support a better description of threat agents, including profiles, motives  capabilities, etc. While the threat agents from ETL 2012 still remain relevant, the details assessed  this year provide the basis for a more elaborated description. In addition, two new threat agents  groups have been added, script kiddies and cyber fighters.  In particular, the major threat agents identified are as follows:  Corporations: The objective of corporations is mainly the creation of competitive advantages.  Hence, corporations may act as hostile threat agents when involved in activities to: collect business  intelligence, to breach intellectual property rights, to gather confidential information on  competitors, to be engaged in intelligence gathering connected to bids, etc. Generally speaking,  corporations may be involved in reconnaissance activities, intrusion and data breach. Corporations  may engage salaried threat agents from other groups to achieve their objectives. Depending on their  size, sector and level of engagement in high-tech areas and secrecy levels corporations may possess  significant cyber capabilities to perform malicious activities towards achieving their objectives. In  such cases, corporations may use sophisticated targeted attacks to infiltrate their victims.  Nation States: 2013 has clearly unveiled the true dimension behind the potential of this threat agent  group. In the reporting period it has become clear, that cyber activities are not a matter of one-two  nation states. Rather, multiple nation states have developed capabilities that can be used to  infiltrate all kinds of targets both governmental and private in order to achieve their objectives. Main  targets of this threat agent group are state secrets, military secrets, data on intelligence, as well as  threatening the availability of critical infrastructures. Acting with a high level of capabilities, the  methods/vectors of launched attacks vary significantly. Yet, high effort and high sophistication  targeted attacks belong to the main attack methods used. The degree of successfulness of  performed attacks can be considered as rather high.  Hacktivists: Hacktivists is a threat agent group that has enjoyed great media attention, particularly in  2011155 and to some extend 2012. Hacktivists are ideologically motivated individuals that can  dynamically form groups/subgroups, usually lacking a central organisation structure. Their main  148  https://www.ncsc.nl/english/current-topics/news/cyber-security-assesment-netherlands.html, accessed 30 Oct 2013.  149  http://www.ark-group.com/Downloads/Cybercrime-Threats-and-Solutions-Sample1.pdf, accessed 16 Oct 2013.  150  http://www.freedomfromfearmagazine.org/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=302:hackers-profiling- who-are-the-attackers&catid=50:issue-7&Itemid=187, accessed 16 Oct 2013.  151  http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/apr/29/hacking-guardian-syria-background, accessed 16 Oct 2013.  152  http://www.verizonenterprise.com/DBIR/2013/, accessed 16 Oct 2013.  153  http://owasptop10.googlecode.com/files/OWASP%20Top%2010%20-%202013.pdf, accessed 16 Oct 2013.  154  http://www.kpmg.com/Global/en/IssuesAndInsights/ArticlesPublications/global-profiles-of-the- fraudster/Documents/global-profiles-of-the-fraudster-v2.pdf, accessed 2 Dec 2013.  155  http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2011/12/2011-hactivist-verizon/, accessed 30 Oct 2013.  https://www.ncsc.nl/english/current-topics/news/cyber-security-assesment-netherlands.html http://www.ark-group.com/Downloads/Cybercrime-Threats-and-Solutions-Sample1.pdf http://www.freedomfromfearmagazine.org/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=302:hackers-profiling-who-are-the-attackers&catid=50:issue-7&Itemid=187 http://www.freedomfromfearmagazine.org/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=302:hackers-profiling-who-are-the-attackers&catid=50:issue-7&Itemid=187 http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/apr/29/hacking-guardian-syria-background http://www.verizonenterprise.com/DBIR/2013/ http://owasptop10.googlecode.com/files/OWASP%20Top%2010%20-%202013.pdf http://www.kpmg.com/Global/en/IssuesAndInsights/ArticlesPublications/global-profiles-of-the-fraudster/Documents/global-profiles-of-the-fraudster-v2.pdf http://www.kpmg.com/Global/en/IssuesAndInsights/ArticlesPublications/global-profiles-of-the-fraudster/Documents/global-profiles-of-the-fraudster-v2.pdf http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2011/12/2011-hactivist-verizon/  ENISA Threat Landscape 2013  Overview of current and emerging cyber-threats  11 December 2013  Page  37  motivation is usually the defence of ideas that are sometime manifested148. Due to the dynamics  behind this group, it is difficult to shape a sharp profile for this group: in some cases, threat agents of  other groups – e.g. script kiddies - join hacktivists activities in order to co-protest or to serve other  purposes (e.g. express their sympathy, perform knowledge transfer, provide tools, etc.). Targets of  hacktivists are selected in such a way, that media attention to successful cyber-attacks create high  visibility (e.g. government sites, big companies, media, public and private infrastructure  components, etc.). It is common that breached data are published to embarrass victims and achieve  desired public attention. Although not considered to possess average capabilities, due to group  dynamics and media visibility, hacktivists may achieve severe impact.  Cyber Terrorists: yet controversially discussed, this group is mainly used to attribute potential  threats to cyber-targets that will harm national security and society156. As a matter of fact, only  minor incidents have been documented. Officials speak about some attacks that are being kept  confidential157. Characteristic of this threat agent group is the indiscriminate use of violence in order  to influence decisions/actions of states towards their politically or relationally motivated objectives.  Activities of this threat group are mostly impact oriented and may affect or harm large parts of  society, just to generate necessary pressure. Cyber terrorists may use technology both as the means  and target of their attacks, while critical infrastructures comprise one of the main targets158. Further  targets of this group may be traffic control, military infrastructures159, government systems, etc.  Information collection, reconnaissance and social engineering are methods that may belong to the  key capabilities of this group, while access to high tech tools and methods are also considered within  their capabilities, especially due to blurring lines between this and other threat agent groups160.  Cybercriminals: This threat agent group is the most widely known as its objective is to obtain profit  from illegal/criminal activities in the cyberspace. Cybercriminals act mainly in the cyberspace and so  do their victims. Hence, cybercriminals are involved in fraud regarding all kinds of e-finance, e- commerce, e-payment, ransomware, cybercrime-as-a-service, delivery and development of  malicious tools and infrastructures. It should be noted, that in this group we do not consider  individuals involved in a “traditional” crime using IT to facilitate their criminal activity.  Cybercriminals have high capabilities in performing their tasks, can be globally interconnected161 and  may easily obtain access to the means needed for their hostile activities. By taking as given that this  group possesses significant monetary resources, it should be considered as being in the position to  occupy additional workforce in order to enhance capabilities162.  Although essentially belonging to the group of cybercriminals group, we discriminate between users  and providers/developers/operators of malware, botnets and other kinds of malicious cyber-tools.  It is considered that those who develop, deliver and operate malicious infrastructures are the most  skilled among all cyber threat agents and as such they have the highest cyber striking power from all  other threat agent groups considered. Nevertheless, one can assume that they mainly provide the  means for attacks (i.e. services/tools) to other cybercriminals and they may not be actively involved  in fraudulent activities.  156  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyberterrorism, accessed 3 Dec 2013.  157  http://www.psmag.com/politics/nsa-really-stopping-terrorist-plots-70159/, accessed 3 Dec 2013.  158  http://www.timesofisrael.com/internet-cable-cutters-caught-by-egypt-signal-new-terror-threat/, accessed 16 Oct 2013  159  http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2013/09/04/world/al-qaida-hopes-to-sabotage-destroy-drones/, accessed 16 Oct  2013  160  http://cryptome.org/2013/04/terrorist-hackers.htm, accessed 16 Oct 2013  161  http://www.f-secure.com/static/doc/labs_global/Research/Threat_Report_H1_2013.pdf, accessed 16 Oct 2013.  162  http://www.smh.com.au/technology/technology-news/silk-road-mastermind-ross-william-ulbricht-tripped-up-by- careless-online-mistake-20131003-2utky.html, accessed 16 Oct 2013.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyberterrorism http://www.psmag.com/politics/nsa-really-stopping-terrorist-plots-70159/ http://www.timesofisrael.com/internet-cable-cutters-caught-by-egypt-signal-new-terror-threat/ http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2013/09/04/world/al-qaida-hopes-to-sabotage-destroy-drones/ http://cryptome.org/2013/04/terrorist-hackers.htm http://www.f-secure.com/static/doc/labs_global/Research/Threat_Report_H1_2013.pdf http://www.smh.com.au/technology/technology-news/silk-road-mastermind-ross-william-ulbricht-tripped-up-by-careless-online-mistake-20131003-2utky.html http://www.smh.com.au/technology/technology-news/silk-road-mastermind-ross-william-ulbricht-tripped-up-by-careless-online-mistake-20131003-2utky.html  ENISA Threat Landscape 2013  Overview of current and emerging cyber-threats  11 December 2013  Page  38  Cyber Fighters: Cyber fighters are groups of nationally motivated citizens. This is an emerging  phenomenon where patriotic motivated groups of citizens bear the potential to launch cyber-attacks  in a coordinated manner163. Such groups might have strong feelings when their political, national or  religious values seem to be threatened by another group and are capable of launching cyber- attacks164. One can argue that such groups are special cases of Hacktivism (i.e. an evolution or yet  another instance). To certain extent, such groups may be supporters of totalitarian regimes and,  rightly or wrongly, act on behalf of their supporting parties (i.e. governments) by contributing to  national activities in the cyber-space165. Their activities may include conflicts with other groups (i.e.  other hacktivists). Depending on their number and capabilities, such groups may form a considerable  striking power. They can be considered as underground cyber fighters in support of the interests of a  nation state166.  Script Kiddies: “As more young people learn to code, more will learn to hack”167. This statement  indicates the birth site of hackers. This is when young individuals get thrilled about achievements  and skills of tech savvy individuals who assumedly gave a lesson to persons, organisations or brands  considered outrageous. Despite being in a self-discovery phase and technically novice, due to their  large number, script kiddies are susceptive to external influences from other threat agent groups, in  particular cyber criminals and hacktivists. On the other hand, due to reduced knowledge about both  the use of hacking tools and the consequences of their activities, script kiddies may achieve great  impact. Typically this threat agent group is engaged in DDoS and code injection attacks149. Script  kiddies may also form ad-hoc groups with common targets and develop to a considerable striking  power168.  Online Social Hackers: there is an increasing significance of social engineering as element of cyber- attack pattern169. Therefore this threat agent group plays a key role when deploying cyber threats.  These online social hackers are skilled with social engineering knowledge, are in the position to  analyse and understand behaviour and psychology of social targets and to generate false trust  relationships. Even if not necessarily using high-tech methodologies and tools, activities of this  threat agent group may cause significant impact especially in areas of identity theft, collection of  confidential personal data, user credentials, cyber bullying, etc170. The capabilities of this group can  be characterised as low to medium as regards the use of technology. However their social  engineering skills might be quite high. With increasing use of social networking, it is expected that  the importance of this group in cyber-attacks will grow in the future.  Employees: this group is the one behind the insider threat that often scores within the top 10 cyber  threats171,172. This threat agent group (or also widely referred to as “internal actors”148), can be staff,  contractors, operational staff, former employees, etc. The reasons for acting within threat agent  group may vary significantly, i.e. lax handling of security procedures, user error or even malicious  intent. This threat group is usually equipped with low to medium-tech methods and tools. However,  due to graded access rights to all kinds of assets of an organisation, they might cause significant  163  http://krebsonsecurity.com/2013/06/iranian-elections-bring-lull-in-bank-attacks/, accessed 29 Nov 2013.  164  http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2313652/AP-Twitter-hackers-break-news-White-House-explosions-injured- Obama.html, accessed 16 Oct 2013.  165  http://www.mcafee.com/us/resources/white-papers/wp-hacktivism.pdf, accessed 16 Oct 2013.  166  http://mashable.com/2012/08/10/syrian-electronic-army/, accessed 16 Oct 2013.  167  http://www.fastcolabs.com/3013102/why-the-script-kiddie-next-door-is-just-as-dangerous-as-a-chinese-government- hacker, accessed 16 Oct 2013.  168  http://www.cnhinews.com/wpbloom/x862178305/Teens-hone-hacking-skills-in-contests, accessed 16 Oct 2013  169  http://public.tableausoftware.com/views/VERISCommunity/SummaryofActions#1, accessed 16 Oct 2013.  170  http://resources.infosecinstitute.com/social-engineering-a-hacking-story/, accessed 16 Oct 2013.  171  https://cloudsecurityalliance.org/research/top-threats/, accessed 16 Oct 2013.  172  http://www.red-book.eu/, accessed 16 Oct 2013.  http://krebsonsecurity.com/2013/06/iranian-elections-bring-lull-in-bank-attacks/ http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2313652/AP-Twitter-hackers-break-news-White-House-explosions-injured-Obama.html http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2313652/AP-Twitter-hackers-break-news-White-House-explosions-injured-Obama.html http://www.mcafee.com/us/resources/white-papers/wp-hacktivism.pdf http://mashable.com/2012/08/10/syrian-electronic-army/ http://www.fastcolabs.com/3013102/why-the-script-kiddie-next-door-is-just-as-dangerous-as-a-chinese-government-hacker http://www.fastcolabs.com/3013102/why-the-script-kiddie-next-door-is-just-as-dangerous-as-a-chinese-government-hacker http://www.cnhinews.com/wpbloom/x862178305/Teens-hone-hacking-skills-in-contests http://public.tableausoftware.com/views/VERISCommunity/SummaryofActions#1 http://resources.infosecinstitute.com/social-engineering-a-hacking-story/ https://cloudsecurityalliance.org/research/top-threats/ http://www.red-book.eu/  ENISA Threat Landscape 2013  Overview of current and emerging cyber-threats  11 December 2013  Page  39  damage, especially when having malicious intent. Dissatisfaction, frustration, dissent or corruption  are common causes behind malicious behaviour of this threat agent group.  The above mentioned threat agents are a consolidated form of the significant ones mentioned in  relevant publications. Yet the list is not exhaustive: depending on particular incidents, viewpoints  and scope, additional groups are being considered. Besides this fact, and given the often blurry lines  between legitimate cyber agents and hostile ones, cases where “camp changes” take place have  been reported. In other words, bad guys might be engaged within state or company sponsored  efforts173 and good guys may serve hostile tasks174.  In order to give an overview of existing agents/actors acting in cyber space - both hostile and friendly  - a taxonomy of cyber agents has been developed (see Figure 20). It should be noted, that the threat  agents mentioned in this chapter are depicted in the figure through the right hand branch,  annotated as Hostile Cyber Agent, whereas the left hand branch of it stays for other agents who  serve friendly tasks in cyber space.  The purpose of this figure is to deliver information on agents/actors acting in cyber space such as  motive, capability or areas of engagement. Furthermore, this figure may be used in order to  follow/comprehend eventual interactions among the different groups, such as possible “camp  changes”, concurrent roles or other interactions among them. Drawing these kinds of possible  interdependencies on demand, may facilitate the work of security experts willing to understand  possible interactions among these groups and thus better assess the capabilities behind asserted  threat agents.

The purpose of this table is to visualize which threat  agent groups use which threats. The target group of this information are individuals who wish to  assess possible threat agent involvement in the deployment of threats. This information might be  useful when assessing which capability level can be assumed behind the top threats and thus  support in decisions concerning the strength of the implemented security measures.  As already stated, overlaps among the threat agent groups do exist. This is reflected in the table by  eventual similarities in the way of threat deployment.

The content  of this chapter constitutes the Emerging Threat Landscape. The information presented has been  assessed by the analysis of relevant material. Both threat trends and emerging technology areas  have been either directly mentioned or have been implicitly assessed from the analysed material.  Threat trend identification by means of emerging technology areas is an approach that has also been  followed in ETL 2012. It aims at establishing the context between threats and various technology  areas that will undergo significant development in the near future (i.e. coming year). By mapping  threats to emerging developments, future/emerging trends within the threat landscape are being  captured.  Within ETL 2013, all of the areas addressed in 2012 have been maintained, as they still represent the  state-of-the-art in IT technology development. As such they are of paramount importance for a large  group of stakeholders from both public and private sectors. Last year’s list has been expanded with  one “newcomer”, the Internet of Things. Whilst it is not a new area in cyber-security, this area is  considered by analysts as an innovative field that has reached a maturity enabling its entrance to the  market.  It is worth mentioning, that in the reporting period ENISA has performed specific/detailed  assessments in the areas of Critical Infrastructures and Trust Infrastructures; assessments regarding  threat and risk exposure of smart grids and the use of e-ID in financial sector have been performed  and are going to be available as autonomous ENISA deliverables. The presented information  regarding these two areas is a summary of the work conducted in these ENISA projects.  In particular, the emerging technology areas considered are:   Critical Infrastructures: Critical infrastructures are a vital part of society and national sovereignty.  The security of critical infrastructure will remain high priority for governments and big operators.   Mobile Computing: Besides cloud computing and Internet of Things, mobile computing is  another major trend that has changed traditional IT architecture. Mobile computing has made  digital convergence to reality and has caused a revolution in application development. This area  it is going to continue being a platform for innovations.   Social Networking: The paradigm of interconnected individuals, professionals and knowledge is  one of the major social phenomena of recent years. Social media have already penetrated the  lives of a significant part of online users. This development is going to continue for the years to  come.   Cloud Computing: Cloud computing is an integral counterpart of the current internet  architecture. Besides storage, it increasingly accommodates application services by thus  innovating commercial IT operations. Cloud computing also embraces the promise of a more  effective implementation of security mechanisms by leveraging on economies of scale.   Trust Infrastructure: Trust infrastructures and authentication infrastructure in particular is the  spine of cyber-security. Attacks, but also technology and implementation issues hereof are  important elements of every cyber-security assessment. It is expected that this area will retain  its central role for the future.   Big Data: The role of big data for security has worried security professionals for quite some time  now. In the reporting period, big data has been the subject of vivid discussions after revelations  on industrial espionage and state sponsored surveillance activities. Through the proliferation of  mobile and smart devices, big data is going to be for quite some time in the future on the focus  of cyber-security professionals and cyber-criminals alike.   Interconnected Devices – Internet of Things: Inter- and hyper-connected devices form the future  of internet: the Internet of Things. Low cost devices form an interconnected community to  ENISA Threat Landscape 2013  Overview of current and emerging cyber-threats  11 December 2013  Page  43  provide smart consumer services in many areas, such as smart houses, e-health, industrial  control systems, energy, cars, transportation, etc. Alike the other areas, the Internet of Things  will be the main source of technological innovations and challenges in the years to come.  It is obvious that these areas are not completely independent or overlap free. Developments in one  area may include aspects of others (i.e. technology, components, functions). However, splitting  threat trends according to those areas allows for a better establishment of the context of each  threat and helps assessing and understanding trends.  In the following sections a short discussion with the highlights of each particular area is given prior  to the emerging threat and trends assessed. In addition to the emerging threats, for each area we  provide a number of important issues regarding developments/challenges in cyber-security that are  seen as relevant for the particular area. Just as in the current threat landscape, the sequence of  presentation of the emerging threats is a prediction of the overall frequency of the threat  materialization (i.e. more frequent threats appear first). For each area, the top 10 threats have been  assessed, expect in the area of Internet of Things, where only 9 emerging threats were identified.  When applicable, references to resources indicate the sources used for the assessment. These  sources can be used by interested readers in order to find more extensive information about the  corresponding topic. In the following discussions, trends issued in the reporting period have been  accommodated176,177.  5.1 Threat Trends in Critical Infrastructures  This area is key for society and national security. Critical Infrastructure and their main components  Industrial Control Systems (ICS) have and are still considered as main potential targets of highly  capable threat agent groups, namely terrorists and nation states. Due to their complexity, critical  infrastructures are complex systems and so is their protection. One can take as given that availability  of critical infrastructure is the most important property to maintain. This sheds the right light to the  exposure but also the difficulty of protection of such infrastructures. Finally, critical infrastructures  and ICSs are considered within strategic priorities for cyber-security by various actors178,179,180.  In the reporting period, ENISA has delivered a dedicated threat landscape in the area of smart grids.  As a matter of fact, smart grids are an ideal representative in the area of critical infrastructures:  being a very complex system combining both legacy and innovative systems; and playing a key role  for energy distribution in the years to come. As in many complex systems, smart grids consist of a  variety of components ranging from high end monitoring and control systems up to low cost end- user devices. These systems grow gradually by using a variety of communication protocols,  applications and devices all being at a different maturity level both from the technology and security  utilization point of view. Hence, the main cause of threat exposure in this area emerges from the  technological diversity, component integration, coordination level and cyber security preparedness  176  For a comprehensive summary of issues trends please visit: http://www.zdnet.com/cybersecurity-in-2014-a-roundup- of-predictions-7000023729/, accessed 3 December 2013.  177  https://www.bsi.bund.de/SharedDocs/Downloads/DE/BSI/Publikationen/Lageberichte/Fokus_IT- Sicherheit_2013_nbf.pdf;jsessionid=9CFAC1176CDDA96ACA5DB0EF7AA77882.2_cid359?__blob=publicationFile,  accessed 3 December 2013.  178  http://www.red-book.eu/, accessed 20 Nov 2013.  179  http://www.gtsecuritysummit.com/2014Report.pdf, accessed 20 Nov 2013.  180  https://www.ncsc.nl/binaries/en/current-topics/news/cyber-security-assesment- netherlands/1/Cyber%2BSecurity%2BAssessment%2BNetherlands.pdf, accessed 20 Nov 2013.  http://www.zdnet.com/cybersecurity-in-2014-a-roundup-of-predictions-7000023729/ http://www.zdnet.com/cybersecurity-in-2014-a-roundup-of-predictions-7000023729/ https://www.bsi.bund.de/SharedDocs/Downloads/DE/BSI/Publikationen/Lageberichte/Fokus_IT-Sicherheit_2013_nbf.pdf;jsessionid=9CFAC1176CDDA96ACA5DB0EF7AA77882.2_cid359?__blob=publicationFile https://www.bsi.bund.de/SharedDocs/Downloads/DE/BSI/Publikationen/Lageberichte/Fokus_IT-Sicherheit_2013_nbf.pdf;jsessionid=9CFAC1176CDDA96ACA5DB0EF7AA77882.2_cid359?__blob=publicationFile http://www.red-book.eu/ http://www.gtsecuritysummit.com/2014Report.pdf https://www.ncsc.nl/binaries/en/current-topics/news/cyber-security-assesment-netherlands/1/Cyber%2BSecurity%2BAssessment%2BNetherlands.pdf https://www.ncsc.nl/binaries/en/current-topics/news/cyber-security-assesment-netherlands/1/Cyber%2BSecurity%2BAssessment%2BNetherlands.pdf  ENISA Threat Landscape 2013  Overview of current and emerging cyber-threats  11 December 2013  Page  44  of the actors involved in the supply chain. Known incidents in the reporting period show that the  energy grid is one of the main targets of cyber-criminals181.

Besides this kind of vulnerabilities, it seems that there is a lack of  available information vulnerabilities related to CII infrastructures, scenarios and components. It  is expected that in the near future capabilities for building up and testing of such scenarios will  be developed182.   Words matter: it is important to develop and maintain terms and definitions. Besides serving as  a basis for experts, such a vocabulary would be necessary in the area of crisis management  regarding smart gird, but also other areas of CIIP: it emerges from the necessity to bridge  engineering and cyber security terms183,184.   It seems to be very important to elaborate on overlapping issues of safety, physical security vs.  cyber security. CIIP is a traditional engineering area in which safety standards and physical  security requirements are mandatorily implemented. Cyber security overlaps with safety and  181  http://www.csmonitor.com/Environment/2013/0227/Exclusive-Cyberattack-leaves-natural-gas-pipelines-vulnerable-to- sabotage, accessed 20 Nov 2013.  182  http://www.tecnalia.com/, accessed 21 Nov 2013.  183  http://cip.gmu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/October-2013_Financial-Services.pdf, accessed 21 Nov 2013.  184  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/critical-infrastructure-and-services/smart-grids-and-smart- metering/appropriate-security-measures-for-smart-grids/at_download/fullReport, accessed 21 Nov 2013.  http://www.csmonitor.com/Environment/2013/0227/Exclusive-Cyberattack-leaves-natural-gas-pipelines-vulnerable-to-sabotage http://www.csmonitor.com/Environment/2013/0227/Exclusive-Cyberattack-leaves-natural-gas-pipelines-vulnerable-to-sabotage http://www.tecnalia.com/ http://cip.gmu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/October-2013_Financial-Services.pdf https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/critical-infrastructure-and-services/smart-grids-and-smart-metering/appropriate-security-measures-for-smart-grids/at_download/fullReport https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/critical-infrastructure-and-services/smart-grids-and-smart-metering/appropriate-security-measures-for-smart-grids/at_download/fullReport  ENISA Threat Landscape 2013  Overview of current and emerging cyber-threats  11 December 2013  Page  45  physical security as it concerns the operational parts of CIIs. These overlaps need to be identified  and interfaces need to be established185.   Like any complex infrastructure used for large amounts of users/customers, the energy grid will  generate large amounts of data. This data will reflect, among other things, customer behaviour  regarding energy consumption. This massive information is a valuable asset for many  organisations and actors. It is expected that this information might be subject of data breaches,  manipulation, and fraud186.   Due to the inherent openness of the grid infrastructure, security measures based on detection of  intrusion/misuse will be necessary. Such measures will be developed around data exchanged  information. In particular, anomaly detection seems to be a very promising method to data  manipulation, fraud and targeted attacks187.   Due to the need of intensive investments in smart grid infrastructures, it is likely that security  will be developed on the basis of scenarios188;189. This is the next logical step from current  practices based on requirements190 and will be part of activities regarding the definition of  security architectures for smart grids in the coming year.  5.2 Threat Trends in Mobile Computing  As it can be easily foreseen, mobile computing will remain the prevailing platform for end-user  interaction and online activities. Being the perfect media convergence platform, mobile devices will  continue to be first choice for all kinds of users. But mobile computing goes beyond end-user  devices: mobile sensors, wirelessly interconnected components of intelligent environments, mobile  security devices, etc. are taking an important position within the mobile ecosystem that is currently  under significant development. Together with various infrastructure components and development  capabilities, this ecosystem becomes an inherent part of the internet architecture and services.  The current trend of “migration” of all kinds of malicious methods and tools into this ecosystem will  be continued in future179. But besides moving their attention to mobile computing, adversaries will  invest a lot of energy in identifying vulnerabilities in the mobile ecosystem: this is a new challenge,  as due to changes in user interaction and architecture models, new kinds of vulnerabilities will be  discovered and exploited.  Top emerging threats to mobile computing are:  Emerging Threat Threat Trend  1. Worms/Trojans (in particular performing man-in-the-mobile239  attacks).    2.

These shortcomings provide an attack  surface that will be exploited by adversaries.   The mobile ecosystem has introduced a change in existing protection strategies of organisations.  The fact that insecure devices enter into the company network makes them attractive to threat  agents as a steppingstone to the corporate environment.   New attack patterns presented recently have given an impression of possible malicious activities  involving mobile devices195. If seen in combination with the availability of low cost miniaturized  hardware196,197, one can expect that in short to middle term more and more attack vectors  attacking mobile devices will emerge.   The mobile ecosystem is one of the most significant “contributors” to big data. Apart from the  risk that this data is available to developers, operators and wireless providers without user  consent, it can also be easily manipulated198. Yet, it is a fact that the implications of this  exposure to end-users are not yet fully understood179.  191  http://threatpost.com/remote-code-injection-vulnerabilities-discovered-in-ios-apps, accessed 22 Nov 2013.  192  http://www.theregister.co.uk/2013/09/06/android_malware_spotting_hitching_a_ride_on_mobile_botnet/, accessed  22 Nov 2013.  193  http://www.tgdaily.com/mobility-brief/73765-apple-stores-malware-problem-exposed-by-researchers, accessed 22  Nov 2013.  194  http://threatpost.com/using-kernel-exploits-bypass-sandboxes-fun-and-profit-031813, accessed 27 Nov 2013.  195  http://hackaday.com/2013/08/01/blackhat-ios-device-charger-exploit-installs-and-activates-malware/, accessed 22 Nov  2013.  196  http://www.raspberrypi.org/, accessed 22 Nov 2013.  197  http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-24539417, accessed 22 Nov 2013.  198  https://mocana.com/blog/2013/03/26/manipulating-real-time-android-based-traffic-data-at-black-hat-europe/,  accessed 22 Nov 2013.  http://threatpost.com/remote-code-injection-vulnerabilities-discovered-in-ios-apps http://www.theregister.co.uk/2013/09/06/android_malware_spotting_hitching_a_ride_on_mobile_botnet/ http://www.tgdaily.com/mobility-brief/73765-apple-stores-malware-problem-exposed-by-researchers http://threatpost.com/using-kernel-exploits-bypass-sandboxes-fun-and-profit-031813 http://hackaday.com/2013/08/01/blackhat-ios-device-charger-exploit-installs-and-activates-malware/ http://www.raspberrypi.org/ http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-24539417 https://mocana.com/blog/2013/03/26/manipulating-real-time-android-based-traffic-data-at-black-hat-europe/  ENISA Threat Landscape 2013  Overview of current and emerging cyber-threats  11 December 2013  Page  47   Last but not least, mobile devices are a main source for information leakage threats. Seen in  combination with the vast amount of data that are available through the utilization of mobile  devices (e.g. geo-location, media behaviour, etc.), the potential of this information becomes  evident. Currently, mobile operators investigate business opportunities based on this data199. All  this indicates that the attractiveness of mobile will grow further, also for adversaries.  5.3 Threat Trends in Social Networks  In the reporting period social online activities have continued to increase and go mobile200. In  addition to this trend, more and more activities regarding leisure, education and professional life are  performed over social media. As result, this technology becomes the main channel for  communication, collection of knowledge201, dissemination of information, marketing.  During 2013 it has also become clear, that information from social media is just a part of the  information available online about behaviour and habits of users. Other sources are blogs, mails,  web activities, phone calls, etc. When all this data is combined via mining tools, large amount of  details about people’s lives can be assessed202, with young generation being the main group that is  digitally omnipresent178. It is evident that available social networking data are extremely interesting  for both good and bad. In the reporting period we have seen representative examples of misuse of  social media, such as misinformation, fake news, identity theft, fake social accounts etc203. These  cases are the evidence that social media have become a regular fixture in hacking business.  Top emerging threats to social networks are:  Emerging Threat Threat Trend  1.

As a consequence, misinformation propagation speed exceeds that of  serious journalism. Social media spread context free content. The relevance and authenticity of  spread information cannot be easily checked. This is a risk for society212, as misinformation can  be used with political, cultural, censorship or propaganda objectives in mind.   An important question for users for social networking systems will be how to balance their  privacy and security with benefits gained by using applications processing their location data,  personal preferences and habits. While some will look for anonymity based solutions, others  might scrutinise their digital presence. It is expected that anonymity technologies will be  developed and that the discussion about digital rights and “right to be forgotten”213,214 will be  refuelled.   Information found in big data can lead to a virtual growth of knowledge about social networking:  it includes information about visited sites, performed searches, collaboration, phone calls, blogs,  calendars, contact lists, etc178. This network of interconnections can be easily modelled and  constructed. It encompasses much more than friends and likes: it is a reflection of human live in  the digital space. Besides using this data for good, adversaries will keep trying to misuse this  information.   Human engineering attacks through online social hackers will continue keeping the cyber  security community busy. Social hacking will remain an important channel for malware, phishing,  208  http://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/blackhole-exploit-kit-spam-campaign-hits-pinterest/,  accessed 25 Nov 2013.  209  http://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/malware-hijacks-social-media-accounts-via-browser-add- ons/, accessed 25 Nov 2013.  210  http://arstechnica.com/security/2013/02/facebook-computers-compromised-by-zero-day-java-exploit/, accessed 25  Nov 2013.  211  http://www.computerworlduk.com/news/security/3443498/botnets-target-social-networks-with-spam/?olo=rss,  accessed 25 Nov 2013.  212  http://www.weforum.org/reports/global-risks-2013-eighth-edition, accessed 25 Nov 2013.  213  http://www.nationalsecuritylawbrief.com/the-right-to-be-forgotten-in-a-digital-age/, accessed 25 Nov 2013.  214 http://www.mondaq.com/x/274428/data+protection/Court+Ruling+Reinforces+The+Right+To+Be+Forgotten+On+Social +Media+Sites, accessed 25 Nov 2013.  http://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/blackhole-exploit-kit-spam-campaign-hits-pinterest/ http://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/malware-hijacks-social-media-accounts-via-browser-add-ons/ http://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/malware-hijacks-social-media-accounts-via-browser-add-ons/ http://arstechnica.com/security/2013/02/facebook-computers-compromised-by-zero-day-java-exploit/ http://www.computerworlduk.com/news/security/3443498/botnets-target-social-networks-with-spam/?olo=rss http://www.weforum.org/reports/global-risks-2013-eighth-edition http://www.nationalsecuritylawbrief.com/the-right-to-be-forgotten-in-a-digital-age/ http://www.mondaq.com/x/274428/data+protection/Court+Ruling+Reinforces+The+Right+To+Be+Forgotten+On+Social+Media+Sites http://www.mondaq.com/x/274428/data+protection/Court+Ruling+Reinforces+The+Right+To+Be+Forgotten+On+Social+Media+Sites  ENISA Threat Landscape 2013  Overview of current and emerging cyber-threats  11 December 2013  Page  49  spamming and identity theft attacks215. Despite awareness, well-crafted social media attacks will  show high success rates, especially when additional information (see section on big data and  Internet of Things) is being used to round up the attack.   Social forensics is an interesting area that analyses user behaviour from various information  sources providing evidence about interactions, trust level of connections, exchanged messages,  etc. Beyond using this tools/technology for law enforcement reasons, such tools might be used  to unveil social “robots”, that is, social profiles that have been created with nefarious objectives  in mind178,216.  5.4 Threat Trends in Cloud Computing  Cloud computing is becoming an integral part of the business IT ecosystem: company services and  data may be hosted in cloud servers, while at the same time end-users maintain theirown cloud  (storage) services to increase effectiveness and convenience. Mostly, business data in the cloud are  protected only via security mechanisms provided by the cloud environment. Taking as given that  business data are stored in multiple cloud environments (e.g. through business users using could  storage on their mobile devices), the enforcement of a comprehensive security policy for cloud  services is a challenging task. This is an opportunity for attackers: potential weaknesses in cloud  security are abused to gain access to company data. And these weaknesses are not at the cloud side  but rather at the user side. For example (cloud) identity theft: the easiest targets for attackers will be  weakly secured mobile devices accessing a cloud service.  Gradually, cloud services go beyond storage and cover hosting of applications and databases.  Through the proliferation of web services - accessed via browsers and apps - the cloud is exposed to  software vulnerabilities and web-specific attacks. In the reporting period we have seen many attack  patterns affecting cloud services based on threats like code injection217, malware and botnets218,219.  We will keep seeing these threats affecting cloud services, while cloud providers will further enhance  protection of their services via additional security mechanisms220. Moreover, the continuous  concentration of data in the cloud will raise issues of resilience, as these services are going to reach a  high degree of criticality. Nevertheless, in the reporting period significant efforts have been invested  by cloud providers in performing threat and risk assessments for cloud services221,222. Also other  stakeholders have issued protection practices for cloud services223. This contributes to a better  assurance of cloud services; in many cases protection offered in a cloud environment may be higher  than in legacy IT-environments. Yet due to complexity, the implementation of these measures  remains a challenge224.  215  http://www.pcworld.com/article/2059940/fake-social-media-id-duped-securityaware-it-guys.html, accessed 25 Nov  2013.  216 http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702304607104579212122084821400?mod=WSJ_hp_LEFTWhatsNe wsCollection, accessed 25 Nov 2014.  217  https://www.digitalocean.com/community/articles/how-to-secure-a-cloud-server-against-sql-injection, accessed 3 Dec  2013.  218  http://www.alertlogic.com/resources/cloud-security-report/, accessed 2 Dec 2013.  219  http://www.darkreading.com/cloud, accessed 4 Dec 2013.  220  http://www.cs.ucsb.edu/~koc/ns/projects/12Reports/PucherDimopoulos.pdf, accessed 3 Dec 2013.  221 https://downloads.cloudsecurityalliance.org/initiatives/top_threats/The_Notorious_Nine_Cloud_Computing_Top_Threa  ts_in_2013.pdf, accessed 26 Nov 2013.  222  http://security.force.com/security/tools/forcecom/scannerhelp, accessed 2 Dec 2013.  223  https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KBpPRBY9E0_v_H2JvFO-_XUXy-KSfBTRXOphjqoNS_4/edit?pli=1, accessed 3 Dec  2013.  224  http://www.darkreading.com/cloud/cloud-security-measures-too-opaque-for-c/240148526, accessed 3 Dec 2013.  http://www.pcworld.com/article/2059940/fake-social-media-id-duped-securityaware-it-guys.html http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702304607104579212122084821400?mod=WSJ_hp_LEFTWhatsNewsCollection http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702304607104579212122084821400?mod=WSJ_hp_LEFTWhatsNewsCollection https://www.digitalocean.com/community/articles/how-to-secure-a-cloud-server-against-sql-injection http://www.alertlogic.com/resources/cloud-security-report/ http://www.darkreading.com/cloud http://www.cs.ucsb.edu/~koc/ns/projects/12Reports/PucherDimopoulos.pdf https://downloads.cloudsecurityalliance.org/initiatives/top_threats/The_Notorious_Nine_Cloud_Computing_Top_Threats_in_2013.pdf https://downloads.cloudsecurityalliance.org/initiatives/top_threats/The_Notorious_Nine_Cloud_Computing_Top_Threats_in_2013.pdf http://security.force.com/security/tools/forcecom/scannerhelp https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KBpPRBY9E0_v_H2JvFO-_XUXy-KSfBTRXOphjqoNS_4/edit?pli=1 http://www.darkreading.com/cloud/cloud-security-measures-too-opaque-for-c/240148526  ENISA Threat Landscape 2013  Overview of current and emerging cyber-threats  11 December 2013  Page  50  Top emerging threats to cloud computing are225:  Emerging Threat Threat Trend  1.

Undoubtedly these concentrations of user data are THE target  for threat agents. Attackers will keep trying to take over control of these data226,227 and services  in order to achieve numerous of malicious objectives, the main being to breach large amounts of  data.   Following recent nation state sponsored espionage activities, one can expect customers to pay  more attention to the location of data centers and the impact of foreign legislation on cloud  services 228. Such issues might be show-stopper for existing cloud services and foster the creation  of appropriately equipped clouds. These issue will be relevant for a significant number of  225  It should be noted that the threats mentioned below result from the exposures of both customer and provider and  include all kinds of services offered/used (i.e. IaaS, PasS, SaaS).  226  http://www.websense.com/content/websense-2014-security-predictions-report.aspx, accessed 25 Nov 2013.  227  http://www.infosecurity-magazine.com/view/35234/sql-injection-and-crosssite-scripting-attacks-surge-in-q3/, accessed  25 Nov 2013.  228  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/cloud-computing/good-practice-guide-for-securely- deploying-governmental-clouds, accessed 25 Nov 2013.  http://www.websense.com/content/websense-2014-security-predictions-report.aspx http://www.infosecurity-magazine.com/view/35234/sql-injection-and-crosssite-scripting-attacks-surge-in-q3/ http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/cloud-computing/good-practice-guide-for-securely-deploying-governmental-clouds http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/cloud-computing/good-practice-guide-for-securely-deploying-governmental-clouds  ENISA Threat Landscape 2013  Overview of current and emerging cyber-threats  11 December 2013  Page  51  potential users coming from the governmental and agency sector, especially within  Europe229,230,231.   In general, the proliferation of web services accessed via browsers opens doors for all kinds of  web-specific threats in the entire chain of components involved in the interaction, that is, from  the client to the back end system. Hence, when cloud services are used (i.e. SaaS, IaaS) these are  exposed to threats abusing software vulnerabilities such as code injection, exploit kits,  rogueware/ransomware/scareware. Nevertheless, it is expected that cloud computing will  positively contribute to reduce exposure232. This is because of security measures that can be put  in place and enforcement of software and infrastructure architectures/frameworks.   The computing capabilities of cloud environments are an attractive use-case for cyber-criminals.  Instead of maintaining expensive and easy to locate own computing capabilities, powerful cloud  computers would be beneficial for their purposes for nefarious activities233,234. The race between  threat agents and cloud providers is going to be continued in 2014. Cloud providers will have to  find ways to detect malicious use of their resources.   Through the use of mobile computing, business users consume various cloud storage services for  the purposes of convenience. Often, these services are operated on private basis and circumvent  corporate security policies. Lax cloud security policies introduce a serious risk for corporate data.  Information thefts, elevation of privilege and data breaches are the results. It is expected that  the challenge of scrutinizing security of business data will continue bothering security  professionals.   Customers will look for encryption mechanisms/technology to mitigate certain risks, but  encryption can only mitigate some risks. In many cloud computing scenarios, customers are  actually processing data on the cloud platform, and this processing cannot, for example, be  encrypted to prevent eavesdropping by the provider. Further, current encryption  mechanisms/technology does not provide the desired efficiency for use within a cloud  environment179,235. It is expected that new mechanisms will be introduced in order to avoid  existing shortcomings236 of available approaches237.  5.5 Threat Trends in Trust Infrastructures  Trust infrastructures considered to be systems, components and functions that provide strong  authentication. As such, trust infrastructures are building the backbone for a variety of security  mechanisms, as they establish authenticity, and thus trust, between an object and a subject.  Subjects may be humans or other trustworthy components participating in a trusted interaction.  Such functions are increasingly utilized by service providers, while it is clear that authentication  methods without trusted devices (i.e. hardware/non-replicable tokens) are less secure and thus  229  http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_MEMO-13-898_en.htm, accessed 25 Nov 2013.  230  http://www.pcworld.idg.com.au/article/464906/european_us_cloud_providers_go_head-to- head_after_nsa_revelations/, accessed 25 Nov 2013.  231  http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/aug/08/nsa-revelations-fears-cloud-computing, accessed 25 Nov 2013.  232  http://www.infosecurity-magazine.com/view/32698/microsoft-unveils-cloudbased-realtime-botnet-infosharing- initiative/, accessed 25 Nov 2014.  233  http://securitywatch.pcmag.com/software/299448-malware-as-a-service-simplifies-launching-cyber-attacks, accessed  25 Nov 2013.  234 http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/9241629/Cybercriminals_use_Google_Cloud_Messaging_service_to_control_ malware_on_Android_devices accessed 25 Nov 2013.  235  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/flash-notes/securing-data-in-cyber-space/at_download/file, accessed 25 Nov  2013.  236  http://www.networkworld.com/news/tech/2013/040913-cloud-encryption-268542.html, accessed 25 Nov 2013.  237  http://eprint.iacr.org/2013/409.pdf, accessed 25 Nov 2013.  http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_MEMO-13-898_en.htm http://www.pcworld.idg.com.au/article/464906/european_us_cloud_providers_go_head-to-head_after_nsa_revelations/ http://www.pcworld.idg.com.au/article/464906/european_us_cloud_providers_go_head-to-head_after_nsa_revelations/ http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/aug/08/nsa-revelations-fears-cloud-computing http://www.infosecurity-magazine.com/view/32698/microsoft-unveils-cloudbased-realtime-botnet-infosharing-initiative/ http://www.infosecurity-magazine.com/view/32698/microsoft-unveils-cloudbased-realtime-botnet-infosharing-initiative/ http://securitywatch.pcmag.com/software/299448-malware-as-a-service-simplifies-launching-cyber-attacks http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/9241629/Cybercriminals_use_Google_Cloud_Messaging_service_to_control_malware_on_Android_devices http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/9241629/Cybercriminals_use_Google_Cloud_Messaging_service_to_control_malware_on_Android_devices http://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/flash-notes/securing-data-in-cyber-space/at_download/file http://www.networkworld.com/news/tech/2013/040913-cloud-encryption-268542.html http://eprint.iacr.org/2013/409.pdf  ENISA Threat Landscape 2013  Overview of current and emerging cyber-threats  11 December 2013  Page  52  vulnerable238. Trust infrastructures are one of the main targets of cyber criminals: successful attacks  against them unveil a wide variety of fraud options, especially in the area of banking, finance and  payment.  In the reporting period, ENISA has conducted work regarding trusted authentication in the area of e- Finance and e-Payment services. Various methods of widely used authentication services are  considered, including passwords (OTP, TAN), signatures (based on chip or mobile), tokens (OTP  generators, mobile phones, etc.), etc. Particular attention is being paid to multi-channel  authentication methods, i.e. two-factor authentication. This work examines the threat exposure of  electronic Identity and Authentication Systems (eIDAS) and assesses related risks. Though sector  specific, this work is considered representative for trust infrastructure. Conclusions made and open  issues can be applied to other related areas by analogy. Authentication has been addressed in other  related reports, by identifying risks, issues and gaps178.  Top emerging threats to trust infrastructure are:  Emerging Threat Threat Trend  1.

Unification of authentication methods  among various application areas should be an objective for operators of e-commerce, e- payment and e-baking applications.   Broken authentication 242  is a significant risk. Especially in web applications, broken  authentication has achieved second of top 10243. In the middle term, a more intensive testing of  weaknesses/potential attack patterns for used authentication mechanisms seems to be  necessary244.   Successful attacks on authentication target the human interface. It is important to raise  awareness among operations and users of authentication systems through continuous  training245,246.   Authentication mechanisms implemented through application and kernel functions are  susceptive to attacks bypassing sandboxes247. This fact underlines the importance of information  security in application development. It also demonstrates potential weaknesses of software  authentication solutions, especially for high risk operations/transactions.   Authentication over NFC-enabled devices is coming248. While this technology is considered as  very effective in implementing authentication/identification functions, the security functions of  NFC itself are not part of the NFC tag specification. Due to contactless nature of this protocol,  interception of communication is quite easy. As NFC becomes popular, attack methods on NFC  devices will be an issue to take care of in the middle term249.  5.6 Threat Trends in Big Data  Big data are large collections of data that emerge from the operation and usage of large  infrastructure, applications, devices/appliances, web services, user interaction, etc. In the reporting  period, big data has enjoyed significant popularity250251. Also the potential behind this “asset” has  been more extensively manifested and discussed199,252. As a matter of fact, big data seems to be  main source of monetization from commercial organisations that are in the possession of this  good253. This is gradually understood by end users as they suffered information losses or the  negative consequences to their privacy resulting from their online activities254. Generally speaking,  big data has started to become an issue because various actors in society have been aware about  241  http://hdknr.github.io/docs/identity/signed_nonce.html, accessed 22 Nov 2013.  242  https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Broken_Authentication_and_Session_Management, accessed 22 Nov 2013.  243  https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Top_10_2013-Top_10, accessed 22 Nov 2013.  244  http://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-37949-9_63#page-1, accessed 22 Nov 2013.  245  http://www.inforisktoday.com/whitepapers/when-criminals-defeat-authentication-lessons-learned-from-w-874,  accessed 22 Nov 2013.  246  http://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=2422416, accessed 22 Nov 2013.  247  http://threatpost.com/using-kernel-exploits-bypass-sandboxes-fun-and-profit-031813, accessed 22 Nov 2013.  248  http://www.nfcworld.com/technology/authentication/, accessed 22 Nov 2013.  249  http://resources.infosecinstitute.com/near-field-communication-nfc-technology-vulnerabilities-and-principal-attack- schema/, accessed 22 Nov 2013.  250  http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/9215033/Big_data_to_drive_a_surveillance_society, accessed 26 Nov 2013.  251  http://www.computer.org/portal/web/computingnow/content?g=53319&type=article&urlTitle=big-data%2C-big- brother%2C-big-money, accessed 26 Nov 2013.  252  http://reports.weforum.org/outlook-14/the-future-of-surveillance/, accessed 26 Nov 2013.  253  http://www.com/watch?v=85mu9PLWCuI, accessed 23 Nov 2013.  254  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rn4Rupla11M, accessed 27 Nov 2013.  http://hdknr.github.io/docs/identity/signed_nonce.html https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Broken_Authentication_and_Session_Management https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Top_10_2013-Top_10 http://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-37949-9_63#page-1 http://www.inforisktoday.com/whitepapers/when-criminals-defeat-authentication-lessons-learned-from-w-874 http://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=2422416 http://threatpost.com/using-kernel-exploits-bypass-sandboxes-fun-and-profit-031813 http://www.nfcworld.com/technology/authentication/ http://resources.infosecinstitute.com/near-field-communication-nfc-technology-vulnerabilities-and-principal-attack-schema/ http://resources.infosecinstitute.com/near-field-communication-nfc-technology-vulnerabilities-and-principal-attack-schema/ http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/9215033/Big_data_to_drive_a_surveillance_society http://www.computer.org/portal/web/computingnow/content?g=53319&type=article&urlTitle=big-data%2C-big-brother%2C-big-money http://www.computer.org/portal/web/computingnow/content?g=53319&type=article&urlTitle=big-data%2C-big-brother%2C-big-money http://reports.weforum.org/outlook-14/the-future-of-surveillance/ http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=85mu9PLWCuI http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rn4Rupla11M  ENISA Threat Landscape 2013  Overview of current and emerging cyber-threats  11 December 2013  Page  54  the value and potential of this asset, albeit it has been actually generated as side-product on online  activities.  In the short to medium term, big data is considered as an important asset that can be used as a  source for monetization through commercial organisations. Moreover, recent worldwide discussions  on surveillance based on big data have given rise to concerns about use vs. abuse of this information  with regard to the privacy of users.  But also the influence big data will have on the market are of big interest and importance: is big data  going to create monopolies that will build their influence on knowledge of user’s life and on profiles?  How are states going to regulate the collection and use of this information in order to find the best  balance between security and privacy, while maintaining the opportunities for new business models  to be developed and established?  Top emerging threats emerging from the misuse of big data by adversaries are255:  Emerging Threat Threat Trend  1. Information Leakage (big data leaks will provide information to  adversaries to facilitate the launch of attacks)    2. Data Breaches (information gained from big data will provide insights  in order to breach user and company data. Breaches of big data will  be a priority for attackers too)    3.

Targeted Attacks (this threat will be used in order to breach collected  big data from collecting organizations)    Legend:  Declining,  Stable,  Increasing  Table 9: Emerging threats and their trends in the area of Big Data  255  The threats considered are primarily related to the abuse of big data by adversaries to launch attacks. They do not cover  threat exposure of big data itself (i.e. manipulation, fraud, theft, etc.).  ENISA Threat Landscape 2013  Overview of current and emerging cyber-threats  11 December 2013  Page  55  Besides the above emerging threat landscape, the following issues have been identified:   As the amount of data created by user activities grows and users realize that this data is used for  business, profiling, marketing and analysis purposes256, the desire to keep information private  will grow257. This desire emerges from the feeling of complete and constant observability of their  lives through a virtually omnipresent, yet blurry defined “big brother”.   Given that big data will be the main source for collecting intelligence at all levels of society  (commercial, state), it inevitably moves in the focus of adversaries. And it does so in a dual way:  firstly it comprises main source of intelligence for malicious purposes, and as such becomes a  desirable good; and at the same time is a target for manipulations in order to hide own activities  (for the later see next point).   As big data will be increasingly used for analysis, anomaly detection, intelligence gathering by  governments and agencies, mission creep, etc., adversaries will look for ways to hide their  activities. In a similar manner, they will try to manipulate big data to seamlessly affect results of  analysis, metrics and fool established response mechanisms179.   Despite existing public/media confidence that big data is collected, controlled and analysed by  government agencies, the fact is that it mainly emerges through systems and technologies that  are owned and operated by private sector252. Hence, activities of governmental agencies take  place at a second level251 with regard to primary creation and collection. As far as this interaction  is not transparent, the fears of public regarding influence to democracy and self-determination  of private data usage will grow. Intransparent data collection and analysis regimes are a risk for  all involved actors and the pressure to mitigate this risk will constantly grow.   Uncontrolled collection, usage and dissemination of user and systems data are the perfect  playground for malicious activities. Over the existing cyber-physical relationship, fraud regarding  cyber-reputation and a person’s digital footmark is likely to happen. And is may have devastating  impact to people’s lives254. Such fraudulent activities targeting individual persons or group of  individuals will be based on access and manipulation of big data.   An important part of big data is data related to security. According to experiences gained in the  reporting period, it seems that harnessing the potential of big security data is still at an  immature state. Though commercially explored by security companies, security data has still  enormous potential with regard to coordination of activities, response and knowledge gathering.  Areas like threat analysis, attack pattern recognition and quick adaptation of existing defence  may be significantly advanced when using big security data. In short to medium term, the  security community will leverage on these potential advantages, forced by the number, variety,  sophistication and impact of cyber-attacks.   Security big data are quite easily available/accessible from non-commercial sources258,259. It  should be assessed if some controls might be necessary to identify potential recipients of this  information.  5.7 Threat Trends in the Interconnected Devices: The Internet of Things  Although not new260, the issue of security of interconnected devices and Internet of Things (IoT) has  bothered threat analysts in the reporting period179,180,257,264,266. This is obviously because of the  256  http://www.spiegel.de/netzwelt/web/lg-smart-tvs-senden-heimlich-nutzerdaten-in-die-konzernzentrale-a-934614.html,  accessed 26 Nov 2013.  257  http://www.symantec.com/connect/blogs/2014-predictions-symantec-0, accessed 26 Nov 2013.  258  http://datalossdb.org/, accessed 27 Nov 2013.  259  http://www.shodanhq.com/, accessed 27 Nov 2013.  260  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/media/press-releases/flying-2.0-study-of-internet-of-things-rfid-in-air-travel, accessed 26  Nov 2013.  http://www.spiegel.de/netzwelt/web/lg-smart-tvs-senden-heimlich-nutzerdaten-in-die-konzernzentrale-a-934614.html http://www.symantec.com/connect/blogs/2014-predictions-symantec-0 http://datalossdb.org/ http://www.shodanhq.com/ https://www.enisa.europa.eu/media/press-releases/flying-2.0-study-of-internet-of-things-rfid-in-air-travel  ENISA Threat Landscape 2013  Overview of current and emerging cyber-threats  11 December 2013  Page  56  estimated number of interconnected devices in one-two years’ time (ca. 15 to 25 billion179). Main  concern is the low level of security provided: small devices are interconnected, usually over insecure  channels and protocols, generate a great deal of data, are designed to perform primitive tasks and  do not implement any security measures.  Because of poor security, eventually poor maintenance but also due to the nature of data and  functions performed, smart environments are considered as the ultimate target for cyber criminals.  Potential impact of attacks based on, for example, home appliances will be very difficult to prevent.  One needs to imagine a phishing attack whereas the adversary possesses knowledge about the  whereabouts of the smart home of the victim. Or the impact of information leaked from a user’s  media centre in the creation of profiles. Not to talk about potential impact from the manipulation of  smart devices used within e-Health applications, monitoring of minors261 and elderly people. Even  critical infrastructure services based on smart devices are at risk262.  Given these developments, it is obvious that in the near future the Internet of Things is going to  attract the attention of cyber-security professionals, government and consumers. Although  potentially new threats are going to be emerge in this area, in the table below we try to  demonstrate how available threats may be applied to this ecosystem.

Moreover, given the fact that interconnected  devices permanently send data, they pose performance requirements to network  infrastructures, also outside their locations (based on the external interconnections available)180.   Dynamicity in connection of appliances leads to dynamic context and content of transmitted  data264. This leads to potentially large amount of vulnerabilities and security issues, as data may  reveal details about the functions, operating patterns and behaviour of the owner. This poses  significant privacy challenges/concerns180.   Devices have built in functionality, often as embedded systems. These functions are not  accessible to users, may include unknown functions265 and are difficult to update, maintain, i.e.  patching257 to accommodate updates fixing identified vulnerabilities266.   Due to none or low level security, smart environments per se do not generate information to  inform users about their operational status, nor can they be easily connected to existing security  back-end systems such as incident and emergency response.   Interconnected devices and smart environments provide an ideal environment for all threat  agent groups to perform malicious activities257 ranging from data collection and data  manipulation up to fooling home appliances of their victims, thus creating harm even to their  lives.  264  https://www.europol.europa.eu/content/project-2020-scenarios-future-cybercrime, accessed 26 Nov 2013.  265  http://doctorbeet.blogspot.gr/2013/11/lg-smart-tvs-logging-usb-filenames-and.html, accessed 26 Nov 2013.  266  http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2013/08/coming-soon-the-cybercrime-of-things/278409/, accessed 26  Nov 2013.  https://www.europol.europa.eu/content/project-2020-scenarios-future-cybercrime http://doctorbeet.blogspot.gr/2013/11/lg-smart-tvs-logging-usb-filenames-and.html http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2013/08/coming-soon-the-cybercrime-of-things/278409/  ENISA Threat Landscape 2013  Overview of current and emerging cyber-threats  11 December 2013  Page  58  Page intentionally left blank  ENISA Threat Landscape 2013  Overview of current and emerging cyber-threats  11 December 2013  Page  59  ETL 2013: Food for Thought  Lessons Learned and Conclusions  ENISA Threat Landscape 2013  Overview of current and emerging cyber-threats  11 December 2013  Page  60  6 Food for Thought: Lessons Learned and Conclusions  6.1 Lessons learned  Being in the second year of its existence ETL 2013 was a step forward in the learning curve of  information collection and threat analysis. In this section we would like to share some experience  gathered during this work. This experience concerns two sides of the activities performed: a) the  “process” followed in ENISA’s work, that is, experience with information collection and analysis, and  b) some highlights from the analysed content. In particular:  Lessons from the ETL process:   From the reception of this work, we believe that threat landscapes are very interesting for  multiple stakeholders in the area of cyber security and beyond. Although threat information is  available, analysis and assessment are at a low level of maturity.   It is necessary to include more information sources into the threat landscape, such as incident  data, perform better analysis of breaches and coordinate and enhance threat knowledge.   Social media are a very fast dissemination channel. Besides risks (see section 5.3) this brings  some advantages, especially when time matters as it is the case in threat analysis. By following  various individuals, organisations and groups in social media, we were in the position to increase  the speed of threat information acquisition.   By tracking the uptake of previous ENISA deliverables in the area of threat landscape (i.e. ETL  2012 and 2013 midyear report), we have found out that the appetite of the security and media  community with regards to information on threats and threat trends is quite big. One can argue  that this strong trend will be continued in the coming year.   Although usually outside of the scope of assessments, the threat landscape is significantly  affected by low frequency large impact events267,268,269,270 (black swans271). Black swans have an  impact on the threat landscape, as they represent high impact unexpected events. After a black  swan event, it is clear that a new kind of threat does exist (independently from the likelihood of  occurrence). It is then left to threat analysis if this kind of threat should be considered in threat  analysis. However, in the cyber security community, black swans are often meant to be seldom  events that are not being managed and/or their mitigation is expensive. This is a deviation from  the definition of black swan. This can create confusions within experts and bears risks.   In the reporting period we have found out that quite a few European organisations work on  areas touching the threat landscape. It is imperative that these organisations are coming  together and adapt their work in a way that all potential synergies are mobilized. ENISA will take  up this coordination task in the coming years.  Lessons from the analysed content:   Although fairly simple security measures significantly minimize threat exposure, it is remarkable  that still over half of the organisations fail to apply/implement them.  267  http://arstechnica.com/security/2013/03/spamhaus-ddos-grows-to-internet-threatening-size/, accessed 22 Oct 2013.  268  http://blog.crysys.hu/2013/02/miniduke/, accessed 22 Oct 2013.  269  http://intelreport.mandiant.com/, accessed 22 Oct 2013.  270  http://news.yahoo.com/e-u-pushes-stricter-data-protection-snowden-nsa-233347589.html, accessed 22 Oct 2013.  271  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_swan_theory, accessed 22 Oct 2013.  http://arstechnica.com/security/2013/03/spamhaus-ddos-grows-to-internet-threatening-size/ http://blog.crysys.hu/2013/02/miniduke/ http://intelreport.mandiant.com/ http://news.yahoo.com/e-u-pushes-stricter-data-protection-snowden-nsa-233347589.html http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_swan_theory  ENISA Threat Landscape 2013  Overview of current and emerging cyber-threats  11 December 2013  Page  61   Identification of regional trends is not always possible for all threats at a moderate level of  effort. This is because the geographic dimension for all kind of threats and incidents is not  always reported.   Relevance of threats for various organisation profiles is not always possible at a moderate level  of effort. This is because it is difficult to draw conclusions about types of assets found within  company profiles. Yet, ENISA work in 2013 in the area of smart grids and eID for financial  services has demonstrated that this is possible when sufficient resources and expertise are  available.   With the current level of cooperation, data availability and trust levels, it is not possible to  validate current threats and threat trends based on real data in a near-time manner. Although  significant amount of data exists, it is not optimally used for the validation of threat  assessments.Within ENISA it is planned to combine information collection (i.e. including Art 13a  activities272) with exchange of information with other stakeholders, both public and private ones.  This will be enforced witin the work on the ETL 2014.   Current practices in cyber security measures are based on the assumption that a cyber-security  strategy should minimize exposure of as many threats as possible. By transferring this approach  to the automotive sector, it is as if one tries to build a car that survives all accidents unscathed.   In the reporting period, we have seen a far better coverage of threat agents within the collected  material. A deficit in this area has been mentioned in the conclusions of ETL 2012. It seems that  the community has achieved good progress on this matter.   The awareness for cyber threats has increased, especially within security professionals. Albeit  being a result of a more efficient collection practices from ENISA’s side, there is evidence that in  the reporting period number, width and quality of threat information collected has significantly  increased. This is a significant and important improvement in comparison to 2012.   In the reporting period we were in the position to “test” own and other predictions made in  2012. The comparison has been made within 2013 mid-year report29. We have found out that  the majority of predictions for 2013 have been realized.   The arrest of the developer and operator of the exploit kit Blackhole54 is considered as a major  event in the reporting period. It remains to be seen what impact this event will have in the fast  developing area of exploit kits: is this going to create an unfilled gap, are other adversaries going  to take over further development of the tool or are other exploit kits going to fill the gap?  Evaluation of this situation is decisive for understanding the interconnections and levels of  cooperation among threat agents. This may be a strong indicator for the entire cyber-threat  landscape.  6.2 Conclusions  The above mentioned learned lessons bring us seamlessly to the conclusions of ETL 2013 by means  of open issue and need for further work. The sequence of open issues below is according to assumed  importance:   The end-user perspective needs to be seriously taken into account by the cyber-security  community. End-users have to get more actively involved in protection against cyber-  272  https://resilience.enisa.europa.eu/article-13, accessed 3 Dec 2013.  https://resilience.enisa.europa.eu/article-13  ENISA Threat Landscape 2013  Overview of current and emerging cyber-threats  11 December 2013  Page  62  threats. Analysis shows that knowledge about implementation of simple security measures  is not available in the wide basis of end-users. Adoption of simple security measures by end-  users would half the number of cyber incidents worldwide!   It has become clear that a greater coordination of information collection, analysis,  assessment and validation among involved organisations is necessary. Numerous public and  private organisations work on overlapping issues of threat information collection and threat  analysis. Increased coordination, for example, among the ones working on open source  information and ones working with operational data could increase quality and speed of  assessed threats.. Moreover, activities of Member States and stakeholders from private  sector will be also considered. Objective is to assess the feasibility of such  coordination/cooperation and establish proper areas and steps to obtain it.   Threats need to be expanded with additional information regarding attack workflow/kill  chains and attack patterns. This information needs to be extracted from incident analysis,  establishing thus the necessary feedback to improve quality of assessed threats. This will be  real added-value for all stakeholders using a threat landscape, as every threat description  would contain information on attack scenarios derived from real incidents.   Building threat intelligence remains one of the main challenges in the cyber-security  community: ways to facilitate information collection, develop tools to support threat  analysis, sharing of information, etc. In 2013 ENISA has delivered important information in  approaches and tools for creating and sharing threat intelligence273. It is important to  capitalize on these recommendations and establish a community working towards their  achievement.   In the analysed material, security experts have underlined the importance of increasing  speed in threat assessment and dissemination by reducing detection and assessment cycles.  In order to achieve this, stakeholders need to synergise (see above point) and tune up their  activities.   Increasing sophistication of attacks, increasing complexity of IT-architectures, increasing  volume of data and blurred limits of security perimeter pose significant challenges to cyber-  security defences. The research community need to examine the elasticity of security  measures: besides active measures (e.g. firewalls, IDSs), passive security mechanisms need  to be developed (e.g. automated policy generation, validation and enforcement274). IT-  infrastructures need to be resilient and robust to successful attacks without suffering severe  impact regarding their availability, integrity and confidentiality.  273  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/support/data-sharing, accessed 28 Nov 2013.  274  http://www.ptidej.net/seminar/130418%20-%20Makan%20Pourzandi%20-%20ESF%20--  %20An%20Elastic%20Security%20Framework%20For%20Cloud%20Infrastructures/130418%20- %20Makan%20Pourzandi%20-%20ESF%20-- %20An%20Elastic%20Security%20Framework%20For%20Cloud%20Infrastructures.pdf, accessed 3 Dec 2013.  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/support/data-sharing http://www.ptidej.net/seminar/130418%20-%20Makan%20Pourzandi%20-%20ESF%20--%20An%20Elastic%20Security%20Framework%20For%20Cloud%20Infrastructures/130418%20-%20Makan%20Pourzandi%20-%20ESF%20--%20An%20Elastic%20Security%20Framework%20For%20Cloud%20Infrastructures.pdf http://www.ptidej.net/seminar/130418%20-%20Makan%20Pourzandi%20-%20ESF%20--%20An%20Elastic%20Security%20Framework%20For%20Cloud%20Infrastructures/130418%20-%20Makan%20Pourzandi%20-%20ESF%20--%20An%20Elastic%20Security%20Framework%20For%20Cloud%20Infrastructures.pdf http://www.ptidej.net/seminar/130418%20-%20Makan%20Pourzandi%20-%20ESF%20--%20An%20Elastic%20Security%20Framework%20For%20Cloud%20Infrastructures/130418%20-%20Makan%20Pourzandi%20-%20ESF%20--%20An%20Elastic%20Security%20Framework%20For%20Cloud%20Infrastructures.pdf http://www.ptidej.net/seminar/130418%20-%20Makan%20Pourzandi%20-%20ESF%20--%20An%20Elastic%20Security%20Framework%20For%20Cloud%20Infrastructures/130418%20-%20Makan%20Pourzandi%20-%20ESF%20--%20An%20Elastic%20Security%20Framework%20For%20Cloud%20Infrastructures.pdf  ENISA Threat Landscape 2013  Overview of current and emerging cyber-threats  11 December 2013  Page  63  PO Box 1309, 710 01 Heraklion, Greece  Tel: +30 28 14 40 9710  info@enisa.europa.eu  www.enisa.europa.eu  TP-AE-13-001-EN -N  ENISA Headquarters  European Union Agency for Network and Information Security  Science and Technology Park of Crete (ITE)  Vassilika Vouton, 700 13, Heraklion, Greece  Athens Office  1 Vass.

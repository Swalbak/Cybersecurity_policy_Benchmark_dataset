The framework is called NIST Cyber Security Framework for Critical  Infrastructure (CSF). Many organizations are currently implementing or aligned to different  information security frameworks. The implementation of NIST CSF needs to be aligned with and  complement the existing frameworks. NIST states that the NIST CSF is not a maturity  framework. Therefore, there is a need to adopt an existing maturity model or create one to have  a common way to measure the CSF implementation progress. This paper explores the  applicability of number of maturity models to be used as a measure to the security poster of  organizations implementing the NIST CSF. This paper reviews the NIST CSF and compares it to  other information security related frameworks such as COBIT, ISO/IEC 27001 and the ISF  Standard of Good Practice (SoGP) for Information Security. We propose a new information  security maturity model (ISMM) that fills the gap in the NIST CSF.  KEYWORDS  Information Security, Maturity Model, Cyber-Security.  1. INTRODUCTION  Many organizations could be aligned with one of the information security related best practice  frameworks. This makes the alignment of the NIST CSF with such frameworks a must. NIST  CSF is a set of industry standards and best practices [1]. The framework of NIST CSF clearly  indicates that organizations planning to implement it can use their existing processes and place  them on top of the NIST CSF to identify gaps with respect to the framework. This implies the  comprehensiveness of the NIST CSF when compared with other frameworks such as COBIT,  ISO/IEC 27001 and ISF Standard of Good Practices (SoGP). Thus, to ensure applicable  alignment with any information security framework, we need to confirm the comprehensiveness  or identify any possible gap in NIST CSF.  52 Computer Science & Information Technology (CS & IT)  However, in this paper, we show that NIST CSF is not comprehensive to address all information  security related processes that are addressed in some of those frameworks. The main objective of  the framework is to manage cyber security risks within the organizations that implement it. In the  NIST CSF, the \\Framework Implementation Tiers\" part, referred to as \\Tiers\", is detailed as one  of three parts that the framework consists of [1]. However, the Tiers does not provide  organizations with a mechanism to measure the progress of implementing NIST CSF or their  maturity level and information security processes' capabilities. Tiers is just visionary tool that  allows organizations to understand their cyber security risk management approach and what are  the processes in place to manage the risk. NIST official web site [2] has stated that the Tiers are  not intended to be measurement tool to maturity levels.  This paper is a comprehensive comparison between NIST CSF, COBIT, ISO/IEC 27001 and ISF  frameworks. It identifies the gap of key information security processes that are addressed in some  frameworks but not in NIST CSF. We fill this gap and propose a new capability maturity model  (CMM) to measure NIST CSF implementation progress.  2. OVERVIEW OF THE NIST CYBER SECURITY FRAMEWORK  The NIST CSF consists of three main parts in which, cyber security is considered as a risk that is  managed through the enterprise risk management process [1]. Thus, we identify the NIST CSF  framework as risk-based framework. The three parts are: framework core, risk tiers, and  framework profile.  Table 1: Frameworks Comparison  Framework Control Categories Control Objectives Activities  NIST CSF [1] Functions (5) Categories (22) Subcategories (98)  ISF [3] Categories (4) Areas (26) Topics (118)  ISO27001 (2013) [4] Clauses (14) Control objective (35) Controls (114)  COBIT5 (2013) [5] Domains (5) Processes (37) Practices (210)  2.1 FRAMEWORK CORE  The framework core consists of a set of cyber security activities. These activities are grouped in  \\Subcategories\" which are grouped too in \\Categories\". The categories are sorted in five different  \\Functions\": Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, and Recover. The NIST CSF five functions are  concurrent and continuous. When the functions collectively implemented they form a high-level  and strategic view of the cyber security risk management program. The Framework Core part has  also the desired outcomes (controls objectives) and informative references. Informative  references are list of cyber security activities in standards, guidelines, or practices such as as  COBIT, ISO/IEC 27001 and the ISF SoGP. The comparison between the NIST CSF and other  frameworks will be done on the level of the cyber security activities to ensure that all key  information securities activities are addressed. Table 1 compares the structure of NIST CSF with  the structure of selected sample of frameworks.  Computer Science & Information Technology (CS & IT)  53  2.2 RISK TIERS  The Tiers part of the NIST CSF is a visionary tool that allows organizations to understand their  cyber security risk management approach and what are the processes in place to manage the risk.  Based on the identified processes in place, the organization may be classified in one of four tier  levels. The tier levels range from \\Partial\" in Tier 1,\\Risk Informed\" in Tier 2, \\Repeatable\" in  Tier 3, to \\Adaptive\" in Tier 4.  2.3 FRAMEWORK PROFILE  The framework profile, referred to as \\profile\", is a tool to document, implement, and track the  organizations' opportunities for improving their cyber security posture. The profile has the current  cyber security activities implemented by the organization, as well as the planned activities to be  implemented in order to close the gap between the current and the \\to-be\" state. Organizations  need to identify which cyber security activities are needed to improve the current state based on  risk assessment to identify risks that may prevent achieving the business objectives.  3. RELATED WORK  We reviewed the \\Baldrige Excellence Framework\" and \\Baldrige Excellence Builder\" at NIST  website [6]. We found that these two documents were not introduced to serve as Maturity Model.  However, they are a continues effort linked to the Tiers, where the main aim is to help  organizations to evaluate how effective is their cyber security risk management effort. The  Baldrige Excellence Builder links the cyber security program with several areas such as  leadership, customers, employees, and the outcome results. In [7], the authors proposed a method  to select measures which evaluate the gap between the current and the target states based on the  NIST CSF risk Tiers. In [8], on the other hand, the authors highlighted the need for Compliance  Assessment in order to reduce the gap in the Processes pillar (one of three pillars including  Human Resources and Technology). Therefore, they proposed a model that is generic to allow for  overall compliance evaluation.  4. NIST CSF EVALUATION  NIST CSF, as a framework, has the following nature:  • Focus on information security high-level requirements.  • Applicable for the development of information security program and policy  Examples of other frameworks include, COBIT, ISO/IEC 27001 and the ISF SoGP for  Information Security. However, the detailed cyber security activities are usually listed in  standards, guidelines, and practices. They have the following nature:  • Focus on information security technical and functional controls (customizable).  • Applicable for developing checklists and conducting compliance/audit assessments.  Examples of standards and guidelines include NIST SP 800-53, ISO-27001 Annex, and ISF  SoGP. The NIST CSF has mapped number of standards in the informative references. The  mapped standards include NIST SP 800 series, COBIT 5, ISA 62443, ISO/IEC 27001:2013, and  54 Computer Science & Information Technology (CS & IT)  CCS [1]. ISF SoGP was not mapped in the NIST CSF framework. Therefore, we will use the ISF  SoGP mapping [9] to NIST CSF to conduct the comparison with NIST CSF.  NIST CSF clearly indicates that organizations planning to implement it can use their existing  processes and place them on top of the NIST CSF to identify gaps with respect to the framework  [1]. However, this assumes that NIST CSF will be comprehensive and adopted framework will be  always equal or less than NIST. This is illustrated in Figure 1-a.  Of course the other scenario of NIST CSF being not comprehensive and has a gap when  compared with other frameworks is possible. In order to verify this scenario (illustrated in Figure  1-b), we matched all mapped CSF informative references with the corresponding framework.  Numeric statistics of this match are as follows:  Framework  CSF  Gap  Gap %  -----------------------------------------------  ISO 27001  93  21  18.4%  ISF  49  69  58.5%  COBIT5  165  45  21.4%  Figure 1: Two gap scenarios for CSF being comprehensive  We found that the compliance process is one gap area, related to information security, that is  identified and need to be addressed in future update to NIST CSF. For example, MEA03  (Monitor, Evaluate and Assess Compliance with External Requirements) is a COBIT process that  is not mapped to NIST CSF. Also, SI2.3 (Monitoring Information Security Compliance) is ISF  process that is not mapped to NIST CSF. In addition, ISO/IEC 27001 has one process (A.18:  Compliance) that is partially mapped to NIST CSF. NIST CSF has mapped only the following  five ISO/IEC processes: A.18.1 (Compliance with legal and contractual requirements), A.18.1.3  (Protection of records), A.18.1.4 (Privacy and protection of personally identifiable information),  A.18.2.2 (Compliance with security policies and standards), and A.18.2.3 (Technical compliance  review).  We traced the Compliance Assessment in NIST 800 series and found two main publications ([10]  and [11]) that highlighted this topic. The Compliance Assessment was addressed under the Risk  Monitoring process, roles and responsibilities associated with it. The two main objectives of the  Risk Monitoring process are to verify the existence of the control (Compliance) and the efficiency  Computer Science & Information Technology (CS & IT)  55  of the control to mitigate the risk [11]. Compliance assessment is very essential to ensure that  identified control to mitigate the risk is implemented correctly and operating as intended. For  detailed responsibilities of each role in the compliance process refer to the following in [10]:  Role  Reference [10]  -------------------------------------------------------------------  Info. system owner  Sec. D.9, Page D-5  Info. system security officer  Sec. D.10, Page D-6  info. security architect  sec. D.11, Page D-6  security control assessor  sec. D.13, Page D-7  We propose to add the compliance assessment process as a process in NIST CSF (be the category  number 23). This category will contain the missed subcategories highlighted previously. The  process should at least contain the following as subcategories:  • Legal and Regulatory Compliance  • Information Privacy  • Intellectual property  • Compliance with security policies and standards  5. MEASURING MATURITY OF ORGANIZATIONS IMPLEMENTING NIST  CSF  The profile part of the NIST CSF is focused on tracking the organization progress in implement-  ing the gaps to move from the current state to the defined target. NIST CSF has provided the  Tiers as visionary tool that allows organizations to understand their cyber security risk  characteristics. However, as we highlighted in Section 1, Tiers does not provide organizations  with a mechanism to measure the progress of implementing NIST CSF or their maturity level and  information security processes capabilities.  Therefore, a maturity model is needed to measure the information security processes capabilities.  The main objective of such maturity model is to identify a baseline to start improving the security  posture of an organization when implementing NIST CSF. The maturity model then is used in  cycles to build consensus, set the priorities of investment in information security, and after all  measure the implementation progress [12]. Some of the frameworks that we studied come with  maturity model (like COBIT and ISF). For other frameworks that do not have maturity model like  ISO 27001, other information security related maturity models like ONG C2M2 and SSE MM are  used (Figures 2 and 3). We studied the different maturity models to verify if they map to each  other in order to utilize any of them to measure the maturity of organizations implementing NIST  CSF. The main focus of our study was to compare the scale used by each model and the domains  evaluated by each model.  We reviewed the four maturity models SSE CMM [13], ONG C2M2 [14], ISF MM [15], and  COBIT PAM MM [16]. Unlike the other three maturity models, ONG C2M2 is three scale model  and assesses ten domains. Refer to Figure 2.  56 Computer Science & Information Technology (CS & IT)  Figure 2: ONG C2M2 Maturity Model scales and domains  Figure 3: SSE Maturity Model scales and domains  While SSE CMM (Figure 3), ISF MM (Figure 4) and PAM MM (Figure 5) are the same scale  maturity models, yet the problem of mapping exists. In Table 2, we identified that level 2  \\Planned and Tracked\" of SSE CMM is not mapped to any of the other maturity models. Figure 3  illustrates the levels and domains of SSE CMM. On the other hand, in ISF MM and PAM MM,  level 2 and 3 is the opesite of each other. Figures 4 and 5 illustrate the levels and domains of ISF  MM and PAM MM.  Figure 4: ISF Maturity Model scales and domains  Computer Science & Information Technology (CS & IT)  57  Figure 5: PAM Maturity Model scales and domains  We performed a comprehensive comparison of all the domains in the four maturity models. These  domains are carefully examined in an attempt to verify the applicability of any maturity model  regardless of the deployed framework. However, our study shows the lack of one-to-one mapping  or any clear way to map these domains in an applicable way. There are items in certain models  that are mapped to multiple items in other models. While other items have no mapping as show in  Table 3. For example, \\Monitor Posture\" in SSE CMM is mapped to three items in ISF MM, three  items in PAM, and two items in ONG C2M2. While \\Monitor and Control Technical Effort\" in  SSE CMM and \\Manage Operation\" in PAM have no mapping in ISF MM and ONG C2M2.  Moreover, the \\Administer Security Controls\" in SSE MM is mapped to seven items in PAM  MM.  Table 2: Maturity Models Scale Comparison  SSE CMM [13] ISF MM [15] COBIT PAM [16] ONG C2M2 [14]  L1  Performed Informally  L1  Performed  L1  Performed Process  L1  Performed but Ad-hoc  L2  Planned and Tracked  No Mapping No Mapping No Mapping  L3  Well Defined  L2  Planned  L3  Established Process  L2  Defined and Resourced  No Mapping L3  Managed  L2  Managed Process  L3  Governed and  Effectively Resourced  L4  Quantitatively Controlled  L4  Measured  L4  Predictable Process  No Mapping  L5 Tailored L5  Continuously Improving  L5  Optimizing Process  No Mapping  Our study, as summarized in Tables 2 and 3, illustrates the mapping of ONG C2M2 with the  other three maturity models in Table 2. It shows that ONG C2M2 has similarity and map to the  first three levels of the ISF MM (Figure 4). However, there is a gap in the assessed areas due to  the difference in the number of both maturity models (10 assessed areas in ONG C2M2 versus 21  in ISF MM). There are assessed areas in ISF MM which are not mapped to ONG C2M2 such as  \\Compliance\", \\Security Audit\", \\Security Architecture\", and \\Secure Application Development\".  Other areas of ONG C2M2 are mapped to more than one area in ISF MM. For example, \\Cyber  security Program Management\" in ONG C2M2 was mapped to three areas in ISF MM,  namely,\\Security Strategy\", \\Security Governance\", and \\Security Policy\".  58 Computer Science & Information Technology (CS & IT)  Table 3: Maturity Models Domains Comparison  Computer Science & Information Technology (CS & IT)  59  6. PROPOSED INFORMATION SECURITY MATURITY MODEL  In the previous sections, we discussed few critical issues about NIST CSF framework. In order to  understand the importance of a new cabability maturity modle for the NIST CSF, we highlight the  following factors:  • The need for business management to measure the maturity of the security program to  assure the reliability of the IT services enabling and supporting their business [12].  • NIST CSF framework tiers are not intended to be measurement tool to maturity levels  [2].  • The identified gap in NIST CSF.  • The lack of (one-to-one) mapping in both scale levels and the assessed areas of the  different existing maturity modules.  Taking into considerations all the above factors, there is a need to define a new CMM for NIST  CSF. Therefore, we propose a five-level scale with 23 assessed areas as shown in Figure 6. Our  suggested assessed areas are shown in Table 4. These areas are the 22 in NIST CSF categories  plus the compliance assessment (No. 6 in Table 4).  Three of the four maturity models we compared are five-level scales in addition of other five  information security related maturity models reviewed by [12]. This supports our decision to  make the proposed maturity model a five-level scale. However, detailed review of the required  scale characteristics, such as the scale levels, scale level definitions, or scale measures (staged  versus continuous), need to be addressed in future work.  The proposed ISMM will enable the organizations to measure their implementation progress over  time. They will use the same measuring tool in a regular basis to ensure maintaining the desired  security posture. Furthermore, using the same measuring tool by different organizations will  allow the benchmarking between those organizations [12].  60 Computer Science & Information Technology (CS & IT)  Table 4: The 23 assessed areas of the proposed maturity model  1 Asset Management  2 Business Environment  3 Governance  4 Risk Assessment  5 Risk Management Strategy  6 Compliance  Assessment  7 Access Control  8 Awareness and Training  9 Data Security  10 Information Protection Processes and Procedures  11 Maintenance  12 Protective Technology  13 Anomalies and Events  14 Security Continuous Monitoring  15 Detection Processes  16 Response Planning  17 Response Communications  18 Response Analysis  19 Response Mitigation  20 Response Improvements  21 Recovery Planning  22 Recovery Improvements  23 Recovery Communications  Figure 6: Proposed Information Security Maturity Model (ISMM)  7. CONCLUSION  NIST CSF has been introduced to organizations with critical infrastructure as an integrated  framework to implement in order to improve their security postures. The NIST recommended to  use the framework on top of and to complement any implemented framework within the  organization. The ongoing enhancement nature of the information security programs drives the  organizations to continuously measure their capabilities of achieving the desired outcome of the  Computer Science & Information Technology (CS & IT)  61  implemented framework. The organizations use the capability maturity models to evaluate their  capabilities. This will give the management of the organization the bases of their decisions to  define and prioritize their investment strategy in building the information security.  This paper considered the evaluation of the NIST CSF comprehensiveness to ensure that it will  cover any existing framework. Moreover, the paper reviewed number of maturity models to  assess the applicability to use with NIST CSF and the existence of mapping between the NIST  CSF control objectives and the assessed areas. The paper used three information security related  frameworks (ISO 27001, ISF, and COBIT5) and four maturity models (ISF, PAM, SSE CMM,  and ONG C2M2).  The review considered the mapping made by NIST CSF to other frameworks and confirmed that  the NIST CSF did not adequately address the compliance assessment process. The evaluation of  the maturity models considered the scale levels definitions and the assessed areas. In both  dimensions, there was no one-to-one mapping between the different maturity models. Therefore,  we concluded that none of the evaluated maturity models can be used with NIST CSF to have a  wide coverage and mapping to implemented framework. The paper proposed a new maturity  model of five-level scale and include the twenty two NISCT CSF categories with addition of the  compliance assessment process.  As for the future work, first, this paper shows the comparison between the assessed areas in  different maturity models, but it did not compare them with the NIST CSF. This comparison is  important to identify which maturity model can be used as a bases to define the scale levels of the  proposed NIST CSF maturity model. The scope of the comparison also needs to be expanded to  cover more cyber security and information security related maturity models such as the  Community Cyber Security Maturity Model [17] and the Information Security Governance model  [12]. Second, the current best practice of the information security business structure needs to be  considered to resort the 23 assessed areas according to that structure grouping areas performed in  one entity together. For example, business processes like the asset management, change  management, threat monitoring, or risk management might be used to group related NIST CSF  categories.

OVERVIEW OF THE NIST CYBER SECURITY FRAMEWORK  The NIST CSF consists of three main parts in which, cyber security is considered as a risk that is  managed through the enterprise risk management process [1]. Thus, we identify the NIST CSF  framework as risk-based framework. The three parts are: framework core, risk tiers, and  framework profile.

NIST CSF clearly indicates that organizations planning to implement it can use their existing  processes and place them on top of the NIST CSF to identify gaps with respect to the framework  [1]. However, this assumes that NIST CSF will be comprehensive and adopted framework will be  always equal or less than NIST. This is illustrated in Figure 1-a.  Of course the other scenario of NIST CSF being not comprehensive and has a gap when  compared with other frameworks is possible. In order to verify this scenario (illustrated in Figure  1-b), we matched all mapped CSF informative references with the corresponding framework.  Numeric statistics of this match are as follows:  Framework  CSF  Gap  Gap %  -----------------------------------------------  ISO 27001  93  21  18.4%  ISF  49  69  58.5%  COBIT5  165  45  21.4%  Figure 1: Two gap scenarios for CSF being comprehensive  We found that the compliance process is one gap area, related to information security, that is  identified and need to be addressed in future update to NIST CSF. For example, MEA03  (Monitor, Evaluate and Assess Compliance with External Requirements) is a COBIT process that  is not mapped to NIST CSF. Also, SI2.3 (Monitoring Information Security Compliance) is ISF  process that is not mapped to NIST CSF. In addition, ISO/IEC 27001 has one process (A.18:  Compliance) that is partially mapped to NIST CSF. NIST CSF has mapped only the following  five ISO/IEC processes: A.18.1 (Compliance with legal and contractual requirements), A.18.1.3  (Protection of records), A.18.1.4 (Privacy and protection of personally identifiable information),  A.18.2.2 (Compliance with security policies and standards), and A.18.2.3 (Technical compliance  review).  We traced the Compliance Assessment in NIST 800 series and found two main publications ([10]  and [11]) that highlighted this topic. The Compliance Assessment was addressed under the Risk  Monitoring process, roles and responsibilities associated with it. The two main objectives of the  Risk Monitoring process are to verify the existence of the control (Compliance) and the efficiency  Computer Science & Information Technology (CS & IT)  55  of the control to mitigate the risk [11]. Compliance assessment is very essential to ensure that  identified control to mitigate the risk is implemented correctly and operating as intended. For  detailed responsibilities of each role in the compliance process refer to the following in [10]:  Role  Reference [10]  -------------------------------------------------------------------  Info. system owner  Sec.

D.13, Page D-7  We propose to add the compliance assessment process as a process in NIST CSF (be the category  number 23). This category will contain the missed subcategories highlighted previously. The  process should at least contain the following as subcategories:  • Legal and Regulatory Compliance  • Information Privacy  • Intellectual property  • Compliance with security policies and standards  5. MEASURING MATURITY OF ORGANIZATIONS IMPLEMENTING NIST  CSF  The profile part of the NIST CSF is focused on tracking the organization progress in implement-  ing the gaps to move from the current state to the defined target. NIST CSF has provided the  Tiers as visionary tool that allows organizations to understand their cyber security risk  characteristics. However, as we highlighted in Section 1, Tiers does not provide organizations  with a mechanism to measure the progress of implementing NIST CSF or their maturity level and  information security processes capabilities.  Therefore, a maturity model is needed to measure the information security processes capabilities.  The main objective of such maturity model is to identify a baseline to start improving the security  posture of an organization when implementing NIST CSF. The maturity model then is used in  cycles to build consensus, set the priorities of investment in information security, and after all  measure the implementation progress [12]. Some of the frameworks that we studied come with  maturity model (like COBIT and ISF). For other frameworks that do not have maturity model like  ISO 27001, other information security related maturity models like ONG C2M2 and SSE MM are  used (Figures 2 and 3). We studied the different maturity models to verify if they map to each  other in order to utilize any of them to measure the maturity of organizations implementing NIST  CSF. The main focus of our study was to compare the scale used by each model and the domains  evaluated by each model.  We reviewed the four maturity models SSE CMM [13], ONG C2M2 [14], ISF MM [15], and  COBIT PAM MM [16]. Unlike the other three maturity models, ONG C2M2 is three scale model  and assesses ten domains. Refer to Figure 2.  56 Computer Science & Information Technology (CS & IT)  Figure 2: ONG C2M2 Maturity Model scales and domains  Figure 3: SSE Maturity Model scales and domains  While SSE CMM (Figure 3), ISF MM (Figure 4) and PAM MM (Figure 5) are the same scale  maturity models, yet the problem of mapping exists. In Table 2, we identified that level 2  \\Planned and Tracked\" of SSE CMM is not mapped to any of the other maturity models. Figure 3  illustrates the levels and domains of SSE CMM. On the other hand, in ISF MM and PAM MM,  level 2 and 3 is the opesite of each other. Figures 4 and 5 illustrate the levels and domains of ISF  MM and PAM MM.  Figure 4: ISF Maturity Model scales and domains  Computer Science & Information Technology (CS & IT)  57  Figure 5: PAM Maturity Model scales and domains  We performed a comprehensive comparison of all the domains in the four maturity models. These  domains are carefully examined in an attempt to verify the applicability of any maturity model  regardless of the deployed framework. However, our study shows the lack of one-to-one mapping  or any clear way to map these domains in an applicable way. There are items in certain models  that are mapped to multiple items in other models. While other items have no mapping as show in  Table 3. For example, \\Monitor Posture\" in SSE CMM is mapped to three items in ISF MM, three  items in PAM, and two items in ONG C2M2. While \\Monitor and Control Technical Effort\" in  SSE CMM and \\Manage Operation\" in PAM have no mapping in ISF MM and ONG C2M2.  Moreover, the \\Administer Security Controls\" in SSE MM is mapped to seven items in PAM  MM.  Table 2: Maturity Models Scale Comparison  SSE CMM [13] ISF MM [15] COBIT PAM [16] ONG C2M2 [14]  L1  Performed Informally  L1  Performed  L1  Performed Process  L1  Performed but Ad-hoc  L2  Planned and Tracked  No Mapping No Mapping No Mapping  L3  Well Defined  L2  Planned  L3  Established Process  L2  Defined and Resourced  No Mapping L3  Managed  L2  Managed Process  L3  Governed and  Effectively Resourced  L4  Quantitatively Controlled  L4  Measured  L4  Predictable Process  No Mapping  L5 Tailored L5  Continuously Improving  L5  Optimizing Process  No Mapping  Our study, as summarized in Tables 2 and 3, illustrates the mapping of ONG C2M2 with the  other three maturity models in Table 2. It shows that ONG C2M2 has similarity and map to the  first three levels of the ISF MM (Figure 4). However, there is a gap in the assessed areas due to  the difference in the number of both maturity models (10 assessed areas in ONG C2M2 versus 21  in ISF MM). There are assessed areas in ISF MM which are not mapped to ONG C2M2 such as  \\Compliance\", \\Security Audit\", \\Security Architecture\", and \\Secure Application Development\".  Other areas of ONG C2M2 are mapped to more than one area in ISF MM. For example, \\Cyber  security Program Management\" in ONG C2M2 was mapped to three areas in ISF MM,  namely,\\Security Strategy\", \\Security Governance\", and \\Security Policy\".  58 Computer Science & Information Technology (CS & IT)  Table 3: Maturity Models Domains Comparison  Computer Science & Information Technology (CS & IT)  59  6. PROPOSED INFORMATION SECURITY MATURITY MODEL  In the previous sections, we discussed few critical issues about NIST CSF framework. In order to  understand the importance of a new cabability maturity modle for the NIST CSF, we highlight the  following factors:  • The need for business management to measure the maturity of the security program to  assure the reliability of the IT services enabling and supporting their business [12].  • NIST CSF framework tiers are not intended to be measurement tool to maturity levels  [2].  • The identified gap in NIST CSF.  • The lack of (one-to-one) mapping in both scale levels and the assessed areas of the  different existing maturity modules.  Taking into considerations all the above factors, there is a need to define a new CMM for NIST  CSF. Therefore, we propose a five-level scale with 23 assessed areas as shown in Figure 6. Our  suggested assessed areas are shown in Table 4. These areas are the 22 in NIST CSF categories  plus the compliance assessment (No. 6 in Table 4).  Three of the four maturity models we compared are five-level scales in addition of other five  information security related maturity models reviewed by [12]. This supports our decision to  make the proposed maturity model a five-level scale. However, detailed review of the required  scale characteristics, such as the scale levels, scale level definitions, or scale measures (staged  versus continuous), need to be addressed in future work.  The proposed ISMM will enable the organizations to measure their implementation progress over  time. They will use the same measuring tool in a regular basis to ensure maintaining the desired  security posture. Furthermore, using the same measuring tool by different organizations will  allow the benchmarking between those organizations [12].  60 Computer Science & Information Technology (CS & IT)  Table 4: The 23 assessed areas of the proposed maturity model  1 Asset Management  2 Business Environment  3 Governance  4 Risk Assessment  5 Risk Management Strategy  6 Compliance  Assessment  7 Access Control  8 Awareness and Training  9 Data Security  10 Information Protection Processes and Procedures  11 Maintenance  12 Protective Technology  13 Anomalies and Events  14 Security Continuous Monitoring  15 Detection Processes  16 Response Planning  17 Response Communications  18 Response Analysis  19 Response Mitigation  20 Response Improvements  21 Recovery Planning  22 Recovery Improvements  23 Recovery Communications  Figure 6: Proposed Information Security Maturity Model (ISMM)  7. CONCLUSION  NIST CSF has been introduced to organizations with critical infrastructure as an integrated  framework to implement in order to improve their security postures. The NIST recommended to  use the framework on top of and to complement any implemented framework within the  organization. The ongoing enhancement nature of the information security programs drives the  organizations to continuously measure their capabilities of achieving the desired outcome of the  Computer Science & Information Technology (CS & IT)  61  implemented framework. The organizations use the capability maturity models to evaluate their  capabilities. This will give the management of the organization the bases of their decisions to  define and prioritize their investment strategy in building the information security.  This paper considered the evaluation of the NIST CSF comprehensiveness to ensure that it will  cover any existing framework. Moreover, the paper reviewed number of maturity models to  assess the applicability to use with NIST CSF and the existence of mapping between the NIST  CSF control objectives and the assessed areas. The paper used three information security related  frameworks (ISO 27001, ISF, and COBIT5) and four maturity models (ISF, PAM, SSE CMM,  and ONG C2M2).  The review considered the mapping made by NIST CSF to other frameworks and confirmed that  the NIST CSF did not adequately address the compliance assessment process. The evaluation of  the maturity models considered the scale levels definitions and the assessed areas. In both  dimensions, there was no one-to-one mapping between the different maturity models. Therefore,  we concluded that none of the evaluated maturity models can be used with NIST CSF to have a  wide coverage and mapping to implemented framework. The paper proposed a new maturity  model of five-level scale and include the twenty two NISCT CSF categories with addition of the  compliance assessment process.  As for the future work, first, this paper shows the comparison between the assessed areas in  different maturity models, but it did not compare them with the NIST CSF. This comparison is  important to identify which maturity model can be used as a bases to define the scale levels of the  proposed NIST CSF maturity model. The scope of the comparison also needs to be expanded to  cover more cyber security and information security related maturity models such as the  Community Cyber Security Maturity Model [17] and the Information Security Governance model  [12]. Second, the current best practice of the information security business structure needs to be  considered to resort the 23 assessed areas according to that structure grouping areas performed in  one entity together. For example, business processes like the asset management, change  management, threat monitoring, or risk management might be used to group related NIST CSF  categories.

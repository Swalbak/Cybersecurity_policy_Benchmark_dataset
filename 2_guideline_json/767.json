As such, restricting administrative privileges forms part of the Essential Eight from the Strategies to Mitigate  Cyber Security Incidents.  This publication provides guidance on how to effectively restrict administrative privileges.  Why administrative privileges should be restricted  Users with administrative privileges for operating systems and applications are able to make significant changes to their  configuration and operation, bypass critical security settings and access sensitive information. Domain administrators  have similar abilities for an entire network domain, which usually includes all of the workstations and servers on the  network.  Adversaries often use malicious code (also known as malware) to exploit security vulnerabilities in workstations and  servers. Restricting administrative privileges makes it more difficult for an adversary’s malicious code to elevate its  privileges, spread to other hosts, hide its existence, persist after reboot, obtain sensitive information or resist removal  efforts.  An environment where administrative privileges are restricted is more stable, predictable, and easier to administer and  support, as fewer users can make significant changes to their operating environment, either intentionally or  unintentionally.  Approaches which do not restrict administrative  privileges  There are a number of approaches which, while they may appear to provide many of the benefits of restricting  administrative privileges, do not meet the intent of this mitigation strategy, and in some cases may actually increase  the risk to an organisation’s network. These approaches include:   simply minimising the total number of privileged accounts   implementing shared non-attributable privileged accounts   temporarily allocating administrative privileges to user accounts   placing standard user accounts in user groups with administrative privileges.

To reduce the risks of using privileged accounts, organisations should ensure that:   technical controls prevent privileged accounts from undertaking risky activities such as reading emails and  opening attachments or browsing the web   system administration is undertaken in a secure manner by implementing the guidance in the Secure  Administration publication.

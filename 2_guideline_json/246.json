With attacks growing in both volume and sophistication, ISACs  could help identify attacks and help contain them, and potentially prevent disasters such as the  Petya/NotPetya (1) situations. In order for this to happen these ISACs need to be able to  communicate with each other and share valuable and actionable information. For this purpose  this report aims to identify the skills, exercises and training needed to ensure that this  information exchange is effective and efficient.  In this report we identify five EU ISACs from the following sectors:  • finance  • rail  • energy  • maritime  • government (ISAC for Cities).  They participated in a survey and interviews to identify their needs and expectations as to how  cross-sectoral information exchange could take place. From our analysis we identified the  following skills needed for cross-sectoral exchange through ISACs:  • technical skills – related to tools for sharing information;  • legal and compliance skills – the regulatory environment applicable to threat  information exchange;  • information analysis and triage skills – knowledge on validating the received threat  intelligence information;  • knowledge on recognising threats.  In addition, in developing a cross-sectoral exercise we identified:  • potential stakeholders,  • the preferred type of exercise, for example organisational,  • the preferred subject of the exercise, for example the incident response,  • potential exercise scenarios, for example the third-party / vendor attack.  In the report we also discuss the challenges that ISACs face when dealing with this type of  exercise, such as the human resources and permissions from the top management needed.

OBJECTIVE AND SCOPE  The objectives of the work presented in this report were to:  • understand if a cybersecurity skills gap exists within the various information sharing  and analysis centres (ISACs), with a focus on information exchange;  • understand the nature of the skills gap (if it exists) and determine how training and/or  exercises can effectively address it;  • identify the need for and characteristics of a possible cross-sectoral exercise;  • propose a set of concrete actions to effectively address the skills gap and needs of the  ISACs in this area.  1.2.  METHODOLOGY  In order to successfully address the objectives of this study, the project team devised a  methodology comprising the following four steps.  1. Literature review. During this stage, relevant documentation on cybersecurity  information exchange methods, activities, tools and challenges was reviewed. The aim  of this step was to provide substantiated information for the implementation of the next  steps.  2. Structured survey. A survey was created based on the results of the literature review  and adapted according to the specific requirements of this study and the interested  parties.  3. ‘Deep dive’ interviews. The survey was followed up with several interviews in order to  get a deep-dive perspective on ISACs’ scope of work, organisation, key challenges,  obstacles and expectations on cross-sectoral ISAC exercises. The aim of the deep- dive interviews was not to reiterate the responses to the survey, but rather to build on  this information in order to obtain more suitable recommendations.  4. Analysis of the results and extraction of conclusions. All the information gathered  from the previous steps was collated, analysed and evaluated in order to provide the  recommendations in this report on skills demand, exercise structure and resources  needed and communities’ interaction.  The structure of the report follows the steps of the methodology described above.  The deep-dive interviews enabled additional discussions with the survey respondents, to clarify  their responses and elaborate on their points of view. This way, additional information was  gathered on more specific points. The points from respondents highlighted in this report are  anonymised and are not presented in a specific order.  The deep-dive interviews were structured as follows: respondents were asked for some  information about the context in which their ISAC operates, their responses to the questionnaire  were discussed and they were asked to provide additional feedback on their points of view.  1.3. SURVEY INFORMATION  The questionnaire was sent to a predetermined list of stakeholders, all of which were directly  involved in the activities of ISACs. The questionnaire was constructed and communicated using  the EUSurvey tool.  CROSS-SECTOR EXERCISE REQUIREMENTS  March 2022  7  The questionnaire was open between 7 June and 1 July 2021. The deep-dive interviews were  conducted between 17 June and 15 July 2021.  Questionnaire responses were received from EU ISACs from various sectors (financial, energy,  rail, maritime, aviation and municipal administration). More than 70 % of the participants  declared their willingness to participate in the deep-dive interviews, of whom 80 % were  conducted in order to better understand the context of areas covered by the survey.  CROSS-SECTOR EXERCISE REQUIREMENTS  March 2022  8  2. GENERAL CONTEXT  As explained in Section 1.2 ‘Methodology’, a survey was conducted using a structured  questionnaire followed by several deep-dive interviews.  In the following sections, the questionnaire responses and feedback are analysed by section,  providing a statistical representation of the responses provided along with the context retrieved  during the deep-dive interviews (e.g. specificities mentioned by participants and key takeaways  for constructing conclusions and recommendations).  2.1.  WHAT IS A EUROPEAN UNION INFORMATION SHARING AND  ANALYSIS CENTRE?  ISACs (2) are non-profit organisations that provide a central resource for gathering information  on cyberthreats (in many cases to critical infrastructure); allow the two-way sharing of  information between the private and the public sectors about root causes, incidents and threats;  and allow the sharing of experience, knowledge and analysis.  Information sharing, either between national stakeholders or in cross-country cases, is an  important aspect of cybersecurity. Knowledge on attackers’ methods and tools, ongoing attacks,  victims and protective measures, incident response, mitigation measures and preparatory  controls can be shared between the relevant stakeholders.  An EU ISAC is characterised as an ISAC whose member companies are from at least two EU  Member States.  Currently, there is a limited number of EU ISACs, but the plan is to develop such entities for  various sectors. Some of these sectors include:  • Industry 4.0 and industry and control systems,  • energy systems and smart grids,  • transport (road, rail, air, sea and space),  • finance, e-payments and insurance,  • public services, e-government and digital citizenship,  • healthcare,  • smart cities and smart buildings (convergence of digital services for citizens) and other  utilities,  • telecommunications, the media and content.  As information sharing is a core function of ISACs, it is of paramount importance that the  relevant actions are identified that will enhance and support the information exchange  capabilities of ISACs.  2.2.  OVERVIEW OF INFORMATION SHARING AND ANALYSIS CENTRES  In this section of the questionnaire, information about the origins of the participants and the  specific restrictions on information sharing was requested.  Figure 1 provides the distribution of the respondents among the various ISACs:  (2) https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/national-cyber-security-strategies/information-sharing  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/national-cyber-security-strategies/information-sharing  CROSS-SECTOR EXERCISE REQUIREMENTS  March 2022  9  Figure 1: Respondents’ affiliations  Regarding the possible restrictions on information sharing, 46 % of the respondents identified  restrictions imposed by the parameters in Figure 2.  Figure 2: Restrictions on information sharing  1  1  1  4  2  1  3  0 1 2 3 4 5  Aborted European Aviation ISAC  European City ISAC (I4C+)  European Energy (EE) ISAC  European Financial (FI) ISAC  European Maritime (EM) ISAC  European Rail (ER) ISAC  Financial Services (FS-ISAC)  Number of respondents per ISAC  IS AC  S  3  1  1  1  1  1  5  1  0 1 2 3 4 5 6  Banking regulations  Competition regulation  NIS  Rules of conduct  The information  The TLP  GDPR  Other legal restrictions (e.g. within the terms of reference)  Number of votes per restriction  R es  tr ic  tio ns  CROSS-SECTOR EXERCISE REQUIREMENTS  March 2022  10  As shown in Figure 2, more than 30 % of the respondents (including from the European Rail  ISAC, the European Financial ISAC and the Financial Services ISAC) identified the General  Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) as imposing restrictions. This clearly indicates a need to  provide guidelines with regard to compliance with the GDPR while sharing information.  It is crucial to the entire information-sharing process that obstacles are identified and removed in  order to facilitate effective information exchange.  2.2.1.  Overview by sector  In addition to the general impressions obtained from the interviews, two sectors stood out  because their ISACs were able to provide additional information of interest.  Finance  The finance sector is clearly ahead of the other sectors when it comes to cybersecurity. It has  been highly regulated for a significant amount of time, longer than the other sectors, and with a  wider spectrum of regulations (Basel I, Basel II and Basel III; the Payment Card Industry Data  Security Standard (3); and payment services directive 2) that include cybersecurity-related fraud  treatment.  The finance sector has reached such a significant maturity level that it is able to provide threat  landscape monitoring. The ISACs are also interested in technical exercises and training.  As such, the sector stands out as being able to inform other sectors with regard to cross-sector  IT vulnerabilities, attacks and incidents, and could be in a position to take the lead and help the  other sectors reinforce their skill sets.  Although it traditionally focuses on IT operation, the mechanisation of business functions (e.g.  the development of automated teller machines that are vulnerable to physical attacks) (4) may  create new needs for operational technology (OT). Cross-collaboration with other sectors that  have a long history of deploying OT in the field (e.g. energy and transport) could help mitigate  these threats.  Transport  Cybersecurity in transport is very new. Although the transport sector has not been targeted as  much as other sectors by cyberattacks, there are indications that they will, like others, become a  more frequent target. Good examples are attacks on ticketing systems (5) such as MyFare and  digitalised train control systems (6).  The transport sector is focusing on OT and relies on other sectors for IT-related information  sharing. For example, ticketing machines and information systems are like banking terminals, so  there is a clear benefit of exchanging information with the finance and telecommunications  sectors.  Owing to its focus on OT, the ISAC needs to also include providers of technological equipment,  as they can supply a lot of information on their devices.

STRUCTURE OF INFORMATION SHARING AND ANALYSIS  CENTRES  The structure of the ISACs is relatively similar. They generally consist of a partnership between  private and public entities, sometimes hosted within a public entity. The partnership can be  formal (with an established legal entity) or informal. Some of them were established very  recently, while others have been operating (e.g. in the form of CERTs) for a long time.  ISACs cater to two populations: C-level executives and technical people. Most of the  participants and recipients of information are C-level executives, and they are the focus of ISAC  participation. Technical people support C-level executives as needed.  Several ISACs use the Malware Information Sharing Platform (MISP) or similar platforms, or  need or would like to do so but do not yet have the capability. Others prefer more traditional  means of communication, such as emails and factsheets. Situational awareness is important but  unfortunately is lacking in many ISACs.  Several ISACs already practice information exchange and have networks of collaborators  around Europe. Others are just starting to do so and are interested in benefiting from the  experiences of previously established organisations with higher maturity levels.  In relation to the challenges of information exchange, the following points were made.  • ‘There is often a large amount of information to manipulate, which requires strong  capabilities. There is a trade-off between timeliness and correctness. The information  exchanged should be correct, but one should not wait too long to communicate  because then the recipient may not have the time to leverage the exchanged  information to react to the threat.’  • ‘Information-sharing processes are informal in some cases. One of the key points is  trust, trusting the persons and organisations with which you exchange information.’  • ‘The ISACs face difficulties when talking to victims, as they need to help victims defend  themselves efficiently while at the same time extracting information from them to share  with the rest of the community. Gathering information uses resources, so the trade-off  between providing help and collecting data is delicate.’  2.4.  EXPERIENCES OF AND PREFERENCES FOR EXERCISES  ISACs that participated in the interviews reported their experiences and their positive attitudes  towards exercises.  The ISACs generally differentiated between two types of exercise:  • table top exercises focused on processes,  • red-team / blue-team exercises aimed at testing the defences of specific organisations.  When asked about the shortcomings and challenges relating to exercises, ISACs gave the  following main feedback.  • ISACs may face resource issues in their daily tasks, so participation in exercises  should be weighted. Resource constraints particularly affect the analysis of the  information that ISACs collect.  • Time needs to be invested in the preparation and planning phase of training for the  training to be effective. Therefore, human resources and especially people who have  the relevant knowledge should be involved early on.  CROSS-SECTOR EXERCISE REQUIREMENTS  March 2022  12  • Exercising and testing should not be implemented only once. There should be  continuity in exercises and training (i.e. past exercises should be leveraged to prepare  and create new exercises).  CROSS-SECTOR EXERCISE REQUIREMENTS  March 2022  13  3. KNOWLEDGE AND SKILLS  NEEDED BY INFORMATION  SHARING AND ANALYSIS  CENTRES  3.1.  SKILLS ANALYSIS FROM THE SURVEY  The aim of this section was to identify the knowledge and skills that are needed by the members  of each ISAC in order to effectively exchange information between them and to identify the  respondents’ preferred ways of implementing the necessary training.  Respondents were asked to grade a range of types of knowledge and skills (from organisational  to technical) based on their importance to their ISAC. Moreover, the respondents were given the  opportunity to add their own suggestions using an open-text question.  The proposed knowledge and skills were derived from the literature review and were:  • knowledge of threats (e.g. indicators of compromise (IoC), common vulnerabilities and  exposures (CVE), and other relevant naming schemes);  • knowledge of applicable legal and regulatory compliance requirements affecting threat  information exchange (e.g. data retention, attribution, personally identifiable  information (PII) and cross-border prohibitions);  • knowledge of data sanitisation requirements and techniques;  • knowledge of the specifics of service-level agreements (SLAs), non-disclosure  agreements (NDAs) and other agreements in place within the ISAC (describing the  responsibilities of its members and participating organisations);  • knowledge of sharing designations (e.g. the Traffic Light Protocol (TLP));  • applied knowledge of industry standards related to the threat information exchange  (e.g. Trusted Automated eXchange of Indicator Information (TAXII), Structured Threat  Information eXpression (STIX), Cyber Observable eXpression (CybOX) and the  Collective Intelligence Framework (CIF));  • applied knowledge of security measures that must be implemented to secure  information exchange (e.g. encryption and transfer protocols);  • knowledge of validating the received threat intelligence information (making sure that it  is of high quality, actionable, accurate, relevant and specific);  • knowledge of internal procedures for incident handling (if sensitive data is leaked);  • risk assessment methodologies and tools utilised to classify the information received;  • tools for sharing information (e.g. MISP).  Different sectors have different preferences for knowledge and skills, as shown in Figures 3 and 4. The information  obtained for the finance and transport sectors was more representative than that obtained for other sectors, as we  received more responses for these sectors. There was not enough information to analyse the skills of EU ISACs from  other sectors, although this information is captured in the overall analysis of skills, as described in Section 3.6  ‘Summary’.  CROSS-SECTOR EXERCISE REQUIREMENTS  March 2022  14  3.1.1.  Finance sector information sharing and analysis centres  The finance sector ISACs include the European Financial ISAC and the European branch of the  US Financial Services ISAC.  Based on the responses obtained, the finance ISACs value most the knowledge of applicable legal and regulatory  compliance requirements affecting threat information exchange (Figure 3). This could be because the finance industry  is one of the most regulated industries and compliance affects information sharing. Knowledge of validating the  received threat intelligence information was the second most valuable skill mentioned. This could be because there is  an enormous amount of threat intelligence information and being able to manage that is a valuable skill. The second  least valuable skill was that associated with knowledge of internal procedures for incident handling, which could be  because the industry is well aware of what needs to be done in the event of an incident. This could also be because  the industry has been dealing with cybersecurity incidents for some time. Applied knowledge of security measures that  must be implemented to secure information exchange, for example using encryption and secure transfer protocols,  was the least valuable skill reported. This could be because for some time the finance industry has been well aware of  how to secure communications coming from payment transactions.

Transport sector ISACs  The transport sector ISACs include the maritime, rail and aviation ISACs.  The transport sector has a different view on skills from the financial sector. The most valuable skills are associated  with the knowledge of threats (Figure 4). This could be associated with the fact that threats are still difficult to identify,  because they can affect not only IT, but also OT. Therefore, identifying threats affecting transport systems is  considered one of the most valuable skills to the industry. The second most valuable skill is the same as in the finance  sector – validating the received threat intelligence. It seems that the wealth of threat intelligence information available  to the sectors is not easily manageable. Therefore, ISACs should focus on developing this skill in the future. Skills  associated with a knowledge of data sanitisation and secure information exchange are least valuable. It seems that  ISACs in the transport sector have covered the basics of secure communication exchange, and that these skills are  not required at this point in time.  Figure 4: Knowledge and skills in the transport sector  15,52% 13,79% 13,79%  12,07% 12,07% 10,34%  8,62%  5,17% 5,17% 3,45%  0,00% 0,00% 0,00%  2,00%  4,00%  6,00%  8,00%  10,00%  12,00%  14,00%  16,00%  18,00%  Pe rc  en ta  ge  o  f r es  po nd  en ts  CROSS-SECTOR EXERCISE REQUIREMENTS  March 2022  16  3.2.  LEGAL AND COMPLIANCE SKILLS  Respondents reported that the most important knowledge required is that of the regulatory  environment applicable to threat information exchange. This, combined with the responses  related to risk assessments and SLAs/NDAs, indicates that the highest-ranking skill set for EU  ISAC operators is related to the legal and compliance framework. (Survey results: ‘applicable  legal and regulatory compliance requirement’ – 33 points, rank 1; ‘risk assessment’ – 12 points,  rank 6; and ‘SLA/NDA’ – 10 points, rank 7.)  Why is this skill set important?  As mentioned in Section 2.2, one of the major obstacles to information sharing identified by the  survey participants is legal and regulatory obligations. Therefore, having concrete knowledge of  the relevant requirements, how these may affect information sharing and how information  sharing could be implemented in compliance with them is of paramount importance.  In more detail, this skill set includes the following.  • EU ISAC operators must understand and be able to apply the EU legal framework  related to the directive on security of network and information systems, which  mandates that information about cyberthreats and cyberincidents be made available to  certain parties.  • Operators must understand and be able to apply the EU legal framework related to the  GDPR, which mandates that personal information should be protected. Incident-related  information often includes personal data. Processes should be put in place to allow the  sharing of information that is valuable to all involved parties, without compromising the  protection of the personal data of the data subject. These processes should be  constructed in such a way that the main goals of information exchange are achieved  along with GDPR compliance (e.g. the sender of the information retains the ability to  correctly classify the information shared and the receiver of the information can  manage the received information according to its classification and treat it accordingly).  • Operators must understand and be able to apply risk assessment methodologies.  Compliance with legal and regulatory requirements is connected with risk assessment.  Risk assessment is applicable to the early stages of information sharing (during the  information classification process) and in the last stages during information handling  and sharing by the recipient. Especially for the latter, owing to the differences in  environments in which the ISACs operate, cross-sector information exchange also  requires that the information is independently assessed by the receiving party to add  further protection and classification if needed.  • Operators must have the knowledge, understanding and ability to understand and  comply with SLAs and NDAs in place between ISACs to support information exchange.  This skill includes having knowledge of the other parties’ structures and of the  procedures that will be deployed in relation to information exchange.  In the context of cross-ISAC skills, a mutual understanding of the regulations applicable to each  of the domains in which the ISACs are operating may be beneficial to ISAC employees.  3.3.  INFORMATION ANALYSIS AND TRIAGE SKILLS  The second most important skill highlighted by the survey was knowledge in validating the  received threat intelligence information. This, combined with the responses related to threat  information and naming schemes and sharing designations, indicates that the second-highest- ranking skill set for EU ISAC operators is related to information analysis and triage. As ISACs  are by nature information exchange points, it is crucial that ISAC members have strong  informational skills. (Survey results: ‘information validation’ – 31 points, rank 2; ‘knowledge of  threats’ – 25 points, rank 3; and ‘knowledge of the TLP’ – 19 points, rank 5.)  CROSS-SECTOR EXERCISE REQUIREMENTS  March 2022  17  Why is this skill set important?  For information exchange to be effective and the desired goals to be achieved, it is important  that the personnel involved have the ability to identify and understand the content and value of  the information received and apply the appropriate processes.  During interviews, many interviewees mentioned that they were interacting with C-level  executives. This skill set should therefore include a significant component related to the ability  to communicate with C-level executives, ensuring that they understand the issues and are  properly informed to make decisions in their own organisations.  This skill set includes information quality assessment, which is the core work of ISACs and  therefore a core skill for ISAC employees. During the information quality assessment, the  receiving party should assess various aspects of the information received, especially the  trustworthiness of the source, its accuracy, its actionability and its relevance, and implement  timely, suitable and specific actions.  • Trustworthiness of the source. One of the key elements of the quality assessment is  the determination of the trustworthiness of the source of the information. If the source  is not reputable or trusted, the information received should be viewed as such and if  desired special validation processes should be implemented before any further  decisions are implemented.  • Accuracy of the information. Information exchanged must be accurate to be  actionable. ISAC employees must have the ability to evaluate the accuracy of the  information received. In this context, the relevant personnel will need to evaluate the  mechanisms through which the information has been collected, stored and transmitted,  and contextual information about the source. This is closely related to the TLP and the  various tools used.  • Actionability of the information. Information exchanged must be actionable, both for  the ISAC and its constituency. The ISAC personnel involved in information sharing  should have the knowledge and skills to decide if the information received should be  shared, how it should be shared, and whether it should be associated with  recommendations (and, if so, which ones). The above are closely related to the  existence of knowledge of the threats, their naming conventions and their relative  criticality.  • Relevance of the information. Information exchanged must be of interest to the  organisations or industry sector receiving it. In the context of cross-ISAC information  exchange, the ISAC personnel involved in information sharing must be able to  understand the needs of their peers in other sectors and decide if the information  collected is relevant to them. This usually requires predetermined and jointly  negotiated criteria for information of interest, and ISAC employees should be trained  on the use of these criteria.  • Specific actions. The information must be sufficiently precise to enable the receiving  ISAC to act on it. As with relevance, this requires predetermined and jointly negotiated  criteria for information of interest, and the ISAC personnel involved in information  sharing should be trained on the use of these criteria.  • Timely actions. Timeliness is of the utmost importance for information sharing.  Information shared too late has limited value for the ISAC’s constituency. Information  shared too early may be incomplete or inaccurate. The ISAC personnel involved in  information sharing must decide if the quantity and stability of the information collected  is sufficient to make sharing relevant to the other ISACs.  In general, the ISAC personnel involved in information sharing must be able to decide when to  invest in harvesting and analysing information about a specific incident before sharing, and  when to stop gathering information and investing in communication and analysis. This is a  CROSS-SECTOR EXERCISE REQUIREMENTS  March 2022  18  difficult trade-off and experience helps in the honing of this skill. The related knowledge and  skills are prime candidates for interactive learning and hands-on exercises.  3.4.  TECHNICAL SKILLS FOR SHARING INFORMATION  The fourth most important set of skills highlighted by the survey were those related to tools for  sharing information. This, combined with the responses regarding the information  representation standards and languages and the data sanitisation techniques, indicates that an  important skill set for EU ISAC operators is related to tools that facilitate the accurate and  efficient exchange of information. As cybersecurity is a highly technological domain, technical  skills were expected to be important for the proper exchange and handling of information.  (Survey results: ‘knowledge of tools for information sharing’ – 23 points, rank 4; ‘knowledge of  information representation standards and languages’ – 6 points, rank 8; ‘data sanitisation  requirements and techniques’ – 5 points, rank 9; and ‘specific cybersecurity standards’ –  5 points, rank 9.)  Why is this skill set important?  As mentioned in Section 3.3, information involved in exchanges between ISACs should possess  specific high-quality characteristics, and the exchange of information should be implemented in  accordance with specific time limitations, in order for the information to be effective for and  valuable to all involved parties. This combination of requirements has led to the increased  utilisation (or desirability) of specific tools (e.g. MISP). Knowledge of the correct, effective and  efficient use of these tools and the implementation of the actions required to process  information (incoming or outgoing) is needed by the ISAC personnel involved in information  sharing.  As there are a number of tools available, and because effective training can be implemented  only if focused on a specific tool, the survey included a question regarding participants’  preferences for tools (Figure 5).  Figure 5: Preferences for tools  The relatively high preference for MISP may be attributed to the fact that, during the interviews,  several parties mentioned their desire to use MISP (either by choice or owing to pressure from  their constituency), or that they have deployed a MISP instance that is not yet in full production.  In addition, several ISACs are closely cooperating with CERTs, and MISP is clearly the tool of  choice for many of the CERTs in Europe.  In more detail, this skill set includes the following.  6,25%  37,50%  6,25%  12,50%  6,25%  31,25%  0,00% 5,00% 10,00% 15,00% 20,00% 25,00% 30,00% 35,00% 40,00%  HELK  MISP  N6  OPENCTI  Some analytic tool (i2, Palantir etc)  YARA  Percentage of respondents  CROSS-SECTOR EXERCISE REQUIREMENTS  March 2022  19  • MISP. MISP is a complex tool. The ISAC personnel involved in information sharing  must be able to filter information relevant to cross-sector analysis. This involves  personnel having access to and using the right tools and filters (already in place) or  developing and deploying their own filters. The ISAC personnel involved in information  sharing should have a deep understanding of the capabilities and constraints of the  MISP and use it as effectively as possible.  • Standard databases such as CVE, Common Platform Enumeration (CPE) and  MITRE ATT&CK. The ISAC personnel involved in information sharing must leverage  the existing information in these databases, as they provide a common platform for  expressing events of interest. Using these standard databases supports the goals of  information accuracy, relevance and actionability.  o CVE is a dictionary of vulnerabilities, best accessed through the National  Vulnerability Database of the National Institute of Standards and Technology.  CVE provides a common source of information that enables precise identification  of vulnerabilities, ensuring appropriate risk analysis, the identification of  vulnerable systems, impact and potential remediations. Properly tagging with the  appropriate CVE (and CPE) is done by the sender of the information and is key to  the proper handling by the recipient.  o CPE is a dictionary of vulnerable software and hardware products. It provides the  product identification for CVE in the National Institute of Standards and  Technology’s national vulnerability database. It is a key element of CVE, along  with the common vulnerability scoring system.  o MITRE ATT&CK provides a base to enable knowledge about attacker tactics and  techniques to be standardised. It provides a common high-level description of  attacker activities, facilitating information sharing. It proposes mitigation methods  to limit attacker activities when such activities are discovered in an organisation.  • Standard IoC description languages such as YARA. These enable the accurate  configuration of detection sensors with regard to the threat.  o YARA is a tool and language used by malware researchers to search for specific  patterns in files to detect the presence of malware. The YARA language has been  widely adopted to describe indicators of compromise. Using YARA supports the  goals of information accuracy, relevance and actionability.  In the context of cross-ISAC skills, a mutual understanding of the applicable standards in each  of the domains in which the ISACs are operating may be beneficial to the ISAC personnel  involved in information sharing.  In general, the ISAC personnel involved in information sharing must be able to effectively and  efficiently use the agreed tools for information sharing. The related knowledge and skills are  prime candidates to be addressed through interactive learning and hands-on exercises.  3.5.  OTHER SKILLS  The survey also shows that certain skills are less important for ISACs. The skills not ranked are  more ‘generic’ skills that are further away from the core competences of ISACs (e.g. general  intelligence information analytical skills (not tools but frameworks, etc.), communication and  group facilitation skills, and applied knowledge of different security measures to be implemented  to secure information exchange (e.g. encryption and transfer protocols)).  3.6.  SUMMARY  The different ISACs have different knowledge and skills needs.  Table 1 provides a summary of the knowledge and skills needed as reported by the EU ISACs.  CROSS-SECTOR EXERCISE REQUIREMENTS  March 2022  20  Table 1: Ranking of knowledge/skills by importance  Order of  importance Knowledge/skills  Most important Knowledge of applicable legal and regulatory compliance requirements affecting threat  information exchange (e.g. data retention, attribution, PII and cross-border prohibitions)  Knowledge of validating the received threat intelligence information (making sure that it is of  high quality, actionable, accurate, relevant and specific)  Knowledge of threats (e.g. IoC, CVE and other relevant schemes)  Tools for sharing information (e.g. MISP)  Knowledge of sharing designations (e.g. TLP)  Risk assessment methodologies and tools to be utilised for classification of the information  received.  Knowledge of internal procedures for incident handling (if sensitive data is leaked)  Knowledge of the specifics of SLAs, NDAs and other agreements in place within the ISAC  (describing the responsibilities of its members and participating organisations)  Applied knowledge of industry standards related to the threat information exchange (e.g. TAXII,  STIX, CybOX and CIF)  Knowledge of data sanitisation requirements and techniques  Knowledge of newly created railway-specific cybersecurity standards (e.g. IEC62443 deviated  standard and TSI.57001)  General intelligence information analytical skills (not tools but frameworks, etc.)  Communication and group facilitation skills  Knowledge of how to establish trust between the ISACs and their members  Least  important  Applied knowledge of different security measures to be implemented to secure information  exchange (e.g. encryption and transfer protocols)  In conclusion, the following knowledge and skills were identified as most important for the  ISACs in order to facilitate effective information exchange:  • knowledge of applicable legal and regulatory compliance requirements affecting threat  information exchange (e.g. data retention, attribution, PII and cross-border  prohibitions);  • knowledge of validating the received threat intelligence information (making sure that it  is of high quality, actionable, accurate, relevant and specific);  • knowledge of threats (e.g. IoC, CVE and other relevant naming schemes);  • tools for sharing information (e.g. MISP).  Regarding the last point (tools for sharing information), the responses to the question on the tool  that ISACs would like to be trained on were split mostly between MISP (46 %) and YARA  (38 %). They should be considered in different scenarios, however, as MISP is generally  focused on threat and intelligence sharing, while YARA is more focused on malware analysis.  CROSS-SECTOR EXERCISE REQUIREMENTS  March 2022  21  Finally, based on the responses to the question on preferences for training methods, the survey  shows that all the delivery methods were deemed acceptable, with a slight preference for face- to-face training (Figure 6). This preference should be considered during the design of the  relevant training courses.  Figure 6: Preferences for training methods  In summary, the skills required for cross-sector information exchange cover the following.  • Legal and regulatory framework. Beyond regulations that are applicable to all  sectors, understanding of sector-specific regulations and context may be required to  facilitate the exchange of information on cross-sector cyber incidents, indicators of  compromise and early warnings of ongoing malicious activity, among other things.  • Information analysis and triage skills. In the context of cross-sector information  exchange, ISAC operators should be able to rely on pre-negotiated criteria to decide  when a piece of information is relevant to another sector. This should be  complemented by the practical evaluation of the value of the information. Another key  aspect of information analysis is being able to synthesise the information for C-level  decision-makers.  • Technical skills. The required technical skills are quite standard in the ISAC  community and are in general similar to those required by CERT personnel.  25,00%  30,00%  25,00%  20,00%  0,00% 5,00% 10,00% 15,00% 20,00% 25,00% 30,00% 35,00%  blended (remote training containing off line material, videos and remote classroom based training)  face to face training  remote classroom based training  self-paced e-learning course and material  Percentage of respondents  CROSS-SECTOR EXERCISE REQUIREMENTS  March 2022  22  4. CROSS-SECTORAL  EXERCISES  4.1.  REQUIREMENTS FOR CROSS-SECTORAL EXERCISES  In this section we assess the needs and requirements for conducting cross-sectoral ISAC  exercises. The aim is to check what types of exercise, methods of exercise, delivery,  organisation, and resources – those already available and those that need to be  created/developed – would be the most suitable and useful for ISACs, bearing in mind their  stages of development and maturity levels.  For a better understanding and to enhance the survey analysis we introduced several  definitions related to the cyber exercises’ domain in general.  4.1.1.  Stakeholders  Table 2 shows the types of potential stakeholders involved in exercises and descriptions of their  roles and responsibilities. Depending on the type and scope of an exercise, all roles listed below  may or may not be necessary.  Table 2: Exercise Stakeholders Type  Type Description  Sponsors  Sponsors take responsibility for the exercise programme and grant a  clear mandate and full authority to the exercise leadership and design  teams; approve overall programme goals and objectives; advocate within  the organisation to other executives/managers and stakeholders  Leadership  The leadership is responsible for overseeing all aspects of the table top  cyber exercise, using a strategic approach; for assigning resources as  needed and enforcing stakeholders’ commitments; and for tracking the  progress of the action/improvement plan and its enforcement  Planners  The group administratively responsible for planning and executing the  exercise in a realistic manner; for organising the additional resources  required; and for representing all key constituencies, including observers  Facilitators  Facilitators lead participants through the exercise by setting the context  and facilitating discussion to ensure that they remain aligned with the  scope of the exercise within its given time frame  Observers  A limited group that passively witnesses/observes the proceedings and  course of events, taking notes of participants’ actions, decisions and  effectiveness. Its aim is to provide feedback; to assess the preparations  of the organisations or individuals within them; and to learn lessons for  CROSS-SECTOR EXERCISE REQUIREMENTS  March 2022  23  future exercises through after-action reports, which include  recommendations on how to amend plans to address these gaps  Participants / role players  Participants / role players participate or simulate one specific role or  multiple specific roles during exercises and initiate actions to handle,  respond to or mitigate the injects  Very important persons  These are visiting individuals from top management layers of participating  organisations, or third-party organisations with an interest in running  exercises  4.1.2.  Activities  • An exercise is a simulated operation involving planning, preparation and execution that  is carried out for the purpose of training and evaluation.  • Table top exercises are discussion-based sessions where team members meet in an  informal classroom setting to discuss their roles during an emergency and their  responses to a particular emergency situation.  • A hotwash is a debrief conducted immediately after an exercise or test with staff and  participants.  • A cold debrief is a post-exercise activity where individuals or teams are provided with  feedback sometime after the exercise, including improvements that can be made to  processes and outcomes, and potentially an action plan. Such feedback usually  involves the use of objective performance data.  4.1.3.  Deliverables  • An exercise scenario describes the strategic and operating environment in sufficient  scope and detail to allow the accomplishment of the exercise and training objectives.  • An after-action review is an analytical review of training events that enables the training  audience, through a facilitated professional discussion, to examine actions and results  during a training event.  • A corrective action report addresses areas of assessment, gaps and corrective actions  to remedy the gaps.  There are several types of cybersecurity exercises, usually depending on the participants’ roles  within their organisations and sponsors’ expectations:  • governance-oriented or organisational exercises, with senior-level involvement, usually  constructed as table top exercises with the goal of confirming the existence of specific  processes and activities and organisations’ level of preparedness;  • operationally oriented exercises, designed to test organisations’ ability to roll out  predefined sets of rules, processes, procedures and tools;  • technically oriented exercises, designed to test and improve highly technical skills  possessed by the ISACs’ technical staff;  • mixed types of exercises that are conducted concurrently or one after the other in a  logical sequence, such as the Cyber Europe sets of exercises (7).  As shown in Figure 7, more than two thirds (above 70 %) of the respondents stressed their  need to participate in high-level organisational (40 %) and operational (35 %) exercises. Some  20 % of respondents signalled their need to organise technical exercises. As concluded from  the interviews, most of the ISACs surveyed are at an early stage of development and are  (7) Cyber Europe has a 2-year cycle and at the time of writing the next exercise is to be held in June 2022.  CROSS-SECTOR EXERCISE REQUIREMENTS  March 2022  24  focused on establishing a clear structure and mandate and trust-building mechanisms, so it is  understandable that they have a need for high-level exercises at this stage of development. In  the natural evolution of any group/entity such as an ISAC, there is a need to conduct both  governance-oriented or organisational exercises, and technical exercises for day-to-day  activities, but structuring is required to reach a high maturity level.  Figure 7: Preferences for types of exercise  Some respondents stressed the need to conduct all levels of exercises at some point and the  need for all exercises to be practical in order to simulate real-world situations and test the  communication mechanisms between ISACs and sectors. Exercises are seen as a way to  validate the models deployed and identify gaps and blind spots in the global processes of  incident handling in ISACs’ communities.  Moreover, cybersecurity is a multidisciplinary domain covering a wide range of topics, aspects  and areas. As it is impossible to cover them all in a single exercise, one of the aims of this  report was to identify the areas or domains of cybersecurity perceived by participants as the  most important to cover in the exercises.  Participants were asked to rate their preferred exercise subjects from 1 to 5, with 1 being the  most preferred and 5 being the least preferred. Results were then analysed according to the  number of votes for each subject and the ratings provided by the participants, and presented as  votes for each subject. As shown in Figure 8, the two subjects with the most votes were  ‘incident response’ and ‘crisis management’, followed by ‘information correlation’ and ‘situational  awareness’. The least important subjects of cross-sectoral exercises, according to the survey,  were ‘reporting to your constituency and getting feedback’ and ‘state emergency response’. The  responses provided and this analysis clearly align with the general mandate of the ISACs as  organisations in which exchanging information during incident management or crisis  management processes is the most important task.  0,00%  5,00%  10,00%  15,00%  20,00%  25,00%  30,00%  35,00%  40,00%  45,00%  Organisational Operational Technical Other  CROSS-SECTOR EXERCISE REQUIREMENTS  March 2022  25  Figure 8: Preferences for domains to be covered in the exercises  NB: SOP, standard operating procedure.  Each exercise is built on an imaginary scenario that can create a stage for testing reactions,  operational procedures and cross-sectoral communities. Unfortunately, the real-world cyber  landscape offers a wide range of scenarios, as the number of attacks and new attack vectors  are constantly rising. Even though real-life cases may well be different from previously run  exercises, the latter will benefit ISACs by training stakeholders and giving them confidence in  the processes and procedures that have been designed, proof-tested, and eventually improved  and updated.  Participants were asked to rate their preferred exercise scenarios from 1 to 5, with 1 being the  most preferred and 5 being the least preferred. Results were then analysed according to the  number of votes for each subject and ratings provided by the participants, and presented as  votes for each subject. As shown in Figure 9, the most preferred exercise scenario was the  ‘attack on key vendors / third parties’, followed by the ‘ransomware attack’ scenario. The least  preferred scenario was ‘false flags’, which is best applied in a mature context. Bearing in mind  that recent global cybersecurity incidents and crises involved vendor / third-party attacks  followed by ransomware deployment (and later extortion), it is clear why the participants chose  this type of attack scenario as the most suitable for a cross-sectoral exercise, as these are  currently considered the most significant global cyberthreats, as mentioned in the various  ENISA threat landscape publications.  0 10 20 30 40 50 60  Reporting to your constituents and … State emergency response  Awareness raising Public relations  Threat landscape widening SOPs and playbooks validation  Situational awareness Information correlation  Crisis management Incident response  Percentage of respondents  CROSS-SECTOR EXERCISE REQUIREMENTS  March 2022  26  Figure 9: Preferences for exercise scenarios  Along with the expectations on cross-sectoral exercises, types and possible scenarios, through  the survey and this report we also aimed to assess the level of preparedness of ISACs to  participate in the exercises. The success and purpose of every exercise fully correlates with the  participants’ level of preparedness and established capabilities. Among the resources  necessary for participating in the exercises, human resources are the most important.  The analysis we conducted based on the survey results shows that this may be the major  obstacle to and challenge in organising large-scale cross-sectoral ISAC exercises (Figure 10).  Almost 40 % of the respondents signalled that their ISAC is ‘currently lacking in human  resources, or expecting workloads that do not permit other activities’. The other 40 % are both  fully equipped and fully skilled regarding human resources to participate in the exercise or have  plans to improve skills in the near future.  Figure 10: Human resources  The respondents also stressed that they would be willing to reallocate their resources as  necessary to participate in the exercises if participating would be of value to their members and  sector.  0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80  False flags  Simulated communication outages & …  DDoS  Compromise/Data breach of Personally …  Specific (cross)-sectorial threats  Ransomware attack  Attack on Key Vendors/Third parties  Percentage of respondents  0  5  10  15  20  25  30  35  40  45  we are fully prepared to participate in an  exercise  we are lacking human resources  other we have limited skills to participate, but we plan to train people  we don't have the skills to participate  Pe rc  en ta  ge  o  f r es  po nd  en ts  Human resources  CROSS-SECTOR EXERCISE REQUIREMENTS  March 2022  27  Preparing, planning and participating in the exercises usually requires taking over some of the  exercise roles. The usual roles and the roles used for the purposes of the survey are shown in  Table 3.  Table 3: Exercise team roles  Team Description  Leadership team Responsible for overseeing all aspects of the table top cyber exercises, using  a strategic approach  Planning team Advises and validates the development of the exercise scenarios / injects  and objectives  Facilitation team Leads participants through the exercises by setting the stage and facilitating  discussion  Observer team  Witnesses the proceedings and events and assesses the preparations of  organisations or individuals within them and gives recommendations on how  their plans can be amended to address gaps  Like the finding that a high percentage of ISACs lack the human resources needed to  participate in cross-sectoral exercises, the analysis of the survey showed that small  percentages of the ISACs surveyed are willing to take leadership (23 %) or planning (23 %)  team roles. In line with this finding, the highest percentage of ISACs (38 %) were willing to take  the least demanding observation team role. This suggests that lack of human resources and  appropriate skills may be a significant obstacle to and challenge in organising cross-sectoral  exercises. However, for an exercise to be fully useful, ISACs should not just observe –  ISAC core team members should do what they would actually do if there was a real  incident/crisis.  When it comes to taking roles in cross-sectoral exercises, almost 90 % of the respondents  described ENISA taking over the leadership, planner or facilitator role. Like the  abovementioned conclusion, for an exercise to fulfil its purpose, ISAC core team  members should be at least planners, with some involvement in facilitation activities too.  Besides the human resources necessary for successful cross-sectoral exercises, there are  other types of resources and activities that can be regarded as prerequisites for establishing a  good basis and exercise environment. For the purpose of this report, we surveyed participants  on the importance of the following resources and activities:  • a dedicated communication platform,  • alternative/backup communication platforms,  • holding initial, midterm and final planning meetings,  • guidelines and instructions,  • ‘getting to know the participants’ sessions.  CROSS-SECTOR EXERCISE REQUIREMENTS  March 2022  28  A large majority of respondents (60 %) reported that holding initial, midterm and final planning  meetings was the most important activity, followed by the existence of a dedicated  communication platform and guidelines and instructions. Besides the listed resources and  activities, participants stressed the need to conduct the exercise using an existing  communication platform and a dedicated table top exercise environment. The aim is to proof- test existing means of communication under stress.  Along with existing human and other resources within ISACs, specific skills and capabilities can  be gained through specialised pre-exercise training:  • dedicated conferences on ISAC exercises,  • specialised training on table top exercises,  • exercise platform training,  • senior-level pre-exercise meetings,  • selected exercise scenario training.  A significant percentage of the respondents (46 %) reported that dedicated conferences on  ISAC exercises were the most useful form of pre-exercise training, followed by senior-level pre- exercise meetings (23 %).  The last aspect in this section of the survey was an assessment of participants’ preferences for  the following debriefing and after-exercise reporting mechanisms:  • hot debrief  • cold debrief  • after-action review  • recommendations  • action plan.  Respondents mostly reported that hot debriefs (38 %) were the most useful post-exercise  activity, followed by recommendations (30 %) and after-action reviews (23 %).  As for whether anonymised executive reports and reports on lessons learned should be shared  with the wider public (e.g. Member State authorities, Computer Security Incident Response  Teams Network and cooperation groups, extending to the global ISAC community – based in  the United States – and to non-EU neighbouring countries, such as the United Kingdom and  European Free Trade Association countries) or exclusively within the participants’ networks,  53 % (7 out of 13) of respondents accepted the possibility of sharing them with the wider public  (Figure 11).  CROSS-SECTOR EXERCISE REQUIREMENTS  March 2022  29  Figure 11: Sharing reports with the wider public  However, sharing such reports depends on the contents and level of confidentially required to  safeguard the contents, which may contain sensitive information on ISACs’ organisation,  structure and procedures. A possible solution is to prepare a sanitised report for sharing with  the wider public and for public relations purposes.  4.2.  INTERACTION CHALLENGES  In this section we assess the current state of play regarding interactions between the  communities and different stakeholders, and possible obstacles or aggravating issues related to  participating in cross-sectoral exercises.  Participating in any kind of exercise is resource consuming and is not a priority for many  organisations. In addition, some organisations may have different kinds of legal, regulatory or  statuary limitations in terms of engaging in this kind of activity. From the information collected  through the survey, 50 % of the respondents need approval for participation but getting approval  should not be an issue, 25 % need approval and are not sure about the final decision, and 25 %  need no approval to participate in a cross-sectoral exercise (Figure 12).  Yes 53,85%  NO 30,77%  Don't know 15,38%  CROSS-SECTOR EXERCISE REQUIREMENTS  March 2022  30  Figure 12: Approval for participating  As for the final outcomes of participating in cross-sectoral exercises, through the survey we  aimed to assess the usefulness of the following specific goals:  • internal awareness raising,  • establishing cross-sectoral connections,  • improving standard operating procedures (SOPs) and strategies,  • identifying weaknesses in internal Restriction of Privileges (RoPs),  • identifying potential gaps in cross-sectoral communication,  • developing the internal skill set.  Some 30 % of respondents saw the goal of identifying potential gaps in cross-sectoral  communication as the most important to be reached, and the goal of establishing cross-sectoral  connections had the same percentage of responses. The goal recognised as least important  was identifying weaknesses in internal RoPs.  Organising and participating in cross-sectoral exercises can be negatively affected by a number  of aggravating issues. As shown in Figure 13, participants recognised a lack of resources and  the fact that planning must be done very much in advance as the most significant among them.  Figure 13: Aggravating issues anticipated  Yes, approval is  needed, but  shuold not be  an issue  50%  NO 25%  Yes, approval is  needed, but  shuold not be  an issue  25%  0,00% 5,00% 10,00% 15,00% 20,00% 25,00% 30,00%  Activities would be out of the scope of …  No experience in exercises  Lack of understanding in the required …  Lack of resources  Planning must be made very much in …  Percentage of voters  CROSS-SECTOR EXERCISE REQUIREMENTS  March 2022  31  However, as shown in Figure 14, when surveyed directly on previous experience of running  and/or participating in any kind of exercises within ISACs (e.g. table top exercises,  communication checks, technical hands-on exercises, internal ISAC exercises, seminars and  workshops), 67 % of respondents declared that they had no experience. All of the participants  with previous experience confirmed that this activity was highly useful for their ISAC and that  important lessons could be learned on the following issues:  • coordination weaknesses,  • how to communicate with the media,  • willingness to share actionable information,  • who should be contacted and involved,  • missing incident response strategies,  • missing ‘automation’ in continuous monitoring,  • missing clarification of roles (Public Private Partnerships PPP, national computer  security incident response team, national banks, regulators, etc.),  • need for communication processes to be improved.  Figure 14: Previous experience of running and/or participating in any kind of exercise within  your ISAC  The last question in this section of the survey asked which stakeholders, besides ISACs, may  be useful as participants in cross-sectoral exercises. Almost 50 % of participants reported that  sectoral authorities are the most important stakeholders to have as participants in cross-sectoral  exercises, followed by national/governmental computer security incident response teams (15 %)  and ENISA (15 %). National security agencies are recognised as the least important  stakeholders in this regard.  4.3.  SUMMARY  The survey provides some clear ideas on what ISACs expect to gain from cross-sectoral  exercises, their levels of preparedness and the possible obstacles to successful exercise  implementation.  ISACs prefer organisational exercises, with the aim of checking and improving their capabilities  in the incident response and crisis management domains. ISACs also prefer exercises related  to the current ‘attack trends’ globally, such as attacks on key vendors and ransomware attacks.  Yes 33%  No 67%  CROSS-SECTOR EXERCISE REQUIREMENTS  March 2022  32  Regarding the human resources that are available and levels of equipment and skill sets,  around half of the ISACs surveyed are well equipped and the other half are lacking in human  resources and are not in a position to carry out new activities such as participating in exercises.  The ISACs surveyed recognise the importance for success of the timely preparation of  exercises, with an initial step being the presentation of the context of the exercise, and planning  in advance using a formal preparation process.  Most of the ISACs surveyed are willing to share the final results of the exercises with the wider  public. Sectoral authorities are seen as the most important stakeholders to include in exercises.  CROSS-SECTOR EXERCISE REQUIREMENTS  March 2022  33  5. CONCLUSIONS AND THE  WAY FORWARD  Using the data collected and the interviews conducted the following conclusions can be drawn.  The conclusions were confirmed through a validation process.  5.1.  CONCLUSIONS  From the questionnaire analysis and interviews, we identified the following common areas of  interest.  • ISACs see training and exercises as excellent opportunities to improve skills.  • The interdependencies between sectors was clearly identified as a key challenge to  address.  • Owing to the heterogeneous maturity levels, there is a clear need to address and  involve C-level executives in information exchange exercises and training. Strategic  aspects of information exchange should be addressed.  • The ISACs see little difficulty in participating in exercises and training organised by  others, on the condition that they have sufficient resources to participate.  • An indirect benefit of organised training and exercises, and learning new skills, is  building trust in the community.  • The ISACs clearly identified that knowledge of applicable legislation is key to dealing  with information exchange.  • Owing to the different levels of maturity, there needs to be a minimum level of technical  and organisational competence to be able to exchange information.  Based on the analysis in this report, the ISACs need to have a minimum level of technical and  organisational skills to participate in cross-sectoral exercises. As identified in this report, at a  minimum, expertise is required in:  • the regulatory environment applicable to threat information exchange;  • validating the received threat intelligence information;  • threat information and naming schemes and sharing designations;  • the use of tools for information sharing.  The skills can be connected with the selected cross-sectoral exercises in the following ways.  Table 4: Connection of skills so to cross-sectoral exercise domains  Exercise domains Skills required  Organisational  • Knowledge of applicable legal and regulatory compliance requirements  affecting threat information exchange (e.g. data retention, attribution,  PII and cross-border prohibitions)  • Knowledge of internal procedures for incident handling (if sensitive  data is leaked)  CROSS-SECTOR EXERCISE REQUIREMENTS  March 2022  34  • Knowledge of the specifics of SLAs, NDAs and other agreements in  place within the ISAC (describing the responsibilities of its members  and participating organisations)  • Knowledge of data sanitisation requirements and techniques  • Communication and group facilitation skills  • Applied knowledge of different security measures to be implemented to  secure information exchange (e.g. encryption and transfer protocols)  Incident response  • Knowledge of validating the received threat intelligence information  (making sure that it is of high quality, actionable, accurate, relevant  and specific).  • Knowledge of threats (e.g. IoC, CVE and other relevant schemes)  • Tools for sharing information (e.g. MISP)  • Knowledge of sharing designations (e.g. TLP)  • Risk assessment methodologies and tools to be utilised to classify the  received information.  • Knowledge of internal procedures for incident handling (if sensitive  data is leaked)  • Knowledge of the specifics of SLAs, NDAs and other agreements in  place within the ISAC (describing the responsibilities of its members  and participating organisations)  • Applied knowledge of industry standards related to threat information  exchange (e.g. TAXII, STIX, CybOX and CIF)  • Knowledge of data sanitisation requirements and techniques  • Communication and group facilitation skills  • Applied knowledge of different security measures to be implemented to  secure the information exchange (e.g. encryption and transfer  protocols)  Crisis management  • Knowledge of applicable legal and regulatory compliance requirements  affecting threat information exchange (e.g. data retention, attribution,  PII and cross-border prohibitions)  • Knowledge of internal procedures for incident handling (if sensitive  data is leaked)  • Knowledge of the specifics of SLAs, NDAs and other agreements in  place within the ISAC (describing the responsibilities of its members  and participating organisations)  • General intelligence information analytical skills (not tools but  frameworks, etc.)  • Communication and group facilitation skills  5.2.  THE WAY FORWARD  Based on the results and the feedback from the ISACs, the cross-sectoral exercise could be an  organisational exercise with a scenario on an incident response attack on a key third party /  vendor.  For the exercise to be successful, the ISACs need to consider the following skills and  organisational and technical steps.  CROSS-SECTOR EXERCISE REQUIREMENTS  March 2022  35  5.2.1.  Skills steps  Having the right skills in the information sharing and analysis community is a firm requirement.  Indeed, being able to recognise a threat, analyse it and propose measures is something that is  essential for the cybersecurity community. It is one thing to be able to share information properly  with the community within the ISAC, and another to be able to share information outside this  community. In many cases, the people in the ISAC community have a certain knowledge of  information threat analysis or information sharing, but they may not always be experienced in  sharing information outside the ISAC, which usually requires skills in understanding the needs  of the other sector the ISAC is sharing the information with.  The EU ISACs should focus their efforts on:  • improving their knowledge of applicable legislation related to information  exchange;  • improving their knowledge of technical skills in information analysis and  exchange.  5.2.2.  Organisational steps  ISACs need to have clearly defined roles to be able to exchange information. Currently, such  roles are not clearly defined. In addition, ISACs should introduce SOPs for sharing information  outside their communities. Therefore, ISACs need to identify and assign specific roles to enable  information exchange to the outside community and follow predefined and tested procedures.  The EU ISACs should focus their efforts on:  • developing proper roles and responsibilities for sharing information outside the  ISAC community;  • developing SOPs for cross-sectoral information sharing;  • exchanging good practices in cross-sectoral information exchange.  In the interviews and in ENISA’s experience, trust is of the utmost importance in information  sharing, especially when sharing with the outside community. The organisation of cross-sectoral  exercises and/or training is a natural way of building trust among the communities. In addition,  to build further trust, staff exchange or cross-participation in ISAC events is beneficial.  5.2.3.  Technical steps  There is a need to test the effectiveness of the steps implemented in response to the  recommendations above (this may also include continuous improvement). This could be done  by introducing cross-sectoral exercises on technical and organisational aspects of information  exchange.  Automation is a key component of effectively and efficiently ingesting technical information such  as IoCs. Accordingly, having a common platform or a platform that supports commonly  supported formats is beneficial, especially for sharing operational information, which has a short  lifespan.  The EU ISACs should focus their efforts on:  • SOP testing and live information exchange testing;  • cross-sectoral training using specific technical tools.

With attacks growing in both volume and sophistication, ISACs  could help identify attacks and help contain them, and potentially prevent disasters such as the  Petya/NotPetya (1) situations. In order for this to happen these ISACs need to be able to  communicate with each other and share valuable and actionable information. For this purpose  this report aims to identify the skills, exercises and training needed to ensure that this  information exchange is effective and efficient.  In this report we identify five EU ISACs from the following sectors:  • finance  • rail  • energy  • maritime  • government (ISAC for Cities).  They participated in a survey and interviews to identify their needs and expectations as to how  cross-sectoral information exchange could take place. From our analysis we identified the  following skills needed for cross-sectoral exchange through ISACs:  • technical skills – related to tools for sharing information;  • legal and compliance skills – the regulatory environment applicable to threat  information exchange;  • information analysis and triage skills – knowledge on validating the received threat  intelligence information;  • knowledge on recognising threats.  In addition, in developing a cross-sectoral exercise we identified:  • potential stakeholders,  • the preferred type of exercise, for example organisational,  • the preferred subject of the exercise, for example the incident response,  • potential exercise scenarios, for example the third-party / vendor attack.  In the report we also discuss the challenges that ISACs face when dealing with this type of  exercise, such as the human resources and permissions from the top management needed.

OBJECTIVE AND SCOPE  The objectives of the work presented in this report were to:  • understand if a cybersecurity skills gap exists within the various information sharing  and analysis centres (ISACs), with a focus on information exchange;  • understand the nature of the skills gap (if it exists) and determine how training and/or  exercises can effectively address it;  • identify the need for and characteristics of a possible cross-sectoral exercise;  • propose a set of concrete actions to effectively address the skills gap and needs of the  ISACs in this area.  1.2.  METHODOLOGY  In order to successfully address the objectives of this study, the project team devised a  methodology comprising the following four steps.  1. Literature review. During this stage, relevant documentation on cybersecurity  information exchange methods, activities, tools and challenges was reviewed. The aim  of this step was to provide substantiated information for the implementation of the next  steps.  2. Structured survey. A survey was created based on the results of the literature review  and adapted according to the specific requirements of this study and the interested  parties.  3. ‘Deep dive’ interviews. The survey was followed up with several interviews in order to  get a deep-dive perspective on ISACs’ scope of work, organisation, key challenges,  obstacles and expectations on cross-sectoral ISAC exercises. The aim of the deep- dive interviews was not to reiterate the responses to the survey, but rather to build on  this information in order to obtain more suitable recommendations.  4. Analysis of the results and extraction of conclusions. All the information gathered  from the previous steps was collated, analysed and evaluated in order to provide the  recommendations in this report on skills demand, exercise structure and resources  needed and communities’ interaction.  The structure of the report follows the steps of the methodology described above.  The deep-dive interviews enabled additional discussions with the survey respondents, to clarify  their responses and elaborate on their points of view. This way, additional information was  gathered on more specific points. The points from respondents highlighted in this report are  anonymised and are not presented in a specific order.  The deep-dive interviews were structured as follows: respondents were asked for some  information about the context in which their ISAC operates, their responses to the questionnaire  were discussed and they were asked to provide additional feedback on their points of view.  1.3. SURVEY INFORMATION  The questionnaire was sent to a predetermined list of stakeholders, all of which were directly  involved in the activities of ISACs. The questionnaire was constructed and communicated using  the EUSurvey tool.  CROSS-SECTOR EXERCISE REQUIREMENTS  March 2022  7  The questionnaire was open between 7 June and 1 July 2021. The deep-dive interviews were  conducted between 17 June and 15 July 2021.  Questionnaire responses were received from EU ISACs from various sectors (financial, energy,  rail, maritime, aviation and municipal administration). More than 70 % of the participants  declared their willingness to participate in the deep-dive interviews, of whom 80 % were  conducted in order to better understand the context of areas covered by the survey.  CROSS-SECTOR EXERCISE REQUIREMENTS  March 2022  8  2. GENERAL CONTEXT  As explained in Section 1.2 ‘Methodology’, a survey was conducted using a structured  questionnaire followed by several deep-dive interviews.  In the following sections, the questionnaire responses and feedback are analysed by section,  providing a statistical representation of the responses provided along with the context retrieved  during the deep-dive interviews (e.g. specificities mentioned by participants and key takeaways  for constructing conclusions and recommendations).  2.1.  WHAT IS A EUROPEAN UNION INFORMATION SHARING AND  ANALYSIS CENTRE?  ISACs (2) are non-profit organisations that provide a central resource for gathering information  on cyberthreats (in many cases to critical infrastructure); allow the two-way sharing of  information between the private and the public sectors about root causes, incidents and threats;  and allow the sharing of experience, knowledge and analysis.  Information sharing, either between national stakeholders or in cross-country cases, is an  important aspect of cybersecurity. Knowledge on attackers’ methods and tools, ongoing attacks,  victims and protective measures, incident response, mitigation measures and preparatory  controls can be shared between the relevant stakeholders.  An EU ISAC is characterised as an ISAC whose member companies are from at least two EU  Member States.  Currently, there is a limited number of EU ISACs, but the plan is to develop such entities for  various sectors. Some of these sectors include:  • Industry 4.0 and industry and control systems,  • energy systems and smart grids,  • transport (road, rail, air, sea and space),  • finance, e-payments and insurance,  • public services, e-government and digital citizenship,  • healthcare,  • smart cities and smart buildings (convergence of digital services for citizens) and other  utilities,  • telecommunications, the media and content.  As information sharing is a core function of ISACs, it is of paramount importance that the  relevant actions are identified that will enhance and support the information exchange  capabilities of ISACs.  2.2.  OVERVIEW OF INFORMATION SHARING AND ANALYSIS CENTRES  In this section of the questionnaire, information about the origins of the participants and the  specific restrictions on information sharing was requested.  Figure 1 provides the distribution of the respondents among the various ISACs:  (2) https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/national-cyber-security-strategies/information-sharing  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/national-cyber-security-strategies/information-sharing  CROSS-SECTOR EXERCISE REQUIREMENTS  March 2022  9  Figure 1: Respondents’ affiliations  Regarding the possible restrictions on information sharing, 46 % of the respondents identified  restrictions imposed by the parameters in Figure 2.  Figure 2: Restrictions on information sharing  1  1  1  4  2  1  3  0 1 2 3 4 5  Aborted European Aviation ISAC  European City ISAC (I4C+)  European Energy (EE) ISAC  European Financial (FI) ISAC  European Maritime (EM) ISAC  European Rail (ER) ISAC  Financial Services (FS-ISAC)  Number of respondents per ISAC  IS AC  S  3  1  1  1  1  1  5  1  0 1 2 3 4 5 6  Banking regulations  Competition regulation  NIS  Rules of conduct  The information  The TLP  GDPR  Other legal restrictions (e.g. within the terms of reference)  Number of votes per restriction  R es  tr ic  tio ns  CROSS-SECTOR EXERCISE REQUIREMENTS  March 2022  10  As shown in Figure 2, more than 30 % of the respondents (including from the European Rail  ISAC, the European Financial ISAC and the Financial Services ISAC) identified the General  Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) as imposing restrictions. This clearly indicates a need to  provide guidelines with regard to compliance with the GDPR while sharing information.  It is crucial to the entire information-sharing process that obstacles are identified and removed in  order to facilitate effective information exchange.  2.2.1.  Overview by sector  In addition to the general impressions obtained from the interviews, two sectors stood out  because their ISACs were able to provide additional information of interest.  Finance  The finance sector is clearly ahead of the other sectors when it comes to cybersecurity. It has  been highly regulated for a significant amount of time, longer than the other sectors, and with a  wider spectrum of regulations (Basel I, Basel II and Basel III; the Payment Card Industry Data  Security Standard (3); and payment services directive 2) that include cybersecurity-related fraud  treatment.  The finance sector has reached such a significant maturity level that it is able to provide threat  landscape monitoring. The ISACs are also interested in technical exercises and training.  As such, the sector stands out as being able to inform other sectors with regard to cross-sector  IT vulnerabilities, attacks and incidents, and could be in a position to take the lead and help the  other sectors reinforce their skill sets.  Although it traditionally focuses on IT operation, the mechanisation of business functions (e.g.  the development of automated teller machines that are vulnerable to physical attacks) (4) may  create new needs for operational technology (OT). Cross-collaboration with other sectors that  have a long history of deploying OT in the field (e.g. energy and transport) could help mitigate  these threats.  Transport  Cybersecurity in transport is very new. Although the transport sector has not been targeted as  much as other sectors by cyberattacks, there are indications that they will, like others, become a  more frequent target. Good examples are attacks on ticketing systems (5) such as MyFare and  digitalised train control systems (6).  The transport sector is focusing on OT and relies on other sectors for IT-related information  sharing. For example, ticketing machines and information systems are like banking terminals, so  there is a clear benefit of exchanging information with the finance and telecommunications  sectors.  Owing to its focus on OT, the ISAC needs to also include providers of technological equipment,  as they can supply a lot of information on their devices.

STRUCTURE OF INFORMATION SHARING AND ANALYSIS  CENTRES  The structure of the ISACs is relatively similar. They generally consist of a partnership between  private and public entities, sometimes hosted within a public entity. The partnership can be  formal (with an established legal entity) or informal. Some of them were established very  recently, while others have been operating (e.g. in the form of CERTs) for a long time.  ISACs cater to two populations: C-level executives and technical people. Most of the  participants and recipients of information are C-level executives, and they are the focus of ISAC  participation. Technical people support C-level executives as needed.  Several ISACs use the Malware Information Sharing Platform (MISP) or similar platforms, or  need or would like to do so but do not yet have the capability. Others prefer more traditional  means of communication, such as emails and factsheets. Situational awareness is important but  unfortunately is lacking in many ISACs.  Several ISACs already practice information exchange and have networks of collaborators  around Europe. Others are just starting to do so and are interested in benefiting from the  experiences of previously established organisations with higher maturity levels.  In relation to the challenges of information exchange, the following points were made.  • ‘There is often a large amount of information to manipulate, which requires strong  capabilities. There is a trade-off between timeliness and correctness. The information  exchanged should be correct, but one should not wait too long to communicate  because then the recipient may not have the time to leverage the exchanged  information to react to the threat.’  • ‘Information-sharing processes are informal in some cases. One of the key points is  trust, trusting the persons and organisations with which you exchange information.’  • ‘The ISACs face difficulties when talking to victims, as they need to help victims defend  themselves efficiently while at the same time extracting information from them to share  with the rest of the community. Gathering information uses resources, so the trade-off  between providing help and collecting data is delicate.’  2.4.  EXPERIENCES OF AND PREFERENCES FOR EXERCISES  ISACs that participated in the interviews reported their experiences and their positive attitudes  towards exercises.  The ISACs generally differentiated between two types of exercise:  • table top exercises focused on processes,  • red-team / blue-team exercises aimed at testing the defences of specific organisations.  When asked about the shortcomings and challenges relating to exercises, ISACs gave the  following main feedback.  • ISACs may face resource issues in their daily tasks, so participation in exercises  should be weighted. Resource constraints particularly affect the analysis of the  information that ISACs collect.  • Time needs to be invested in the preparation and planning phase of training for the  training to be effective. Therefore, human resources and especially people who have  the relevant knowledge should be involved early on.  CROSS-SECTOR EXERCISE REQUIREMENTS  March 2022  12  • Exercising and testing should not be implemented only once. There should be  continuity in exercises and training (i.e. past exercises should be leveraged to prepare  and create new exercises).  CROSS-SECTOR EXERCISE REQUIREMENTS  March 2022  13  3. KNOWLEDGE AND SKILLS  NEEDED BY INFORMATION  SHARING AND ANALYSIS  CENTRES  3.1.  SKILLS ANALYSIS FROM THE SURVEY  The aim of this section was to identify the knowledge and skills that are needed by the members  of each ISAC in order to effectively exchange information between them and to identify the  respondents’ preferred ways of implementing the necessary training.  Respondents were asked to grade a range of types of knowledge and skills (from organisational  to technical) based on their importance to their ISAC. Moreover, the respondents were given the  opportunity to add their own suggestions using an open-text question.  The proposed knowledge and skills were derived from the literature review and were:  • knowledge of threats (e.g. indicators of compromise (IoC), common vulnerabilities and  exposures (CVE), and other relevant naming schemes);  • knowledge of applicable legal and regulatory compliance requirements affecting threat  information exchange (e.g. data retention, attribution, personally identifiable  information (PII) and cross-border prohibitions);  • knowledge of data sanitisation requirements and techniques;  • knowledge of the specifics of service-level agreements (SLAs), non-disclosure  agreements (NDAs) and other agreements in place within the ISAC (describing the  responsibilities of its members and participating organisations);  • knowledge of sharing designations (e.g. the Traffic Light Protocol (TLP));  • applied knowledge of industry standards related to the threat information exchange  (e.g. Trusted Automated eXchange of Indicator Information (TAXII), Structured Threat  Information eXpression (STIX), Cyber Observable eXpression (CybOX) and the  Collective Intelligence Framework (CIF));  • applied knowledge of security measures that must be implemented to secure  information exchange (e.g. encryption and transfer protocols);  • knowledge of validating the received threat intelligence information (making sure that it  is of high quality, actionable, accurate, relevant and specific);  • knowledge of internal procedures for incident handling (if sensitive data is leaked);  • risk assessment methodologies and tools utilised to classify the information received;  • tools for sharing information (e.g. MISP).  Different sectors have different preferences for knowledge and skills, as shown in Figures 3 and 4. The information  obtained for the finance and transport sectors was more representative than that obtained for other sectors, as we  received more responses for these sectors. There was not enough information to analyse the skills of EU ISACs from  other sectors, although this information is captured in the overall analysis of skills, as described in Section 3.6  ‘Summary’.  CROSS-SECTOR EXERCISE REQUIREMENTS  March 2022  14  3.1.1.  Finance sector information sharing and analysis centres  The finance sector ISACs include the European Financial ISAC and the European branch of the  US Financial Services ISAC.  Based on the responses obtained, the finance ISACs value most the knowledge of applicable legal and regulatory  compliance requirements affecting threat information exchange (Figure 3). This could be because the finance industry  is one of the most regulated industries and compliance affects information sharing. Knowledge of validating the  received threat intelligence information was the second most valuable skill mentioned. This could be because there is  an enormous amount of threat intelligence information and being able to manage that is a valuable skill. The second  least valuable skill was that associated with knowledge of internal procedures for incident handling, which could be  because the industry is well aware of what needs to be done in the event of an incident. This could also be because  the industry has been dealing with cybersecurity incidents for some time. Applied knowledge of security measures that  must be implemented to secure information exchange, for example using encryption and secure transfer protocols,  was the least valuable skill reported. This could be because for some time the finance industry has been well aware of  how to secure communications coming from payment transactions.

Transport sector ISACs  The transport sector ISACs include the maritime, rail and aviation ISACs.  The transport sector has a different view on skills from the financial sector. The most valuable skills are associated  with the knowledge of threats (Figure 4). This could be associated with the fact that threats are still difficult to identify,  because they can affect not only IT, but also OT. Therefore, identifying threats affecting transport systems is  considered one of the most valuable skills to the industry. The second most valuable skill is the same as in the finance  sector – validating the received threat intelligence. It seems that the wealth of threat intelligence information available  to the sectors is not easily manageable. Therefore, ISACs should focus on developing this skill in the future. Skills  associated with a knowledge of data sanitisation and secure information exchange are least valuable. It seems that  ISACs in the transport sector have covered the basics of secure communication exchange, and that these skills are  not required at this point in time.  Figure 4: Knowledge and skills in the transport sector  15,52% 13,79% 13,79%  12,07% 12,07% 10,34%  8,62%  5,17% 5,17% 3,45%  0,00% 0,00% 0,00%  2,00%  4,00%  6,00%  8,00%  10,00%  12,00%  14,00%  16,00%  18,00%  Pe rc  en ta  ge  o  f r es  po nd  en ts  CROSS-SECTOR EXERCISE REQUIREMENTS  March 2022  16  3.2.  LEGAL AND COMPLIANCE SKILLS  Respondents reported that the most important knowledge required is that of the regulatory  environment applicable to threat information exchange. This, combined with the responses  related to risk assessments and SLAs/NDAs, indicates that the highest-ranking skill set for EU  ISAC operators is related to the legal and compliance framework. (Survey results: ‘applicable  legal and regulatory compliance requirement’ – 33 points, rank 1; ‘risk assessment’ – 12 points,  rank 6; and ‘SLA/NDA’ – 10 points, rank 7.)  Why is this skill set important?  As mentioned in Section 2.2, one of the major obstacles to information sharing identified by the  survey participants is legal and regulatory obligations. Therefore, having concrete knowledge of  the relevant requirements, how these may affect information sharing and how information  sharing could be implemented in compliance with them is of paramount importance.  In more detail, this skill set includes the following.  • EU ISAC operators must understand and be able to apply the EU legal framework  related to the directive on security of network and information systems, which  mandates that information about cyberthreats and cyberincidents be made available to  certain parties.  • Operators must understand and be able to apply the EU legal framework related to the  GDPR, which mandates that personal information should be protected. Incident-related  information often includes personal data. Processes should be put in place to allow the  sharing of information that is valuable to all involved parties, without compromising the  protection of the personal data of the data subject. These processes should be  constructed in such a way that the main goals of information exchange are achieved  along with GDPR compliance (e.g. the sender of the information retains the ability to  correctly classify the information shared and the receiver of the information can  manage the received information according to its classification and treat it accordingly).  • Operators must understand and be able to apply risk assessment methodologies.  Compliance with legal and regulatory requirements is connected with risk assessment.  Risk assessment is applicable to the early stages of information sharing (during the  information classification process) and in the last stages during information handling  and sharing by the recipient. Especially for the latter, owing to the differences in  environments in which the ISACs operate, cross-sector information exchange also  requires that the information is independently assessed by the receiving party to add  further protection and classification if needed.  • Operators must have the knowledge, understanding and ability to understand and  comply with SLAs and NDAs in place between ISACs to support information exchange.  This skill includes having knowledge of the other parties’ structures and of the  procedures that will be deployed in relation to information exchange.  In the context of cross-ISAC skills, a mutual understanding of the regulations applicable to each  of the domains in which the ISACs are operating may be beneficial to ISAC employees.  3.3.  INFORMATION ANALYSIS AND TRIAGE SKILLS  The second most important skill highlighted by the survey was knowledge in validating the  received threat intelligence information. This, combined with the responses related to threat  information and naming schemes and sharing designations, indicates that the second-highest- ranking skill set for EU ISAC operators is related to information analysis and triage. As ISACs  are by nature information exchange points, it is crucial that ISAC members have strong  informational skills. (Survey results: ‘information validation’ – 31 points, rank 2; ‘knowledge of  threats’ – 25 points, rank 3; and ‘knowledge of the TLP’ – 19 points, rank 5.)  CROSS-SECTOR EXERCISE REQUIREMENTS  March 2022  17  Why is this skill set important?  For information exchange to be effective and the desired goals to be achieved, it is important  that the personnel involved have the ability to identify and understand the content and value of  the information received and apply the appropriate processes.  During interviews, many interviewees mentioned that they were interacting with C-level  executives. This skill set should therefore include a significant component related to the ability  to communicate with C-level executives, ensuring that they understand the issues and are  properly informed to make decisions in their own organisations.  This skill set includes information quality assessment, which is the core work of ISACs and  therefore a core skill for ISAC employees. During the information quality assessment, the  receiving party should assess various aspects of the information received, especially the  trustworthiness of the source, its accuracy, its actionability and its relevance, and implement  timely, suitable and specific actions.  • Trustworthiness of the source. One of the key elements of the quality assessment is  the determination of the trustworthiness of the source of the information. If the source  is not reputable or trusted, the information received should be viewed as such and if  desired special validation processes should be implemented before any further  decisions are implemented.  • Accuracy of the information. Information exchanged must be accurate to be  actionable. ISAC employees must have the ability to evaluate the accuracy of the  information received. In this context, the relevant personnel will need to evaluate the  mechanisms through which the information has been collected, stored and transmitted,  and contextual information about the source. This is closely related to the TLP and the  various tools used.  • Actionability of the information. Information exchanged must be actionable, both for  the ISAC and its constituency. The ISAC personnel involved in information sharing  should have the knowledge and skills to decide if the information received should be  shared, how it should be shared, and whether it should be associated with  recommendations (and, if so, which ones). The above are closely related to the  existence of knowledge of the threats, their naming conventions and their relative  criticality.  • Relevance of the information. Information exchanged must be of interest to the  organisations or industry sector receiving it. In the context of cross-ISAC information  exchange, the ISAC personnel involved in information sharing must be able to  understand the needs of their peers in other sectors and decide if the information  collected is relevant to them. This usually requires predetermined and jointly  negotiated criteria for information of interest, and ISAC employees should be trained  on the use of these criteria.  • Specific actions. The information must be sufficiently precise to enable the receiving  ISAC to act on it. As with relevance, this requires predetermined and jointly negotiated  criteria for information of interest, and the ISAC personnel involved in information  sharing should be trained on the use of these criteria.  • Timely actions. Timeliness is of the utmost importance for information sharing.  Information shared too late has limited value for the ISAC’s constituency. Information  shared too early may be incomplete or inaccurate. The ISAC personnel involved in  information sharing must decide if the quantity and stability of the information collected  is sufficient to make sharing relevant to the other ISACs.  In general, the ISAC personnel involved in information sharing must be able to decide when to  invest in harvesting and analysing information about a specific incident before sharing, and  when to stop gathering information and investing in communication and analysis. This is a  CROSS-SECTOR EXERCISE REQUIREMENTS  March 2022  18  difficult trade-off and experience helps in the honing of this skill. The related knowledge and  skills are prime candidates for interactive learning and hands-on exercises.  3.4.  TECHNICAL SKILLS FOR SHARING INFORMATION  The fourth most important set of skills highlighted by the survey were those related to tools for  sharing information. This, combined with the responses regarding the information  representation standards and languages and the data sanitisation techniques, indicates that an  important skill set for EU ISAC operators is related to tools that facilitate the accurate and  efficient exchange of information. As cybersecurity is a highly technological domain, technical  skills were expected to be important for the proper exchange and handling of information.  (Survey results: ‘knowledge of tools for information sharing’ – 23 points, rank 4; ‘knowledge of  information representation standards and languages’ – 6 points, rank 8; ‘data sanitisation  requirements and techniques’ – 5 points, rank 9; and ‘specific cybersecurity standards’ –  5 points, rank 9.)  Why is this skill set important?  As mentioned in Section 3.3, information involved in exchanges between ISACs should possess  specific high-quality characteristics, and the exchange of information should be implemented in  accordance with specific time limitations, in order for the information to be effective for and  valuable to all involved parties. This combination of requirements has led to the increased  utilisation (or desirability) of specific tools (e.g. MISP). Knowledge of the correct, effective and  efficient use of these tools and the implementation of the actions required to process  information (incoming or outgoing) is needed by the ISAC personnel involved in information  sharing.  As there are a number of tools available, and because effective training can be implemented  only if focused on a specific tool, the survey included a question regarding participants’  preferences for tools (Figure 5).  Figure 5: Preferences for tools  The relatively high preference for MISP may be attributed to the fact that, during the interviews,  several parties mentioned their desire to use MISP (either by choice or owing to pressure from  their constituency), or that they have deployed a MISP instance that is not yet in full production.  In addition, several ISACs are closely cooperating with CERTs, and MISP is clearly the tool of  choice for many of the CERTs in Europe.  In more detail, this skill set includes the following.  6,25%  37,50%  6,25%  12,50%  6,25%  31,25%  0,00% 5,00% 10,00% 15,00% 20,00% 25,00% 30,00% 35,00% 40,00%  HELK  MISP  N6  OPENCTI  Some analytic tool (i2, Palantir etc)  YARA  Percentage of respondents  CROSS-SECTOR EXERCISE REQUIREMENTS  March 2022  19  • MISP. MISP is a complex tool. The ISAC personnel involved in information sharing  must be able to filter information relevant to cross-sector analysis. This involves  personnel having access to and using the right tools and filters (already in place) or  developing and deploying their own filters. The ISAC personnel involved in information  sharing should have a deep understanding of the capabilities and constraints of the  MISP and use it as effectively as possible.  • Standard databases such as CVE, Common Platform Enumeration (CPE) and  MITRE ATT&CK. The ISAC personnel involved in information sharing must leverage  the existing information in these databases, as they provide a common platform for  expressing events of interest. Using these standard databases supports the goals of  information accuracy, relevance and actionability.  o CVE is a dictionary of vulnerabilities, best accessed through the National  Vulnerability Database of the National Institute of Standards and Technology.  CVE provides a common source of information that enables precise identification  of vulnerabilities, ensuring appropriate risk analysis, the identification of  vulnerable systems, impact and potential remediations. Properly tagging with the  appropriate CVE (and CPE) is done by the sender of the information and is key to  the proper handling by the recipient.  o CPE is a dictionary of vulnerable software and hardware products. It provides the  product identification for CVE in the National Institute of Standards and  Technology’s national vulnerability database. It is a key element of CVE, along  with the common vulnerability scoring system.  o MITRE ATT&CK provides a base to enable knowledge about attacker tactics and  techniques to be standardised. It provides a common high-level description of  attacker activities, facilitating information sharing. It proposes mitigation methods  to limit attacker activities when such activities are discovered in an organisation.  • Standard IoC description languages such as YARA. These enable the accurate  configuration of detection sensors with regard to the threat.  o YARA is a tool and language used by malware researchers to search for specific  patterns in files to detect the presence of malware. The YARA language has been  widely adopted to describe indicators of compromise. Using YARA supports the  goals of information accuracy, relevance and actionability.  In the context of cross-ISAC skills, a mutual understanding of the applicable standards in each  of the domains in which the ISACs are operating may be beneficial to the ISAC personnel  involved in information sharing.  In general, the ISAC personnel involved in information sharing must be able to effectively and  efficiently use the agreed tools for information sharing. The related knowledge and skills are  prime candidates to be addressed through interactive learning and hands-on exercises.  3.5.  OTHER SKILLS  The survey also shows that certain skills are less important for ISACs. The skills not ranked are  more ‘generic’ skills that are further away from the core competences of ISACs (e.g. general  intelligence information analytical skills (not tools but frameworks, etc.), communication and  group facilitation skills, and applied knowledge of different security measures to be implemented  to secure information exchange (e.g. encryption and transfer protocols)).  3.6.  SUMMARY  The different ISACs have different knowledge and skills needs.  Table 1 provides a summary of the knowledge and skills needed as reported by the EU ISACs.  CROSS-SECTOR EXERCISE REQUIREMENTS  March 2022  20  Table 1: Ranking of knowledge/skills by importance  Order of  importance Knowledge/skills  Most important Knowledge of applicable legal and regulatory compliance requirements affecting threat  information exchange (e.g. data retention, attribution, PII and cross-border prohibitions)  Knowledge of validating the received threat intelligence information (making sure that it is of  high quality, actionable, accurate, relevant and specific)  Knowledge of threats (e.g. IoC, CVE and other relevant schemes)  Tools for sharing information (e.g. MISP)  Knowledge of sharing designations (e.g. TLP)  Risk assessment methodologies and tools to be utilised for classification of the information  received.  Knowledge of internal procedures for incident handling (if sensitive data is leaked)  Knowledge of the specifics of SLAs, NDAs and other agreements in place within the ISAC  (describing the responsibilities of its members and participating organisations)  Applied knowledge of industry standards related to the threat information exchange (e.g. TAXII,  STIX, CybOX and CIF)  Knowledge of data sanitisation requirements and techniques  Knowledge of newly created railway-specific cybersecurity standards (e.g. IEC62443 deviated  standard and TSI.57001)  General intelligence information analytical skills (not tools but frameworks, etc.)  Communication and group facilitation skills  Knowledge of how to establish trust between the ISACs and their members  Least  important  Applied knowledge of different security measures to be implemented to secure information  exchange (e.g. encryption and transfer protocols)  In conclusion, the following knowledge and skills were identified as most important for the  ISACs in order to facilitate effective information exchange:  • knowledge of applicable legal and regulatory compliance requirements affecting threat  information exchange (e.g. data retention, attribution, PII and cross-border  prohibitions);  • knowledge of validating the received threat intelligence information (making sure that it  is of high quality, actionable, accurate, relevant and specific);  • knowledge of threats (e.g. IoC, CVE and other relevant naming schemes);  • tools for sharing information (e.g. MISP).  Regarding the last point (tools for sharing information), the responses to the question on the tool  that ISACs would like to be trained on were split mostly between MISP (46 %) and YARA  (38 %). They should be considered in different scenarios, however, as MISP is generally  focused on threat and intelligence sharing, while YARA is more focused on malware analysis.  CROSS-SECTOR EXERCISE REQUIREMENTS  March 2022  21  Finally, based on the responses to the question on preferences for training methods, the survey  shows that all the delivery methods were deemed acceptable, with a slight preference for face- to-face training (Figure 6). This preference should be considered during the design of the  relevant training courses.  Figure 6: Preferences for training methods  In summary, the skills required for cross-sector information exchange cover the following.  • Legal and regulatory framework. Beyond regulations that are applicable to all  sectors, understanding of sector-specific regulations and context may be required to  facilitate the exchange of information on cross-sector cyber incidents, indicators of  compromise and early warnings of ongoing malicious activity, among other things.  • Information analysis and triage skills. In the context of cross-sector information  exchange, ISAC operators should be able to rely on pre-negotiated criteria to decide  when a piece of information is relevant to another sector. This should be  complemented by the practical evaluation of the value of the information. Another key  aspect of information analysis is being able to synthesise the information for C-level  decision-makers.  • Technical skills. The required technical skills are quite standard in the ISAC  community and are in general similar to those required by CERT personnel.  25,00%  30,00%  25,00%  20,00%  0,00% 5,00% 10,00% 15,00% 20,00% 25,00% 30,00% 35,00%  blended (remote training containing off line material, videos and remote classroom based training)  face to face training  remote classroom based training  self-paced e-learning course and material  Percentage of respondents  CROSS-SECTOR EXERCISE REQUIREMENTS  March 2022  22  4. CROSS-SECTORAL  EXERCISES  4.1.  REQUIREMENTS FOR CROSS-SECTORAL EXERCISES  In this section we assess the needs and requirements for conducting cross-sectoral ISAC  exercises. The aim is to check what types of exercise, methods of exercise, delivery,  organisation, and resources – those already available and those that need to be  created/developed – would be the most suitable and useful for ISACs, bearing in mind their  stages of development and maturity levels.  For a better understanding and to enhance the survey analysis we introduced several  definitions related to the cyber exercises’ domain in general.  4.1.1.  Stakeholders  Table 2 shows the types of potential stakeholders involved in exercises and descriptions of their  roles and responsibilities. Depending on the type and scope of an exercise, all roles listed below  may or may not be necessary.  Table 2: Exercise Stakeholders Type  Type Description  Sponsors  Sponsors take responsibility for the exercise programme and grant a  clear mandate and full authority to the exercise leadership and design  teams; approve overall programme goals and objectives; advocate within  the organisation to other executives/managers and stakeholders  Leadership  The leadership is responsible for overseeing all aspects of the table top  cyber exercise, using a strategic approach; for assigning resources as  needed and enforcing stakeholders’ commitments; and for tracking the  progress of the action/improvement plan and its enforcement  Planners  The group administratively responsible for planning and executing the  exercise in a realistic manner; for organising the additional resources  required; and for representing all key constituencies, including observers  Facilitators  Facilitators lead participants through the exercise by setting the context  and facilitating discussion to ensure that they remain aligned with the  scope of the exercise within its given time frame  Observers  A limited group that passively witnesses/observes the proceedings and  course of events, taking notes of participants’ actions, decisions and  effectiveness. Its aim is to provide feedback; to assess the preparations  of the organisations or individuals within them; and to learn lessons for  CROSS-SECTOR EXERCISE REQUIREMENTS  March 2022  23  future exercises through after-action reports, which include  recommendations on how to amend plans to address these gaps  Participants / role players  Participants / role players participate or simulate one specific role or  multiple specific roles during exercises and initiate actions to handle,  respond to or mitigate the injects  Very important persons  These are visiting individuals from top management layers of participating  organisations, or third-party organisations with an interest in running  exercises  4.1.2.  Activities  • An exercise is a simulated operation involving planning, preparation and execution that  is carried out for the purpose of training and evaluation.  • Table top exercises are discussion-based sessions where team members meet in an  informal classroom setting to discuss their roles during an emergency and their  responses to a particular emergency situation.  • A hotwash is a debrief conducted immediately after an exercise or test with staff and  participants.  • A cold debrief is a post-exercise activity where individuals or teams are provided with  feedback sometime after the exercise, including improvements that can be made to  processes and outcomes, and potentially an action plan. Such feedback usually  involves the use of objective performance data.  4.1.3.  Deliverables  • An exercise scenario describes the strategic and operating environment in sufficient  scope and detail to allow the accomplishment of the exercise and training objectives.  • An after-action review is an analytical review of training events that enables the training  audience, through a facilitated professional discussion, to examine actions and results  during a training event.  • A corrective action report addresses areas of assessment, gaps and corrective actions  to remedy the gaps.  There are several types of cybersecurity exercises, usually depending on the participants’ roles  within their organisations and sponsors’ expectations:  • governance-oriented or organisational exercises, with senior-level involvement, usually  constructed as table top exercises with the goal of confirming the existence of specific  processes and activities and organisations’ level of preparedness;  • operationally oriented exercises, designed to test organisations’ ability to roll out  predefined sets of rules, processes, procedures and tools;  • technically oriented exercises, designed to test and improve highly technical skills  possessed by the ISACs’ technical staff;  • mixed types of exercises that are conducted concurrently or one after the other in a  logical sequence, such as the Cyber Europe sets of exercises (7).  As shown in Figure 7, more than two thirds (above 70 %) of the respondents stressed their  need to participate in high-level organisational (40 %) and operational (35 %) exercises. Some  20 % of respondents signalled their need to organise technical exercises. As concluded from  the interviews, most of the ISACs surveyed are at an early stage of development and are  (7) Cyber Europe has a 2-year cycle and at the time of writing the next exercise is to be held in June 2022.  CROSS-SECTOR EXERCISE REQUIREMENTS  March 2022  24  focused on establishing a clear structure and mandate and trust-building mechanisms, so it is  understandable that they have a need for high-level exercises at this stage of development. In  the natural evolution of any group/entity such as an ISAC, there is a need to conduct both  governance-oriented or organisational exercises, and technical exercises for day-to-day  activities, but structuring is required to reach a high maturity level.  Figure 7: Preferences for types of exercise  Some respondents stressed the need to conduct all levels of exercises at some point and the  need for all exercises to be practical in order to simulate real-world situations and test the  communication mechanisms between ISACs and sectors. Exercises are seen as a way to  validate the models deployed and identify gaps and blind spots in the global processes of  incident handling in ISACs’ communities.  Moreover, cybersecurity is a multidisciplinary domain covering a wide range of topics, aspects  and areas. As it is impossible to cover them all in a single exercise, one of the aims of this  report was to identify the areas or domains of cybersecurity perceived by participants as the  most important to cover in the exercises.  Participants were asked to rate their preferred exercise subjects from 1 to 5, with 1 being the  most preferred and 5 being the least preferred. Results were then analysed according to the  number of votes for each subject and the ratings provided by the participants, and presented as  votes for each subject. As shown in Figure 8, the two subjects with the most votes were  ‘incident response’ and ‘crisis management’, followed by ‘information correlation’ and ‘situational  awareness’. The least important subjects of cross-sectoral exercises, according to the survey,  were ‘reporting to your constituency and getting feedback’ and ‘state emergency response’. The  responses provided and this analysis clearly align with the general mandate of the ISACs as  organisations in which exchanging information during incident management or crisis  management processes is the most important task.  0,00%  5,00%  10,00%  15,00%  20,00%  25,00%  30,00%  35,00%  40,00%  45,00%  Organisational Operational Technical Other  CROSS-SECTOR EXERCISE REQUIREMENTS  March 2022  25  Figure 8: Preferences for domains to be covered in the exercises  NB: SOP, standard operating procedure.  Each exercise is built on an imaginary scenario that can create a stage for testing reactions,  operational procedures and cross-sectoral communities. Unfortunately, the real-world cyber  landscape offers a wide range of scenarios, as the number of attacks and new attack vectors  are constantly rising. Even though real-life cases may well be different from previously run  exercises, the latter will benefit ISACs by training stakeholders and giving them confidence in  the processes and procedures that have been designed, proof-tested, and eventually improved  and updated.  Participants were asked to rate their preferred exercise scenarios from 1 to 5, with 1 being the  most preferred and 5 being the least preferred. Results were then analysed according to the  number of votes for each subject and ratings provided by the participants, and presented as  votes for each subject. As shown in Figure 9, the most preferred exercise scenario was the  ‘attack on key vendors / third parties’, followed by the ‘ransomware attack’ scenario. The least  preferred scenario was ‘false flags’, which is best applied in a mature context. Bearing in mind  that recent global cybersecurity incidents and crises involved vendor / third-party attacks  followed by ransomware deployment (and later extortion), it is clear why the participants chose  this type of attack scenario as the most suitable for a cross-sectoral exercise, as these are  currently considered the most significant global cyberthreats, as mentioned in the various  ENISA threat landscape publications.  0 10 20 30 40 50 60  Reporting to your constituents and … State emergency response  Awareness raising Public relations  Threat landscape widening SOPs and playbooks validation  Situational awareness Information correlation  Crisis management Incident response  Percentage of respondents  CROSS-SECTOR EXERCISE REQUIREMENTS  March 2022  26  Figure 9: Preferences for exercise scenarios  Along with the expectations on cross-sectoral exercises, types and possible scenarios, through  the survey and this report we also aimed to assess the level of preparedness of ISACs to  participate in the exercises. The success and purpose of every exercise fully correlates with the  participants’ level of preparedness and established capabilities. Among the resources  necessary for participating in the exercises, human resources are the most important.  The analysis we conducted based on the survey results shows that this may be the major  obstacle to and challenge in organising large-scale cross-sectoral ISAC exercises (Figure 10).  Almost 40 % of the respondents signalled that their ISAC is ‘currently lacking in human  resources, or expecting workloads that do not permit other activities’. The other 40 % are both  fully equipped and fully skilled regarding human resources to participate in the exercise or have  plans to improve skills in the near future.  Figure 10: Human resources  The respondents also stressed that they would be willing to reallocate their resources as  necessary to participate in the exercises if participating would be of value to their members and  sector.  0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80  False flags  Simulated communication outages & …  DDoS  Compromise/Data breach of Personally …  Specific (cross)-sectorial threats  Ransomware attack  Attack on Key Vendors/Third parties  Percentage of respondents  0  5  10  15  20  25  30  35  40  45  we are fully prepared to participate in an  exercise  we are lacking human resources  other we have limited skills to participate, but we plan to train people  we don't have the skills to participate  Pe rc  en ta  ge  o  f r es  po nd  en ts  Human resources  CROSS-SECTOR EXERCISE REQUIREMENTS  March 2022  27  Preparing, planning and participating in the exercises usually requires taking over some of the  exercise roles. The usual roles and the roles used for the purposes of the survey are shown in  Table 3.

In line with this finding, the highest percentage of ISACs (38 %) were willing to take  the least demanding observation team role. This suggests that lack of human resources and  appropriate skills may be a significant obstacle to and challenge in organising cross-sectoral  exercises. However, for an exercise to be fully useful, ISACs should not just observe –  ISAC core team members should do what they would actually do if there was a real  incident/crisis.  When it comes to taking roles in cross-sectoral exercises, almost 90 % of the respondents  described ENISA taking over the leadership, planner or facilitator role. Like the  abovementioned conclusion, for an exercise to fulfil its purpose, ISAC core team  members should be at least planners, with some involvement in facilitation activities too.  Besides the human resources necessary for successful cross-sectoral exercises, there are  other types of resources and activities that can be regarded as prerequisites for establishing a  good basis and exercise environment. For the purpose of this report, we surveyed participants  on the importance of the following resources and activities:  • a dedicated communication platform,  • alternative/backup communication platforms,  • holding initial, midterm and final planning meetings,  • guidelines and instructions,  • ‘getting to know the participants’ sessions.  CROSS-SECTOR EXERCISE REQUIREMENTS  March 2022  28  A large majority of respondents (60 %) reported that holding initial, midterm and final planning  meetings was the most important activity, followed by the existence of a dedicated  communication platform and guidelines and instructions. Besides the listed resources and  activities, participants stressed the need to conduct the exercise using an existing  communication platform and a dedicated table top exercise environment. The aim is to proof- test existing means of communication under stress.  Along with existing human and other resources within ISACs, specific skills and capabilities can  be gained through specialised pre-exercise training:  • dedicated conferences on ISAC exercises,  • specialised training on table top exercises,  • exercise platform training,  • senior-level pre-exercise meetings,  • selected exercise scenario training.  A significant percentage of the respondents (46 %) reported that dedicated conferences on  ISAC exercises were the most useful form of pre-exercise training, followed by senior-level pre- exercise meetings (23 %).  The last aspect in this section of the survey was an assessment of participants’ preferences for  the following debriefing and after-exercise reporting mechanisms:  • hot debrief  • cold debrief  • after-action review  • recommendations  • action plan.  Respondents mostly reported that hot debriefs (38 %) were the most useful post-exercise  activity, followed by recommendations (30 %) and after-action reviews (23 %).  As for whether anonymised executive reports and reports on lessons learned should be shared  with the wider public (e.g. Member State authorities, Computer Security Incident Response  Teams Network and cooperation groups, extending to the global ISAC community – based in  the United States – and to non-EU neighbouring countries, such as the United Kingdom and  European Free Trade Association countries) or exclusively within the participants’ networks,  53 % (7 out of 13) of respondents accepted the possibility of sharing them with the wider public  (Figure 11).  CROSS-SECTOR EXERCISE REQUIREMENTS  March 2022  29  Figure 11: Sharing reports with the wider public  However, sharing such reports depends on the contents and level of confidentially required to  safeguard the contents, which may contain sensitive information on ISACs’ organisation,  structure and procedures. A possible solution is to prepare a sanitised report for sharing with  the wider public and for public relations purposes.  4.2.  INTERACTION CHALLENGES  In this section we assess the current state of play regarding interactions between the  communities and different stakeholders, and possible obstacles or aggravating issues related to  participating in cross-sectoral exercises.  Participating in any kind of exercise is resource consuming and is not a priority for many  organisations. In addition, some organisations may have different kinds of legal, regulatory or  statuary limitations in terms of engaging in this kind of activity. From the information collected  through the survey, 50 % of the respondents need approval for participation but getting approval  should not be an issue, 25 % need approval and are not sure about the final decision, and 25 %  need no approval to participate in a cross-sectoral exercise (Figure 12).  Yes 53,85%  NO 30,77%  Don't know 15,38%  CROSS-SECTOR EXERCISE REQUIREMENTS  March 2022  30  Figure 12: Approval for participating  As for the final outcomes of participating in cross-sectoral exercises, through the survey we  aimed to assess the usefulness of the following specific goals:  • internal awareness raising,  • establishing cross-sectoral connections,  • improving standard operating procedures (SOPs) and strategies,  • identifying weaknesses in internal Restriction of Privileges (RoPs),  • identifying potential gaps in cross-sectoral communication,  • developing the internal skill set.  Some 30 % of respondents saw the goal of identifying potential gaps in cross-sectoral  communication as the most important to be reached, and the goal of establishing cross-sectoral  connections had the same percentage of responses. The goal recognised as least important  was identifying weaknesses in internal RoPs.  Organising and participating in cross-sectoral exercises can be negatively affected by a number  of aggravating issues. As shown in Figure 13, participants recognised a lack of resources and  the fact that planning must be done very much in advance as the most significant among them.  Figure 13: Aggravating issues anticipated  Yes, approval is  needed, but  shuold not be  an issue  50%  NO 25%  Yes, approval is  needed, but  shuold not be  an issue  25%  0,00% 5,00% 10,00% 15,00% 20,00% 25,00% 30,00%  Activities would be out of the scope of …  No experience in exercises  Lack of understanding in the required …  Lack of resources  Planning must be made very much in …  Percentage of voters  CROSS-SECTOR EXERCISE REQUIREMENTS  March 2022  31  However, as shown in Figure 14, when surveyed directly on previous experience of running  and/or participating in any kind of exercises within ISACs (e.g. table top exercises,  communication checks, technical hands-on exercises, internal ISAC exercises, seminars and  workshops), 67 % of respondents declared that they had no experience. All of the participants  with previous experience confirmed that this activity was highly useful for their ISAC and that  important lessons could be learned on the following issues:  • coordination weaknesses,  • how to communicate with the media,  • willingness to share actionable information,  • who should be contacted and involved,  • missing incident response strategies,  • missing ‘automation’ in continuous monitoring,  • missing clarification of roles (Public Private Partnerships PPP, national computer  security incident response team, national banks, regulators, etc.),  • need for communication processes to be improved.  Figure 14: Previous experience of running and/or participating in any kind of exercise within  your ISAC  The last question in this section of the survey asked which stakeholders, besides ISACs, may  be useful as participants in cross-sectoral exercises. Almost 50 % of participants reported that  sectoral authorities are the most important stakeholders to have as participants in cross-sectoral  exercises, followed by national/governmental computer security incident response teams (15 %)  and ENISA (15 %). National security agencies are recognised as the least important  stakeholders in this regard.  4.3.  SUMMARY  The survey provides some clear ideas on what ISACs expect to gain from cross-sectoral  exercises, their levels of preparedness and the possible obstacles to successful exercise  implementation.  ISACs prefer organisational exercises, with the aim of checking and improving their capabilities  in the incident response and crisis management domains. ISACs also prefer exercises related  to the current ‘attack trends’ globally, such as attacks on key vendors and ransomware attacks.  Yes 33%  No 67%  CROSS-SECTOR EXERCISE REQUIREMENTS  March 2022  32  Regarding the human resources that are available and levels of equipment and skill sets,  around half of the ISACs surveyed are well equipped and the other half are lacking in human  resources and are not in a position to carry out new activities such as participating in exercises.  The ISACs surveyed recognise the importance for success of the timely preparation of  exercises, with an initial step being the presentation of the context of the exercise, and planning  in advance using a formal preparation process.  Most of the ISACs surveyed are willing to share the final results of the exercises with the wider  public. Sectoral authorities are seen as the most important stakeholders to include in exercises.  CROSS-SECTOR EXERCISE REQUIREMENTS  March 2022  33  5. CONCLUSIONS AND THE  WAY FORWARD  Using the data collected and the interviews conducted the following conclusions can be drawn.  The conclusions were confirmed through a validation process.  5.1.  CONCLUSIONS  From the questionnaire analysis and interviews, we identified the following common areas of  interest.  • ISACs see training and exercises as excellent opportunities to improve skills.  • The interdependencies between sectors was clearly identified as a key challenge to  address.  • Owing to the heterogeneous maturity levels, there is a clear need to address and  involve C-level executives in information exchange exercises and training. Strategic  aspects of information exchange should be addressed.  • The ISACs see little difficulty in participating in exercises and training organised by  others, on the condition that they have sufficient resources to participate.  • An indirect benefit of organised training and exercises, and learning new skills, is  building trust in the community.  • The ISACs clearly identified that knowledge of applicable legislation is key to dealing  with information exchange.  • Owing to the different levels of maturity, there needs to be a minimum level of technical  and organisational competence to be able to exchange information.  Based on the analysis in this report, the ISACs need to have a minimum level of technical and  organisational skills to participate in cross-sectoral exercises. As identified in this report, at a  minimum, expertise is required in:  • the regulatory environment applicable to threat information exchange;  • validating the received threat intelligence information;  • threat information and naming schemes and sharing designations;  • the use of tools for information sharing.  The skills can be connected with the selected cross-sectoral exercises in the following ways.  Table 4: Connection of skills so to cross-sectoral exercise domains  Exercise domains Skills required  Organisational  • Knowledge of applicable legal and regulatory compliance requirements  affecting threat information exchange (e.g. data retention, attribution,  PII and cross-border prohibitions)  • Knowledge of internal procedures for incident handling (if sensitive  data is leaked)  CROSS-SECTOR EXERCISE REQUIREMENTS  March 2022  34  • Knowledge of the specifics of SLAs, NDAs and other agreements in  place within the ISAC (describing the responsibilities of its members  and participating organisations)  • Knowledge of data sanitisation requirements and techniques  • Communication and group facilitation skills  • Applied knowledge of different security measures to be implemented to  secure information exchange (e.g. encryption and transfer protocols)  Incident response  • Knowledge of validating the received threat intelligence information  (making sure that it is of high quality, actionable, accurate, relevant  and specific).  • Knowledge of threats (e.g. IoC, CVE and other relevant schemes)  • Tools for sharing information (e.g. MISP)  • Knowledge of sharing designations (e.g. TLP)  • Risk assessment methodologies and tools to be utilised to classify the  received information.  • Knowledge of internal procedures for incident handling (if sensitive  data is leaked)  • Knowledge of the specifics of SLAs, NDAs and other agreements in  place within the ISAC (describing the responsibilities of its members  and participating organisations)  • Applied knowledge of industry standards related to threat information  exchange (e.g. TAXII, STIX, CybOX and CIF)  • Knowledge of data sanitisation requirements and techniques  • Communication and group facilitation skills  • Applied knowledge of different security measures to be implemented to  secure the information exchange (e.g. encryption and transfer  protocols)  Crisis management  • Knowledge of applicable legal and regulatory compliance requirements  affecting threat information exchange (e.g. data retention, attribution,  PII and cross-border prohibitions)  • Knowledge of internal procedures for incident handling (if sensitive  data is leaked)  • Knowledge of the specifics of SLAs, NDAs and other agreements in  place within the ISAC (describing the responsibilities of its members  and participating organisations)  • General intelligence information analytical skills (not tools but  frameworks, etc.)  • Communication and group facilitation skills  5.2.  THE WAY FORWARD  Based on the results and the feedback from the ISACs, the cross-sectoral exercise could be an  organisational exercise with a scenario on an incident response attack on a key third party /  vendor.  For the exercise to be successful, the ISACs need to consider the following skills and  organisational and technical steps.  CROSS-SECTOR EXERCISE REQUIREMENTS  March 2022  35  5.2.1.  Skills steps  Having the right skills in the information sharing and analysis community is a firm requirement.  Indeed, being able to recognise a threat, analyse it and propose measures is something that is  essential for the cybersecurity community. It is one thing to be able to share information properly  with the community within the ISAC, and another to be able to share information outside this  community. In many cases, the people in the ISAC community have a certain knowledge of  information threat analysis or information sharing, but they may not always be experienced in  sharing information outside the ISAC, which usually requires skills in understanding the needs  of the other sector the ISAC is sharing the information with.  The EU ISACs should focus their efforts on:  • improving their knowledge of applicable legislation related to information  exchange;  • improving their knowledge of technical skills in information analysis and  exchange.  5.2.2.  Organisational steps  ISACs need to have clearly defined roles to be able to exchange information. Currently, such  roles are not clearly defined. In addition, ISACs should introduce SOPs for sharing information  outside their communities. Therefore, ISACs need to identify and assign specific roles to enable  information exchange to the outside community and follow predefined and tested procedures.  The EU ISACs should focus their efforts on:  • developing proper roles and responsibilities for sharing information outside the  ISAC community;  • developing SOPs for cross-sectoral information sharing;  • exchanging good practices in cross-sectoral information exchange.  In the interviews and in ENISA’s experience, trust is of the utmost importance in information  sharing, especially when sharing with the outside community. The organisation of cross-sectoral  exercises and/or training is a natural way of building trust among the communities. In addition,  to build further trust, staff exchange or cross-participation in ISAC events is beneficial.  5.2.3.  Technical steps  There is a need to test the effectiveness of the steps implemented in response to the  recommendations above (this may also include continuous improvement). This could be done  by introducing cross-sectoral exercises on technical and organisational aspects of information  exchange.  Automation is a key component of effectively and efficiently ingesting technical information such  as IoCs. Accordingly, having a common platform or a platform that supports commonly  supported formats is beneficial, especially for sharing operational information, which has a short  lifespan.  The EU ISACs should focus their efforts on:  • SOP testing and live information exchange testing;  • cross-sectoral training using specific technical tools.

This 110  document is intended to help individual organizations within an enterprise improve their ICT risk 111  management (ICTRM). This can enable enterprises and their component organizations to better 112  identify, assess, and manage their ICT risks in the context of their broader mission and business 113  objectives. This document explains the value of rolling up and integrating risks that may be 114  addressed at lower system and organizational levels to the broader enterprise level by focusing 115  on the use of ICT risk registers as input to the enterprise risk profile. 116  Keywords 117  enterprise risk management (ERM); enterprise risk profile (ERP); enterprise risk register (ERR); 118  information and communications technology (ICT); ICT risk; ICT risk management (ICTRM); 119  ICT risk measurement; risk appetite; risk register; risk tolerance. 120  Audience 121  The primary audience for this publication is both Federal Government and non-Federal 122  Government professionals at all levels who understand ICT risk management (ICTRM) for one 123  or more ICT domains, but may be unfamiliar with ERM. The secondary audience includes both 124  federal and non-Federal Government corporate officers, high-level executives, ERM officers and 125  staff members, and others who understand ERM but may be unfamiliar with the unique 126  characteristics of ICTRM. All readers are expected to gain an improved understanding of how 127  ICTRM and ERM relate to each other, as well as the benefits of integrating their use. 128  Trademark Information 129  All registered trademarks and trademarks belong to their respective organizations. 130  Document Conventions 131  For the purposes of this document, “assets” are defined as technologies that may compose an 132  information or communications system. The term “asset” or “assets” is used in multiple 133  NIST SP 800-221 ipd ENTERPRISE IMPACT OF INFORMATION  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  AND COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY RISK  iii  frameworks and documents. Examples include laptop computers, desktop computers, servers, 134  sensors, data, mobile phones, tablets, routers, and switches. In instances where the authors mean 135  “assets” as they might be discussed at the enterprise level, the word “asset” will be preceded by 136  words such as “enterprise,” “high-level,” “balance sheet,” or “Level 1” to differentiate context. 137  This document uses the phrase “information and communications technology” for ICT. As of 138  this writing, both this phrase and the same phrase with “communication” instead of 139  “communications” are widely used. The phrases essentially mean the same thing. 140  This document references two types of controls, each of which is essential and should not be 141  confused with the other: 142  • Internal controls are the overarching mechanisms used to achieve and monitor 143  enterprise objectives. The COSO Internal Control – Integrated Framework defines 144  internal control as “a process effected by an entity’s board of directors, management and 145  other personnel designed to provide reasonable assurance of the achievement of 146  objectives.” [COSOERM] These internal controls are an important factor at the enterprise 147  level. In fact, the title of OMB Circular A-123 is “Management’s Responsibility for 148  Enterprise Risk Management and Internal Control.” 149  • Risk management controls represent the safeguards or countermeasures prescribed for 150  an information system or an organization to protect ICT in line with mission and business 151  objectives. These controls provide the management, administrative, and technical 152  methods for responding to ICT risks by deterring, detecting, preventing, or correcting 153  threats and vulnerabilities. 154  Note to Reviewers 155  The authors are grateful for the feedback and support provided by the community in response to 156  draft publications. In support of the final edition of this report, NIST asks that readers review the 157  following questions and consider these in your feedback and recommendations. 158  1. Is the treatment of discipline-specific risks (cybersecurity, privacy, supply chain, 159  communications, etc.) clearly expressed in context and relationship to categorization of 160  ICT, operational, and enterprise risk? 161  2. Has the consideration/treatment of risk associated with the intricacies and complexities of 162  interconnectivity, as part of the broader enterprise risk portfolio, been appropriately 163  addressed? Would examples/use-cases depicting this notion further, in the form of 164  supplemental material, be useful? 165  3. Are risk appetite and risk tolerance clearly explained and example use demonstrated? 166  4. Should BIA (business impact analysis) be addressed in this document or as a separate 167  Special Publication? 168  5. Does this publication effectively relate to both private and public sector enterprises 169  through its structure, terminologies, and examples? 170  6. Has this publication provided a clear definition and understanding of positive risk? 171  NIST SP 800-221 ipd ENTERPRISE IMPACT OF INFORMATION  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  AND COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY RISK  iv  7. Does the information outlined in this publication provide sufficient information to inform 172  any mandatory/required disclosures (e.g., U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission 173  [SEC], Internal Revenue Service [IRS])? 174  8. Does this publication provide sufficient information to enable the allocation tradeoffs of 175  an organization’s operating expenses (OpEx) and capital expenditures (CapEx) for ICT 176  risk and issues? 177  9. Does this publication provide actionable guidance to identify, measure, and manage the 178  new dimension of risk inherent in ICT “systems-of-systems”? 179  10. Are there additional ICTRM/ERM-related topics that would be helpful to include in 180  future iterations of this publication? 181  Call for Patent Claims 182  This public review includes a call for information on essential patent claims (claims whose use 183  would be required for compliance with the guidance or requirements in this Information 184  Technology Laboratory (ITL) draft publication). Such guidance and/or requirements may be 185  directly stated in this ITL Publication or by reference to another publication. This call also 186  includes disclosure, where known, of the existence of pending U.S. or foreign patent applications 187  relating to this ITL draft publication and of any relevant unexpired U.S. or foreign patents. 188  ITL may require from the patent holder, or a party authorized to make assurances on its behalf, 189  in written or electronic form, either: 190  a) assurance in the form of a general disclaimer to the effect that such party does not hold 191  and does not currently intend holding any essential patent claim(s); or 192  b) assurance that a license to such essential patent claim(s) will be made available to 193  applicants desiring to utilize the license for the purpose of complying with the guidance 194  or requirements in this ITL draft publication either: 195  i. under reasonable terms and conditions that are demonstrably free of any unfair 196  discrimination; or 197  ii. without compensation and under reasonable terms and conditions that are 198  demonstrably free of any unfair discrimination. 199  Such assurance shall indicate that the patent holder (or third-party authorized to make assurances 200  on its behalf) will include in any documents transferring ownership of patents subject to the 201  assurance, provisions sufficient to ensure that the commitments in the assurance are binding on 202  the transferee, and that the transferee will similarly include appropriate provisions in the event of 203  future transfers with the goal of binding each successor-in-interest. 204  The assurance shall also indicate that it is intended to be binding on successors-in-interest 205  regardless of whether such provisions are included in the relevant transfer documents. 206  Such statements should be addressed to: ictrm@nist.gov 207  mailto:ictrm@nist.gov?subject=SP%20800-221%20Patent%20Comments  NIST SP 800-221 ipd ENTERPRISE IMPACT OF INFORMATION  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  AND COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY RISK  v  Executive Summary 208  All types of organizations, from corporations to federal agencies, face a broad array of risks. For 209  federal agencies, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-11 defines risk as 210  “the effect of uncertainty on objectives” [OMB-A11]. The effect of uncertainty on enterprise 211  mission and business objectives may then be considered as an “enterprise risk” that must be 212  similarly managed. An enterprise is an organization that exists at the top level of a hierarchy 213  with unique risk management responsibilities. Managing risks at that level—enterprise risk 214  management (ERM)—calls for understanding the core risks that an enterprise faces, determining 215  how best to address those risks, and ensuring that the necessary actions are taken. In the Federal 216  Government, ERM is considered “an effective agency-wide approach to addressing the full 217  spectrum of the organization’s significant risks by understanding the combined impact of risks as 218  an interrelated portfolio rather than addressing risks only within silos” [OMB-A11]. OMB 219  Circular A-123 “establishes an expectation for federal agencies to proactively consider and 220  address risks through an integrated…view of events, conditions, or scenarios that impact mission 221  achievement” [OMB-A123]. 222  The information and communications technology (ICT) on which an enterprise relies is managed 223  through a broad set of risk disciplines. For more than 50 years, NIST publications have provided 224  important guidance for individual programs such as manufacturing excellence, privacy, supply 225  chain, and cybersecurity. But, as the OMB quotes above point out, enterprise risk considerations 226  and decisions must take a portfolio perspective. Individual risk programs have an important role 227  and must integrate activities as part of that enterprise portfolio. Doing so ensures a focus on 228  achieving enterprise objectives and helps identify those risks that will have the most significant 229  impact on the entity’s mission. This publication extends that NIST risk program guidance, 230  recognizing that risk extends beyond the boundaries of individual programs. ICT risk 231  considerations and disciplines (e.g., Internet of Things, supply chain, privacy, cybersecurity) as 232  well as risk management frameworks (e.g., those for artificial intelligence and for information 233  systems and organizations) support the management of a mosaic of interrelated risks. Effectively 234  addressing these ICT risks at the enterprise level requires coordination, communication, and 235  collaboration. This publication examines the relationships among ICT risk disciplines and 236  enterprise risk practices. 237  The broad set of ICT disciplines forms an adaptive system-of-systems composed of many 238  interdependent components and channels. The resulting data represents information, control 239  signals, and sensor readings. As with other complex systems-of-systems, the interconnectedness 240  of these technologies produces system behaviors that cannot be determined by the behavior of 241  individual components. That interconnectedness causes risks which exist between risk programs 242  and across multiple risk programs. As our systems become more complex, they present 243  exploitable vulnerabilities, emergent risks, and system instabilities that, once triggered, can have 244  a runaway effect with multiple severe, often irreversible consequences. In the contemporary 245  enterprise, emergency and real-time circumstances can turn a relatively minor ICT-based risk 246  into true operational risks that disrupt an organization’s ability to perform mission or business 247  functions.  248  This publication supports an interconnected approach to risk frameworks and programs that 249  addresses ICT risk as a special subset of enterprise risk. This publication encourages the practice 250  NIST SP 800-221 ipd ENTERPRISE IMPACT OF INFORMATION  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  AND COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY RISK  vi  of aggregating and normalizing ICT risk information, helping to identify, quantify, and 251  communicate risk scenarios and their consequences. Doing so supports effective decision-252  making. That integrated approach ensures that shareholder and stakeholder value is quantified in 253  financial, mission, and reputation metrics similar to those attributed to other (non-technical) 254  enterprise risks, enabling executives and officials to prudently reallocate resources among all the 255  varied competing risk types. 256  While NIST is widely recognized as a source of cybersecurity guidance, cyber is only one 257  portion of a large and complex set of uncertainties including financial, legal, legislative, safety, 258  and strategic risks. As part of an ERM program, senior leaders (e.g., corporate officers, 259  government senior executive staff) often have fiduciary and reporting responsibilities that other 260  organizational stakeholders do not, so 261  they have a unique responsibility to 262  holistically manage the combined set of 263  risks. ERM provides the umbrella under 264  which risks are aggregated and 265  prioritized so that all risks can be 266  evaluated and “stovepiped” risk 267  reporting can be avoided. ERM also 268  provides an opportunity for 269  identification of operational risk, a 270  subset of the enterprise risks so 271  significant that potential losses could 272  jeopardize one or more aspects of 273  operations. Risk managers will 274  determine whether a failed internal 275  process (related to enterprise people, 276  processes, technology, or governance) 277  will directly cause a significant 278  operational impact. Some risk response 279  activities are there to directly protect 280  mission operations. Enterprise leaders 281  should define these operational risk 282  parameters as part of enterprise risk 283  strategy. 284  This publication explores the high-level 285  ICT risk management (ICTRM) process 286  illustrated by Figure 1. Many resources 287  – such as well-known frameworks from 288  the Committee of Sponsoring 289  Organizations (COSO), OMB circulars, 290  and the International Organization for 291  Standardization (ISO) – document 292  ERM frameworks and processes. They 293  generally include similar approaches: 294  identify context, identify risks, analyze 295  Figure 1: ICTRM Integration Cycle  NIST SP 800-221 ipd ENTERPRISE IMPACT OF INFORMATION  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  AND COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY RISK  vii  risk, estimate risk importance, determine and execute the risk response, and identify and respond 296  to changes over time. The process recognizes that no risk response should occur without 297  understanding stakeholder expectations for managing risk to an acceptable level, as informed by 298  leadership’s risk appetite and risk tolerance statements. 299  To ensure that leaders can be provided a composite understanding of the various threats and 300  consequences facing each organization and enterprise, risk information is recorded and shared 301  through risk registers.1 At higher levels in the enterprise structure, various risk registers 302  (including those related to ICTRM) are aggregated, normalized, and prioritized into risk profiles. 303  While it is critical that enterprises address potential negative impacts on mission and business 304  objectives, it is equally critical (and required for federal agencies) that enterprises plan for 305  success. OMB states that “the [Enterprise Risk] profile must identify sources of uncertainty, both 306  positive (opportunities) and negative (threats).” [OMB-A123] Enterprise-level decision makers 307  use the risk profile to choose which enterprise risks to address, allocate resources, and delegate 308  responsibilities to appropriate risk owners. ERM strategy includes defining terminology, formats, 309  criteria, and other guidance for risk inputs from lower levels of the enterprise. 310  Integrated risk management information from throughout the enterprise helps create a composite 311  enterprise risk register (ERR) and a prioritized enterprise risk profile (ERP) to inform company 312  executives and agency officials’ ERM deliberations, decisions, and actions. It describes the 313  inclusion of ICT risks (including various operational technology, supply chain, privacy, and 314  cybersecurity risks) as part of financial, valuation, mission, and reputation exposure. A 315  comprehensive ERR and ERP support communication and disclosure requirements. The 316  integration of technology-specific risk management activities supports an understanding of 317  exposures related to corporate reporting (e.g., income statements, balance sheets, cash flow) and 318  similar requirements (e.g., reporting for appropriation and oversight authorities) for public-sector 319  entities. The iterative ICTRM process enables adjustments to risk direction. As leaders receive 320  feedback regarding enterprise progress, strategy can be adjusted to take advantage of an 321  opportunity or to better address negative risk as information is collected and shared. 322  Application of a consistent approach to identify, assess, respond to, and communicate risk 323  throughout the enterprise about the entire portfolio of ICT risk disciplines will help ensure that 324  leaders and executives are always informed and able to support effective strategic and tactical 325  decisions. While the methods for managing risk among different disciplines will vary widely, an 326  ICT-wide approach to directing that risk management, reporting and monitoring the results, and 327  adjusting to optimize achievement of enterprise objectives will provide valuable benefits.  328  1  OMB Circular A-11 defines a risk register as “a repository of risk information including the data understood about risks  over time” [OMB-A11].

COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY RISK  1  1 Introduction 421  The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) defines risk as “the effect of uncertainty on 422  objectives” [OMB-A11]. The effect of uncertainty on enterprise mission and business objectives 423  may then be considered an enterprise risk that must be similarly managed. The process of 424  managing risks at the enterprise level is known as enterprise risk management (ERM), and it 425  calls for: 426  • identifying and understanding the core risks facing an enterprise, 427  • determining how best to address those risks, and 428  • ensuring that the necessary actions are taken. 429  Playbook: Enterprise Risk Management for the U.S. Federal Government [ERMPLAYBOOK] 430  defines numerous types of risk, including compliance, financial, information and 431  communications technology (ICT), legal, legislative, operational, reputational, and strategic.2 432  Enterprises use ERM to holistically manage the combined set of risks. OMB Circular A-123 433  “establishes an expectation for federal agencies to proactively consider and address risks through 434  an integrated…view of events, conditions, or scenarios that impact mission achievement” 435  [OMB-A123]. OMB considers ERM to be “an effective agency-wide approach to addressing the 436  full spectrum of the organization’s significant risks by understanding the combined impact of 437  risks as an interrelated portfolio, rather than addressing risks only within silos.” [OMB-A123] In 438  the private sector, the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations (COSO) publication, Enterprise 439  Risk Management – Integrating with Strategy and Performance, defines ERM as the “culture, 440  capabilities, and practices that organizations integrate with strategy-setting and apply when they 441  carry out that strategy, with a purpose of managing risk in creating, preserving, and realizing 442  value.” [COSOERM] 443  Many ICT risk management (ICTRM) disciplines, including cybersecurity, supply chain, and 444  privacy, have evolved into full-fledged risk programs because of organizations’ reliance on ICT. 445  The rapid evolution of ICTRM disciplines sometimes has led to miscommunication and 446  inefficiencies between those risk programs and the overarching ERM portfolio of risks. In recent 447  years, NIST has published guidance to codify risk management practices for several individual 448  ICT risk programs, such as general cybersecurity (Cybersecurity Framework), general privacy 449  (Privacy Framework), information system and organization cybersecurity and privacy (Risk 450  Management Framework), artificial intelligence (AI Risk Management Framework), Internet of 451  Things (IoT) cybersecurity, and cyber supply chain risk management.  452  1.1 Purpose and Scope 453  This publication broadens NIST’s existing ICT risk guidance by recognizing and incorporating 454  ICTRM within the overall sphere of ERM. All ICT risk programs can work together to support 455  ERM and can be integrated into risk portfolios for ERM. Comparing the outputs of ICTRM 456  2  While an updated ERM Playbook has been drafted, that publication has not been publicly distributed. Special Publication  (SP) 800-221 draws from the original (2016) edition of that guide but remains consistent with the updated edition.  NIST SP 800-221 ipd ENTERPRISE IMPACT OF INFORMATION  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  AND COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY RISK  2  activities with effective inputs to ERM activities, and the outputs of ERM with effective inputs 457  for ICTRM, enables stakeholders to identify opportunities to close gaps. 458  This document is intended to help improve communication (including risk information sharing) 459  between and among ICT professionals and system owners, high-level executives, and corporate 460  officers at multiple levels. The goal is to assist personnel in better identifying, assessing, and 461  managing ICT risks in the context of their broader mission and business objectives. This 462  document will help professionals understand what executives and corporate officers need for 463  them to carry out ERM. This includes what data to collect, what analyses to perform, and how to 464  consolidate and condition this discipline-specific risk information. This document will also help 465  executives and officers to understand the challenges that ICT professionals face. 466  This document references some materials that are specifically intended for use by federal 467  agencies, but the concepts and approaches are intended to be useful for all enterprises. 468  Other NIST resources supporting this document include the following: 469  • NIST Special Publication (SP) 800-221A, Information and Communications Technology 470  (ICT) Risk Outcomes: Integrating ICT Risk Management Programs with the Enterprise 471  Risk Portfolio [SP800221A] provides a framework of outcomes that applies to all types 472  of ICT risk.

Although they are often used 504  interchangeably,5 for the purposes of this document an organization is an entity of any size, 505  complexity, or position within a larger organizational structure (e.g., a federal agency or 506  company), and an enterprise is an organization at the top level of the hierarchy. Figure 2 shows a 507  notional enterprise with subordinate organizations, illustrating that one of those subordinates is 508  itself an enterprise. Both government and industry are represented in this depiction.  509  Consider the example of 510  the Department of 511  Commerce as a higher-512  level enterprise with 513  bureaus (e.g., Census 514  Bureau, National Oceanic 515  and Atmospheric 516  Administration [NOAA], 517  NIST) as lower-level 518  enterprises and their 519  subordinates (e.g., 520  NOAA’s National 521  Weather Service, NIST 522  laboratories) representing 523  organizations. In 524  industry, consider mergers and 525  acquisitions where an enterprise acquires another company, which itself was an enterprise, and 526  then subordinates it within the higher-level enterprise’s conglomeration of organizations and 527  systems. Each enterprise is supported by various systems, each a discrete set of information 528  resources organized expressly for the collection, processing, maintenance, use, sharing, 529  dissemination, or disposition of information. 530  Most ICTRM responsibilities tend to be carried out by the individual organizations within an 531  enterprise. In contrast, the ERM responsibility for tracking key enterprise risks and their impacts 532  on objectives is at the highest-level enterprise, held by top-level corporate officers and board 533  members who have fiduciary and reporting duties not performed elsewhere in the enterprise. 534  ERM requires identifying and understanding the various types of risk, including ICT risks, that 535  an enterprise faces; determining the probability that these risks will occur; and estimating their 536  5  For example, NIST IR 8170 uses enterprise risk management and organization-wide risk management interchangeably. The  scope of NIST IR 8170 includes smaller enterprises than this publication does, so an enterprise as defined there may be  comprised of a single organization. The enterprises discussed in this publication have more complex compositions. [IR8170]  Figure 2: Enterprise Hierarchy  NIST SP 800-221 ipd ENTERPRISE IMPACT OF INFORMATION  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  AND COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY RISK  5  potential impact. ERM processes provide senior enterprise executives with a portfolio view of 537  key risks across the enterprise, and this portfolio considers the outputs of all ICTRM disciplines.6  538  Public and private enterprises have a common primary purpose for ERM: to safeguard the 539  enterprise’s mission, finances (e.g., net revenue, capital, free cash flow), and reputation (e.g., 540  stakeholder trust) in the face of natural, accidental, and adversarial threats.  541  2.2 ICTRM Life Cycle 542  There are many models for risk management processes. Table 1 illustrates similarities among 543  several common risk management models, including establishing context, identifying risks, 544  analyzing risks, estimating risk importance, determining and executing risk response, and 545  monitoring and responding to changes over time. The entries in Table 1 indicate (in parentheses) 546  their identifier or section number from the source material whenever available. Table 1 provides 547  a high-level comparison and is not intended as a crosswalk for relationships among the models, 548  but instead to show that risk management disciplines that aggregate into the ERM process follow 549  similar steps to manage risk. 550  The resources in Table 1 are from the ERM Playbook [ERMPLAYBOOK], the COSO ERM 551  Framework [COSOERM], International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 31000 552  [ISO31000], OMB Circular A-123 [OMB-A123], and the U.S. Government Accountability 553  Office (GAO) Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government [GREENBOOK]. 554  Table 1: Similarities Among Selected ERM and Risk Management Documents 555  ERM Playbook COSO ERM Framework ISO 31000:2018 OMB A-123 GAO Green Book  Identify the Context  • Governance and  Culture  • Strategy and  Objective Setting  Establish External Context  (5.3.2), Establish Internal  Context (5.3.3)  Establish Context  Define objectives  and risk tolerances  (6.01)  Identify the Risks  • Performance  • Review and Revision  • Information,  Communication and  Reporting  Risk  Assessment  Risk  Identification  (5.4.2)  Identify Risks Identification of  Risks (7.02)  Analyze the Risks  Risk  Analysis  (5.4.3)  Analyze and  Evaluate  Analysis of Risks  (7.05)  Assess Likelihood  Calculate  Level of  Risk  Management  estimates the  significance of a risk  and considers the  magnitude of impact,  the likelihood of  occurrence, and the  nature of the risk  Assess Impact  Prioritize Risks  Calculate Exposure  Plan and Execute  Response Strategies  Risk  Evaluation  (5.4.4)  Develop  Alternatives Response to Risks  (7.08)  Risk Treatment (5.5) Respond to Risks  6  This is defined by OMB as “insight into all areas of organizational exposure to risk […] thus increasing an Agency’s  chances of experiencing fewer unanticipated outcomes and executing a better assessment of risk associated with changes in  the environment” [OMB-A123].  NIST SP 800-221 ipd ENTERPRISE IMPACT OF INFORMATION  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  AND COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY RISK  6  ERM Playbook COSO ERM Framework ISO 31000:2018 OMB A-123 GAO Green Book  Monitor, Evaluate,  and Adjust  • Performance  • Review and Revision  • Information,  Communication and  Reporting  Monitoring and Review (5.6) Monitor  and Review  Identification of  Change (9.02)  Analysis of and  Response to  Change (9.04)  This document uses the processes of the ERM Playbook (column 1 in Table 1) as a basis for 556  describing the ICTRM life cycle and explaining, at a high level, how ICTRM integrates with 557  ERM. This is not meant to imply that all enterprises should use these particular steps; enterprises 558  should determine and apply the appropriate approach to achieve ICTRM/ERM integration, 559  communication, and monitoring. The six steps in the notional ICTRM life cycle are: 560  • Step 1. Identify the context. Context is the external and internal environment in which 561  the enterprise operates and is influenced by the risks involved. This step includes 562  determining and documenting the enterprise mission, including goals and objectives, and 563  the enterprise risk management strategy. This step also includes enterprise leaders 564  communicating risk management expectations to their component organizations. 565  • Step 2. Identify the risks. This means identifying the comprehensive set of positive and 566  negative risks and determining which events could enhance or impede objectives, 567  including the risk of failing to pursue an opportunity.  568  • Step 3. Analyze the risks. This involves estimating the likelihood that each identified 569  risk event will occur and the potential impact of the consequences described. 570  • Step 4. Prioritize the risks. The exposure is calculated for each risk based on likelihood 571  and potential impact, and the risks are then prioritized based on their exposure. 572  • Step 5. Plan and execute risk response strategies. The appropriate response is 573  determined for each risk and informed by risk guidance from leadership. 574  • Step 6. Monitor, evaluate, and adjust risk management. Continual monitoring ensures 575  that enterprise risk conditions remain within the defined risk appetite levels as risks 576  change.  577  Steps 2 through 6 usually utilize risk registers. OMB Circular A-11 describes a risk register as “a 578  repository of risk information, including the data understood about risks over time.” It also 579  states, “Typically, a risk register contains a description of the risk, the impact if the risk should 580  occur, the probability of its occurrence, mitigation strategies, risk owners, and a ranking to 581  identify higher priority risks.” [OMB-A11] Each register evolves and matures as other risk 582  activities take place. 583  Not all risk management methodologies generate an artifact called a risk register or risk log. 584  However, the output of each methodology contains the underpinnings of (or can serve as an input 585  to) a risk register. Because they can be useful information-gathering constructs, organizations not 586  yet familiar with or using risk registers are strongly urged to adopt and integrate them into 587  whatever risk management methodology they are currently using. Risk registers represent an 588  organizing principle for communicating ICT risks to the OMB Circular A-123 ERM process for 589  NIST SP 800-221 ipd ENTERPRISE IMPACT OF INFORMATION  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  AND COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY RISK  7  organizations already familiar with this 590  management construct. Documenting 591  and tracking ICT risks in risk registers 592  provides a common organizing method 593  and fosters communication from ICT 594  risk disciplines to senior decision 595  makers.  596  Figure 3 depicts a notional ICTRM life 597  cycle with numbers to indicate where 598  each step occurs. Section 3 provides 599  more detail about each step and all the 600  elements within Figure 3. 601  2.3 ICTRM and ERM Integration 602  ERM and ICTRM have several points of 603  integration. First, enterprise governance 604  activities for ERM direct the strategy 605  and methods for ICTRM and other risk 606  management disciplines to use. Based 607  on this guidance, each discipline within 608  each organization uses risk registers to 609  document its risks – in the case of 610  ICTRM, risks derived from system-level 611  assessments. Next, these risk registers 612  are aggregated and normalized, then 613  used to create enterprise-level risk 614  registers for each discipline. These, in 615  turn, become part of a broader 616  enterprise risk register (ERR) that 617  encompasses all disciplines.  618  Figure 4 demonstrates that ERM and ICTRM are not separate processes; ICTRM represents an 619  important subset of the broader portfolio of ERM. Documenting and tracking ICT risks in lower-620  level risk registers supports better management of ICT risks at the enterprise level.  621  The ERR is prioritized by those with fiduciary and oversight responsibilities, creating an 622  enterprise risk profile (ERP), also known as an ERM risk profile.7 An ERP is created by 623  considering enterprise risks in relation to achieving objectives as typically outlined in an 624  organizational strategic plan. OMB Circular A-123 [OMB-A123] requires ERPs to include four 625  kinds of objectives: strategic, operations (operational effectiveness and efficiency), reporting 626  (reporting reliability), and compliance (compliance with applicable laws and regulations). While 627  there may be some overlap among the categories of objectives, understanding uncertainty as it 628  7  OMB Circular A-123 recommends (and requires for federal users) recording enterprise risks in an enterprise risk profile.  Figure 3: Notional Life Cycle for Integrated ICTRM/ERM  NIST SP 800-221 ipd ENTERPRISE IMPACT OF INFORMATION  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  AND COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY RISK  8  affects these objectives will help inform effective and timely decision-making. Effective ERM 629  balances achieving objectives with optimizing resources. 630  Section 3 discusses ICTRM 631  and ERM integration in 632  much greater detail. 633  2.4 Shortcomings of 634  Typical Approaches 635  to ICTRM 636  Historically, in many 637  enterprises, ICTRM 638  disciplines have not been 639  well integrated with ERM 640  processes. While ICTRM 641  follows many of the same 642  high-level principles as the 643  ERM framework, ICTRM 644  is typically executed quite 645  differently, and its outputs 646  are not always properly 647  conditioned as ERM inputs. 648  Some common contributors 649  to those shortcomings are 650  described below. 651  2.4.1 Increasing System 652  and Ecosystem 653  Complexity 654  Many systems today are 655  complex, adaptive “system-656  of-systems” composed of 657  thousands of 658  interdependent components 659  and myriad channels. The 660  systems operate in a rapidly 661  changing socio-political-662  technological environment 663  that presents threats from individuals and groups with shifting alliances, attitudes, and agendas. 664  The constant introduction of new technologies has changed and complicated cyberspace. 665  Wireless connections, big data, cloud computing, and the IoT present new complexities and 666  concomitant vulnerabilities. Information and technology are no longer like simple, automated 667  filing systems. Rather, they are like the central nervous system – a delicately balanced and 668  intricate part of an organization or enterprise that coordinates and controls the most fundamental 669  assets of most organizations. This ecosystem’s increasing complexity gives rise to systemic risks 670  Figure 4: ICTRM As Part of ERM  NIST SP 800-221 ipd ENTERPRISE IMPACT OF INFORMATION  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  AND COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY RISK  9  and exploitable vulnerabilities that, once triggered, can have a runaway effect with multiple 671  severe consequences for enterprises.  672  Managing ICT risk for these ecosystems is incredibly challenging because of their dynamic 673  complexity. This complexity increases risk to specific systems, and that risk can cascade to 674  create additional risks at the system, organization, and enterprise levels. Emerging risk 675  conditions created by the interdependence of systems and counterparty risk must also be 676  identified, tracked, and managed. 677  2.4.2 Lack of Standardized Measures 678  ICT risk measurement has been extensively researched for decades. As measurement techniques 679  have evolved, the complexity of digital assets has also greatly increased, making the 680  measurement problem more difficult to solve. Some low-level measures8 have been 681  standardized, like the estimated likelihood and impact of a particular vulnerability being 682  exploited. However, for many aspects of ICT risk, there are no standard measures. Without 683  consistent measures, there is little basis for analyzing risk or expressing risk in comparable ways 684  across digital assets and the systems composed of those assets. 685  2.4.3 Informal Analysis Methods 686  Risk analysis for ICT tends to be inconsistent compared to many other forms of risk. Even where 687  guidance is provided, such as in NIST publications, the resulting risk assessment reports from 688  agencies differ significantly. Moreover, foundational inputs for likelihood and impact 689  calculations generally lack a standardized methodology or are at the discretion of vendors who 690  provide a scoring system. Decisions are often made based on an individual’s instinct, experience, 691  and knowledge of conventional wisdom and typical practices. In addition, there is usually little 692  analysis performed after controls are deployed to determine whether risks have been reduced to a 693  level deemed acceptable (i.e., within the established risk tolerance parameters). 694  2.4.4 Overly Focused on the System Level 695  The management of ICT risk is conducted in different ways at various levels, including at the 696  system, organization, and enterprise levels. A common practice is for individual system-level 697  teams to be responsible for tracking relevant risks. While system reporting to the organizational 698  level may occur, there is typically no mechanism in place to consolidate the risk data for systems 699  to the organization level, much less to the enterprise level. When organization or enterprise 700  managers receive system risk data, it is often a vague risk map or at such a volume as to be 701  impractical. Therefore, it is not surprising that higher levels of an organization or enterprise tend 702  to struggle with understanding ICT risk. This struggle may be less pronounced in organizations 703  with an enterprise architecture that maps systems onto the business processes they support. 704  Many enterprise risks are interdependent. A common industry example is that while 705  cybersecurity, privacy, and credit risks are different elements of the ERM portfolio, it is quite 706  8  NIST typically uses the term “measures” instead of “metrics.” For more information on the distinction, see  https://www.nist.gov/itl/ssd/software-quality-group/metrics-and-measures.  https://www.nist.gov/itl/ssd/software-quality-group/metrics-and-measures  NIST SP 800-221 ipd ENTERPRISE IMPACT OF INFORMATION  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  AND COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY RISK  10  possible that a cybersecurity breach of personally identifiable information might result in a credit 707  downgrade or a loss of public confidence. These interdependencies make it important that 708  enterprise managers collaborate, communicate, and recognize that information, technology, and 709  business risks are not isolated issues. 710  2.4.5 The Gap Between ICTRM Output and ERM Input 711  An enterprise that seeks to avoid all ICT risk might stifle innovation or efficiencies to the point 712  where little value would be produced. At the other end of the spectrum, an enterprise that applies 713  technology without regard to actual risk increases the chances that it might fall victim to 714  undesirable consequences. Effectively balancing the benefits of technology with the potential 715  risks and consequences of a threat event is more likely to result in effective ICTRM that supports 716  a comprehensive ERM approach. Enterprises, organizations, and practitioners should consider 717  the influence of risks on achieving enterprise strategic, operations, reporting, and compliance 718  objectives. Enterprise risk officers should clearly communicate these enterprise objectives so that 719  practitioners can take actions and provide relevant risk inputs to ERM programs. They also need 720  to consider relevant policy decisions and regulatory impacts. 721  For ERM purposes, there should be a process for integrating the risk registers of various ICTRM 722  disciplines. This allows for the easy exchange of risk knowledge between ICTRM and ERM 723  participants. Many organizations do not conduct these activities in consistent, repeatable ways. 724  Quantifying and aggregating ICT risks are often done in an ad hoc fashion and are not performed 725  with the rigor used for other types of risk. This lowers the quality of ICT risk information 726  provided to ERM. 727  2.4.6 Losing the Context of the Positive Risk 728  As aggravated by the multi-level nature of risk management, sometimes risks identified and 729  managed at the system and organizational levels lose the context of associated positive risks.  730  The basic rationalization for addressing negative risks with resources, time, and funding is that 731  positive risks warrant those investments. Only by evaluating the value of positive risks alongside 732  the expense of negative risks can we understand whether continued pursuit of positive risks and 733  investment in negative risks is “worth it.” Losing track of positive risks can result in over-734  investing in the corresponding negative risks. 735  NIST SP 800-221 ipd ENTERPRISE IMPACT OF INFORMATION  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  AND COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY RISK  11  3 ICT Risk Considerations  736  This section discusses ICT risk considerations, with the content structured according to the six 737  steps in the notional ICTRM life cycle described in Figure 3: 738  1. Identify the context.  739  2. Identify the risks.  740  3. Analyze (quantify) the risks.  741  4. Prioritize the risks.  742  5. Plan and execute risk response strategies.  743  6. Monitor, evaluate, and adjust risk management. 744  Following those, Section 3.7 briefly discusses considerations for positive risks.  745  3.1 Identify the Context 746  In the risk management life cycle, the first step in managing ICT risks is understanding context –747  the environment in which the organization operates and is influenced by the risks involved. The 748  context provides important input into the other risk management life cycle steps by documenting 749  the expectations and drivers to be considered. The risk context includes two factors: 750  • External context involves the expectations of outside stakeholders who affect and are 751  affected by the organization, such as customers, regulators, legislators, and business 752  partners. These stakeholders have objectives, perceptions, and expectations about how 753  risk will be communicated, managed, and monitored. 754  • Internal context relates to many of the factors within the organization and relevant 755  considerations across the enterprise. This includes any internal factors that influence risk 756  management, such as the organization and enterprise’s objectives, governance, culture, 757  risk appetite, risk tolerance, policies, and practices. 758  Several NIST frameworks begin with determining these context factors. NIST Cybersecurity 759  Framework Step 1: Prioritize and Scope states that organizations make strategic decisions 760  regarding ICT implementations and determine the scope of the systems and assets that support 761  the selected business line or process. These context exercises identify the organization mission 762  drivers and priorities used for subsequent assessment and planning. 763  3.1.1 Risk Governance  764  As an important component of ERM, ICTRM helps assure that ICT risks do not hinder 765  accomplishment of established enterprise mission objectives. ICTRM also helps ensure that 766  exposure from ICT risk remains within the limits assigned by enterprise leadership. The method 767  for connecting enterprise operations and communications to strategy is governance. Governance 768  represents the methods for evaluating strategic options and directing activities to achieve that 769  strategy. Through a governance model, enterprise objectives are determined, providing direction 770  for prioritization and decision-making. Governance is often described as distinct from 771  management in the same way that a directive from a ship’s captain is distinct from the many 772  NIST SP 800-221 ipd ENTERPRISE IMPACT OF INFORMATION  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  AND COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY RISK  12  activities performed to fulfill the directive. Similarly, risk governance is the process by which 773  risk management evaluation, decisions, and actions are connected to enterprise strategy and 774  objectives. 775  Risk governance provides the transparency, responsibility, and accountability that enables 776  managers to acceptably manage risk. In this regard, there can be multiple participants in the 777  governance process, depending on context and enterprise type. Larger entities might implement 778  risk governance mechanisms across the enterprise with more specific governance mechanisms at 779  the organization (e.g., division, portfolio, or bureau) and apply that strategy to systems or 780  programs. 781  Table 2 illustrates some notional roles and responsibilities at each level. 782  Table 2: Examples of Risk Oversight Roles and Responsibilities 783  Risk  Functions  Notional  Private-Sector  Roles  Notional Federal  Government Roles  Notional  Responsibilities  Enterprise- Level  Oversight  Board of  Directors,  Regulators, Chief  Executive  Officer, Chief  Operating Officer  OMB, U.S.  Congressional  Oversight  Committees, Head of  Agency  Ensures alignment with strategic priorities;  monitors and corrects misalignments; holds  management accountable for performance;  receives periodic progress reports.

Determines enterprise risk threshold (risk appetite  and tolerance) for high-priority risks in consultation  with business leads and ensures that it is  communicated and known by the appropriate staff.  9  In the U.S. Federal Government, the Chief Financial Officer may be given purview over ERM functions due to the  partnership of those functions with internal controls per OMB Circular A-123. In some agencies, the Chief Operating  Officer leads these functions to achieve an integrated view of all types of risk.

As shown in the table, certain enterprise and organization risk governance functions may be 784  delegated to other senior leaders. Individual risk programs – including cybersecurity, privacy, 785  and cyber supply chain risk management (C-SCRM) – might then further translate enterprise risk 786  direction (e.g., risk appetite statements) into program-specific risk direction, enabling holistic 787  risk processes while supporting system owners’ decision authority. The division of responsibility 788  is typical in larger organizations where an officer is specifically assigned to be responsible for 789  program governance (e.g., chief information security officer, chief privacy officer). 790  3.1.2 Risk Appetite and Risk Tolerance 791  This document draws on ERM principles regarding integration with culture, strategy, and 792  performance. One such principle is that an “organization must manage risk to strategy and 793  business objectives in relation to its risk appetite – that is, the types and amount of risk, on a 794  broad level, it is willing to accept in its pursuit of value.” [COSOERM] OMB adapted this 795  language for government use in Circular A-123 by similarly stating that risk appetite “is the 796  broad-based amount of risk an organization is willing to accept in pursuit of its mission/vision” 797  [OMB-A123]. Risk appetite is defined by the enterprise’s senior-level leadership as part of risk 798  governance. Risk appetite serves as the guidepost for the types and amount of risk, on a broad 799  level, that senior leaders are willing to accept in pursuit of mission objectives and enterprise 800  value.10 Risk appetite may be qualitative or quantitative.  801  Another important ERM concept is risk tolerance – the organization’s or stakeholders’ readiness 802  to bear the remaining risk after responding to or considering the risk in order to achieve its 803  objectives (while recognizing that such tolerance can be influenced by legal or regulatory 804  10  OMB Circular A-123 defines risk appetite as “the broad-based amount of risk an organization is willing to accept in pursuit  of its mission/vision. It is established by the organization’s most senior level leadership and serves as the guidepost to set  strategy and select objectives.”  NIST SP 800-221 ipd ENTERPRISE IMPACT OF INFORMATION  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  AND COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY RISK  14  requirements). In Circular A-123, OMB again adapted the COSO language [COSOERM] by 805  stating that risk tolerance “is the acceptable level of variance in performance relative to the 806  achievement of objectives.” Risk tolerance can be defined at the enterprise level, but OMB 807  Circular A-123 offers a bit of discretion to organizations, stating that risk tolerance is “generally 808  established at the program, objective, or component level,” which this publication references as 809  the “organization level.” 810  While risk appetite is defined at the enterprise level and risk tolerance at the enterprise or 811  organization level, risk appetite is interpreted at the organizational and system levels to develop 812  specific ICT risk tolerance. Risk tolerance represents the specific level of performance risk 813  deemed acceptable within the risk appetite set by senior leadership (while recognizing that such 814  tolerance can be influenced by legal or regulatory requirements).11 Risk tolerance is interpreted 815  and applied by the receiving custodians of the risk management discipline (e.g., cybersecurity, 816  financial, legal, privacy) at the organization or system level.  817  Risk appetite and risk tolerance are related but distinct in a similar manner to the relationship 818  between governance and management activities. Risk appetite statements define the overarching 819  risk guidance, and risk tolerance statements define the specific application of that direction. This 820  means that risk tolerance statements are always more specific than the corresponding risk 821  appetite statements. Together, risk appetite and risk tolerance statements represent risk limits, 822  help communicate risk expectations, and improve the focus of risk management efforts. They 823  also help to address other factors, such as findings from internal audits or external reports. The 824  definition of these risk parameters places the enterprise in a better position to identify, prioritize, 825  treat, and monitor risks that may lead to unacceptable loss. Risk tolerance should always stay 826  within the boundaries established by senior leadership, within the parameters of and informed by 827  legal and regulatory requirements. 828  An example of a statement of risk appetite is: “Email service shall be available during the large 829  majority of a 24-hour period.” An associated risk tolerance statement for this appetite would be 830  narrower: “Email services shall not be interrupted more than five minutes during core hours.” 831  Table 3 provides additional examples of actionable, measurable risk tolerance, illustrating the 832  application of risk appetite to specific contexts within the organization-level structure. Several 833  NIST documents, including the NIST IR 8286 series and Cyber Supply Chain Risk Management 834  Practices for Systems and Organizations, NIST SP 800-161, Revision 1, also provide detailed 835  examples of risk appetite and risk tolerance statements and how they are interpreted and applied 836  with the associated risk defined, managed, and communicated back to executive management via 837  the risk register [SP800161]. 838  11  OMB Circular A-123 states, “Risk must be analyzed in relation to achievement of the strategic objectives established in the  Agency strategic plan (see OMB Circular No. A-11, Section 230), as well as risk in relation to appropriate operational  objectives. Specific objectives must be identified and documented to facilitate identification of risks to strategic, operations,  reporting, and compliance” [OMB-A123].  NIST SP 800-221 ipd ENTERPRISE IMPACT OF INFORMATION  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  AND COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY RISK  15  Table 3: Examples of Risk Appetite and Risk Tolerance 839  Example  Enterprise Type Example Risk Appetite Statement Example Risk Tolerance Statement  Global Retail Firm Our customers associate reliability with  our company’s performance, so service  disruptions must be minimized for any  customer-facing websites.  Regional managers may permit website  outages lasting up to four hours for no more  than five percent of its customers.  Government  Agency  Mission-critical systems must be protected  from known ICT vulnerabilities.  Critical software vulnerabilities (severity score  of 10) must be patched on systems designated  as mission-critical within 14 days of discovery.  Internet Service  Provider  The company has a low risk appetite with  regard to failure to meet customer service  level agreements, including network  availability and communication speeds.  Patches must be applied to avoid attack-related  outages but must also be well-tested and  deployed in a manner that does not reduce  availability below agreed-upon service levels.  Academic  Institution  The institution understands that mobile  computers are a necessary part of the  daily life of students, and some loss is  expected. The leadership, however, has  no appetite for the loss of any sensitive  data (as defined by the Data Classification  Policy).  Because the cost of loss prevention for  students’ laptops is likely to exceed the cost of  the devices, it is acceptable for up to 10 percent  to be misplaced or stolen if and only if sensitive  institution information is prohibited from being  stored on students’ devices.  Healthcare  Provider  The Board of Directors has decided that  the enterprise has a low risk appetite for  any exposures caused by inadequate  access control or authentication  processes.  There will always be some devices that do not  yet support advanced authentication, but  100 percent of critical healthcare business  applications must use multi-factor  authentication.  3.1.3 Risk Management Strategy 840  As part of their governance responsibilities, senior enterprise executives should establish clear 841  and actionable risk management guidance based on enterprise mission and business objectives to 842  the organizations within their purview. This should include an enterprise strategy regarding 843  mission priority, risk appetite and tolerance (typically in the form of risk appetite and risk 844  tolerance statements), and capital and operating budgets to manage risks to an acceptable level. 845  Organizations then manage and monitor processes that properly balance risks and resource 846  allocation with the value created by ICT. Measurements (e.g., from key risk indicators, or KRIs) 847  demonstrate where risk tolerances have been exceeded or validate that the enterprise is operating 848  within the defined appetite.  849  As the risk landscape evolves (e.g., due to technological or environmental changes), enterprise 850  leaders should continually review and adjust the risk strategy. For example, an enterprise subject 851  to outside regulation is likely to receive specific guidance regarding updated federal statutes and 852  directives that must be considered when evaluating acceptable risk. 853  Differing assumptions may occur at all levels of the organization, so it is important to determine 854  internal and external stakeholders’ expectations regarding risk communications and to use 855  readily understandable and agreed-upon terms and categories, such as strategic objectives, 856  organizational priorities, decision-making processes, and risk reporting or tracking 857  methodologies (e.g., regular risk management committee discussions and meetings). It is also 858  critical that enterprise leaders provide guidance regarding risk calculations. Establishing a 859  NIST SP 800-221 ipd ENTERPRISE IMPACT OF INFORMATION  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  AND COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY RISK  16  common scale for assessing levels of risk will support consistent risk estimation, measurement, 860  and reporting. The strategy may also include guidance regarding the mechanisms and frequency 861  of risk reporting. 862  As risks are recorded, tracked, and reassessed throughout the cycle, this foundation ensures that 863  all agree about how various types of risk will be communicated and managed to ensure 864  adherence to risk guidance and expectations. 865  Risk management strategy is similar for both public- and private-sector enterprises. For example, 866  public officials and corporate boards typically measure and weigh the impact and likelihood of 867  each type of significant risk (e.g., market, operational, labor, geopolitical, technology, data) to 868  determine their individual and total impacts on the enterprise’s mission, finances, and reputation. 869  The public officials or board members then determine their risk appetite and resource allocations 870  for each type of risk commensurate with likelihood and impact and balanced among all 871  calculated enterprise risk exposures (the product of likelihood and impact). Public officials and 872  board members also provide guidance to their corporate officers at the enterprise level and to 873  high-level executives at the organization level. This includes guidance on ceilings for capital 874  expenditures (CapEx) and operating expenses (OpEx) and objectives for free cash flow. For the 875  Federal Government, similar requirements are expressed through OMB guidance and strategic 876  direction from senior agency officials, chief executives, and other designees (e.g., an ERM 877  Council).  878  For both private- and public-sector entities, leaders issue guidance to continue, accelerate, 879  reduce, delay, or cancel significant enterprise initiatives. They do this while making decisions 880  about what constitutes prudent risk disclosures, balancing the competing objectives of a) 881  properly informing stakeholders and overseers (including regulators) through required filings and 882  statements at hearings, versus b) protecting sensitive information from competitors and 883  adversaries. 884  3.2 Identify the Risks 885  The second step in the risk management life cycle involves identifying a comprehensive set of 886  risks and recording them in the risk register. This involves identifying those events that could 887  enhance or impede objectives, including the risks involved in failing to pursue opportunities. ICT 888  risk identification is composed of four inputs: 889  1. identification of the organization’s mission-supporting assets and their valuation, 890  2. determination of potential threats that might jeopardize the security or performance of 891  those assets and potential ICT opportunities that might benefit the organization, 892  3. consideration of the vulnerabilities of those assets, and 893  4. evaluation of the potential consequences of risk scenarios. 894  Sections 3.2.1 through 3.2.4 discuss each of these four inputs in more detail. 895  Risk practitioners often perform risk identification as both top-down and bottom-up exercises. 896  For example, after the organization has considered critical or mission-essential functions, it may 897  consider various types of issues that could jeopardize those functions as an input to risk scenario 898  NIST SP 800-221 ipd ENTERPRISE IMPACT OF INFORMATION  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  AND COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY RISK  17  development. Subsequently, as a detailed threat and vulnerability assessment occurs, assessors 899  consider how those threats might affect various assets by conducting a bottom-up assessment. 900  This bidirectional approach helps support holistic and comprehensive risk identification. 901  3.2.1 Inventory and Valuation of Assets 902  Since ICT risk reflects, at least in part, the effect of uncertainty on digital components that 903  support enterprise objectives, practitioners identify the assets that are necessary to achieve those 904  objectives. The value of an asset extends beyond its replacement cost. For example, an 905  organization could calculate the direct cost of research and development for a new product 906  offering, but the long-term losses associated with the theft of that intellectual property could 907  impact future revenue, share prices, enterprise reputation, and competitive advantage. A core 908  concept in ERM is prioritizing attention and resources on those assets that have the greatest 909  impact on an enterprise’s ability to achieve its mission (and, in the case of federal agencies, 910  impact that affects the public.) 911  Risk managers should leverage a business impact analysis (BIA) template that can be used to 912  consistently evaluate, record, and monitor the criticality and sensitivity of enterprise assets.12 It is 913  vitally important to gain senior stakeholders’ guidance regarding the determination of which 914  assets are critical or sensitive. Federal agencies are required to identify and record high value 915  assets, or HVAs. The relative importance of each enterprise asset is a necessary input for 916  considering the impact portion of risk analysis.  917  Note that many of the assets on which an organization depends are not within its direct control. 918  External technical assets may include cloud-based software or platform services, 919  telecommunications circuits, and video monitoring. Personnel may include the internal 920  workforce, external service providers, and third-party partners. 921  3.2.2 Determination of Potential Threats 922  ICT risk is not inherently good or bad. Rather, it represents the effects of uncertain 923  circumstances, so risk managers should consider a broad array of potential positive and negative 924  risks. The following sections primarily deal with negative risks. A threat represents any 925  circumstance or event with the potential to adversely impact organizational operations (a 926  negative risk)13. The threat could arise from a malicious person with harmful intent or from an 927  unintended or unavoidable situation (e.g., a natural disaster, technical failure, or human errors) 928  that may trigger a vulnerability. Numerous threat modeling techniques are available for 929  analyzing specific threats. It may be helpful to consider both a top-down approach (i.e., 930  reviewing critical or sensitive assets for what could potentially go wrong, regardless of threat 931  source) and a bottom-up approach (i.e., considering the potential impact of a given set of threat 932  or vulnerability scenarios). 933  12  For more information on BIA, see NIST IR 8286D [IR8286D].  13  The term threat is used throughout this publication to describe the source of any problem, circumstance, or event with the  potential to adversely impact organizational operations. The word threat may have specific meaning, and possibly greater or  lesser importance, within a given risk program.  NIST SP 800-221 ipd ENTERPRISE IMPACT OF INFORMATION  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  AND COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY RISK  18  One source of threat information is a high-level assessment based on various frameworks (e.g., 934  NIST Cybersecurity Framework, Privacy Framework, Secure Software Development 935  Framework). These frameworks often provide a way to determine the enterprise’s currently 936  implemented practices (i.e., current state) and ways to review the risk implications of that state to 937  identify potential risk scenarios. 938  One commonly used method that may help organizations identify potential risk outcomes is a 939  SWOT (strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, threats) analysis. Applying SWOT analysis helps 940  users identify opportunities that arise from organizational strengths (e.g., a well-respected 941  software development team) and threats (e.g., supply chain issues) that reflect an organizational 942  weakness. The use of SWOT analysis helps describe and consider the context described in 943  Section 3.1, including internal factors (strengths and weaknesses internal to the organization), 944  external factors (the opportunities and threats presented by the external environment), and ways 945  in which these factors relate to each other. 946  While it is critical that enterprises address potential negative impacts on mission and business 947  objectives, it is equally critical (and required for federal agencies) that enterprises plan for 948  success. OMB states in Circular A-123 that “the profile must identify sources of uncertainty, 949  both positive (opportunities) and negative (threats).” However, the notion of “planning for 950  success” by identifying and realizing positive risks (opportunities) is a relatively new concept in 951  ICTRM that is influencing other risk management disciplines. For the moment, it should be 952  noted that both positive and negative risks follow the same processes, from identification to 953  analysis to inclusion in the ERP. 954  Whatever means are used to determine potential threats, it is important to consider them in terms 955  of both the threat actors (i.e., the sources of risks with the capability to result in harmful impact) 956  and the threat events caused by their actions. 957  Combinations of multiple risks should also be considered. For example, if one risk in the register 958  refers to a website outage and another risk refers to an outage of the customer help desk, there 959  may need to be a third risk in the register that considers the likelihood and impact of an outage 960  affecting both services at once. It is also important to identify cascading risks where one primary 961  risk event may trigger a secondary and even a tertiary event. Analysis of the likelihood and 962  impact of these first-, second-, and third-order risks is described in Section 3.3. 963  During the threat modeling process, it is important for the practitioner to look out for and 964  mitigate instances of cognitive bias. Some common issues of bias include: 965  • Overconfidence – The tendency for stakeholders to be overly optimistic about risk 966  scenarios (e.g., unreasonably low likelihood of a threat event, overstated benefits of an 967  opportunity, exaggerated estimation of the ability to handle a threat) 968  • Group think – Rendering decisions as a group about potential threat sources and threat 969  events in a way that discourages creativity or individual responsibility 970  • Following trends – Blindly following the latest hype or craze without a detailed analysis 971  of the specific threats facing the organization 972  NIST SP 800-221 ipd ENTERPRISE IMPACT OF INFORMATION  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  AND COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY RISK  19  • Availability bias – The tendency to focus on issues (such as threats) that come readily to 973  mind because one has heard or read about them, perhaps in ways that are not 974  representative of the actual likelihood of a threat event occurring and resulting in adverse 975  impact 976  3.2.3 Determination of Exploitable and Susceptible Conditions 977  The next key input to risk identification is understanding the potential conditions that enable a 978  threat event to occur. It is important to consider all types of vulnerabilities in all assets, including 979  people, facilities, and information. For the purposes of this document, vulnerability is simply a 980  condition that enables a threat event to occur. It could be an unpatched software flaw, a raw 981  material limitation, a process that leads to human error, or a physical environmental condition 982  (like a wooden structure being flammable). The presence of a vulnerability does not cause harm 983  in and of itself, as there needs to be a threat present to exploit it. Moreover, a threat that does not 984  have a corresponding vulnerability may not result in a negative risk. Identifying negative risks 985  includes understanding the potential threats and vulnerabilities to organizational assets, which 986  can then be used to develop scenarios that describe potential risks. 987  Some weaknesses, such as software flaws or misconfigurations, can be identified using 988  automated scanners. These automated techniques may help to quickly identify some common 989  vulnerabilities, but ICT weaknesses are not limited to enterprise hardware and software. For the 990  ICT risk disciplines of privacy, supply chain, and cybersecurity, reviewing the controls described 991  in NIST SP 800-53, Security and Privacy Controls for Information Systems and Organizations, 992  may help highlight many potential weaknesses. [SP80053] 993  3.2.4 Evaluation of Potential Consequences 994  The final component of risk identification is documenting the potential consequences of each 995  risk listed in the register. Many organizations incorrectly express risks outside of their context. 996  For example, a stakeholder might say, “I’m worried about floods,” or “I’m concerned about a 997  denial-of-service attack.” These examples cannot be analyzed or considered without knowing the 998  full picture. Considering the above factors, an effective example of an identified risk might be 999  (as expressed in cause-and-effect terminology), “If a hurricane causes a storm surge, it could 1000  flood the data center and damage multiple critical file servers.” 1001  Notably, ICT risks that cause unexpected or unreliable behavior in a system do not always result 1002  in the complete failure of that system to fulfill its duty in support of business objectives. Many 1003  elements of a risk management plan are implemented to support redundancy and resilience so 1004  that a highly likely threat event might result in manageable consequences. Resilient enterprise 1005  systems may be able to continue operating in the face of adverse circumstances. 1006  3.2.5 Risk Register Use 1007  Risk registers are used within organizations to communicate and track ICT risks over time. By 1008  combining the results of Sections 3.2.1 through 3.2.4, the practitioner can create a set of risk 1009  scenarios in the Risk Description column of the risk register. Risk scenarios provide a means to 1010  present detailed risk information in context. A complete risk scenario describes the source of 1011  uncertainty, predisposing conditions, resources affected, and anticipated result. For ICT risks, a 1012  NIST SP 800-221 ipd ENTERPRISE IMPACT OF INFORMATION  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  AND COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY RISK  20  scenario might include a threat source, a threat event, a vulnerability that threat source might 1013  exploit, enterprise assets impacted by the threat, and the resulting harmful impact. For example, 1014  “Construction activity severs a critical fiber optic cable that was not protected in conduit, 1015  interrupting communications to the data center and resulting in the loss of availability of 1016  enterprise financial systems.” Scenarios may also help to describe positive risk (i.e., 1017  opportunity). An example of this might be, “Construction of a new alternate data center improves 1018  the resilience of financial infrastructure and reduces the likelihood of an interruption.” 1019  Figure 5 shows a notional risk register template. The notional template includes many of the 1020  elements suggested by OMB Circular A-11. It illustrates only the current risk assessment (i.e., 1021  likelihood, impact, and resulting exposure value). Organizations will need to determine which 1022  assessments should be reflected in the risk register. Because this document describes the risk 1023  register as an input into ERM processes, only the current risk assessment results are depicted. 1024  Some organizations may wish to include both the current risk assessment (before risk response is 1025  applied) and the anticipated changes to risk that are expected to result based on the risk response. 1026  1027  Figure 5: Notional Risk Register Template 1028  Table 4 describes each of the elements in the notional risk register template. The actual 1029  composition of the register will vary among enterprises and may contain more or fewer data 1030  points than those described in Table 4. For example: 1031  • If the register is to be updated after the risk response, the results of a post-response 1032  assessment could be reflected in the register as the residual risk.  1033  • Organizations might document a desired risk state based on risk appetite/tolerance, the 1034  target residual risk.  1035  Table 4: Descriptions of Notional Risk Register Template Elements 1036  Register Element Description  ID (Risk Identifier) A sequential numeric identifier for referring to a risk in the risk register.  Priority A relative indicator of the criticality of this risk, either expressed in ordinal value (e.g., 1,  2, 3) or in reference to a given scale (e.g., high, moderate, low).  Risk Description A brief explanation of the risk scenario (potentially) impacting the organization and  enterprise. Risk descriptions are often written in a cause-and-effect format, such as “if X  occurs, then Y happens.”  NIST SP 800-221 ipd ENTERPRISE IMPACT OF INFORMATION  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  AND COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY RISK  21  Register Element Description  Risk Category An organizing construct that enables multiple risk register entries to be consolidated.  Consistent risk categorization is helpful for comparing risk registers during the risk  aggregation step of ERM.  Current Assessment –  Likelihood  An estimation of the probability that this scenario will occur before any risk response. On  the first iteration of the risk cycle, this may also be considered the initial assessment.  Current Assessment – Impact  Analysis of the potential benefits or consequences that might result from this scenario if  no additional response is provided. On the first iteration of the risk cycle, this may also  be considered the initial assessment.  Current Assessment –  Exposure Rating  A calculation of the probability of risk exposure based on the likelihood estimate and the  determined benefits or consequences of the risk. Throughout this report, the  combination of impact and likelihood is referred to as exposure. Other common  frameworks use different terms for this combination, such as level of risk (e.g., ISO  31000). On the first iteration of the risk cycle, this may also be considered the initial  assessment.  Risk Response Type The risk response (sometimes referred to as the risk treatment) for handling the  identified risk. Values for risk response types are listed in Table 5 of this document.  Risk Response Cost The estimated cost of applying the risk response.  Risk Response  Description  A brief description of the risk response. For example, “Implement software management  application XYZ to ensure that software platforms and applications are inventoried,” or  “Develop and implement a process to ensure the timely receipt of threat intelligence from  [name of specific information sharing forums and sources].”  Risk Owner The designated party responsible and accountable for ensuring that the risk is  maintained in accordance with enterprise requirements. The risk owner may work with a  designated risk manager who is responsible for managing and monitoring the selected  risk response.  Status A field for tracking the current condition of the risk and any next activities.  Regardless of which model is selected for use as a risk register, it is important for the enterprise 1037  to ensure that the model is used in a consistent and iterative way. As the risk professional 1038  progresses through the steps in Section 3, the risk register will be populated with relevant 1039  information. Once decisions have been made as part of a subsequent review of the risks, the 1040  agreed-upon risk response becomes the current state after mitigations are put in place, and the 1041  cycle begins anew. 1042  Using risk registers for ICT uncertainty provides consistency in capturing, organizing, and 1043  communicating risk-related information throughout the ICTRM and ERM processes. The risk 1044  registers used at each level convey information about risk assessments, evaluation decisions, 1045  responses, and monitoring activities. The remainder of this section provides guidance and useful 1046  information for completing and using registers and integrating them with ERM. 1047  While the risk register itself can be used to document and communicate information about 1048  current risks and responses, it may be necessary to supplement the register with a risk detail 1049  record (RDR). A notional example of an RDR is provided in Appendix B. The use of RDRs 1050  enables the documentation of details regarding the considerations, assumptions, and results of 1051  risk management activity. It also enables the enterprise to record personnel involved in those 1052  considerations, any actions to be taken, and schedules. Contents of an RDR may include: 1053  ● Information regarding the risk itself, such as a detailed risk scenario description and 1054  underlying threats, vulnerabilities, assets threatened, risk category, and risk assessment 1055  results 1056  NIST SP 800-221 ipd ENTERPRISE IMPACT OF INFORMATION  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  AND COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY RISK  22  ● Roles involved in risk decisions and management (e.g., risk owner, risk manager, action 1057  owner for specific activities, stakeholders involved in risk response decisions, contractual 1058  agreements for supply chain/external partners) 1059  ● Schedule considerations, such as the date the risk was first documented, the date of the 1060  last risk assessment, completion dates for mitigations, and the date of the next expected 1061  assessment 1062  ● Risk response decisions and follow-up, including detailed plans, status, and risk 1063  indicators 1064  An RDR may be stored and maintained in a written record, as part of an organizational 1065  knowledge management system, or as a database entry in risk-specific software, such as a 1066  Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC) application.  1067  3.3 Analyze (Quantify) the Risks 1068  In Step 3 of the risk management life cycle, each ICT risk is analyzed to estimate the likelihood 1069  that the risk event will occur, and the potential impact of the consequences is described. 1070  3.3.1 Risk Analysis Types 1071  Relying solely on an informal risk analysis may impair effective ICTRM decision support. A 1072  broad array of risk analysis methodologies is available to aid in making a more accurate 1073  estimation, such as International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) 31010:2019 [IEC31010] 1074  and the Open Group’s Open Factor Analysis of Information Risk (FAIR) standards 1075  [OPENFAIR]. Risk analysis methods include: 1076  • Qualitative analysis, based on the assignment of a descriptor, such as low, medium, or 1077  high. The scale can be formed or adjusted to suit the circumstances, and different 1078  descriptions may be used for different risks. Qualitative analysis is helpful as an initial 1079  assessment or when intangible aspects of risk are to be considered. To improve the 1080  accuracy of qualitative analysis, values and data can be leveraged from external sources, 1081  such as industry benchmarks or standards, metrics from similar previous risk scenarios, 1082  or findings from inspections and assessments. 1083  • Quantitative analysis involves numerical values, which are assigned to both impact and 1084  likelihood. These values are based on statistical probabilities and a monetized valuation 1085  of loss or gain. The quality of the analysis depends on the accuracy of the assigned values 1086  and the validity of the statistical models used. Consequences may be expressed in terms 1087  of financial, technical, or human impacts. 1088  Some practitioners apply a semi-quantitative assessment that uses a numerical scale that 1089  represents some range of values or meanings in the enterprise context. The application of this 1090  model helps translate risk analysis into qualitative terms that support risk communications for 1091  decision makers while also supporting relative comparisons (such as within a particular scale or 1092  range). 1093  Each of these analysis types has advantages and disadvantages, so the type performed should be 1094  consistent with the context associated with the risk. The methods to be selected and under what 1095  NIST SP 800-221 ipd ENTERPRISE IMPACT OF INFORMATION  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  AND COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY RISK  23  circumstances depend on many organizational factors and might be included in the risk 1096  management discussions described in Section 3.1. While qualitative methods are commonplace, 1097  the practitioner may benefit from considering a quantitative methodology with a more scientific 1098  approach to estimating the likelihood and the impact of consequences where the data is available 1099  for this type of analysis. This may help to better prioritize risks or prepare more accurate risk 1100  exposure forecasts. The benefits of such an approach may be offset by the fact that changing the 1101  risk assessment methodology may require time and resources for development and training. 1102  Common ERM practices include both qualitative and quantitative types of risk analysis. When 1103  selecting the most appropriate type of risk analysis at the system or organization level, 1104  practitioners should consider both consistency with ERM at the enterprise level and the accuracy 1105  of measuring ICT risks. 1106  3.3.2 Techniques for Estimating Likelihood and Impact 1107  Since one of the primary goals of ICTRM is to identify potential risks that are most likely to 1108  have a significant impact, an accurate reflection of risk details is critical. Fortunately, risk 1109  management has been practiced for many years, and there are many effective techniques for 1110  analyzing risk in comparison with enterprise risk appetite and system or organizational risk 1111  tolerance. IEC 31010 [IEC31010] is an international standard that describes and provides 1112  guidance on 17 risk assessment techniques that can be used for analyzing controls, dependencies, 1113  and interactions; understanding consequence and likelihood; and measuring overall risk. In 1114  addition to analysis techniques like those described below, understanding the likelihood of threat 1115  events and their potential impacts will also draw on experimentation, investigations into previous 1116  risk events, and research into the risk experiences of similar organizations. 1117  The likelihood and impact elements of a risk can be broken into sub-factors. For example, 1118  consider a risk scenario in which a critical business server becomes unavailable to an 1119  organization’s financial department. The age of the server, the network on which it resides, and 1120  the reliability of its software all influence the likelihood of a failure. The impact of this scenario 1121  can also be considered through various factors. If another server is highly available through a 1122  fault-tolerant connection, the loss of the initial server may have little consequence. Other factors 1123  also impact risk analysis, such as timing. If the financial server supports an important payroll 1124  function, the impact of a loss occurring shortly before payday may be significantly higher than if 1125  it were to occur after paychecks are distributed. The impact may vary greatly depending on 1126  whether the server is used for archiving legacy records or performing urgent stock trades. There 1127  are many considerations that go into estimating exposures and the events that can trigger them. 1128  Whichever sub-factors an organization chooses to consider, they should be clearly delineated and 1129  defined to ensure consistency in their use for likelihood and frequency estimation as well as 1130  overall risk register assessment and aggregation. 1131  The calculation of multiple or cascading impacts is an important consideration, and each 1132  permutation should be individually included in the risk register. Secondary loss events should be 1133  captured with primary loss events to represent the total impact and cost of a risk scenario. The 1134  omission of secondary losses in the assessment of a risk scenario would underestimate the total 1135  impact, thereby misinforming risk response selection and prioritization. For example, while the 1136  organization might consider a risk that a telecommunications outage would result in the loss of 1137  NIST SP 800-221 ipd ENTERPRISE IMPACT OF INFORMATION  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  AND COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY RISK  24  availability of a critical web server, there may also be secondary loss events, including the loss of 1138  customers from frustration with unavailable services or penalties resulting from the failure to 1139  meet contractual service levels. An analysis of cascading risks should include the consideration 1140  of factors that would lead to a secondary risk, such as the outage described above. 1141  Examples of techniques for estimating the probability that a risk event will occur include: 1142  • Bayesian analysis – A model that helps inform a statistical understanding of probability 1143  as more evidence or information becomes available 1144  • Monte-Carlo – A simulation model that draws upon random sample values from a given 1145  set of inputs, performs calculations to determine results, and iteratively repeats the 1146  process to build up a distribution of the results 1147  • Event tree analysis – A modeling technique that represents a set of potential events that 1148  could arise following an initiating event from which quantifiable probabilities could be 1149  considered graphically 1150  Both tangible (e.g., direct financial losses) and less tangible impacts (e.g., reputational damage 1151  and impairment of mission) should be considered when evaluating the potential consequences of 1152  risk events. These are connected since direct losses will affect reputation, and reputational risk 1153  events will nearly always result in risk response expenses. OMB Circular A-123 states that 1154  “reputational risk damages the reputation of an agency or component of an agency to the point of 1155  having a detrimental effect capable of affecting the agency’s ability to carry out mission 1156  objectives.” There is a broad range of stakeholders to be considered when estimating reputational 1157  risk, including the workforce, partners, suppliers, regulators, legislators, public constituents, and 1158  clients/customers. 1159  Practitioners document and track the potential consequences of each ICT risk that would 1160  significantly impact enterprise objectives, such as causing material reputation damage or 1161  significant financial losses to the enterprise. Documenting and tracking these consequences at the 1162  organization or system level streamlines the step of providing ICT risk inputs to the ERM 1163  program. 1164  The estimation of the likelihood and impact of a risk event should account for existing and 1165  planned controls. The ERM Playbook provides the following guidance: 1166  Identifying existing controls is an important step in the risk analysis process. Internal 1167  controls (such as separation of duties or conducting robust testing before introducing new 1168  software) can reduce the likelihood of a risk materializing and the impact. […] One way 1169  to estimate the effect of a control is to consider how it reduces the threat likelihood and 1170  how effective it is against exploiting vulnerabilities and the impact of threats. Execution 1171  is key – the presence of internal controls does not mean they are necessarily effective. 1172  [ERMPLAYBOOK] 1173  The estimated likelihood and impact of each risk are recorded in the appropriate columns within 1174  the risk register. After risk responses are determined, the analysis should be revised to reflect the 1175  mitigation (of likelihood and impact) from each risk response. The residual risk (i.e., the 1176  remaining risk after applying risk responses) should then be recorded in the risk register’s 1177  NIST SP 800-221 ipd ENTERPRISE IMPACT OF INFORMATION  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  AND COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY RISK  25  Residual Risk column. To simplify the process of normalizing risk registers when developing an 1178  ERR, a consistent time frame should be used for estimating the likelihood of each risk. Likewise, 1179  the level of impact helps to normalize the risk during the aggregation and prioritization process. 1180  3.4 Prioritize Risks 1181  After identifying and analyzing applicable risks and recording them in risk registers, the 1182  priorities of those risks should be determined and indicated. This is accomplished by determining 1183  the exposure presented by each risk (i.e., based on the likelihood that a threat event will occur 1184  and result in an adverse impact). 1185  An ICT risk can have adverse effects on achieving organizational objectives. Based on the 1186  analysis conducted using the processes described in Section 3.3, such effects could range from 1187  negligible to severe, so exposure determination is important. Additionally, since organizations 1188  have limited resources, it is helpful to sort the risks within the register in order of importance to 1189  prioritize risk response. As shown in the template in Figure 5, this result helps complete the 1190  Priority column.14 1191  When completing the Priority column of the risk register, consider the following: 1192  • How to combine the calculations of likelihood and impact to determine exposure15 1193  • How to determine and measure the potential benefits of pursuing a particular risk 1194  response 1195  • When to seek additional guidance on how to evaluate risk exposure levels, such as while 1196  evaluating exposures germane to risk tolerance statements 1197  Practitioners use both qualitative and quantitative models for calculating and communicating 1198  about exposure. Figure 6 demonstrates the use of qualitative descriptors for likelihood and 1199  impact as well as how these might be used to determine an overall exposure value.16 Each risk is 1200  evaluated in light of the risk’s likelihood and impact as determined during risk analysis. The 1201  thresholds for ranges of exposure can be established and published as part of the enterprise 1202  governance model and used by stakeholders to prioritize each risk in the register. 1203  14  While risks in the register are assigned a priority to help rank their relative importance, this prioritization is distinct from  (but may help inform) the enterprise-level prioritization performed by senior leaders to create the enterprise risk profile.  15  The formula for calculating risk exposure is the total loss if the risk occurs multiplied by the probability that the risk will  happen. Loss is calculated through a traditional BIA used in conjunction with the risk register model to inform the senior- level decision-making process.  16  Individual risk programs may have varying views on how to calculate and record likelihood in program risk registers. Most  risk programs view likelihood as a factor of threat and vulnerability. Risk programs are encouraged to use the risk  adjudication and communication process as an opportunity to discuss and standardize any program-specific likelihood  calculation.  NIST SP 800-221 ipd ENTERPRISE IMPACT OF INFORMATION  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  AND COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY RISK  26  1204  Figure 6: Example of a Qualitative Risk Matrix 1205  Figure 7 depicts a quantitative example. In this illustration, the enterprise has provided guidance 1206  that any risk above 0.20 (based on likelihood times impact) represents a high risk, and risks rated 1207  between 0.06 and 0.20 are designated as moderate. 1208  1209  Figure 7: Example of a Quantitative Risk Matrix 1210  While prioritization will be strongly influenced by the risk exposure determination, other factors 1211  such as enterprise context or stakeholder priorities may also influence those decisions. 1212  Stakeholders might also define a minimum level of exposure to include on the risk register 1213  through the risk management strategy or other directives. While ICT risks should not arbitrarily 1214  be omitted from the register, there are likely to be many that represent such a low exposure that 1215  they need not be included. Guidance for this threshold should be applied consistently throughout 1216  the enterprise. 1217  For those ICT risks that are included and prioritized in the risk register, an evaluation should be 1218  performed to identify an appropriate risk response, as described in the next topic. 1219  3.5 Plan and Execute Risk Response Strategies 1220  The fifth step of the risk management life cycle is to determine the appropriate response to each 1221  risk. The goal of effective risk management, including ICT risks, is to identify ways to keep risk 1222  aligned with the risk appetite or tolerance in as cost-effective a way as possible. In this stage, the 1223  practitioner will determine whether the exposure associated with each risk in the register is 1224  NIST SP 800-221 ipd ENTERPRISE IMPACT OF INFORMATION  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  AND COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY RISK  27  within acceptable levels based on the potential consequences. If not, that practitioner can identify 1225  and select cost-effective risk response options to achieve ICT objectives. 1226  Planning and executing risk responses is an iterative activity and should be based on the risk 1227  strategy guidance described in Section 3.1.3. As the risk oversight authorities monitor the 1228  success of those responses, they will provide operational leaders with financial and mission 1229  guidance to inform future risk management activities. In some cases, risk evaluation may lead to 1230  a decision to undertake further analysis to confirm estimates or more closely monitor results (as 1231  described in Section 4.2). Note that risk responses themselves may introduce new risks. For 1232  example, adding multi-factor authentication to a business system to reduce an access control risk 1233  may introduce a new risk of decreased productivity when users have difficulty authenticating. 1234  While there is some variance among the terms used by risk management frameworks, there are 1235  four types of actions available (as described in Table 5) for responding to negative ICT risks: 1236  accept, transfer, mitigate, and avoid. 1237  Table 5: Response Types for Negative ICT Risks 1238  Type Description  Accept Accept ICT risk within risk tolerance levels. No additional risk response action is needed except for  monitoring.  Transfer For ICT risks that fall outside of tolerance levels, reduce them to an acceptable level by sharing a  portion of the consequences with another party (e.g., ICT insurance). While some of the financial  consequences may be transferable, there are often consequences that cannot be transferred, like a  loss of customer trust.  Mitigate Apply actions (e.g., risk management controls) that reduce a given risk to an acceptable level.  Responses could include those that help prevent a loss (i.e., reducing the probability of occurrence or  the likelihood that a threat event materializes or succeeds) or that help limit such a loss by decreasing  the amount of damage and liability.  Avoid Apply responses to ensure that the risk (specifically the threat) does not occur. Avoiding a risk may be  the best option if there is not a cost-effective method for reducing the ICT risk to an acceptable level.  The cost of the lost opportunity associated with such a decision should be considered as well.  In many cases, mitigation to bring exposure to negative ICT risks within risk tolerance levels is 1239  accomplished using risk management controls. For example, if the risk executive function 1240  declares that the organization must avoid risks with likelihood and impact values of high/high for 1241  all costs over $500,000, the Risk Response Type column of the risk register (see Figure 5) can be 1242  updated with a response type from Table 5. While including a particular informative reference 1243  (e.g., security controls or Cybersecurity Framework and/or Privacy Framework categories and 1244  subcategories) may be helpful in guiding and describing risk response, additional information is 1245  likely to be required. 1246  In general, people, processes, and technology combine to provide risk management controls that 1247  can be applied to achieve an acceptable level of risk. Examples of controls include: 1248  • Preventative: Reduce or eliminate specific instances of a weakness 1249  • Deterrent: Reduce the likelihood of a threat event by dissuading a threat actor 1250  • Detective: Provide warning of a successful or attempted threat event 1251  • Corrective: Reduce exposure by offsetting the impact of consequences after a risk event 1252  NIST SP 800-221 ipd ENTERPRISE IMPACT OF INFORMATION  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  AND COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY RISK  28  • Compensating: Apply one or more controls to adjust for a weakness in another control 1253  Consider an organization that identifies several high-exposure negative risks, including that poor 1254  authentication practices (e.g., weak or reused passwords) could enable the disclosure of sensitive 1255  customer financial information and that employees of the software provider might gain 1256  unauthorized access to and tamper with the financial data. The organization can apply several 1257  deterrent controls (documenting the applied control identifiers and any applicable notes in the 1258  Risk Register Comments column), including warning banners and the threat of prosecution for 1259  any threat actors that intentionally attempt to gain unauthorized access. Preventative controls 1260  include applying strong identity management policies and using multi-factor authentication 1261  tokens that help reduce authentication vulnerabilities. The software provider has installed 1262  detective controls that monitor access logs and alert the organization’s security operations center 1263  if internal staff connect to the customer database without a need for access. Furthermore, the 1264  financial database is encrypted so that it protects its data if the file system is exfiltrated. 1265  Risk response will often involve creating a risk reserve to avoid or mitigate an identified 1266  negative risk or to realize or enhance an identified positive risk. A risk reserve is similar to other 1267  types of management reserves in that funding or labor hours are set aside and employed if a risk 1268  is triggered to ensure that the opportunity is realized or the threat is avoided. For example, the 1269  technical skills needed to recover after an ICT attack may not be available with current staffing 1270  resources. A risk reserve can also be used with the accept response type to address this (e.g., by 1271  setting aside funds during project planning to employ a qualified third party to augment the 1272  internal incident response and recovery effort.) 1273  3.6 Monitor, Evaluate, and Adjust Risk Management 1274  Risk management should not be simply managing lists of risks. For the activities to be 1275  meaningful, risk managers throughout the enterprise must be informed about objectives, results, 1276  priorities, and opportunities. A key purpose of 1277  the various risk registers is to enable ongoing 1278  monitoring of enterprise risk activities. Based 1279  on those activities, senior leaders evaluate 1280  available options and adjust guidance and 1281  operations to help realize opportunities and 1282  minimize harmful impacts. This Monitor-1283  Evaluate-Adjust (MEA) cycle is depicted in 1284  Figure 8. This iterative approach begins with 1285  an understanding of what risk limits are 1286  acceptable, given enterprise context and 1287  strategic objectives. The purpose of ICTRM 1288  integration is to enable senior leaders to remain 1289  aware of ongoing risk management activities 1290  and apply corrective measures in order to 1291  achieve strategic objectives.  1292  As risk response activities occur, they are recorded 1293  in ICT risk registers. The results are monitored, 1294  Figure 8: Monitor-Evaluate-Adjust Cycle  NIST SP 800-221 ipd ENTERPRISE IMPACT OF INFORMATION  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  AND COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY RISK  29  and performance measurements are collected through KPIs and KRIs and compared with risk 1295  strategy and risk direction (based on risk appetite and risk tolerance statements). Leaders provide 1296  direction regarding an overall appetite for risk, which is then interpreted at a more granular level 1297  as risk tolerance statements. Those risk directives are achieved through the application of various 1298  controls that modify the risk conditions. The metrics are reported to managers and leaders, 1299  enabling oversight and management of the achievement of the risk tolerance. 1300  Previous discussions highlighted risk direction based on risk appetite statements and their 1301  interpretation as risk tolerance statements. There is a third component of risk direction that must 1302  be observed – that of risk capacity, defined as the maximum amount of risk that an organization 1303  is able to endure. While the enterprise should always take steps not to exceed risk appetite, the 1304  consequences of doing so are rarely catastrophic. Exceeding risk capacity, on the other hand, 1305  could have dire consequences and may even jeopardize the continuance of the enterprise. 1306  Catastrophic results are not limited to the private sector. Many government entities have 1307  experienced severe consequences because their risk management processes permitted those 1308  enterprises to approach or exceed risk capacity. Such cases can end the career of senior leaders 1309  whose risk monitoring should have identified the risk conditions. 1310  It is noteworthy that, like risk appetite and tolerance, risk capacity can extend throughout the 1311  hierarchical enterprise layers. For example, if a business unit or government bureau exceeded its 1312  risk capacity, that portion of the enterprise could be severely impeded or closed. ISACA states 1313  that exceeding risk capacity could result in the enterprise’s continued existence being questioned 1314  [ISACA]. ISO 31010:2019 describes a similar example: “For a commercial firm, capacity might 1315  be specified in terms of maximum retention capacity covered by assets, or the largest financial 1316  loss the company could bear without having to declare bankruptcy.” [IEC31010] While 1317  exceeding risk capacity might not immediately result in enterprise extinction, it is clearly a 1318  criterion that must be monitored closely. Because capacity reflects the aggregate risk, it is an 1319  important consideration for those aggregating ICTRM and evaluating the overall risk posture. 1320  3.6.1 When a Risk Event Passes Without Triggering the Event 1321  Risk responses will often be adjusted as opportunities and threats evolve. The concept is similar 1322  to the topic sometimes called the “Cone of Uncertainty” within project management practices; 1323  over time, additional understanding about an identified risk will come to light. For changes in 1324  identified risk, one mitigation technique is the use of risk reserves, as introduced in Section 3.5. 1325  For this risk response, it is important that the risk owners collaborate with the acquisition or 1326  procurement teams and budget owners. With appropriate budget planning, risk reserves can be 1327  released for other predetermined funding requirements after the risk has been reduced to an 1328  acceptable level or the time has passed for the risk to occur. 1329  While many industry-based enterprises can return unused funds to shareholders or pay down 1330  corporate debt, unused reserves are more difficult for government agencies to use without pre-1331  planning. Most government procurement cycles are rigidly based on the government fiscal year. 1332  Identified opportunities can be “planned for” in government procurement cycles as “optional” 1333  tasking or purchases. For example, unused funds could be used to expand a vendor assessment 1334  program to ensure that all supply chain providers (including both immediate service providers 1335  and their downstream providers) fulfill data processing and privacy risk management 1336  NIST SP 800-221 ipd ENTERPRISE IMPACT OF INFORMATION  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  AND COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY RISK  30  requirements. If the current fiscal year only allows for the purchase of half of the required 1337  materials, an option can be included at the time of the base contract award for the other half of 1338  the materials (but not funded at the time of the base contract award). When the practitioner 1339  liberates the risk reserve after the chance of the negative risk occurring has passed, the funding 1340  can be used to exercise the already awarded option that lacked the initial funding when the base 1341  contract was awarded. Exercising an option in government contracting is trivial (often 30 days or 1342  less) when compared to the long lead time for initial contract procurements. 1343  3.7 Considerations of Positive Risks as an Input to ERM 1344  Planning for success is equally as important as avoiding disasters. As mentioned in Section 3.2.2, 1345  OMB states in Circular A-123 that, regarding the inclusion of opportunities (positive risks) as a 1346  function of the ERM profile, “the profile must identify sources of uncertainty, both positive 1347  (opportunities) and negative (threats).” In ICT disciplines, a significant portion of risk 1348  information is collected and reported with regard to weaknesses and threats that could result in 1349  negative consequences. However, positive risks (opportunities) also inform decisions by senior 1350  leaders for setting the risk appetite and tolerance of the enterprise.  1351  From an opportunity standpoint, risk appetite statements can identify areas where the 1352  organization needs to stretch further to reach goals and are expressed as those targeted areas 1353  where some loss is acceptable without crossing important lines of demarcation (e.g., innovative 1354  solutions should be pursued but not at the cost of life, safety, compliance with laws/regulations, 1355  or reputation). Understanding that private-sector organizations pursue risk as part of their growth 1356  strategies and competitive advantage, this aspect should not be forgotten. Similarly, public-sector 1357  agencies typically have stretch goals to keep up with industry needs, customer expectations, 1358  market demands, or other influences. 1359  An example of identifying positive risks is conducting a SWOT analysis that considers strengths 1360  and weaknesses as well as threats and opportunities. Consider, for example, an organization that 1361  is evaluating moving a major financial system from an in-house data center to a commercial 1362  hosting provider. If the organization maintains vast amounts of land and warehouses, the move 1363  could be considered a strength of the organization, and they might increase revenue by offering 1364  space to a commercial vendor to host both their own and other organizations’ data centers. The 1365  Federal Government has realized many opportunities of this nature, including consolidating 1366  payroll functions under the National Finance Center (NFC) and consolidating reporting 1367  requirements in the Department of Justice Cyber Security Assessment and Management (CSAM) 1368  application. 1369  Section 3.2.2 describes the need to treat threat actors and threat sources as inputs into an 1370  estimation of risk. If the enterprise chooses to include positive risk scenarios in the register, then 1371  the process should similarly consider sources of opportunity that might provide benefits. A 1372  consideration of both threats and opportunities may enable discussions regarding the benefits and 1373  risks of a particular endeavor. Alternatively, the organization could manage an opportunity risk 1374  register separately from the traditional threat-based risk register since positive risks (i.e., 1375  opportunities) often have to be assessed on a slightly different scale. 1376  NIST SP 800-221 ipd ENTERPRISE IMPACT OF INFORMATION  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  AND COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY RISK  31  In addition to the threat modeling examples above, methods for identifying ICT-related 1377  opportunities are also available and could be as simple as an employee suggestion box. Industry 1378  publications, such as those from commercial industry associations and agencies like NIST, 1379  regularly provide information and ideas regarding potential innovations or advances for areas 1380  such as supply chain, privacy, and cybersecurity improvements. 1381  Numerous formal methods are available for identifying opportunities, including: 1382  ● Brainstorming – A group innovation technique, often led by a facilitator, that elicits views 1383  from participants to identify and describe opportunities 1384  ● Delphi – A procedure to gain consensus from a group of subject matter experts using one or 1385  more individual questionnaires that are collected and collated to identify opportunities to 1386  pursue 1387  ● Ideation – A consistent process of observing an environment, discerning opportunities for 1388  improvement, experimenting with possible resolutions, and developing innovative solutions 1389  The same formal methods can be used for determining other inputs, such as those described in 1390  Sections 3.2.3 and 3.2.4. 1391  With regard to positive risk response, consider the previous example of an organization that has 1392  identified the positive risk of increasing revenue by providing physical space for a commercial 1393  vendor to offer an outsourcing service. Analysis of the risk has determined that the opportunity 1394  would be highly beneficial to the enterprise. The colocation also provides a moderate opportunity 1395  to improve availability as an element of supply chain risk management. The Risk Response Type 1396  column of the risk register should also be updated using a response type from Table 5, the 1397  comment field updated to contain information pertinent to the opportunity, and the residual risk 1398  uncertainty of not realizing the opportunity calculated. 1399  With these controls and methods in place and assessed as effective, the remaining risks can be 1400  analyzed to determine the residual impact, likelihood, and exposure, as described in Section 3.3. 1401  If the residual exposure falls within risk tolerance levels, then stakeholders can proceed in 1402  gaining the benefits of the opportunity. Each of these values is added to the risk register for 1403  enterprise reporting and monitoring. 1404  Where positive risks are to be considered and included in risk registers, there are four generally 1405  used response types, as described in Table 6. 1406  Table 6: Response Types for Positive ICT Risks 1407  Type Description  Realize Eliminate uncertainty to make sure the opportunity is actualized (sometimes referenced as exploit).  Share Allocate ownership to another party that is better able to capture the opportunity.  Enhance Increase the probability and positive impact of an opportunity (e.g., hire a risk management staff  member to better focus on an organization’s privacy risk and data processing protections).  Accept Take advantage of an opportunity if it happens to present itself (e.g., identify and prioritize those  supply chain risk gaps that should be addressed at the first opportunity).  NIST SP 800-221 ipd ENTERPRISE IMPACT OF INFORMATION  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  AND COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY RISK  32  As with negative risks, positive entries in the ICT risk registers should be normalized and 1408  aggregated into the enterprise-level risk register. 1409  As shown in Figure 9, this publication focuses on the integration of ICT risk from various 1410  disciplines in support of an ERM integration cycle. The document acknowledges the need for 1411  ongoing bidirectional communication between ERM and risk programs, recognizing that the risk 1412  disciplines both inform and receive direction from ERM. It shows that the communication of risk 1413  appetite statements from the ERM portfolio is a way for risk programs to better identify and 1414  monitor risks using a variety of related methods such as risk tolerance statements, key 1415  performance indicators, key risk indicators, and controls. Similarly, this publication formalizes 1416  the use of risk registers to communicate risks and risk responses among program and portfolio 1417  levels. It highlights industry practices for coordination through elevation of risks for oversight 1418  and escalating risks for higher-level ownership. 1419  NIST SP 800-221 ipd ENTERPRISE IMPACT OF INFORMATION  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  AND COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY RISK  33  4 Building ERRs and ERPs from ICTRM-Specific Risk Registers 1420  The achievement of defined expectations is 1421  conveyed through risk registers that 1422  document and communicate risk decisions. 1423  Risk assessment results and risk response 1424  actions at the system level are reflected in 1425  the ICT risk registers. The registers from 1426  multiple systems are collated, aggregated, 1427  and normalized, then provided to business 1428  managers at the organization level to 1429  provide a composite risk understanding. 1430  Those managers can evaluate results and 1431  refine risk tolerance criteria to optimize 1432  value delivery, resource utilization, and risk. 1433  The enterprise-level aggregation of all the 1434  various risk registers into an enterprise risk 1435  register (ERR), then a prioritized enterprise 1436  risk profile (ERP), enables senior leaders to 1437  monitor risk responses while considering the 1438  expectations set.  1439  This section takes a closer look at how ICT 1440  risk registers are used as the inputs for 1441  building an ERR and ultimately an ERP, as 1442  depicted in Figure 9. 1443  4.1 Creating and Maintaining 1444  Enterprise-Level ICT Risk Registers 1445  A key outcome of the risk identification and 1446  communications elements is the ability to 1447  create enterprise-level ICT risk registers as 1448  input to the broader ERR (Section 4.2). As 1449  described throughout Section 3, the 1450  application of a consistent risk register with agreed-upon criteria and categories enables various 1451  data points to be normalized, aggregated, and sorted into an enterprise view. 1452  Risk registers are composed and maintained at all levels: enterprise (including higher-level and 1453  lower-level enterprises), organization (including suborganizations and business units), and 1454  system.17 The vertical columns in Figure 4 should not be interpreted as guidance to address such 1455  risks as isolated silos, but rather that information for various types of ICT risks should be shared 1456  with those in higher organizational levels for the benefit of the whole enterprise. Similarly, 1457  ICTRM should not be isolated at only one organizational level nor within a single ICT risk 1458  17  OMB Circular A-130 defines an information system as “a discrete set of information resources organized for the collection,  processing, maintenance, use, sharing, dissemination, or disposition of information.” [OMB-A123]  Figure 9: ICTRM Integration Cycle  NIST SP 800-221 ipd ENTERPRISE IMPACT OF INFORMATION  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  AND COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY RISK  34  discipline. Instead, those in an organizational level should collaborate and communicate about 1459  issues, problems, and opportunities identified. As lessons learned about successes and challenges 1460  are shared among peers, that information can be conveyed to other organizations and to 1461  enterprise management, including by using risk registers and RDRs. 1462  For each risk discipline, as the risk registers from each system and organization are completed, 1463  they are provided to the designated risk officers at the relevant level (i.e., system or organization) 1464  and shared with senior management to conduct the following actions: 1) normalize (e.g., ensure 1465  definitions and values as recorded by various enterprise entities are consistent and remove 1466  duplicate risk reporting) and 2) aggregate risks in similar categories into a concise view. 1467  To support the subsequent aggregation of various risk registers, enterprise risk guidance should 1468  identify the enterprise objectives to which various types of ICT risk should be aligned. The ERP 1469  reflects risks that may have impact in each of four discrete enterprise objectives: strategic, 1470  operations, reporting, and compliance. These same four objectives were key factors in the 1471  original COSO ERM framework and are often used as guideposts for enterprise risk reporting. 1472  Clear direction from senior leaders about how to align various types of ICT risk with enterprise 1473  objectives will help enable subsequent aggregation, normalization, and prioritization. Objective 1474  alignments include: 1475  ● Strategic risks related to the implementation of a new service offering; opportunities for 1476  innovation within an ICT area; change management improvements and challenges. 1477  ● Operations issues regarding product or service quality and resilience (e.g., supply chain 1478  interruption that disables a manufacturing process); processes and procedures for privacy 1479  risk posture; operational technology considerations; business continuity/disaster recovery 1480  issues. 1481  ● Reporting regarding ICT risk issues, including insurance considerations and material 1482  risk factors that affect disclosures or statutory reporting. 1483  ● Compliance risks where a negative event might result in a failure to meet a contractual 1484  service agreement or in a regulatory penalty or fine. 1485  Direction may be needed regarding how to account for those risks that cross multiple boundaries 1486  and how each organizational level should perform an aggregation of subordinate risk registers. 1487  4.2 Creating the Enterprise Risk Register (ERR) 1488  Enterprise risk officers collect all risk inputs, including the ICT risk registers, and analyze 1489  potential risk events, consequences, and impacts at the enterprise level to create the ERR. The 1490  ERR is subsequently prioritized to create the enterprise risk profile (ERP) discussed in Section 1491  4.3, which enables key executive stakeholders to stay aware of critical risks, including those that 1492  are ICT-related.  1493  As part of their risk guidance, enterprise leaders designate ERM process participants and the 1494  responsibilities of each role. That guidance should declare which role is responsible for creating 1495  and maintaining the ERR, how frequently it will be updated, and how the risks within it will be 1496  communicated to various stakeholders. This document will assume that role to be assigned to the 1497  NIST SP 800-221 ipd ENTERPRISE IMPACT OF INFORMATION  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  AND COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY RISK  35  enterprise risk officer, although the responsibility could fall upon any designated party, including 1498  other roles as described in Section 3.1.1. 1499  The creation and maintenance of the ERR also supports a periodic review of enterprise risk 1500  guidance, including risk definitions, context, and risk appetite criteria. It provides an opportunity 1501  to review and validate enterprise definitions for risks, risk categories, and risk assessment scales. 1502  If any changes or updates to the risk context or guidance need to occur, the enterprise risk officer 1503  (or equivalent) is likely to have sufficient seniority to ensure appropriate updates to those 1504  enterprise processes. Practitioners should consider any positive risks present in the rolled-up 1505  report and add other opportunities as inputs to the ERR. 1506  Figure 10 provides a notional ERR that combines both federal agency and critical infrastructure 1507  risks, illustrating the integration of various ICT risks alongside other key enterprise risks. 1508  1509  Figure 10: Notional Example of an ICT-Inclusive ERR 1510  NIST SP 800-221 ipd ENTERPRISE IMPACT OF INFORMATION  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  AND COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY RISK  36  This example illustrates the inclusion of a positive risk (item 2) beside negative risks. Of course, 1511  an actual ERR would include many more entries, both positive and negative. Most of the 1512  columns in the example are the same as their lower-level risk register counterparts. The notable 1513  exception is that the example ERR splits the Current Assessment—Impact into three columns, 1514  which are described in Table 7. 1515  Table 7: Descriptions of Additional Notional ERR Elements 1516  ERR Element Description  Current  Assessment— Financial Impact  Analysis of the financial potential benefits or consequences resulting from this scenario,  including cost considerations. While this element could be quantitative, it is often qualitative  (e.g., high, moderate, low) at the enterprise level. Financial considerations may be expressed  as 1) capital expenditures that represent a longer-term business expense, such as property,  facilities, or equipment, and 2) operating expenses that support day-to-day operations.  Current  Assessment— Reputation Impact  Analysis of the potential benefits or consequences that the scenario might have on the  stature, credibility, or effectiveness of the enterprise. Some enterprises perform a formal  sentiment analysis using commercial services or other technical tools to support assessment.  Current  Assessment— Mission Impact  Analysis of the potential benefits or consequences that the scenario might have on the ability  of the enterprise to successfully achieve mission objectives  1517  As was described for lower-level risk registers, there is value in both a single point of reference 1518  (the ERR) and detailed risk information (the RDR). The ERR provides an easily consumed 1519  summary for understanding the risk landscape, while the RDR provides additional information. 1520  The RDR also enables the documentation of additional information, such as historical 1521  information, detailed risk analysis data, and information about individual and organizational 1522  accountability. Additional information for inclusion in an enterprise RDR might include: 1523  ● Detailed risk information (e.g., full risk statement, detailed scenario description, key risk 1524  indicators, enterprise status for this particular risk) 1525  ● Information regarding various risk roles (e.g., risk owner, risk manager, risk approver) 1526  and affected stakeholders 1527  ● Historical timeline information (e.g., last update date, next expected review) 1528  ● Risk analysis information, including the aggregate understanding of threats, 1529  weaknesses/pre-existing conditions, resources affected, and impact 1530  ● Detailed risk response information (e.g., responses implemented, status and results of 1531  previous responses, additional responses planned) 1532  The ERR provides input for those performing enterprise risk oversight, such as an executive risk 1533  committee. By tracking the status of each risk, including the exposure value of each, enterprise 1534  stakeholders can identify the most relevant risks (e.g., a top ten list that may be used to further 1535  inform enterprise risk decisions). Summary reports about the highest-priority risks may be used 1536  to inform stakeholders (e.g., for federal departments and agencies, those in an oversight role such 1537  as Congress, OMB, or GAO) about existing risks, risk responses, and planned activities. 1538  Since it is difficult to compare dissimilar risk exposures, such as employee retention and disaster 1539  recovery, risks are often translated into financial impact and may be further broken down into the 1540  direct cost (i.e., the impact of a given risk on the capital budget and operating expenses), the 1541  NIST SP 800-221 ipd ENTERPRISE IMPACT OF INFORMATION  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  AND COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY RISK  37  financial cost of reputational damage, and direct financial implications of impact on the 1542  enterprise mission. The relative financial impact of each type of risk can provide further input 1543  into risk management prioritization and monitoring decisions for enterprise risk managers. 1544  Reputation exposure can be similarly determined in the ERR (e.g., by the chief risk officer) by 1545  combining high-impact attacks, enterprise sector, and consequences with a histogram (trend) 1546  analysis of stakeholder sentiment (for each stakeholder type). This last action of prioritization 1547  creates the ERP, as discussed in Section 4.3.  1548  For federal agencies, OMB Circular A-123 requires that the enterprise risk register consider both 1549  inherent and residual risk.18 The COSO ERM Framework [COSOERM] further describes these 1550  terms and differentiates between actual residual risk and target (desired) risk: 1551  • “Inherent risk is the risk to an entity in the absence of any direct or focused actions by 1552  management to alter its severity.” 1553  • “Target residual risk is the amount of risk that an entity prefers to assume in the pursuit 1554  of its strategy and business objectives, knowing that management will implement or has 1555  implemented direct or focused actions to alter the severity of the risk.” 1556  • “Actual residual risk is what remains after management has taken action to alter its 1557  severity. Actual residual risk should be equal to or less than the target residual risk.” 1558  OMB A-123 examples reference inherent risk that describes “conditions in the absence of risk 1559  management actions.” There are often likely to be at least some elements that help mitigate risks, 1560  so this publication typically refers to current risk rather than inherent risk when representing a 1561  baseline risk posture. 1562  4.3 Developing the Enterprise Risk Profile (ERP) 1563  As risk information is transmitted up from lower levels of the organization, each level’s risk 1564  register should contain the pertinent information for creating a prioritized risk profile for the 1565  level immediately above it. For example, a subject matter expert in a particular ICT risk 1566  discipline might provide their own prioritization of risks within their discipline, for consideration 1567  by the next level of risk experts.  1568  Subordinate organizations’ impacts may be different, similar, conflicting, overlapping, or 1569  unavailable and must be properly combined by financial and mission analysis at the level 1570  immediately above the reporting organization. While the impacts of ICT risk on various assets 1571  may be determined at lower levels, the overall cash flow and capital implications of all of the 1572  risks can only be normalized and aggregated (and recorded in the ERR) by enterprise fiduciaries 1573  (e.g., CFOs). Similarly, enterprise mission impacts must be aggregated and expressed by those 1574  senior executives most directly accountable to stakeholders. 1575  The ERR informs the ERP once the risks are prioritized at the highest level of the risk 1576  management function in the enterprise, as depicted in Figure 11. The ERP is a subset of carefully 1577  selected risks from the larger ERR.  1578  18  While both Circular A-123 and some COSO documents reference inherent risk, this publication focuses on current risk.  NIST SP 800-221 ipd ENTERPRISE IMPACT OF INFORMATION  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  AND COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY RISK  38  1579  Figure 11: Notional Example of an Enterprise Risk Profile 1580  The ERP reflects assessments of mission, financial, and reputation exposures organized 1581  according to the four enterprise objectives. They may be full-value exposures or modified (and 1582  so noted) by the likelihood assessments of enterprise leaders. At the top enterprise level, ERM 1583  officials have the prerogative to add their own judgment of likelihood and impact as part of the 1584  normalization process, along with other members of the enterprise risk executive function. While 1585  the ERM process helps drive the discussion and calculation of likely risk scenarios, recent 1586  natural disasters have demonstrated that actual consequences can far exceed initial loss 1587  expectations. Enterprise executives should continually observe industry trends and actual 1588  occurrences to readjust likelihood and impact estimations and reserves based on a changing risk 1589  landscape. ERPs should also reflect comparable occurrence incidents and trends for the subject 1590  enterprise and peer organizations. 1591  NIST SP 800-221 ipd ENTERPRISE IMPACT OF INFORMATION  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  AND COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY RISK  39  The ERP supports the governance and management for measuring significant financial, 1592  reputational, and missional impact (consequences). Some enterprises may also use this taxonomy 1593  to support a broader risk breakdown structure (RBS), a topic that may be explored in a future 1594  NIST publication. As shown in Figure 12, considerations include: 1595  ● Financial impact – Various risk scenarios are converted into actual capital and 1596  operational expenses, enabling executive leaders to conduct a fiscally responsible 1597  cost/benefit analysis that considers the recommended strategies for risk response. (These 1598  presentations are equivalent to the financial disclosures in Form 10-Q and Form 10-K 1599  filings to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission [SEC] by commercial public 1600  companies each quarter and for Form 8-K filings as risk incidents occur.) 1601  ● Reputation impact – While subordinate risk registers describe risk scenarios, including 1602  those that may impact reputation, executive leaders record the evaluation of 1603  consequences on the enterprise’s reputation. This also supports consideration of other 1604  downstream impacts, such as financial losses or credit risk, that are likely to result from 1605  damage to reputation. 1606  ● Mission impact – Executive leaders record the evaluation of consequences on the overall 1607  ability for the enterprise to conduct its mission and achieve strategic objectives. (Mission 1608  impact in commercial public enterprises is often expressed in Share Value/Market Cap 1609  and Share Volatility tables, also disclosed in SEC filings and shareholder 1610  communications.) 1611  These three high-level impact considerations are then used in conjunction with other enterprise 1612  risk responses to determine tolerances, allocations, and disclosures commensurate with risk 1613  exposure. 1614  4.4 Translating the ERP to Inform Leadership Decisions 1615  For some organizations, the information from the ERP will need to be provided to senior 1616  managers that have a fiduciary duty to remain aware of and help manage risks. In this way, 1617  enterprise leaders will have the necessary information and opportunity to consider risk exposures 1618  as factors for budgets or corporate balance sheet reporting. Both private-sector and public-sector 1619  enterprises will benefit from the use of this risk register integration process; creation of an ERP 1620  is mandated by OMB Circular A-123 for federal agencies.19 (Section B1 of OMB A-123 refers to 1621  the Agency Risk Profile.) The “primary purpose of a risk profile is to provide analysis of the 1622  19  Enterprise-level treatment, communication, and prioritization are discussed in Section 5 of this document.  Figure 12: Impacts (Consequences) of Enterprise Assets for a Business or Agency  NIST SP 800-221 ipd ENTERPRISE IMPACT OF INFORMATION  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  AND COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY RISK  40  risks an [enterprise] faces toward achieving its strategic objectives arising from its activities and 1623  operations, and to identify appropriate options for addressing significant risks. The risk profile 1624  assists in facilitating a determination around the aggregate level and types of risk that the agency 1625  and its management are willing to assume to achieve its strategic objectives.” This prioritization 1626  is supported by one of COSO’s key principles: “The organization prioritizes risks as a basis for 1627  selecting responses to risks.” [COSOERM] Prioritization helps managers to evaluate the costs 1628  and benefits of allocating resources to mitigate one risk compared to another. 1629  Senior leadership must have actionable information for their decision-making (e.g., during 1630  industry boardroom deliberations and their federal counterparts). Table 8 provides a notional 1631  Enterprise Risk Profile Supplement that reflects a portfolio evaluation of various organizational 1632  risk profiles. This information, having been populated and prioritized, directly informs executive 1633  decision-making. 1634  Table 8: Notional Enterprise Risk Portfolio View for a Private Enterprise 1635  Financial Risk Profile  Current Period Previous Period  Net Revenue Capital Free Cash  Flow Net Revenue Capital Free Cash  Flow  Enterprise  Dept A  Dept B  …  Dept N  Reputation Risk Profile  Current Period Previous Period  Public Regulators Partners Public Regulators Partners  Enterprise  Dept A  Dept B  …  Dept N  Mission Risk Profile  Current Period Previous Period  Product/Service  Capability Philanthropy Share Value Product/Service  Capability Philanthropy Share Value  Enterprise  Dept A  Dept B  …  Dept N  NIST SP 800-221 ipd ENTERPRISE IMPACT OF INFORMATION  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  AND COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY RISK  41  5 Enterprise Strategy for ICT Risk Coordination 1636  As part of their governance responsibilities, executive leaders should establish clear and 1637  actionable risk management guidance based on enterprise mission and business objectives. 1638  Expressing clear expectations regarding ICT risk enables participants at each level of the 1639  enterprise to manage uncertainty to an acceptable level. As the risk landscape evolves, such as 1640  due to technological and environmental changes, enterprise leaders should continually review 1641  and adjust the risk strategy. For example, an enterprise subject to outside regulation is likely to 1642  receive specific guidance regarding updated federal statutes and directives that must be 1643  considered in evaluating acceptable risk. 1644  5.1 Risk Integration and Coordination Activities 1645  Figure 13 provides a simplified illustration of risk integration and coordination activities. Each 1646  enterprise is unique, so enterprise leadership may wish to tailor the approach for their unique 1647  circumstances. For example, while risk appetite statements usually originate from the most 1648  senior leaders, those leaders may choose to delegate the creation of ICT risk appetite statements 1649  to a senior ICT risk official. Readers should note that the processes described are cyclical. Early 1650  iterations may include the definition of terms, strategies, and objectives. Subsequent iterations 1651  may focus on refining those objectives based on previous results, observations of the risk 1652  landscape, and changes within the enterprise. 1653  1654  Figure 13: Illustration of Enterprise Risk Management Integration and Coordination 1655  Table 9 describes the process by which senior leaders express expectations and receive results 1656  about managing ICT risk throughout the enterprise. 1657  NIST SP 800-221 ipd ENTERPRISE IMPACT OF INFORMATION  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  AND COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY RISK  42  Table 9: Inputs and Outputs for ERM Governance and Integrated ICTRM 1658  Activity Point Inputs Outputs  1.

Senior leaders and business managers define risk tolerance 1661  direction that is applied at the system level. System-level practitioners interpret those risk 1662  tolerance statements and apply ICTRM activities to achieve risk management objectives. 1663  Through risk monitoring, results are then reviewed to confirm effectiveness, highlight 1664  opportunities for improvement, and identify important trends that might require organization- or 1665  enterprise-level action. The output of this activity helps improve communication about the 1666  performance, risk trends, and opportunities among all levels. The specific process activities will 1667  be based on the risk management methods applied but will generally include those below.1668  NIST SP 800-221 ipd ENTERPRISE IMPACT OF INFORMATION  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  AND COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY RISK  43  1669  Figure 14: Continuous ERM/ICTRM Interaction20 1670  20  This figure demonstrates select communications, processes, and decisions germane to the risk appetite, risk tolerance, and risk register interactions among the three levels of  an enterprise addressed by this report; it is not intended to be exhaustive.  NIST SP 800-221 ipd ENTERPRISE IMPACT OF INFORMATION  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  AND COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY RISK  44  The activities in Figure 14 are discussed below. Further details are provided later in this section. 1671  Risk Context and Strategy Activities 1672  • Based on the enterprise mission, executives identify the systems and services that 1673  represent “mission/business-critical functions” that are essential to the successful 1674  operation of the enterprise. Based on that list, the executives and senior leaders identify 1675  the enterprise-level assets that enable those functions. Those assets inherit the 1676  criticality/priority of the functions they support. Enterprise assets supporting those 1677  objectives are identified (e.g., through a BIA).21 1678  • As described in the previous section, leaders at Level 1 (enterprise) and Level 2 1679  (organization) define specific and measurable risk appetite and risk tolerance statements 1680  that reinforce enterprise mission objectives and organization goals. 1681  • At Level 3 (system), practitioners interpret criticality/priority direction from leaders, 1682  expressed through risk appetite and risk tolerance statements, to determine the ICT assets, 1683  processes, and activities that support mission-essential delivery operations. System-level 1684  assets are categorized based on the sensitivity and criticality to enterprise operations, in 1685  line with the enterprise-level BIA results. Those in various roles (e.g., system owners, 1686  security officers) work together to derive system-level requirements and record impact 1687  understanding in the system BIA register. 1688  Risk Identification Activities 1689  • The value of each asset of a given system (e.g., information type, technical component, 1690  personnel, service provider) is appraised to determine how critical or sensitive it is to the 1691  operation of the system. Subsequent risk decisions depend on an accurate understanding 1692  of the importance of each resource to the system. 1693  • For each of these components, the practitioner identifies threat sources that might have a 1694  harmful effect and the vulnerabilities or conditions that might enable such an effect. To 1695  complete development of the risk scenario, the practitioner determines the adverse effect 1696  of the threat source exploiting the vulnerable conditions. The scenario is recorded in the 1697  risk register’s Risk Description column. The category for the scenario is recorded in the 1698  Risk Category column based on enterprise criteria to support risk correlation, 1699  aggregation, and reporting. 1700  Risk Analysis Activities 1701  • The practitioner performs risk analysis to determine the likelihood that the threat events 1702  and vulnerable conditions would result in harmful impacts to the system asset. Similarly, 1703  the practitioner analyzes the impact value and calculates the risk exposure using the 1704  methodology defined in the enterprise risk strategy (e.g., as the product of [risk 1705  likelihood] x [risk impact].) The results of these analyses are recorded in the risk 1706  register’s Current Assessment column as “Likelihood,” “Impact,” and “Exposure.” 1707  21  For practitioners integrating cybersecurity with ERM, NIST IR 8286D, Using Business Impact Analysis to Inform Risk  Prioritization and Response provides additional information about the use of BIA. [IR8286D]  NIST SP 800-221 ipd ENTERPRISE IMPACT OF INFORMATION  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  AND COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY RISK  45  Risk Response Activities 1708  • The determined exposure is compared with the risk tolerance. 1709  o If exposure is within risk tolerance limits, the risk may be accepted. 1710  • If exposure exceeds tolerable levels of risk, practitioners can consider whether they can 1711  achieve risk tolerance through other forms of risk response. 1712  o In many cases, controls may be applied to mitigate risk by reducing its likelihood 1713  or impact to a tolerable level. Controls should be implemented with a 1714  corresponding performance scale (i.e., KPI), which is used as the basis for KRIs. 1715  o Risk response may also include risk transfer, also known as risk sharing. For 1716  example, an organization might hire an external organization to process sensitive 1717  transactions (e.g., payment card transactions), thus reducing the likelihood that 1718  such sensitive data would be processed by an in-house system. Another common 1719  risk transfer method involves the use of ICT insurance policies that can help 1720  reduce the economic impact if an adverse event occurs. 1721  o In some cases, it might be determined that the exposure exceeds risk tolerance and 1722  cannot be brought within limits through any combination of mitigation or risk 1723  transfer. In this case, practitioners (e.g., the system owner) may need to work with 1724  Level 2 leaders to revisit the risk tolerance itself. This negotiation presents an 1725  opportunity for the Level 2 and Level 3 managers to determine the best course of 1726  action to refine risk direction in light of mission objectives (e.g., through an 1727  exception process, an adjustment to the risk tolerance statement, or increased 1728  security requirements for the relevant system). In any case, stakeholders will have 1729  applied a proactive approach to balancing risk and value. 1730  o If an unacceptable ICT risk cannot be adequately treated in a cost-effective 1731  manner, that risk must be avoided. Such a condition may require a significant 1732  redesign of the system or service. These circumstances should be rare, and they 1733  highlight the value of risk coordination early in the system engineering process. 1734  Notably, risk avoidance is not the same as ignoring a risk. 1735  5.1.2 Risk Monitoring and Communication Activities 1736  As described in Section 3.6, risk managers throughout the enterprise must be informed about 1737  objectives, results, priorities, and opportunities that result from the risk responses above. A key 1738  purpose of the various risk registers is to enable ongoing monitoring of enterprise risk activities. 1739  Much of that monitoring occurs through observations of performance metrics, including those 1740  that indicate changes in risk (KRIs). KRIs inform organizations whether controls are adequately 1741  addressing risk and whether risks are changing over time. When KRIs fall outside of pre-1742  established thresholds, this indicates that a risk response is beyond acceptable levels. In this case, 1743  organizations should evaluate risks and make any necessary adjustments to controls. Results of 1744  risk activities and decisions are recorded in the risk register. 1745  Table 109 provides several examples of ICT-related risk appetite, risk tolerance, controls, KPIs, 1746  and leading and lagging KRIs. These all help support the Monitor-Evaluate-Adjust (MEA) cycle 1747  depicted in Section 3.6, Figure 8. 1748  NIST SP 800-221 ipd ENTERPRISE IMPACT OF INFORMATION  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  AND COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY RISK  46  Table 10: Notional ICT-Related Examples Supporting the MEA Cycle 1749  It is important for enterprise processes to ensure adequate communication of risk that has been 1750  accepted (and risk that is implicitly accepted, such as through an exception process). A key 1751  purpose of the various risk registers and reporting methods is to ensure that adequate governance 1752  information is available to monitor enterprise risk decisions. 1753  Risk activities may also be informed through the integration of relevant internal and external 1754  audit findings. Significant audit findings often have enterprise-level impacts. However, lower-1755  severity findings may spread through multiple systems to create risk in aggregate if they are not 1756  addressed adequately. The coordination of audit findings may span multiple levels of the 1757  enterprise. For example, as operational teams address shortcomings or system deficiencies at the 1758  system level, key findings might be communicated and tracked by an audit committee 1759  (organization level). As responses to findings occur and are documented (such as through a 1760  corrective action plan), they assist in the planning of subsequent ERM. 1761  The process continues until all ICT assets and processes have been evaluated for risk from 1762  currently understood threats and vulnerabilities. For some enterprises, the composite set of 1763  system risks, responses applied, and other relevant artifacts will be reviewed by a senior official 1764  Example 1 Example 2 Example 3  Risk  Appetite  Mission-critical systems must  be protected from known  cybersecurity vulnerabilities.  In keeping with the enterprise  designation as a data processor,  as described in the GDPR  (European Union General Data  Protection Regulation), all  personal data processed is kept  confidential.  Our customers associate reliability  with our company’s performance,  so outsourced hosting services  must minimize outages for any  customer-facing websites.  Risk  Tolerance  Systems designated as  mission-critical must be  patched against critical  software vulnerabilities  (severity score of 10) within 14  days of discovery.  While there may be some  tolerance for limited low-risk  corporate information  disclosures, there is zero  tolerance for disclosure of PII.  Regional managers may permit  website outages by supply chain  partners, but those must not  exceed two hours and may affect  no more than five percent of  customers.  Controls  • Periodic vulnerability  assessments  • Patch deployment  capabilities  • Authentication method(s)  • PII processing and  transparency policy  • Authority to process PII  • Audit log alerting/evaluation  • Service level agreements  • Redundant provider circuits  • Web load balancers  • Web servers  KPIs • Percentage of vulnerabilities  patched • Days without a loss of PII • Outage time in hours  Leading  KRIs  • Number of computers with  critical vulnerabilities (CVSS  score of 10) that have not  been patched in 10 days  • Failed facility reviews for  unprotected physical records  • Audit log records showing  violation of separation of duty  requirements  • Outages affecting more than five  percent of customers that have  lasted 1.5 hours  • Outages lasting over two hours  and affecting fewer than five  percent of customers  Lagging  KRIs  • Number of computers with  critical vulnerabilities that  have not been patched in 15  days  • One or more violation  indications from data loss  prevention tools  • Current outages affecting more  than five percent of customers  that have lasted more than two  hours  NIST SP 800-221 ipd ENTERPRISE IMPACT OF INFORMATION  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  AND COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY RISK  47  to confirm that risk decisions and risk responses align with risk tolerance and risk appetite 1765  directives.22 1766  Subsequently, risk registers for various risk management disciplines from throughout the 1767  organization level are normalized and aggregated to provide a composite view of the risk posture 1768  and decisions for that organization. As Level 2 managers consider feedback from system-level 1769  risk activities, they may decide to refine risk tolerance levels. It may be that the aggregate risk 1770  across multiple systems represents too great an exposure and needs to be reduced. In other cases, 1771  based on successful risk management results, stakeholders may be able to permit a little more 1772  risk in some areas if such a decision would support mission objectives and potentially save 1773  resources or allow them to be directed to areas that require additional resources to meet expected 1774  risk tolerances. 1775  Similar reviews and refinement occur at Level 1 to support enterprise governance and risk 1776  management decisions. Some types of enterprises may be required to formally disclose risk 1777  factors (e.g., through annual reports), and this aggregate understanding of ICT risks and risk 1778  decisions can support their fiduciary responsibilities. These activities may also help others, such 1779  as Federal Government agencies, to comply with mandatory requirements, such as those 1780  established by OMB. 1781  Interpreting risk tolerance at Level 3, practitioners develop requirements and apply controls to 1782  achieve an acceptable level of risk. This process helps to ensure that risk management occurs in a 1783  cost-effective way. As an example, consider a global retail firm where a system owner of a 1784  customer-facing website will select controls that will ensure adherence to availability service 1785  levels. In deciding which controls to apply, the system owner collaborates with a security team to 1786  consider methods to meet service level objectives. The team can contact the local power utility 1787  supplier to determine electrical availability history and gather other information regarding the 1788  likelihood of a loss of power to the important website. This additional information might help the 1789  system owner decide whether to invest in a backup generator to ensure sufficient power 1790  availability. 1791  Results from previous assessments can be useful for estimating the likelihood of achieving risk 1792  goals in the future. The team would then move to the next risk scenario (e.g., perhaps an internet 1793  service outage) and review the history and reliability of the organization’s telecommunications 1794  provider to ascertain the likelihood and impact of a loss of service. Iterating through each 1795  potential risk, as described in Figure 14, practitioners can develop a risk-based approach to 1796  fulfilling risk management objectives based on risk appetite and risk tolerance. This, in turn, 1797  helps risk practitioners demonstrate how their actions directly support mission objectives and 1798  enterprise success. 1799  22  For Federal Government agencies, much of their ICT is accounted for under what is considered a FISMA system (Federal  Information Security Modernization Act) and thus subject to FISMA privacy and security requirements, so the system  authorization process might represent an example of this cycle.  NIST SP 800-221 ipd ENTERPRISE IMPACT OF INFORMATION  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  AND COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY RISK  48  5.2 Aggregation and Normalization of Risk Registers 1800  The value of using consistent risk registers for ICT uncertainty should now be clear. The precise 1801  contents and format will vary by enterprise but will generally follow the structure that has been 1802  illustrated throughout this publication. 1803  5.2.1 Aggregation of ICT Risk Information 1804  The activities described earlier provide guidance to help complete the risk register for a given 1805  system, using that form to record information about known risk scenarios, analysis of their 1806  impacts, and actual or planned activities to respond to those risks. 1807  Aggregation activities are performed among the hierarchical levels shown previously. System-1808  level risk registers are combined with others from the same lower-level organization (e.g., 1809  business department, branch office, division). In a similar way, the now-combined risk registers 1810  at the organization level (e.g., business unit, government bureau) and enterprise level are 1811  aggregated and normalized. The method for managing the risk ID is up to the practitioner, but a 1812  source identifier might be needed to provide traceability to the original register (e.g., “System A” 1813  risk register ID #1 might be tagged as aggregated risk ID A-1). 1814  5.2.2 Normalization of Risk Register Information 1815  While aggregation is occurring, the ICT risk manager will also be normalizing the information 1816  contained in the various risk registers. As data points are brought together, there will likely be 1817  some risks that occur so infrequently (or are of low enough consequence) that they do not merit 1818  inclusion in the next-level register. Decisions about what to integrate and how to do so depend 1819  on the use of a common risk rating scheme that enables risk assessments to be translated and 1820  integrated at higher enterprise levels. At a minimum, the normalization process at the higher 1821  level (for example, for the ERR) should use the same rating criteria to enable comparison and 1822  tracking. This typically includes definitions for how negative (and positive) consequences and 1823  likelihood are to be measured to allow comparability across assessment results. Risk criteria may 1824  also describe how time factors, such as risk velocity, should be considered in determining the 1825  risk severity. As noted in this publication, risk criteria may consider the organization’s objectives 1826  and internal/external context. Criteria for risk escalation or risk elevation may also be considered 1827  as part of the equation for whether specific ICT risks meet the minimum threshold for enterprise-1828  level discussion. For example, the enterprise may note shared risks that represent a broad threat 1829  that would benefit from centralized risk mitigation or a reputational risk that demands immediate 1830  preventive action. 1831  During normalization, risk managers review the results from the various risk registers to support 1832  consistent risk treatment and communication. Some examples of ICT risk normalization are 1833  described in Table 11. A key element of normalization is the identification and resolution of 1834  cases where a similar risk scenario is treated differently by different enterprise participants. 1835  There may be no issue with such a difference since context and circumstances might be different, 1836  but the underlying cause should be understood, and the disparity should be recognized. 1837  NIST SP 800-221 ipd ENTERPRISE IMPACT OF INFORMATION  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  AND COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY RISK  49  Table 11: Examples of ICT Risk Normalization 1838  De-duplicate and  combine identical or  similar risks  ● An external attacker deploys a remote access tool and uses it to exfiltrate the  plans for the company’s upcoming merger.  ● External threat actors steal information about marketing plans through malicious  code deployed in the sales department.  ● Malicious parties plant a web shell in an external site that enables them to access  documents stored in the Legal Affairs shared document folder, resulting in the loss  of critical corporate information.  Reprioritize according to  risk appetite, tolerance,  and sensibilities  ● Since priorities have been established at organization and system levels, it may  be necessary to review their collective priority and recommend adjustments to a  higher or lower priority.  Resolve risk register  disparities  One of two alternatives might be applied:  ● The combined risk description could be listed in the risk register for each risk  response selected by system owners at lower levels. If two system owners had  mitigated the above exfiltration risk and one had chosen to accept it, then the risk  would appear in the combined risk register twice, with each row indicating the  respective response.  ● The combined ICT risk would be included once in the risk register, with both of the  responses included in the Risk Response Type column.  Adjudicate key risks ● Those risks that warrant tracking and further communication in the ERR are  highlighted and reviewed by enterprise-level risk managers.  The categories of each ICT risk in each register are likely to be limited and consistent, so that 1839  column provides a practical key for the initial sorting exercise. After all of the risks at a given 1840  level are combined, aggregation is a straightforward activity but may require some manual 1841  adjustment. Various risk owners will likely use differing risk descriptions for the same scenario. 1842  The risk manager of that business unit would transliterate these ICT risks into a single 1843  representative risk on the business unit’s risk register, perhaps “External malicious party uses 1844  malicious code to exfiltrate sensitive business-related documents.” In this case, the risk must 1845  describe the type of information that is at risk of theft, since the loss of internal business 1846  documents, patient healthcare records, and employee financial information might each represent 1847  differing likelihoods and impacts. The criteria for delineating these factors will be determined by 1848  each enterprise. For example, if sufficiently detailed risk appetite and risk tolerance statements 1849  have been recorded, they might provide input into those risk criteria. 1850  The activities described in this document are solely intended to support public- and private-1851  sector enterprise information gathering and reporting. Actions for an immediate response, 1852  escalation, or notification for any particular adverse event should be handled through the 1853  enterprise’s incident response processes. Similarly, raw risk information from each risk register 1854  should be fully available for any manager’s review. Aggregated summarization is a valuable 1855  reporting tool but should not impede the ability of managers to review specific risk decisions. 1856  Aggregating the risk analysis from multiple risk registers will vary by enterprise, but, for 1857  example, a three-point estimation could be used to complete the likelihood and impact columns 1858  on the combined register. The business unit risk manager could calculate these values using the 1859  lowest observed value as the best case, the highest value as the worst case, and the mean value of 1860  the others as the most likely. That manager could also apply their knowledge of the personnel 1861  and processes used to generate the risk registers, such that, if they know that a particularly 1862  NIST SP 800-221 ipd ENTERPRISE IMPACT OF INFORMATION  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  AND COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY RISK  50  detailed study had been performed to develop one or more of the estimates, that might influence 1863  the understanding of the most likely value. 1864  5.2.3 Integrating Risk Register Details 1865  For some enterprises, aggregation of these risk analysis and risk response values may be more art 1866  than science. Some organizations have skilled practitioners with actuarial experience who can 1867  statistically aggregate multiple data points and draw a scientific conclusion about the likelihood 1868  and impact (and therefore exposure rating) of various risks. Other organizations will simply work 1869  to normalize a list of highs and lows, with risk managers using their best judgment to estimate 1870  the combined exposure. Because the process of analyzing and responding to risk factors is highly 1871  iterative, an enterprise might need to begin with qualitative risk values and identify opportunities 1872  to increasingly apply quantitative approaches as more information and history become available. 1873  Information sharing and communications on risk response is vital as risk response could be 1874  ongoing, iterative, or span different reporting cycles. The information provides valuable data that 1875  will guide enterprise-level risk decisions, but the level of precision needed at higher hierarchical 1876  levels will likely be less than is needed at the system level. 1877  Completion of the remaining columns presents opportunities for enterprise determination as 1878  follows: 1879  • For an aggregation of the risk response cost column, in some cases, an organization-level 1880  risk manager may wish to record a statistically weighted average of the risk response 1881  costs. In other cases, the manager may wish to provide a total cost allocated across all 1882  subsidiary systems and organizations. 1883  • The column for risk owner should indicate an organization-level representative who has 1884  the accountability and authority to manage that risk. Risk ownership is a key information 1885  point that must be carefully considered and applied. The party designated as the risk 1886  owner must be continually knowledgeable about relevant risk conditions and must also 1887  have the accountability and authority to manage the risk. Since risk conditions may 1888  change as information is aggregated, responsibility and accountability should be 1889  periodically reviewed to ensure that the risk owner is the appropriate designee. 1890  • The risk status for each aggregated ICT risk should use a consistent set of indicators. 1891  Status could be a simple indicator (e.g., open, closed, pending) or provide a more detailed 1892  explanation (e.g., “Risk accepted pending review by the Jan. 24 quarterly risk committee 1893  meeting”). 1894  While the methods and algorithms used will vary by enterprise, there should be a consistent risk 1895  aggregation strategy that is expressed as part of a policy within a given enterprise. Given the roll-1896  up process, ICTRM – working in conjunction with enterprise risk managers – can include 1897  relevant risk policy statements, including requirements for registering risks, providing updates 1898  regularly, and communicating risk activities with enterprise managers and leadership. 1899  Through these procedures and policy statements, the various ICT risks are integrated into a 1900  comprehensive ERR. Note that the processes are described as a bottom-up integration, but real-1901  NIST SP 800-221 ipd ENTERPRISE IMPACT OF INFORMATION  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  AND COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY RISK  51  world scenarios are likely to be interactive and iterative. Integration is important for gathering 1902  data and provides opportunities for analysis and adjustment. 1903  5.3 Adjusting Risk Responses 1904  Based on the evaluation, risk managers adjust their risk response approach. In some cases, the 1905  evaluation will provide evidence that risk response has been effective and is efficiently achieving 1906  the necessary level of risk treatment. In other cases, adjustments may be necessary to risk 1907  direction, risk treatment, or both. 1908  Aristotle is commonly credited with teaching that the whole is not the same as the sum of its 1909  parts. Such an observation highlights that the composite set of enterprise risk likelihood and 1910  impact is something besides and not necessarily equivalent to the sum of the risk analyses 1911  described in the various risk registers. 1912  As controls are applied throughout the enterprise, and as indicators are produced (and reported 1913  through metrics), various managers and leaders will consider the evaluation produced in the 1914  previous section. Given the resulting observations, several adjustments may be warranted, as 1915  described below. 1916  • Adjust strategic direction – Based on collective results, senior leaders may update risk 1917  appetite statements to increase or decrease risk limits, including potentially adjusting 1918  specific quantitative direction. In addition to or in place of risk appetite adjustment, risk 1919  tolerance interpretation may similarly be adjusted to take advantage of opportunities or to 1920  reduce the likelihood or impact of harmful risks. 1921  • Adjust risk responses – To address inconsistent responses to risks or to achieve a 1922  different result, leaders may choose to direct specific response actions to one or more risk 1923  scenarios. For example, if some organizations decided to mitigate a given risk type and 1924  others chose to accept it, risk managers may clarify which treatment is the appropriate 1925  response (or clarify the criteria by which that decision is made). As with previous 1926  discussions, this adjustment may either be to reduce the overall exposure by enacting a 1927  more stringent response, or to loosen restrictions to gain some advantage in exchange for 1928  a measured risk increase. Such changes may occur gradually to ensure sufficient ICTRM 1929  at all hierarchical levels. 1930  • Adjust KPIs and KRIs – While the enterprise may adjust its specific direction or 1931  treatment of risk, the result of the evaluation will often be increased monitoring of the 1932  various conditions. Especially when conditions indicate broad variance in resulting 1933  metrics, managers may direct changes to the KPIs and KRIs that are monitored to gain 1934  better visibility. If changes to impact and likelihood cannot be adequately observed with 1935  the current indicators, then different (or additional) metrics may be justified. Increased 1936  frequency is indicated when impact and likelihood change more rapidly than the current 1937  monitoring interval. 1938  The adjustments described are intended to provide improvements that are directly based on the 1939  observations resulting from monitoring and evaluating risk results. Additional adjustments may 1940  be based on external direction, such as requirements by a regulator for increased risk 1941  NIST SP 800-221 ipd ENTERPRISE IMPACT OF INFORMATION  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  AND COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY RISK  52  management or new reporting criteria (e.g., prohibiting sharing or disclosing information from a 1942  smart utility meter about a customer’s usage without that customer’s consent). 1943  5.3.1 Factors Influencing Prioritization 1944  Numerous factors (e.g., financial loss, enterprise reputation, shareholder sentiment) influence 1945  priority and should be included in the enterprise risk strategy. An ICT risk that directly impacts 1946  the mission is likely to be a high priority, but many other considerations – such as agency or 1947  corporate reputation – may move a particular type of risk to the top of the list. Another 1948  consideration could occur if a corporate entity was preparing for a merger. The community has 1949  seen recent examples that have demonstrated that the discovery of an ICT risk can affect the 1950  valuation of an enterprise and subsequent negotiations. There may also be factors that are not 1951  directly related to risk but that could support organizational improvement (e.g., quick wins that 1952  build team confidence and gain momentum, risks related to an objective that leaders have 1953  established as a key priority). Priority values such as low, moderate, and high are often used as 1954  risk prioritization categories. This qualitative approach may be more limiting than quantitative 1955  analysis in that it is easier to sort a range of numerical values – even those that are relatively 1956  close – than it is to sort a list of risks marked “Very High.” In most enterprises, risk strategy 1957  should provide direction for both generalization (e.g., low, moderate, high) and more specific 1958  risk prioritization methods. 1959  5.3.2 ICT Risk Optimization 1960  A key goal of ERM/ICTRM coordination is to help enterprise stakeholders collect various risk 1961  data for decision support, monitoring, and communications. Several foundational definitions are 1962  relevant to properly prioritizing risk at each stage of the life cycle, including aggregating and 1963  prioritizing the risk register data discussed in this document: 1964  • Risk aggregation – The combination of several risks into one risk to develop a more 1965  complete understanding of the overall risk [ISO73]. 1966  • Risk criteria – Terms of reference against which the significance of a risk is evaluated, 1967  such as organizational objectives, internal/external context, and mandatory requirements 1968  (e.g., standards, laws, policies) [ISO73]. 1969  • Risk optimization – A risk-related process to minimize negative and maximize positive 1970  consequences and their respective probabilities; risk optimization depends on risk 1971  criteria, including costs and legal requirements. 1972  The processes to aggregate, prioritize, and optimize risk will be different at each level of the 1973  enterprise, based on the risk criteria relevant to that level. At hierarchically lower levels in an 1974  enterprise, a certain amount of risk prioritization and treatment authority will have been 1975  delegated by the stated risk strategy guidance to streamline operations, but there might need to be 1976  additional collaboration based on observations by those performing oversight at higher levels. 1977  The methods used for optimizing risk are at the discretion of enterprise leaders and are often 1978  carried out by a risk leadership council or other risk governance body. Since capital and 1979  operating expense budgets for risk response are likely to be limited, each method must include a 1980  NIST SP 800-221 ipd ENTERPRISE IMPACT OF INFORMATION  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  AND COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY RISK  53  process for how to respond to those scenarios when funding is not available. Some examples 1981  include: 1982  • Fiscal optimization – A straightforward ranking of risks in descending order from most 1983  impactful to least. Risk managers tally the total risk response costs until funding is 1984  exhausted. 1985  • Algorithmic optimization – The application of mathematical formulas to calculate the 1986  aggregate cost-benefit to the enterprise, given the estimated costs, in a purely mechanical 1987  approach. 1988  • Operational optimization – The selection of those risks from the register that are most 1989  important to operations (based on leadership preferences, mission objectives, and 1990  stakeholder sentiment. Operational coordination depends upon an iterative 1991  communications cycle of risk reporting and analytics. 1992  • Forced ranking optimization – Prioritizing risks in the way that will best use available 1993  resources to achieve the maximum benefit, given specific negative and positive 1994  consequences. Various business drivers and risk consequences have differing weights for 1995  developing a score, helping to move beyond the simplistic “threat multiplied by 1996  vulnerability” approach to build business objectives into that equation. Because these 1997  factors and their weights are based on business drivers, the factors should be defined by 1998  senior stakeholders but can be applied at all levels of the enterprise, subject to adjustment 1999  and refinement. Notably, while forced ranking is often the default method of 2000  optimization, the methods above are equally valid and beneficial to the enterprise. 2001  Ultimately, the optimization performed will likely be some combination of these methods. For 2002  some enterprises, risk optimization may also have a temporal factor. For example, risk owners 2003  might be willing to accept some risk scenarios to reduce expenses and boost profitability near the 2004  end of a fiscal quarter. Those same scenarios might be fully treated in more favorable financial 2005  circumstances. The goal of this report is not to advocate for any particular optimization process 2006  but rather to determine how optimization and prioritization will occur, since these decisions must 2007  precede risk response itself. 2008  Keep in mind that these management processes are iterative. Generally speaking, as risk 2009  information is aggregated throughout the enterprise, more information becomes available about 2010  risk commonalities. As risk managers observe similar types of positive and negative risk events, 2011  they can note contributing factors, highlight common opportunities, and gain a broader 2012  understanding of risk conditions. Because leaders and executives often have a broader view of 2013  factors that contribute to and result from various risks, including ICT risks, they can provide 2014  additional criteria to hierarchically lower levels to help sort and prioritize. 2015  5.3.3 ICT Risk Priorities at Each Enterprise Level 2016  In support of risk prioritization, as with ICT risks themselves, the ranking factors reflect the 2017  various strata of the enterprise. At the system level, the risk register reflects risk priorities related 2018  to particular systems and technologies. The organization level has priorities based on unique 2019  mission and business unit drivers. The enterprise has overarching ICT priorities that may not be 2020  the same as those at lower technical levels of abstraction, and they can be of varying priority 2021  NIST SP 800-221 ipd ENTERPRISE IMPACT OF INFORMATION  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  AND COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY RISK  54  when considered along with other enterprise risks. This balance is foundational to the concept 2022  of ICTRM as an input to ERM. While risks to institutional information and technology are 2023  critical parts of the enterprise and a primary focus of those charged with leading ICTRM, 2024  corporate officers and fiduciaries have a broad perspective and must balance the dozens of types 2025  of uncertainty in the enterprise risk universe. Bidirectional communication is critical, enabling 2026  senior leaders to convey strategy and direction while also enabling the system- and business-2027  level managers to keep leadership informed.  2028  This process does not mean that every system-level risk decision should be elevated to top 2029  leadership, but rather that many risk decisions at the system and organization levels should be 2030  considered provisional and that leaders may subsequently recommend a different priority or 2031  approach based on their understanding of the aggregate impact to enterprise factors (e.g., 2032  revenue, reputation, regulations, political). 2033  5.4 Enterprise Adjustments Based on ICT Risk Results 2034  In many organizations, ICT enables a flexible approach to achieving the enterprise mission and 2035  ensuring stakeholder value. ICT aspects evolve rapidly, as does the ICT risk landscape, so 2036  periodic adjustments to ICTRM are likely to be needed. The Federal Government has observed 2037  that additional technical capabilities are often needed to provide better services to citizens even 2038  as agencies recognize the increased risk presented by the underlying technology. Budgets may 2039  need to be allocated for this emerging technology, and strict guidance on how to manage risk to 2040  that ICT may be provided. Subsequently, results of previous iterations of the ICTRM cycle may 2041  support management decisions to adjust funding and risk parameters to achieve enterprise 2042  objectives. 2043  5.4.1 Adjustments to ICT Program Budget Allocation 2044  In both public- and private-sector enterprises, resource considerations are often described as a 2045  contributing factor for risk. To some extent, the claim that a program “needs more resources” is 2046  justifiable in that there are always more tools, personnel, and services that could be added. 2047  However, effective ICTRM requires a balance among risk optimization, resource optimization, 2048  and the value delivered by the technology being used to support mission objectives. If any of 2049  these three factors results in an imbalance, the solution is untenable. ICTRM informs the 2050  decisions around what areas receive priority within limited budget environments. 2051  The factors that have been discussed thus far can help in evaluating the extent to which the 2052  risk/resource balance is well-tuned. For example, because risk decisions are based on stakeholder 2053  needs (and the resulting enterprise and alignment objectives), ICT activities can be traced back to 2054  mission and business value. 2055  In theory, one can simply build a business case that demonstrates the value proposition of 2056  investment in ICT protection, detection, and response resources. In reality, it can be quite 2057  challenging to directly report the subsequent return on that investment. One way to address this 2058  challenge is by applying detailed risk assessment and reporting activities, such as those described 2059  in this document. Quantitative methods provide specific calculations that enable the risk 2060  practitioner to simulate risk likelihood and financial impact before and after implementation of 2061  NIST SP 800-221 ipd ENTERPRISE IMPACT OF INFORMATION  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  AND COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY RISK  55  the ICT improvement. This then drives a straightforward cost-benefit analysis regarding the 2062  resource investment. 2063  Another budgetary consideration results from the aggregation activities described above. As 2064  managers and leaders review the activities performed and the risk results provided, they may 2065  identify opportunities to centrally fund and operate risk management activities that had 2066  previously been the responsibility of individual system owners. It might make fiscal sense to 2067  combine particular activities to gain efficiencies or reduce duplication. As such opportunities 2068  become apparent during the review of risk register reports and results, leaders may make fiscal 2069  adjustments to gain an advantage. 2070  5.4.2 Adjustments to Risk Appetite and Risk Tolerance 2071  In addition to fiscal considerations, observations during the life cycle may also provide feedback 2072  regarding leaders’ risk criteria regarding risk appetite and tolerance. Figure 14 illustrates several 2073  key decision points, including: 2074  • Risk acceptance at the system level – in selecting the appropriate controls for a given 2075  information system (or shared set of controls), is a risk already acceptable, given the 2076  applicable risk tolerance statements? 2077  o If it is not acceptable, the system owner has the option of applying additional risk 2078  response, either through risk sharing or through mitigation by various controls. 2079  o At times, risk cannot be brought within tolerance through any combination of 2080  controls, or the cost of the controls might be unreasonable for the system. In such 2081  a case, it is possible that there might be limited ability to adjust risk tolerance. In 2082  either case, discussion with decision makers is necessary to determine the 2083  appropriate course of action. That discussion might also support guidance for 2084  other enterprise systems facing similar risk scenarios. 2085  • Additional decision points occur after the aggregation and integration of risk registers at 2086  various levels. As risk managers review the risk registers and RDRs, risk management 2087  results will be compared with stakeholder expectations. Based on the aggregated results, 2088  ICT risk managers might need to consider the following questions: 2089  o Is risk response consistent across various organizational structures and levels? 2090  Based on risk analysis, response, and monitoring results, risk managers may 2091  determine that additional guidance is needed to better achieve repeatable and 2092  reliable risk management activity. Adjustments in policy, procedure, staff 2093  training, and other governance components may be necessary to improve process 2094  maturity. 2095  o Has the risk environment evolved (perhaps due to changes in internal or external 2096  context, such as new regulations or customer agreements) to such an extent that 2097  risk direction or criteria need to be adjusted? If so, this provides an opportunity to 2098  repeat the cycle. 2099  In addition to these programmatic adjustments, specific risk treatment adjustments might be 2100  identified during continuous monitoring and ongoing assessment activities. 2101  NIST SP 800-221 ipd ENTERPRISE IMPACT OF INFORMATION  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  AND COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY RISK  56  5.4.3 Reviewing Whether Constraints Are Overly Stringent 2102  A challenge for senior managers is ensuring that their organizations are permitting enough risk, 2103  especially those risks that help realize benefits (e.g., opportunities, rewards). These introspective 2104  questions help those in risk governance roles identify whether their risk managers are using the 2105  risk governance tools and processes correctly or if those tools and processes need adjustment. 2106  It is rare that an opportunity can be realized without a negative risk. One might also question 2107  why anyone would embark on a circumstance that results in a negative risk without a 2108  corresponding opportunity that makes such an endeavor worthwhile. A basic objective of risk 2109  management programs is to identify individual negative risks so that they can be matched to their 2110  corresponding positive risks, enabling tradeoff analysis. With individual negative risks 2111  identified, the risk program is prepared to move ahead with a risk response should the tradeoff 2112  analysis render a decision to proceed with the positive risk. 2113  5.4.4 Adjustments to Priority 2114  A final program-level adjustment relates to enterprise priorities. ICT risk decisions flow from the 2115  enterprise mission and priorities. This is illustrated by Activity Point 1 in Figure 13 where senior 2116  leaders establish the mission and priorities, which drive strategic objectives and planning, which 2117  are then used to direct ICTRM activities. Subsequently, identified and assessed risks are 2118  recorded in the risk register in accordance with those priorities. The order in which risks are 2119  addressed, the direction of appropriate response, and even the agreement about which risks will 2120  be addressed all derive from the enterprise priorities. For this reason, a key enterprise activity 2121  will be a periodic review of those priorities and the effects that they have on ICTRM. Based on 2122  the results of such reviews, priorities might be adjusted or clarified to ensure continued 2123  alignment between ICTRM activity and mission objectives. 2124  NIST SP 800-221 ipd ENTERPRISE IMPACT OF INFORMATION  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  AND COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY RISK  57  References 2125  [COSOERM] Committee of Sponsoring Organizations (COSO) of the Treadway  Commission (2017) Enterprise Risk Management—Integrating with  Strategy and Performance, Executive Summary.

This 110  document is intended to help individual organizations within an enterprise improve their ICT risk 111  management (ICTRM). This can enable enterprises and their component organizations to better 112  identify, assess, and manage their ICT risks in the context of their broader mission and business 113  objectives. This document explains the value of rolling up and integrating risks that may be 114  addressed at lower system and organizational levels to the broader enterprise level by focusing 115  on the use of ICT risk registers as input to the enterprise risk profile. 116  Keywords 117  enterprise risk management (ERM); enterprise risk profile (ERP); enterprise risk register (ERR); 118  information and communications technology (ICT); ICT risk; ICT risk management (ICTRM); 119  ICT risk measurement; risk appetite; risk register; risk tolerance. 120  Audience 121  The primary audience for this publication is both Federal Government and non-Federal 122  Government professionals at all levels who understand ICT risk management (ICTRM) for one 123  or more ICT domains, but may be unfamiliar with ERM. The secondary audience includes both 124  federal and non-Federal Government corporate officers, high-level executives, ERM officers and 125  staff members, and others who understand ERM but may be unfamiliar with the unique 126  characteristics of ICTRM. All readers are expected to gain an improved understanding of how 127  ICTRM and ERM relate to each other, as well as the benefits of integrating their use. 128  Trademark Information 129  All registered trademarks and trademarks belong to their respective organizations. 130  Document Conventions 131  For the purposes of this document, “assets” are defined as technologies that may compose an 132  information or communications system. The term “asset” or “assets” is used in multiple 133  NIST SP 800-221 ipd ENTERPRISE IMPACT OF INFORMATION  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  AND COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY RISK  iii  frameworks and documents. Examples include laptop computers, desktop computers, servers, 134  sensors, data, mobile phones, tablets, routers, and switches. In instances where the authors mean 135  “assets” as they might be discussed at the enterprise level, the word “asset” will be preceded by 136  words such as “enterprise,” “high-level,” “balance sheet,” or “Level 1” to differentiate context. 137  This document uses the phrase “information and communications technology” for ICT. As of 138  this writing, both this phrase and the same phrase with “communication” instead of 139  “communications” are widely used. The phrases essentially mean the same thing. 140  This document references two types of controls, each of which is essential and should not be 141  confused with the other: 142  • Internal controls are the overarching mechanisms used to achieve and monitor 143  enterprise objectives. The COSO Internal Control – Integrated Framework defines 144  internal control as “a process effected by an entity’s board of directors, management and 145  other personnel designed to provide reasonable assurance of the achievement of 146  objectives.” [COSOERM] These internal controls are an important factor at the enterprise 147  level. In fact, the title of OMB Circular A-123 is “Management’s Responsibility for 148  Enterprise Risk Management and Internal Control.” 149  • Risk management controls represent the safeguards or countermeasures prescribed for 150  an information system or an organization to protect ICT in line with mission and business 151  objectives. These controls provide the management, administrative, and technical 152  methods for responding to ICT risks by deterring, detecting, preventing, or correcting 153  threats and vulnerabilities. 154  Note to Reviewers 155  The authors are grateful for the feedback and support provided by the community in response to 156  draft publications. In support of the final edition of this report, NIST asks that readers review the 157  following questions and consider these in your feedback and recommendations. 158  1. Is the treatment of discipline-specific risks (cybersecurity, privacy, supply chain, 159  communications, etc.) clearly expressed in context and relationship to categorization of 160  ICT, operational, and enterprise risk? 161  2. Has the consideration/treatment of risk associated with the intricacies and complexities of 162  interconnectivity, as part of the broader enterprise risk portfolio, been appropriately 163  addressed? Would examples/use-cases depicting this notion further, in the form of 164  supplemental material, be useful? 165  3. Are risk appetite and risk tolerance clearly explained and example use demonstrated? 166  4. Should BIA (business impact analysis) be addressed in this document or as a separate 167  Special Publication? 168  5. Does this publication effectively relate to both private and public sector enterprises 169  through its structure, terminologies, and examples? 170  6. Has this publication provided a clear definition and understanding of positive risk? 171  NIST SP 800-221 ipd ENTERPRISE IMPACT OF INFORMATION  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  AND COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY RISK  iv  7. Does the information outlined in this publication provide sufficient information to inform 172  any mandatory/required disclosures (e.g., U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission 173  [SEC], Internal Revenue Service [IRS])? 174  8. Does this publication provide sufficient information to enable the allocation tradeoffs of 175  an organization’s operating expenses (OpEx) and capital expenditures (CapEx) for ICT 176  risk and issues? 177  9. Does this publication provide actionable guidance to identify, measure, and manage the 178  new dimension of risk inherent in ICT “systems-of-systems”? 179  10. Are there additional ICTRM/ERM-related topics that would be helpful to include in 180  future iterations of this publication? 181  Call for Patent Claims 182  This public review includes a call for information on essential patent claims (claims whose use 183  would be required for compliance with the guidance or requirements in this Information 184  Technology Laboratory (ITL) draft publication). Such guidance and/or requirements may be 185  directly stated in this ITL Publication or by reference to another publication. This call also 186  includes disclosure, where known, of the existence of pending U.S. or foreign patent applications 187  relating to this ITL draft publication and of any relevant unexpired U.S. or foreign patents. 188  ITL may require from the patent holder, or a party authorized to make assurances on its behalf, 189  in written or electronic form, either: 190  a) assurance in the form of a general disclaimer to the effect that such party does not hold 191  and does not currently intend holding any essential patent claim(s); or 192  b) assurance that a license to such essential patent claim(s) will be made available to 193  applicants desiring to utilize the license for the purpose of complying with the guidance 194  or requirements in this ITL draft publication either: 195  i. under reasonable terms and conditions that are demonstrably free of any unfair 196  discrimination; or 197  ii. without compensation and under reasonable terms and conditions that are 198  demonstrably free of any unfair discrimination. 199  Such assurance shall indicate that the patent holder (or third-party authorized to make assurances 200  on its behalf) will include in any documents transferring ownership of patents subject to the 201  assurance, provisions sufficient to ensure that the commitments in the assurance are binding on 202  the transferee, and that the transferee will similarly include appropriate provisions in the event of 203  future transfers with the goal of binding each successor-in-interest. 204  The assurance shall also indicate that it is intended to be binding on successors-in-interest 205  regardless of whether such provisions are included in the relevant transfer documents. 206  Such statements should be addressed to: ictrm@nist.gov 207  mailto:ictrm@nist.gov?subject=SP%20800-221%20Patent%20Comments  NIST SP 800-221 ipd ENTERPRISE IMPACT OF INFORMATION  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  AND COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY RISK  v  Executive Summary 208  All types of organizations, from corporations to federal agencies, face a broad array of risks. For 209  federal agencies, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-11 defines risk as 210  “the effect of uncertainty on objectives” [OMB-A11]. The effect of uncertainty on enterprise 211  mission and business objectives may then be considered as an “enterprise risk” that must be 212  similarly managed. An enterprise is an organization that exists at the top level of a hierarchy 213  with unique risk management responsibilities. Managing risks at that level—enterprise risk 214  management (ERM)—calls for understanding the core risks that an enterprise faces, determining 215  how best to address those risks, and ensuring that the necessary actions are taken. In the Federal 216  Government, ERM is considered “an effective agency-wide approach to addressing the full 217  spectrum of the organization’s significant risks by understanding the combined impact of risks as 218  an interrelated portfolio rather than addressing risks only within silos” [OMB-A11]. OMB 219  Circular A-123 “establishes an expectation for federal agencies to proactively consider and 220  address risks through an integrated…view of events, conditions, or scenarios that impact mission 221  achievement” [OMB-A123]. 222  The information and communications technology (ICT) on which an enterprise relies is managed 223  through a broad set of risk disciplines. For more than 50 years, NIST publications have provided 224  important guidance for individual programs such as manufacturing excellence, privacy, supply 225  chain, and cybersecurity. But, as the OMB quotes above point out, enterprise risk considerations 226  and decisions must take a portfolio perspective. Individual risk programs have an important role 227  and must integrate activities as part of that enterprise portfolio. Doing so ensures a focus on 228  achieving enterprise objectives and helps identify those risks that will have the most significant 229  impact on the entity’s mission. This publication extends that NIST risk program guidance, 230  recognizing that risk extends beyond the boundaries of individual programs. ICT risk 231  considerations and disciplines (e.g., Internet of Things, supply chain, privacy, cybersecurity) as 232  well as risk management frameworks (e.g., those for artificial intelligence and for information 233  systems and organizations) support the management of a mosaic of interrelated risks. Effectively 234  addressing these ICT risks at the enterprise level requires coordination, communication, and 235  collaboration. This publication examines the relationships among ICT risk disciplines and 236  enterprise risk practices. 237  The broad set of ICT disciplines forms an adaptive system-of-systems composed of many 238  interdependent components and channels. The resulting data represents information, control 239  signals, and sensor readings. As with other complex systems-of-systems, the interconnectedness 240  of these technologies produces system behaviors that cannot be determined by the behavior of 241  individual components. That interconnectedness causes risks which exist between risk programs 242  and across multiple risk programs. As our systems become more complex, they present 243  exploitable vulnerabilities, emergent risks, and system instabilities that, once triggered, can have 244  a runaway effect with multiple severe, often irreversible consequences. In the contemporary 245  enterprise, emergency and real-time circumstances can turn a relatively minor ICT-based risk 246  into true operational risks that disrupt an organization’s ability to perform mission or business 247  functions.  248  This publication supports an interconnected approach to risk frameworks and programs that 249  addresses ICT risk as a special subset of enterprise risk. This publication encourages the practice 250  NIST SP 800-221 ipd ENTERPRISE IMPACT OF INFORMATION  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  AND COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY RISK  vi  of aggregating and normalizing ICT risk information, helping to identify, quantify, and 251  communicate risk scenarios and their consequences. Doing so supports effective decision-252  making. That integrated approach ensures that shareholder and stakeholder value is quantified in 253  financial, mission, and reputation metrics similar to those attributed to other (non-technical) 254  enterprise risks, enabling executives and officials to prudently reallocate resources among all the 255  varied competing risk types. 256  While NIST is widely recognized as a source of cybersecurity guidance, cyber is only one 257  portion of a large and complex set of uncertainties including financial, legal, legislative, safety, 258  and strategic risks. As part of an ERM program, senior leaders (e.g., corporate officers, 259  government senior executive staff) often have fiduciary and reporting responsibilities that other 260  organizational stakeholders do not, so 261  they have a unique responsibility to 262  holistically manage the combined set of 263  risks. ERM provides the umbrella under 264  which risks are aggregated and 265  prioritized so that all risks can be 266  evaluated and “stovepiped” risk 267  reporting can be avoided. ERM also 268  provides an opportunity for 269  identification of operational risk, a 270  subset of the enterprise risks so 271  significant that potential losses could 272  jeopardize one or more aspects of 273  operations. Risk managers will 274  determine whether a failed internal 275  process (related to enterprise people, 276  processes, technology, or governance) 277  will directly cause a significant 278  operational impact. Some risk response 279  activities are there to directly protect 280  mission operations. Enterprise leaders 281  should define these operational risk 282  parameters as part of enterprise risk 283  strategy. 284  This publication explores the high-level 285  ICT risk management (ICTRM) process 286  illustrated by Figure 1. Many resources 287  – such as well-known frameworks from 288  the Committee of Sponsoring 289  Organizations (COSO), OMB circulars, 290  and the International Organization for 291  Standardization (ISO) – document 292  ERM frameworks and processes. They 293  generally include similar approaches: 294  identify context, identify risks, analyze 295  Figure 1: ICTRM Integration Cycle  NIST SP 800-221 ipd ENTERPRISE IMPACT OF INFORMATION  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  AND COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY RISK  vii  risk, estimate risk importance, determine and execute the risk response, and identify and respond 296  to changes over time. The process recognizes that no risk response should occur without 297  understanding stakeholder expectations for managing risk to an acceptable level, as informed by 298  leadership’s risk appetite and risk tolerance statements. 299  To ensure that leaders can be provided a composite understanding of the various threats and 300  consequences facing each organization and enterprise, risk information is recorded and shared 301  through risk registers.1 At higher levels in the enterprise structure, various risk registers 302  (including those related to ICTRM) are aggregated, normalized, and prioritized into risk profiles. 303  While it is critical that enterprises address potential negative impacts on mission and business 304  objectives, it is equally critical (and required for federal agencies) that enterprises plan for 305  success. OMB states that “the [Enterprise Risk] profile must identify sources of uncertainty, both 306  positive (opportunities) and negative (threats).” [OMB-A123] Enterprise-level decision makers 307  use the risk profile to choose which enterprise risks to address, allocate resources, and delegate 308  responsibilities to appropriate risk owners. ERM strategy includes defining terminology, formats, 309  criteria, and other guidance for risk inputs from lower levels of the enterprise. 310  Integrated risk management information from throughout the enterprise helps create a composite 311  enterprise risk register (ERR) and a prioritized enterprise risk profile (ERP) to inform company 312  executives and agency officials’ ERM deliberations, decisions, and actions. It describes the 313  inclusion of ICT risks (including various operational technology, supply chain, privacy, and 314  cybersecurity risks) as part of financial, valuation, mission, and reputation exposure. A 315  comprehensive ERR and ERP support communication and disclosure requirements. The 316  integration of technology-specific risk management activities supports an understanding of 317  exposures related to corporate reporting (e.g., income statements, balance sheets, cash flow) and 318  similar requirements (e.g., reporting for appropriation and oversight authorities) for public-sector 319  entities. The iterative ICTRM process enables adjustments to risk direction. As leaders receive 320  feedback regarding enterprise progress, strategy can be adjusted to take advantage of an 321  opportunity or to better address negative risk as information is collected and shared. 322  Application of a consistent approach to identify, assess, respond to, and communicate risk 323  throughout the enterprise about the entire portfolio of ICT risk disciplines will help ensure that 324  leaders and executives are always informed and able to support effective strategic and tactical 325  decisions. While the methods for managing risk among different disciplines will vary widely, an 326  ICT-wide approach to directing that risk management, reporting and monitoring the results, and 327  adjusting to optimize achievement of enterprise objectives will provide valuable benefits.  328  1  OMB Circular A-11 defines a risk register as “a repository of risk information including the data understood about risks  over time” [OMB-A11].

COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY RISK  1  1 Introduction 421  The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) defines risk as “the effect of uncertainty on 422  objectives” [OMB-A11]. The effect of uncertainty on enterprise mission and business objectives 423  may then be considered an enterprise risk that must be similarly managed. The process of 424  managing risks at the enterprise level is known as enterprise risk management (ERM), and it 425  calls for: 426  • identifying and understanding the core risks facing an enterprise, 427  • determining how best to address those risks, and 428  • ensuring that the necessary actions are taken. 429  Playbook: Enterprise Risk Management for the U.S. Federal Government [ERMPLAYBOOK] 430  defines numerous types of risk, including compliance, financial, information and 431  communications technology (ICT), legal, legislative, operational, reputational, and strategic.2 432  Enterprises use ERM to holistically manage the combined set of risks. OMB Circular A-123 433  “establishes an expectation for federal agencies to proactively consider and address risks through 434  an integrated…view of events, conditions, or scenarios that impact mission achievement” 435  [OMB-A123]. OMB considers ERM to be “an effective agency-wide approach to addressing the 436  full spectrum of the organization’s significant risks by understanding the combined impact of 437  risks as an interrelated portfolio, rather than addressing risks only within silos.” [OMB-A123] In 438  the private sector, the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations (COSO) publication, Enterprise 439  Risk Management – Integrating with Strategy and Performance, defines ERM as the “culture, 440  capabilities, and practices that organizations integrate with strategy-setting and apply when they 441  carry out that strategy, with a purpose of managing risk in creating, preserving, and realizing 442  value.” [COSOERM] 443  Many ICT risk management (ICTRM) disciplines, including cybersecurity, supply chain, and 444  privacy, have evolved into full-fledged risk programs because of organizations’ reliance on ICT. 445  The rapid evolution of ICTRM disciplines sometimes has led to miscommunication and 446  inefficiencies between those risk programs and the overarching ERM portfolio of risks. In recent 447  years, NIST has published guidance to codify risk management practices for several individual 448  ICT risk programs, such as general cybersecurity (Cybersecurity Framework), general privacy 449  (Privacy Framework), information system and organization cybersecurity and privacy (Risk 450  Management Framework), artificial intelligence (AI Risk Management Framework), Internet of 451  Things (IoT) cybersecurity, and cyber supply chain risk management.  452  1.1 Purpose and Scope 453  This publication broadens NIST’s existing ICT risk guidance by recognizing and incorporating 454  ICTRM within the overall sphere of ERM. All ICT risk programs can work together to support 455  ERM and can be integrated into risk portfolios for ERM. Comparing the outputs of ICTRM 456  2  While an updated ERM Playbook has been drafted, that publication has not been publicly distributed. Special Publication  (SP) 800-221 draws from the original (2016) edition of that guide but remains consistent with the updated edition.  NIST SP 800-221 ipd ENTERPRISE IMPACT OF INFORMATION  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  AND COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY RISK  2  activities with effective inputs to ERM activities, and the outputs of ERM with effective inputs 457  for ICTRM, enables stakeholders to identify opportunities to close gaps. 458  This document is intended to help improve communication (including risk information sharing) 459  between and among ICT professionals and system owners, high-level executives, and corporate 460  officers at multiple levels. The goal is to assist personnel in better identifying, assessing, and 461  managing ICT risks in the context of their broader mission and business objectives. This 462  document will help professionals understand what executives and corporate officers need for 463  them to carry out ERM. This includes what data to collect, what analyses to perform, and how to 464  consolidate and condition this discipline-specific risk information. This document will also help 465  executives and officers to understand the challenges that ICT professionals face. 466  This document references some materials that are specifically intended for use by federal 467  agencies, but the concepts and approaches are intended to be useful for all enterprises. 468  Other NIST resources supporting this document include the following: 469  • NIST Special Publication (SP) 800-221A, Information and Communications Technology 470  (ICT) Risk Outcomes: Integrating ICT Risk Management Programs with the Enterprise 471  Risk Portfolio [SP800221A] provides a framework of outcomes that applies to all types 472  of ICT risk. It complements the content of this document. The outcomes defined in SP 473  800-221A are also available in spreadsheet format from the NIST Cybersecurity and 474  Privacy Reference Tool (CPRT) website.3 475  • An informative reference that links the contents of SP 800-221A with the NIST 476  Cybersecurity Framework is posted as part of the National Online Informative 477  References (OLIR) Program.4 478  • The NIST Interagency or Internal Report (IR) 8286 [IR8286] series of publications 479  describe an example implementation of the ICTRM process. They illustrate integrated 480  risk identification, assessment, monitoring, and reporting through cybersecurity examples 481  and describe processes that are analogous for many types of ICT risk. 482  1.2 Document Structure 483  The remainder of this document is organized into the following major sections: 484  • Section 2 provides a brief introduction to ICTRM and explores common challenges 485  involved in integrating ICTRM with ERM processes.  486  • Section 3 discusses ICT risk considerations throughout the ERM process in detail, 487  highlighting the use of the risk register to document ICT risk as ERM input. 488  • Section 4 examines how ICT risk registers can be used for adopting a portfolio view of 489  risk at the enterprise level based on normalizing and aggregating ICT risk registers into 490  an enterprise risk register, then applying prioritization to it to generate an enterprise risk 491  profile to support senior executive decision-making during boardroom deliberations. 492  3  See the Cybersecurity and Privacy Reference Tool (CPRT) website for more details.  4  See NIST Online Informative Reference Program (OLIR) for more details.  https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/cprt https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/olir  NIST SP 800-221 ipd ENTERPRISE IMPACT OF INFORMATION  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  AND COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY RISK  3  • Section 5 explores enterprise strategy for ICT risk coordination.

Although they are often used 504  interchangeably,5 for the purposes of this document an organization is an entity of any size, 505  complexity, or position within a larger organizational structure (e.g., a federal agency or 506  company), and an enterprise is an organization at the top level of the hierarchy. Figure 2 shows a 507  notional enterprise with subordinate organizations, illustrating that one of those subordinates is 508  itself an enterprise. Both government and industry are represented in this depiction.  509  Consider the example of 510  the Department of 511  Commerce as a higher-512  level enterprise with 513  bureaus (e.g., Census 514  Bureau, National Oceanic 515  and Atmospheric 516  Administration [NOAA], 517  NIST) as lower-level 518  enterprises and their 519  subordinates (e.g., 520  NOAA’s National 521  Weather Service, NIST 522  laboratories) representing 523  organizations. In 524  industry, consider mergers and 525  acquisitions where an enterprise acquires another company, which itself was an enterprise, and 526  then subordinates it within the higher-level enterprise’s conglomeration of organizations and 527  systems. Each enterprise is supported by various systems, each a discrete set of information 528  resources organized expressly for the collection, processing, maintenance, use, sharing, 529  dissemination, or disposition of information. 530  Most ICTRM responsibilities tend to be carried out by the individual organizations within an 531  enterprise. In contrast, the ERM responsibility for tracking key enterprise risks and their impacts 532  on objectives is at the highest-level enterprise, held by top-level corporate officers and board 533  members who have fiduciary and reporting duties not performed elsewhere in the enterprise. 534  ERM requires identifying and understanding the various types of risk, including ICT risks, that 535  an enterprise faces; determining the probability that these risks will occur; and estimating their 536  5  For example, NIST IR 8170 uses enterprise risk management and organization-wide risk management interchangeably. The  scope of NIST IR 8170 includes smaller enterprises than this publication does, so an enterprise as defined there may be  comprised of a single organization. The enterprises discussed in this publication have more complex compositions. [IR8170]  Figure 2: Enterprise Hierarchy  NIST SP 800-221 ipd ENTERPRISE IMPACT OF INFORMATION  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  AND COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY RISK  5  potential impact. ERM processes provide senior enterprise executives with a portfolio view of 537  key risks across the enterprise, and this portfolio considers the outputs of all ICTRM disciplines.6  538  Public and private enterprises have a common primary purpose for ERM: to safeguard the 539  enterprise’s mission, finances (e.g., net revenue, capital, free cash flow), and reputation (e.g., 540  stakeholder trust) in the face of natural, accidental, and adversarial threats.  541  2.2 ICTRM Life Cycle 542  There are many models for risk management processes. Table 1 illustrates similarities among 543  several common risk management models, including establishing context, identifying risks, 544  analyzing risks, estimating risk importance, determining and executing risk response, and 545  monitoring and responding to changes over time. The entries in Table 1 indicate (in parentheses) 546  their identifier or section number from the source material whenever available. Table 1 provides 547  a high-level comparison and is not intended as a crosswalk for relationships among the models, 548  but instead to show that risk management disciplines that aggregate into the ERM process follow 549  similar steps to manage risk. 550  The resources in Table 1 are from the ERM Playbook [ERMPLAYBOOK], the COSO ERM 551  Framework [COSOERM], International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 31000 552  [ISO31000], OMB Circular A-123 [OMB-A123], and the U.S. Government Accountability 553  Office (GAO) Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government [GREENBOOK]. 554  Table 1: Similarities Among Selected ERM and Risk Management Documents 555  ERM Playbook COSO ERM Framework ISO 31000:2018 OMB A-123 GAO Green Book  Identify the Context  • Governance and  Culture  • Strategy and  Objective Setting  Establish External Context  (5.3.2), Establish Internal  Context (5.3.3)  Establish Context  Define objectives  and risk tolerances  (6.01)  Identify the Risks  • Performance  • Review and Revision  • Information,  Communication and  Reporting  Risk  Assessment  Risk  Identification  (5.4.2)  Identify Risks Identification of  Risks (7.02)  Analyze the Risks  Risk  Analysis  (5.4.3)  Analyze and  Evaluate  Analysis of Risks  (7.05)  Assess Likelihood  Calculate  Level of  Risk  Management  estimates the  significance of a risk  and considers the  magnitude of impact,  the likelihood of  occurrence, and the  nature of the risk  Assess Impact  Prioritize Risks  Calculate Exposure  Plan and Execute  Response Strategies  Risk  Evaluation  (5.4.4)  Develop  Alternatives Response to Risks  (7.08)  Risk Treatment (5.5) Respond to Risks  6  This is defined by OMB as “insight into all areas of organizational exposure to risk […] thus increasing an Agency’s  chances of experiencing fewer unanticipated outcomes and executing a better assessment of risk associated with changes in  the environment” [OMB-A123].

This is not meant to imply that all enterprises should use these particular steps; enterprises 558  should determine and apply the appropriate approach to achieve ICTRM/ERM integration, 559  communication, and monitoring. The six steps in the notional ICTRM life cycle are: 560  • Step 1. Identify the context. Context is the external and internal environment in which 561  the enterprise operates and is influenced by the risks involved. This step includes 562  determining and documenting the enterprise mission, including goals and objectives, and 563  the enterprise risk management strategy. This step also includes enterprise leaders 564  communicating risk management expectations to their component organizations. 565  • Step 2. Identify the risks. This means identifying the comprehensive set of positive and 566  negative risks and determining which events could enhance or impede objectives, 567  including the risk of failing to pursue an opportunity.  568  • Step 3. Analyze the risks. This involves estimating the likelihood that each identified 569  risk event will occur and the potential impact of the consequences described. 570  • Step 4. Prioritize the risks. The exposure is calculated for each risk based on likelihood 571  and potential impact, and the risks are then prioritized based on their exposure. 572  • Step 5. Plan and execute risk response strategies. The appropriate response is 573  determined for each risk and informed by risk guidance from leadership. 574  • Step 6. Monitor, evaluate, and adjust risk management. Continual monitoring ensures 575  that enterprise risk conditions remain within the defined risk appetite levels as risks 576  change.  577  Steps 2 through 6 usually utilize risk registers. OMB Circular A-11 describes a risk register as “a 578  repository of risk information, including the data understood about risks over time.” It also 579  states, “Typically, a risk register contains a description of the risk, the impact if the risk should 580  occur, the probability of its occurrence, mitigation strategies, risk owners, and a ranking to 581  identify higher priority risks.” [OMB-A11] Each register evolves and matures as other risk 582  activities take place. 583  Not all risk management methodologies generate an artifact called a risk register or risk log. 584  However, the output of each methodology contains the underpinnings of (or can serve as an input 585  to) a risk register. Because they can be useful information-gathering constructs, organizations not 586  yet familiar with or using risk registers are strongly urged to adopt and integrate them into 587  whatever risk management methodology they are currently using. Risk registers represent an 588  organizing principle for communicating ICT risks to the OMB Circular A-123 ERM process for 589  NIST SP 800-221 ipd ENTERPRISE IMPACT OF INFORMATION  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  AND COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY RISK  7  organizations already familiar with this 590  management construct. Documenting 591  and tracking ICT risks in risk registers 592  provides a common organizing method 593  and fosters communication from ICT 594  risk disciplines to senior decision 595  makers.  596  Figure 3 depicts a notional ICTRM life 597  cycle with numbers to indicate where 598  each step occurs. Section 3 provides 599  more detail about each step and all the 600  elements within Figure 3. 601  2.3 ICTRM and ERM Integration 602  ERM and ICTRM have several points of 603  integration. First, enterprise governance 604  activities for ERM direct the strategy 605  and methods for ICTRM and other risk 606  management disciplines to use. Based 607  on this guidance, each discipline within 608  each organization uses risk registers to 609  document its risks – in the case of 610  ICTRM, risks derived from system-level 611  assessments. Next, these risk registers 612  are aggregated and normalized, then 613  used to create enterprise-level risk 614  registers for each discipline. These, in 615  turn, become part of a broader 616  enterprise risk register (ERR) that 617  encompasses all disciplines.  618  Figure 4 demonstrates that ERM and ICTRM are not separate processes; ICTRM represents an 619  important subset of the broader portfolio of ERM. Documenting and tracking ICT risks in lower-620  level risk registers supports better management of ICT risks at the enterprise level.  621  The ERR is prioritized by those with fiduciary and oversight responsibilities, creating an 622  enterprise risk profile (ERP), also known as an ERM risk profile.7 An ERP is created by 623  considering enterprise risks in relation to achieving objectives as typically outlined in an 624  organizational strategic plan. OMB Circular A-123 [OMB-A123] requires ERPs to include four 625  kinds of objectives: strategic, operations (operational effectiveness and efficiency), reporting 626  (reporting reliability), and compliance (compliance with applicable laws and regulations). While 627  there may be some overlap among the categories of objectives, understanding uncertainty as it 628  7  OMB Circular A-123 recommends (and requires for federal users) recording enterprise risks in an enterprise risk profile.  Figure 3: Notional Life Cycle for Integrated ICTRM/ERM  NIST SP 800-221 ipd ENTERPRISE IMPACT OF INFORMATION  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  AND COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY RISK  8  affects these objectives will help inform effective and timely decision-making. Effective ERM 629  balances achieving objectives with optimizing resources. 630  Section 3 discusses ICTRM 631  and ERM integration in 632  much greater detail. 633  2.4 Shortcomings of 634  Typical Approaches 635  to ICTRM 636  Historically, in many 637  enterprises, ICTRM 638  disciplines have not been 639  well integrated with ERM 640  processes. While ICTRM 641  follows many of the same 642  high-level principles as the 643  ERM framework, ICTRM 644  is typically executed quite 645  differently, and its outputs 646  are not always properly 647  conditioned as ERM inputs. 648  Some common contributors 649  to those shortcomings are 650  described below. 651  2.4.1 Increasing System 652  and Ecosystem 653  Complexity 654  Many systems today are 655  complex, adaptive “system-656  of-systems” composed of 657  thousands of 658  interdependent components 659  and myriad channels. The 660  systems operate in a rapidly 661  changing socio-political-662  technological environment 663  that presents threats from individuals and groups with shifting alliances, attitudes, and agendas. 664  The constant introduction of new technologies has changed and complicated cyberspace. 665  Wireless connections, big data, cloud computing, and the IoT present new complexities and 666  concomitant vulnerabilities. Information and technology are no longer like simple, automated 667  filing systems. Rather, they are like the central nervous system – a delicately balanced and 668  intricate part of an organization or enterprise that coordinates and controls the most fundamental 669  assets of most organizations. This ecosystem’s increasing complexity gives rise to systemic risks 670  Figure 4: ICTRM As Part of ERM  NIST SP 800-221 ipd ENTERPRISE IMPACT OF INFORMATION  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  AND COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY RISK  9  and exploitable vulnerabilities that, once triggered, can have a runaway effect with multiple 671  severe consequences for enterprises.  672  Managing ICT risk for these ecosystems is incredibly challenging because of their dynamic 673  complexity. This complexity increases risk to specific systems, and that risk can cascade to 674  create additional risks at the system, organization, and enterprise levels. Emerging risk 675  conditions created by the interdependence of systems and counterparty risk must also be 676  identified, tracked, and managed. 677  2.4.2 Lack of Standardized Measures 678  ICT risk measurement has been extensively researched for decades. As measurement techniques 679  have evolved, the complexity of digital assets has also greatly increased, making the 680  measurement problem more difficult to solve. Some low-level measures8 have been 681  standardized, like the estimated likelihood and impact of a particular vulnerability being 682  exploited. However, for many aspects of ICT risk, there are no standard measures. Without 683  consistent measures, there is little basis for analyzing risk or expressing risk in comparable ways 684  across digital assets and the systems composed of those assets. 685  2.4.3 Informal Analysis Methods 686  Risk analysis for ICT tends to be inconsistent compared to many other forms of risk. Even where 687  guidance is provided, such as in NIST publications, the resulting risk assessment reports from 688  agencies differ significantly. Moreover, foundational inputs for likelihood and impact 689  calculations generally lack a standardized methodology or are at the discretion of vendors who 690  provide a scoring system. Decisions are often made based on an individual’s instinct, experience, 691  and knowledge of conventional wisdom and typical practices. In addition, there is usually little 692  analysis performed after controls are deployed to determine whether risks have been reduced to a 693  level deemed acceptable (i.e., within the established risk tolerance parameters). 694  2.4.4 Overly Focused on the System Level 695  The management of ICT risk is conducted in different ways at various levels, including at the 696  system, organization, and enterprise levels. A common practice is for individual system-level 697  teams to be responsible for tracking relevant risks. While system reporting to the organizational 698  level may occur, there is typically no mechanism in place to consolidate the risk data for systems 699  to the organization level, much less to the enterprise level. When organization or enterprise 700  managers receive system risk data, it is often a vague risk map or at such a volume as to be 701  impractical. Therefore, it is not surprising that higher levels of an organization or enterprise tend 702  to struggle with understanding ICT risk. This struggle may be less pronounced in organizations 703  with an enterprise architecture that maps systems onto the business processes they support. 704  Many enterprise risks are interdependent. A common industry example is that while 705  cybersecurity, privacy, and credit risks are different elements of the ERM portfolio, it is quite 706  8  NIST typically uses the term “measures” instead of “metrics.” For more information on the distinction, see  https://www.nist.gov/itl/ssd/software-quality-group/metrics-and-measures.  https://www.nist.gov/itl/ssd/software-quality-group/metrics-and-measures  NIST SP 800-221 ipd ENTERPRISE IMPACT OF INFORMATION  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  AND COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY RISK  10  possible that a cybersecurity breach of personally identifiable information might result in a credit 707  downgrade or a loss of public confidence. These interdependencies make it important that 708  enterprise managers collaborate, communicate, and recognize that information, technology, and 709  business risks are not isolated issues. 710  2.4.5 The Gap Between ICTRM Output and ERM Input 711  An enterprise that seeks to avoid all ICT risk might stifle innovation or efficiencies to the point 712  where little value would be produced. At the other end of the spectrum, an enterprise that applies 713  technology without regard to actual risk increases the chances that it might fall victim to 714  undesirable consequences. Effectively balancing the benefits of technology with the potential 715  risks and consequences of a threat event is more likely to result in effective ICTRM that supports 716  a comprehensive ERM approach. Enterprises, organizations, and practitioners should consider 717  the influence of risks on achieving enterprise strategic, operations, reporting, and compliance 718  objectives. Enterprise risk officers should clearly communicate these enterprise objectives so that 719  practitioners can take actions and provide relevant risk inputs to ERM programs. They also need 720  to consider relevant policy decisions and regulatory impacts. 721  For ERM purposes, there should be a process for integrating the risk registers of various ICTRM 722  disciplines. This allows for the easy exchange of risk knowledge between ICTRM and ERM 723  participants. Many organizations do not conduct these activities in consistent, repeatable ways. 724  Quantifying and aggregating ICT risks are often done in an ad hoc fashion and are not performed 725  with the rigor used for other types of risk. This lowers the quality of ICT risk information 726  provided to ERM. 727  2.4.6 Losing the Context of the Positive Risk 728  As aggravated by the multi-level nature of risk management, sometimes risks identified and 729  managed at the system and organizational levels lose the context of associated positive risks.  730  The basic rationalization for addressing negative risks with resources, time, and funding is that 731  positive risks warrant those investments. Only by evaluating the value of positive risks alongside 732  the expense of negative risks can we understand whether continued pursuit of positive risks and 733  investment in negative risks is “worth it.” Losing track of positive risks can result in over-734  investing in the corresponding negative risks. 735  NIST SP 800-221 ipd ENTERPRISE IMPACT OF INFORMATION  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  AND COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY RISK  11  3 ICT Risk Considerations  736  This section discusses ICT risk considerations, with the content structured according to the six 737  steps in the notional ICTRM life cycle described in Figure 3: 738  1. Identify the context.  739  2. Identify the risks.  740  3. Analyze (quantify) the risks.  741  4. Prioritize the risks.  742  5. Plan and execute risk response strategies.  743  6. Monitor, evaluate, and adjust risk management. 744  Following those, Section 3.7 briefly discusses considerations for positive risks.  745  3.1 Identify the Context 746  In the risk management life cycle, the first step in managing ICT risks is understanding context –747  the environment in which the organization operates and is influenced by the risks involved. The 748  context provides important input into the other risk management life cycle steps by documenting 749  the expectations and drivers to be considered. The risk context includes two factors: 750  • External context involves the expectations of outside stakeholders who affect and are 751  affected by the organization, such as customers, regulators, legislators, and business 752  partners. These stakeholders have objectives, perceptions, and expectations about how 753  risk will be communicated, managed, and monitored. 754  • Internal context relates to many of the factors within the organization and relevant 755  considerations across the enterprise. This includes any internal factors that influence risk 756  management, such as the organization and enterprise’s objectives, governance, culture, 757  risk appetite, risk tolerance, policies, and practices. 758  Several NIST frameworks begin with determining these context factors. NIST Cybersecurity 759  Framework Step 1: Prioritize and Scope states that organizations make strategic decisions 760  regarding ICT implementations and determine the scope of the systems and assets that support 761  the selected business line or process. These context exercises identify the organization mission 762  drivers and priorities used for subsequent assessment and planning. 763  3.1.1 Risk Governance  764  As an important component of ERM, ICTRM helps assure that ICT risks do not hinder 765  accomplishment of established enterprise mission objectives. ICTRM also helps ensure that 766  exposure from ICT risk remains within the limits assigned by enterprise leadership. The method 767  for connecting enterprise operations and communications to strategy is governance. Governance 768  represents the methods for evaluating strategic options and directing activities to achieve that 769  strategy. Through a governance model, enterprise objectives are determined, providing direction 770  for prioritization and decision-making. Governance is often described as distinct from 771  management in the same way that a directive from a ship’s captain is distinct from the many 772  NIST SP 800-221 ipd ENTERPRISE IMPACT OF INFORMATION  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  AND COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY RISK  12  activities performed to fulfill the directive. Similarly, risk governance is the process by which 773  risk management evaluation, decisions, and actions are connected to enterprise strategy and 774  objectives. 775  Risk governance provides the transparency, responsibility, and accountability that enables 776  managers to acceptably manage risk. In this regard, there can be multiple participants in the 777  governance process, depending on context and enterprise type. Larger entities might implement 778  risk governance mechanisms across the enterprise with more specific governance mechanisms at 779  the organization (e.g., division, portfolio, or bureau) and apply that strategy to systems or 780  programs. 781  Table 2 illustrates some notional roles and responsibilities at each level. 782  Table 2: Examples of Risk Oversight Roles and Responsibilities 783  Risk  Functions  Notional  Private-Sector  Roles  Notional Federal  Government Roles  Notional  Responsibilities  Enterprise- Level  Oversight  Board of  Directors,  Regulators, Chief  Executive  Officer, Chief  Operating Officer  OMB, U.S.  Congressional  Oversight  Committees, Head of  Agency  Ensures alignment with strategic priorities;  monitors and corrects misalignments; holds  management accountable for performance;  receives periodic progress reports.

Aggregates and  normalizes risks for comparison at the enterprise  level in consultation with risk owners.  Determines enterprise risk threshold (risk appetite  and tolerance) for high-priority risks in consultation  with business leads and ensures that it is  communicated and known by the appropriate staff.  9  In the U.S. Federal Government, the Chief Financial Officer may be given purview over ERM functions due to the  partnership of those functions with internal controls per OMB Circular A-123. In some agencies, the Chief Operating  Officer leads these functions to achieve an integrated view of all types of risk.

Ensures that risks are being monitored, that the  status is periodically reported to the CISO, and that  risk response decisions are communicated back to  the risk owner.  As shown in the table, certain enterprise and organization risk governance functions may be 784  delegated to other senior leaders. Individual risk programs – including cybersecurity, privacy, 785  and cyber supply chain risk management (C-SCRM) – might then further translate enterprise risk 786  direction (e.g., risk appetite statements) into program-specific risk direction, enabling holistic 787  risk processes while supporting system owners’ decision authority. The division of responsibility 788  is typical in larger organizations where an officer is specifically assigned to be responsible for 789  program governance (e.g., chief information security officer, chief privacy officer). 790  3.1.2 Risk Appetite and Risk Tolerance 791  This document draws on ERM principles regarding integration with culture, strategy, and 792  performance. One such principle is that an “organization must manage risk to strategy and 793  business objectives in relation to its risk appetite – that is, the types and amount of risk, on a 794  broad level, it is willing to accept in its pursuit of value.” [COSOERM] OMB adapted this 795  language for government use in Circular A-123 by similarly stating that risk appetite “is the 796  broad-based amount of risk an organization is willing to accept in pursuit of its mission/vision” 797  [OMB-A123]. Risk appetite is defined by the enterprise’s senior-level leadership as part of risk 798  governance. Risk appetite serves as the guidepost for the types and amount of risk, on a broad 799  level, that senior leaders are willing to accept in pursuit of mission objectives and enterprise 800  value.10 Risk appetite may be qualitative or quantitative.  801  Another important ERM concept is risk tolerance – the organization’s or stakeholders’ readiness 802  to bear the remaining risk after responding to or considering the risk in order to achieve its 803  objectives (while recognizing that such tolerance can be influenced by legal or regulatory 804  10  OMB Circular A-123 defines risk appetite as “the broad-based amount of risk an organization is willing to accept in pursuit  of its mission/vision. It is established by the organization’s most senior level leadership and serves as the guidepost to set  strategy and select objectives.”  NIST SP 800-221 ipd ENTERPRISE IMPACT OF INFORMATION  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  AND COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY RISK  14  requirements). In Circular A-123, OMB again adapted the COSO language [COSOERM] by 805  stating that risk tolerance “is the acceptable level of variance in performance relative to the 806  achievement of objectives.” Risk tolerance can be defined at the enterprise level, but OMB 807  Circular A-123 offers a bit of discretion to organizations, stating that risk tolerance is “generally 808  established at the program, objective, or component level,” which this publication references as 809  the “organization level.” 810  While risk appetite is defined at the enterprise level and risk tolerance at the enterprise or 811  organization level, risk appetite is interpreted at the organizational and system levels to develop 812  specific ICT risk tolerance. Risk tolerance represents the specific level of performance risk 813  deemed acceptable within the risk appetite set by senior leadership (while recognizing that such 814  tolerance can be influenced by legal or regulatory requirements).11 Risk tolerance is interpreted 815  and applied by the receiving custodians of the risk management discipline (e.g., cybersecurity, 816  financial, legal, privacy) at the organization or system level.  817  Risk appetite and risk tolerance are related but distinct in a similar manner to the relationship 818  between governance and management activities. Risk appetite statements define the overarching 819  risk guidance, and risk tolerance statements define the specific application of that direction. This 820  means that risk tolerance statements are always more specific than the corresponding risk 821  appetite statements. Together, risk appetite and risk tolerance statements represent risk limits, 822  help communicate risk expectations, and improve the focus of risk management efforts. They 823  also help to address other factors, such as findings from internal audits or external reports. The 824  definition of these risk parameters places the enterprise in a better position to identify, prioritize, 825  treat, and monitor risks that may lead to unacceptable loss. Risk tolerance should always stay 826  within the boundaries established by senior leadership, within the parameters of and informed by 827  legal and regulatory requirements. 828  An example of a statement of risk appetite is: “Email service shall be available during the large 829  majority of a 24-hour period.” An associated risk tolerance statement for this appetite would be 830  narrower: “Email services shall not be interrupted more than five minutes during core hours.” 831  Table 3 provides additional examples of actionable, measurable risk tolerance, illustrating the 832  application of risk appetite to specific contexts within the organization-level structure. Several 833  NIST documents, including the NIST IR 8286 series and Cyber Supply Chain Risk Management 834  Practices for Systems and Organizations, NIST SP 800-161, Revision 1, also provide detailed 835  examples of risk appetite and risk tolerance statements and how they are interpreted and applied 836  with the associated risk defined, managed, and communicated back to executive management via 837  the risk register [SP800161]. 838  11  OMB Circular A-123 states, “Risk must be analyzed in relation to achievement of the strategic objectives established in the  Agency strategic plan (see OMB Circular No. A-11, Section 230), as well as risk in relation to appropriate operational  objectives. Specific objectives must be identified and documented to facilitate identification of risks to strategic, operations,  reporting, and compliance” [OMB-A123].

Internet Service  Provider  The company has a low risk appetite with  regard to failure to meet customer service  level agreements, including network  availability and communication speeds.  Patches must be applied to avoid attack-related  outages but must also be well-tested and  deployed in a manner that does not reduce  availability below agreed-upon service levels.  Academic  Institution  The institution understands that mobile  computers are a necessary part of the  daily life of students, and some loss is  expected. The leadership, however, has  no appetite for the loss of any sensitive  data (as defined by the Data Classification  Policy).  Because the cost of loss prevention for  students’ laptops is likely to exceed the cost of  the devices, it is acceptable for up to 10 percent  to be misplaced or stolen if and only if sensitive  institution information is prohibited from being  stored on students’ devices.  Healthcare  Provider  The Board of Directors has decided that  the enterprise has a low risk appetite for  any exposures caused by inadequate  access control or authentication  processes.  There will always be some devices that do not  yet support advanced authentication, but  100 percent of critical healthcare business  applications must use multi-factor  authentication.  3.1.3 Risk Management Strategy 840  As part of their governance responsibilities, senior enterprise executives should establish clear 841  and actionable risk management guidance based on enterprise mission and business objectives to 842  the organizations within their purview. This should include an enterprise strategy regarding 843  mission priority, risk appetite and tolerance (typically in the form of risk appetite and risk 844  tolerance statements), and capital and operating budgets to manage risks to an acceptable level. 845  Organizations then manage and monitor processes that properly balance risks and resource 846  allocation with the value created by ICT. Measurements (e.g., from key risk indicators, or KRIs) 847  demonstrate where risk tolerances have been exceeded or validate that the enterprise is operating 848  within the defined appetite.  849  As the risk landscape evolves (e.g., due to technological or environmental changes), enterprise 850  leaders should continually review and adjust the risk strategy. For example, an enterprise subject 851  to outside regulation is likely to receive specific guidance regarding updated federal statutes and 852  directives that must be considered when evaluating acceptable risk. 853  Differing assumptions may occur at all levels of the organization, so it is important to determine 854  internal and external stakeholders’ expectations regarding risk communications and to use 855  readily understandable and agreed-upon terms and categories, such as strategic objectives, 856  organizational priorities, decision-making processes, and risk reporting or tracking 857  methodologies (e.g., regular risk management committee discussions and meetings). It is also 858  critical that enterprise leaders provide guidance regarding risk calculations. Establishing a 859  NIST SP 800-221 ipd ENTERPRISE IMPACT OF INFORMATION  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  AND COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY RISK  16  common scale for assessing levels of risk will support consistent risk estimation, measurement, 860  and reporting. The strategy may also include guidance regarding the mechanisms and frequency 861  of risk reporting. 862  As risks are recorded, tracked, and reassessed throughout the cycle, this foundation ensures that 863  all agree about how various types of risk will be communicated and managed to ensure 864  adherence to risk guidance and expectations. 865  Risk management strategy is similar for both public- and private-sector enterprises. For example, 866  public officials and corporate boards typically measure and weigh the impact and likelihood of 867  each type of significant risk (e.g., market, operational, labor, geopolitical, technology, data) to 868  determine their individual and total impacts on the enterprise’s mission, finances, and reputation. 869  The public officials or board members then determine their risk appetite and resource allocations 870  for each type of risk commensurate with likelihood and impact and balanced among all 871  calculated enterprise risk exposures (the product of likelihood and impact). Public officials and 872  board members also provide guidance to their corporate officers at the enterprise level and to 873  high-level executives at the organization level. This includes guidance on ceilings for capital 874  expenditures (CapEx) and operating expenses (OpEx) and objectives for free cash flow. For the 875  Federal Government, similar requirements are expressed through OMB guidance and strategic 876  direction from senior agency officials, chief executives, and other designees (e.g., an ERM 877  Council).  878  For both private- and public-sector entities, leaders issue guidance to continue, accelerate, 879  reduce, delay, or cancel significant enterprise initiatives. They do this while making decisions 880  about what constitutes prudent risk disclosures, balancing the competing objectives of a) 881  properly informing stakeholders and overseers (including regulators) through required filings and 882  statements at hearings, versus b) protecting sensitive information from competitors and 883  adversaries. 884  3.2 Identify the Risks 885  The second step in the risk management life cycle involves identifying a comprehensive set of 886  risks and recording them in the risk register. This involves identifying those events that could 887  enhance or impede objectives, including the risks involved in failing to pursue opportunities. ICT 888  risk identification is composed of four inputs: 889  1. identification of the organization’s mission-supporting assets and their valuation, 890  2. determination of potential threats that might jeopardize the security or performance of 891  those assets and potential ICT opportunities that might benefit the organization, 892  3. consideration of the vulnerabilities of those assets, and 893  4. evaluation of the potential consequences of risk scenarios. 894  Sections 3.2.1 through 3.2.4 discuss each of these four inputs in more detail. 895  Risk practitioners often perform risk identification as both top-down and bottom-up exercises. 896  For example, after the organization has considered critical or mission-essential functions, it may 897  consider various types of issues that could jeopardize those functions as an input to risk scenario 898  NIST SP 800-221 ipd ENTERPRISE IMPACT OF INFORMATION  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  AND COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY RISK  17  development. Subsequently, as a detailed threat and vulnerability assessment occurs, assessors 899  consider how those threats might affect various assets by conducting a bottom-up assessment. 900  This bidirectional approach helps support holistic and comprehensive risk identification. 901  3.2.1 Inventory and Valuation of Assets 902  Since ICT risk reflects, at least in part, the effect of uncertainty on digital components that 903  support enterprise objectives, practitioners identify the assets that are necessary to achieve those 904  objectives. The value of an asset extends beyond its replacement cost. For example, an 905  organization could calculate the direct cost of research and development for a new product 906  offering, but the long-term losses associated with the theft of that intellectual property could 907  impact future revenue, share prices, enterprise reputation, and competitive advantage. A core 908  concept in ERM is prioritizing attention and resources on those assets that have the greatest 909  impact on an enterprise’s ability to achieve its mission (and, in the case of federal agencies, 910  impact that affects the public.) 911  Risk managers should leverage a business impact analysis (BIA) template that can be used to 912  consistently evaluate, record, and monitor the criticality and sensitivity of enterprise assets.12 It is 913  vitally important to gain senior stakeholders’ guidance regarding the determination of which 914  assets are critical or sensitive. Federal agencies are required to identify and record high value 915  assets, or HVAs. The relative importance of each enterprise asset is a necessary input for 916  considering the impact portion of risk analysis.  917  Note that many of the assets on which an organization depends are not within its direct control. 918  External technical assets may include cloud-based software or platform services, 919  telecommunications circuits, and video monitoring. Personnel may include the internal 920  workforce, external service providers, and third-party partners. 921  3.2.2 Determination of Potential Threats 922  ICT risk is not inherently good or bad. Rather, it represents the effects of uncertain 923  circumstances, so risk managers should consider a broad array of potential positive and negative 924  risks. The following sections primarily deal with negative risks. A threat represents any 925  circumstance or event with the potential to adversely impact organizational operations (a 926  negative risk)13. The threat could arise from a malicious person with harmful intent or from an 927  unintended or unavoidable situation (e.g., a natural disaster, technical failure, or human errors) 928  that may trigger a vulnerability. Numerous threat modeling techniques are available for 929  analyzing specific threats. It may be helpful to consider both a top-down approach (i.e., 930  reviewing critical or sensitive assets for what could potentially go wrong, regardless of threat 931  source) and a bottom-up approach (i.e., considering the potential impact of a given set of threat 932  or vulnerability scenarios). 933  12  For more information on BIA, see NIST IR 8286D [IR8286D].  13  The term threat is used throughout this publication to describe the source of any problem, circumstance, or event with the  potential to adversely impact organizational operations. The word threat may have specific meaning, and possibly greater or  lesser importance, within a given risk program.  NIST SP 800-221 ipd ENTERPRISE IMPACT OF INFORMATION  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  AND COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY RISK  18  One source of threat information is a high-level assessment based on various frameworks (e.g., 934  NIST Cybersecurity Framework, Privacy Framework, Secure Software Development 935  Framework). These frameworks often provide a way to determine the enterprise’s currently 936  implemented practices (i.e., current state) and ways to review the risk implications of that state to 937  identify potential risk scenarios. 938  One commonly used method that may help organizations identify potential risk outcomes is a 939  SWOT (strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, threats) analysis. Applying SWOT analysis helps 940  users identify opportunities that arise from organizational strengths (e.g., a well-respected 941  software development team) and threats (e.g., supply chain issues) that reflect an organizational 942  weakness. The use of SWOT analysis helps describe and consider the context described in 943  Section 3.1, including internal factors (strengths and weaknesses internal to the organization), 944  external factors (the opportunities and threats presented by the external environment), and ways 945  in which these factors relate to each other. 946  While it is critical that enterprises address potential negative impacts on mission and business 947  objectives, it is equally critical (and required for federal agencies) that enterprises plan for 948  success. OMB states in Circular A-123 that “the profile must identify sources of uncertainty, 949  both positive (opportunities) and negative (threats).” However, the notion of “planning for 950  success” by identifying and realizing positive risks (opportunities) is a relatively new concept in 951  ICTRM that is influencing other risk management disciplines. For the moment, it should be 952  noted that both positive and negative risks follow the same processes, from identification to 953  analysis to inclusion in the ERP. 954  Whatever means are used to determine potential threats, it is important to consider them in terms 955  of both the threat actors (i.e., the sources of risks with the capability to result in harmful impact) 956  and the threat events caused by their actions. 957  Combinations of multiple risks should also be considered. For example, if one risk in the register 958  refers to a website outage and another risk refers to an outage of the customer help desk, there 959  may need to be a third risk in the register that considers the likelihood and impact of an outage 960  affecting both services at once. It is also important to identify cascading risks where one primary 961  risk event may trigger a secondary and even a tertiary event. Analysis of the likelihood and 962  impact of these first-, second-, and third-order risks is described in Section 3.3. 963  During the threat modeling process, it is important for the practitioner to look out for and 964  mitigate instances of cognitive bias. Some common issues of bias include: 965  • Overconfidence – The tendency for stakeholders to be overly optimistic about risk 966  scenarios (e.g., unreasonably low likelihood of a threat event, overstated benefits of an 967  opportunity, exaggerated estimation of the ability to handle a threat) 968  • Group think – Rendering decisions as a group about potential threat sources and threat 969  events in a way that discourages creativity or individual responsibility 970  • Following trends – Blindly following the latest hype or craze without a detailed analysis 971  of the specific threats facing the organization 972  NIST SP 800-221 ipd ENTERPRISE IMPACT OF INFORMATION  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  AND COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY RISK  19  • Availability bias – The tendency to focus on issues (such as threats) that come readily to 973  mind because one has heard or read about them, perhaps in ways that are not 974  representative of the actual likelihood of a threat event occurring and resulting in adverse 975  impact 976  3.2.3 Determination of Exploitable and Susceptible Conditions 977  The next key input to risk identification is understanding the potential conditions that enable a 978  threat event to occur. It is important to consider all types of vulnerabilities in all assets, including 979  people, facilities, and information. For the purposes of this document, vulnerability is simply a 980  condition that enables a threat event to occur. It could be an unpatched software flaw, a raw 981  material limitation, a process that leads to human error, or a physical environmental condition 982  (like a wooden structure being flammable). The presence of a vulnerability does not cause harm 983  in and of itself, as there needs to be a threat present to exploit it. Moreover, a threat that does not 984  have a corresponding vulnerability may not result in a negative risk. Identifying negative risks 985  includes understanding the potential threats and vulnerabilities to organizational assets, which 986  can then be used to develop scenarios that describe potential risks. 987  Some weaknesses, such as software flaws or misconfigurations, can be identified using 988  automated scanners. These automated techniques may help to quickly identify some common 989  vulnerabilities, but ICT weaknesses are not limited to enterprise hardware and software. For the 990  ICT risk disciplines of privacy, supply chain, and cybersecurity, reviewing the controls described 991  in NIST SP 800-53, Security and Privacy Controls for Information Systems and Organizations, 992  may help highlight many potential weaknesses. [SP80053] 993  3.2.4 Evaluation of Potential Consequences 994  The final component of risk identification is documenting the potential consequences of each 995  risk listed in the register. Many organizations incorrectly express risks outside of their context. 996  For example, a stakeholder might say, “I’m worried about floods,” or “I’m concerned about a 997  denial-of-service attack.” These examples cannot be analyzed or considered without knowing the 998  full picture. Considering the above factors, an effective example of an identified risk might be 999  (as expressed in cause-and-effect terminology), “If a hurricane causes a storm surge, it could 1000  flood the data center and damage multiple critical file servers.” 1001  Notably, ICT risks that cause unexpected or unreliable behavior in a system do not always result 1002  in the complete failure of that system to fulfill its duty in support of business objectives. Many 1003  elements of a risk management plan are implemented to support redundancy and resilience so 1004  that a highly likely threat event might result in manageable consequences. Resilient enterprise 1005  systems may be able to continue operating in the face of adverse circumstances. 1006  3.2.5 Risk Register Use 1007  Risk registers are used within organizations to communicate and track ICT risks over time. By 1008  combining the results of Sections 3.2.1 through 3.2.4, the practitioner can create a set of risk 1009  scenarios in the Risk Description column of the risk register. Risk scenarios provide a means to 1010  present detailed risk information in context. A complete risk scenario describes the source of 1011  uncertainty, predisposing conditions, resources affected, and anticipated result. For ICT risks, a 1012  NIST SP 800-221 ipd ENTERPRISE IMPACT OF INFORMATION  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  AND COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY RISK  20  scenario might include a threat source, a threat event, a vulnerability that threat source might 1013  exploit, enterprise assets impacted by the threat, and the resulting harmful impact. For example, 1014  “Construction activity severs a critical fiber optic cable that was not protected in conduit, 1015  interrupting communications to the data center and resulting in the loss of availability of 1016  enterprise financial systems.” Scenarios may also help to describe positive risk (i.e., 1017  opportunity). An example of this might be, “Construction of a new alternate data center improves 1018  the resilience of financial infrastructure and reduces the likelihood of an interruption.” 1019  Figure 5 shows a notional risk register template. The notional template includes many of the 1020  elements suggested by OMB Circular A-11. It illustrates only the current risk assessment (i.e., 1021  likelihood, impact, and resulting exposure value). Organizations will need to determine which 1022  assessments should be reflected in the risk register. Because this document describes the risk 1023  register as an input into ERM processes, only the current risk assessment results are depicted. 1024  Some organizations may wish to include both the current risk assessment (before risk response is 1025  applied) and the anticipated changes to risk that are expected to result based on the risk response. 1026  1027  Figure 5: Notional Risk Register Template 1028  Table 4 describes each of the elements in the notional risk register template. The actual 1029  composition of the register will vary among enterprises and may contain more or fewer data 1030  points than those described in Table 4. For example: 1031  • If the register is to be updated after the risk response, the results of a post-response 1032  assessment could be reflected in the register as the residual risk.  1033  • Organizations might document a desired risk state based on risk appetite/tolerance, the 1034  target residual risk.  1035  Table 4: Descriptions of Notional Risk Register Template Elements 1036  Register Element Description  ID (Risk Identifier) A sequential numeric identifier for referring to a risk in the risk register.  Priority A relative indicator of the criticality of this risk, either expressed in ordinal value (e.g., 1,  2, 3) or in reference to a given scale (e.g., high, moderate, low).  Risk Description A brief explanation of the risk scenario (potentially) impacting the organization and  enterprise. Risk descriptions are often written in a cause-and-effect format, such as “if X  occurs, then Y happens.”  NIST SP 800-221 ipd ENTERPRISE IMPACT OF INFORMATION  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  AND COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY RISK  21  Register Element Description  Risk Category An organizing construct that enables multiple risk register entries to be consolidated.  Consistent risk categorization is helpful for comparing risk registers during the risk  aggregation step of ERM.  Current Assessment –  Likelihood  An estimation of the probability that this scenario will occur before any risk response. On  the first iteration of the risk cycle, this may also be considered the initial assessment.  Current Assessment – Impact  Analysis of the potential benefits or consequences that might result from this scenario if  no additional response is provided. On the first iteration of the risk cycle, this may also  be considered the initial assessment.  Current Assessment –  Exposure Rating  A calculation of the probability of risk exposure based on the likelihood estimate and the  determined benefits or consequences of the risk. Throughout this report, the  combination of impact and likelihood is referred to as exposure. Other common  frameworks use different terms for this combination, such as level of risk (e.g., ISO  31000). On the first iteration of the risk cycle, this may also be considered the initial  assessment.  Risk Response Type The risk response (sometimes referred to as the risk treatment) for handling the  identified risk. Values for risk response types are listed in Table 5 of this document.  Risk Response Cost The estimated cost of applying the risk response.  Risk Response  Description  A brief description of the risk response. For example, “Implement software management  application XYZ to ensure that software platforms and applications are inventoried,” or  “Develop and implement a process to ensure the timely receipt of threat intelligence from  [name of specific information sharing forums and sources].”  Risk Owner The designated party responsible and accountable for ensuring that the risk is  maintained in accordance with enterprise requirements. The risk owner may work with a  designated risk manager who is responsible for managing and monitoring the selected  risk response.  Status A field for tracking the current condition of the risk and any next activities.  Regardless of which model is selected for use as a risk register, it is important for the enterprise 1037  to ensure that the model is used in a consistent and iterative way. As the risk professional 1038  progresses through the steps in Section 3, the risk register will be populated with relevant 1039  information. Once decisions have been made as part of a subsequent review of the risks, the 1040  agreed-upon risk response becomes the current state after mitigations are put in place, and the 1041  cycle begins anew. 1042  Using risk registers for ICT uncertainty provides consistency in capturing, organizing, and 1043  communicating risk-related information throughout the ICTRM and ERM processes. The risk 1044  registers used at each level convey information about risk assessments, evaluation decisions, 1045  responses, and monitoring activities. The remainder of this section provides guidance and useful 1046  information for completing and using registers and integrating them with ERM. 1047  While the risk register itself can be used to document and communicate information about 1048  current risks and responses, it may be necessary to supplement the register with a risk detail 1049  record (RDR). A notional example of an RDR is provided in Appendix B. The use of RDRs 1050  enables the documentation of details regarding the considerations, assumptions, and results of 1051  risk management activity. It also enables the enterprise to record personnel involved in those 1052  considerations, any actions to be taken, and schedules. Contents of an RDR may include: 1053  ● Information regarding the risk itself, such as a detailed risk scenario description and 1054  underlying threats, vulnerabilities, assets threatened, risk category, and risk assessment 1055  results 1056  NIST SP 800-221 ipd ENTERPRISE IMPACT OF INFORMATION  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  AND COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY RISK  22  ● Roles involved in risk decisions and management (e.g., risk owner, risk manager, action 1057  owner for specific activities, stakeholders involved in risk response decisions, contractual 1058  agreements for supply chain/external partners) 1059  ● Schedule considerations, such as the date the risk was first documented, the date of the 1060  last risk assessment, completion dates for mitigations, and the date of the next expected 1061  assessment 1062  ● Risk response decisions and follow-up, including detailed plans, status, and risk 1063  indicators 1064  An RDR may be stored and maintained in a written record, as part of an organizational 1065  knowledge management system, or as a database entry in risk-specific software, such as a 1066  Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC) application.  1067  3.3 Analyze (Quantify) the Risks 1068  In Step 3 of the risk management life cycle, each ICT risk is analyzed to estimate the likelihood 1069  that the risk event will occur, and the potential impact of the consequences is described. 1070  3.3.1 Risk Analysis Types 1071  Relying solely on an informal risk analysis may impair effective ICTRM decision support. A 1072  broad array of risk analysis methodologies is available to aid in making a more accurate 1073  estimation, such as International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) 31010:2019 [IEC31010] 1074  and the Open Group’s Open Factor Analysis of Information Risk (FAIR) standards 1075  [OPENFAIR]. Risk analysis methods include: 1076  • Qualitative analysis, based on the assignment of a descriptor, such as low, medium, or 1077  high. The scale can be formed or adjusted to suit the circumstances, and different 1078  descriptions may be used for different risks. Qualitative analysis is helpful as an initial 1079  assessment or when intangible aspects of risk are to be considered. To improve the 1080  accuracy of qualitative analysis, values and data can be leveraged from external sources, 1081  such as industry benchmarks or standards, metrics from similar previous risk scenarios, 1082  or findings from inspections and assessments. 1083  • Quantitative analysis involves numerical values, which are assigned to both impact and 1084  likelihood. These values are based on statistical probabilities and a monetized valuation 1085  of loss or gain. The quality of the analysis depends on the accuracy of the assigned values 1086  and the validity of the statistical models used. Consequences may be expressed in terms 1087  of financial, technical, or human impacts. 1088  Some practitioners apply a semi-quantitative assessment that uses a numerical scale that 1089  represents some range of values or meanings in the enterprise context. The application of this 1090  model helps translate risk analysis into qualitative terms that support risk communications for 1091  decision makers while also supporting relative comparisons (such as within a particular scale or 1092  range). 1093  Each of these analysis types has advantages and disadvantages, so the type performed should be 1094  consistent with the context associated with the risk. The methods to be selected and under what 1095  NIST SP 800-221 ipd ENTERPRISE IMPACT OF INFORMATION  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  AND COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY RISK  23  circumstances depend on many organizational factors and might be included in the risk 1096  management discussions described in Section 3.1. While qualitative methods are commonplace, 1097  the practitioner may benefit from considering a quantitative methodology with a more scientific 1098  approach to estimating the likelihood and the impact of consequences where the data is available 1099  for this type of analysis. This may help to better prioritize risks or prepare more accurate risk 1100  exposure forecasts. The benefits of such an approach may be offset by the fact that changing the 1101  risk assessment methodology may require time and resources for development and training. 1102  Common ERM practices include both qualitative and quantitative types of risk analysis. When 1103  selecting the most appropriate type of risk analysis at the system or organization level, 1104  practitioners should consider both consistency with ERM at the enterprise level and the accuracy 1105  of measuring ICT risks. 1106  3.3.2 Techniques for Estimating Likelihood and Impact 1107  Since one of the primary goals of ICTRM is to identify potential risks that are most likely to 1108  have a significant impact, an accurate reflection of risk details is critical. Fortunately, risk 1109  management has been practiced for many years, and there are many effective techniques for 1110  analyzing risk in comparison with enterprise risk appetite and system or organizational risk 1111  tolerance. IEC 31010 [IEC31010] is an international standard that describes and provides 1112  guidance on 17 risk assessment techniques that can be used for analyzing controls, dependencies, 1113  and interactions; understanding consequence and likelihood; and measuring overall risk. In 1114  addition to analysis techniques like those described below, understanding the likelihood of threat 1115  events and their potential impacts will also draw on experimentation, investigations into previous 1116  risk events, and research into the risk experiences of similar organizations. 1117  The likelihood and impact elements of a risk can be broken into sub-factors. For example, 1118  consider a risk scenario in which a critical business server becomes unavailable to an 1119  organization’s financial department. The age of the server, the network on which it resides, and 1120  the reliability of its software all influence the likelihood of a failure. The impact of this scenario 1121  can also be considered through various factors. If another server is highly available through a 1122  fault-tolerant connection, the loss of the initial server may have little consequence. Other factors 1123  also impact risk analysis, such as timing. If the financial server supports an important payroll 1124  function, the impact of a loss occurring shortly before payday may be significantly higher than if 1125  it were to occur after paychecks are distributed. The impact may vary greatly depending on 1126  whether the server is used for archiving legacy records or performing urgent stock trades. There 1127  are many considerations that go into estimating exposures and the events that can trigger them. 1128  Whichever sub-factors an organization chooses to consider, they should be clearly delineated and 1129  defined to ensure consistency in their use for likelihood and frequency estimation as well as 1130  overall risk register assessment and aggregation. 1131  The calculation of multiple or cascading impacts is an important consideration, and each 1132  permutation should be individually included in the risk register. Secondary loss events should be 1133  captured with primary loss events to represent the total impact and cost of a risk scenario. The 1134  omission of secondary losses in the assessment of a risk scenario would underestimate the total 1135  impact, thereby misinforming risk response selection and prioritization. For example, while the 1136  organization might consider a risk that a telecommunications outage would result in the loss of 1137  NIST SP 800-221 ipd ENTERPRISE IMPACT OF INFORMATION  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  AND COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY RISK  24  availability of a critical web server, there may also be secondary loss events, including the loss of 1138  customers from frustration with unavailable services or penalties resulting from the failure to 1139  meet contractual service levels. An analysis of cascading risks should include the consideration 1140  of factors that would lead to a secondary risk, such as the outage described above. 1141  Examples of techniques for estimating the probability that a risk event will occur include: 1142  • Bayesian analysis – A model that helps inform a statistical understanding of probability 1143  as more evidence or information becomes available 1144  • Monte-Carlo – A simulation model that draws upon random sample values from a given 1145  set of inputs, performs calculations to determine results, and iteratively repeats the 1146  process to build up a distribution of the results 1147  • Event tree analysis – A modeling technique that represents a set of potential events that 1148  could arise following an initiating event from which quantifiable probabilities could be 1149  considered graphically 1150  Both tangible (e.g., direct financial losses) and less tangible impacts (e.g., reputational damage 1151  and impairment of mission) should be considered when evaluating the potential consequences of 1152  risk events. These are connected since direct losses will affect reputation, and reputational risk 1153  events will nearly always result in risk response expenses. OMB Circular A-123 states that 1154  “reputational risk damages the reputation of an agency or component of an agency to the point of 1155  having a detrimental effect capable of affecting the agency’s ability to carry out mission 1156  objectives.” There is a broad range of stakeholders to be considered when estimating reputational 1157  risk, including the workforce, partners, suppliers, regulators, legislators, public constituents, and 1158  clients/customers. 1159  Practitioners document and track the potential consequences of each ICT risk that would 1160  significantly impact enterprise objectives, such as causing material reputation damage or 1161  significant financial losses to the enterprise. Documenting and tracking these consequences at the 1162  organization or system level streamlines the step of providing ICT risk inputs to the ERM 1163  program. 1164  The estimation of the likelihood and impact of a risk event should account for existing and 1165  planned controls. The ERM Playbook provides the following guidance: 1166  Identifying existing controls is an important step in the risk analysis process. Internal 1167  controls (such as separation of duties or conducting robust testing before introducing new 1168  software) can reduce the likelihood of a risk materializing and the impact. […] One way 1169  to estimate the effect of a control is to consider how it reduces the threat likelihood and 1170  how effective it is against exploiting vulnerabilities and the impact of threats. Execution 1171  is key – the presence of internal controls does not mean they are necessarily effective. 1172  [ERMPLAYBOOK] 1173  The estimated likelihood and impact of each risk are recorded in the appropriate columns within 1174  the risk register. After risk responses are determined, the analysis should be revised to reflect the 1175  mitigation (of likelihood and impact) from each risk response. The residual risk (i.e., the 1176  remaining risk after applying risk responses) should then be recorded in the risk register’s 1177  NIST SP 800-221 ipd ENTERPRISE IMPACT OF INFORMATION  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  AND COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY RISK  25  Residual Risk column. To simplify the process of normalizing risk registers when developing an 1178  ERR, a consistent time frame should be used for estimating the likelihood of each risk. Likewise, 1179  the level of impact helps to normalize the risk during the aggregation and prioritization process. 1180  3.4 Prioritize Risks 1181  After identifying and analyzing applicable risks and recording them in risk registers, the 1182  priorities of those risks should be determined and indicated. This is accomplished by determining 1183  the exposure presented by each risk (i.e., based on the likelihood that a threat event will occur 1184  and result in an adverse impact). 1185  An ICT risk can have adverse effects on achieving organizational objectives. Based on the 1186  analysis conducted using the processes described in Section 3.3, such effects could range from 1187  negligible to severe, so exposure determination is important. Additionally, since organizations 1188  have limited resources, it is helpful to sort the risks within the register in order of importance to 1189  prioritize risk response. As shown in the template in Figure 5, this result helps complete the 1190  Priority column.14 1191  When completing the Priority column of the risk register, consider the following: 1192  • How to combine the calculations of likelihood and impact to determine exposure15 1193  • How to determine and measure the potential benefits of pursuing a particular risk 1194  response 1195  • When to seek additional guidance on how to evaluate risk exposure levels, such as while 1196  evaluating exposures germane to risk tolerance statements 1197  Practitioners use both qualitative and quantitative models for calculating and communicating 1198  about exposure. Figure 6 demonstrates the use of qualitative descriptors for likelihood and 1199  impact as well as how these might be used to determine an overall exposure value.16 Each risk is 1200  evaluated in light of the risk’s likelihood and impact as determined during risk analysis. The 1201  thresholds for ranges of exposure can be established and published as part of the enterprise 1202  governance model and used by stakeholders to prioritize each risk in the register. 1203  14  While risks in the register are assigned a priority to help rank their relative importance, this prioritization is distinct from  (but may help inform) the enterprise-level prioritization performed by senior leaders to create the enterprise risk profile.  15  The formula for calculating risk exposure is the total loss if the risk occurs multiplied by the probability that the risk will  happen. Loss is calculated through a traditional BIA used in conjunction with the risk register model to inform the senior- level decision-making process.  16  Individual risk programs may have varying views on how to calculate and record likelihood in program risk registers. Most  risk programs view likelihood as a factor of threat and vulnerability. Risk programs are encouraged to use the risk  adjudication and communication process as an opportunity to discuss and standardize any program-specific likelihood  calculation.  NIST SP 800-221 ipd ENTERPRISE IMPACT OF INFORMATION  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  AND COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY RISK  26  1204  Figure 6: Example of a Qualitative Risk Matrix 1205  Figure 7 depicts a quantitative example. In this illustration, the enterprise has provided guidance 1206  that any risk above 0.20 (based on likelihood times impact) represents a high risk, and risks rated 1207  between 0.06 and 0.20 are designated as moderate. 1208  1209  Figure 7: Example of a Quantitative Risk Matrix 1210  While prioritization will be strongly influenced by the risk exposure determination, other factors 1211  such as enterprise context or stakeholder priorities may also influence those decisions. 1212  Stakeholders might also define a minimum level of exposure to include on the risk register 1213  through the risk management strategy or other directives. While ICT risks should not arbitrarily 1214  be omitted from the register, there are likely to be many that represent such a low exposure that 1215  they need not be included. Guidance for this threshold should be applied consistently throughout 1216  the enterprise. 1217  For those ICT risks that are included and prioritized in the risk register, an evaluation should be 1218  performed to identify an appropriate risk response, as described in the next topic. 1219  3.5 Plan and Execute Risk Response Strategies 1220  The fifth step of the risk management life cycle is to determine the appropriate response to each 1221  risk. The goal of effective risk management, including ICT risks, is to identify ways to keep risk 1222  aligned with the risk appetite or tolerance in as cost-effective a way as possible. In this stage, the 1223  practitioner will determine whether the exposure associated with each risk in the register is 1224  NIST SP 800-221 ipd ENTERPRISE IMPACT OF INFORMATION  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  AND COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY RISK  27  within acceptable levels based on the potential consequences. If not, that practitioner can identify 1225  and select cost-effective risk response options to achieve ICT objectives. 1226  Planning and executing risk responses is an iterative activity and should be based on the risk 1227  strategy guidance described in Section 3.1.3. As the risk oversight authorities monitor the 1228  success of those responses, they will provide operational leaders with financial and mission 1229  guidance to inform future risk management activities. In some cases, risk evaluation may lead to 1230  a decision to undertake further analysis to confirm estimates or more closely monitor results (as 1231  described in Section 4.2). Note that risk responses themselves may introduce new risks. For 1232  example, adding multi-factor authentication to a business system to reduce an access control risk 1233  may introduce a new risk of decreased productivity when users have difficulty authenticating. 1234  While there is some variance among the terms used by risk management frameworks, there are 1235  four types of actions available (as described in Table 5) for responding to negative ICT risks: 1236  accept, transfer, mitigate, and avoid. 1237  Table 5: Response Types for Negative ICT Risks 1238  Type Description  Accept Accept ICT risk within risk tolerance levels. No additional risk response action is needed except for  monitoring.  Transfer For ICT risks that fall outside of tolerance levels, reduce them to an acceptable level by sharing a  portion of the consequences with another party (e.g., ICT insurance). While some of the financial  consequences may be transferable, there are often consequences that cannot be transferred, like a  loss of customer trust.  Mitigate Apply actions (e.g., risk management controls) that reduce a given risk to an acceptable level.  Responses could include those that help prevent a loss (i.e., reducing the probability of occurrence or  the likelihood that a threat event materializes or succeeds) or that help limit such a loss by decreasing  the amount of damage and liability.  Avoid Apply responses to ensure that the risk (specifically the threat) does not occur. Avoiding a risk may be  the best option if there is not a cost-effective method for reducing the ICT risk to an acceptable level.  The cost of the lost opportunity associated with such a decision should be considered as well.  In many cases, mitigation to bring exposure to negative ICT risks within risk tolerance levels is 1239  accomplished using risk management controls. For example, if the risk executive function 1240  declares that the organization must avoid risks with likelihood and impact values of high/high for 1241  all costs over $500,000, the Risk Response Type column of the risk register (see Figure 5) can be 1242  updated with a response type from Table 5. While including a particular informative reference 1243  (e.g., security controls or Cybersecurity Framework and/or Privacy Framework categories and 1244  subcategories) may be helpful in guiding and describing risk response, additional information is 1245  likely to be required. 1246  In general, people, processes, and technology combine to provide risk management controls that 1247  can be applied to achieve an acceptable level of risk. Examples of controls include: 1248  • Preventative: Reduce or eliminate specific instances of a weakness 1249  • Deterrent: Reduce the likelihood of a threat event by dissuading a threat actor 1250  • Detective: Provide warning of a successful or attempted threat event 1251  • Corrective: Reduce exposure by offsetting the impact of consequences after a risk event 1252  NIST SP 800-221 ipd ENTERPRISE IMPACT OF INFORMATION  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  AND COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY RISK  28  • Compensating: Apply one or more controls to adjust for a weakness in another control 1253  Consider an organization that identifies several high-exposure negative risks, including that poor 1254  authentication practices (e.g., weak or reused passwords) could enable the disclosure of sensitive 1255  customer financial information and that employees of the software provider might gain 1256  unauthorized access to and tamper with the financial data. The organization can apply several 1257  deterrent controls (documenting the applied control identifiers and any applicable notes in the 1258  Risk Register Comments column), including warning banners and the threat of prosecution for 1259  any threat actors that intentionally attempt to gain unauthorized access. Preventative controls 1260  include applying strong identity management policies and using multi-factor authentication 1261  tokens that help reduce authentication vulnerabilities. The software provider has installed 1262  detective controls that monitor access logs and alert the organization’s security operations center 1263  if internal staff connect to the customer database without a need for access. Furthermore, the 1264  financial database is encrypted so that it protects its data if the file system is exfiltrated. 1265  Risk response will often involve creating a risk reserve to avoid or mitigate an identified 1266  negative risk or to realize or enhance an identified positive risk. A risk reserve is similar to other 1267  types of management reserves in that funding or labor hours are set aside and employed if a risk 1268  is triggered to ensure that the opportunity is realized or the threat is avoided. For example, the 1269  technical skills needed to recover after an ICT attack may not be available with current staffing 1270  resources. A risk reserve can also be used with the accept response type to address this (e.g., by 1271  setting aside funds during project planning to employ a qualified third party to augment the 1272  internal incident response and recovery effort.) 1273  3.6 Monitor, Evaluate, and Adjust Risk Management 1274  Risk management should not be simply managing lists of risks. For the activities to be 1275  meaningful, risk managers throughout the enterprise must be informed about objectives, results, 1276  priorities, and opportunities. A key purpose of 1277  the various risk registers is to enable ongoing 1278  monitoring of enterprise risk activities. Based 1279  on those activities, senior leaders evaluate 1280  available options and adjust guidance and 1281  operations to help realize opportunities and 1282  minimize harmful impacts. This Monitor-1283  Evaluate-Adjust (MEA) cycle is depicted in 1284  Figure 8. This iterative approach begins with 1285  an understanding of what risk limits are 1286  acceptable, given enterprise context and 1287  strategic objectives. The purpose of ICTRM 1288  integration is to enable senior leaders to remain 1289  aware of ongoing risk management activities 1290  and apply corrective measures in order to 1291  achieve strategic objectives.  1292  As risk response activities occur, they are recorded 1293  in ICT risk registers. The results are monitored, 1294  Figure 8: Monitor-Evaluate-Adjust Cycle  NIST SP 800-221 ipd ENTERPRISE IMPACT OF INFORMATION  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  AND COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY RISK  29  and performance measurements are collected through KPIs and KRIs and compared with risk 1295  strategy and risk direction (based on risk appetite and risk tolerance statements). Leaders provide 1296  direction regarding an overall appetite for risk, which is then interpreted at a more granular level 1297  as risk tolerance statements. Those risk directives are achieved through the application of various 1298  controls that modify the risk conditions. The metrics are reported to managers and leaders, 1299  enabling oversight and management of the achievement of the risk tolerance. 1300  Previous discussions highlighted risk direction based on risk appetite statements and their 1301  interpretation as risk tolerance statements. There is a third component of risk direction that must 1302  be observed – that of risk capacity, defined as the maximum amount of risk that an organization 1303  is able to endure. While the enterprise should always take steps not to exceed risk appetite, the 1304  consequences of doing so are rarely catastrophic. Exceeding risk capacity, on the other hand, 1305  could have dire consequences and may even jeopardize the continuance of the enterprise. 1306  Catastrophic results are not limited to the private sector. Many government entities have 1307  experienced severe consequences because their risk management processes permitted those 1308  enterprises to approach or exceed risk capacity. Such cases can end the career of senior leaders 1309  whose risk monitoring should have identified the risk conditions. 1310  It is noteworthy that, like risk appetite and tolerance, risk capacity can extend throughout the 1311  hierarchical enterprise layers. For example, if a business unit or government bureau exceeded its 1312  risk capacity, that portion of the enterprise could be severely impeded or closed. ISACA states 1313  that exceeding risk capacity could result in the enterprise’s continued existence being questioned 1314  [ISACA]. ISO 31010:2019 describes a similar example: “For a commercial firm, capacity might 1315  be specified in terms of maximum retention capacity covered by assets, or the largest financial 1316  loss the company could bear without having to declare bankruptcy.” [IEC31010] While 1317  exceeding risk capacity might not immediately result in enterprise extinction, it is clearly a 1318  criterion that must be monitored closely. Because capacity reflects the aggregate risk, it is an 1319  important consideration for those aggregating ICTRM and evaluating the overall risk posture. 1320  3.6.1 When a Risk Event Passes Without Triggering the Event 1321  Risk responses will often be adjusted as opportunities and threats evolve. The concept is similar 1322  to the topic sometimes called the “Cone of Uncertainty” within project management practices; 1323  over time, additional understanding about an identified risk will come to light. For changes in 1324  identified risk, one mitigation technique is the use of risk reserves, as introduced in Section 3.5. 1325  For this risk response, it is important that the risk owners collaborate with the acquisition or 1326  procurement teams and budget owners. With appropriate budget planning, risk reserves can be 1327  released for other predetermined funding requirements after the risk has been reduced to an 1328  acceptable level or the time has passed for the risk to occur. 1329  While many industry-based enterprises can return unused funds to shareholders or pay down 1330  corporate debt, unused reserves are more difficult for government agencies to use without pre-1331  planning. Most government procurement cycles are rigidly based on the government fiscal year. 1332  Identified opportunities can be “planned for” in government procurement cycles as “optional” 1333  tasking or purchases. For example, unused funds could be used to expand a vendor assessment 1334  program to ensure that all supply chain providers (including both immediate service providers 1335  and their downstream providers) fulfill data processing and privacy risk management 1336  NIST SP 800-221 ipd ENTERPRISE IMPACT OF INFORMATION  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  AND COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY RISK  30  requirements. If the current fiscal year only allows for the purchase of half of the required 1337  materials, an option can be included at the time of the base contract award for the other half of 1338  the materials (but not funded at the time of the base contract award). When the practitioner 1339  liberates the risk reserve after the chance of the negative risk occurring has passed, the funding 1340  can be used to exercise the already awarded option that lacked the initial funding when the base 1341  contract was awarded. Exercising an option in government contracting is trivial (often 30 days or 1342  less) when compared to the long lead time for initial contract procurements. 1343  3.7 Considerations of Positive Risks as an Input to ERM 1344  Planning for success is equally as important as avoiding disasters. As mentioned in Section 3.2.2, 1345  OMB states in Circular A-123 that, regarding the inclusion of opportunities (positive risks) as a 1346  function of the ERM profile, “the profile must identify sources of uncertainty, both positive 1347  (opportunities) and negative (threats).” In ICT disciplines, a significant portion of risk 1348  information is collected and reported with regard to weaknesses and threats that could result in 1349  negative consequences. However, positive risks (opportunities) also inform decisions by senior 1350  leaders for setting the risk appetite and tolerance of the enterprise.  1351  From an opportunity standpoint, risk appetite statements can identify areas where the 1352  organization needs to stretch further to reach goals and are expressed as those targeted areas 1353  where some loss is acceptable without crossing important lines of demarcation (e.g., innovative 1354  solutions should be pursued but not at the cost of life, safety, compliance with laws/regulations, 1355  or reputation). Understanding that private-sector organizations pursue risk as part of their growth 1356  strategies and competitive advantage, this aspect should not be forgotten. Similarly, public-sector 1357  agencies typically have stretch goals to keep up with industry needs, customer expectations, 1358  market demands, or other influences. 1359  An example of identifying positive risks is conducting a SWOT analysis that considers strengths 1360  and weaknesses as well as threats and opportunities. Consider, for example, an organization that 1361  is evaluating moving a major financial system from an in-house data center to a commercial 1362  hosting provider. If the organization maintains vast amounts of land and warehouses, the move 1363  could be considered a strength of the organization, and they might increase revenue by offering 1364  space to a commercial vendor to host both their own and other organizations’ data centers. The 1365  Federal Government has realized many opportunities of this nature, including consolidating 1366  payroll functions under the National Finance Center (NFC) and consolidating reporting 1367  requirements in the Department of Justice Cyber Security Assessment and Management (CSAM) 1368  application. 1369  Section 3.2.2 describes the need to treat threat actors and threat sources as inputs into an 1370  estimation of risk. If the enterprise chooses to include positive risk scenarios in the register, then 1371  the process should similarly consider sources of opportunity that might provide benefits. A 1372  consideration of both threats and opportunities may enable discussions regarding the benefits and 1373  risks of a particular endeavor. Alternatively, the organization could manage an opportunity risk 1374  register separately from the traditional threat-based risk register since positive risks (i.e., 1375  opportunities) often have to be assessed on a slightly different scale. 1376  NIST SP 800-221 ipd ENTERPRISE IMPACT OF INFORMATION  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  AND COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY RISK  31  In addition to the threat modeling examples above, methods for identifying ICT-related 1377  opportunities are also available and could be as simple as an employee suggestion box. Industry 1378  publications, such as those from commercial industry associations and agencies like NIST, 1379  regularly provide information and ideas regarding potential innovations or advances for areas 1380  such as supply chain, privacy, and cybersecurity improvements. 1381  Numerous formal methods are available for identifying opportunities, including: 1382  ● Brainstorming – A group innovation technique, often led by a facilitator, that elicits views 1383  from participants to identify and describe opportunities 1384  ● Delphi – A procedure to gain consensus from a group of subject matter experts using one or 1385  more individual questionnaires that are collected and collated to identify opportunities to 1386  pursue 1387  ● Ideation – A consistent process of observing an environment, discerning opportunities for 1388  improvement, experimenting with possible resolutions, and developing innovative solutions 1389  The same formal methods can be used for determining other inputs, such as those described in 1390  Sections 3.2.3 and 3.2.4. 1391  With regard to positive risk response, consider the previous example of an organization that has 1392  identified the positive risk of increasing revenue by providing physical space for a commercial 1393  vendor to offer an outsourcing service. Analysis of the risk has determined that the opportunity 1394  would be highly beneficial to the enterprise. The colocation also provides a moderate opportunity 1395  to improve availability as an element of supply chain risk management. The Risk Response Type 1396  column of the risk register should also be updated using a response type from Table 5, the 1397  comment field updated to contain information pertinent to the opportunity, and the residual risk 1398  uncertainty of not realizing the opportunity calculated. 1399  With these controls and methods in place and assessed as effective, the remaining risks can be 1400  analyzed to determine the residual impact, likelihood, and exposure, as described in Section 3.3. 1401  If the residual exposure falls within risk tolerance levels, then stakeholders can proceed in 1402  gaining the benefits of the opportunity. Each of these values is added to the risk register for 1403  enterprise reporting and monitoring. 1404  Where positive risks are to be considered and included in risk registers, there are four generally 1405  used response types, as described in Table 6. 1406  Table 6: Response Types for Positive ICT Risks 1407  Type Description  Realize Eliminate uncertainty to make sure the opportunity is actualized (sometimes referenced as exploit).  Share Allocate ownership to another party that is better able to capture the opportunity.  Enhance Increase the probability and positive impact of an opportunity (e.g., hire a risk management staff  member to better focus on an organization’s privacy risk and data processing protections).  Accept Take advantage of an opportunity if it happens to present itself (e.g., identify and prioritize those  supply chain risk gaps that should be addressed at the first opportunity).  NIST SP 800-221 ipd ENTERPRISE IMPACT OF INFORMATION  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  AND COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY RISK  32  As with negative risks, positive entries in the ICT risk registers should be normalized and 1408  aggregated into the enterprise-level risk register. 1409  As shown in Figure 9, this publication focuses on the integration of ICT risk from various 1410  disciplines in support of an ERM integration cycle. The document acknowledges the need for 1411  ongoing bidirectional communication between ERM and risk programs, recognizing that the risk 1412  disciplines both inform and receive direction from ERM. It shows that the communication of risk 1413  appetite statements from the ERM portfolio is a way for risk programs to better identify and 1414  monitor risks using a variety of related methods such as risk tolerance statements, key 1415  performance indicators, key risk indicators, and controls. Similarly, this publication formalizes 1416  the use of risk registers to communicate risks and risk responses among program and portfolio 1417  levels. It highlights industry practices for coordination through elevation of risks for oversight 1418  and escalating risks for higher-level ownership. 1419  NIST SP 800-221 ipd ENTERPRISE IMPACT OF INFORMATION  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  AND COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY RISK  33  4 Building ERRs and ERPs from ICTRM-Specific Risk Registers 1420  The achievement of defined expectations is 1421  conveyed through risk registers that 1422  document and communicate risk decisions. 1423  Risk assessment results and risk response 1424  actions at the system level are reflected in 1425  the ICT risk registers. The registers from 1426  multiple systems are collated, aggregated, 1427  and normalized, then provided to business 1428  managers at the organization level to 1429  provide a composite risk understanding. 1430  Those managers can evaluate results and 1431  refine risk tolerance criteria to optimize 1432  value delivery, resource utilization, and risk. 1433  The enterprise-level aggregation of all the 1434  various risk registers into an enterprise risk 1435  register (ERR), then a prioritized enterprise 1436  risk profile (ERP), enables senior leaders to 1437  monitor risk responses while considering the 1438  expectations set.  1439  This section takes a closer look at how ICT 1440  risk registers are used as the inputs for 1441  building an ERR and ultimately an ERP, as 1442  depicted in Figure 9. 1443  4.1 Creating and Maintaining 1444  Enterprise-Level ICT Risk Registers 1445  A key outcome of the risk identification and 1446  communications elements is the ability to 1447  create enterprise-level ICT risk registers as 1448  input to the broader ERR (Section 4.2). As 1449  described throughout Section 3, the 1450  application of a consistent risk register with agreed-upon criteria and categories enables various 1451  data points to be normalized, aggregated, and sorted into an enterprise view. 1452  Risk registers are composed and maintained at all levels: enterprise (including higher-level and 1453  lower-level enterprises), organization (including suborganizations and business units), and 1454  system.17 The vertical columns in Figure 4 should not be interpreted as guidance to address such 1455  risks as isolated silos, but rather that information for various types of ICT risks should be shared 1456  with those in higher organizational levels for the benefit of the whole enterprise. Similarly, 1457  ICTRM should not be isolated at only one organizational level nor within a single ICT risk 1458  17  OMB Circular A-130 defines an information system as “a discrete set of information resources organized for the collection,  processing, maintenance, use, sharing, dissemination, or disposition of information.” [OMB-A123]  Figure 9: ICTRM Integration Cycle  NIST SP 800-221 ipd ENTERPRISE IMPACT OF INFORMATION  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  AND COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY RISK  34  discipline. Instead, those in an organizational level should collaborate and communicate about 1459  issues, problems, and opportunities identified. As lessons learned about successes and challenges 1460  are shared among peers, that information can be conveyed to other organizations and to 1461  enterprise management, including by using risk registers and RDRs. 1462  For each risk discipline, as the risk registers from each system and organization are completed, 1463  they are provided to the designated risk officers at the relevant level (i.e., system or organization) 1464  and shared with senior management to conduct the following actions: 1) normalize (e.g., ensure 1465  definitions and values as recorded by various enterprise entities are consistent and remove 1466  duplicate risk reporting) and 2) aggregate risks in similar categories into a concise view. 1467  To support the subsequent aggregation of various risk registers, enterprise risk guidance should 1468  identify the enterprise objectives to which various types of ICT risk should be aligned. The ERP 1469  reflects risks that may have impact in each of four discrete enterprise objectives: strategic, 1470  operations, reporting, and compliance. These same four objectives were key factors in the 1471  original COSO ERM framework and are often used as guideposts for enterprise risk reporting. 1472  Clear direction from senior leaders about how to align various types of ICT risk with enterprise 1473  objectives will help enable subsequent aggregation, normalization, and prioritization. Objective 1474  alignments include: 1475  ● Strategic risks related to the implementation of a new service offering; opportunities for 1476  innovation within an ICT area; change management improvements and challenges. 1477  ● Operations issues regarding product or service quality and resilience (e.g., supply chain 1478  interruption that disables a manufacturing process); processes and procedures for privacy 1479  risk posture; operational technology considerations; business continuity/disaster recovery 1480  issues. 1481  ● Reporting regarding ICT risk issues, including insurance considerations and material 1482  risk factors that affect disclosures or statutory reporting. 1483  ● Compliance risks where a negative event might result in a failure to meet a contractual 1484  service agreement or in a regulatory penalty or fine. 1485  Direction may be needed regarding how to account for those risks that cross multiple boundaries 1486  and how each organizational level should perform an aggregation of subordinate risk registers. 1487  4.2 Creating the Enterprise Risk Register (ERR) 1488  Enterprise risk officers collect all risk inputs, including the ICT risk registers, and analyze 1489  potential risk events, consequences, and impacts at the enterprise level to create the ERR. The 1490  ERR is subsequently prioritized to create the enterprise risk profile (ERP) discussed in Section 1491  4.3, which enables key executive stakeholders to stay aware of critical risks, including those that 1492  are ICT-related.  1493  As part of their risk guidance, enterprise leaders designate ERM process participants and the 1494  responsibilities of each role. That guidance should declare which role is responsible for creating 1495  and maintaining the ERR, how frequently it will be updated, and how the risks within it will be 1496  communicated to various stakeholders. This document will assume that role to be assigned to the 1497  NIST SP 800-221 ipd ENTERPRISE IMPACT OF INFORMATION  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  AND COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY RISK  35  enterprise risk officer, although the responsibility could fall upon any designated party, including 1498  other roles as described in Section 3.1.1. 1499  The creation and maintenance of the ERR also supports a periodic review of enterprise risk 1500  guidance, including risk definitions, context, and risk appetite criteria. It provides an opportunity 1501  to review and validate enterprise definitions for risks, risk categories, and risk assessment scales. 1502  If any changes or updates to the risk context or guidance need to occur, the enterprise risk officer 1503  (or equivalent) is likely to have sufficient seniority to ensure appropriate updates to those 1504  enterprise processes. Practitioners should consider any positive risks present in the rolled-up 1505  report and add other opportunities as inputs to the ERR. 1506  Figure 10 provides a notional ERR that combines both federal agency and critical infrastructure 1507  risks, illustrating the integration of various ICT risks alongside other key enterprise risks. 1508  1509  Figure 10: Notional Example of an ICT-Inclusive ERR 1510  NIST SP 800-221 ipd ENTERPRISE IMPACT OF INFORMATION  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  AND COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY RISK  36  This example illustrates the inclusion of a positive risk (item 2) beside negative risks. Of course, 1511  an actual ERR would include many more entries, both positive and negative. Most of the 1512  columns in the example are the same as their lower-level risk register counterparts. The notable 1513  exception is that the example ERR splits the Current Assessment—Impact into three columns, 1514  which are described in Table 7. 1515  Table 7: Descriptions of Additional Notional ERR Elements 1516  ERR Element Description  Current  Assessment— Financial Impact  Analysis of the financial potential benefits or consequences resulting from this scenario,  including cost considerations. While this element could be quantitative, it is often qualitative  (e.g., high, moderate, low) at the enterprise level. Financial considerations may be expressed  as 1) capital expenditures that represent a longer-term business expense, such as property,  facilities, or equipment, and 2) operating expenses that support day-to-day operations.  Current  Assessment— Reputation Impact  Analysis of the potential benefits or consequences that the scenario might have on the  stature, credibility, or effectiveness of the enterprise. Some enterprises perform a formal  sentiment analysis using commercial services or other technical tools to support assessment.  Current  Assessment— Mission Impact  Analysis of the potential benefits or consequences that the scenario might have on the ability  of the enterprise to successfully achieve mission objectives  1517  As was described for lower-level risk registers, there is value in both a single point of reference 1518  (the ERR) and detailed risk information (the RDR). The ERR provides an easily consumed 1519  summary for understanding the risk landscape, while the RDR provides additional information. 1520  The RDR also enables the documentation of additional information, such as historical 1521  information, detailed risk analysis data, and information about individual and organizational 1522  accountability. Additional information for inclusion in an enterprise RDR might include: 1523  ● Detailed risk information (e.g., full risk statement, detailed scenario description, key risk 1524  indicators, enterprise status for this particular risk) 1525  ● Information regarding various risk roles (e.g., risk owner, risk manager, risk approver) 1526  and affected stakeholders 1527  ● Historical timeline information (e.g., last update date, next expected review) 1528  ● Risk analysis information, including the aggregate understanding of threats, 1529  weaknesses/pre-existing conditions, resources affected, and impact 1530  ● Detailed risk response information (e.g., responses implemented, status and results of 1531  previous responses, additional responses planned) 1532  The ERR provides input for those performing enterprise risk oversight, such as an executive risk 1533  committee. By tracking the status of each risk, including the exposure value of each, enterprise 1534  stakeholders can identify the most relevant risks (e.g., a top ten list that may be used to further 1535  inform enterprise risk decisions). Summary reports about the highest-priority risks may be used 1536  to inform stakeholders (e.g., for federal departments and agencies, those in an oversight role such 1537  as Congress, OMB, or GAO) about existing risks, risk responses, and planned activities. 1538  Since it is difficult to compare dissimilar risk exposures, such as employee retention and disaster 1539  recovery, risks are often translated into financial impact and may be further broken down into the 1540  direct cost (i.e., the impact of a given risk on the capital budget and operating expenses), the 1541  NIST SP 800-221 ipd ENTERPRISE IMPACT OF INFORMATION  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  AND COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY RISK  37  financial cost of reputational damage, and direct financial implications of impact on the 1542  enterprise mission. The relative financial impact of each type of risk can provide further input 1543  into risk management prioritization and monitoring decisions for enterprise risk managers. 1544  Reputation exposure can be similarly determined in the ERR (e.g., by the chief risk officer) by 1545  combining high-impact attacks, enterprise sector, and consequences with a histogram (trend) 1546  analysis of stakeholder sentiment (for each stakeholder type). This last action of prioritization 1547  creates the ERP, as discussed in Section 4.3.  1548  For federal agencies, OMB Circular A-123 requires that the enterprise risk register consider both 1549  inherent and residual risk.18 The COSO ERM Framework [COSOERM] further describes these 1550  terms and differentiates between actual residual risk and target (desired) risk: 1551  • “Inherent risk is the risk to an entity in the absence of any direct or focused actions by 1552  management to alter its severity.” 1553  • “Target residual risk is the amount of risk that an entity prefers to assume in the pursuit 1554  of its strategy and business objectives, knowing that management will implement or has 1555  implemented direct or focused actions to alter the severity of the risk.” 1556  • “Actual residual risk is what remains after management has taken action to alter its 1557  severity. Actual residual risk should be equal to or less than the target residual risk.” 1558  OMB A-123 examples reference inherent risk that describes “conditions in the absence of risk 1559  management actions.” There are often likely to be at least some elements that help mitigate risks, 1560  so this publication typically refers to current risk rather than inherent risk when representing a 1561  baseline risk posture. 1562  4.3 Developing the Enterprise Risk Profile (ERP) 1563  As risk information is transmitted up from lower levels of the organization, each level’s risk 1564  register should contain the pertinent information for creating a prioritized risk profile for the 1565  level immediately above it. For example, a subject matter expert in a particular ICT risk 1566  discipline might provide their own prioritization of risks within their discipline, for consideration 1567  by the next level of risk experts.  1568  Subordinate organizations’ impacts may be different, similar, conflicting, overlapping, or 1569  unavailable and must be properly combined by financial and mission analysis at the level 1570  immediately above the reporting organization. While the impacts of ICT risk on various assets 1571  may be determined at lower levels, the overall cash flow and capital implications of all of the 1572  risks can only be normalized and aggregated (and recorded in the ERR) by enterprise fiduciaries 1573  (e.g., CFOs). Similarly, enterprise mission impacts must be aggregated and expressed by those 1574  senior executives most directly accountable to stakeholders. 1575  The ERR informs the ERP once the risks are prioritized at the highest level of the risk 1576  management function in the enterprise, as depicted in Figure 11. The ERP is a subset of carefully 1577  selected risks from the larger ERR.  1578  18  While both Circular A-123 and some COSO documents reference inherent risk, this publication focuses on current risk.  NIST SP 800-221 ipd ENTERPRISE IMPACT OF INFORMATION  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  AND COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY RISK  38  1579  Figure 11: Notional Example of an Enterprise Risk Profile 1580  The ERP reflects assessments of mission, financial, and reputation exposures organized 1581  according to the four enterprise objectives. They may be full-value exposures or modified (and 1582  so noted) by the likelihood assessments of enterprise leaders. At the top enterprise level, ERM 1583  officials have the prerogative to add their own judgment of likelihood and impact as part of the 1584  normalization process, along with other members of the enterprise risk executive function. While 1585  the ERM process helps drive the discussion and calculation of likely risk scenarios, recent 1586  natural disasters have demonstrated that actual consequences can far exceed initial loss 1587  expectations. Enterprise executives should continually observe industry trends and actual 1588  occurrences to readjust likelihood and impact estimations and reserves based on a changing risk 1589  landscape. ERPs should also reflect comparable occurrence incidents and trends for the subject 1590  enterprise and peer organizations. 1591  NIST SP 800-221 ipd ENTERPRISE IMPACT OF INFORMATION  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  AND COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY RISK  39  The ERP supports the governance and management for measuring significant financial, 1592  reputational, and missional impact (consequences). Some enterprises may also use this taxonomy 1593  to support a broader risk breakdown structure (RBS), a topic that may be explored in a future 1594  NIST publication. As shown in Figure 12, considerations include: 1595  ● Financial impact – Various risk scenarios are converted into actual capital and 1596  operational expenses, enabling executive leaders to conduct a fiscally responsible 1597  cost/benefit analysis that considers the recommended strategies for risk response. (These 1598  presentations are equivalent to the financial disclosures in Form 10-Q and Form 10-K 1599  filings to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission [SEC] by commercial public 1600  companies each quarter and for Form 8-K filings as risk incidents occur.) 1601  ● Reputation impact – While subordinate risk registers describe risk scenarios, including 1602  those that may impact reputation, executive leaders record the evaluation of 1603  consequences on the enterprise’s reputation. This also supports consideration of other 1604  downstream impacts, such as financial losses or credit risk, that are likely to result from 1605  damage to reputation. 1606  ● Mission impact – Executive leaders record the evaluation of consequences on the overall 1607  ability for the enterprise to conduct its mission and achieve strategic objectives. (Mission 1608  impact in commercial public enterprises is often expressed in Share Value/Market Cap 1609  and Share Volatility tables, also disclosed in SEC filings and shareholder 1610  communications.) 1611  These three high-level impact considerations are then used in conjunction with other enterprise 1612  risk responses to determine tolerances, allocations, and disclosures commensurate with risk 1613  exposure. 1614  4.4 Translating the ERP to Inform Leadership Decisions 1615  For some organizations, the information from the ERP will need to be provided to senior 1616  managers that have a fiduciary duty to remain aware of and help manage risks. In this way, 1617  enterprise leaders will have the necessary information and opportunity to consider risk exposures 1618  as factors for budgets or corporate balance sheet reporting. Both private-sector and public-sector 1619  enterprises will benefit from the use of this risk register integration process; creation of an ERP 1620  is mandated by OMB Circular A-123 for federal agencies.19 (Section B1 of OMB A-123 refers to 1621  the Agency Risk Profile.) The “primary purpose of a risk profile is to provide analysis of the 1622  19  Enterprise-level treatment, communication, and prioritization are discussed in Section 5 of this document.  Figure 12: Impacts (Consequences) of Enterprise Assets for a Business or Agency  NIST SP 800-221 ipd ENTERPRISE IMPACT OF INFORMATION  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  AND COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY RISK  40  risks an [enterprise] faces toward achieving its strategic objectives arising from its activities and 1623  operations, and to identify appropriate options for addressing significant risks. The risk profile 1624  assists in facilitating a determination around the aggregate level and types of risk that the agency 1625  and its management are willing to assume to achieve its strategic objectives.” This prioritization 1626  is supported by one of COSO’s key principles: “The organization prioritizes risks as a basis for 1627  selecting responses to risks.” [COSOERM] Prioritization helps managers to evaluate the costs 1628  and benefits of allocating resources to mitigate one risk compared to another. 1629  Senior leadership must have actionable information for their decision-making (e.g., during 1630  industry boardroom deliberations and their federal counterparts). Table 8 provides a notional 1631  Enterprise Risk Profile Supplement that reflects a portfolio evaluation of various organizational 1632  risk profiles. This information, having been populated and prioritized, directly informs executive 1633  decision-making. 1634  Table 8: Notional Enterprise Risk Portfolio View for a Private Enterprise 1635  Financial Risk Profile  Current Period Previous Period  Net Revenue Capital Free Cash  Flow Net Revenue Capital Free Cash  Flow  Enterprise  Dept A  Dept B  …  Dept N  Reputation Risk Profile  Current Period Previous Period  Public Regulators Partners Public Regulators Partners  Enterprise  Dept A  Dept B  …  Dept N  Mission Risk Profile  Current Period Previous Period  Product/Service  Capability Philanthropy Share Value Product/Service  Capability Philanthropy Share Value  Enterprise  Dept A  Dept B  …  Dept N  NIST SP 800-221 ipd ENTERPRISE IMPACT OF INFORMATION  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  AND COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY RISK  41  5 Enterprise Strategy for ICT Risk Coordination 1636  As part of their governance responsibilities, executive leaders should establish clear and 1637  actionable risk management guidance based on enterprise mission and business objectives. 1638  Expressing clear expectations regarding ICT risk enables participants at each level of the 1639  enterprise to manage uncertainty to an acceptable level. As the risk landscape evolves, such as 1640  due to technological and environmental changes, enterprise leaders should continually review 1641  and adjust the risk strategy. For example, an enterprise subject to outside regulation is likely to 1642  receive specific guidance regarding updated federal statutes and directives that must be 1643  considered in evaluating acceptable risk. 1644  5.1 Risk Integration and Coordination Activities 1645  Figure 13 provides a simplified illustration of risk integration and coordination activities. Each 1646  enterprise is unique, so enterprise leadership may wish to tailor the approach for their unique 1647  circumstances. For example, while risk appetite statements usually originate from the most 1648  senior leaders, those leaders may choose to delegate the creation of ICT risk appetite statements 1649  to a senior ICT risk official. Readers should note that the processes described are cyclical. Early 1650  iterations may include the definition of terms, strategies, and objectives. Subsequent iterations 1651  may focus on refining those objectives based on previous results, observations of the risk 1652  landscape, and changes within the enterprise. 1653  1654  Figure 13: Illustration of Enterprise Risk Management Integration and Coordination 1655  Table 9 describes the process by which senior leaders express expectations and receive results 1656  about managing ICT risk throughout the enterprise. 1657  NIST SP 800-221 ipd ENTERPRISE IMPACT OF INFORMATION  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  AND COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY RISK  42  Table 9: Inputs and Outputs for ERM Governance and Integrated ICTRM 1658  Activity Point Inputs Outputs  1.

Senior leaders and business managers define risk tolerance 1661  direction that is applied at the system level. System-level practitioners interpret those risk 1662  tolerance statements and apply ICTRM activities to achieve risk management objectives. 1663  Through risk monitoring, results are then reviewed to confirm effectiveness, highlight 1664  opportunities for improvement, and identify important trends that might require organization- or 1665  enterprise-level action. The output of this activity helps improve communication about the 1666  performance, risk trends, and opportunities among all levels. The specific process activities will 1667  be based on the risk management methods applied but will generally include those below.1668  NIST SP 800-221 ipd ENTERPRISE IMPACT OF INFORMATION  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  AND COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY RISK  43  1669  Figure 14: Continuous ERM/ICTRM Interaction20 1670  20  This figure demonstrates select communications, processes, and decisions germane to the risk appetite, risk tolerance, and risk register interactions among the three levels of  an enterprise addressed by this report; it is not intended to be exhaustive.  NIST SP 800-221 ipd ENTERPRISE IMPACT OF INFORMATION  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  AND COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY RISK  44  The activities in Figure 14 are discussed below. Further details are provided later in this section. 1671  Risk Context and Strategy Activities 1672  • Based on the enterprise mission, executives identify the systems and services that 1673  represent “mission/business-critical functions” that are essential to the successful 1674  operation of the enterprise. Based on that list, the executives and senior leaders identify 1675  the enterprise-level assets that enable those functions. Those assets inherit the 1676  criticality/priority of the functions they support. Enterprise assets supporting those 1677  objectives are identified (e.g., through a BIA).21 1678  • As described in the previous section, leaders at Level 1 (enterprise) and Level 2 1679  (organization) define specific and measurable risk appetite and risk tolerance statements 1680  that reinforce enterprise mission objectives and organization goals. 1681  • At Level 3 (system), practitioners interpret criticality/priority direction from leaders, 1682  expressed through risk appetite and risk tolerance statements, to determine the ICT assets, 1683  processes, and activities that support mission-essential delivery operations. System-level 1684  assets are categorized based on the sensitivity and criticality to enterprise operations, in 1685  line with the enterprise-level BIA results. Those in various roles (e.g., system owners, 1686  security officers) work together to derive system-level requirements and record impact 1687  understanding in the system BIA register. 1688  Risk Identification Activities 1689  • The value of each asset of a given system (e.g., information type, technical component, 1690  personnel, service provider) is appraised to determine how critical or sensitive it is to the 1691  operation of the system. Subsequent risk decisions depend on an accurate understanding 1692  of the importance of each resource to the system. 1693  • For each of these components, the practitioner identifies threat sources that might have a 1694  harmful effect and the vulnerabilities or conditions that might enable such an effect. To 1695  complete development of the risk scenario, the practitioner determines the adverse effect 1696  of the threat source exploiting the vulnerable conditions. The scenario is recorded in the 1697  risk register’s Risk Description column. The category for the scenario is recorded in the 1698  Risk Category column based on enterprise criteria to support risk correlation, 1699  aggregation, and reporting. 1700  Risk Analysis Activities 1701  • The practitioner performs risk analysis to determine the likelihood that the threat events 1702  and vulnerable conditions would result in harmful impacts to the system asset. Similarly, 1703  the practitioner analyzes the impact value and calculates the risk exposure using the 1704  methodology defined in the enterprise risk strategy (e.g., as the product of [risk 1705  likelihood] x [risk impact].) The results of these analyses are recorded in the risk 1706  register’s Current Assessment column as “Likelihood,” “Impact,” and “Exposure.” 1707  21  For practitioners integrating cybersecurity with ERM, NIST IR 8286D, Using Business Impact Analysis to Inform Risk  Prioritization and Response provides additional information about the use of BIA. [IR8286D]  NIST SP 800-221 ipd ENTERPRISE IMPACT OF INFORMATION  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  AND COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY RISK  45  Risk Response Activities 1708  • The determined exposure is compared with the risk tolerance. 1709  o If exposure is within risk tolerance limits, the risk may be accepted. 1710  • If exposure exceeds tolerable levels of risk, practitioners can consider whether they can 1711  achieve risk tolerance through other forms of risk response. 1712  o In many cases, controls may be applied to mitigate risk by reducing its likelihood 1713  or impact to a tolerable level. Controls should be implemented with a 1714  corresponding performance scale (i.e., KPI), which is used as the basis for KRIs. 1715  o Risk response may also include risk transfer, also known as risk sharing. For 1716  example, an organization might hire an external organization to process sensitive 1717  transactions (e.g., payment card transactions), thus reducing the likelihood that 1718  such sensitive data would be processed by an in-house system. Another common 1719  risk transfer method involves the use of ICT insurance policies that can help 1720  reduce the economic impact if an adverse event occurs. 1721  o In some cases, it might be determined that the exposure exceeds risk tolerance and 1722  cannot be brought within limits through any combination of mitigation or risk 1723  transfer. In this case, practitioners (e.g., the system owner) may need to work with 1724  Level 2 leaders to revisit the risk tolerance itself. This negotiation presents an 1725  opportunity for the Level 2 and Level 3 managers to determine the best course of 1726  action to refine risk direction in light of mission objectives (e.g., through an 1727  exception process, an adjustment to the risk tolerance statement, or increased 1728  security requirements for the relevant system). In any case, stakeholders will have 1729  applied a proactive approach to balancing risk and value. 1730  o If an unacceptable ICT risk cannot be adequately treated in a cost-effective 1731  manner, that risk must be avoided. Such a condition may require a significant 1732  redesign of the system or service. These circumstances should be rare, and they 1733  highlight the value of risk coordination early in the system engineering process. 1734  Notably, risk avoidance is not the same as ignoring a risk. 1735  5.1.2 Risk Monitoring and Communication Activities 1736  As described in Section 3.6, risk managers throughout the enterprise must be informed about 1737  objectives, results, priorities, and opportunities that result from the risk responses above. A key 1738  purpose of the various risk registers is to enable ongoing monitoring of enterprise risk activities. 1739  Much of that monitoring occurs through observations of performance metrics, including those 1740  that indicate changes in risk (KRIs). KRIs inform organizations whether controls are adequately 1741  addressing risk and whether risks are changing over time. When KRIs fall outside of pre-1742  established thresholds, this indicates that a risk response is beyond acceptable levels. In this case, 1743  organizations should evaluate risks and make any necessary adjustments to controls. Results of 1744  risk activities and decisions are recorded in the risk register. 1745  Table 109 provides several examples of ICT-related risk appetite, risk tolerance, controls, KPIs, 1746  and leading and lagging KRIs. These all help support the Monitor-Evaluate-Adjust (MEA) cycle 1747  depicted in Section 3.6, Figure 8. 1748  NIST SP 800-221 ipd ENTERPRISE IMPACT OF INFORMATION  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  AND COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY RISK  46  Table 10: Notional ICT-Related Examples Supporting the MEA Cycle 1749  It is important for enterprise processes to ensure adequate communication of risk that has been 1750  accepted (and risk that is implicitly accepted, such as through an exception process). A key 1751  purpose of the various risk registers and reporting methods is to ensure that adequate governance 1752  information is available to monitor enterprise risk decisions. 1753  Risk activities may also be informed through the integration of relevant internal and external 1754  audit findings. Significant audit findings often have enterprise-level impacts. However, lower-1755  severity findings may spread through multiple systems to create risk in aggregate if they are not 1756  addressed adequately. The coordination of audit findings may span multiple levels of the 1757  enterprise. For example, as operational teams address shortcomings or system deficiencies at the 1758  system level, key findings might be communicated and tracked by an audit committee 1759  (organization level). As responses to findings occur and are documented (such as through a 1760  corrective action plan), they assist in the planning of subsequent ERM. 1761  The process continues until all ICT assets and processes have been evaluated for risk from 1762  currently understood threats and vulnerabilities. For some enterprises, the composite set of 1763  system risks, responses applied, and other relevant artifacts will be reviewed by a senior official 1764  Example 1 Example 2 Example 3  Risk  Appetite  Mission-critical systems must  be protected from known  cybersecurity vulnerabilities.  In keeping with the enterprise  designation as a data processor,  as described in the GDPR  (European Union General Data  Protection Regulation), all  personal data processed is kept  confidential.  Our customers associate reliability  with our company’s performance,  so outsourced hosting services  must minimize outages for any  customer-facing websites.  Risk  Tolerance  Systems designated as  mission-critical must be  patched against critical  software vulnerabilities  (severity score of 10) within 14  days of discovery.  While there may be some  tolerance for limited low-risk  corporate information  disclosures, there is zero  tolerance for disclosure of PII.  Regional managers may permit  website outages by supply chain  partners, but those must not  exceed two hours and may affect  no more than five percent of  customers.  Controls  • Periodic vulnerability  assessments  • Patch deployment  capabilities  • Authentication method(s)  • PII processing and  transparency policy  • Authority to process PII  • Audit log alerting/evaluation  • Service level agreements  • Redundant provider circuits  • Web load balancers  • Web servers  KPIs • Percentage of vulnerabilities  patched • Days without a loss of PII • Outage time in hours  Leading  KRIs  • Number of computers with  critical vulnerabilities (CVSS  score of 10) that have not  been patched in 10 days  • Failed facility reviews for  unprotected physical records  • Audit log records showing  violation of separation of duty  requirements  • Outages affecting more than five  percent of customers that have  lasted 1.5 hours  • Outages lasting over two hours  and affecting fewer than five  percent of customers  Lagging  KRIs  • Number of computers with  critical vulnerabilities that  have not been patched in 15  days  • One or more violation  indications from data loss  prevention tools  • Current outages affecting more  than five percent of customers  that have lasted more than two  hours  NIST SP 800-221 ipd ENTERPRISE IMPACT OF INFORMATION  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  AND COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY RISK  47  to confirm that risk decisions and risk responses align with risk tolerance and risk appetite 1765  directives.22 1766  Subsequently, risk registers for various risk management disciplines from throughout the 1767  organization level are normalized and aggregated to provide a composite view of the risk posture 1768  and decisions for that organization. As Level 2 managers consider feedback from system-level 1769  risk activities, they may decide to refine risk tolerance levels. It may be that the aggregate risk 1770  across multiple systems represents too great an exposure and needs to be reduced. In other cases, 1771  based on successful risk management results, stakeholders may be able to permit a little more 1772  risk in some areas if such a decision would support mission objectives and potentially save 1773  resources or allow them to be directed to areas that require additional resources to meet expected 1774  risk tolerances. 1775  Similar reviews and refinement occur at Level 1 to support enterprise governance and risk 1776  management decisions. Some types of enterprises may be required to formally disclose risk 1777  factors (e.g., through annual reports), and this aggregate understanding of ICT risks and risk 1778  decisions can support their fiduciary responsibilities. These activities may also help others, such 1779  as Federal Government agencies, to comply with mandatory requirements, such as those 1780  established by OMB. 1781  Interpreting risk tolerance at Level 3, practitioners develop requirements and apply controls to 1782  achieve an acceptable level of risk. This process helps to ensure that risk management occurs in a 1783  cost-effective way. As an example, consider a global retail firm where a system owner of a 1784  customer-facing website will select controls that will ensure adherence to availability service 1785  levels. In deciding which controls to apply, the system owner collaborates with a security team to 1786  consider methods to meet service level objectives. The team can contact the local power utility 1787  supplier to determine electrical availability history and gather other information regarding the 1788  likelihood of a loss of power to the important website. This additional information might help the 1789  system owner decide whether to invest in a backup generator to ensure sufficient power 1790  availability. 1791  Results from previous assessments can be useful for estimating the likelihood of achieving risk 1792  goals in the future. The team would then move to the next risk scenario (e.g., perhaps an internet 1793  service outage) and review the history and reliability of the organization’s telecommunications 1794  provider to ascertain the likelihood and impact of a loss of service. Iterating through each 1795  potential risk, as described in Figure 14, practitioners can develop a risk-based approach to 1796  fulfilling risk management objectives based on risk appetite and risk tolerance. This, in turn, 1797  helps risk practitioners demonstrate how their actions directly support mission objectives and 1798  enterprise success. 1799  22  For Federal Government agencies, much of their ICT is accounted for under what is considered a FISMA system (Federal  Information Security Modernization Act) and thus subject to FISMA privacy and security requirements, so the system  authorization process might represent an example of this cycle.  NIST SP 800-221 ipd ENTERPRISE IMPACT OF INFORMATION  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  AND COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY RISK  48  5.2 Aggregation and Normalization of Risk Registers 1800  The value of using consistent risk registers for ICT uncertainty should now be clear. The precise 1801  contents and format will vary by enterprise but will generally follow the structure that has been 1802  illustrated throughout this publication. 1803  5.2.1 Aggregation of ICT Risk Information 1804  The activities described earlier provide guidance to help complete the risk register for a given 1805  system, using that form to record information about known risk scenarios, analysis of their 1806  impacts, and actual or planned activities to respond to those risks. 1807  Aggregation activities are performed among the hierarchical levels shown previously. System-1808  level risk registers are combined with others from the same lower-level organization (e.g., 1809  business department, branch office, division). In a similar way, the now-combined risk registers 1810  at the organization level (e.g., business unit, government bureau) and enterprise level are 1811  aggregated and normalized. The method for managing the risk ID is up to the practitioner, but a 1812  source identifier might be needed to provide traceability to the original register (e.g., “System A” 1813  risk register ID #1 might be tagged as aggregated risk ID A-1). 1814  5.2.2 Normalization of Risk Register Information 1815  While aggregation is occurring, the ICT risk manager will also be normalizing the information 1816  contained in the various risk registers. As data points are brought together, there will likely be 1817  some risks that occur so infrequently (or are of low enough consequence) that they do not merit 1818  inclusion in the next-level register. Decisions about what to integrate and how to do so depend 1819  on the use of a common risk rating scheme that enables risk assessments to be translated and 1820  integrated at higher enterprise levels. At a minimum, the normalization process at the higher 1821  level (for example, for the ERR) should use the same rating criteria to enable comparison and 1822  tracking. This typically includes definitions for how negative (and positive) consequences and 1823  likelihood are to be measured to allow comparability across assessment results. Risk criteria may 1824  also describe how time factors, such as risk velocity, should be considered in determining the 1825  risk severity. As noted in this publication, risk criteria may consider the organization’s objectives 1826  and internal/external context. Criteria for risk escalation or risk elevation may also be considered 1827  as part of the equation for whether specific ICT risks meet the minimum threshold for enterprise-1828  level discussion. For example, the enterprise may note shared risks that represent a broad threat 1829  that would benefit from centralized risk mitigation or a reputational risk that demands immediate 1830  preventive action. 1831  During normalization, risk managers review the results from the various risk registers to support 1832  consistent risk treatment and communication. Some examples of ICT risk normalization are 1833  described in Table 11. A key element of normalization is the identification and resolution of 1834  cases where a similar risk scenario is treated differently by different enterprise participants. 1835  There may be no issue with such a difference since context and circumstances might be different, 1836  but the underlying cause should be understood, and the disparity should be recognized. 1837  NIST SP 800-221 ipd ENTERPRISE IMPACT OF INFORMATION  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  AND COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY RISK  49  Table 11: Examples of ICT Risk Normalization 1838  De-duplicate and  combine identical or  similar risks  ● An external attacker deploys a remote access tool and uses it to exfiltrate the  plans for the company’s upcoming merger.  ● External threat actors steal information about marketing plans through malicious  code deployed in the sales department.  ● Malicious parties plant a web shell in an external site that enables them to access  documents stored in the Legal Affairs shared document folder, resulting in the loss  of critical corporate information.  Reprioritize according to  risk appetite, tolerance,  and sensibilities  ● Since priorities have been established at organization and system levels, it may  be necessary to review their collective priority and recommend adjustments to a  higher or lower priority.  Resolve risk register  disparities  One of two alternatives might be applied:  ● The combined risk description could be listed in the risk register for each risk  response selected by system owners at lower levels. If two system owners had  mitigated the above exfiltration risk and one had chosen to accept it, then the risk  would appear in the combined risk register twice, with each row indicating the  respective response.  ● The combined ICT risk would be included once in the risk register, with both of the  responses included in the Risk Response Type column.  Adjudicate key risks ● Those risks that warrant tracking and further communication in the ERR are  highlighted and reviewed by enterprise-level risk managers.  The categories of each ICT risk in each register are likely to be limited and consistent, so that 1839  column provides a practical key for the initial sorting exercise. After all of the risks at a given 1840  level are combined, aggregation is a straightforward activity but may require some manual 1841  adjustment. Various risk owners will likely use differing risk descriptions for the same scenario. 1842  The risk manager of that business unit would transliterate these ICT risks into a single 1843  representative risk on the business unit’s risk register, perhaps “External malicious party uses 1844  malicious code to exfiltrate sensitive business-related documents.” In this case, the risk must 1845  describe the type of information that is at risk of theft, since the loss of internal business 1846  documents, patient healthcare records, and employee financial information might each represent 1847  differing likelihoods and impacts. The criteria for delineating these factors will be determined by 1848  each enterprise. For example, if sufficiently detailed risk appetite and risk tolerance statements 1849  have been recorded, they might provide input into those risk criteria. 1850  The activities described in this document are solely intended to support public- and private-1851  sector enterprise information gathering and reporting. Actions for an immediate response, 1852  escalation, or notification for any particular adverse event should be handled through the 1853  enterprise’s incident response processes. Similarly, raw risk information from each risk register 1854  should be fully available for any manager’s review. Aggregated summarization is a valuable 1855  reporting tool but should not impede the ability of managers to review specific risk decisions. 1856  Aggregating the risk analysis from multiple risk registers will vary by enterprise, but, for 1857  example, a three-point estimation could be used to complete the likelihood and impact columns 1858  on the combined register. The business unit risk manager could calculate these values using the 1859  lowest observed value as the best case, the highest value as the worst case, and the mean value of 1860  the others as the most likely. That manager could also apply their knowledge of the personnel 1861  and processes used to generate the risk registers, such that, if they know that a particularly 1862  NIST SP 800-221 ipd ENTERPRISE IMPACT OF INFORMATION  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  AND COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY RISK  50  detailed study had been performed to develop one or more of the estimates, that might influence 1863  the understanding of the most likely value. 1864  5.2.3 Integrating Risk Register Details 1865  For some enterprises, aggregation of these risk analysis and risk response values may be more art 1866  than science. Some organizations have skilled practitioners with actuarial experience who can 1867  statistically aggregate multiple data points and draw a scientific conclusion about the likelihood 1868  and impact (and therefore exposure rating) of various risks. Other organizations will simply work 1869  to normalize a list of highs and lows, with risk managers using their best judgment to estimate 1870  the combined exposure. Because the process of analyzing and responding to risk factors is highly 1871  iterative, an enterprise might need to begin with qualitative risk values and identify opportunities 1872  to increasingly apply quantitative approaches as more information and history become available. 1873  Information sharing and communications on risk response is vital as risk response could be 1874  ongoing, iterative, or span different reporting cycles. The information provides valuable data that 1875  will guide enterprise-level risk decisions, but the level of precision needed at higher hierarchical 1876  levels will likely be less than is needed at the system level. 1877  Completion of the remaining columns presents opportunities for enterprise determination as 1878  follows: 1879  • For an aggregation of the risk response cost column, in some cases, an organization-level 1880  risk manager may wish to record a statistically weighted average of the risk response 1881  costs. In other cases, the manager may wish to provide a total cost allocated across all 1882  subsidiary systems and organizations. 1883  • The column for risk owner should indicate an organization-level representative who has 1884  the accountability and authority to manage that risk. Risk ownership is a key information 1885  point that must be carefully considered and applied. The party designated as the risk 1886  owner must be continually knowledgeable about relevant risk conditions and must also 1887  have the accountability and authority to manage the risk. Since risk conditions may 1888  change as information is aggregated, responsibility and accountability should be 1889  periodically reviewed to ensure that the risk owner is the appropriate designee. 1890  • The risk status for each aggregated ICT risk should use a consistent set of indicators. 1891  Status could be a simple indicator (e.g., open, closed, pending) or provide a more detailed 1892  explanation (e.g., “Risk accepted pending review by the Jan. 24 quarterly risk committee 1893  meeting”). 1894  While the methods and algorithms used will vary by enterprise, there should be a consistent risk 1895  aggregation strategy that is expressed as part of a policy within a given enterprise. Given the roll-1896  up process, ICTRM – working in conjunction with enterprise risk managers – can include 1897  relevant risk policy statements, including requirements for registering risks, providing updates 1898  regularly, and communicating risk activities with enterprise managers and leadership. 1899  Through these procedures and policy statements, the various ICT risks are integrated into a 1900  comprehensive ERR. Note that the processes are described as a bottom-up integration, but real-1901  NIST SP 800-221 ipd ENTERPRISE IMPACT OF INFORMATION  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  AND COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY RISK  51  world scenarios are likely to be interactive and iterative. Integration is important for gathering 1902  data and provides opportunities for analysis and adjustment. 1903  5.3 Adjusting Risk Responses 1904  Based on the evaluation, risk managers adjust their risk response approach. In some cases, the 1905  evaluation will provide evidence that risk response has been effective and is efficiently achieving 1906  the necessary level of risk treatment. In other cases, adjustments may be necessary to risk 1907  direction, risk treatment, or both. 1908  Aristotle is commonly credited with teaching that the whole is not the same as the sum of its 1909  parts. Such an observation highlights that the composite set of enterprise risk likelihood and 1910  impact is something besides and not necessarily equivalent to the sum of the risk analyses 1911  described in the various risk registers. 1912  As controls are applied throughout the enterprise, and as indicators are produced (and reported 1913  through metrics), various managers and leaders will consider the evaluation produced in the 1914  previous section. Given the resulting observations, several adjustments may be warranted, as 1915  described below. 1916  • Adjust strategic direction – Based on collective results, senior leaders may update risk 1917  appetite statements to increase or decrease risk limits, including potentially adjusting 1918  specific quantitative direction. In addition to or in place of risk appetite adjustment, risk 1919  tolerance interpretation may similarly be adjusted to take advantage of opportunities or to 1920  reduce the likelihood or impact of harmful risks. 1921  • Adjust risk responses – To address inconsistent responses to risks or to achieve a 1922  different result, leaders may choose to direct specific response actions to one or more risk 1923  scenarios. For example, if some organizations decided to mitigate a given risk type and 1924  others chose to accept it, risk managers may clarify which treatment is the appropriate 1925  response (or clarify the criteria by which that decision is made). As with previous 1926  discussions, this adjustment may either be to reduce the overall exposure by enacting a 1927  more stringent response, or to loosen restrictions to gain some advantage in exchange for 1928  a measured risk increase. Such changes may occur gradually to ensure sufficient ICTRM 1929  at all hierarchical levels. 1930  • Adjust KPIs and KRIs – While the enterprise may adjust its specific direction or 1931  treatment of risk, the result of the evaluation will often be increased monitoring of the 1932  various conditions. Especially when conditions indicate broad variance in resulting 1933  metrics, managers may direct changes to the KPIs and KRIs that are monitored to gain 1934  better visibility. If changes to impact and likelihood cannot be adequately observed with 1935  the current indicators, then different (or additional) metrics may be justified. Increased 1936  frequency is indicated when impact and likelihood change more rapidly than the current 1937  monitoring interval. 1938  The adjustments described are intended to provide improvements that are directly based on the 1939  observations resulting from monitoring and evaluating risk results. Additional adjustments may 1940  be based on external direction, such as requirements by a regulator for increased risk 1941  NIST SP 800-221 ipd ENTERPRISE IMPACT OF INFORMATION  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  AND COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY RISK  52  management or new reporting criteria (e.g., prohibiting sharing or disclosing information from a 1942  smart utility meter about a customer’s usage without that customer’s consent). 1943  5.3.1 Factors Influencing Prioritization 1944  Numerous factors (e.g., financial loss, enterprise reputation, shareholder sentiment) influence 1945  priority and should be included in the enterprise risk strategy. An ICT risk that directly impacts 1946  the mission is likely to be a high priority, but many other considerations – such as agency or 1947  corporate reputation – may move a particular type of risk to the top of the list. Another 1948  consideration could occur if a corporate entity was preparing for a merger. The community has 1949  seen recent examples that have demonstrated that the discovery of an ICT risk can affect the 1950  valuation of an enterprise and subsequent negotiations. There may also be factors that are not 1951  directly related to risk but that could support organizational improvement (e.g., quick wins that 1952  build team confidence and gain momentum, risks related to an objective that leaders have 1953  established as a key priority). Priority values such as low, moderate, and high are often used as 1954  risk prioritization categories. This qualitative approach may be more limiting than quantitative 1955  analysis in that it is easier to sort a range of numerical values – even those that are relatively 1956  close – than it is to sort a list of risks marked “Very High.” In most enterprises, risk strategy 1957  should provide direction for both generalization (e.g., low, moderate, high) and more specific 1958  risk prioritization methods. 1959  5.3.2 ICT Risk Optimization 1960  A key goal of ERM/ICTRM coordination is to help enterprise stakeholders collect various risk 1961  data for decision support, monitoring, and communications. Several foundational definitions are 1962  relevant to properly prioritizing risk at each stage of the life cycle, including aggregating and 1963  prioritizing the risk register data discussed in this document: 1964  • Risk aggregation – The combination of several risks into one risk to develop a more 1965  complete understanding of the overall risk [ISO73]. 1966  • Risk criteria – Terms of reference against which the significance of a risk is evaluated, 1967  such as organizational objectives, internal/external context, and mandatory requirements 1968  (e.g., standards, laws, policies) [ISO73]. 1969  • Risk optimization – A risk-related process to minimize negative and maximize positive 1970  consequences and their respective probabilities; risk optimization depends on risk 1971  criteria, including costs and legal requirements. 1972  The processes to aggregate, prioritize, and optimize risk will be different at each level of the 1973  enterprise, based on the risk criteria relevant to that level. At hierarchically lower levels in an 1974  enterprise, a certain amount of risk prioritization and treatment authority will have been 1975  delegated by the stated risk strategy guidance to streamline operations, but there might need to be 1976  additional collaboration based on observations by those performing oversight at higher levels. 1977  The methods used for optimizing risk are at the discretion of enterprise leaders and are often 1978  carried out by a risk leadership council or other risk governance body. Since capital and 1979  operating expense budgets for risk response are likely to be limited, each method must include a 1980  NIST SP 800-221 ipd ENTERPRISE IMPACT OF INFORMATION  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  AND COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY RISK  53  process for how to respond to those scenarios when funding is not available. Some examples 1981  include: 1982  • Fiscal optimization – A straightforward ranking of risks in descending order from most 1983  impactful to least. Risk managers tally the total risk response costs until funding is 1984  exhausted. 1985  • Algorithmic optimization – The application of mathematical formulas to calculate the 1986  aggregate cost-benefit to the enterprise, given the estimated costs, in a purely mechanical 1987  approach. 1988  • Operational optimization – The selection of those risks from the register that are most 1989  important to operations (based on leadership preferences, mission objectives, and 1990  stakeholder sentiment. Operational coordination depends upon an iterative 1991  communications cycle of risk reporting and analytics. 1992  • Forced ranking optimization – Prioritizing risks in the way that will best use available 1993  resources to achieve the maximum benefit, given specific negative and positive 1994  consequences. Various business drivers and risk consequences have differing weights for 1995  developing a score, helping to move beyond the simplistic “threat multiplied by 1996  vulnerability” approach to build business objectives into that equation. Because these 1997  factors and their weights are based on business drivers, the factors should be defined by 1998  senior stakeholders but can be applied at all levels of the enterprise, subject to adjustment 1999  and refinement. Notably, while forced ranking is often the default method of 2000  optimization, the methods above are equally valid and beneficial to the enterprise. 2001  Ultimately, the optimization performed will likely be some combination of these methods. For 2002  some enterprises, risk optimization may also have a temporal factor. For example, risk owners 2003  might be willing to accept some risk scenarios to reduce expenses and boost profitability near the 2004  end of a fiscal quarter. Those same scenarios might be fully treated in more favorable financial 2005  circumstances. The goal of this report is not to advocate for any particular optimization process 2006  but rather to determine how optimization and prioritization will occur, since these decisions must 2007  precede risk response itself. 2008  Keep in mind that these management processes are iterative. Generally speaking, as risk 2009  information is aggregated throughout the enterprise, more information becomes available about 2010  risk commonalities. As risk managers observe similar types of positive and negative risk events, 2011  they can note contributing factors, highlight common opportunities, and gain a broader 2012  understanding of risk conditions. Because leaders and executives often have a broader view of 2013  factors that contribute to and result from various risks, including ICT risks, they can provide 2014  additional criteria to hierarchically lower levels to help sort and prioritize. 2015  5.3.3 ICT Risk Priorities at Each Enterprise Level 2016  In support of risk prioritization, as with ICT risks themselves, the ranking factors reflect the 2017  various strata of the enterprise. At the system level, the risk register reflects risk priorities related 2018  to particular systems and technologies. The organization level has priorities based on unique 2019  mission and business unit drivers. The enterprise has overarching ICT priorities that may not be 2020  the same as those at lower technical levels of abstraction, and they can be of varying priority 2021  NIST SP 800-221 ipd ENTERPRISE IMPACT OF INFORMATION  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  AND COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY RISK  54  when considered along with other enterprise risks. This balance is foundational to the concept 2022  of ICTRM as an input to ERM. While risks to institutional information and technology are 2023  critical parts of the enterprise and a primary focus of those charged with leading ICTRM, 2024  corporate officers and fiduciaries have a broad perspective and must balance the dozens of types 2025  of uncertainty in the enterprise risk universe. Bidirectional communication is critical, enabling 2026  senior leaders to convey strategy and direction while also enabling the system- and business-2027  level managers to keep leadership informed.  2028  This process does not mean that every system-level risk decision should be elevated to top 2029  leadership, but rather that many risk decisions at the system and organization levels should be 2030  considered provisional and that leaders may subsequently recommend a different priority or 2031  approach based on their understanding of the aggregate impact to enterprise factors (e.g., 2032  revenue, reputation, regulations, political). 2033  5.4 Enterprise Adjustments Based on ICT Risk Results 2034  In many organizations, ICT enables a flexible approach to achieving the enterprise mission and 2035  ensuring stakeholder value. ICT aspects evolve rapidly, as does the ICT risk landscape, so 2036  periodic adjustments to ICTRM are likely to be needed. The Federal Government has observed 2037  that additional technical capabilities are often needed to provide better services to citizens even 2038  as agencies recognize the increased risk presented by the underlying technology. Budgets may 2039  need to be allocated for this emerging technology, and strict guidance on how to manage risk to 2040  that ICT may be provided. Subsequently, results of previous iterations of the ICTRM cycle may 2041  support management decisions to adjust funding and risk parameters to achieve enterprise 2042  objectives. 2043  5.4.1 Adjustments to ICT Program Budget Allocation 2044  In both public- and private-sector enterprises, resource considerations are often described as a 2045  contributing factor for risk. To some extent, the claim that a program “needs more resources” is 2046  justifiable in that there are always more tools, personnel, and services that could be added. 2047  However, effective ICTRM requires a balance among risk optimization, resource optimization, 2048  and the value delivered by the technology being used to support mission objectives. If any of 2049  these three factors results in an imbalance, the solution is untenable. ICTRM informs the 2050  decisions around what areas receive priority within limited budget environments. 2051  The factors that have been discussed thus far can help in evaluating the extent to which the 2052  risk/resource balance is well-tuned. For example, because risk decisions are based on stakeholder 2053  needs (and the resulting enterprise and alignment objectives), ICT activities can be traced back to 2054  mission and business value. 2055  In theory, one can simply build a business case that demonstrates the value proposition of 2056  investment in ICT protection, detection, and response resources. In reality, it can be quite 2057  challenging to directly report the subsequent return on that investment. One way to address this 2058  challenge is by applying detailed risk assessment and reporting activities, such as those described 2059  in this document. Quantitative methods provide specific calculations that enable the risk 2060  practitioner to simulate risk likelihood and financial impact before and after implementation of 2061  NIST SP 800-221 ipd ENTERPRISE IMPACT OF INFORMATION  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  AND COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY RISK  55  the ICT improvement. This then drives a straightforward cost-benefit analysis regarding the 2062  resource investment. 2063  Another budgetary consideration results from the aggregation activities described above. As 2064  managers and leaders review the activities performed and the risk results provided, they may 2065  identify opportunities to centrally fund and operate risk management activities that had 2066  previously been the responsibility of individual system owners. It might make fiscal sense to 2067  combine particular activities to gain efficiencies or reduce duplication. As such opportunities 2068  become apparent during the review of risk register reports and results, leaders may make fiscal 2069  adjustments to gain an advantage. 2070  5.4.2 Adjustments to Risk Appetite and Risk Tolerance 2071  In addition to fiscal considerations, observations during the life cycle may also provide feedback 2072  regarding leaders’ risk criteria regarding risk appetite and tolerance. Figure 14 illustrates several 2073  key decision points, including: 2074  • Risk acceptance at the system level – in selecting the appropriate controls for a given 2075  information system (or shared set of controls), is a risk already acceptable, given the 2076  applicable risk tolerance statements? 2077  o If it is not acceptable, the system owner has the option of applying additional risk 2078  response, either through risk sharing or through mitigation by various controls. 2079  o At times, risk cannot be brought within tolerance through any combination of 2080  controls, or the cost of the controls might be unreasonable for the system. In such 2081  a case, it is possible that there might be limited ability to adjust risk tolerance. In 2082  either case, discussion with decision makers is necessary to determine the 2083  appropriate course of action. That discussion might also support guidance for 2084  other enterprise systems facing similar risk scenarios. 2085  • Additional decision points occur after the aggregation and integration of risk registers at 2086  various levels. As risk managers review the risk registers and RDRs, risk management 2087  results will be compared with stakeholder expectations. Based on the aggregated results, 2088  ICT risk managers might need to consider the following questions: 2089  o Is risk response consistent across various organizational structures and levels? 2090  Based on risk analysis, response, and monitoring results, risk managers may 2091  determine that additional guidance is needed to better achieve repeatable and 2092  reliable risk management activity. Adjustments in policy, procedure, staff 2093  training, and other governance components may be necessary to improve process 2094  maturity. 2095  o Has the risk environment evolved (perhaps due to changes in internal or external 2096  context, such as new regulations or customer agreements) to such an extent that 2097  risk direction or criteria need to be adjusted? If so, this provides an opportunity to 2098  repeat the cycle. 2099  In addition to these programmatic adjustments, specific risk treatment adjustments might be 2100  identified during continuous monitoring and ongoing assessment activities. 2101  NIST SP 800-221 ipd ENTERPRISE IMPACT OF INFORMATION  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  AND COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY RISK  56  5.4.3 Reviewing Whether Constraints Are Overly Stringent 2102  A challenge for senior managers is ensuring that their organizations are permitting enough risk, 2103  especially those risks that help realize benefits (e.g., opportunities, rewards). These introspective 2104  questions help those in risk governance roles identify whether their risk managers are using the 2105  risk governance tools and processes correctly or if those tools and processes need adjustment. 2106  It is rare that an opportunity can be realized without a negative risk. One might also question 2107  why anyone would embark on a circumstance that results in a negative risk without a 2108  corresponding opportunity that makes such an endeavor worthwhile. A basic objective of risk 2109  management programs is to identify individual negative risks so that they can be matched to their 2110  corresponding positive risks, enabling tradeoff analysis. With individual negative risks 2111  identified, the risk program is prepared to move ahead with a risk response should the tradeoff 2112  analysis render a decision to proceed with the positive risk. 2113  5.4.4 Adjustments to Priority 2114  A final program-level adjustment relates to enterprise priorities. ICT risk decisions flow from the 2115  enterprise mission and priorities. This is illustrated by Activity Point 1 in Figure 13 where senior 2116  leaders establish the mission and priorities, which drive strategic objectives and planning, which 2117  are then used to direct ICTRM activities. Subsequently, identified and assessed risks are 2118  recorded in the risk register in accordance with those priorities. The order in which risks are 2119  addressed, the direction of appropriate response, and even the agreement about which risks will 2120  be addressed all derive from the enterprise priorities. For this reason, a key enterprise activity 2121  will be a periodic review of those priorities and the effects that they have on ICTRM. Based on 2122  the results of such reviews, priorities might be adjusted or clarified to ensure continued 2123  alignment between ICTRM activity and mission objectives. 2124  NIST SP 800-221 ipd ENTERPRISE IMPACT OF INFORMATION  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  AND COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY RISK  57  References 2125  [COSOERM] Committee of Sponsoring Organizations (COSO) of the Treadway  Commission (2017) Enterprise Risk Management—Integrating with  Strategy and Performance, Executive Summary.

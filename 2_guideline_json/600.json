ENISA  aims to provide an evidence-based methodology for establishing a National-level Risk Assessment in  order to contribute to the wider objective of improving national contingency planning practices  (NCPs)1. This report will help towards rationalising national risk assessments in EU Member States in  order to reduce or eliminate vulnerabilities of critical Information and Communication Technology  (ICT) services and infrastructures. This objective was articulated in the February 2013 European  Cyber Security Strategy and thus sits within broader EU-wide efforts to improve crisis cooperation  activities.  This report should be of use to policy-makers who are charged with implementing a CIIP or cyber  security risk assessment programme. In addition, other interested parties may include regulators,  researchers and senior industry representatives from Critical Information Infrastructure sectors.  In this study we have analysed current National-level Risk Assessment practices in around twenty  countries and tried capture the main aspects of the implementation of their National-level Risk  Assessments. Which of these aspects are most effective in a particular country depends to a certain  extent on important administrative, economic, legal and cultural factors such as the dependence of  society on cyberspace; the way in which government activities are conducted and the pre-existing  state of the art in information security risk management. It is also important that National-level Risk  Assessment programmes should be linked to a national cyber security strategy. A high-level cyber  security strategy, clearly owned, can provide the context and ultimate rationale for a National-level  Risk Assessment programme.  There are a number of permutations or variations in National-level Risk Assessment which may be  implemented depending on the specific context of the country. Such possible options have been  listed in this report, with clear guidelines for National-level Risk Assessment programme manager on  how to identify these local specificities and requirements.  Regarding the identification of threats and modelling we have found that the most important are:   articulated in a high-level strategy,   based on scenarios,   described qualitatively or quantitatively.  Concerning approaches to the conduct of a National-level Risk Assessment, they can be performed:   through a formalised central framework or approach (a one-size-fits-all), or   based on a decentralised model where each actor prepares their own risk assessment to be  integrated by a coordinating authority.  Finally, national-level risk management methodologies may be based upon:   Scenario-based approaches where actors are gathered together to consider scenarios in the  round; such scenarios describe risks as a narrative and label them by applying simple  categories of likelihood and impact (low, medium, high),   Quantitative approaches which apply ordinal thresholds (e.g. a risk is classed severe if it  affects 1 in 20,000), or   Approaches which combine elements of all of the above (for example, using scenarios and  then qualitative and quantitative methods).  1  For more on this topic see ENISA’s Guide for National Contingency Plans: http://www.enisa.europa.eu/c3e/national-  contingency-plans  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/c3e/national-contingency-plans http://www.enisa.europa.eu/c3e/national-contingency-plans  National-level Risk Assessments  An Analysis Report  November 2013  Page  iv  Key challenges  We have identified a number of key challenges for National-level Risk Assessment programmes,  including:   The lack of a harmonised national framework for cyber security, particularly with regard to  terminology;   Incomplete and diverse risk assessment methodologies (especially in the pan-European  context);   The lack of comprehensive methods to address threats;   The need for effective risk management and preparedness capacity and skills;   The need for more information sharing between different actors involved in a National-level  Risk Assessment  Common lessons  The lessons learned are grouped into the following areas:   The need to leverage international best practice, as many countries had visited others to  learn about risk analysis practices;   The importance of establishing effective collaboration between the public and private  sectors, especially where in some cases the private sector owns considerable parts of the  infrastructure;   Finally, the need for effective critical information infrastructure approaches to be tailored to  each national context.  Current priorities of National-level Risk Assessment programmes  Countries reported that they were focusing upon a number of priorities in the near to medium term,  including the following:   Improving understanding of threats and their effects upon society;   Better incident management;   Greater stakeholder involvement and information sharing;   Improved national CIIP frameworks;   Seeking further EU guidance and support.  In conclusion we can see that understanding of the national approach to cyber security and how risk  decisions are taken in different countries is important to ensure that the results of any National-level  Risk Assessment reach key decision-makers at the right time. It is also clear that there are a variety  of approaches and levels of sophistication used in National-level Risk Assessments. Qualitative tools  appeared to be preferred due to the complexities of understanding risk in the cyber domain.  Depending on the preconditions regarding implementation, risk assessment could be performed  using a common set of methods or in a more decentralised fashion. Challenges included the  diversity of methodologies and approaches to National-level Risk Assessments (which highlights the  need for this guidance document) as well as the complexities of public–private cooperation. As  might be expected, many countries studied drew lessons from others when preparing their National- level Risk Assessment programmes. Some countries had identified priorities that they were seeking  to focus on, including greater understanding of threats, improved stakeholder engagement and  better national CIIP frameworks.  Recommendations  Based on an analysis of the data gathered we recommend the following:  1. Member States should understand better the underlying cyber threats and risks that they  face and the impact to society.  2. Member States are advised to integrate National-level Risk Assessment into the lifecycle of  NIS incident management and cooperation plans and procedures.  National-level Risk Assessments  An Analysis Report  November 2013  Page  v  3. Member States should expand public–private sector dialogue and information sharing.  4. A practical step-by-step guide on how to perform National-level Risk Assessments should be  developed, tested and maintained. Such a guide should be piloted by countries at the early  stages of preparing their own National-level Risk Assessment programme. ENISA or another  international institution would be appropriate bodies to oversee this action.  5. A catalogue of scenarios to help Member States in their National-level Risk Assessments  should be established at EU level. Such a catalogue could be based on work already being  done at ENISA on the threat landscape2 and incident reporting3.  6. The EU community of practitioners with an interest in cyber National-level Risk Assessments  should be established and strengthened as information exchange platform, e.g., within the  framework of the European Commission’s NIS Platform4.  7. Risk analysis expertise must be shared from other domains that assess complex cross-border  risks, such as border security, financial services, aviation or public health for example within  the European Commission’s NIS Platform and other activities organised by ENISA.  2  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/risk-management/evolving-threat-environment  3  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/Incidents-reporting  4  http://ec.europa.eu/digital-agenda/en/news/nis-platform-kick-meeting-working-groups  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/risk-management/evolving-threat-environment http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/Incidents-reporting http://ec.europa.eu/digital-agenda/en/news/nis-platform-kick-meeting-working-groups  National-level Risk Assessments  An Analysis Report  November 2013  Page  vi  Table of Contents  Executive summary iii  1 Introduction 1  1.1 Purpose of this report 1  1.1.1 Target audience 1  1.1.2 About this document 1  1.2 Understanding risk assessment – terminology 2  1.3 About risk assessment 2  1.3.1 Strategic challenges in conducting risk assessments in general 2  1.3.2 Important operational questions specific to CII risk assessments 3  1.4 Methodology 3  1.4.1 Overview of methodology 3  2 Context 1  2.1 Policy impetus in Europe 1  2.1.1 The role of National Contingency Plans 2  2.1.2 National policy initiatives 5  2.1.3 Examples of international initiatives on risk assessment for cyber security 5  2.2 The role of ENISA 6  3 Summary of Findings 7  3.1 Existing guidance on Risk Assessment 7  3.2 National context for cyber security 8  3.2.1 Countries having a National Cyber Security Strategy 9  3.2.2 Organisations with a mandate to address cyber security and /or CIIP 9  3.2.3 Other actors in cyber security collaboration 10  3.2.4 Examples of coordination among different actors in the cyber security arena 11  3.2.5 The decentralised National-level Risk Assessment approach 12  3.2.6 Conclusions regarding the national context for cyber security 13  3.3 Overview of findings relating to National-level Risk Assessment programmes 13  3.4 Approaches to threat modelling 15  3.4.1 Terminology in threat modelling 15  3.4.2 Threats addressed in national security strategies 15  3.4.3 Scenario-based approaches 15  3.4.4 Quantitative approaches 16  3.4.5 Qualitative approaches 16  3.4.6 Threat modelling under development 16  3.4.7 Conclusions for threat modelling 17  National-level Risk Assessments  An Analysis Report  November 2013  Page  vii  3.5 Approaches to Risk Assessment 17  3.5.1 RA strategy 17  3.5.2 Decentralised RA 18  3.5.3 Conclusions for approaches to Risk Assessment 19  3.6 National-level RA methodologies in use 19  3.6.1 Scenario-based approach 19  3.6.2 Combination of different approaches 20  3.6.3 Other approaches and work in progress 21  3.6.4 Conclusions for methodologies used 21  3.7 Key challenges from national experiences 21  3.7.1 Lack of harmonised legal framework for cyber security 22  3.7.2 Incomplete and diverse risk assessment methodologies 22  3.7.3 Lack of comprehensive methods to assess threats 22  3.7.4 Need for effective risk management and preparedness capacity and skills 22  3.7.5 Information sharing 23  3.7.6 Conclusions on key challenges from national experiences 23  3.8 Lessons identified by respondents 23  3.8.1 Assimilating best practices and learning from international cooperation 23  3.8.2 Relationships with the public and private sector 24  3.8.3 Context-specific emergency responses and CI protection approaches 24  3.8.4 Conclusions on lessons learnt 24  3.9 Suggestions from Member States for National-level Risk Assessment development 24  3.9.1 Greater understanding of threats and their effects on society 25  3.9.2 Better management of incidents 25  3.9.3 Greater stakeholder involvement and information sharing 25  3.9.4 Improved national CIIP frameworks 25  3.9.5 EU guidelines and support 25  3.9.6 Conclusions on reported national-level priorities for National-level Risk Assessment programmes 25  4 Conclusions and recommendations 27  4.1 Conclusions 27  4.2 Recommendations 27  Bibliography and further reading 30  List of Acronyms 33  Annex A: List of organisations involved in the study 35  Annex B: Key Informant Interview Protocol 36  Annex C: Questionnaire 38  National-level Risk Assessments  An Analysis Report  November 2013  Page  1  1 Introduction  The capacity to manage crises is a fundamental element of good governance, as it tests  governments' capacity to provide the right responses at the right time to protect their  citizens and businesses and mitigate the impact of disasters.5  Effective risk assessment methodologies are the cornerstone of a successful Critical  Infrastructure Protection programme.6  This chapter introduces the topic of risk assessment and provides a rationale for why this guidance is  required.  We lay out some broad challenges associated with the areas of threat modelling and risk assessment  as they relate to a wider range of efforts to strengthen Member States’ activities on cyber7 crisis  management and cooperation, cyber contingency planning, cyber exercises and – more specifically –  the role that National-level Risk Assessments play in mitigating and reducing Critical Information  Infrastructure (CII) vulnerabilities. Although threats and impact are important, in the context of risks,  but also there are some other ones like: asset identification, assets valuation, risk prioritization,  scope of the assessment, assumptions made, experience from incidents, protection level from  current controls, gap analysis, risk appetite, etc. These are the main grounds for diversification in risk  assessments.  Risk assessment and management in particular is important to prevent, as well as manage, crises  since it lays the groundwork for effective crisis response. Undertaking risk analysis prior to a major  incident that might lead to a crisis makes it more likely that the response will be effective and  efficient.  1.1 Purpose of this report  This document is an Analysis Report containing the core evidence base from a study to understand  the practice of National-level Risk Assessments in different countries. The document is accompanied  by a Step-by-Step Guide on how to perform National-level Risk Assessment that contains more  practical guidance intended for implementation. These two documents are thus complementary: the  analysis report contains essential background information necessary to understand the context prior  to engaging on practical implementation using the Step-by-Step Guide. Target audience  This report is of use to policy-makers at national and international levels who are charged with  implementing a CIIP or cyber security risk assessment programme. Other interested parties may  include regulators, researchers and senior industry representatives from Critical Information  Infrastructure sectors.  1.1.2 About this document  Chapter 1 introduces the topic and provides a rationale for why this guidance is required.  5 Opening remarks by OECD Deputy Secretary-General Yves Leterme at the Joint OECD–Swiss federal Chancellery Workshop on Inter-Agency  Crisis Management 28 June 2012, Geneva, Switzerland available at  http://www.oecd.org/governance/risk/Speech%20DSG%20Leterme%20-final.pdf  6 Giannopoulos G, Filippini, R and Schimmer, M (2012) Risk assessment methodologies for Critical Infrastructure Protection. Part 1: a State  of the Art JRC Technical Notes EUR 25286 EN-2012 Ispra, Italy  7 The World Economic Forum defines ‘cyber’ as referring to the interdependent network of information technology infrastructures, and  includes technologies such as the Internet, telecommunications networks, computer systems, and embedded processors and controllers in  critical industries (WEF 2012).  National-level Risk Assessments  An Analysis Report  November 2013  Page  2  Chapter 2 provides an overview of the context including the policy landscape and guidance  developed by ENISA in the context of National-level Risk Assessments.  Chapter 3 presents a detailed summary of the findings.  Chapter 4 provides some conclusion and recommendations.  This is followed by an extensive bibliography and list of acronyms used in the report.  Appendices contain a list of participating countries, the questionnaire and Key Informant Interview  (KII) protocol used in the study.  1.2 Understanding risk assessment – terminology  ‘Risk’ is usually defined as the potential that a given threat will exploit vulnerabilities of an asset or  group of assets and thereby cause harm to the organization8. Haimes (2004) defines ‘risk’ as a  ‘measure of the probability and severity of adverse effects’ and notes that it is difficult to  comprehend because:  it is a complex composition and amalgamation of two components – one real (potential  damage or unfavourable adverse effects and consequences), the other an imagined  mathematical human construct termed probability.  Figure 1: Risk definitions 9  The following definitional questions , raised by Willis, should be answered prior to embarking upon a  risk assessment:   Security – how broadly is security defined? Does it relate to national security or a wider  interpretation perhaps including safety (e.g. energy security)?   Threat – does the threat model define directed threats (e.g. including a classification of  different adversaries or agents such as organised criminal groups, nation-states etc.) or non- directed threats (e.g. accidents, hardware or software failures)? Does it include systemic  concerns such as natural disasters? How dynamic is the threat model?  8 ISO/IEC 13335-1:2004 Information technology -- Security techniques -- Management of information and communications technology  security -- Part 1: Concepts and models for information and communications technology security management  9  Based on Willis 2007.  National-level Risk Assessments  An Analysis Report  November 2013  Page  2   Vulnerability – what characteristics of the domain, asset or infrastructure are vulnerable or  provide opportunities for the realisation of risk?   Impact – is impact defined in primary or secondary approaches? For example, would it cover  the long-term secondary consequences of the realisation of a risk or the consequences of  aversion measures?   Asset definition – what are the approaches used to identify the critical assets, required for  an organisation’s operations and their continuity, including Information resources that  support the organization's mission?   Likelihood – what are the approaches used to measure the probability that a specific event  will occur?  Will this model incorporate uncertainty?  A distinction is often made between risk analysis (or risk assessment) and risk management (i.e. the  implementation of measures to address the risk identified, which might be to avoid, reduce, share or  retain the risks) (Dorfman 2007).  Definitions used in a particular risk assessment will need to take into account that, from an  operational perspective, it may be possible to significantly reduce a risk (rendering the chances of it  occurring infinitesimally small), but that statistically it may not be possible to eliminate it entirely.  1.3 About risk assessment  During our research on risk assessment, both in the context of studies into risk generally and those  focusing on national security, we have identified four main issues that are applicable to CII risks:   Risk assessment is designed to increase awareness of the different kinds of risks that may  have an impact on CII specifically and national and EU security in general.   Properly understanding risk assessment enables us to identify key risks and their primary  drivers as well as to collect the most appropriate data to quantify those risks and their  consequences.   Considering the diversity of the EU Member States’ preferences and approaches to  measuring risks, identifying the methods used in each Member State is a vital first step  towards greater harmonisation, collaboration and effectiveness in managing resource  deployment and planning for the future. Different approaches should aim towards similar  outcomes and this is achievable by finding common recipes in using different tools to  achieve common results.   Collecting different types of risk assessment and analysis methods used by Member States  allows the identification of best practices and common challenges.  1.3.1 Strategic challenges in conducting risk assessments in general  A number of high-level challenges to risk analysis may be identified, which are present regardless of  the domain of risk. The ability to analyse different types of information from diverse stakeholders is  among the core challenges that risk analysts in any domain may confront. Choosing the right  method(s) of risk analysis is also one of the challenges. Depending on the type of risks assessed,  different methods may be employed, including the range of participatory methods that include  surveys, focus groups and expert panels (see Willis et al. 2004). Deciding on the appropriate risk  assessment and risk management strategy also requires careful analysis of the available data. Finally,  there is concern over terminology and the meaning of different terms.  National-level Risk Assessments  An Analysis Report  November 2013  Page  3  1.3.2 Important operational questions specific to CII risk assessments  From an operational perspective, practising risk analysis also raises several other important  questions pertinent to the specific application of risk analysis and which may be specific to the  particular domain of CII and cyber risk. Only those involved in implementing a National-level Risk  Assessment programme will be able to provide suitable answers to such questions. These questions  include:  (1) How can risk be estimated?  (2) What are tolerable levels of risk?  (3) Should (and if so how could) resources be allocated based on risk analysis?  For example, relating to the first question (with a specific focus on cyber security) Sandia Labs in  2012 released a report into Cyber Threat Metrics which attempts to list cyber threats and measure  them consistently and unambiguously (Mateski et al. 2012).  Relating to the second issue, Willis et al. (2012) discuss risk preferences in the Dutch national risk  assessment model. These preferences are used to determine what ‘weight’ citizens appear to place  on different levels of risk and therefore what they might consider tolerable or not.  Regarding the allocation of resources in the area of border security, it has been found that changing  the pattern of risk management measures (border patrols and so on) has a demonstrated effect  upon risks. Using pattern analysis has been proven in an experimental setting to improve metrics for  risk management such as higher interdiction rates for illegal border crossing10. Note that this is tool  or method independent. So this means that the method and/or tool is not the key.  1.4 Methodology  1.4.1 Overview of methodology  This report summarises results from a study conducted between April and October 2013. Figure 2  illustrates the steps taken during the study.  10  Predd, Joel B, Henry H Willis, Claude Messan Setodji, Chuck Stelzner (2012). ‘Using Pattern Analysis and Systematic Randomness to  Allocate U.S. Border Security Resources’.

As of 9 September 2013:  http://www.rand.org/pubs/technical_reports/TR1211  National-level Risk Assessments  An Analysis Report  November 2013  Page  4  Figure 2: Study design  The study consisted of:  (1) A review of policy documents, technical reports and recent scientific research papers11,  concerning risk analysis and assessment both in general and also specifically referring to cyber  security and CIIP.  (2) Conducting a series of unstructured interviews with academic and governmental experts  concerning the theory and practice of risk assessment. The aim of these interviews was to feed into  the generation of a set of indicators by the research team of the overall level of the sophistication of  national risk assessments.  (3) Testing these indicators with three national-level key informant interviews (KII).  (4) A first step was conducting interviews with 17 national key informants (see Annex A: List of  organisations involved in the study (p.35). The organisations were selected on the basis of a pre- analysis of existing indicators relating to cyber risk analysis and indicators relating to the more  generic consideration of risk. Such indicators included: standardisation of terminology, presence of a  national cyber security strategy and integration of cyber security RA in national risk assessments or  CII asset definition and monitoring.  These were guided by an interview protocol. The aim of these interviews was to cross-check and  challenge the understanding within the study team of the key issues in national risk assessment.  Each interview was conducted according to the ‘Chatham House rule’12 and interviewees were sent  notes of their interview afterwards in order to verify the understanding of the study team.  Interviews were mainly conducted via telephone. A copy of the interview protocol can be found Key  Informant Interview Protocol.  (5) In a second step, a questionnaire was prepared which aimed to consolidate and confirm findings  from the Key Informant Interviews and to gather further evidence. For those countries that had  already participated through key informant interviews, a questionnaire was sent to interviewees,  pre-populated with their responses for verification. Representatives from an additional four  countries completed the questionnaire. A copy of the questionnaire can be found in Annex C:  Questionnaire (p.38).  (6) A validation workshop in September 2013 at ENISA’s 2nd International Conference on Cyber  Crisis Cooperation and Exercises, which was held in Athens, Greece.13  Overall, we collected information from 21 organisations. In accordance with the Chatham House  Rule, participants have not been specifically identified but the countries that participated are listed  in Annex A: List of organisations involved in the study (p.35) while the protocol used is given in Annex  B: Key Informant Interview Protocol (p.36).  11  The full list of references is available in the Bibliography at the end of this report.  12  Chatham House rule: http://www.chathamhouse.org/about-us/chathamhouserule  13  2nd ENISA International Conference on Cyber Crisis Cooperation and Exercises,  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/ccce-conference  http://www.chathamhouse.org/about-us/chathamhouserule  National-level Risk Assessments  An Analysis Report  November 2013  Page  1  2 Context  This section summarises policy initiatives and guidance at national, European and international level  on cyber security and risk assessment. We provide an overview of the most recent and relevant  policy developments in this area up to and including the revised ENISA mandate of June 2013, the  February 2013 EU Cyber Security Strategy (EUCSS) and accompanying Commission proposal for an  NIS Directive (European Commission 2013a).  2.1 Policy impetus in Europe  In recent years, policy-makers in Europe have been strengthening cyber security commitments and  capabilities.14 This is reflected in the formulation of a number of cyber security strategies both at  European and Member State level.15 In February 2013 the European Union released its overarching  European Cyber Security Strategy with accompanying legislative proposals for a Network and  Information Security (NIS) Directive. The need to focus on a more coordinated approach has been  highlighted in several European Commission communications (e.g. European Commission 200916),  and the Commission has taken tangible steps towards creating a pan-European policy. The  comprehensive European Cyber Security Strategy covers the main relevant policy domains:  resilience and NIS in cyberspace, tackling cybercrime and an international strategy and defence  policy with respect to cyber security.  Within the 2013 European Cyber Security Strategy, the policy mandate for improving resilience and  NIS security sits with Directorate-General for Communications Networks, Content and Technology  (DG CNECT) and seeks to strengthen the resilience of critical infrastructure, enhance preparedness  and foster a cyber-security culture through the centralisation of information, private sector  partnerships, single market-based approaches and an international outlook (European Commission  2013b).  A key element of the 2013 proposals for an NIS Directive is the broader information collection  mechanism to gather information on threats and incidents.  Prioritisation of threats in the Strategy is based on lessons learned from large-scale incidents.  Regular meetings of the Commission are used to determine the level of threat severity using a scale  of 1–3. There is no single international categorisation on threat criticality, although ENISA published  a study into threat characterisation (see below) which synthesises a range of different assessments.  It goes without saying that if a large incident has happened does not mean that this is a more or less  serious threat. Rather, a large scale incident bears some relevance to impact. There are also a few  other elements in this than threat priorities (e.g. vulnerabilities, protection level, etc.).  ENISA has also been playing a role in supporting implementation of European cyber security policy  by providing guidance on National Contingency Plans (NCPs) and National Cyber Security Strategies  (detailed below).  14 For example, a recent study found that across European countries, cyber security threats are characterised as high, major, prominent or  priority when compared to other national-level risks (for example terrorism, pandemics, natural disasters, state-on-state conflict and  nuclear war). See Robinson et al., forthcoming 2013.  15 For example, Belgium, Italy and the Czech Republic have recently introduced cyber security strategies and the formulation of a European  Cyber Security Strategy was released in February 2013  16 European Commission’s Communication on Critical Information Infrastructure protection (CIIP), http://eur- lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=COM:2009:0149:FIN:EN:PDF  National-level Risk Assessments  An Analysis Report  November 2013  Page  2  The Digital Agenda for Europe (European Commission 2010, p. 245) and the European Cyber Security  Strategy emphasise the increasingly interconnected nature of threats and their impact in  cyberspace, and accordingly advocate coordinated responses. The Strategy emphasises that cyber  threats are not EU-specific and cannot be overcome by the EU alone; rather, they can emanate from  and affect any part of the world. The 14 actions proposed in the Digital Agenda for Europe specify a  number of threats, including terrorist or politically motivated attacks against information systems  which form part of the critical infrastructures of the EU and its Member States.  In early 2013, ENISA published a threat landscape (ENISA 2013b), which classifies these threats  according to both the vector (for example, drive-by downloads, worms, trojans, exploit kits, botnets)  and threat agents. This distinction is important because it separates the ways or routes and the  agent behind them. The list of threat agents is described thus:   Corporations   Cybercriminals   Employees   Hacktivists   Nation states   Terrorists  Outside of the specific areas of cyber security, in 2009 the European Commission also published a  communication on a community approach to the prevention of natural and man-made disasters  (European Commission 2009) which sets out a number of measures to be included in a community  strategy for prevention of natural and man-made disasters. These measures were set out under four  main headings:   Creating the conditions for the development of knowledge-based disaster prevention  policies at all levels of government   Linking actors and policies throughout the disaster management cycle   Making existing instruments perform better for disaster prevention   Reinforcing international cooperation in the field of prevention  In addition, a 2010 European Commission Staff Working Paper on Risk Assessment and Mapping  Guidelines for Disaster Management (European Commission 2010) illustrates how Risk Assessment  can be used as a framework to aid in the management of civil contingencies.  Nonetheless, it may be observed that policy impetus revolves around three main topics:  (1) The importance of understanding and identifying the risks (risk assessment);  (2) The importance of preparedness17 (NCPs, national exercises, pan-European exercises, pre-  defined process and infrastructures);  (3) The importance of ‘lesson learning’ and cooperation.  2.1.1 The role of National Contingency Plans  In this section we will look at the role of National Contingency Plans (NCPs) in managing, responding  to and recovering from major CII incidents.  Critical information infrastructures are vulnerable to a variety of disruptions by both man-made  (where there is a directed threat, i.e., motivated adversaries who behave strategically or via human  error) and systemic risks (accidents or consequences of other risks or systemic failures). High-profile  17  For a definition and discussion on this subject please look at the Risk Preparedness paper that has been published by the  ENISA Working Group on Risk Management. Available here: http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/risk-management  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/risk-management  National-level Risk Assessments  An Analysis Report  November 2013  Page  3  examples include the cyber-attacks targeting South Korea in early 2013; the accidental severing of  submarine telecommunications cables in 2008 off the coast of Egypt and outages suffered in Syria in  2012 and 2013 and a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack against the Domain Name Service  (DNS) of Network Solutions in January 2009. While such events may be reduced through effective  risk management, it is virtually impossible to eliminate all risks. Successful contingency planning,  execution, and testing are thus essential to mitigate the risk of system and service unavailability.  ENISA is taking important steps to further this aim: in 2011, the Agency studied NCPs in several  countries and released a good practice guide.18 NCPs are the national-level interim structures and  measures to respond and recover services following major incidents that involve CIIs and that lead to  a crisis. NCPs include actions at all levels, from the technical to the operational/tactical, to the  strategic/political.  NCPs, also referred to as National NIS Cooperation Plans in the proposed NIS Directive,19 are the  national-level structures and measures to recover services following major crisis-inducing incidents  that involve CIIs.  The European Commission recognises the importance of national contingency planning in the  mitigation and recovery process, and acknowledges that this is a vital means for reinforcing EU  defence mechanisms for CII. In its Action Plan20 for enhancing the security and resilience of  European CII, the Commission points out the need to develop ‘national contingency plans and  organise regular exercises for large scale networks security incident response and disaster recovery,  as a step towards closer pan-European coordination. National/Governmental CERTs/CSIRTs may be  tasked to lead national contingency planning exercises and testing, involving private and public  sector stakeholders. The involvement of ENISA is called upon to support the exchange of good  practices between Member States’ (European Commission 2009).  Furthermore, Article 5.2 of the proposal for a NIS Directive released in February 2013 (European  Commission 2013a) also articulates the way a risk assessment should fit into an overarching strategy  and plan, namely that:  The national NIS strategy shall include a national NIS cooperation plan complying at least  with the following requirements  (a) A risk assessment plan to identify risks and assess the impacts of potential incidents;  (b) The definition of the roles and responsibilities of the various actors involved in the  implementation of the plan;  (c) The definition of cooperation and communication processes ensuring prevention,  detection, response, repair and recovery, and modulated according to the alert level;  (d) A roadmap for NIS exercises and training to reinforce, validate, and test the plan.  Lessons learned to be documented and incorporated into updates to the plan.  Figure 3 illustrates the potential actors and potential structures involved in an NCP based on ENISA’s  good practice guide.  18  More information is available at: www.enisa.europa.eu/c3e/nis-cooperation-plans  19  See Article 5 of the proposed NIS directive at: http://ec.europa.eu/digital-agenda/en/news/eu-cybersecurity-plan- protect-open-internet-and-online-freedom-and-opportunity-cyber-security  20  http://ec.europa.eu/digital-agenda/en/news/policy-critical-information-infrastructure-protection-ciip  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/c3e/nis-cooperation-plans http://ec.europa.eu/digital-agenda/en/news/eu-cybersecurity-plan-protect-open-internet-and-online-freedom-and-opportunity-cyber-security http://ec.europa.eu/digital-agenda/en/news/eu-cybersecurity-plan-protect-open-internet-and-online-freedom-and-opportunity-cyber-security http://ec.europa.eu/digital-agenda/en/news/policy-critical-information-infrastructure-protection-ciip  National-level Risk Assessments  An Analysis Report  November 2013  Page  4  Figure 3: National NIS Cooperation Plan Structures 21  Interim structures may involve the formation of committees and response teams (at various levels),  the initiation of secure, robust means and platforms for communication, possibly the assembly of a  crisis cell, and the involvement of different actors from the private sector(s) that have predefined  roles during the crisis response. For managing national and cross-country large-scale cyber incidents  (leading to crisis situations) it is necessary to have a proper NCP which includes international cyber  crisis cooperation. NCPs include actions at all levels – ranging from the technical, to the  operational/tactical, to the strategic/political.  The lifecycle of NCPs is depicted in Figure 4. Based on ENISA’s previous work on NCPs, the NCP  usually has a lifespan of 2–3 years depending on the size of the country and the complexity. It is  clear, though, in all cases that in the development lifecycle of NIS contingency plans and their  subsequent revisions the first step is to perform a thorough national NIS risk assessment. Other  steps include the design and deployment of the plans, the testing, training and exercising, and finally  the reviewing and auditing.  21  Good Practice Guide for National Contingency Plans for CIIP, ENISA, 2011.  National-level Risk Assessments  An Analysis Report  November 2013  Page  5  Figure 4: The lifecycle of national NIS contingency plans (source: ENISA Good Practice Guide on NCPs)  2.1.2 National policy initiatives  Across a range of EU and non-EU countries, there are some disparities in how CII / Cyber security  threats and risks are characterised with a wide variety of descriptions, scope and approaches across  each country (Robinson, 2013).  However, as the Impact Assessment accompanying the 2013 proposal for an NIS Directive shows,  many EU countries already have efforts such as adopting a national CERT, cyber exercises or have a  National Cyber Security Strategy. Nonetheless, some countries remain at a somewhat early level of  maturity in this area (European Commission 2013c).  2.1.3 Examples of international initiatives on risk assessment for cyber security  In 2012 the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) held a workshop on  national-level crisis planning and interagency coordination in partnership with the Swiss Federal  Chancellery.22  The key objective of the workshop was to facilitate transnational knowledge-sharing and to  encourage cross-sector partnerships through identification of best practice. This objective has also  been promoted through the OECD High Level Risk Forum, a venue for senior policy-makers and  22  Opening remarks by OECD Deputy Secretary-General Yves Leterme at the Joint OECD – Swiss federal Chancellery  Workshop on Inter-Agency Crisis Management 28 June 2012, Geneva, Switzerland available at  http://www.oecd.org/governance/risk/Speech%20DSG%20Leterme%20-final.pdf  http://www.oecd.org/governance/risk/Speech%20DSG%20Leterme%20-final.pdf  National-level Risk Assessments  An Analysis Report  November 2013  Page  6  industry executives to advance the international policy agenda for building resilience to large-scale  risks.  The discussions focused on improving risk management through international strategic cooperation  and exchange of best practices. It also addressed the issue of governance, emphasising the  importance of equipping national authorities with the right tools and institutional frameworks for  coordinated action and swift responses. OECD debate has also highlighted the need to engage senior  political leaders regarding investment in risk management capabilities in order to achieve practical  impact.23 Another good example of this sort is the World Economic Forum that runs a risk  management exercise and delivers a risk report for the Davos meeting of political leaders. It is  interesting to see how this (non NIS) based assessment is being conducted and how different voices  are unified under a number of certain contexts.  2.2 The role of ENISA  Created in 2004, ENISA acts as a centre of excellence for Member States and EU institutions on  network and information security issues, and has established itself as a key stakeholder in the  European cyber security community. ENISA has been at the forefront of supporting the work of EU  Member States and other relevant stakeholders in their efforts to develop and maintain NCPs for  CIIs. The first step towards this target was the preparation of a Good Practice Guide24 intended to  shape the development process of coordinated response and crisis management of large-scale CII  incidents. The Guide has helped facilitate the development of NCPs and their lifecycle, and has  helped EU Member States to develop, test, improve and maintain well-functioning NCPs. Since then,  the Agency has held numerous workshops across Europe to assist in the planning of national  exercises to help explore and strengthen NCPs.  ENISA is working on guidance for national cyber security strategies (NCSS).25 The Agency successfully  oversaw the coordination of the first pan-European cyber security exercises26 in November 2010,  Cyber Europe 2010. ENISA facilitated the second pan-European cyber exercise, Cyber Europe 2012,  which took place on 4 October 2012. As stated in the 2009 Commission Communication on Critical  Information Infrastructure Protection (European Commission 2009), the 2010 Digital Agenda  (European Commission 2010, p. 245) and the evaluation report of Cyber Europe 2010 (ENISA 2010),  exercises are deemed an important element of a coherent strategy for cyber-incident contingency  planning and recovery, both at national and European levels. It is in this context that the further  investigation of threat modelling and risk assessment for CII risks takes place.  ENISA has done considerable work on Risk Management over the last years. The full information  about this work can be found in a structured way at the Risk Management webpages at ENISA’s  website.27  23  ibid  24  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/cyber-crisis-cooperation/national-contingency-plans  25  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/national-cyber-security-strategies-ncsss  26  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/c3e  27 http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/risk-management  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/cyber-crisis-cooperation/national-contingency-plans http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/national-cyber-security-strategies-ncsss http://www.enisa.europa.eu/c3e  National-level Risk Assessments  An Analysis Report  November 2013  Page  7  3 Summary of Findings  In this chapter we present a summary of our findings from the empirical research. These findings are  structured according to the following broad subject areas:   Published open guidance for RAs   National context for cyber security   Implementation of National-level Risk Assessment  3.1 Existing guidance on Risk Assessment  From our targeted reviews we found several high-level guidance documents concerning the process  of establishing a National-level Risk Assessment. These range from generic guidance which applies to  Risk Analysis at the national level, to specific guidance looking at Critical Information Infrastructures  (CII). Below we summarise five of the publicly available guidance and documents relating to the  practice of risk analysis which the research team consider useful, as they are comprehensive and  cover the issues from a methodological or programmatic perspective. Our review identified some  useful guidance on the practice of risk assessment in the context of national and international risks,  but much of the Critical Information Infrastructure risk analysis guidance identified concerns risk  analysis in the context of organisational ICT risks, rather than national-level risk assessment. For  example, although many internationally available standards such as ISO 27005: 200828, ISO 15408:  200929 and ISO 31010:200930 contain guidance on risk analysis they are often framed at the system  or organisational rather than the national level. Of the five guidance documents summarised below  two are aimed at national-level assessment and two at the organisational level.  The International Risk Governance Council (IRGC) published a report in 2006 setting out an  integrated framework for how national-level risk analysis initiatives might be set up (International  Risk Governance Council 2005). It provides guidance for the development of comprehensive  assessment and management strategies to cope with risks. The framework is focused on those risks  with international implications which have the potential to harm human health and safety, the  economy, the environment and/or the fabric of society at large, but it is not on Information (cyber)  Risk Management. The IRGC report is instructive for its breadth of analysis of terminology, its focus  on the process of undertaking a national-level risk assessment, and the importance it places on  understanding the context and environment in which a risk assessment is conducted.  The Institute for the Protection of the Security of the Citizen (IPSC), part of the Joint Research Centre  (JRC) in Ispra, Italy, published a Technical Note containing a compendium of 19 different Risk  Analysis methodologies applicable at the national level in the context of Critical Infrastructure  Protection (CIP) (Giannopoulous et al. 2012). This finds that although there are a significant number  of risk assessment methodologies each with a common and linear approach (identification and  classification of threats, identification of vulnerabilities and evaluation of impact), there is a huge  difference between methodologies in their scope, intended audience and domain of applicability.  This report also finds that risk assessment methodologies can be further categorised by whether  they are for a particular sector or whether they take a systems approach.  Some guidance was identified on conducting cyber-security and CII-related Risk Assessments at the  organisational level. Examples include those from the US National Institute of Standards and  28  ISO/IEC 27005:2008 Information technology -- Security techniques -- Information security risk management  29  ISO/IEC 15408-1: 2009 Information Technology – Security Techniques – Evaluation Criteria for IT Security – Part 1:  Introduction and General Model  30  ISO/IEC 31010:2009 - Risk Management - Risk Assessment Techniques  National-level Risk Assessments  An Analysis Report  November 2013  Page  8  Technology (NIST) and the UK HMG Technical Risk Assessment IA Standard No. 1. In addition, ENISA  has an extensive inventory of the most common Risk Analysis methods. The catalogue isavailable on  ENISA’s website.31  In September 2012 NIST released a Guide for conducting Risk Assessments (NIST 2012). It notes that  risk assessment is done throughout an organisation. It indicates that there are no formal  requirements for a risk analysis, and organisations (by which is meant the US government) should  have maximum flexibility in applying guidance. Importantly, the limitations of risk analysis are  described, including that they are often not precise instruments of measurement, and that the  outputs are of course dependent upon the quality of information provided, the limitations of specific  methodologies, tools and techniques used and the subjectivity, trustworthiness and quality of the  data, the interpretation of results, and the skills and capabilities of individuals or groups conducting  the assessment.  The UK’s Technical Risk Assessment IA Standard No. 1 (issue 3.51) from 2009 (CESG & Cabinet Office  2009) is a component of the UK government’s policy framework and is intended to be used across  the public sector. It provides a framework for identifying, assessing and determining the level of risk  to an ICT system. This guidance is useful in including an understanding of the risk analysis lifecycle  (how it fits into the process of applying measures to manage the risk), as well as containing a  practical worked example.  The US National Academies of Science (NAS) evaluated the different risk analysis methods used in  the US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) in a report published in 2010.32 This found that  although a generally appropriate conceptual framework had been developed, no capabilities and  methods appeared adequate for supporting DHS decision-making with the exception of risk analysis  for natural disasters. It made a number of recommendations including improvements to the way in  which models are used following scientific practices, and building a strong culture of risk analysis.  3.2 National context for cyber security  In this section we summarise results from the fieldwork concerning the national context for cyber  security. The national context is important as it informs the work and outputs of any national risk  assessment programme. For example, without national-level policy ownership of these issues, the  results of a National-level Risk Assessment might go unheeded.  In some of the countries studied, cyber National-level Risk Assessments sometimes sit alongside risk  assessments done in other sectors. Figure 5 illustrates the national-level structures when this is the  case.  31  ENISA Inventory of Risk Management/ Risk Assessment Methods (2011) http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/risk- management/current-risk/risk-management-inventory/rm-ra-methods  32  Committee to Review the Department of Homeland Security’s Approach to Risk Analysis (2012) National Research  Council of the National Academies Review of the Department of Homeland Security’s Approach to Risk Analysis  Washington DC 2010  National-level Risk Assessments  An Analysis Report  November 2013  Page  9  Figure 5: Risk inputs to senior decision-makers  3.2.1 Countries having a National Cyber Security Strategy  A National Cyber Security Strategy (NCSS) may be considered as a key background component of a  National-level Risk Assessment. An NCSS should outline the role that the National-level Risk  Assessment plays and how it might contribute to prevention of crises. ENISA maintains an online  directory on NCSS across the world and undertook a study into NCSS in 2012 (ENISA 2013c).  Six countries consulted in the study have a specific NCSS (United Kingdom, Finland, Germany,  Estonia, the Netherlands and Switzerland) in place. In Finland, this has been released most recently  (January 2013) and is currently in its implementation phase. In Estonia, the strategy is being revised  at the time of writing. In Spain, the national Cyber Security Strategy has been developed by  representatives from the Ministry of the Interior, defence industry and the CNPIC (the National  Centre for Critical Infrastructure Protection) but is pending approval. In some other countries there  is no specific National Cyber Security Strategy, though in Sweden efforts are underway to develop  one. For comparison, Japan’s latest revision to its national Cyber Security Strategy was due in June  2013, having first been published in 2006.  3.2.2 Organisations with a mandate to address cyber security and /or CIIP  Next, we consider the presence of a designated cyber security organisation or authority in the  countries consulted in the study. National-level organisations with a responsibility to consider cyber  security are key stakeholders of a National-level Risk Assessment – either by conducting the  National-level Risk Assessment themselves or by providing assurance on risk assessments conducted  by other stakeholders (see below). Depending on the nature of the national-level organisation they  National-level Risk Assessments  An Analysis Report  November 2013  Page  10  may also have responsibility for CIIP, or responsibility may lie within a separate agency or even a  telecommunications regulator.  Across the countries on which information was collected, policy-level ownership of cyber security  and CIIP was held in different types of organisation. Some had a designated cyber security agency  (such as the Office of Cyber Security and Information Assurance (OCSIA) in the UK) whilst in others  the interior ministry, telecommunications regulator or other entity was responsible at the national  level for cyber security. Also, there are cases where cyber security responsibilities are shared among  a number of public entities, with no single designated authority. Understanding how the policy  ownership of cyber security works is important because the nature of the national-level body or  bodies with ownership of cyber security will inform what particular risks are prioritised and how the  risks need to be communicated for maximum impact.  In the UK the OCSIA works closely with lead departments and CCS to ensure that cyber security risks  are effectively represented in the National Risk Register.  In Estonia, a specific Information Systems Authority (Riigi Infosüsteemi Amet – RIA) is responsible for  covering cyber and information security. RIA is a sub-division of the Ministry of Economic Affairs and  Communications and its focus is on protection of information systems necessary for the functioning  of vital services. In Denmark, the national IT security authority resides in the Centre for Cyber  Security. The Centre is responsible for providing a threat analysis.  In France, the ANSSI (Agence nationale de la sécurité des systèmes d’information) was created in  2009 to address IT systems security across a number of vital sectors and to help the private sector  achieve security. ANSSI reports to the SGDSN (Secrétariate général de la défense et de la sécurité  nationale), which then reports to the Prime Minister.  In Germany, the German Federal Office for Information Security (BSI) currently acts as the national  security agency to promote IT security in the country. Alongside the Ministry of Interior and the UP- KRITIS33 PPP it conducts detailed work on threat and risk analysis.  In the United States, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has the federal mandate to tackle  the civilian aspects of CIIP under the vision set by the Executive Branch (the White House).  3.2.3 Other actors in cyber security collaboration  Actors in cyber security collaboration within the countries consulted in the study also include  ministries and government departments. In most countries consulted Ministries of the Interior are  responsible for civil protection, overall coordination and regulation of crises and emergencies and  often play an important part in cyber security collaboration. They may undertake coordination of the  national cyber security strategy or they may host centres to protect critical infrastructure, such as  the National Centre for Critical Infrastructure Protection in Spain. Ministries of Justice may also be  involved: for example, the Dutch National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) is part of the Ministry of  Safety and Justice and of the National Coordinator for Counterterrorism and Security (NCTV). In  Germany, a role is also played by the Federal Ministry of Economics and Technology and in the UK by  the Department of Business, Innovation and Skills (BIS). In South Korea, the National Intelligence  Service and the Ministry of Science, ICT and Future Planning are officially responsible for cyber  security.  33  Bundesministerium des Innern (2007) CIP Implementation Plan of the National Plan for Information Infrastructure  Protection (‘UP-KRITIS’) As of 13 October 2013:  http://www.bmi.bund.de/SharedDocs/Downloads/EN/Broschueren/2009/kritis.html  http://www.bmi.bund.de/SharedDocs/Downloads/EN/Broschueren/2009/kritis.html  National-level Risk Assessments  An Analysis Report  November 2013  Page  11  3.2.4 Examples of coordination among different actors in the cyber security arena  As cyber security is a cross-domain issue, in order to derive an accurate appreciation of the risks,  input must be taken from a range of entities in the public and private sector.  Most countries are aware of the importance of coordination with public and private sector actors,  even if they might not necessarily have a centralised national coordination authority. In Spain, for  example, the National Centre for Critical Infrastructure Protection (CNPIC) located within the Spanish  Ministry of the Interior is tasked with conducting RAs to evaluate physical and cyber threats and  works closely with public and private sectors (e.g. critical infrastructure managers). CNPIC also  communicates with the National Antiterrorism Coordination Centre, which provides CNPIC with risk  analyses that are then integrated into its assessments.  In the UK, the Department of Business, Innovation and Skills (BIS) is responsible for a significant part  of the cyber security strategy, especially with regard to issues concerning the private sector. The  Office of Cyber Security & Information Assurance (OCSIA) works in close cooperation with  Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ) and receives and analyses intelligence from  public sector agencies, allowing them to identify and prioritise threats.  In some countries the coordination function is performed by a specific cyber security centre. In  Japan, coordination between actors in cyber security is provided by the National Information  Security Center (NISC) which acts as a facilitator of information security efforts of government  agencies and a point of contact for international affairs. NISC coordinates Critical Infrastructure  sector-specific ministries, related organisations and designated sectors including, for example,  information and communications, finance, aviation, railways, etc. The ISPC (Information Security  Policy Council) is a supreme body for endorsing important cyber security policies. Similarly, the  National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) in the Netherlands performs a coordinating function between  government departments and between private and public sectors in a relatively decentralised  system where government departments and different private sector actors are responsible for  different aspects of cyber security.  In the United States, the Department for Homeland Security’s Office of Cyber Security and  Communications plays a role in regard to non-military critical infrastructure within US federal  efforts. This is under the auspices of the 2009 National Infrastructure Protection Plan (NIPP) and the  Executive Order from the White House of February 2013 (White House 2013). These are fed into the  US National Security Committee as the highest-level organisation responsible for analysing all  national-level risks to the United States. Within DHS, the Homeland Infrastructure Threat and Risk  Analysis Centre (HITRAC) performs risk analyses for the 16 critical infrastructures. DHS units link, via  a range of other mechanisms such as the Partnership for Critical Infrastructure Security (PCIS), sector  coordinating councils and Information Sharing and Analysis centres, to pull together a Risk Profile for  each Sector under the Critical Infrastructure Partnership Advisory Council CIPAC).  Some countries have set up a specific high-level cyber security council – a political body, including  members from different ministries. In Germany, the council receives some input from the PPP set up  in the country to share insights from practitioners’ perspectives. In Estonia, the Cyber Security  Council is a sub-council of the general-level Security Council and is responsible for approving cyber  security strategy. The Critical Information Infrastructure Protection (CIIP) Council which includes  representatives from both public and private sector reports to the Cyber Security Council. Both  councils meet regularly.  Coordinating efforts across different sectors have also been in place in Finland, where the national  cyber security strategy was coordinated by the Security Committee chaired by a senior civil servant  and including representatives from government ministries.  National-level Risk Assessments  An Analysis Report  November 2013  Page  12  3.2.5 The decentralised National-level Risk Assessment approach  Some countries have adopted decentralised approaches. In summary this approach is a different  way to undertake National-level Risk Assessment since it relies upon each actor completing their  part of the Risk Assessment in a decentralised fashion. Figure 6 outlines the differences between the  decentralised and centralised National-level Risk Assessment approach.  Figure 6: Decentralised and single methodology approach  The outcomes of these assessments then feed into the National-level Risk Assessment. A key aspect  is maximising consistency across the different assessments, as they may have been produced using  diverse methodologies.  Decentralised approaches are taken in Finland, Switzerland and Sweden, although information  sharing and close relationships between public and private sector shareholders are recognised as  important for risk analysis. In Finland, the practice of RA is devolved according to individual  organisations. There is no single set of ‘RA tools’ which are applied at the organisational level, nor a  ‘normative’ framework for risk analysis. In Switzerland, cyber risk is seen as an integral part of a  wider overall risk picture. Notable cooperation took place during the preparation of the National  strategy for Switzerland’s protection against cyber risks. On an operational level, MELANI (the  Reporting and Analysis Centre for Information Assurance), a coordination and reporting centre for  incidents, plays a key role.  In Sweden, the lead agency for RA is the Swedish Civil Contingencies Agency (MSB) which provides  nonbinding guidance and tools for others in a range of sectors to follow. PTS (the Swedish Post and  Telecom Authority), which regulates the post and telecommunications sector, performs RAs annually  in the area of CIIP using tools from the MSB. For counties and municipalities, a similarly  decentralised approach is taken with delegated authorities for crisis management activities and RA.  National-level Risk Assessments  An Analysis Report  November 2013  Page  13  There is a certain element of decentralisation also evident in the US approach, as each of the 16  critical infrastructures has its own sectoral body responsible for production of a risk assessment,  which may be driven by different requirements – e.g. if a sector is highly regulated then the  subsequent RA will be take on a similar character, perhaps being focused on issues of specific  interest to the regulator. Each RA is reported to be analysed and quantified in terms meaningful to  that particular sector.  3.2.6 Conclusions regarding the national context for cyber security  Among the 20 countries consulted as part of this study there are considerable differences  concerning which public administration has the policy responsibility (or is the ‘customer’) for risk  assessments undertaken in the domain of CII. Therefore, this is likely to have an impact upon how  the risk analysis is performed (what particular priorities are accorded to different aspects within it)  and the approach used to communicate the results of any National-level Risk Assessment to senior  decision-makers.  3.3 Overview of findings relating to National-level Risk Assessment  programmes  In this section we present the main findings from the research as they relate specifically to National- level Risk Assessment in this domain. We identify commonalities and variations in the approaches  for threat assessment, how countries have implemented their National-level Risk Assessment, key  challenges and lessons learned. Table 1 summarises all these, while Figure 7 illustrates the possible  inputs to the National-level Risk Assessment.

Which of these organisations might be involved is  sometimes quite dependent upon the national context. Other aproaches on this process have been  described by ENISA in its previous work on risk management34.  34  Risk Management process, http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/risk-management/current-risk/risk-management- inventory/rm-process  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/risk-management/current-risk/risk-management-inventory/rm-process http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/risk-management/current-risk/risk-management-inventory/rm-process  National-level Risk Assessments  An Analysis Report  November 2013  Page  15  Figure 8: Organisations analysed as having some kind of role in conducting National-level Risk Assessments  3.4 Approaches to threat modelling  In this section we will look at the different aspects of the threat modelling and characterisation,  including the terminology and approaches used.  3.4.1 Terminology in threat modelling  Definitions of specific terms differ across countries and sometimes also within countries. The  majority of countries under review have adopted their own definitions of key terms such as ‘threat’,  ‘vital services’; ‘strategic sectors’, ‘national security interests’; ‘risk’ and ‘critical risk’. However,  categorisation of threats may differ both between EU countries and between different sectors  within a country. Some countries have specific threat catalogues in place, though this does not  automatically mean they have a standard definition of what a threat is. Security objectives are in  some cases outlined in very generic terms. There is no single international categorisation on threat  criticality. In addition, for some countries threat assessment can be very sensitive.  3.4.2 Threats addressed in national security strategies  Cyber threats can be addressed in specific cyber security strategies or in more general national  security strategies. In the UK, the National Security Strategy (NSS) addresses threats and trends  relating to domestic and international security. This is informed by the National-level Risk  Assessment, which deals with accidental and deliberate types of risk (including cyber). Within the  strategy, ‘national security interests’ are defined broadly as ‘secure spaces within the UK’,  encompassing protection of UK well-being, infrastructure, way of life, etc. Cyber is identified as  ‘priority one’ risk, with other priority one risks including terrorism and state threats.  In Finland, a number of threat characterisations are included in the 2010 Strategy for Society  Security. These can be used to inform new regulations. The 2010 strategy does not identify any  specific ‘adversaries’, but the 2013 Cyber Security Strategy identifies a range of threats including  ‘hacktivism’; ‘cyber-criminality’; ‘cyber-terrorism’ and ‘cyber-espionage’.  The Swiss Cyber Strategy sets out definitions of terminology (e.g. ‘risk’ and ‘critical risk’). MELANI35  applies ‘thresholds’ when classifying risks by their probability but it tries to avoid thresholds where  possible due to the complexity of the risks. With regard to cyber risks, there is an emphasis on  qualitative assessments as quantitative assessments often relate to vulnerability, yet it is argued that  actual threat is more important than vulnerability in the cyber domain.  3.4.3 Scenario-based approaches  Several countries use scenario-based approaches to assess threats.  In Estonia, the importance of threats is determined based on two dimensions: (1) threats to a  defined list of vital services and (2) the Emergencies Act which describes an emergency situation.  One such emergency is defined as ‘a large scale cyber-attack’ and there is a response plan for this  scenario. With the help of public and private sector discussion, scenarios were formulated together  with response plans to different cyber attack scenarios.  35  MELANI – Reporting and Analysis Centre for Information Assurance http://www.melani.admin.ch/?lang=en  National-level Risk Assessments  An Analysis Report  November 2013  Page  16  In Germany, the Ministry of the Interior takes responsibility for threat assessments. For general  threats to critical infrastructure, a Public–Private Partnership (PPP) was set up under the UP-KRITIS  programme concerned with the operation of critical infrastructures such as transport, food, energy,  ICT, health, etc. To share problems/ threats from the practitioners’ perspective, this PPP inputs  information to the Ministry of the Interior. The PPP uses a scenario-based approach in which the  group considers potential responses to a threat scenario analysed on different levels. One of the  challenges is the complexity of finding an objective route to weigh/determine formal measures of  probability. Initiatives focus on the most important processes/services that should not be  interrupted, such as the financial sector or ICT.  3.4.4 Quantitative approaches  Unlike many EU countries, risk assessment in Japan is quantitative in nature. Risk Analysis is  conducted by a CIP Committee under the Information Security Policy Council (ISPC). The threat  model is structured around four kinds of threats. These are defined in the Second Action Plan for  Information Security of Critical Infrastructure and include: (1) Intentional factors (e.g. cyber attack);  (2) Non-intentional factors; (3) Disaster (i.e. external factors); (4) Impact from other sectors (e.g.  blackouts). The relevance of these four categories is evaluated annually. The model does not cover  detailed ‘sub-categorisation’ within these threat types. The model is used on two levels: (1) a service  level and (2) a verification level.  3.4.5 Qualitative approaches  Countries with a specific threat modelling technique in place tend to use qualitative models.  Qualitative assessments (although quantitative assessments of vulnerability are often made) are the  usual approach used by countries when deciding upon the significance of a threat. Qualitative  models with a broad range of threats are common in the Nordic countries and the Netherlands.  Some countries use the geographical scope of the consequences (e.g. local, regional, national  approach) to determine how critical a threat is.  In the Netherlands, different methodologies are used to characterise threats in different sectors and  departments. The NCSC threat model used during an annual cyber security risk assessment includes  state and non-state actors (terrorists, hacktivists, script kiddies, etc.). Threats are ranked using a  high-medium-low scoring system based on a qualitative assessment.  France places threats into three categories: espionage, destructive attacks and attacks on integrity.  In Denmark, the Danish Emergency Management Agency acts as a coordinating committee and  considers a broad spectrum of threats at the national level. The Agency focuses on consequences  and preparedness. The Danish model divides threats into: ‘nation state actors’ and ‘non-nation state  actors’. Faced with the latter (e.g. cyber-criminals), the Centre for Cyber Security manages  emergency recovery while the police are responsible for prosecutions.  Sweden uses an ‘all-hazards’ approach. The model looks at a wide range of threats which include  unauthorised use of information, eavesdropping and technical malfunctions of systems, intended or  unintended. Validation of threats takes place at the level of the Swedish Civil Contingency Board. It  might be so that a validation also, on a sub-level, could takes place within an sector. Risks are linked  to the five national values of protection established by the Swedish government. This analysis also  considers vulnerabilities and consequences.  3.4.6 Threat modelling under development  Some countries have not yet fully deployed a threat modelling methodology. For example, the  Spanish CNPIC has so far defined twelve strategic sectors and is currently developing a plan to  National-level Risk Assessments  An Analysis Report  November 2013  Page  17  address sector-specific threats. This plan will use a top-down methodology. CNPIC is collaborating  with ministries with sector-specific expertise (e.g. the Ministry of Industry) in order to identify  sector-specific threats. Once the plan is finalised, CNPIC will work with infrastructure operators.  3.4.7 Conclusions for threat modelling  Most of the countries that participated in this research used a qualitative understanding of the  threats, although there was an intricate quantitative model identified. Many countries split the  threat actor/agent from the attack means/vector.  It should be stressed that more work is needed in the area of cyber threat modelling; current  approaches are developed in an ad-hoc manner and insular. Currently, there is no clear standard or  practices in place. This may be a direct result of the very fast-changing threat landscape, as  highlighted by ENISA’s reports (see ENISA 2013b).  3.5 Approaches to Risk Assessment  In this section we summarise what risk analysis methodologies have been deployed by the  participants in the research. In some cases we gained detailed information on specific  methodologies deployed.  3.5.1 RA strategy  National-level Risk Assessments  An Analysis Report  November 2013  Page  18  Some of the countries analysed have a formalised National-level Risk Assessment framework in  place. As an example, in the UK the National-level Risk Assessment informs responses to security  threats. The National-level Risk Assessment is approved by both ministers and chief scientists. The  success of the National-level Risk Assessment in the UK model depends on the ‘buy-in’ of a range of  government departments. The National-level Risk Assessment does not focus on private sector  issues such as companies’ vulnerability. Management of specific risks, in turn, is owned by the  department or agency with relevant expertise in that area. When a department ‘owns’ a risk, it is  responsible for reviewing and updating it in the National-level Risk Assessment on an annual basis,  as well as for risk mitigation. Where risk ownership is unclear, the Cabinet Office is the default  owner. The NCSS addresses impact on business, national security threats, awareness, cybercrime,  etc. Figure 9 outlines how these mechanisms work between different organisations.  In Estonia, the Ministry of the Interior prepares a single restricted document based on RA carried out  by critical services every year. This RA is sent off to relevant ministries and agencies which synthesise  the results. Different ministries and public sector agencies play a crucial role in reviewing the  statements of different vital service providers to ensure correct reporting. Specific glossaries are  used to ensure consistent usage of terminology.  3.5.2 Decentralised RA  The Nordic countries and Switzerland have a more decentralised RA devolved to individual  organisations. There is no single set of ‘RA tools’ to apply at the organisational level, or a ‘normative’  framework for RA. Cyber risk may be seen as a part of a wider overall risk picture.  In Sweden, the lead agency in RA is the Swedish Civil Contingencies Agency (MSB) which provides  mandates for other sectoral organisations. Sweden has a decentralised approach whereby sectors  are responsible for drawing up an RA. In Denmark, RA is the responsibility of each  telecommunications company as a national-level RA is deemed unviable. It is worth noting that a  similar situation exists in Japan, where telecommunications operators and industries use different  RA models with a range of terms and definitions. There is no unified RA model as separate sectors  face distinct types of risk. RA takes place every 1–2 years as part of a Plan, Do, Check, Act (PDCA)  cycle.  Figure 9: Interactions between public and private sector in the NRA process  National-level Risk Assessments  An Analysis Report  November 2013  Page  19  3.5.3 Conclusions for approaches to Risk Assessment  There are a variety of approaches taken to RA on a spectrum of centralised to decentralised models.  This may be driven by prevailing contextual factors in a particular country; for instance, the extent to  which other stakeholders can be required to follow a particular standard for National-level Risk  Assessments or whether this could be successfully accomplished using ‘softer’ policy mechanisms.  Further research is required to assess which of the approaches best fit specific national-level risk  mitigation strategies. National-level cyber risk assessment is still an emergent activity which will  require a number of iterations in order to truly define best practices. Initiatives such as this study, by  providing an overview of existing approaches, could well lead to better risk assessments in the  future.  3.6 National-level RA methodologies in use  RA methodology differs from country to country, with some countries consulted in the study not  using a formalised methodology. Figure 10 illustrates the main differences between the various  methodologies reported in use.  Figure 10: Examples of quantitative, hybrid and qualitative approaches  3.6.1 Scenario-based approach  A scenario-based approach is an RA methodology used by some countries in our research. In the UK,  RA is undertaken as part of a three-stage process based on a scenario-focused approach: (1)  departments and agencies provide information on scenarios; (2) a cross-government discussion  follows to determine whether these are the appropriate scenarios to be considered (this  consultation involves chief scientists and policy/ economics/ intelligence experts) and (3) scenarios  are finally assessed according to impact and plausibility.  Measuring impact and plausibility: case of the UK Impact is measured in terms of casualties,  fatalities, economic harm (reduced GDP), social disruption and psychological impact. Measuring  impact involves the risk owner and other government departments with relevant expertise and/or  likely to be most affected by the scenario. Plausibility is determined by intelligence from other  National-level Risk Assessments  An Analysis Report  November 2013  Page  20  government authorities. This criterion uses a logarithmic scale to determine the order of magnitude  ranging from 1 in 2 to a 1 in 20,000 likelihood.  The private sector facing element of the RA is carried out by the Centre for Protection of National  Infrastructure (CPNI), which operates on a more asset-based model, identifying critical assets  Adapting this to the cyber context might be challenging as it requires a more systems-based, rather  than asset-based approach (due to the complex interdependencies in cyberspace). Lastly, the Civil  Contingencies Secretariat (CCS) concentrates on supporting government efforts around RA,  preparation and planning, response and recovery, and resilience.  In the telecommunications sector, Denmark also uses a scenario-based approach. The RA for this  sector includes probabilistic events (accidents, natural catastrophes, etc.) in a handful of online  scenarios. Within each scenario, guidance is provided on how to act in each situation but there is no  explanation for the primary reasons why an attack may occur.  In the US, in the civilian domain, the HITRAC program and the Risk and Modelling and Simulation  Unit in the DHS provide a risk estimate which is expressed in qualitative risk pairs (a list of each risk  with its consequence and likelihood). These risk pairs cover an all-hazards approach (including  accidents and natural disasters) and cover both physical and cyber-related risks.  Qualitative and quantitative tools in Sweden. In Sweden, a combination of qualitative and  quantitative tools are used to assess risks related to particular scenarios with regard to  consequences and the likelihood of a similar event occurring in Sweden. Scenarios are developed  according to criteria that include over 20 context-forming variables such as location, time and area  of impact. Impact of the threat is then categorised (if possible) according to the geographic scope of  the consequences (local, regional, national) and the duration of the disruption. These details are  then used to estimate the overall impact on the sector. Additionally, societal consequences are  assessed according to a 5-grade scale. These are expressed in qualitative terms. The Swedish  national risk assessment also covers antagonistic threats. Disruptions to electronic communications  have been identified as one of 27 particularly serious (national) events that are gradually being  subjected to more in-depth analysis.  3.6.2 Combination of different approaches  Some countries combine different approaches in their RA methodology, often inspired by  methodologies used in different countries and based on standards adopted internationally. In  Estonia, the RA methodology is based on guidelines from the Ministry of the Interior which are in  turn based on different methodologies and various international standards adapted to the Estonian  case; for example BS 25999 (now ISO 22301),36 ISKE37 and the German BSI standards.38 Five levels of  probability measures are defined and used in the RA guide.  In Switzerland, the Swiss Office of Civil Protection has designed a toolkit to go alongside the National  Strategy for Switzerland’s protection against cyber risks. It takes known ISO methodologies and  combines them with those in the German handbook for critical infrastructure. The toolkit does not  36  ISO, ‘ISO 22301: 2012’, Standards catalogue.

The MELANI  approach uses sector-specific standards for RA, depending on the scenario.  The new RA framework in France is based on a well-established organisational level RA approach  known as EBIOS (ANSSI 2010) focused on physical security that looks at the sector, seeks to identify  threats and design how best address them. Cyber is integrated in all the different models/ sectors (a  specified number of sectors and sub-sectors including energy, transport and defence). Each sector  evaluates risks at three levels: macro, mid and micro. A qualitative approach is taken to determine  the most important risks. Precise probabilities are not used. The same methodology is used for every  type of RA at both the micro and macro levels. The importance of updating risk assessments to  ensure they stay relevant is recognised in this context.  3.6.3 Other approaches and work in progress  In some cases, there is a perception that a national RA methodology is less of a priority than dealing  with pan-European problems (e.g. pan-European computer incidents). Despite the lack of a national  risk framework for cyber, significant technical work carried out by CERTs may still prove useful, as in  the case of Portugal.  In another country we studied, the RA is based on the predicted impact on different processes in the  critical sectors. During discussions on RA within the multi-stakeholder discussion group, however,  neither ‘risk’, nor ‘impact’ were said to be clearly defined in this country. RA practitioners used  interviews, brainstorming and discussion to determine threats. They focused on listening to industry  advisors’ recommendations as the best way to gain an accurate sense of the risk landscape. In this  particular country, operators are expected to assess their own risks.  In many countries the development of an RA methodology may be considered a work in progress.  The Spanish CNPIC is working on a three-point impact assessment to evaluate:  (1) impact on personnel (casualties);  (2) impact on national economy;  (3) environmental impact;  (4) impact on the society wellbeing.  The Centre has identified five thresholds which are classified and measured quantitatively. CNPIC  personnel are currently taught to use ‘Magerit’, a risk assessment methodology used predominantly  in the public sector, publicly available in Spanish.39 This methodology is primarily used to assess  probability.  3.6.4 Conclusions for methodologies used  There are a variety of methodologies deployed for RA, including those using qualitative and  quantitative methods. Some countries have adopted a hybrid approach whilst other countries are at  an emergent stage with respect to the choice of a particular methodology.  3.7 Key challenges from national experiences  Interviewees and questionnaire respondents were asked to identify what they perceived to be the  key challenges facing their country in relation to national-level RA for cyber security. The following  were the most commonly mentioned: (1) lack of harmonised legal framework; (2) incomplete and  39  Ministerio de Administraciones Publicas (Spanish Ministry for Public Administrations) (2005) Magerit v.2 As of 13  October 2013: http://www.csi.map.es/csi/pg5m20.htm  http://www.csi.map.es/csi/pg5m20.htm  National-level Risk Assessments  An Analysis Report  November 2013  Page  22  diverse risk assessment methodologies; (3) getting a comprehensive understanding of threats; (4)  effective risk management and preparedness; (5) insufficient information sharing. Below we  describe the nature of the problem as characterised by those participating in the research.  3.7.1 Lack of harmonised legal framework for cyber security  This barrier to a more effective cyber security system takes various forms. Most commonly,  countries have adopted different definitions, or only vague definitions of key terms such as ‘critical  information infrastructure’, ‘risk’, ‘threat’, or ‘priority risks’, etc., which can hinder an effective  harmonisation of risk assessment. Risk assessment is often decentralised and different RA tools are  provided by different (sometimes private) providers. With no harmonised legal framework, it is  difficult to talk about minimum standards. Moreover, opinions differ among countries as to the  usefulness of a minimum standards requirement or minimum level of maturity to implement  National-level Risk Assessment.  3.7.2 Incomplete and diverse risk assessment methodologies  The diversity of methods used in RA process by different countries was reported by participants to  pose a serious challenge to a coherent pan-European cyber security approach. In some countries,  different sectors have their own priorities and there is no unified method to prioritise risk; others  use an ‘all-hazards’ approach. Some participants argue that an all-hazards approach might not be the  most effective as it covers a wide range of different types of risks which are very diverse and could,  potentially, be better dealt with in clusters. However, ‘clustering’ presents its own challenges as it  raises questions about how to group/model actors’ intentionality of threat. Additionally, participants  mentioned methodological challenges in measuring the value of assets, economic costs, providing  gross assessments of likelihood of threat for scenario-based RA and prioritising systems that need  protection. RA methodology should be continually reviewed and updated to include new  information on new threats. Reconciling different risk assessment practices and standards across  companies may also be difficult.  France and EBIOS. It was reported that France is currently reviewing its EBIOS methodology (which  is consistent with the ISO27005:2008 Information Technology – Security Techniques – Information  Security Risk Management) Specification for an Information Security Management System) to make  it more suitable for use at a national level. This is an example of how methodologies might be  revisited as countries get more sophisticated in their National-level Risk Assessment programmes.  3.7.3 Lack of comprehensive methods to assess threats  A key challenge reported by respondents is assessing threats and how they affect public/private  sectors and society. A better understanding of threats leads to a better understanding of risk.  Identifying cyber risks has been highly challenging due to both the large scope of threats and risks  and the immediacy of current threats, which lead cyber security actors to favour a more reactive  approach. But such a reactive approach may have partly prevented development of a more  comprehensive threat model. To enhance countries’ understanding of threats, it was suggested that  a common taxonomy of threats in the electronic communications sector shared by all countries in  the EU could be developed. As part of the RA, some mechanism to determine likelihood could be  developed for threat actors, particularly those with hostile intent.  3.7.4 Need for effective risk management and preparedness capacity and skills  Participants reported that consultation on cyber security and CII risks often involves working through  a scientific advisory committee to address best sources of evidence and to build in an independent  scientific review base. In terms of risk preparedness, this differs between organisations, and often  National-level Risk Assessments  An Analysis Report  November 2013  Page  23  depends on the amount of RA training they have received – particularly among vital service  providers. For a sustainable level of preparedness, staff should be trained and competent to carry  out the RA. Skilled and competent staff may, however, be difficult to find for every operator.  3.7.5 Information sharing  Various forms of information sharing have been proposed and tried in different countries, though  many carry with them significant challenges.40 Furthermore, opportunities to learn lessons from  other countries are reportedly often hampered by budget limitations and difficulties in obtaining  cyber information from operators. A key challenge identified by participants is how to coordinate  the different perspectives of sectors and organisations and ensure better information sharing. One  country reported the use of careful vetting and cooperative agreements to permit information to be  pushed from government to the private sector.  3.7.6 Conclusions on key challenges from national experiences  The lack of a harmonised framework for cyber security could be considered as a key challenge  (especially with regard to terminology) in addition to the diversity and relative uncertainties of  current methodologies. Other key challenges were of a more systematic nature that affect many  aspects of cyber security, including information sharing.  3.8 Lessons identified by respondents  3.8.1 Assimilating best practices and learning from international cooperation  One of the main lessons which respondents from several countries reported that they had learnt  was recognising how useful international cooperation can be and how countries can learn from one  another. Respondents from several countries recommended looking at good examples in Nordic  countries which have experience in dealing with natural disasters, have published risk confidence  indicators and have developed exercises that bridge intentions and actions. Some countries have  also experienced fruitful cooperation with the US and Canada. Visiting centres in countries with  relatively advanced CI capabilities such as the UK, Germany, US, Canada, France, Japan and the  Netherlands has provided some countries with valuable best practice experience as they set up their  own National-level Risk Assessment capabilities.  Several respondents expressed a preference for learning best practices from each other rather than  imposing a single methodology at the EU level. The UK, for example, has recognised the importance  of engaging with international stakeholders within the EU and OECD networks. The UK reported that  this involved sharing best practice in identifying and assessing risk, for example through organising a  summer 2013 conference among nations with relatively mature RA programmes to share  experience; liaising with insurance companies and drawing on their advanced RA methods and using  OECD research for examples of effective and ineffective approaches across a range of countries.  It was reported that the national RA in Sweden was inspired by a review of national risk assessments  undertaken by the UK, Norway, the Netherlands and Canada. There is also an ongoing exchange of  experiences from national risk assessments with other countries, the effectiveness of which was  reported to be improving.  40  Creation of PPPs in cyber security, for example, can be problematic as detailed information sharing in this context may  be difficult due to the sensitivity and difficulty of obtaining information.  National-level Risk Assessments  An Analysis Report  November 2013  Page  24  The respondent from one large EU Member State reported using best practice from other countries  in a number of ways and considered this to be a very good way to support cyber security. More  specifically, the use of ENISA good practice guides (e.g. the NSIE guide) and some guides from other  Member States were highlighted by this respondent.  In terms of knowledge exchange once a programme is underway, the French ANSSI works with other  international programmes and shares methodologies with them through systematic international  collaborative platforms.  3.8.2 Relationships with the public and private sector  An effective cyber security system requires effective relationships among private and public sector  actors. These can be nurtured through, for example, meetings with vital service providers as  problems arise and particularly through good information sharing. A collaborative approach is  deemed crucial to drive progress. For example, for the French ANSSI, it was reported that one of the  main lessons learned was that a PPP is needed in addition to formal policy-making in order to build a  strong relationship with the private sector. In the US, a key aspect noted to demonstrate to the  private sector the business case of good cyber security practices concerned replacement of legacy  equipment used in critical infrastructures. Conducting a National-level Risk Assessment was  articulated as beneficial because of the fact that technologies likely to replace legacy equipment  would be more reliant upon networks such as the public Internet.  3.8.3 Context-specific emergency responses and CI protection approaches  A frequently learnt lesson among the studied countries was reported to be that effective emergency  responses and CI protection approaches have to be context-specific and that attempting to replicate  other countries’ approaches completely is not useful. Countries have important differences in  legislation, culture and societal structure which have to be considered for any new initiative such as  a National-level Risk Assessment programme to work well.  3.8.4 Conclusions on lessons learnt  Many countries are seeking to draw lessons from others in establishing or deploying a National-level  Risk Assessment programme. The role of international platforms such as ENISA and the OECD would  appear to be helpful in this regard, especially if the work done complements each other. As with  many other cyber security issues, establishing good cooperation with the private sector and making  sure that responses take account of contexts were also seen as important lessons identified, if not  learnt.  3.9 Suggestions from Member States for National-level Risk Assessment  development  In this final section we report findings about how countries participating in this research are  considering onward development of National-level Risk Assessment efforts. An analysis of interview  and questionnaire responses indicates that countries have recognised the following to be the key  areas to address in the development of a National-level Risk Assessment: (1) greater understanding  of threats and their effects on society; (2) better management of incidents; (3) greater stakeholder  involvement and information sharing; (4) improved national CIIP frameworks and (5) guidelines on  the EU level.  National-level Risk Assessments  An Analysis Report  November 2013  Page  25  3.9.1 Greater understanding of threats and their effects on society  Most countries would like to focus on developing a better understanding of threats and how they  affect public and private sectors and society more broadly. In practice at the national level, this  would involve, for example, developing a good threat assessment mechanism that pulls together  both threats and risks, creation of a cyber security centre to collect and share information on  information security breaches, making risk analysis available to every system with a critical mission  and focusing on understanding the rationale behind attacks.  3.9.2 Better management of incidents  Together with improving their understanding of threats, countries also recognise the need to  improve the management of incidents. It was suggested that within the next 12–18 months there  ought to be a robust understanding of risk and mitigation priorities. A specific suggestion from one  respondent involved handling ‘rare events’ by developing a 20-year horizon scanning exercise that  would resemble national risk assessment but could give a sense of alternative future scenarios.  3.9.3 Greater stakeholder involvement and information sharing  In the short to medium term, some EU countries expressed a desire to see involvement of more  stakeholders such as SMEs in the process of RA and improving the cross-sectoral dialogue through  PPPs. Most emphasised they would like to focus on bringing entities together particularly to share  information on effective mitigation strategies. Another participant mentioned that the conduct of  sector-specific table-top or regional exercises should be seen as a priority in order to help broaden  the number of stakeholders.  3.9.4 Improved national CIIP frameworks  Several countries have specific steps in mind to improve their national CIIP frameworks. For  example, one seeks to establish a framework that ensures that problems faced by operators (such as  governance and systems management) are addressed effectively and operators are able to connect  with their management to raise visibility of risks. This framework should also improve impact  mapping. Others aim to develop a new RA model which would be more qualitative and would better  consider sector interdependencies or seek to implement a strategy that will provide more resources  to existing structures and ensure that government bodies understand and implement their  mandates in the cyber area. There are other examples that want to combine legislation in an  information society code, and others would like to focus more on including cross-border dimensions  in their RA. One country in particular noted the difficulty of translating RA guidance and capacity  building tools (e.g. self-assessments & training) from the organisational level to sector and then to  national level.  3.9.5 EU guidelines and support  Several countries would like to see ENISA establishing a list of the most important cyber risk  scenarios. They would also like to see the establishment of an international protocol for sharing  information on best practices for National-level Risk Assessments, as suggested by one large EU  Member State with reference to the role of the OECD.  3.9.6 Conclusions on reported national-level priorities for National-level Risk Assessment  programmes  As we have seen, there was a great deal of diversity with regard to the suggestions and avenues for  improvement, including: a greater understanding of threats and their effects upon society; better  management of incidents; greater stakeholder involvement and improved national CIIP frameworks.  National-level Risk Assessments  An Analysis Report  November 2013  Page  26  Suggestions for the EU level were also proposed, such as the creation of scenario catalogues and  provision of guidelines.  National-level Risk Assessments  An Analysis Report  November 2013  Page  27  4 Conclusions and recommendations  4.1 Conclusions  Concerning national cyber security contexts, we see that there is a great deal of diversity which can  make it challenging to provide guidance that would work in all situations. However, this diversity  might be seen as a strength, since there might be more adverse consequences for cyber security at  the EU level if each country had the same National-level Risk Assessment approach; flaws in the  approach would be magnified resulting in extensive policy vulnerability. Understanding national  context is likely to have a positive effect upon how the risk analysis is performed (what particular  priorities are accorded to different aspects within it) and the best approach to communicate results  to senior decision-makers.  Most of the countries that participated in this research used a qualitative or categorical  understanding of the severity of risks (low, medium, high) although there were some that had  developed quantitative models (e.g. a risk is severe if it affects 1 in 20,000 people). Many countries  split the threat actor/agent from the attack means/vector.  We see that there are a diverse variety of types of implementation adopted on a spectrum of  centralised to decentralised approaches. This seems to be driven by prevailing contextual factors in a  particular country; for instance, the extent to which other stakeholders can be required to follow a  particular standard for National-level Risk Assessments or whether this could be successfully  accomplished using ‘softer’ policy mechanisms.  We can see that there are a variety of RA methodologies deployed, including those using qualitative  or narrative and quantitative (numerical or mathematical) methods. Some countries have adopted a  hybrid approach. Other countries are at an emergent stage with respect to the choice of a particular  methodology.  Some key challenges identified include the perception of a lack of a harmonised framework for cyber  security (especially with regard to terminology) and the diversity and relative uncertainties of  current technical methodologies to perform National-level Risk Assessments. This latter point seems  in part to support the evidence generated by this study which aims to provide guidance on the  establishment of a National-level Risk Assessment methodology and programme. Other key  challenges included those relating to issues of a more systematic nature that affect cyber security,  including information sharing.  Many countries are seeking to draw lessons from others regarding establishing or deploying a  National-level Risk Assessment programme. The role of international platforms such as ENISA and  the OECD would appear to be helpful in this regard. As with many other cyber security issues,  establishing good cooperation with the private sector and making sure that responses take account  of contexts were also seen as important lessons identified, if not learnt.  Regarding priorities suggested by participants, there was some diversity with regard to the  suggestions and avenues for improvement including: a greater understanding of threats and effects  upon society; better management of incidents; greater stakeholder involvement and improved  national CIIP frameworks. Suggestions for EU-level action were also proposed, such as the creation  of scenario catalogues.  4.2 Recommendations  In this section we present our recommendations building upon relevant documents reviewed and  the evidence summarised in this report from interviewees and questionnaire.  National-level Risk Assessments  An Analysis Report  November 2013  Page  28  Recommendation 1: Member States should focus on achieving a better understanding of threats  and consequences for society  Member States are recommended to improve their understanding of threats and their impacts upon  society by, for example, improving threat analysis mechanisms, creation of appropriate  organisational structures to fuse intelligence and disseminating the results of risk analysis to owner- operators of systems with a critical mission.  Recommendation 2: Member States should integrate National-level Risk Assessment into the  lifecycle of their NIS cooperation plans and structures  It is recommended that Member States focus upon better integration of national-level risk analysis  and management into the cyber incident mitigation priorities, especially in the context of national- level NIS cooperation plans, procedures and structures. The suggestion of further development of  horizon scanning could be taken forward at the national level. Specific actions include considering of  cross-sector dependencies in National-level Risk Assessment models and frameworks establishing  National-level Risk Assessment training and self-assessment measures at sector and national levels.  Recommendation 3: Member States should expand stakeholder involvement and information  sharing  The question of how to encourage information exchange between different actors relevant to the  execution of National-level Risk Assessments is an important one but there is no easy answer.  Member States are recommended to consider the use of different mechanisms (for example,  sectoral exercises) to discover fruitful avenues to encourage information exchange. This  recommendation could be achieved over the short to medium term.  Recommendation 4: ENISA should develop, test and continuously mature a step-by-step guide for  running National-level Risk Assessment Programmes  The evidence gathered in this study, including the outcomes of the panel session during the 2nd  International Conference on Cyber Crisis Cooperation and Exercises,41 indicate there is a clear need  for a practical guide to aid Member States with their National-level Risk Assessment programmes.  Our recommendation is thus that a step-by-step guide on how to perform a National-level Risk  Assessment should be developed by ENISA, tested and maintained. Such a step-by-step guide should  be piloted with an EU Member State which is at the start of embarking upon efforts to more formally  assess cyber security risks. Such a pilot would set out to trial the use of the guide. Evaluation  questions should be specified at the start of the pilot including:   Who used the guide (in terms of what level of civil servant or administrator)?   What did users like about it? What did users dislike about it?   Where was it most effective? And where was it least effective?   How long did the National-level Risk Assessment programme take to set up when using the  guide?   How many people did it take to run the National-level Risk Assessment programme using the  Guide?   What would you have done differently?   Are there any issues not covered by the guide which would have been useful to have been  included?  41  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/ccce-conference  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/ccce-conference  National-level Risk Assessments  An Analysis Report  November 2013  Page  29  Recommendation 5: ENISA should establish a catalogue of scenarios to help Member States with  their National-level Risk Assessments  A set of potential cyber threat scenarios could be used by Member States as an off-the-shelf effort  to help either kick-start National-level Risk Assessments (for those at the start of the process of  setting one up) or for those Member States looking to gather more scenarios or validate existing  scenarios. This catalogue could act as a catalyst to help decision-makers get to grips quickly with  understanding risks in a controlled ‘safe’ environment. Work towards this direction that is already  being done by ENISA in the areas of the cyber threat landscape,42 cyber exercises43 and incident  reporting44 could be used to develop and maintain such a catalogue.  Recommendation 6: A community of practitioners with interest in cyber National-level Risk  Assessment should be established by the European Commission  Given the appetite expressed among participants for learning from other countries, another  recommendation is to use the momentum gained during the execution of this study to nurture an  informal network of National-level Risk Assessment practitioners. This network could share practices  and experiences relating to designing, running and operating National-level Risk Assessments in the  area of cyber security and CIIP. The establishment of an information-sharing protocol could support  this community of interest. The European Commission instruments, such as the NIS Platform45,  would be the most appropriate to implement his recommendation.  Recommendation 7: Exchanging practices in other cross-border risk domains should be reinforced  within for example the European Commission’s NIS Platform and other activities organised by  ENISA  Finally, there are other European institutions that perform similar functions to cyber National-level  Risk Assessment in other domains where risks have a cross-border implication. Examples include the  European Agency for Operational Cooperation at the External Borders of the EU (Frontex), some of  the EU’s financially orientated agencies (e.g. the European Central Bank), European Centre for  Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) in the domain of public health and many others. The  exchange of perspectives with experts from these other domains and institutions will yield valuable  insights into how to support and better facilitate national-level Risk Analysis in a cross-border  context across Member States. ENISA’s and the European Commission’s NIS Platform (see previous  recommendation) would be in position to implement this recommendation.  42  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/risk-management/evolving-threat-environment  43  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/c3e  44  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/Incidents-reporting  45  http://ec.europa.eu/digital-agenda/en/news/nis-platform-kick-meeting-working-groups  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/risk-management/evolving-threat-environment http://www.enisa.europa.eu/c3e http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/Incidents-reporting http://ec.europa.eu/digital-agenda/en/news/nis-platform-kick-meeting-working-groups  National-level Risk Assessments  An Analysis Report  November 2013  Page  30  Bibliography and further reading  ENISA papers  ENISA (2013a).

Research Outline  At this stage of the project ENISA aims to:  (i) examine empirical evidence on national-level risk assessment and threat modeling for  Critical Information Infrastructures (CII) across European Union Member States  (ii) outline risk assessment methodology principles in use by EU Member States that may  prove exemplary to others or highlight challenges  Research Deliverable and Approach  The aim of this project is to develop a National Risk Assessment Methodology which could be used  by EU Member States. The European Network and Information Security Agency, supported by RAND  Europe, is seeking to conduct semi-structured interviews with experts within EU Member States  involved in the cyber-security and CII risk assessment fields in order to understand key drivers of  these countries’ methodologies, policies and approaches that may be valuable to others.  This initial  phase consists of policymaker interviews supported by documentary analysis. Given your role in the  network and information security field in your country and the breadth of your experience, we  would be grateful for your input at this initial phase.  We propose a short interview with you in  person/by telephone addressing the following areas:   National co-ordination across cyber-security   Threat modelling characterisation   Approach to risk assessment   Key challenges and next steps  This annex contains further detail on the broad questions that are relevant to these areas.  We are  available to organise a meeting in person or by telephone and look forward to hearing from you.  Key topics  National co-ordination across cyber-security   Which is/are the organisation(s) which has/have the lead in your country in (i) developing  the national cyber-security strategy and (ii) outlining cyber-security threats and risks?   What national-level institutions have responsibility for contributing to threat modelling and  risk assessment in CII?   What are their competences (e.g. inter-agency unit; ministry of Interior; law enforcement;  national intelligence agency)?   How do the lead authority(s) co-ordinate other units with responsibilities in cyber-security  domestically?  How does the lead authority co-ordinate other units with co-ordinating cyber-  security bodies internationally? What learning has been undertaken with regard to risk  assessment and threat modelling methodologies?  National-level Risk Assessments  An Analysis Report  November 2013  Page  37  Threat modelling characterisation   How are threat actors modelled within current methodologies? What typologies are used?  (cf. nation-state; ideological; organised crime)   What decision processes drive the inclusion of these threat actors? Upon what rationale  were they included?   What process / mechanisms / models are used to characterise threat (expert analysis;  computational model; other) and why?   How is the severity of impact of these threat actors’ actions measured?  Upon what basis is  an understanding and ranking of severity developed?   What is the influence of other Member State frameworks on characterisation of threat?  Approach to risk assessment   How are lessons identified and learnt from the conduct of threat assessments across other  national-level concerns (cf. crime, terrorism)? What definitions of key terms are used (for  example risk) and why were these chosen?   What approaches to risk are taken (cf. quantitative/qualitative/mixed)   What tools and methodologies are used to assess risk?  What is the rationale for  use/rejection of specific tools?   What is the influence of other states’ tools on the risk assessment approach used?   Is your national methodology public? If so, could you please share it with us?   Are the results of the assessment made public (partially or in full)?   If the assessment result is not public, how are the risk owners involved?  Key challenges and next steps   What are the key challenges faced in threat modelling and risk assessment?   How do the model and assessment approach used account for and relate to wider National  Security priorities?   What is the frequency, process and depth of review of risk assessment and threat models  following implementation?   How do the risk assessment models affect levels of funding and balance of resource  prioritisation?   What is the maturity of the model used and how do you see it developing? What examples  of best practice can you offer to others?   What would be your recommendations for the EU level in terms of minimum standards in  threat modelling and what recommendations for other EUMS?   What will the model look like in 5 years’ time?  National-level Risk Assessments  An Analysis Report  November 2013  Page  38  Annex C:  Questionnaire  Questionnaire: Introduction  National-level risk assessment and threat modelling of (critical) ICT infrastructures and services are  essential prerequisite processes in the context of developing and maintaining a national Network  and Information Security (NIS) cooperation/contingency plan, which in turn is one of the main pillars  of a National Cyber Security Strategy.46  As part of the Work Programme 2013, ENISA is undertaking research into national-level risk  assessment and threat modelling methodologies used for (critical) ICT infrastructures. The objective  in this study is to identify the valuable approaches, practices and challenges that countries have  experienced in the methods used for assessing risks of (critical) ICTs infrastructures, the  dependencies and challenges. The results of the analysis would help to identify the strengths of the  methods used so that all countries in Europe learn from the experiences and practices of others,  hoping to close the maturity gap. ENISA is supported to gather evidence for this study by RAND  Europe.  Completing this questionnaire  The questions are either yes or no answers or there is space for your comments.

ENISA  aims to provide an evidence-based methodology for establishing a National-level Risk Assessment in  order to contribute to the wider objective of improving national contingency planning practices  (NCPs)1. This report will help towards rationalising national risk assessments in EU Member States in  order to reduce or eliminate vulnerabilities of critical Information and Communication Technology  (ICT) services and infrastructures. This objective was articulated in the February 2013 European  Cyber Security Strategy and thus sits within broader EU-wide efforts to improve crisis cooperation  activities.  This report should be of use to policy-makers who are charged with implementing a CIIP or cyber  security risk assessment programme. In addition, other interested parties may include regulators,  researchers and senior industry representatives from Critical Information Infrastructure sectors.  In this study we have analysed current National-level Risk Assessment practices in around twenty  countries and tried capture the main aspects of the implementation of their National-level Risk  Assessments. Which of these aspects are most effective in a particular country depends to a certain  extent on important administrative, economic, legal and cultural factors such as the dependence of  society on cyberspace; the way in which government activities are conducted and the pre-existing  state of the art in information security risk management. It is also important that National-level Risk  Assessment programmes should be linked to a national cyber security strategy. A high-level cyber  security strategy, clearly owned, can provide the context and ultimate rationale for a National-level  Risk Assessment programme.  There are a number of permutations or variations in National-level Risk Assessment which may be  implemented depending on the specific context of the country. Such possible options have been  listed in this report, with clear guidelines for National-level Risk Assessment programme manager on  how to identify these local specificities and requirements.  Regarding the identification of threats and modelling we have found that the most important are:   articulated in a high-level strategy,   based on scenarios,   described qualitatively or quantitatively.  Concerning approaches to the conduct of a National-level Risk Assessment, they can be performed:   through a formalised central framework or approach (a one-size-fits-all), or   based on a decentralised model where each actor prepares their own risk assessment to be  integrated by a coordinating authority.  Finally, national-level risk management methodologies may be based upon:   Scenario-based approaches where actors are gathered together to consider scenarios in the  round; such scenarios describe risks as a narrative and label them by applying simple  categories of likelihood and impact (low, medium, high),   Quantitative approaches which apply ordinal thresholds (e.g. a risk is classed severe if it  affects 1 in 20,000), or   Approaches which combine elements of all of the above (for example, using scenarios and  then qualitative and quantitative methods).  1  For more on this topic see ENISA’s Guide for National Contingency Plans: http://www.enisa.europa.eu/c3e/national-  contingency-plans  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/c3e/national-contingency-plans http://www.enisa.europa.eu/c3e/national-contingency-plans  National-level Risk Assessments  An Analysis Report  November 2013  Page  iv  Key challenges  We have identified a number of key challenges for National-level Risk Assessment programmes,  including:   The lack of a harmonised national framework for cyber security, particularly with regard to  terminology;   Incomplete and diverse risk assessment methodologies (especially in the pan-European  context);   The lack of comprehensive methods to address threats;   The need for effective risk management and preparedness capacity and skills;   The need for more information sharing between different actors involved in a National-level  Risk Assessment  Common lessons  The lessons learned are grouped into the following areas:   The need to leverage international best practice, as many countries had visited others to  learn about risk analysis practices;   The importance of establishing effective collaboration between the public and private  sectors, especially where in some cases the private sector owns considerable parts of the  infrastructure;   Finally, the need for effective critical information infrastructure approaches to be tailored to  each national context.  Current priorities of National-level Risk Assessment programmes  Countries reported that they were focusing upon a number of priorities in the near to medium term,  including the following:   Improving understanding of threats and their effects upon society;   Better incident management;   Greater stakeholder involvement and information sharing;   Improved national CIIP frameworks;   Seeking further EU guidance and support.  In conclusion we can see that understanding of the national approach to cyber security and how risk  decisions are taken in different countries is important to ensure that the results of any National-level  Risk Assessment reach key decision-makers at the right time. It is also clear that there are a variety  of approaches and levels of sophistication used in National-level Risk Assessments. Qualitative tools  appeared to be preferred due to the complexities of understanding risk in the cyber domain.  Depending on the preconditions regarding implementation, risk assessment could be performed  using a common set of methods or in a more decentralised fashion. Challenges included the  diversity of methodologies and approaches to National-level Risk Assessments (which highlights the  need for this guidance document) as well as the complexities of public–private cooperation. As  might be expected, many countries studied drew lessons from others when preparing their National- level Risk Assessment programmes. Some countries had identified priorities that they were seeking  to focus on, including greater understanding of threats, improved stakeholder engagement and  better national CIIP frameworks.  Recommendations  Based on an analysis of the data gathered we recommend the following:  1. Member States should understand better the underlying cyber threats and risks that they  face and the impact to society.  2. Member States are advised to integrate National-level Risk Assessment into the lifecycle of  NIS incident management and cooperation plans and procedures.  National-level Risk Assessments  An Analysis Report  November 2013  Page  v  3. Member States should expand public–private sector dialogue and information sharing.  4. A practical step-by-step guide on how to perform National-level Risk Assessments should be  developed, tested and maintained. Such a guide should be piloted by countries at the early  stages of preparing their own National-level Risk Assessment programme. ENISA or another  international institution would be appropriate bodies to oversee this action.  5. A catalogue of scenarios to help Member States in their National-level Risk Assessments  should be established at EU level. Such a catalogue could be based on work already being  done at ENISA on the threat landscape2 and incident reporting3.  6. The EU community of practitioners with an interest in cyber National-level Risk Assessments  should be established and strengthened as information exchange platform, e.g., within the  framework of the European Commission’s NIS Platform4.  7. Risk analysis expertise must be shared from other domains that assess complex cross-border  risks, such as border security, financial services, aviation or public health for example within  the European Commission’s NIS Platform and other activities organised by ENISA.  2  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/risk-management/evolving-threat-environment  3  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/Incidents-reporting  4  http://ec.europa.eu/digital-agenda/en/news/nis-platform-kick-meeting-working-groups  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/risk-management/evolving-threat-environment http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/Incidents-reporting http://ec.europa.eu/digital-agenda/en/news/nis-platform-kick-meeting-working-groups  National-level Risk Assessments  An Analysis Report  November 2013  Page  vi  Table of Contents  Executive summary iii  1 Introduction 1  1.1 Purpose of this report 1  1.1.1 Target audience 1  1.1.2 About this document 1  1.2 Understanding risk assessment – terminology 2  1.3 About risk assessment 2  1.3.1 Strategic challenges in conducting risk assessments in general 2  1.3.2 Important operational questions specific to CII risk assessments 3  1.4 Methodology 3  1.4.1 Overview of methodology 3  2 Context 1  2.1 Policy impetus in Europe 1  2.1.1 The role of National Contingency Plans 2  2.1.2 National policy initiatives 5  2.1.3 Examples of international initiatives on risk assessment for cyber security 5  2.2 The role of ENISA 6  3 Summary of Findings 7  3.1 Existing guidance on Risk Assessment 7  3.2 National context for cyber security 8  3.2.1 Countries having a National Cyber Security Strategy 9  3.2.2 Organisations with a mandate to address cyber security and /or CIIP 9  3.2.3 Other actors in cyber security collaboration 10  3.2.4 Examples of coordination among different actors in the cyber security arena 11  3.2.5 The decentralised National-level Risk Assessment approach 12  3.2.6 Conclusions regarding the national context for cyber security 13  3.3 Overview of findings relating to National-level Risk Assessment programmes 13  3.4 Approaches to threat modelling 15  3.4.1 Terminology in threat modelling 15  3.4.2 Threats addressed in national security strategies 15  3.4.3 Scenario-based approaches 15  3.4.4 Quantitative approaches 16  3.4.5 Qualitative approaches 16  3.4.6 Threat modelling under development 16  3.4.7 Conclusions for threat modelling 17  National-level Risk Assessments  An Analysis Report  November 2013  Page  vii  3.5 Approaches to Risk Assessment 17  3.5.1 RA strategy 17  3.5.2 Decentralised RA 18  3.5.3 Conclusions for approaches to Risk Assessment 19  3.6 National-level RA methodologies in use 19  3.6.1 Scenario-based approach 19  3.6.2 Combination of different approaches 20  3.6.3 Other approaches and work in progress 21  3.6.4 Conclusions for methodologies used 21  3.7 Key challenges from national experiences 21  3.7.1 Lack of harmonised legal framework for cyber security 22  3.7.2 Incomplete and diverse risk assessment methodologies 22  3.7.3 Lack of comprehensive methods to assess threats 22  3.7.4 Need for effective risk management and preparedness capacity and skills 22  3.7.5 Information sharing 23  3.7.6 Conclusions on key challenges from national experiences 23  3.8 Lessons identified by respondents 23  3.8.1 Assimilating best practices and learning from international cooperation 23  3.8.2 Relationships with the public and private sector 24  3.8.3 Context-specific emergency responses and CI protection approaches 24  3.8.4 Conclusions on lessons learnt 24  3.9 Suggestions from Member States for National-level Risk Assessment development 24  3.9.1 Greater understanding of threats and their effects on society 25  3.9.2 Better management of incidents 25  3.9.3 Greater stakeholder involvement and information sharing 25  3.9.4 Improved national CIIP frameworks 25  3.9.5 EU guidelines and support 25  3.9.6 Conclusions on reported national-level priorities for National-level Risk Assessment programmes 25  4 Conclusions and recommendations 27  4.1 Conclusions 27  4.2 Recommendations 27  Bibliography and further reading 30  List of Acronyms 33  Annex A: List of organisations involved in the study 35  Annex B: Key Informant Interview Protocol 36  Annex C: Questionnaire 38  National-level Risk Assessments  An Analysis Report  November 2013  Page  1  1 Introduction  The capacity to manage crises is a fundamental element of good governance, as it tests  governments' capacity to provide the right responses at the right time to protect their  citizens and businesses and mitigate the impact of disasters.5  Effective risk assessment methodologies are the cornerstone of a successful Critical  Infrastructure Protection programme.6  This chapter introduces the topic of risk assessment and provides a rationale for why this guidance is  required.  We lay out some broad challenges associated with the areas of threat modelling and risk assessment  as they relate to a wider range of efforts to strengthen Member States’ activities on cyber7 crisis  management and cooperation, cyber contingency planning, cyber exercises and – more specifically –  the role that National-level Risk Assessments play in mitigating and reducing Critical Information  Infrastructure (CII) vulnerabilities. Although threats and impact are important, in the context of risks,  but also there are some other ones like: asset identification, assets valuation, risk prioritization,  scope of the assessment, assumptions made, experience from incidents, protection level from  current controls, gap analysis, risk appetite, etc. These are the main grounds for diversification in risk  assessments.  Risk assessment and management in particular is important to prevent, as well as manage, crises  since it lays the groundwork for effective crisis response. Undertaking risk analysis prior to a major  incident that might lead to a crisis makes it more likely that the response will be effective and  efficient.  1.1 Purpose of this report  This document is an Analysis Report containing the core evidence base from a study to understand  the practice of National-level Risk Assessments in different countries. The document is accompanied  by a Step-by-Step Guide on how to perform National-level Risk Assessment that contains more  practical guidance intended for implementation. These two documents are thus complementary: the  analysis report contains essential background information necessary to understand the context prior  to engaging on practical implementation using the Step-by-Step Guide. Target audience  This report is of use to policy-makers at national and international levels who are charged with  implementing a CIIP or cyber security risk assessment programme. Other interested parties may  include regulators, researchers and senior industry representatives from Critical Information  Infrastructure sectors.  1.1.2 About this document  Chapter 1 introduces the topic and provides a rationale for why this guidance is required.  5 Opening remarks by OECD Deputy Secretary-General Yves Leterme at the Joint OECD–Swiss federal Chancellery Workshop on Inter-Agency  Crisis Management 28 June 2012, Geneva, Switzerland available at  http://www.oecd.org/governance/risk/Speech%20DSG%20Leterme%20-final.pdf  6 Giannopoulos G, Filippini, R and Schimmer, M (2012) Risk assessment methodologies for Critical Infrastructure Protection.

National-level Risk Assessments  An Analysis Report  November 2013  Page  2  Chapter 2 provides an overview of the context including the policy landscape and guidance  developed by ENISA in the context of National-level Risk Assessments.  Chapter 3 presents a detailed summary of the findings.  Chapter 4 provides some conclusion and recommendations.  This is followed by an extensive bibliography and list of acronyms used in the report.  Appendices contain a list of participating countries, the questionnaire and Key Informant Interview  (KII) protocol used in the study.  1.2 Understanding risk assessment – terminology  ‘Risk’ is usually defined as the potential that a given threat will exploit vulnerabilities of an asset or  group of assets and thereby cause harm to the organization8. Haimes (2004) defines ‘risk’ as a  ‘measure of the probability and severity of adverse effects’ and notes that it is difficult to  comprehend because:  it is a complex composition and amalgamation of two components – one real (potential  damage or unfavourable adverse effects and consequences), the other an imagined  mathematical human construct termed probability.  Figure 1: Risk definitions 9  The following definitional questions , raised by Willis, should be answered prior to embarking upon a  risk assessment:   Security – how broadly is security defined? Does it relate to national security or a wider  interpretation perhaps including safety (e.g. energy security)?   Threat – does the threat model define directed threats (e.g. including a classification of  different adversaries or agents such as organised criminal groups, nation-states etc.) or non- directed threats (e.g. accidents, hardware or software failures)? Does it include systemic  concerns such as natural disasters? How dynamic is the threat model?  8 ISO/IEC 13335-1:2004 Information technology -- Security techniques -- Management of information and communications technology  security -- Part 1: Concepts and models for information and communications technology security management  9  Based on Willis 2007.  National-level Risk Assessments  An Analysis Report  November 2013  Page  2   Vulnerability – what characteristics of the domain, asset or infrastructure are vulnerable or  provide opportunities for the realisation of risk?   Impact – is impact defined in primary or secondary approaches? For example, would it cover  the long-term secondary consequences of the realisation of a risk or the consequences of  aversion measures?   Asset definition – what are the approaches used to identify the critical assets, required for  an organisation’s operations and their continuity, including Information resources that  support the organization's mission?   Likelihood – what are the approaches used to measure the probability that a specific event  will occur?  Will this model incorporate uncertainty?  A distinction is often made between risk analysis (or risk assessment) and risk management (i.e. the  implementation of measures to address the risk identified, which might be to avoid, reduce, share or  retain the risks) (Dorfman 2007).  Definitions used in a particular risk assessment will need to take into account that, from an  operational perspective, it may be possible to significantly reduce a risk (rendering the chances of it  occurring infinitesimally small), but that statistically it may not be possible to eliminate it entirely.  1.3 About risk assessment  During our research on risk assessment, both in the context of studies into risk generally and those  focusing on national security, we have identified four main issues that are applicable to CII risks:   Risk assessment is designed to increase awareness of the different kinds of risks that may  have an impact on CII specifically and national and EU security in general.   Properly understanding risk assessment enables us to identify key risks and their primary  drivers as well as to collect the most appropriate data to quantify those risks and their  consequences.   Considering the diversity of the EU Member States’ preferences and approaches to  measuring risks, identifying the methods used in each Member State is a vital first step  towards greater harmonisation, collaboration and effectiveness in managing resource  deployment and planning for the future. Different approaches should aim towards similar  outcomes and this is achievable by finding common recipes in using different tools to  achieve common results.   Collecting different types of risk assessment and analysis methods used by Member States  allows the identification of best practices and common challenges.  1.3.1 Strategic challenges in conducting risk assessments in general  A number of high-level challenges to risk analysis may be identified, which are present regardless of  the domain of risk. The ability to analyse different types of information from diverse stakeholders is  among the core challenges that risk analysts in any domain may confront. Choosing the right  method(s) of risk analysis is also one of the challenges. Depending on the type of risks assessed,  different methods may be employed, including the range of participatory methods that include  surveys, focus groups and expert panels (see Willis et al. 2004). Deciding on the appropriate risk  assessment and risk management strategy also requires careful analysis of the available data. Finally,  there is concern over terminology and the meaning of different terms.  National-level Risk Assessments  An Analysis Report  November 2013  Page  3  1.3.2 Important operational questions specific to CII risk assessments  From an operational perspective, practising risk analysis also raises several other important  questions pertinent to the specific application of risk analysis and which may be specific to the  particular domain of CII and cyber risk. Only those involved in implementing a National-level Risk  Assessment programme will be able to provide suitable answers to such questions. These questions  include:  (1) How can risk be estimated?  (2) What are tolerable levels of risk?  (3) Should (and if so how could) resources be allocated based on risk analysis?  For example, relating to the first question (with a specific focus on cyber security) Sandia Labs in  2012 released a report into Cyber Threat Metrics which attempts to list cyber threats and measure  them consistently and unambiguously (Mateski et al. 2012).  Relating to the second issue, Willis et al. (2012) discuss risk preferences in the Dutch national risk  assessment model. These preferences are used to determine what ‘weight’ citizens appear to place  on different levels of risk and therefore what they might consider tolerable or not.  Regarding the allocation of resources in the area of border security, it has been found that changing  the pattern of risk management measures (border patrols and so on) has a demonstrated effect  upon risks. Using pattern analysis has been proven in an experimental setting to improve metrics for  risk management such as higher interdiction rates for illegal border crossing10. Note that this is tool  or method independent. So this means that the method and/or tool is not the key.  1.4 Methodology  1.4.1 Overview of methodology  This report summarises results from a study conducted between April and October 2013. Figure 2  illustrates the steps taken during the study.  10  Predd, Joel B, Henry H Willis, Claude Messan Setodji, Chuck Stelzner (2012). ‘Using Pattern Analysis and Systematic Randomness to  Allocate U.S. Border Security Resources’. Santa Monica, CA: RAND Corporation, 2012. As of 9 September 2013:  http://www.rand.org/pubs/technical_reports/TR1211  National-level Risk Assessments  An Analysis Report  November 2013  Page  4  Figure 2: Study design  The study consisted of:  (1) A review of policy documents, technical reports and recent scientific research papers11,  concerning risk analysis and assessment both in general and also specifically referring to cyber  security and CIIP.  (2) Conducting a series of unstructured interviews with academic and governmental experts  concerning the theory and practice of risk assessment. The aim of these interviews was to feed into  the generation of a set of indicators by the research team of the overall level of the sophistication of  national risk assessments.  (3) Testing these indicators with three national-level key informant interviews (KII).  (4) A first step was conducting interviews with 17 national key informants (see Annex A: List of  organisations involved in the study (p.35). The organisations were selected on the basis of a pre- analysis of existing indicators relating to cyber risk analysis and indicators relating to the more  generic consideration of risk. Such indicators included: standardisation of terminology, presence of a  national cyber security strategy and integration of cyber security RA in national risk assessments or  CII asset definition and monitoring.  These were guided by an interview protocol. The aim of these interviews was to cross-check and  challenge the understanding within the study team of the key issues in national risk assessment.  Each interview was conducted according to the ‘Chatham House rule’12 and interviewees were sent  notes of their interview afterwards in order to verify the understanding of the study team.  Interviews were mainly conducted via telephone. A copy of the interview protocol can be found Key  Informant Interview Protocol.  (5) In a second step, a questionnaire was prepared which aimed to consolidate and confirm findings  from the Key Informant Interviews and to gather further evidence. For those countries that had  already participated through key informant interviews, a questionnaire was sent to interviewees,  pre-populated with their responses for verification. Representatives from an additional four  countries completed the questionnaire. A copy of the questionnaire can be found in Annex C:  Questionnaire (p.38).  (6) A validation workshop in September 2013 at ENISA’s 2nd International Conference on Cyber  Crisis Cooperation and Exercises, which was held in Athens, Greece.13  Overall, we collected information from 21 organisations. In accordance with the Chatham House  Rule, participants have not been specifically identified but the countries that participated are listed  in Annex A: List of organisations involved in the study (p.35) while the protocol used is given in Annex  B: Key Informant Interview Protocol (p.36).  11  The full list of references is available in the Bibliography at the end of this report.  12  Chatham House rule: http://www.chathamhouse.org/about-us/chathamhouserule  13  2nd ENISA International Conference on Cyber Crisis Cooperation and Exercises,  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/ccce-conference  http://www.chathamhouse.org/about-us/chathamhouserule  National-level Risk Assessments  An Analysis Report  November 2013  Page  1  2 Context  This section summarises policy initiatives and guidance at national, European and international level  on cyber security and risk assessment. We provide an overview of the most recent and relevant  policy developments in this area up to and including the revised ENISA mandate of June 2013, the  February 2013 EU Cyber Security Strategy (EUCSS) and accompanying Commission proposal for an  NIS Directive (European Commission 2013a).  2.1 Policy impetus in Europe  In recent years, policy-makers in Europe have been strengthening cyber security commitments and  capabilities.14 This is reflected in the formulation of a number of cyber security strategies both at  European and Member State level.15 In February 2013 the European Union released its overarching  European Cyber Security Strategy with accompanying legislative proposals for a Network and  Information Security (NIS) Directive. The need to focus on a more coordinated approach has been  highlighted in several European Commission communications (e.g. European Commission 200916),  and the Commission has taken tangible steps towards creating a pan-European policy. The  comprehensive European Cyber Security Strategy covers the main relevant policy domains:  resilience and NIS in cyberspace, tackling cybercrime and an international strategy and defence  policy with respect to cyber security.  Within the 2013 European Cyber Security Strategy, the policy mandate for improving resilience and  NIS security sits with Directorate-General for Communications Networks, Content and Technology  (DG CNECT) and seeks to strengthen the resilience of critical infrastructure, enhance preparedness  and foster a cyber-security culture through the centralisation of information, private sector  partnerships, single market-based approaches and an international outlook (European Commission  2013b).  A key element of the 2013 proposals for an NIS Directive is the broader information collection  mechanism to gather information on threats and incidents.  Prioritisation of threats in the Strategy is based on lessons learned from large-scale incidents.  Regular meetings of the Commission are used to determine the level of threat severity using a scale  of 1–3. There is no single international categorisation on threat criticality, although ENISA published  a study into threat characterisation (see below) which synthesises a range of different assessments.  It goes without saying that if a large incident has happened does not mean that this is a more or less  serious threat. Rather, a large scale incident bears some relevance to impact. There are also a few  other elements in this than threat priorities (e.g. vulnerabilities, protection level, etc.).  ENISA has also been playing a role in supporting implementation of European cyber security policy  by providing guidance on National Contingency Plans (NCPs) and National Cyber Security Strategies  (detailed below).  14 For example, a recent study found that across European countries, cyber security threats are characterised as high, major, prominent or  priority when compared to other national-level risks (for example terrorism, pandemics, natural disasters, state-on-state conflict and  nuclear war). See Robinson et al., forthcoming 2013.  15 For example, Belgium, Italy and the Czech Republic have recently introduced cyber security strategies and the formulation of a European  Cyber Security Strategy was released in February 2013  16 European Commission’s Communication on Critical Information Infrastructure protection (CIIP), http://eur- lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=COM:2009:0149:FIN:EN:PDF  National-level Risk Assessments  An Analysis Report  November 2013  Page  2  The Digital Agenda for Europe (European Commission 2010, p. 245) and the European Cyber Security  Strategy emphasise the increasingly interconnected nature of threats and their impact in  cyberspace, and accordingly advocate coordinated responses. The Strategy emphasises that cyber  threats are not EU-specific and cannot be overcome by the EU alone; rather, they can emanate from  and affect any part of the world. The 14 actions proposed in the Digital Agenda for Europe specify a  number of threats, including terrorist or politically motivated attacks against information systems  which form part of the critical infrastructures of the EU and its Member States.  In early 2013, ENISA published a threat landscape (ENISA 2013b), which classifies these threats  according to both the vector (for example, drive-by downloads, worms, trojans, exploit kits, botnets)  and threat agents. This distinction is important because it separates the ways or routes and the  agent behind them. The list of threat agents is described thus:   Corporations   Cybercriminals   Employees   Hacktivists   Nation states   Terrorists  Outside of the specific areas of cyber security, in 2009 the European Commission also published a  communication on a community approach to the prevention of natural and man-made disasters  (European Commission 2009) which sets out a number of measures to be included in a community  strategy for prevention of natural and man-made disasters. These measures were set out under four  main headings:   Creating the conditions for the development of knowledge-based disaster prevention  policies at all levels of government   Linking actors and policies throughout the disaster management cycle   Making existing instruments perform better for disaster prevention   Reinforcing international cooperation in the field of prevention  In addition, a 2010 European Commission Staff Working Paper on Risk Assessment and Mapping  Guidelines for Disaster Management (European Commission 2010) illustrates how Risk Assessment  can be used as a framework to aid in the management of civil contingencies.  Nonetheless, it may be observed that policy impetus revolves around three main topics:  (1) The importance of understanding and identifying the risks (risk assessment);  (2) The importance of preparedness17 (NCPs, national exercises, pan-European exercises, pre-  defined process and infrastructures);  (3) The importance of ‘lesson learning’ and cooperation.  2.1.1 The role of National Contingency Plans  In this section we will look at the role of National Contingency Plans (NCPs) in managing, responding  to and recovering from major CII incidents.  Critical information infrastructures are vulnerable to a variety of disruptions by both man-made  (where there is a directed threat, i.e., motivated adversaries who behave strategically or via human  error) and systemic risks (accidents or consequences of other risks or systemic failures). High-profile  17  For a definition and discussion on this subject please look at the Risk Preparedness paper that has been published by the  ENISA Working Group on Risk Management. Available here: http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/risk-management  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/risk-management  National-level Risk Assessments  An Analysis Report  November 2013  Page  3  examples include the cyber-attacks targeting South Korea in early 2013; the accidental severing of  submarine telecommunications cables in 2008 off the coast of Egypt and outages suffered in Syria in  2012 and 2013 and a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack against the Domain Name Service  (DNS) of Network Solutions in January 2009. While such events may be reduced through effective  risk management, it is virtually impossible to eliminate all risks. Successful contingency planning,  execution, and testing are thus essential to mitigate the risk of system and service unavailability.  ENISA is taking important steps to further this aim: in 2011, the Agency studied NCPs in several  countries and released a good practice guide.18 NCPs are the national-level interim structures and  measures to respond and recover services following major incidents that involve CIIs and that lead to  a crisis. NCPs include actions at all levels, from the technical to the operational/tactical, to the  strategic/political.  NCPs, also referred to as National NIS Cooperation Plans in the proposed NIS Directive,19 are the  national-level structures and measures to recover services following major crisis-inducing incidents  that involve CIIs.  The European Commission recognises the importance of national contingency planning in the  mitigation and recovery process, and acknowledges that this is a vital means for reinforcing EU  defence mechanisms for CII. In its Action Plan20 for enhancing the security and resilience of  European CII, the Commission points out the need to develop ‘national contingency plans and  organise regular exercises for large scale networks security incident response and disaster recovery,  as a step towards closer pan-European coordination. National/Governmental CERTs/CSIRTs may be  tasked to lead national contingency planning exercises and testing, involving private and public  sector stakeholders. The involvement of ENISA is called upon to support the exchange of good  practices between Member States’ (European Commission 2009).  Furthermore, Article 5.2 of the proposal for a NIS Directive released in February 2013 (European  Commission 2013a) also articulates the way a risk assessment should fit into an overarching strategy  and plan, namely that:  The national NIS strategy shall include a national NIS cooperation plan complying at least  with the following requirements  (a) A risk assessment plan to identify risks and assess the impacts of potential incidents;  (b) The definition of the roles and responsibilities of the various actors involved in the  implementation of the plan;  (c) The definition of cooperation and communication processes ensuring prevention,  detection, response, repair and recovery, and modulated according to the alert level;  (d) A roadmap for NIS exercises and training to reinforce, validate, and test the plan.  Lessons learned to be documented and incorporated into updates to the plan.  Figure 3 illustrates the potential actors and potential structures involved in an NCP based on ENISA’s  good practice guide.  18  More information is available at: www.enisa.europa.eu/c3e/nis-cooperation-plans  19  See Article 5 of the proposed NIS directive at: http://ec.europa.eu/digital-agenda/en/news/eu-cybersecurity-plan- protect-open-internet-and-online-freedom-and-opportunity-cyber-security  20  http://ec.europa.eu/digital-agenda/en/news/policy-critical-information-infrastructure-protection-ciip  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/c3e/nis-cooperation-plans http://ec.europa.eu/digital-agenda/en/news/eu-cybersecurity-plan-protect-open-internet-and-online-freedom-and-opportunity-cyber-security http://ec.europa.eu/digital-agenda/en/news/eu-cybersecurity-plan-protect-open-internet-and-online-freedom-and-opportunity-cyber-security http://ec.europa.eu/digital-agenda/en/news/policy-critical-information-infrastructure-protection-ciip  National-level Risk Assessments  An Analysis Report  November 2013  Page  4  Figure 3: National NIS Cooperation Plan Structures 21  Interim structures may involve the formation of committees and response teams (at various levels),  the initiation of secure, robust means and platforms for communication, possibly the assembly of a  crisis cell, and the involvement of different actors from the private sector(s) that have predefined  roles during the crisis response. For managing national and cross-country large-scale cyber incidents  (leading to crisis situations) it is necessary to have a proper NCP which includes international cyber  crisis cooperation. NCPs include actions at all levels – ranging from the technical, to the  operational/tactical, to the strategic/political.  The lifecycle of NCPs is depicted in Figure 4. Based on ENISA’s previous work on NCPs, the NCP  usually has a lifespan of 2–3 years depending on the size of the country and the complexity. It is  clear, though, in all cases that in the development lifecycle of NIS contingency plans and their  subsequent revisions the first step is to perform a thorough national NIS risk assessment. Other  steps include the design and deployment of the plans, the testing, training and exercising, and finally  the reviewing and auditing.  21  Good Practice Guide for National Contingency Plans for CIIP, ENISA, 2011.  National-level Risk Assessments  An Analysis Report  November 2013  Page  5  Figure 4: The lifecycle of national NIS contingency plans (source: ENISA Good Practice Guide on NCPs)  2.1.2 National policy initiatives  Across a range of EU and non-EU countries, there are some disparities in how CII / Cyber security  threats and risks are characterised with a wide variety of descriptions, scope and approaches across  each country (Robinson, 2013).  However, as the Impact Assessment accompanying the 2013 proposal for an NIS Directive shows,  many EU countries already have efforts such as adopting a national CERT, cyber exercises or have a  National Cyber Security Strategy. Nonetheless, some countries remain at a somewhat early level of  maturity in this area (European Commission 2013c).  2.1.3 Examples of international initiatives on risk assessment for cyber security  In 2012 the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) held a workshop on  national-level crisis planning and interagency coordination in partnership with the Swiss Federal  Chancellery.22  The key objective of the workshop was to facilitate transnational knowledge-sharing and to  encourage cross-sector partnerships through identification of best practice. This objective has also  been promoted through the OECD High Level Risk Forum, a venue for senior policy-makers and  22  Opening remarks by OECD Deputy Secretary-General Yves Leterme at the Joint OECD – Swiss federal Chancellery  Workshop on Inter-Agency Crisis Management 28 June 2012, Geneva, Switzerland available at  http://www.oecd.org/governance/risk/Speech%20DSG%20Leterme%20-final.pdf  http://www.oecd.org/governance/risk/Speech%20DSG%20Leterme%20-final.pdf  National-level Risk Assessments  An Analysis Report  November 2013  Page  6  industry executives to advance the international policy agenda for building resilience to large-scale  risks.  The discussions focused on improving risk management through international strategic cooperation  and exchange of best practices. It also addressed the issue of governance, emphasising the  importance of equipping national authorities with the right tools and institutional frameworks for  coordinated action and swift responses. OECD debate has also highlighted the need to engage senior  political leaders regarding investment in risk management capabilities in order to achieve practical  impact.23 Another good example of this sort is the World Economic Forum that runs a risk  management exercise and delivers a risk report for the Davos meeting of political leaders. It is  interesting to see how this (non NIS) based assessment is being conducted and how different voices  are unified under a number of certain contexts.  2.2 The role of ENISA  Created in 2004, ENISA acts as a centre of excellence for Member States and EU institutions on  network and information security issues, and has established itself as a key stakeholder in the  European cyber security community. ENISA has been at the forefront of supporting the work of EU  Member States and other relevant stakeholders in their efforts to develop and maintain NCPs for  CIIs. The first step towards this target was the preparation of a Good Practice Guide24 intended to  shape the development process of coordinated response and crisis management of large-scale CII  incidents. The Guide has helped facilitate the development of NCPs and their lifecycle, and has  helped EU Member States to develop, test, improve and maintain well-functioning NCPs. Since then,  the Agency has held numerous workshops across Europe to assist in the planning of national  exercises to help explore and strengthen NCPs.  ENISA is working on guidance for national cyber security strategies (NCSS).25 The Agency successfully  oversaw the coordination of the first pan-European cyber security exercises26 in November 2010,  Cyber Europe 2010. ENISA facilitated the second pan-European cyber exercise, Cyber Europe 2012,  which took place on 4 October 2012. As stated in the 2009 Commission Communication on Critical  Information Infrastructure Protection (European Commission 2009), the 2010 Digital Agenda  (European Commission 2010, p. 245) and the evaluation report of Cyber Europe 2010 (ENISA 2010),  exercises are deemed an important element of a coherent strategy for cyber-incident contingency  planning and recovery, both at national and European levels. It is in this context that the further  investigation of threat modelling and risk assessment for CII risks takes place.  ENISA has done considerable work on Risk Management over the last years. The full information  about this work can be found in a structured way at the Risk Management webpages at ENISA’s  website.27  23  ibid  24  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/cyber-crisis-cooperation/national-contingency-plans  25  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/national-cyber-security-strategies-ncsss  26  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/c3e  27 http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/risk-management  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/cyber-crisis-cooperation/national-contingency-plans http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/national-cyber-security-strategies-ncsss http://www.enisa.europa.eu/c3e  National-level Risk Assessments  An Analysis Report  November 2013  Page  7  3 Summary of Findings  In this chapter we present a summary of our findings from the empirical research. These findings are  structured according to the following broad subject areas:   Published open guidance for RAs   National context for cyber security   Implementation of National-level Risk Assessment  3.1 Existing guidance on Risk Assessment  From our targeted reviews we found several high-level guidance documents concerning the process  of establishing a National-level Risk Assessment. These range from generic guidance which applies to  Risk Analysis at the national level, to specific guidance looking at Critical Information Infrastructures  (CII). Below we summarise five of the publicly available guidance and documents relating to the  practice of risk analysis which the research team consider useful, as they are comprehensive and  cover the issues from a methodological or programmatic perspective. Our review identified some  useful guidance on the practice of risk assessment in the context of national and international risks,  but much of the Critical Information Infrastructure risk analysis guidance identified concerns risk  analysis in the context of organisational ICT risks, rather than national-level risk assessment. For  example, although many internationally available standards such as ISO 27005: 200828, ISO 15408:  200929 and ISO 31010:200930 contain guidance on risk analysis they are often framed at the system  or organisational rather than the national level. Of the five guidance documents summarised below  two are aimed at national-level assessment and two at the organisational level.  The International Risk Governance Council (IRGC) published a report in 2006 setting out an  integrated framework for how national-level risk analysis initiatives might be set up (International  Risk Governance Council 2005). It provides guidance for the development of comprehensive  assessment and management strategies to cope with risks. The framework is focused on those risks  with international implications which have the potential to harm human health and safety, the  economy, the environment and/or the fabric of society at large, but it is not on Information (cyber)  Risk Management. The IRGC report is instructive for its breadth of analysis of terminology, its focus  on the process of undertaking a national-level risk assessment, and the importance it places on  understanding the context and environment in which a risk assessment is conducted.  The Institute for the Protection of the Security of the Citizen (IPSC), part of the Joint Research Centre  (JRC) in Ispra, Italy, published a Technical Note containing a compendium of 19 different Risk  Analysis methodologies applicable at the national level in the context of Critical Infrastructure  Protection (CIP) (Giannopoulous et al. 2012). This finds that although there are a significant number  of risk assessment methodologies each with a common and linear approach (identification and  classification of threats, identification of vulnerabilities and evaluation of impact), there is a huge  difference between methodologies in their scope, intended audience and domain of applicability.  This report also finds that risk assessment methodologies can be further categorised by whether  they are for a particular sector or whether they take a systems approach.  Some guidance was identified on conducting cyber-security and CII-related Risk Assessments at the  organisational level. Examples include those from the US National Institute of Standards and  28  ISO/IEC 27005:2008 Information technology -- Security techniques -- Information security risk management  29  ISO/IEC 15408-1: 2009 Information Technology – Security Techniques – Evaluation Criteria for IT Security – Part 1:  Introduction and General Model  30  ISO/IEC 31010:2009 - Risk Management - Risk Assessment Techniques  National-level Risk Assessments  An Analysis Report  November 2013  Page  8  Technology (NIST) and the UK HMG Technical Risk Assessment IA Standard No. 1. In addition, ENISA  has an extensive inventory of the most common Risk Analysis methods. The catalogue isavailable on  ENISA’s website.31  In September 2012 NIST released a Guide for conducting Risk Assessments (NIST 2012). It notes that  risk assessment is done throughout an organisation. It indicates that there are no formal  requirements for a risk analysis, and organisations (by which is meant the US government) should  have maximum flexibility in applying guidance. Importantly, the limitations of risk analysis are  described, including that they are often not precise instruments of measurement, and that the  outputs are of course dependent upon the quality of information provided, the limitations of specific  methodologies, tools and techniques used and the subjectivity, trustworthiness and quality of the  data, the interpretation of results, and the skills and capabilities of individuals or groups conducting  the assessment.  The UK’s Technical Risk Assessment IA Standard No. 1 (issue 3.51) from 2009 (CESG & Cabinet Office  2009) is a component of the UK government’s policy framework and is intended to be used across  the public sector. It provides a framework for identifying, assessing and determining the level of risk  to an ICT system. This guidance is useful in including an understanding of the risk analysis lifecycle  (how it fits into the process of applying measures to manage the risk), as well as containing a  practical worked example.  The US National Academies of Science (NAS) evaluated the different risk analysis methods used in  the US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) in a report published in 2010.32 This found that  although a generally appropriate conceptual framework had been developed, no capabilities and  methods appeared adequate for supporting DHS decision-making with the exception of risk analysis  for natural disasters. It made a number of recommendations including improvements to the way in  which models are used following scientific practices, and building a strong culture of risk analysis.  3.2 National context for cyber security  In this section we summarise results from the fieldwork concerning the national context for cyber  security. The national context is important as it informs the work and outputs of any national risk  assessment programme. For example, without national-level policy ownership of these issues, the  results of a National-level Risk Assessment might go unheeded.  In some of the countries studied, cyber National-level Risk Assessments sometimes sit alongside risk  assessments done in other sectors. Figure 5 illustrates the national-level structures when this is the  case.  31  ENISA Inventory of Risk Management/ Risk Assessment Methods (2011) http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/risk- management/current-risk/risk-management-inventory/rm-ra-methods  32  Committee to Review the Department of Homeland Security’s Approach to Risk Analysis (2012) National Research  Council of the National Academies Review of the Department of Homeland Security’s Approach to Risk Analysis  Washington DC 2010  National-level Risk Assessments  An Analysis Report  November 2013  Page  9  Figure 5: Risk inputs to senior decision-makers  3.2.1 Countries having a National Cyber Security Strategy  A National Cyber Security Strategy (NCSS) may be considered as a key background component of a  National-level Risk Assessment. An NCSS should outline the role that the National-level Risk  Assessment plays and how it might contribute to prevention of crises. ENISA maintains an online  directory on NCSS across the world and undertook a study into NCSS in 2012 (ENISA 2013c).  Six countries consulted in the study have a specific NCSS (United Kingdom, Finland, Germany,  Estonia, the Netherlands and Switzerland) in place. In Finland, this has been released most recently  (January 2013) and is currently in its implementation phase. In Estonia, the strategy is being revised  at the time of writing. In Spain, the national Cyber Security Strategy has been developed by  representatives from the Ministry of the Interior, defence industry and the CNPIC (the National  Centre for Critical Infrastructure Protection) but is pending approval. In some other countries there  is no specific National Cyber Security Strategy, though in Sweden efforts are underway to develop  one. For comparison, Japan’s latest revision to its national Cyber Security Strategy was due in June  2013, having first been published in 2006.  3.2.2 Organisations with a mandate to address cyber security and /or CIIP  Next, we consider the presence of a designated cyber security organisation or authority in the  countries consulted in the study. National-level organisations with a responsibility to consider cyber  security are key stakeholders of a National-level Risk Assessment – either by conducting the  National-level Risk Assessment themselves or by providing assurance on risk assessments conducted  by other stakeholders (see below). Depending on the nature of the national-level organisation they  National-level Risk Assessments  An Analysis Report  November 2013  Page  10  may also have responsibility for CIIP, or responsibility may lie within a separate agency or even a  telecommunications regulator.  Across the countries on which information was collected, policy-level ownership of cyber security  and CIIP was held in different types of organisation. Some had a designated cyber security agency  (such as the Office of Cyber Security and Information Assurance (OCSIA) in the UK) whilst in others  the interior ministry, telecommunications regulator or other entity was responsible at the national  level for cyber security. Also, there are cases where cyber security responsibilities are shared among  a number of public entities, with no single designated authority. Understanding how the policy  ownership of cyber security works is important because the nature of the national-level body or  bodies with ownership of cyber security will inform what particular risks are prioritised and how the  risks need to be communicated for maximum impact.  In the UK the OCSIA works closely with lead departments and CCS to ensure that cyber security risks  are effectively represented in the National Risk Register.  In Estonia, a specific Information Systems Authority (Riigi Infosüsteemi Amet – RIA) is responsible for  covering cyber and information security. RIA is a sub-division of the Ministry of Economic Affairs and  Communications and its focus is on protection of information systems necessary for the functioning  of vital services. In Denmark, the national IT security authority resides in the Centre for Cyber  Security. The Centre is responsible for providing a threat analysis.  In France, the ANSSI (Agence nationale de la sécurité des systèmes d’information) was created in  2009 to address IT systems security across a number of vital sectors and to help the private sector  achieve security. ANSSI reports to the SGDSN (Secrétariate général de la défense et de la sécurité  nationale), which then reports to the Prime Minister.  In Germany, the German Federal Office for Information Security (BSI) currently acts as the national  security agency to promote IT security in the country. Alongside the Ministry of Interior and the UP- KRITIS33 PPP it conducts detailed work on threat and risk analysis.  In the United States, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has the federal mandate to tackle  the civilian aspects of CIIP under the vision set by the Executive Branch (the White House).  3.2.3 Other actors in cyber security collaboration  Actors in cyber security collaboration within the countries consulted in the study also include  ministries and government departments. In most countries consulted Ministries of the Interior are  responsible for civil protection, overall coordination and regulation of crises and emergencies and  often play an important part in cyber security collaboration. They may undertake coordination of the  national cyber security strategy or they may host centres to protect critical infrastructure, such as  the National Centre for Critical Infrastructure Protection in Spain. Ministries of Justice may also be  involved: for example, the Dutch National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) is part of the Ministry of  Safety and Justice and of the National Coordinator for Counterterrorism and Security (NCTV). In  Germany, a role is also played by the Federal Ministry of Economics and Technology and in the UK by  the Department of Business, Innovation and Skills (BIS). In South Korea, the National Intelligence  Service and the Ministry of Science, ICT and Future Planning are officially responsible for cyber  security.  33  Bundesministerium des Innern (2007) CIP Implementation Plan of the National Plan for Information Infrastructure  Protection (‘UP-KRITIS’) As of 13 October 2013:  http://www.bmi.bund.de/SharedDocs/Downloads/EN/Broschueren/2009/kritis.html  http://www.bmi.bund.de/SharedDocs/Downloads/EN/Broschueren/2009/kritis.html  National-level Risk Assessments  An Analysis Report  November 2013  Page  11  3.2.4 Examples of coordination among different actors in the cyber security arena  As cyber security is a cross-domain issue, in order to derive an accurate appreciation of the risks,  input must be taken from a range of entities in the public and private sector.  Most countries are aware of the importance of coordination with public and private sector actors,  even if they might not necessarily have a centralised national coordination authority. In Spain, for  example, the National Centre for Critical Infrastructure Protection (CNPIC) located within the Spanish  Ministry of the Interior is tasked with conducting RAs to evaluate physical and cyber threats and  works closely with public and private sectors (e.g. critical infrastructure managers). CNPIC also  communicates with the National Antiterrorism Coordination Centre, which provides CNPIC with risk  analyses that are then integrated into its assessments.  In the UK, the Department of Business, Innovation and Skills (BIS) is responsible for a significant part  of the cyber security strategy, especially with regard to issues concerning the private sector. The  Office of Cyber Security & Information Assurance (OCSIA) works in close cooperation with  Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ) and receives and analyses intelligence from  public sector agencies, allowing them to identify and prioritise threats.  In some countries the coordination function is performed by a specific cyber security centre. In  Japan, coordination between actors in cyber security is provided by the National Information  Security Center (NISC) which acts as a facilitator of information security efforts of government  agencies and a point of contact for international affairs. NISC coordinates Critical Infrastructure  sector-specific ministries, related organisations and designated sectors including, for example,  information and communications, finance, aviation, railways, etc. The ISPC (Information Security  Policy Council) is a supreme body for endorsing important cyber security policies. Similarly, the  National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) in the Netherlands performs a coordinating function between  government departments and between private and public sectors in a relatively decentralised  system where government departments and different private sector actors are responsible for  different aspects of cyber security.  In the United States, the Department for Homeland Security’s Office of Cyber Security and  Communications plays a role in regard to non-military critical infrastructure within US federal  efforts. This is under the auspices of the 2009 National Infrastructure Protection Plan (NIPP) and the  Executive Order from the White House of February 2013 (White House 2013). These are fed into the  US National Security Committee as the highest-level organisation responsible for analysing all  national-level risks to the United States. Within DHS, the Homeland Infrastructure Threat and Risk  Analysis Centre (HITRAC) performs risk analyses for the 16 critical infrastructures. DHS units link, via  a range of other mechanisms such as the Partnership for Critical Infrastructure Security (PCIS), sector  coordinating councils and Information Sharing and Analysis centres, to pull together a Risk Profile for  each Sector under the Critical Infrastructure Partnership Advisory Council CIPAC).  Some countries have set up a specific high-level cyber security council – a political body, including  members from different ministries. In Germany, the council receives some input from the PPP set up  in the country to share insights from practitioners’ perspectives. In Estonia, the Cyber Security  Council is a sub-council of the general-level Security Council and is responsible for approving cyber  security strategy. The Critical Information Infrastructure Protection (CIIP) Council which includes  representatives from both public and private sector reports to the Cyber Security Council. Both  councils meet regularly.  Coordinating efforts across different sectors have also been in place in Finland, where the national  cyber security strategy was coordinated by the Security Committee chaired by a senior civil servant  and including representatives from government ministries.  National-level Risk Assessments  An Analysis Report  November 2013  Page  12  3.2.5 The decentralised National-level Risk Assessment approach  Some countries have adopted decentralised approaches. In summary this approach is a different  way to undertake National-level Risk Assessment since it relies upon each actor completing their  part of the Risk Assessment in a decentralised fashion. Figure 6 outlines the differences between the  decentralised and centralised National-level Risk Assessment approach.  Figure 6: Decentralised and single methodology approach  The outcomes of these assessments then feed into the National-level Risk Assessment. A key aspect  is maximising consistency across the different assessments, as they may have been produced using  diverse methodologies.  Decentralised approaches are taken in Finland, Switzerland and Sweden, although information  sharing and close relationships between public and private sector shareholders are recognised as  important for risk analysis. In Finland, the practice of RA is devolved according to individual  organisations. There is no single set of ‘RA tools’ which are applied at the organisational level, nor a  ‘normative’ framework for risk analysis. In Switzerland, cyber risk is seen as an integral part of a  wider overall risk picture. Notable cooperation took place during the preparation of the National  strategy for Switzerland’s protection against cyber risks. On an operational level, MELANI (the  Reporting and Analysis Centre for Information Assurance), a coordination and reporting centre for  incidents, plays a key role.  In Sweden, the lead agency for RA is the Swedish Civil Contingencies Agency (MSB) which provides  nonbinding guidance and tools for others in a range of sectors to follow. PTS (the Swedish Post and  Telecom Authority), which regulates the post and telecommunications sector, performs RAs annually  in the area of CIIP using tools from the MSB. For counties and municipalities, a similarly  decentralised approach is taken with delegated authorities for crisis management activities and RA.  National-level Risk Assessments  An Analysis Report  November 2013  Page  13  There is a certain element of decentralisation also evident in the US approach, as each of the 16  critical infrastructures has its own sectoral body responsible for production of a risk assessment,  which may be driven by different requirements – e.g. if a sector is highly regulated then the  subsequent RA will be take on a similar character, perhaps being focused on issues of specific  interest to the regulator. Each RA is reported to be analysed and quantified in terms meaningful to  that particular sector.  3.2.6 Conclusions regarding the national context for cyber security  Among the 20 countries consulted as part of this study there are considerable differences  concerning which public administration has the policy responsibility (or is the ‘customer’) for risk  assessments undertaken in the domain of CII. Therefore, this is likely to have an impact upon how  the risk analysis is performed (what particular priorities are accorded to different aspects within it)  and the approach used to communicate the results of any National-level Risk Assessment to senior  decision-makers.  3.3 Overview of findings relating to National-level Risk Assessment  programmes  In this section we present the main findings from the research as they relate specifically to National- level Risk Assessment in this domain. We identify commonalities and variations in the approaches  for threat assessment, how countries have implemented their National-level Risk Assessment, key  challenges and lessons learned. Table 1 summarises all these, while Figure 7 illustrates the possible  inputs to the National-level Risk Assessment.  Aspect of implementation Variations / examples  Approaches to a National-level Risk  Assessment are either:  Through a formalised RA  By decentralised RAs  National-level methodologies can be based  on:  Scenario-based approaches  Qualitative or quantitative approaches  Combined approaches  Table 1: Summary of findings  National-level Risk Assessments  An Analysis Report  November 2013  Page  14  Figure 7: Possible inputs to the National-level Risk Assessment  Figure 8 illustrates the diversity of organisations reported in this study as having some kind of  involvement in National-level Risk Assessments. Which of these organisations might be involved is  sometimes quite dependent upon the national context. Other aproaches on this process have been  described by ENISA in its previous work on risk management34.  34  Risk Management process, http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/risk-management/current-risk/risk-management- inventory/rm-process  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/risk-management/current-risk/risk-management-inventory/rm-process http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/risk-management/current-risk/risk-management-inventory/rm-process  National-level Risk Assessments  An Analysis Report  November 2013  Page  15  Figure 8: Organisations analysed as having some kind of role in conducting National-level Risk Assessments  3.4 Approaches to threat modelling  In this section we will look at the different aspects of the threat modelling and characterisation,  including the terminology and approaches used.  3.4.1 Terminology in threat modelling  Definitions of specific terms differ across countries and sometimes also within countries. The  majority of countries under review have adopted their own definitions of key terms such as ‘threat’,  ‘vital services’; ‘strategic sectors’, ‘national security interests’; ‘risk’ and ‘critical risk’. However,  categorisation of threats may differ both between EU countries and between different sectors  within a country. Some countries have specific threat catalogues in place, though this does not  automatically mean they have a standard definition of what a threat is. Security objectives are in  some cases outlined in very generic terms. There is no single international categorisation on threat  criticality. In addition, for some countries threat assessment can be very sensitive.  3.4.2 Threats addressed in national security strategies  Cyber threats can be addressed in specific cyber security strategies or in more general national  security strategies. In the UK, the National Security Strategy (NSS) addresses threats and trends  relating to domestic and international security. This is informed by the National-level Risk  Assessment, which deals with accidental and deliberate types of risk (including cyber). Within the  strategy, ‘national security interests’ are defined broadly as ‘secure spaces within the UK’,  encompassing protection of UK well-being, infrastructure, way of life, etc. Cyber is identified as  ‘priority one’ risk, with other priority one risks including terrorism and state threats.  In Finland, a number of threat characterisations are included in the 2010 Strategy for Society  Security. These can be used to inform new regulations. The 2010 strategy does not identify any  specific ‘adversaries’, but the 2013 Cyber Security Strategy identifies a range of threats including  ‘hacktivism’; ‘cyber-criminality’; ‘cyber-terrorism’ and ‘cyber-espionage’.  The Swiss Cyber Strategy sets out definitions of terminology (e.g. ‘risk’ and ‘critical risk’). MELANI35  applies ‘thresholds’ when classifying risks by their probability but it tries to avoid thresholds where  possible due to the complexity of the risks. With regard to cyber risks, there is an emphasis on  qualitative assessments as quantitative assessments often relate to vulnerability, yet it is argued that  actual threat is more important than vulnerability in the cyber domain.  3.4.3 Scenario-based approaches  Several countries use scenario-based approaches to assess threats.  In Estonia, the importance of threats is determined based on two dimensions: (1) threats to a  defined list of vital services and (2) the Emergencies Act which describes an emergency situation.  One such emergency is defined as ‘a large scale cyber-attack’ and there is a response plan for this  scenario. With the help of public and private sector discussion, scenarios were formulated together  with response plans to different cyber attack scenarios.  35  MELANI – Reporting and Analysis Centre for Information Assurance http://www.melani.admin.ch/?lang=en  National-level Risk Assessments  An Analysis Report  November 2013  Page  16  In Germany, the Ministry of the Interior takes responsibility for threat assessments. For general  threats to critical infrastructure, a Public–Private Partnership (PPP) was set up under the UP-KRITIS  programme concerned with the operation of critical infrastructures such as transport, food, energy,  ICT, health, etc. To share problems/ threats from the practitioners’ perspective, this PPP inputs  information to the Ministry of the Interior. The PPP uses a scenario-based approach in which the  group considers potential responses to a threat scenario analysed on different levels. One of the  challenges is the complexity of finding an objective route to weigh/determine formal measures of  probability. Initiatives focus on the most important processes/services that should not be  interrupted, such as the financial sector or ICT.  3.4.4 Quantitative approaches  Unlike many EU countries, risk assessment in Japan is quantitative in nature. Risk Analysis is  conducted by a CIP Committee under the Information Security Policy Council (ISPC). The threat  model is structured around four kinds of threats. These are defined in the Second Action Plan for  Information Security of Critical Infrastructure and include: (1) Intentional factors (e.g. cyber attack);  (2) Non-intentional factors; (3) Disaster (i.e. external factors); (4) Impact from other sectors (e.g.  blackouts). The relevance of these four categories is evaluated annually. The model does not cover  detailed ‘sub-categorisation’ within these threat types. The model is used on two levels: (1) a service  level and (2) a verification level.  3.4.5 Qualitative approaches  Countries with a specific threat modelling technique in place tend to use qualitative models.  Qualitative assessments (although quantitative assessments of vulnerability are often made) are the  usual approach used by countries when deciding upon the significance of a threat. Qualitative  models with a broad range of threats are common in the Nordic countries and the Netherlands.  Some countries use the geographical scope of the consequences (e.g. local, regional, national  approach) to determine how critical a threat is.  In the Netherlands, different methodologies are used to characterise threats in different sectors and  departments. The NCSC threat model used during an annual cyber security risk assessment includes  state and non-state actors (terrorists, hacktivists, script kiddies, etc.). Threats are ranked using a  high-medium-low scoring system based on a qualitative assessment.  France places threats into three categories: espionage, destructive attacks and attacks on integrity.  In Denmark, the Danish Emergency Management Agency acts as a coordinating committee and  considers a broad spectrum of threats at the national level. The Agency focuses on consequences  and preparedness. The Danish model divides threats into: ‘nation state actors’ and ‘non-nation state  actors’. Faced with the latter (e.g. cyber-criminals), the Centre for Cyber Security manages  emergency recovery while the police are responsible for prosecutions.  Sweden uses an ‘all-hazards’ approach. The model looks at a wide range of threats which include  unauthorised use of information, eavesdropping and technical malfunctions of systems, intended or  unintended. Validation of threats takes place at the level of the Swedish Civil Contingency Board. It  might be so that a validation also, on a sub-level, could takes place within an sector. Risks are linked  to the five national values of protection established by the Swedish government. This analysis also  considers vulnerabilities and consequences.  3.4.6 Threat modelling under development  Some countries have not yet fully deployed a threat modelling methodology. For example, the  Spanish CNPIC has so far defined twelve strategic sectors and is currently developing a plan to  National-level Risk Assessments  An Analysis Report  November 2013  Page  17  address sector-specific threats. This plan will use a top-down methodology. CNPIC is collaborating  with ministries with sector-specific expertise (e.g. the Ministry of Industry) in order to identify  sector-specific threats. Once the plan is finalised, CNPIC will work with infrastructure operators.  3.4.7 Conclusions for threat modelling  Most of the countries that participated in this research used a qualitative understanding of the  threats, although there was an intricate quantitative model identified. Many countries split the  threat actor/agent from the attack means/vector.  It should be stressed that more work is needed in the area of cyber threat modelling; current  approaches are developed in an ad-hoc manner and insular. Currently, there is no clear standard or  practices in place. This may be a direct result of the very fast-changing threat landscape, as  highlighted by ENISA’s reports (see ENISA 2013b).  3.5 Approaches to Risk Assessment  In this section we summarise what risk analysis methodologies have been deployed by the  participants in the research. In some cases we gained detailed information on specific  methodologies deployed.  3.5.1 RA strategy  National-level Risk Assessments  An Analysis Report  November 2013  Page  18  Some of the countries analysed have a formalised National-level Risk Assessment framework in  place. As an example, in the UK the National-level Risk Assessment informs responses to security  threats. The National-level Risk Assessment is approved by both ministers and chief scientists. The  success of the National-level Risk Assessment in the UK model depends on the ‘buy-in’ of a range of  government departments. The National-level Risk Assessment does not focus on private sector  issues such as companies’ vulnerability. Management of specific risks, in turn, is owned by the  department or agency with relevant expertise in that area. When a department ‘owns’ a risk, it is  responsible for reviewing and updating it in the National-level Risk Assessment on an annual basis,  as well as for risk mitigation. Where risk ownership is unclear, the Cabinet Office is the default  owner. The NCSS addresses impact on business, national security threats, awareness, cybercrime,  etc. Figure 9 outlines how these mechanisms work between different organisations.  In Estonia, the Ministry of the Interior prepares a single restricted document based on RA carried out  by critical services every year. This RA is sent off to relevant ministries and agencies which synthesise  the results. Different ministries and public sector agencies play a crucial role in reviewing the  statements of different vital service providers to ensure correct reporting. Specific glossaries are  used to ensure consistent usage of terminology.  3.5.2 Decentralised RA  The Nordic countries and Switzerland have a more decentralised RA devolved to individual  organisations. There is no single set of ‘RA tools’ to apply at the organisational level, or a ‘normative’  framework for RA. Cyber risk may be seen as a part of a wider overall risk picture.  In Sweden, the lead agency in RA is the Swedish Civil Contingencies Agency (MSB) which provides  mandates for other sectoral organisations. Sweden has a decentralised approach whereby sectors  are responsible for drawing up an RA. In Denmark, RA is the responsibility of each  telecommunications company as a national-level RA is deemed unviable. It is worth noting that a  similar situation exists in Japan, where telecommunications operators and industries use different  RA models with a range of terms and definitions. There is no unified RA model as separate sectors  face distinct types of risk. RA takes place every 1–2 years as part of a Plan, Do, Check, Act (PDCA)  cycle.  Figure 9: Interactions between public and private sector in the NRA process  National-level Risk Assessments  An Analysis Report  November 2013  Page  19  3.5.3 Conclusions for approaches to Risk Assessment  There are a variety of approaches taken to RA on a spectrum of centralised to decentralised models.  This may be driven by prevailing contextual factors in a particular country; for instance, the extent to  which other stakeholders can be required to follow a particular standard for National-level Risk  Assessments or whether this could be successfully accomplished using ‘softer’ policy mechanisms.  Further research is required to assess which of the approaches best fit specific national-level risk  mitigation strategies. National-level cyber risk assessment is still an emergent activity which will  require a number of iterations in order to truly define best practices. Initiatives such as this study, by  providing an overview of existing approaches, could well lead to better risk assessments in the  future.  3.6 National-level RA methodologies in use  RA methodology differs from country to country, with some countries consulted in the study not  using a formalised methodology. Figure 10 illustrates the main differences between the various  methodologies reported in use.  Figure 10: Examples of quantitative, hybrid and qualitative approaches  3.6.1 Scenario-based approach  A scenario-based approach is an RA methodology used by some countries in our research. In the UK,  RA is undertaken as part of a three-stage process based on a scenario-focused approach: (1)  departments and agencies provide information on scenarios; (2) a cross-government discussion  follows to determine whether these are the appropriate scenarios to be considered (this  consultation involves chief scientists and policy/ economics/ intelligence experts) and (3) scenarios  are finally assessed according to impact and plausibility.  Measuring impact and plausibility: case of the UK Impact is measured in terms of casualties,  fatalities, economic harm (reduced GDP), social disruption and psychological impact. Measuring  impact involves the risk owner and other government departments with relevant expertise and/or  likely to be most affected by the scenario. Plausibility is determined by intelligence from other  National-level Risk Assessments  An Analysis Report  November 2013  Page  20  government authorities. This criterion uses a logarithmic scale to determine the order of magnitude  ranging from 1 in 2 to a 1 in 20,000 likelihood.  The private sector facing element of the RA is carried out by the Centre for Protection of National  Infrastructure (CPNI), which operates on a more asset-based model, identifying critical assets  Adapting this to the cyber context might be challenging as it requires a more systems-based, rather  than asset-based approach (due to the complex interdependencies in cyberspace). Lastly, the Civil  Contingencies Secretariat (CCS) concentrates on supporting government efforts around RA,  preparation and planning, response and recovery, and resilience.  In the telecommunications sector, Denmark also uses a scenario-based approach. The RA for this  sector includes probabilistic events (accidents, natural catastrophes, etc.) in a handful of online  scenarios. Within each scenario, guidance is provided on how to act in each situation but there is no  explanation for the primary reasons why an attack may occur.  In the US, in the civilian domain, the HITRAC program and the Risk and Modelling and Simulation  Unit in the DHS provide a risk estimate which is expressed in qualitative risk pairs (a list of each risk  with its consequence and likelihood). These risk pairs cover an all-hazards approach (including  accidents and natural disasters) and cover both physical and cyber-related risks.  Qualitative and quantitative tools in Sweden. In Sweden, a combination of qualitative and  quantitative tools are used to assess risks related to particular scenarios with regard to  consequences and the likelihood of a similar event occurring in Sweden. Scenarios are developed  according to criteria that include over 20 context-forming variables such as location, time and area  of impact. Impact of the threat is then categorised (if possible) according to the geographic scope of  the consequences (local, regional, national) and the duration of the disruption. These details are  then used to estimate the overall impact on the sector. Additionally, societal consequences are  assessed according to a 5-grade scale. These are expressed in qualitative terms. The Swedish  national risk assessment also covers antagonistic threats. Disruptions to electronic communications  have been identified as one of 27 particularly serious (national) events that are gradually being  subjected to more in-depth analysis.  3.6.2 Combination of different approaches  Some countries combine different approaches in their RA methodology, often inspired by  methodologies used in different countries and based on standards adopted internationally. In  Estonia, the RA methodology is based on guidelines from the Ministry of the Interior which are in  turn based on different methodologies and various international standards adapted to the Estonian  case; for example BS 25999 (now ISO 22301),36 ISKE37 and the German BSI standards.38 Five levels of  probability measures are defined and used in the RA guide.  In Switzerland, the Swiss Office of Civil Protection has designed a toolkit to go alongside the National  Strategy for Switzerland’s protection against cyber risks. It takes known ISO methodologies and  combines them with those in the German handbook for critical infrastructure. The toolkit does not  36  ISO, ‘ISO 22301: 2012’, Standards catalogue.

The MELANI  approach uses sector-specific standards for RA, depending on the scenario.  The new RA framework in France is based on a well-established organisational level RA approach  known as EBIOS (ANSSI 2010) focused on physical security that looks at the sector, seeks to identify  threats and design how best address them. Cyber is integrated in all the different models/ sectors (a  specified number of sectors and sub-sectors including energy, transport and defence). Each sector  evaluates risks at three levels: macro, mid and micro. A qualitative approach is taken to determine  the most important risks. Precise probabilities are not used. The same methodology is used for every  type of RA at both the micro and macro levels. The importance of updating risk assessments to  ensure they stay relevant is recognised in this context.  3.6.3 Other approaches and work in progress  In some cases, there is a perception that a national RA methodology is less of a priority than dealing  with pan-European problems (e.g. pan-European computer incidents). Despite the lack of a national  risk framework for cyber, significant technical work carried out by CERTs may still prove useful, as in  the case of Portugal.  In another country we studied, the RA is based on the predicted impact on different processes in the  critical sectors. During discussions on RA within the multi-stakeholder discussion group, however,  neither ‘risk’, nor ‘impact’ were said to be clearly defined in this country. RA practitioners used  interviews, brainstorming and discussion to determine threats. They focused on listening to industry  advisors’ recommendations as the best way to gain an accurate sense of the risk landscape. In this  particular country, operators are expected to assess their own risks.  In many countries the development of an RA methodology may be considered a work in progress.  The Spanish CNPIC is working on a three-point impact assessment to evaluate:  (1) impact on personnel (casualties);  (2) impact on national economy;  (3) environmental impact;  (4) impact on the society wellbeing.  The Centre has identified five thresholds which are classified and measured quantitatively. CNPIC  personnel are currently taught to use ‘Magerit’, a risk assessment methodology used predominantly  in the public sector, publicly available in Spanish.39 This methodology is primarily used to assess  probability.  3.6.4 Conclusions for methodologies used  There are a variety of methodologies deployed for RA, including those using qualitative and  quantitative methods. Some countries have adopted a hybrid approach whilst other countries are at  an emergent stage with respect to the choice of a particular methodology.  3.7 Key challenges from national experiences  Interviewees and questionnaire respondents were asked to identify what they perceived to be the  key challenges facing their country in relation to national-level RA for cyber security. The following  were the most commonly mentioned: (1) lack of harmonised legal framework; (2) incomplete and  39  Ministerio de Administraciones Publicas (Spanish Ministry for Public Administrations) (2005) Magerit v.2 As of 13  October 2013: http://www.csi.map.es/csi/pg5m20.htm  http://www.csi.map.es/csi/pg5m20.htm  National-level Risk Assessments  An Analysis Report  November 2013  Page  22  diverse risk assessment methodologies; (3) getting a comprehensive understanding of threats; (4)  effective risk management and preparedness; (5) insufficient information sharing. Below we  describe the nature of the problem as characterised by those participating in the research.  3.7.1 Lack of harmonised legal framework for cyber security  This barrier to a more effective cyber security system takes various forms. Most commonly,  countries have adopted different definitions, or only vague definitions of key terms such as ‘critical  information infrastructure’, ‘risk’, ‘threat’, or ‘priority risks’, etc., which can hinder an effective  harmonisation of risk assessment. Risk assessment is often decentralised and different RA tools are  provided by different (sometimes private) providers. With no harmonised legal framework, it is  difficult to talk about minimum standards. Moreover, opinions differ among countries as to the  usefulness of a minimum standards requirement or minimum level of maturity to implement  National-level Risk Assessment.  3.7.2 Incomplete and diverse risk assessment methodologies  The diversity of methods used in RA process by different countries was reported by participants to  pose a serious challenge to a coherent pan-European cyber security approach. In some countries,  different sectors have their own priorities and there is no unified method to prioritise risk; others  use an ‘all-hazards’ approach. Some participants argue that an all-hazards approach might not be the  most effective as it covers a wide range of different types of risks which are very diverse and could,  potentially, be better dealt with in clusters. However, ‘clustering’ presents its own challenges as it  raises questions about how to group/model actors’ intentionality of threat. Additionally, participants  mentioned methodological challenges in measuring the value of assets, economic costs, providing  gross assessments of likelihood of threat for scenario-based RA and prioritising systems that need  protection. RA methodology should be continually reviewed and updated to include new  information on new threats. Reconciling different risk assessment practices and standards across  companies may also be difficult.  France and EBIOS. It was reported that France is currently reviewing its EBIOS methodology (which  is consistent with the ISO27005:2008 Information Technology – Security Techniques – Information  Security Risk Management) Specification for an Information Security Management System) to make  it more suitable for use at a national level. This is an example of how methodologies might be  revisited as countries get more sophisticated in their National-level Risk Assessment programmes.  3.7.3 Lack of comprehensive methods to assess threats  A key challenge reported by respondents is assessing threats and how they affect public/private  sectors and society. A better understanding of threats leads to a better understanding of risk.  Identifying cyber risks has been highly challenging due to both the large scope of threats and risks  and the immediacy of current threats, which lead cyber security actors to favour a more reactive  approach. But such a reactive approach may have partly prevented development of a more  comprehensive threat model. To enhance countries’ understanding of threats, it was suggested that  a common taxonomy of threats in the electronic communications sector shared by all countries in  the EU could be developed. As part of the RA, some mechanism to determine likelihood could be  developed for threat actors, particularly those with hostile intent.  3.7.4 Need for effective risk management and preparedness capacity and skills  Participants reported that consultation on cyber security and CII risks often involves working through  a scientific advisory committee to address best sources of evidence and to build in an independent  scientific review base. In terms of risk preparedness, this differs between organisations, and often  National-level Risk Assessments  An Analysis Report  November 2013  Page  23  depends on the amount of RA training they have received – particularly among vital service  providers. For a sustainable level of preparedness, staff should be trained and competent to carry  out the RA. Skilled and competent staff may, however, be difficult to find for every operator.  3.7.5 Information sharing  Various forms of information sharing have been proposed and tried in different countries, though  many carry with them significant challenges.40 Furthermore, opportunities to learn lessons from  other countries are reportedly often hampered by budget limitations and difficulties in obtaining  cyber information from operators. A key challenge identified by participants is how to coordinate  the different perspectives of sectors and organisations and ensure better information sharing. One  country reported the use of careful vetting and cooperative agreements to permit information to be  pushed from government to the private sector.  3.7.6 Conclusions on key challenges from national experiences  The lack of a harmonised framework for cyber security could be considered as a key challenge  (especially with regard to terminology) in addition to the diversity and relative uncertainties of  current methodologies. Other key challenges were of a more systematic nature that affect many  aspects of cyber security, including information sharing.  3.8 Lessons identified by respondents  3.8.1 Assimilating best practices and learning from international cooperation  One of the main lessons which respondents from several countries reported that they had learnt  was recognising how useful international cooperation can be and how countries can learn from one  another. Respondents from several countries recommended looking at good examples in Nordic  countries which have experience in dealing with natural disasters, have published risk confidence  indicators and have developed exercises that bridge intentions and actions. Some countries have  also experienced fruitful cooperation with the US and Canada. Visiting centres in countries with  relatively advanced CI capabilities such as the UK, Germany, US, Canada, France, Japan and the  Netherlands has provided some countries with valuable best practice experience as they set up their  own National-level Risk Assessment capabilities.  Several respondents expressed a preference for learning best practices from each other rather than  imposing a single methodology at the EU level. The UK, for example, has recognised the importance  of engaging with international stakeholders within the EU and OECD networks. The UK reported that  this involved sharing best practice in identifying and assessing risk, for example through organising a  summer 2013 conference among nations with relatively mature RA programmes to share  experience; liaising with insurance companies and drawing on their advanced RA methods and using  OECD research for examples of effective and ineffective approaches across a range of countries.  It was reported that the national RA in Sweden was inspired by a review of national risk assessments  undertaken by the UK, Norway, the Netherlands and Canada. There is also an ongoing exchange of  experiences from national risk assessments with other countries, the effectiveness of which was  reported to be improving.  40  Creation of PPPs in cyber security, for example, can be problematic as detailed information sharing in this context may  be difficult due to the sensitivity and difficulty of obtaining information.  National-level Risk Assessments  An Analysis Report  November 2013  Page  24  The respondent from one large EU Member State reported using best practice from other countries  in a number of ways and considered this to be a very good way to support cyber security. More  specifically, the use of ENISA good practice guides (e.g. the NSIE guide) and some guides from other  Member States were highlighted by this respondent.  In terms of knowledge exchange once a programme is underway, the French ANSSI works with other  international programmes and shares methodologies with them through systematic international  collaborative platforms.  3.8.2 Relationships with the public and private sector  An effective cyber security system requires effective relationships among private and public sector  actors. These can be nurtured through, for example, meetings with vital service providers as  problems arise and particularly through good information sharing. A collaborative approach is  deemed crucial to drive progress. For example, for the French ANSSI, it was reported that one of the  main lessons learned was that a PPP is needed in addition to formal policy-making in order to build a  strong relationship with the private sector. In the US, a key aspect noted to demonstrate to the  private sector the business case of good cyber security practices concerned replacement of legacy  equipment used in critical infrastructures. Conducting a National-level Risk Assessment was  articulated as beneficial because of the fact that technologies likely to replace legacy equipment  would be more reliant upon networks such as the public Internet.  3.8.3 Context-specific emergency responses and CI protection approaches  A frequently learnt lesson among the studied countries was reported to be that effective emergency  responses and CI protection approaches have to be context-specific and that attempting to replicate  other countries’ approaches completely is not useful. Countries have important differences in  legislation, culture and societal structure which have to be considered for any new initiative such as  a National-level Risk Assessment programme to work well.  3.8.4 Conclusions on lessons learnt  Many countries are seeking to draw lessons from others in establishing or deploying a National-level  Risk Assessment programme. The role of international platforms such as ENISA and the OECD would  appear to be helpful in this regard, especially if the work done complements each other. As with  many other cyber security issues, establishing good cooperation with the private sector and making  sure that responses take account of contexts were also seen as important lessons identified, if not  learnt.  3.9 Suggestions from Member States for National-level Risk Assessment  development  In this final section we report findings about how countries participating in this research are  considering onward development of National-level Risk Assessment efforts. An analysis of interview  and questionnaire responses indicates that countries have recognised the following to be the key  areas to address in the development of a National-level Risk Assessment: (1) greater understanding  of threats and their effects on society; (2) better management of incidents; (3) greater stakeholder  involvement and information sharing; (4) improved national CIIP frameworks and (5) guidelines on  the EU level.  National-level Risk Assessments  An Analysis Report  November 2013  Page  25  3.9.1 Greater understanding of threats and their effects on society  Most countries would like to focus on developing a better understanding of threats and how they  affect public and private sectors and society more broadly. In practice at the national level, this  would involve, for example, developing a good threat assessment mechanism that pulls together  both threats and risks, creation of a cyber security centre to collect and share information on  information security breaches, making risk analysis available to every system with a critical mission  and focusing on understanding the rationale behind attacks.  3.9.2 Better management of incidents  Together with improving their understanding of threats, countries also recognise the need to  improve the management of incidents. It was suggested that within the next 12–18 months there  ought to be a robust understanding of risk and mitigation priorities. A specific suggestion from one  respondent involved handling ‘rare events’ by developing a 20-year horizon scanning exercise that  would resemble national risk assessment but could give a sense of alternative future scenarios.  3.9.3 Greater stakeholder involvement and information sharing  In the short to medium term, some EU countries expressed a desire to see involvement of more  stakeholders such as SMEs in the process of RA and improving the cross-sectoral dialogue through  PPPs. Most emphasised they would like to focus on bringing entities together particularly to share  information on effective mitigation strategies. Another participant mentioned that the conduct of  sector-specific table-top or regional exercises should be seen as a priority in order to help broaden  the number of stakeholders.  3.9.4 Improved national CIIP frameworks  Several countries have specific steps in mind to improve their national CIIP frameworks. For  example, one seeks to establish a framework that ensures that problems faced by operators (such as  governance and systems management) are addressed effectively and operators are able to connect  with their management to raise visibility of risks. This framework should also improve impact  mapping. Others aim to develop a new RA model which would be more qualitative and would better  consider sector interdependencies or seek to implement a strategy that will provide more resources  to existing structures and ensure that government bodies understand and implement their  mandates in the cyber area. There are other examples that want to combine legislation in an  information society code, and others would like to focus more on including cross-border dimensions  in their RA. One country in particular noted the difficulty of translating RA guidance and capacity  building tools (e.g. self-assessments & training) from the organisational level to sector and then to  national level.  3.9.5 EU guidelines and support  Several countries would like to see ENISA establishing a list of the most important cyber risk  scenarios. They would also like to see the establishment of an international protocol for sharing  information on best practices for National-level Risk Assessments, as suggested by one large EU  Member State with reference to the role of the OECD.  3.9.6 Conclusions on reported national-level priorities for National-level Risk Assessment  programmes  As we have seen, there was a great deal of diversity with regard to the suggestions and avenues for  improvement, including: a greater understanding of threats and their effects upon society; better  management of incidents; greater stakeholder involvement and improved national CIIP frameworks.  National-level Risk Assessments  An Analysis Report  November 2013  Page  26  Suggestions for the EU level were also proposed, such as the creation of scenario catalogues and  provision of guidelines.  National-level Risk Assessments  An Analysis Report  November 2013  Page  27  4 Conclusions and recommendations  4.1 Conclusions  Concerning national cyber security contexts, we see that there is a great deal of diversity which can  make it challenging to provide guidance that would work in all situations. However, this diversity  might be seen as a strength, since there might be more adverse consequences for cyber security at  the EU level if each country had the same National-level Risk Assessment approach; flaws in the  approach would be magnified resulting in extensive policy vulnerability. Understanding national  context is likely to have a positive effect upon how the risk analysis is performed (what particular  priorities are accorded to different aspects within it) and the best approach to communicate results  to senior decision-makers.  Most of the countries that participated in this research used a qualitative or categorical  understanding of the severity of risks (low, medium, high) although there were some that had  developed quantitative models (e.g. a risk is severe if it affects 1 in 20,000 people). Many countries  split the threat actor/agent from the attack means/vector.  We see that there are a diverse variety of types of implementation adopted on a spectrum of  centralised to decentralised approaches. This seems to be driven by prevailing contextual factors in a  particular country; for instance, the extent to which other stakeholders can be required to follow a  particular standard for National-level Risk Assessments or whether this could be successfully  accomplished using ‘softer’ policy mechanisms.  We can see that there are a variety of RA methodologies deployed, including those using qualitative  or narrative and quantitative (numerical or mathematical) methods. Some countries have adopted a  hybrid approach. Other countries are at an emergent stage with respect to the choice of a particular  methodology.  Some key challenges identified include the perception of a lack of a harmonised framework for cyber  security (especially with regard to terminology) and the diversity and relative uncertainties of  current technical methodologies to perform National-level Risk Assessments. This latter point seems  in part to support the evidence generated by this study which aims to provide guidance on the  establishment of a National-level Risk Assessment methodology and programme. Other key  challenges included those relating to issues of a more systematic nature that affect cyber security,  including information sharing.  Many countries are seeking to draw lessons from others regarding establishing or deploying a  National-level Risk Assessment programme. The role of international platforms such as ENISA and  the OECD would appear to be helpful in this regard. As with many other cyber security issues,  establishing good cooperation with the private sector and making sure that responses take account  of contexts were also seen as important lessons identified, if not learnt.  Regarding priorities suggested by participants, there was some diversity with regard to the  suggestions and avenues for improvement including: a greater understanding of threats and effects  upon society; better management of incidents; greater stakeholder involvement and improved  national CIIP frameworks. Suggestions for EU-level action were also proposed, such as the creation  of scenario catalogues.  4.2 Recommendations  In this section we present our recommendations building upon relevant documents reviewed and  the evidence summarised in this report from interviewees and questionnaire.  National-level Risk Assessments  An Analysis Report  November 2013  Page  28  Recommendation 1: Member States should focus on achieving a better understanding of threats  and consequences for society  Member States are recommended to improve their understanding of threats and their impacts upon  society by, for example, improving threat analysis mechanisms, creation of appropriate  organisational structures to fuse intelligence and disseminating the results of risk analysis to owner- operators of systems with a critical mission.  Recommendation 2: Member States should integrate National-level Risk Assessment into the  lifecycle of their NIS cooperation plans and structures  It is recommended that Member States focus upon better integration of national-level risk analysis  and management into the cyber incident mitigation priorities, especially in the context of national- level NIS cooperation plans, procedures and structures. The suggestion of further development of  horizon scanning could be taken forward at the national level. Specific actions include considering of  cross-sector dependencies in National-level Risk Assessment models and frameworks establishing  National-level Risk Assessment training and self-assessment measures at sector and national levels.  Recommendation 3: Member States should expand stakeholder involvement and information  sharing  The question of how to encourage information exchange between different actors relevant to the  execution of National-level Risk Assessments is an important one but there is no easy answer.  Member States are recommended to consider the use of different mechanisms (for example,  sectoral exercises) to discover fruitful avenues to encourage information exchange. This  recommendation could be achieved over the short to medium term.  Recommendation 4: ENISA should develop, test and continuously mature a step-by-step guide for  running National-level Risk Assessment Programmes  The evidence gathered in this study, including the outcomes of the panel session during the 2nd  International Conference on Cyber Crisis Cooperation and Exercises,41 indicate there is a clear need  for a practical guide to aid Member States with their National-level Risk Assessment programmes.  Our recommendation is thus that a step-by-step guide on how to perform a National-level Risk  Assessment should be developed by ENISA, tested and maintained. Such a step-by-step guide should  be piloted with an EU Member State which is at the start of embarking upon efforts to more formally  assess cyber security risks. Such a pilot would set out to trial the use of the guide. Evaluation  questions should be specified at the start of the pilot including:   Who used the guide (in terms of what level of civil servant or administrator)?   What did users like about it? What did users dislike about it?   Where was it most effective? And where was it least effective?   How long did the National-level Risk Assessment programme take to set up when using the  guide?   How many people did it take to run the National-level Risk Assessment programme using the  Guide?   What would you have done differently?   Are there any issues not covered by the guide which would have been useful to have been  included?  41  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/ccce-conference  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/ccce-conference  National-level Risk Assessments  An Analysis Report  November 2013  Page  29  Recommendation 5: ENISA should establish a catalogue of scenarios to help Member States with  their National-level Risk Assessments  A set of potential cyber threat scenarios could be used by Member States as an off-the-shelf effort  to help either kick-start National-level Risk Assessments (for those at the start of the process of  setting one up) or for those Member States looking to gather more scenarios or validate existing  scenarios. This catalogue could act as a catalyst to help decision-makers get to grips quickly with  understanding risks in a controlled ‘safe’ environment. Work towards this direction that is already  being done by ENISA in the areas of the cyber threat landscape,42 cyber exercises43 and incident  reporting44 could be used to develop and maintain such a catalogue.  Recommendation 6: A community of practitioners with interest in cyber National-level Risk  Assessment should be established by the European Commission  Given the appetite expressed among participants for learning from other countries, another  recommendation is to use the momentum gained during the execution of this study to nurture an  informal network of National-level Risk Assessment practitioners. This network could share practices  and experiences relating to designing, running and operating National-level Risk Assessments in the  area of cyber security and CIIP. The establishment of an information-sharing protocol could support  this community of interest. The European Commission instruments, such as the NIS Platform45,  would be the most appropriate to implement his recommendation.  Recommendation 7: Exchanging practices in other cross-border risk domains should be reinforced  within for example the European Commission’s NIS Platform and other activities organised by  ENISA  Finally, there are other European institutions that perform similar functions to cyber National-level  Risk Assessment in other domains where risks have a cross-border implication. Examples include the  European Agency for Operational Cooperation at the External Borders of the EU (Frontex), some of  the EU’s financially orientated agencies (e.g. the European Central Bank), European Centre for  Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) in the domain of public health and many others. The  exchange of perspectives with experts from these other domains and institutions will yield valuable  insights into how to support and better facilitate national-level Risk Analysis in a cross-border  context across Member States. ENISA’s and the European Commission’s NIS Platform (see previous  recommendation) would be in position to implement this recommendation.  42  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/risk-management/evolving-threat-environment  43  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/c3e  44  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/Incidents-reporting  45  http://ec.europa.eu/digital-agenda/en/news/nis-platform-kick-meeting-working-groups  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/risk-management/evolving-threat-environment http://www.enisa.europa.eu/c3e http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/Incidents-reporting http://ec.europa.eu/digital-agenda/en/news/nis-platform-kick-meeting-working-groups  National-level Risk Assessments  An Analysis Report  November 2013  Page  30  Bibliography and further reading  ENISA papers  ENISA (2013a).

Research Outline  At this stage of the project ENISA aims to:  (i) examine empirical evidence on national-level risk assessment and threat modeling for  Critical Information Infrastructures (CII) across European Union Member States  (ii) outline risk assessment methodology principles in use by EU Member States that may  prove exemplary to others or highlight challenges  Research Deliverable and Approach  The aim of this project is to develop a National Risk Assessment Methodology which could be used  by EU Member States. The European Network and Information Security Agency, supported by RAND  Europe, is seeking to conduct semi-structured interviews with experts within EU Member States  involved in the cyber-security and CII risk assessment fields in order to understand key drivers of  these countries’ methodologies, policies and approaches that may be valuable to others.  This initial  phase consists of policymaker interviews supported by documentary analysis. Given your role in the  network and information security field in your country and the breadth of your experience, we  would be grateful for your input at this initial phase.  We propose a short interview with you in  person/by telephone addressing the following areas:   National co-ordination across cyber-security   Threat modelling characterisation   Approach to risk assessment   Key challenges and next steps  This annex contains further detail on the broad questions that are relevant to these areas.  We are  available to organise a meeting in person or by telephone and look forward to hearing from you.  Key topics  National co-ordination across cyber-security   Which is/are the organisation(s) which has/have the lead in your country in (i) developing  the national cyber-security strategy and (ii) outlining cyber-security threats and risks?   What national-level institutions have responsibility for contributing to threat modelling and  risk assessment in CII?   What are their competences (e.g. inter-agency unit; ministry of Interior; law enforcement;  national intelligence agency)?   How do the lead authority(s) co-ordinate other units with responsibilities in cyber-security  domestically?  How does the lead authority co-ordinate other units with co-ordinating cyber-  security bodies internationally? What learning has been undertaken with regard to risk  assessment and threat modelling methodologies?  National-level Risk Assessments  An Analysis Report  November 2013  Page  37  Threat modelling characterisation   How are threat actors modelled within current methodologies? What typologies are used?  (cf. nation-state; ideological; organised crime)   What decision processes drive the inclusion of these threat actors? Upon what rationale  were they included?   What process / mechanisms / models are used to characterise threat (expert analysis;  computational model; other) and why?   How is the severity of impact of these threat actors’ actions measured?  Upon what basis is  an understanding and ranking of severity developed?   What is the influence of other Member State frameworks on characterisation of threat?  Approach to risk assessment   How are lessons identified and learnt from the conduct of threat assessments across other  national-level concerns (cf. crime, terrorism)? What definitions of key terms are used (for  example risk) and why were these chosen?   What approaches to risk are taken (cf. quantitative/qualitative/mixed)   What tools and methodologies are used to assess risk?  What is the rationale for  use/rejection of specific tools?   What is the influence of other states’ tools on the risk assessment approach used?   Is your national methodology public? If so, could you please share it with us?   Are the results of the assessment made public (partially or in full)?   If the assessment result is not public, how are the risk owners involved?  Key challenges and next steps   What are the key challenges faced in threat modelling and risk assessment?   How do the model and assessment approach used account for and relate to wider National  Security priorities?   What is the frequency, process and depth of review of risk assessment and threat models  following implementation?   How do the risk assessment models affect levels of funding and balance of resource  prioritisation?   What is the maturity of the model used and how do you see it developing? What examples  of best practice can you offer to others?   What would be your recommendations for the EU level in terms of minimum standards in  threat modelling and what recommendations for other EUMS?   What will the model look like in 5 years’ time?  National-level Risk Assessments  An Analysis Report  November 2013  Page  38  Annex C:  Questionnaire  Questionnaire: Introduction  National-level risk assessment and threat modelling of (critical) ICT infrastructures and services are  essential prerequisite processes in the context of developing and maintaining a national Network  and Information Security (NIS) cooperation/contingency plan, which in turn is one of the main pillars  of a National Cyber Security Strategy.46  As part of the Work Programme 2013, ENISA is undertaking research into national-level risk  assessment and threat modelling methodologies used for (critical) ICT infrastructures. The objective  in this study is to identify the valuable approaches, practices and challenges that countries have  experienced in the methods used for assessing risks of (critical) ICTs infrastructures, the  dependencies and challenges. The results of the analysis would help to identify the strengths of the  methods used so that all countries in Europe learn from the experiences and practices of others,  hoping to close the maturity gap.

    "abstract": "This report is based on a study and analysis of approaches to national-level risk assessment and threat modelling for cyber security which was conducted between April and October 2013. ENISA aims to provide an evidence-based methodology for establishing a National-level Risk Assessment in order to contribute to the wider objective of improving national contingency planning practices (NCPs) . This report will help towards rationalising national risk assessments in EU Member States in order to reduce or eliminate vulnerabilities of critical Information and Communication Technology (ICT) services and infrastructures. In conclusion we can see that understanding of the national approach to cyber security and how risk decisions are taken in different countries is important to ensure that the results of any National-level Risk Assessment reach key decision-makers at the right time. It is also clear that there are a variety of approaches and levels of sophistication used in National-level Risk Assessments. Qualitative tools appeared to be preferred due to the complexities of understanding risk in the cyber domain. Depending on the preconditions regarding implementation, risk assessment could be performed using a common set of methods or in a more decentralised fashion. Challenges included the diversity of methodologies and approaches to National-level Risk Assessments (which highlights the need for this guidance document) as well as the complexities of public–private cooperation. As might be expected, many countries studied drew lessons from others when preparing their National-level Risk Assessment programmes. Some countries had identified priorities that they were seeking to focus on, including greater understanding of threats, improved stakeholder engagement and better national CIIP frameworks. Based on an analysis of the data gathered we recommend the following: 1. Member States should understand better the underlying cyber threats and risks that they face and the impact to society. 2. Member States are advised to integrate National-level Risk Assessment into the lifecycle of NIS incident management and cooperation plans and procedures. 3. Member States should expand public–private sector dialogue and information sharing. 4. A practical step-by-step guide on how to perform National-level Risk Assessments should be developed, tested and maintained. Such a guide should be piloted by countries at the early stages of preparing their own National-level Risk Assessment programme. ENISA or another international institution would be appropriate bodies to oversee this action. 5. A catalogue of scenarios to help Member States in their National-level Risk Assessments should be established at EU level. Such a catalogue could be based on work already being done at ENISA on the threat landscape and incident reporting . 6. The EU community of practitioners with an interest in cyber National-level Risk Assessments should be established and strengthened as information exchange platform, e.g., within the framework of the European Commission’s NIS Platform . 7. Risk analysis expertise must be shared from other domains that assess complex cross-border risks, such as border security, financial services, aviation or public health for example within the European Commission’s NIS Platform and other activities organised by ENISA."

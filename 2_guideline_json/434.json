Cyber security is an essential enabling factor for the development and exploitation  of digital technologies and innovation and is, therefore, linked to future prospects for growth, job creation and  Europe’s response to environmental and societal goals. To facilitate the EU's ambition, Horizon 2020, the biggest  ever EU research and innovation programme is under way to foster R&D and innovation across Europe.  As part of the H2020 programme, the EC signed a contractual private-public partnership (cPPP) with the European  Cyber Security Organisation (ECSO), an industry-led contractual counterpart in July 2016. The aim of the  partnership is to bridge the gap between capacity building and the deployment of trusted European cybersecurity  solutions on European and international markets. The cPPP can be regarded as a key element of the master plan in  structuring and coordinating cyber security industrial resources in Europe. As part of the contractual obligations,  the ECSO drafted a Strategic Research and Innovation Agenda (SRIA) that identifies seven priority areas of R&D in  the field of cyber security, each of them broken down to headings that analyse the given priority in detail, making  suggestions for potential topics for calls for proposals in the framework of H2020. (Annex II outlines the priority  areas.)  From another aspect, Europe has also an opportunity to put policies in place to ensure that minimum security  requirements are put in place in digital products and services to ensure safety and security of the European  citizens and their data. There are two concurrent EU legislations, the General Data Protection Regulation2 (GDPR)  and the NIS Directive, 3that will have an ultimate impact on the next generation of goods and services in the cyber  domain in Europe and beyond. Both legislations are enablers of the Digital Single Market, and with this, Europe  should capitalise on the state-of-the-art cyber security to give Europe a competitive advantage.  The objective of this current document is to provide an analysis of the research proposals of the ECSO SRIA  document by briefly summarizing each research priority, and highlighting the areas where the priorities have to be  aligned with the provisions of the GDPR and the NIS Directive. The document endeavours to identify the most  research intensive vertical domains and transversal infrastructure, and match these with the most relevant areas  of cyber security research. The document also places the European cyber security environment in the global  context, and identifies the inhibiting factors of European leadership in the market.  1 https://europa.eu/european-union/file/1497/download_en?token=KzfSz- CR&usg=AOvVaw3RadlBjrZ19TcVzB4VsXOc  2 http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/reform/files/regulation_oj_en.pdf&usg=AOvVaw36C2K- 6DsRW98BUZ3iYgI5  3 http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32016L1148  Priorities for EU research  Analysis of the ECSO Strategic Research and Innovation Agenda (SRIA)  December 2017  06  1. Introduction and background to the ECSO SRIA  Objectives  The objective of the current report is to provide an analysis of the areas and priorities identified by the European  Cyber Security organization `Security research & innovation agenda` 4report. The document also looks into the  alignment of the priority areas with global cyber security trends and current EU legislation.  The background to the Security Research and Innovation Agenda report is the European Commission’s contractual  arrangement on a public-private partnership for cybersecurity industrial research and innovation between the  European Union and the stakeholder organisation represented by the European Cyber Security Organisation  (ECSO)5 association.  The following sections introduce the cybersecurity specific legislative environment of the EU that impact the future  research activities and the available funding schemes that foster R&D activities in the EU.  The EC approach to cyber security  The current approach to CIIP and resilience within the EU has its roots in the Commission communication of 2009,  entitled ‘Protecting Europe from large-scale cyber-attacks and disruptions: enhancing preparedness, security and  resilience6 . In 2013, the Commission released the Cybersecurity Strategy of the EU7 , which laid down a number of  fundamental principles underlying the EU approach to cybersecurity, including the need of achieving cyber  resilience, strong and effective legislation on the cyber domain, the promotion of a Single Market for cyber  security products, and fostering R&D investments and innovation.  The key challenges and priorities of the EU Cybersecurity Strategy are each addressed by separate but coherent  actions and legislations detailed below.  Digital Agenda  The Digital Agenda (2010-2020) proposes to better exploit the potential of info-communication technologies (ICTs)  in order to foster innovation, economic growth and progress.  The Digital Agenda's main objective is to develop a Digital Single Market  (DSM)8 in order to generate smart,  sustainable and inclusive growth in Europe, and it consists of the seven pillars below:   Achieving the digital single market   Enhancing interoperability and standards   Strengthening online trust and security   Promoting fast and reliable Internet access for all   Investing in research and innovation   Promoting digital literacy, skills and inclusion  4 http://www.ecs-org.eu/documents/publications/59e615c9dd8f1.pdf  5 http://ecso-org.eu/  6 Commission Communication of March 2009, “Protecting Europe from large-scale cyber-attacks and disruptions:  enhancing preparedness, security and resilience”, COM(2009)149.  7 Joint Communication on the Cybersecurity Strategy of the European Union: An Open, Safe and Secure Cyberspace,  available at: http://eeas.europa.eu/policies/eu-cyber-security/cybsec_comm_en.pdf  8 https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en  http://ecso-org.eu/  Priorities for EU research  Analysis of the ECSO Strategic Research and Innovation Agenda (SRIA)  December 2017  07   ICT-enabled benefits for EU society  The GDPR and the NIS Directive  This document takes two concurrent pieces of EU legislations into consideration, namely the General Data Protection  Regulation (GDPR) and the NIS Directive. Both pieces of legislation are enablers of the DMS, having an ultimate  impact on the next generation of goods, services, and content and cooperation models in the cyber domain in Europe  and beyond.  The NIS Directive is the first piece of EU legislation specifically aimed at improving cybersecurity  throughout the EU. By imposing a certain number of obligations for all Member States, the Directive will help ensure  a consistent approach to cybersecurity. This in itself represents a very significant step in the approach to securing  EU information systems and improving the functioning of the internal market.  The GDPR is designed to control the processing of personal data. Its rules are in the form of a Regulation, imposing  data protection standards that will be the same in all 28 EU Member States. Enforcement will be the responsibility  of each Member State, but the GDPR also encourages centralised co-ordination of enforcement across the EU. The  GDPR focuses on the protection and processing of personal data, and does not address the critical infrastructures.  The GDPR and the NIS Directive are complimentary initiatives with the shared goal of modernizing and  harmonizing system and data protection frameworks across the EU. The GDPR will give EU citizens stronger rights,  empowering them with better control of their data and ensuring that their privacy remains protected in the digital  age. The NIS Directive is complementary to the GDPR, aimed at the protection of IT systems in critical national  infrastructure for the EU. Table 1 provides a brief comparison of the two legislations:  GDPR NIS DIRECTIVE  Primary Goals  Regulation to achieve a general EU framework for  data protection  Directive on protecting personal data processed  for prevention, detection, investigation or  prosecution of criminal offenses and related  judicial activities  Improve cyber security capabilities in the Member  States  Improve Member States’ cooperation on cyber  security  Directive concerning measures to ensure a  standard high level of network and information  security across the EU  Organizations  Impacted  Data controllers and data processors  Essentially any organization with ‘Personal Data’  Operators of essential services in the energy,  transport, banking and healthcare sectors  Providers of critical digital services like search  engines and cloud computing  Enforcement  Data breaches must be reported as soon as  possible and, where feasible, no later than 72  hours after discovery of a breach.  Regulation will apply to companies  headquartered outside of Europe as long as they  have operations in Europe. Data Transfers to third  countries and international organizations may  only be carried out in full compliance with this  Regulation Requires Data Protection Officer  Requires operators of essential services in the  energy, transport, banking and healthcare sectors,  and providers of critical digital services like search  engines and cloud computing, to take appropriate  security measures and report incidents to the  national authorities  Member States will be required to designate a  national competent authority for the  implementation and enforcement of the  Directive, as well as CSIRTs responsible for  handling incidents and risks  https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-data-protection/key-definitions/ http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-15-6270_en.htm  Priorities for EU research  Analysis of the ECSO Strategic Research and Innovation Agenda (SRIA)  December 2017  08  Penalties  Maximum penalties for data breaches are now 4%  of global revenue or 20M Euro, whichever is  higher  Penalties and fines yet to be clearly defined  Effective Date May 25, 2018  The NIS Directive was published in the Official  Journal of the European Union on July 19, 2016.  Member States have until May 9, 2018 to  implement this Directive into national laws and a  further six months to identify “operators of  essential services.”  Table 1 A brief comparison of the GDPR and the NIS Directive  eIDAS9  Electronic identification (eID) and electronic Trust Services (eTS) are key enablers for secure cross-border  electronic transactions and central building blocks of the Digital Single Market. The eIDAS Regulation ensures that  people and businesses can use their own national electronic identification schemes (eIDs) to access public services  in other EU countries where eIDs are available. It also creates a European internal market for eTS - namely  electronic signatures, electronic seals, time stamp, electronic delivery service and website authentication - by  ensuring that they will work across borders and have the same legal status as traditional paper based processes.  With eIDAS, the EU has managed to lay down the right foundations and a predictable legal framework for people,  companies (in particular SMEs) and public administrations to safely access services and do transactions online and  across border in just \"one click\".  In terms of relevance to this document, the eIDAS Regulation bears several  overlapping provisions with the GDPR and the NIS Directive in setting a secure environment for eID and eTS.  Privacy-by-design and data breach notification are appearing in the GDPR, while security requirements of trust  service providers, compliment the aims of the NIS Directive in building resilient infrastructures and services. The  intent of eIDAS is to drive innovation. By adhering to the guidelines set for technology under eIDAS, organizations  are pushed towards using higher levels of information security and innovation.10  9 Regulation (EU) 910/2014 on electronic identification and trust services for electronic transactions in the internal  market, adopted on 23 July 2014, http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal- content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32014R0910&from=EN  10 more details on the topic: https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/trust-services?tab=publications  http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32014R0910&from=EN http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32014R0910&from=EN https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/trust-services?tab=publications  Priorities for EU research  Analysis of the ECSO Strategic Research and Innovation Agenda (SRIA)  December 2017  09  R&D activities and funding schemes  As a key priority to foster R&D and innovation across Europe, a structure of research facilities and funding schemes  is in place to provide expertise and management to research and innovation projects and to promote synergies  between these activities, to benefit economic growth and EU citizens. The beneficiaries of the funding programmes  include SMEs, research centres, universities, large companies, the types of funds range from supporting start-ups to  various clusters.  The Connecting Europe Facility (CEF) is a key EU funding instrument to promote growth, jobs and competitiveness  through targeted infrastructure investment at European level. It supports the development of high performing,  sustainable and efficiently interconnected trans-European networks in the fields of transport, energy and digital  services. CEF investments aim to fill the missing links in Europe's main infrastructural backbone. The Innovation and  Networks Executive Agency (INEA) is responsible for the technical and financial management of the programme.  Horizon 2020 is the biggest running EU research and innovation programme. Almost €79 billion of funding is  available over seven years (2014 to 2020). H2020 will help to achieve smart, sustainable and inclusive economic  growth. The goal is to ensure that Europe produces world-class science and technology, removes barriers to  innovation and makes it easier for the public and private sectors to work together in delivering solutions to big  challenges facing our society. In the course of implementing the programme, H2020 will build on the experience of  public private partnerships. The programme objectives are coordinated by various European bodies and agencies.  Funding schemes by EC General Directorates: The European Commission makes direct financial contributions in the  form of grants to projects or organisations which help implement EU programmes or policies. Amongst others, DG  CONNECT11, DG JUSTICE12, DG Migration and Home Affairs13 run various funding programmes in the field of cyber  security.  The European Cyber Security Organization (ECSO)14  The European Cyber Security Organisation (ECSO) ASBL is a not-for-profit organisation under Belgian law, established  in June 2016. ECSO represents an industry-led contractual counterpart to the European Commission for the  implementation of the cyber security contractual Public-Private Partnership (cPPP). ECSO members include a wide  variety of stakeholders such as large companies, SMEs and Start-ups, research centres, universities, end-users,  operators, clusters and associations as well as European Member State’s local, regional and national administrations,  countries part of the European Economic Area (EEA) and the European Free Trade Association (EFTA) and H2020  associated countries. The main objective of ECSO is to support all types of initiatives or projects that aim to develop,  promote, encourage European cybersecurity, and in particular to:  - Foster and protect the growth of the European Digital Single Market from cyber threats;  - Develop the cybersecurity market in Europe and the growth of a competitive cybersecurity and ICT industry,  with an increased market position;  11 Digital Single Market-related topics and projects, https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/funding  12 Rights, Equality and Citizenship Programme 2014-2020, http://ec.europa.eu/justice/grants1/programmes-2014- 2020/rec/index_en.htm  13 Security programmes, https://ec.europa.eu/home-affairs/financing/fundings_en  14 http://ecs-org.eu/about  https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/funding http://ec.europa.eu/justice/grants1/programmes-2014-2020/rec/index_en.htm http://ec.europa.eu/justice/grants1/programmes-2014-2020/rec/index_en.htm https://ec.europa.eu/home-affairs/financing/fundings_en http://ecs-org.eu/about  Priorities for EU research  Analysis of the ECSO Strategic Research and Innovation Agenda (SRIA)  December 2017  10  - Develop and implement cybersecurity solutions for the critical steps of trusted supply chains, in sectoral  applications where Europe is a leader15.  As part of the EU cybersecurity strategy, the European Commission and the ECSO signed a contractual private-public  partnership (cPPP)16 on 5 July 2016. The aim of the partnership is to foster cooperation between public and private  actors at early stages of the research and innovation process in order to allow people in Europe to access innovative  and trustworthy European ICT products and services. The cPPP can be regarded as a master plan in structuring and  coordinating digital security industrial resources in Europe. It includes a wide range of actors, from innovative SMEs  to producers of components and equipment, critical infrastructure operators and research institutes, brought  together under the umbrella of ECSO.  1.7.1 Security research and innovation agenda (Working group 6)  Within ECSO there are 6 working groups dealing with different topics:   WG1: Standardisation, certification, labelling and supply chain management   WG2: Market deployment, investments and international collaboration   WG3: Sectoral demand   WG4: Support to SMEs , coordination with countries (in particular East and Central EU) and regions   WG5: Education, awareness, training, exercises   WG6: Strategic Research and Innovation Agenda (SRIA)  Relevant to this paper is the working group 6, Strategic Research and Innovation Agenda (SRIA). The objectives of  this group are:   Coordination of results and expectations from European Commission and R&I projects   Coordination of cybersecurity activities across cPPPs and EU Initiatives   Support cPPP implementation and H2020 cybersecurity projects   Detailed suggestions for the Work Programme 2017-2020 using an updated and focused SRIA  ECSO – Security research and innovation agenda (SRIA WG 6)  1.8.1 Structure of the SRIA working group 6 publication17  There are seven priority areas identified in the Security Research and Innovation agenda, each of them broken down  to headings that analyse the given priority in detail. The technical projects are ment to deliver basic capabilities  (building blocks), on top of which both large cyber infrastructures (cross domains) and domain specific pilots can be  leveraged. The general structure of each heading includes a discussion of the specific challenge and a description of  the current status, including previous and ongoing projects in the fields. The market specifics and their European  relevance are also detailed, and the scope of research & innovation is suggested at each heading, followed by the  anticipated targeted users and the expected impact. A budget line is referred to each of the headings at the end of  each section, to be funded from the H2020 framework. Along the discussion of each heading, especially at the  challenge, status, and market descriptions, the current environment with special attention to market trends is  15 such as defence, automotive, and process industries, mechanical engineering, utilities (including utility equipment  vendors), telecom, and financial services  16 A cPPP is not specific for the cyber security industry. Any industry can set up a stakeholder interest group. The cPPP  is set up in the framework of the Horizon 2020 and is open to all organisations from the European Union and the  partnership countries. All eligible organisation can be beneficiaries of grant agreements for projects within the cPPP  irrespective of their affiliation.  17 http://www.ecs-org.eu/documents/publications/59e615c9dd8f1.pdf  Priorities for EU research  Analysis of the ECSO Strategic Research and Innovation Agenda (SRIA)  December 2017  11  detailed. References to the GDPR are common, as data protection and privacy regulations have an impact on most  priority headings. Relevance to the NIS Directive can also be found throughout the document, as the various priority  areas need to be operational in the regulatory and cooperation environment set by the directive.  1.8.2 Alignment of the ECSO SRIA priority areas with the GDPR and the NIS Directive  In terms of aligning the research objectives of the ECSO SRIA document with the GDPR, the primary remark regarding  the legislation is that it addresses the overall protection of European citizens and is therefore not sector-specific by  nature. The regulation does not reference cyber security, critical infrastructures, or any of the vertical sectors  defined in the SRIA document, however, provisions of the regulation must be applied in relation to the products and  services implemented as the result of the R&D activities. The GDPR employs a risk-based approach to data  protection. Organisations are encouraged to implement organisational and technical measures suitable for the  activities they engage in, following a risk assessment.  As for the NIS Directive, it specifies measures with a view to achieving a high common level of security of networks  and information systems within the EU so as to improve the functioning of the internal real and digital market. It  sets the baseline capabilities for each Member State to make sure they are well equipped to face cyber threats. In  addition, it aims at increasing EU-wide cooperation, both at strategic (Cooperation Group of national authorities)  and operational (CSIRT network) level and sets the requirements for notification of incidents. These provisions of  the directive mostly apply for the cyber transversal infrastructures, defined later in this document.  The following sections detail the areas of research work proposed by the SRIA document. The main sections are the  cyber Eco-system projects; the pilot projects for vertical application sectors, the cyber transversal infrastructures,  and the cyber technical projects. All these projects describe the priorities identified. Each priority includes  subsections of the key areas of research. (Annex II outlines the seven Strategic Research and Innovation Agenda  priorities.)  1.8.3 Ecosystem for Education, training, market growth and SME support  The Ecosystem for education, training, market growth and SME support requires an organised approach of  collaboration. Creating an operational (technological and human) eco-system is key to address the many issues that  contribute to an overall increase in the level of cyber-security. To address the challenge, the approach is to create a  continuum in terms of constituency – from users to solution providers and in terms of mechanisms – from need to  innovation and market.  Cyber Range and simulation are techniques that implement a wide number of complex scenarios and on-demand  countermeasures to address emerging cyber-risks. The cyber-range and simulation concepts are of relevance to all  stakeholders, regular users, professionals and experts to be able to adapt their expertise to a constantly evolving  attack landscape, a widening range of IT-impacted services, and changing regulations. The current challenge is to  extend the capabilities of cyber-ranges to user domain specificities, such as SCADA, ICS, mobile devices, health  related devices and IoT devices etc., to the integration or federation of solutions for different simulation  environments, to the development of tools to automate the preparation for large-scale simulation scenarios.  The existing simulation infrastructures are often government funded and operated, as well as defence focused, while  start-ups, universities, SMEs and large companies, critical infrastructure providers also need to have access to such  capabilities to reach the objective of higher competitiveness of European cybersecurity industry as well as a more  secure digital society in Europe. The EU provides an ideal opportunity for creating a world leading ecosystem for  simulation and cyber range platforms, given the common rules for digital society, data protection and business  environment, as well as a currently distributed cyber-security experience and actionable knowledge base. The scope  of the projects should focus on the piloting of networked cyber-ranges and the extension of the cyber-ranges  network. The impact will improve resilience of the ICT infrastructure, organise collaboration between a network of  cyber-ranges and Europe-wide initiatives such as the CSIRT network of the NIS Directive.  Priorities for EU research  Analysis of the ECSO Strategic Research and Innovation Agenda (SRIA)  December 2017  12  Security education and training needs to supply cybersecurity professionals and needs to provide a constant  learning process in a complex and fast-evolving field. There is a lack of suitable training and testing environments  available for the commercial sector to satisfy the needs for cybersecurity training and product testing. For example,  there are very few open ranges to involve more participants to the exercises, trainings, testing, experimenting, and  the existing ones focus on their specific needs.  The scope of the projects should focus on increasing the dynamics of the education and awareness methods, to  match the rate of evolution of cybercrime; and integrating awareness into the eco-system of people, competences,  services and solutions, that is able to rapidly adapt to the evolutions of cybercrime or even surpass them. The impact  will create better prepared professionals to emergent cyber-attacks, improve the resilience of infrastructures to  attacks, help to understand and to limit cybercriminal relationships.  Certification and standardisation of security products and services needs a unified position of Member States in  order to move towards the digital single market. There is no label, seal or certification scheme that is standard for  European security services and products. It is essential to promote the development of basic knowledge on  information security for users to raise awareness related to the risks posed by the use of products of unknown origin.  The challenge is to define a unified criterion for certification of cybersecurity products and services. This is a strong  demand to be reflected with the increase of the market size of IoT, intelligent cars and the overall role of IT across  all domains of our lives.18  The scope of the projects should focus on the development of mechanisms that ease the process of certification at  the level of services, designing solutions by defining and exercising metrics that should be related to a set of threat  models, and addressing the evolution of the level of certification with respect to the dynamicity of the deployed  environment.  Dedicated support to SMEs is designed towards SMEs as users and as solution providers. User SMEs need to be  supported in democratizing access to tools & solutions of varied sophistication level for SMEs to enable them also  to benefit from innovations and solutions that are currently reserved for larger organisations. As creators of  innovative solutions, provider SMEs need to be supported to access information and resources to better align their  innovation to needs and ease their validation. The support should include easing the piloting and field-testing to  foster a collaboration between SMEs, large providers and users and ease the delivery of joint competence. The  specific challenge therefore addresses the full value-chain for both provider and user SMEs. The scope of the Fast  Track and Full Access to Innovation projects should focus on the involvement of provider SMEs into cyber-ranges as  solution providers and ease their access to user environments, as well as increasing the level of cyber resilience of  user SMEs.  Another area of support for SMEs is to create a cybersecurity certification scheme for them, promoting a system of  “light” requirements for software/hardware/solution/system, enabling them to adapt their certification to the  actual environment/user context in which their solutions are deployed.  1.8.4 Demonstrations for the society, economy, industry and vital services:  Demonstrations for the society, economy, industry and vital services a description of the vertical sectors (application  domains) and their specific needs concerning cyber security.  Industry 4.0 is the current trend of automation and data exchange in manufacturing technologies. It includes cyber- physical systems (mainly ICS), the Internet of things and cloud computing, touching on the issues of digital  intelligence, smart sensing, advanced system modelling and machine learning technology, enabling enhanced  autonomy & efficiency of robotics. Projects addressing this topic should propose, design, validate and demonstrate  technological and organizational solutions enabling enhanced digitalization & modernization of existing and new  18 more details on the topic: https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/standards?tab=publications  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/standards?tab=publications  Priorities for EU research  Analysis of the ECSO Strategic Research and Innovation Agenda (SRIA)  December 2017  13  industries in Europe in a secure way. The challenges of the current approach to the security of ICS pose a number of  considerations relevant to GDPR and the NIS Directive. Innovation in the sector means a higher level of exposure,  adding new attack surfaces to the ICS environments19.  Privacy and confidentiality become a security issue with the requirements of the GDPR, while smart objects handle  a range of sensitive user data, service providers use Big Data solutions. The scope of R&D in the field should focus  on the secure and privacy-considerate transition of the manufacturing industry, and securing advanced  manufacturing labs. Information sharing mechanisms will support the implementation of the NIS Directive by  building horizontal, vertical and cross sector information exchanges, where the national CSIRTs and relevant  authorities play a coordinating role.  Energy: it is crucial for energy operators to ensure the safety and security of the whole interconnected energy chain,  from generation to supply as society relies completely on energy. Interconnected smart devices, such as sensors and  actuators, are widely deployed in households to measure energy use and reduce energy equipment consumption  and it is predicted that the number of these smart devices, known collectively as the Internet of Things, will amount  to several billion in the coming years. At the same time, energy infrastructures are increasingly exposed to cyber  threats due to the massive use of ICT and of new data interfaces and smart devices which offer new points of entry  to attackers20.  The energy systems could be structured around three main domains.  Smart Grids are the digitalization of electricity infrastructure and the transition from a closed, centralized, analogue  infrastructure to an open, largely decentralized, digital infrastructure, based on a highly interconnected ICT  infrastructure, allowing monitoring of the different components of the electric system. While smart grids take  substantial advantage of this new ICT infrastructure, they become at the same time more vulnerable as they are  now exposed to communication networks and computer application cyber-attacks which could cause serious  damage to the electricity network, as well as impacting the integrity and confidentiality of customers’ data.  Distributed Energy Resources (DER) are small-scale power generation sources located close to where electricity is  used (e.g., a home or business). They provide an alternative to or an enhancement of the traditional electric power  grid. The DER represent an important part of the whole electricity generation due to their massive integration in the  grid. Attacks targeting a large number of renewable energy sources (e.g. windfarms) could have a severe impact on  the smart grid and thus on electricity supply.  Centralized electricity generation plants with a significantly long lifespan, are now introducing the use of new ICT  technologies. Legacy systems have constrained resources and sometimes rely on old software that cannot always  be changed. As safety is a major requirement of these infrastructures, security solutions have to mitigate security  threats which can have an impact on safety, while potential interdependencies between security systems and safety  systems need to be managed. Due to the use of new technologies such as IoT, privacy issues have to be addressed  and solutions proposed.  The scope of research in the field should address control and management of cascading effects in power grids to  avoid major supply disruptions, control and management of increased cyber threats over time in the context of the  digitalization path of the energy system, and advanced access control schemes (logical and physical) for strategic  energy facilities.  The GDPR impacts the energy sector by providing guidelines for dealing with privacy and data  protection issues when using smart devices and IoT. Privacy-by-design should use appropriate technical safeguards  e.g. encryption and pseudononymisation that provide the expected level of data protection of the customers.  19 more details on the topic: https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/critical-information-infrastructures-and- services/scada?tab=publications  20 more details on the topic: https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/critical-information-infrastructures-and- services/smart-grids?tab=publications  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/critical-information-infrastructures-and-services/scada?tab=publications https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/critical-information-infrastructures-and-services/scada?tab=publications https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/critical-information-infrastructures-and-services/smart-grids?tab=publications https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/critical-information-infrastructures-and-services/smart-grids?tab=publications  Priorities for EU research  Analysis of the ECSO Strategic Research and Innovation Agenda (SRIA)  December 2017  14  According to the NIS Directive, Member States are requested to identify the operators of essential services and the  energy providers fall under this provision. As such, the specific energy subsector need to address the common threat  and risk landscape and be able to react to unexpected events. The NIS Directive addresses this issue by implementing  national CSIRTs and establishing reporting and information exchange capabilities between CSIRTs and the essential  service providers. Establishment of CSIRTs specializing in the energy domain (i.e. ICS-CSIRTs) are beyond the scope  of the cPPP, and must be handled at the Member State level. Specific actions for the energy operators are to  implement crisis management frameworks, supply chain integrity frameworks, awareness raising frameworks and  information sharing mechanisms that are independent of the research areas and must be applied to the energy  sector in general.  Smart Buildings & Smart Cities reflect an urban development vision to integrate ICT and IoT technologies in a secure  way to manage a city's interconnected assets, such as the information systems of local departments, schools,  libraries, transportation systems, hospitals, power plants, water supply networks, waste management, law  enforcement, and other community services. Like any other ICT system, the smart city’s technological and  communication environment is vulnerable to cyber-attacks and a large amount of data is at stake. The main aim of  smart cities technologies is to make cities data-driven; allowing city systems and services to be responsive and act  upon data in real-time. Innovation and research should focus on the simulation and detection of the additional  security threats created through the inter-connection of smart systems, the delivery of a cyber-security framework  to ease the collaboration across all smart cities stakeholders, from urban planners to infrastructure operators, IT  supervisors and providers across organisations, and implementing a common approach to securing and managing  the data from all the systems of a smart city / smart building – supporting both the citizen and the public authorities  in creating transparent, efficient and accountable cyber-secure data handling processes.21  As smart cities & buildings are data driven, organizational implications of the GDPR will be a major challenge with all  the obligations imposed on data processors and controllers. A network of data protection officers will have to be  trained, data security programs and processes, including privacy notices and information disclosure statements have  to be documented. On the technical side, the city's critical assets need to be segmented, a common approach of  privacy-by-design should be adopted to limit insecure products and data leakage.  In terms of alignment with the NIS Directive, smart cities need to focus on governance. A strategy with oversight and  organization over a city's cyber preparedness, especially in terms of cross-function vulnerability assessment and  incident response planning should work out mechanisms for information sharing, both horizontal and vertical.  Certification mechanisms will ensure interconnected devices meet standardized requirements, thus building more  resilient networks and information systems.  Transportation covers all security aspects of transport systems (people and freight) whose compromise, as a result  of coordinated attacks, may have serious impact at national and/or European level (e.g. cyber-physical attack  accompanied by a large-scale terrorist attack). Transportation covers four areas: unmanned aerial vehicles, smart  cars and trucks and road-side infrastructure, maritime units and their infrastructure, and the railway system, all of  which exhibit specific challenges to security research. In terms of economic power, European Automotive industry  is currently leading innovation worldwide, European railway companies currently lead the world market, European  shipbuilding is the world leader in building complex ships.  - Vehicles are becoming another consumer smart device. This will require the ability to update the  cryptographic algorithms and, in general, any part of its software, to adapt to upcoming challenges (e.g.  revocation of cryptographic material and certificates, revising protocols and blacklisting, upgrading and  patching of software, etc.). Other challenges are related with Identity Management (identification of entities  and up-to-date certificates), misbehaviour detection (tampering on-board sensors) and privacy protection.  21 more details on the topic: https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/iot-and-smart-infrastructures/smart- cities?tab=publications  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/iot-and-smart-infrastructures/smart-cities?tab=publications https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/iot-and-smart-infrastructures/smart-cities?tab=publications  Priorities for EU research  Analysis of the ECSO Strategic Research and Innovation Agenda (SRIA)  December 2017  15  Pedestrians, vehicles and the infrastructure need to be able to trust each other. Cybersecurity attacks  targeting smart cars may have severe consequences through life-threatening accidents but also through  smart-car based or assisted terrorist attacks. Besides the societal impact, smart-car based cyberattacks pose  a severe economic threat since trucks cover 75% of the European domestic good transport.22  - Maritime Vessels (cargo or cruise ships) and their infrastructure at land (ports) are at the heart of the global  economy: 90% of the international trade of goods are transported overseas, within Europe approximately  60% of goods are carried by maritime transport. The maritime domain, including ports, faces cybersecurity  challenges that are similar to those affecting ICS based industries The increasing connectivity of smart port  systems, cargo tracking and cargo identification are increasingly subject to cyber security incidents resulting  from cyber-attacks.  - An unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) -  or drone - is an aircraft without a human pilot. UAVs may carry out  surveillance and response missions for border security, homeland security, and critical infrastructure  protection, but on the other hand may call for attention to accidental, malicious, or criminal misuses.  Interest in cyber-weapons embedded in defensive UAVs is growing, but there are a number of technical and  operational challenges to face. Projects addressing this topic should propose innovative security frameworks  to support the design of robust cost-effective Sentry UAVs, tailored to surveillance missions towards Rogue  UAVs.  Railway is considered as a safety critical application. The railway infrastructure is highly distributed per Member  State, the networks don't fulfil the usual cyber security requirements in terms of sustainability, protection and attack  detection. Some encryption protocols have already been standardized but their application is restricted to particular  ETCS interfaces. The lack of standardisation is a major impediment for the development of a cyber-secure signalling  system. Applied to the railways system, the main objective of the security system is to ensure high availability,  authentication and integrity of the railways system by preventing attacks or errors. In terms of aligning research  areas with the GDPR, special technical controls need to be developed in the transportation sector to meet the data  protection requirements and at the same time create state-of-the-art products. The focus of innovation and  investment should put more strength in lightweight cryptography for reliable and timely authentication of vehicles,  multimodal authentication schemes to identify and authenticate driver and other humans, tamperproof  communication protocols to avoid channel hijacking, privacy preserving authentication.  Transportation is regarded as a critical sector in many of the Member States. As such, there is special attention on  the sector constituents by the competent authorities as well as national or sectoral CSIRTs. If constituents of the  transportation industry will be designated as operators of essential service, mandatory information exchanges will  be applied to the essential service providers.  Standardization of various technology elements (e.g. communication,  data protection) in the course of the innovation activities also enhance the resilience of the transportation industry,  adding to the safety and security of the European citizens. Governance aspects of the NIS Directive will be fulfilled  by laying emphasis on business continuity of the transportation services.  Healthcare faces many security challenges, most of them common to any critical infrastructure. Major concerns in  the field of e-health are associated with the high privacy and confidentiality requirements of sensitive healthcare  data23. Cyber-attacks targeting the Health sector are on the rise. Lack of adequate IT spending by healthcare  organizations and lack of awareness about cybercrime have exposed the vulnerabilities of healthcare organizations.  The designated Operators of Essential Services under the healthcare sector within European Union fall under the  stringent rules of the NIS Directive, being considered one of the critical infrastructures in many of the Member  States. Pilot projects in the field should focus on existing e-Health services involving as many stakeholders as  22 more details on the topic: https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/iot-and-smart-infrastructures/smart- cars?tab=publications  23 more details on the topic: https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/critical-information-infrastructures-and- services/health?tab=publications  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/iot-and-smart-infrastructures/smart-cars?tab=publications https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/iot-and-smart-infrastructures/smart-cars?tab=publications https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/critical-information-infrastructures-and-services/health?tab=publications https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/critical-information-infrastructures-and-services/health?tab=publications  Priorities for EU research  Analysis of the ECSO Strategic Research and Innovation Agenda (SRIA)  December 2017  16  possible, including but not limited to patients, healthcare service providers, doctors and other professionals. The  integrity of healthcare data being distributed among these many actors should be one of the key research areas. The  e-Health service should involve interconnected systems and data transfer, mobile services, smart devices and data  analytics, digitalisation of all the healthcare levels, the development of Assisted Living systems, wearable devices,  IP-enabled medical devices.  Specific challenges include eHealth service resiliency against cyberattacks (especially in new technologies like  telemedicine, home care systems, remote monitoring, mHealth), prevention against data-leakage and loss of patient  data and identity theft. Systems availability and business continuity is another key component of eHealth. Privacy- by-design should be another focus area to ensure data security and integrity, especially in terms of big data  originating from clinical trials and healthcare digitalization. These challenges all align with the requirements set out  in the GDPR and the NIS Directive.  E-services for the public sector can provide a number of benefits to both citizens and businesses, including improved  data transparency and service availability, increased participation of citizenship in political affairs (e.g., e-voting),  more convenient contact with administrations and access to Public Services, reduced administrative burden and  operating costs to Governments. This is in line with EU’s open data policy, which is part of the Digital Agenda for  Europe, and that sees open data as a driver for innovation, growth and transparent governance. Specific needs to  achieve this status include privacy enhancing data handling tools and technologies that ensure confidentiality,  integrity and availability.  Governments are the largest data controllers and processors, so ensuring confidentiality, integrity and availability is  the primary challenge. Failing to do so can lead to political unrest and the lack of inclusion of citizens in the digital  society. The provisions of the GDPR and NIS Directive place a special responsibility on the Member States to deploy  seamless technical controls to protect the data of its citizens and businesses, as well as taking part in national and  international cooperation via the national CSIRTs and the competent authorities to enhance the resiliency of the  governmental infrastructures.  The financial sector is considered to be the backbone of the economic development and competitiveness of Europe.  The implementation of a Single Financial Market and the aim of strengthening Europe's cyber resilience will highlight  some of the risks and challenges in order to reach a Single European Digital Financial Market. The increasing number  and frequency of sophisticated cyber-attacks against the banking sector highlights the need to develop a cyber  security framework to protect the integrated financial market and to combat cyber fraud. This requires a  comprehensive approach against emerging risks that takes into account the rise of digital banking via new devices,  the developments of innovative solutions based upon a collaborative integration such as DLT and blockchain24 and  concerns over privacy and data protection issues.  To reach an appropriate and consistent level of risk mitigation, it is important to foster awareness through data and  information sharing, even to the extent of sharing common infrastructures and to implement awareness raising and  training programs to overcome the negligence of the human factor. The investment into cyber solutions in the  financial sector represents a huge opportunity to boost European economy, by overcoming the customer fear and  enhancing their trust in digital means. The financial sector is mentioned in both GDPR and the NIS Directive. Failure  to protect customer data can lead to unforeseen effects. Data protection by means of technical innovations should  focus on new methods of authentication and authorization, whereas the infrastructure protection should focus on  building resilience through information sharing and cyber crisis simulation. The financial sector is a critical  infrastructure and CSIRTs are already engaged with the traditional financial institutions, however, with the opening  24 more details on the topic: https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/critical-information-infrastructures-and- services/finance?tab=publications  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/critical-information-infrastructures-and-services/finance?tab=publications https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/critical-information-infrastructures-and-services/finance?tab=publications  Priorities for EU research  Analysis of the ECSO Strategic Research and Innovation Agenda (SRIA)  December 2017  17  of the financial market under the PSD2 Directive, the newcomer service providers also need to be involved in the  governance strategy of the financial sector.  Telco, media and content providers are closely related market sectors with great financial importance, mostly listed  among the critical sectors in Member States. Telco networks are a core component of the current and future digital  infrastructure, so ensuring their security and dependability is vital to the European and global economy. Europe has  a good reputation in both privacy protection and in reliable high-quality system management, which justifies for  hosting data and systems in Europe despite of relatively high labour costs. Telcos, ISPs and large hosting companies  are amongst the more sophisticated types of companies investing into cybersecurity as they are high profile, high  value targets for cyber attackers and the consequences of disrupting operations are highly visible and have  widespread impact. For this reason, the scope of innovation and investments are focused around the areas of mobile  and IoT security, detection of threats and illegal content, cloud services and platforms, network virtualisation,  encryption, and 5G networking technologies. Telco, media and content providers are likely to become operators of  essential services based on the NIS Directive, so their reporting obligations in terms of data breach and security  incidents will impact their daily business. With regard to the GDPR, these operators will have to lay special emphasis  on their activity as data processors and controllers, especially with the enhanced notice and information obligations  before collection and to adhere with the consent and ability to withdraw information.  1.8.5 Collaborative intelligence to manage cyber threats and risks  Cyber Transversal Infrastructure is a complex entity composed of elements utilising diverse technologies and owned  by different entities, including network operators, cloud service providers, national and local government agencies,  end user companies and private individuals. As the vertical elements depend critically on the digital infrastructure,  it must be highly resilient and trustworthy. The challenge is to secure that the infrastructures serving the applications  are resilient to attack, accident and error, and assure them of the trustworthiness of the infrastructure. There are  two complementary approaches to making a system more secure: the first is to harden the functional elements of  the system in order to make them more resistant to attack and/or failure; the second is to incorporate additional  security-specific components and processes into the system, which include protection, detection, response &  recovery and Governance, Risk and Compliance (GRC). These components apply to individual elements of the digital  infrastructure as a whole, and to the applications and organisations that depend on the infrastructure, incorporating  aspects of cooperation and coordination, both laterally and vertically.  Governance, Risk & Compliance: Security Assessment and Risk Management uses an integrated approach involving  people, processes and technology; the interrelationships between physical and logical security; and between safety  and cybersecurity. When managing risk in critical infrastructures or in cyber-physical systems, security, safety,  resilience and reliability properties and requirements should be concurrently viewed, consolidated and reconciled  in an integrated manner. At the same time, security risk management must be aligned and interlinked with  enterprise risk management and cost factors. Risk should be managed with respect to the assets, services and data  to be protected, and investment in security should be aligned with their value and the impact of their potential  malfunctions.  Risk management is a major catalyst for cyber security. The GDPR and NIS Directive will be driving forces for risk  management in Europe in the upcoming years, both are seen as important tools to drive adequate protection of  data. GRC is a tool that provides an integrated security view (logical, physical, safety, resilience, juridical,  organisational) holistically taking into account people, processes and technology in its analysis of potential threats  and vulnerabilities, their impact and potential countermeasures in order to enable strategic oversight of the  effectiveness of an organisation’s security processes. It synthesises a strategic picture using input from  tactical/operation security systems and process, and provides an organisation’s senior management with means of  assessing and improving its security posture. The output of the GRC should facilitate inter-organisational cooperation  and cooperation with supra-organisational institutions. This includes trusted information sharing mechanisms on  threats, vulnerabilities and incidents, perhaps on an industry basis, to help the creation and coordination of  Priorities for EU research  Analysis of the ECSO Strategic Research and Innovation Agenda (SRIA)  December 2017  18  preventive and corrective plans. Information sharing is mandated for operators of essential services by the NIS  Directive. Data based risk management approaches need to be part of the GRC solution, to achieve better  preparedness through the analysis of data fed from multiple domains (infrastructure, process, operations, and  observation) and multiple sources or even sectors to provide additional intelligence.25  Innovations in the area should address risk-based situation awareness, assessment and decision support, automated  assessment mechanisms, cyber risk governance, the use of cyber ranges, simulation & training, and the certification  of operators.  PROTECT: High-assurance prevention and protection against attacks in modern ICT components, infrastructure, and  systems remains a complex task, so there is justifiable need for the design, implementation, and verification of high- assurance components, systems, and infrastructures. Solutions for end-users also require high-assurance security as  they are considered a key security vulnerability. To achieve high-assurance, investments on cybersecurity initiatives  to protect PCs, mobile devices, and IoT devices will need to be increased. The scope of innovation and research  should cover means to protect digital infrastructures and the applications that use them by preventing cyber-attacks  on them being successful. Security, privacy and trust considerations should be involved from the very beginning in  the design of digital infrastructure, systems and processes. Trustworthiness should also cover secure execution  environments and systems.  By preparing the infrastructures to better resist advanced attacks and their consequences, protection capabilities  will target the users of ICT and ICS infrastructure. This will result in the increase of trustworthiness of European ICT  services and products and the competitiveness of the European industry.  DETECT: Information Sharing, Security Analytics, and Cyber-Threat Detection are advanced processes that enable  an organization to gather valuable insights based on the analysis of contextual and situational risks and can be  tailored to the specific threat landscape, its industry and markets. Intelligence driven detection can improve the  ability to anticipate breaches before they occur and respond quickly, decisively and effectively to confirmed  breaches. SIEMs and SOCs are currently struggling with the challenge of integrating multiple sources of data,  including a multitude of ICT and ICS systems on one side and diverse threat information data on the other side. So  they need more intelligent and effective approaches for integrating and using the mass of data available. It is  essential to establish how information should be shared and which level of abstraction is effective. The analysis  should be done across different information sources both unstructured (textual content and multimedia) and  structured ones, and for this natural language analysis must be taken into account. Machine learning technologies  could be helpful in obtaining Cyber Security Intelligence from the Dark/Deep Web. The sharing of security  information requires trust mechanisms among the entities involved in sharing their data. A common, normalised  terminology and framework is important in facilitating sharing of information and reducing response and processing  times.26  Proposals on this subtopic need to target the improvement of detection and analysis of cyber-threats at a system,  network meta-system and process level, based on a combination of existing and new techniques. Specific  developments may target challenging environments like ICS/SCADA, mobility & cloud, IoT, virtualized networks or  embedded systems. The complementarity between end-point and network detection capabilities should be  enhanced, and scalability to big data should also be enabled. A native European threat intelligence feed should be  established, and a mechanism created for distributing this information effectively among the stakeholders,  especially operators of critical infrastructures as defined by the NIS Directive.  RESPONSE and RECOVERY: Cyber threat management is concerned with planning and executing appropriate actions  following the detection of a security event, and restoring the system to ‘business as usual’ status. Digital Forensics  25 more details on the topic: https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/threat-risk-management?tab=publications  26 more details on the topic: https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/national-cyber-security-strategies/information- sharing?tab=publications  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/threat-risk-management?tab=publications https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/national-cyber-security-strategies/information-sharing?tab=publications https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/national-cyber-security-strategies/information-sharing?tab=publications  Priorities for EU research  Analysis of the ECSO Strategic Research and Innovation Agenda (SRIA)  December 2017  19  and Attack Attribution are important associated activities that play key roles in improving security technologies,  controls, and postures of attacked entities, and in legal investigation of cybercrime cases. Response and Recovery  capabilities are required essentially for any entity targeted by cyberattacks, that is, almost anyone possessing  financial assets, IP assets, personal data, or sometimes just computational resources. Examples are operators of  critical infrastructures, organizations in such domains as defence, law enforcement, and gaming and gambling, but  also SME’s and other smaller organizations with their specific constraints. The main objective is to validate and  demonstrate an integrated security infrastructure supporting the Respond and Recover processes that are  appropriate to the technical, business and threat environment that is prevalent in the year 2020.  Proven and standardized techniques and practices of security log management, incident reporting, cost-based  Response and Recovery decision-making, and incident information sharing will also enable more effective and timely  cooperation in resolving incidents and higher preparedness of the users to dealing with incidents and their  consequences. The technological and operational enablers of cooperation in Response and Recovery will contribute  to the development of the CSIRT Network, which is one of the key targets of the NIS Directive.27  1.8.6 Remove trust barriers for data-driven applications and services  Data security and privacy is a very wide field. Europe has traditionally been very conscious about protecting user  privacy. In this aspect, it has developed the technical expertise to lead the area of data protection and it has  developed the political will that can help push innovative solutions into the market. As an impact, it is expected that  companies will turn to solutions that ensure better data protection and better privacy for the end users. The scope  of innovations in the topic will create secure and privacy aware data processing and storage, balance privacy needs  and business demands, and facilitate the implementation of the regulatory context (e.g. the GDPR).28  ID and Distributed trust management (including Distributed Ledger technology) refers to the future of  authentication/authorization. Europe has successfully invested into distributed identity and trust management and  enjoys a better reputation for decentralized and privacy-friendly services than several other areas. The need for  distributed trust management combined with the need for privacy may lead to significant innovation in the market.  As an impact of the innovations in the field, flexible authentication and authorisation schemes will come to existence,  authentication will operate in a distributed fashion without single points of failure on critical paths, distributed trust  management frameworks will be largely adopted. This impact will satisfy the ambitions of the GDPR in terms of  enhancing data protection, and the NIS Directive in building more resilient information systems.29  User centric security and privacy solutions aim at guaranteeing the privacy and security of citizen’s data. Identity  protection and privacy are topics of general interest for different markets since they are transversal to several areas  and can be used for digital services. European companies need to protect their customers’ personal information and  respect the emerging data privacy regulation, while at the same time enabling their usage in smarter and more  secure digital services and giving the right visibility and control to the user. The challenge of adapting authentication  to the conditions of the environment or the critical level of the operation being performed by the user is a key issue  for service providers, invoked by the GDPR or the Privacy-by-design provisions of the eIDAS regulation. Investment  in the area should result in increased awareness in privacy leading to a decrease of identity theft, new best practices  and usable technologies in authentication for both digital service providers and end users that enable user-centric  security and privacy.  1.8.7 Maintain a secure and trusted infrastructure in the long-term  ICT infrastructure protection is one of the most challenging dimensions of cyber security, considering the speed and  scope of cyber-attacks or incidents. The increased interconnections created within the Internet as well as between  27 more details on the topic: https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/csirt-cert-services?tab=publications  28 more details on the topic: https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/data-protection/security-of-personal- data?tab=publications  29 more details on the topic: https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/blockchain-security  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/csirt-cert-services?tab=publications https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/data-protection/security-of-personal-data?tab=publications https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/data-protection/security-of-personal-data?tab=publications https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/blockchain-security  Priorities for EU research  Analysis of the ECSO Strategic Research and Innovation Agenda (SRIA)  December 2017  20  the Internet and the internal communication networks of critical infrastructures have made our society vulnerable  to attacks that spread across hundreds of thousands of computers, mobile devices or even intelligent connected  objects. In addition, the ICT infrastructure has become increasingly flexible, scalable and open.  Member States must be in control of their state-based critical networks, systems and platforms, and must be able  to protect them from threats. Otherwise, the risk is high that citizens become reluctant to use these services. Privacy  remains a key issue that can only be supported if the entire architecture of ICT services is considered secure, safe  and resilient to threats. Given the expected impact of the density of devices and users in the infrastructures,  virtualization of the resources in the infrastructures seems the more sustainable option that need to deal with  security and scalability problems among others. Research with particular interest in ICT infrastructure protection  focuses on services; cloud infrastructures, including all the computing, networking and data components; and  trusted networking infrastructures and virtualization. The scope of innovations should focus on areas of threat  management, network security, protocol transition / migration to secure systems, secure execution environment,  and device and system security. The impact of the innovations will result in a higher security level of infrastructures,  supporting the implementation of the NIS directive.30  Quantum resistant cryptography aims to solve the emerging threat that large-scale quantum computers will be able  to break current standard asymmetric cryptographic algorithms in a matter of hours. As cryptographic functionality  is a core component for cybersecurity, this will have serious implications, in particular to medical data and data in  classified systems related to national security. In addition, the number of IoT devices will grow significantly in the  next decade, so the development of software, hardware, and key management technologies is core to address the  emerging threat.  The scope of research should focus on quantum-safe cryptographic methods and algorithms for both asymmetric  and symmetric cryptography, transition from present-day cryptographic systems to quantum-resistant  cryptography, and developing evaluation criteria for quantum-resistant public key cryptographic standards and  implementations.  1.8.8 Intelligent approaches to eliminate security vulnerabilities in systems, services and applications  Trusted supply chain for resilient systems focuses on trust and dependency on consumed Cloud Services from third  parties. There are many solutions developed to ensure not only the security and dependability aspects but also the  data protection and privacy provisions of the Cloud Service Providers. Industry advocates cloud SLAs for  transparency and applied security controls, but the lack of models, mechanisms and tools for supporting dynamicity  in SLAs is still a challenge. Evidence based Cloud certification is a new approach to be explored.  The Digital Single Market will require collaboration and open innovation from stakeholders to create competitive  added value. An average single company in Europe (i.e. SMEs) can hardly address the whole service supply chain by  their own in the environment of IoT, inter-cloud environments, Industry 4.0, etc. The scope of innovations should  focus on methods for developing resilient systems out of potentially insecure components, their certification and  security assurance methodologies, enhancing open source security. The impact will be increased trust along the  supply chain, with solutions for certified systems instead of certified components.  Security-by-design is the concept that software and hardware must be designed with privacy and security in mind  from planning to implementation. This best practice is already mandatory in certain industries especially those  involved in embedded, industrial, technical and scientific software like defence, aerospace, energy, hi-tech and  spreading to telecom and finance. Europe enjoys a high reputation for Privacy and Security-by-Design, as enforced  by the GDPR and the Privacy-by-design provisions of the eIDAS regulation. The scope of developments should focus  on methods and tools for developing privacy enhancing and secure software and hardware, security and privacy  30 more details on the topic: https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/critical-information-infrastructures-and- services/internet-infrastructure?tab=publications  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/critical-information-infrastructures-and-services/internet-infrastructure?tab=publications https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/critical-information-infrastructures-and-services/internet-infrastructure?tab=publications  Priorities for EU research  Analysis of the ECSO Strategic Research and Innovation Agenda (SRIA)  December 2017  21  INDUSTRY 4.0 ENERGY TRANSPORT EHEALTH  SMART  CITIES &  BUILDINGS  EPUBLIC  SERVICES  FINANCE  TELCO/ISP/ CONTENT  PROVIDERS  IoT/IP enabled  devices  x  x  Access and Identity  management  x  x x x  Cloud based  infrastructure/SDN/N FV  x  x  x  Big Data / data  science  x  x x  Authorization/Authen tication  x  x x x  x x  Automation/Robotics x  Privacy/Data  Protection  x x x x x x x x  Cryptograpy/encrypti on  x  x  x  Embedded systems x  x x x x  Tamperproof  communication  protocols  x x x x x x x x  Navigation systems  x  Anonymization/pseud onynamization  x  x  x  Machine learning/AI x x  x  Cyber crisis  simulation  x  Cross domain sensing  and analysis  x  x  Cascading effects of  disruptions  x x x  x  x  Risk and impact on  human health and  safety  x  x  Priorities for EU research  Analysis of the ECSO Strategic Research and Innovation Agenda (SRIA)  December 2017  22  architectures, and secure deployment. Impacted beneficiaries will be software developers and suppliers within  vertical market segments, as well as the security consumers and the end-users by measurable improved security and  privacy levels and efficiency gain and increased trust both by developers using the components and by end-users.31  1.8.9 From security components to security services  Advanced Security Services focuses on the processes required to provide, manage, measure, certify, restore, etc.  privacy and security, and the tools required to support them. Any entity, from individuals to large enterprises and  governments, has a need of cybersecurity functions of certain types. Most common services include consulting and  IT outsourcing, managed security services, managed detection and response. The cybersecurity services market is at  the moment led by North American players, however, the availability of cybersecurity services from European  providers is often of high importance due to such matters as trust, requirements of laws and regulations, existing  business relationships, subtle cultural aspects, etc. To stay globally competitive, the European cybersecurity industry  must aim at leading positions in delivering comprehensive services to end-customers and avoid the confines of the  technology provider role. Projects should address technology-, process-, and business-related aspects of building  and running cybersecurity services, including approaches to service quality assessment to support customers in their  service and provider selection efforts. SLA models are important business ingredients of cybersecurity services,  influenced by the choices of security tools and technologies, platforms for integrating those and delivering services  to the customers, and expertise of the service provider’s personnel. The efforts should support the implementation  of the NIS Directive in enabling and shaping collaboration between service providers, CSIRTs, and other relevant  organizations.  Impact analysis of the R&D proposals in the context of the GDPR and the NIS  Directive  The objective of this document is to provide an analysis of areas covered by the NIS Directive and the GDPR where  R&D activities would achieve the greatest impact. The ECSO SRIA document proposes a complex system for areas of  research, which allows to suggest concrete areas for funding with rationale for their choice. The impact analysis  maps the cyber security related research needs of the vertical sectors (application domains), and makes an  assumption on the priority of research topics based on their reusability, and their importance in the security/privacy- by-design concept.  Table 2 The vertical domains and their anticipated fields of research  Table 2 provides an overview of each sector in terms of their technological needs. By the description of each sector  given in the section above, the following assumptions can be made:  31 more details on the topic: https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/data-protection/privacy-by- design?tab=publications  Cyber risk modelling  and management  x  x x  Awareness and  incident response  x x  Vulnerability testing x  x  x  Cyber insurance  x  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/data-protection/privacy-by-design?tab=publications https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/data-protection/privacy-by-design?tab=publications  Priorities for EU research  Analysis of the ECSO Strategic Research and Innovation Agenda (SRIA)  December 2017  23  - The prime area of interest by the vertical sectors in terms of R&D activities is privacy/data protection. This  is a broad topic that can be broken down to technological components. Most of the topics in the matrix can  be regarded as enablers of better privacy/data protection solutions.  - By selecting more specific areas of R&D, secure communication protocols and authentication/authorization  methods seem to be the common interest for the verticals. Both topics can be regarded as technical  safeguards that will ensure more resilient infrastructures and information systems, thus adhering to the  measures of the GDPR and the NIS Directive.  - The matrix also shows that the Industry 4.0 and the eHealth sector seem to be the most research-intensive  sectors.  - An interesting observation is that cyber crisis simulation and the research of cascading effects also exhibit  an outstanding area to be explored aside the technical related topics.  The impact analysis further maps the cyber security related research fields in Table 3 based on the needs of the  cyber transversal infrastructures. Contrary to the vertical sectors, the transversals focus their research needs more  on trust and resiliency, as the stakeholders represent a horizontal cross section of the digital society. The areas of  interest support in the implementation of the NIS Directive. The table below indicates that the main interest in all  transversals is in usable and actionable information on threats, whereas high-assurance prevention and protection  requires the biggest number of security components.

The NIS  Directive puts emphasis on cooperation and collaboration on national and international level, so strengthening these  beneficiaries with the implementation of the innovation and research results will enhance European cyber security  resiliency, as well as raise the European competitiveness on the global cyber security market.  Both vertical sectors and transversal infrastructures define their needs in terms technical research. To address these  needs, the ECSO SRIA document defines the scopes of cyber technical projects with a given set of themes and  technical topics. By conducting research in the given topic, its product can be used in either the verticals or the  transversals. The scope of the cyber technical projects is listed below with the anticipated topics of research.  - Remove trust barriers for data-driven applications and services: authentication, AIM, privacy, encryption;  - Maintain a secure and trusted infrastructure in the long-term: awareness raising, threat intelligence and  management, network security and secure environments, cryptography;  - Intelligent approaches to eliminate security vulnerabilities in systems, services and applications:  certification, open source security, privacy-by-design;  - From security components to security services: security analysis, security monitoring and management,  incident response, forensics, threat intelligence, certification.  The outcome of the research projects will be the building blocks for the vertical sectors and transversal  infrastructures from which they can leverage their respective needs.  Importance and alignment with global trends in cyber security  The ECSO SRIA makes suggestions to research and innovation in the context of the global cyber security landscape.  In 2016, the EU Cyber Security Market was estimated at €20.1bn and compares favourably with the cybersecurity  market of other global regions. The CAGR of the EU market however is 6%, whereas the average growth rate is  around 8%, and is growing slower than all other major regions32, so Europe needs extra effort to catch up with the  global trend. The document identifies the current characteristics of the European market that inhibit leadership as  listed below:  - Europe’s share of the global economy is declining due to slower growth.  - The EU market is fragmented in practice, making growth difficult.  - Funding shortages and entrepreneurial support.  - Europe procurement policies focus too much on short-term savings without promoting customer-vendor  partnerships needed for innovation.  - Less investment in R&D and little market success.  - Skills shortages.  - European companies favour execution over strategic vision.  32 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/enisa-position-papers-and-opinions/cybersecurity-as-an-economic- enabler, p1  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/enisa-position-papers-and-opinions/cybersecurity-as-an-economic-enabler https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/enisa-position-papers-and-opinions/cybersecurity-as-an-economic-enabler  Priorities for EU research  Analysis of the ECSO Strategic Research and Innovation Agenda (SRIA)  December 2017  25  On the other hand, however, Europe places special emphasis on safeguarding its citizens and securing its  infrastructure, by means of the overarching legislations, such as the GDPR and the NIS Directive, to reach toward a  sustainable Digital Single Market. The objective of the cPPP is to bridge the gap between capacity building and the  deployment of trusted European cyber security solutions on European and international markets. To address the  global trends and to overcome the current European gaps, there need to be coordinated cyber security actions  within the EU that call for the swift implementation of cyber security strategies at the EU, national, and regional  levels and the promotion of European cyber security and privacy research and innovation. Parallel to this activity,  there is a need for a more active outreach to the world-wide research communities to promote international cyber  security and privacy research and innovation activities.  Priorities for EU research  Analysis of the ECSO Strategic Research and Innovation Agenda (SRIA)  December 2017  26  2. Conclusions  Cybersecurity is an essential enabling factor for the development and exploitation of digital technologies and  innovation and is, therefore, linked to future prospects for growth, job creation and Europe’s response to  environmental and societal goals. Specifically, Europe’s ambitions to develop or reinforce its leadership in key  economic areas (e.g. health, energy, transport, finance, Industry 4.0, communications and public services) must be  supported by cybersecurity solutions that meet the needs of emerging digital markets.  The ECSO SRIA report highlights the potential topics for research and innovation related to cyber security for the  H2020 Work Programme that fosters the consolidation and growth of the European cyber security market and  industry. It describes the recommended topics for the H2020 calls in the format for the H2020 calls, i.e. specific  challenge, scope, expected impact, topic budget and time planned for the call. In addition, further reasoning is  included on how to better motivate the choice of the suggested topics, including the market, the rationale for  covering the specific areas at European level, the target users and other elements. The document in itself also refers  to the currently dominant EU legislations and guidelines that need to be adhered to, specifically the GDPR, the NIS  Directive, the eIDAS or the Digital Agenda.  According to the ECSO SRIA, the success factor to meet the overall objectives are the capabilities and competences  of the human resources involved within the process and the ability of all the involved stakeholders to collaborate  and cooperate across public and private organisations, Member States and at international level. The ECSO proposes  a contractual public-private partnership (cPPP) to address the main strategic objectives to be achieved, which are:  - The protection from cyber threats of the growth of the European Digital Single Market;  - The creation of a strong European-based offering and an equal level playing field to meet the needs of the  emerging digital market with trustworthy and privacy aware solutions;  - The growth and the presence of Europe’s cybersecurity industry in the global market.  Although the ECSO SRIA sets the objectives for the cPPP, its focus remains on the context of the H2020, and it will  not be able to solve policy activities and research and innovation funding that goes parallel or beyond H2020. There  are gaps remaining, especially with the alignment of the European regulatory framework, namely the GDPR and the  NIS Directive.  Gaps in EU legislation  The GDPR addresses the overall protection of European citizens and is therefore not sector-specific by nature. The  regulation does not reference cyber security, critical infrastructures, or any of the vertical sectors defined in the SRIA  document, however, provisions of the regulation must be applied in the process of personal data collection and  usage. The GDPR aims to encourage innovation, as long as organizations implement the appropriate safeguards. The  regulation adopts a “broad” definition of research, encompassing the activities of both public and private entities.  However, it remains unclear whether research for product improvement, corporate beta-testing or market research  purposes would be considered scientific research. This important interpretative question is likely to be taken up by  data protection authorities and advisory bodies. In the age of big data, where the data analytics activities of many  organizations may qualify as research, it is unclear exactly how far the GDPR’s research exemption will extend.  Involvement of legal expertise will be crucial as the regulation does not provide exact definitions that can be applied  out of the box.  The NIS Directive specifies measures with a view to achieving a high common level of security of networks and  information systems within the EU to improve the functioning of the internal real and digital market. It sets the  Priorities for EU research  Analysis of the ECSO Strategic Research and Innovation Agenda (SRIA)  December 2017  27  baseline capabilities for each Member State, however many of the definitions of these capabilities still remain open  in the context of set-up, methodology or content. While the priority areas are set by the ECSO SRIA, the  implementation of research and innovation will only be successful if the regulatory environment will have a common  definition and implementation of the provisions under the NIS Directive. By way of examples33:  - A common European threat and risk landscape to understand and address the threat and risks, inclusive of  all vertical domains is still missing.  - The information sharing on threats, risks and vulnerabilities is not well defined and lacks a common  classification scheme applicable to the vertical domains.  - The harmonization of criteria for the identification of operators of essential services is not available.  - A EU-wide accepted cyber response framework is missing that should include the necessary processes in  case of cyber attacks.  - A minimum level of maturity has to be agreed when a maturity framework is available.  - The harmonization of security implementation across the European Union is not sufficiently addressed.  - A supply chain and integrity framework is not available as of the date of writing.  - There are no common incident reporting criteria defined that the vertical sectors can refer to.  - The cooperation with EU and Non-EU countries and international organisations is not or only partially  defined.  - Crisis management frameworks do not address cyber security incidents and attacks for all vertical domains.  Alignment with previous Strategic Research Agenda  Identification and prioritising of forthcoming research and innovation topics should be performed in close  collaboration with industrial stakeholders across Europe towards a more focused and coordinated approach. In the  previous years, the European Network and Information Security (NIS) Platform was the vehicle where the key  challenges and desired outcomes in terms of innovation-focused, basic and applied research in the fields of cyber  security, privacy, and trust were identified. As an outcome of the NIS Platform's work, a Strategic Research Agenda  (SRA)34 was published, that outlines the key objectives of the desired research priorities as follows:  - Fostering assurance  - Focussing on data  - Enabling secure execution  - Preserving privacy  - Increasing trust  - Managing cyber risks  - Protecting ICT infrastructures  - Achieving user-centricity  The Digital Single Market strategy together with Horizon 2020 introduced the concept of cPPP that will focus on  Research and Innovation but also go beyond and address measures that can help impose connection to end users,  improve the reporting of validation activities with users of research results and promote participation of relevant EU  Industry. In case of cyber security, this is realized by the ECSO, and the SRIA document clearly follows the key  33 https://ec.europa.eu/energy/sites/ener/files/documents/eecsp_report_final.pdf  34 https://resilience.enisa.europa.eu/nis-platform/shared-documents/wg3-documents/strategic-research-agenda- final-v0.96/at_download/file  https://ec.europa.eu/energy/sites/ener/files/documents/eecsp_report_final.pdf https://resilience.enisa.europa.eu/nis-platform/shared-documents/wg3-documents/strategic-research-agenda-final-v0.96/at_download/file https://resilience.enisa.europa.eu/nis-platform/shared-documents/wg3-documents/strategic-research-agenda-final-v0.96/at_download/file  Priorities for EU research  Analysis of the ECSO Strategic Research and Innovation Agenda (SRIA)  December 2017  28  objectives of the SRA document of the NIS Platform. In terms of the fields covered among the focus areas of the  SRIA, it can be stated with high confidence that the complementary projects proposed will cover all aspects of cyber  security. The cyber security eco-system will create the baseline capabilities, the cyber pilots will address various  vertical sector-specific needs, the cyber transversal infrastructures will enhance the cooperation requirements of  the determinant EU cyber legislations, and the technical projects will provide the innovative technical solutions, as  building blocks, for vertical domains and the transversal infrastructures.  Governance and promotion  When discussing the potential research areas that are designed to lead or regain European competitiveness in the  cyber security market, the concept of governance needs to be taken into consideration. This is a task that goes  beyond the scope of ECSO and their research proposal. However, the governance of ECSO provides some insight on  how the organisation approaches involvement in research. The Bylaws of ECSO35 sets the roles and responsibilities  of its members and governing bodies, with special attention to the cPPP. The cPPP encompasses a Partnership Board  (PB), which comprises of ECSO and EC representatives. The main objective of the Board is to discuss the annual  priorities of the Horizon 2020 Cybersecurity Work Program, the implementation of the overall R&D program related  topics and the monitoring of the cPPP commitments. The ESCO representatives to the PB undertake not to influence  the implementation of the H2020 programme, or be involved in the preparation or evaluation of related calls. This  should limit any conflict of interest from ECSO’s behalf.  Furthermore, the ECSO recommends the formation of a European Cybersecurity Council, which would be a high level  advisory body not belonging to the ECSO but closely linked to it. A European Cybersecurity Council would assess at  a high level the work of the cPPP as well as provide the ECSO Board and the cPPP Partnership Board with guidelines  and commitment for a longer term strategy. It would be composed by relevant CEOs/executive decision makers  from Association Members, members of the European Parliament and of National Authorities as well as the relevant  Commissioners and high-level representative from the European Institutions. The European Cybersecurity Council is  yet to be established.  Areas not covered by the ECSO SRIA  In terms of gaps or uncovered areas, it is important to bear in mind that the ECSO was established to foster cyber  security R&D within the H2020 framework. There are some areas, e.g. national security, defence, nuclear energy,  aviation, online content development, online child protection, or general awareness raising that do not fit in the  context of H2020, therefore the ECSO SRIA does not take this into consideration. However, through other funding  schemes (as listed in previous section) the EU provides mechanisms to fill these gaps to ensure that all cyber related  societal challenges are addressed. Promotion and dissemination of R&D results falls out of the scope of ECSO, thus  it is not covered by the SRIA document. By nature, all research projects plan with dissemination activities, but the  SRIA does not include any overarching promotion and dissemination plan to position ECSO as a technology transfer  or research brokerage platform in the EU R&D landscape. These activities are to be carried out in other existing  mechanisms, such as CORDIS36.  What is already in place  Regardless of the cPPP between ECSO and the EC, H2020 is ongoing with its calls in the digital security focus area.  Up to date, seven calls in digital security have been published, and two calls are open at the time of writing. Three  calls were specifically addressing the cPPP for proposals. The areas of focus for the cyber security related calls are:  - Assurance and Certification for Trustworthy and Secure ICT systems, services and components;  35 http://www.ecs-org.eu/documents/uploads/591d55b9be0a6.pdf  36 Community Research and Development Information Service, http://cordis.europa.eu/guidance/home_en.html  http://www.ecs-org.eu/documents/uploads/591d55b9be0a6.pdf http://cordis.europa.eu/guidance/home_en.html  Priorities for EU research  Analysis of the ECSO Strategic Research and Innovation Agenda (SRIA)  December 2017  29  - Cyber Security for SMEs, local public administration and Individuals;  - Increasing digital security of health-related data on a systemic level;  - Economics of Cybersecurity;  - EU Cooperation and International Dialogues in Cybersecurity and Privacy Research and Innovation;  - Cybersecurity PPP: Cryptography;  - Cybersecurity PPP: Addressing Advanced Cyber Security Threats and Threat Actors;  - Cybersecurity PPP: Privacy, Data Protection, Digital Identities.37  Preceding H2020, a number of initiatives and cooperation mechanisms have been started in the field of critical  information infrastructure protection and combatting cybercrime. There are a number of existing national and EU- wide information exchange mechanisms38, mainly being formed on a voluntary basis. Most Member States have  national/governmental CSIRTs that cooperate with each other and with various critical sectors. There are  European agencies, such as Europol or ENISA that foster multilateral cooperation in the field of information  security and combatting cybercrime. The number of best practices built up over the past ten years led to the  considerations laid down in the NIS Directive. All this provides a firm background to the current and future  implementation of research activities carried out in the context of the ECSO SRIA.  37 https://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/portal/desktop/en/opportunities/h2020/calls/h2020-ds-2016- 2017.html#c,topics=callIdentifier/t/H2020-DS-2016-2017/1/1/1/default- group&callStatus/t/Forthcoming/1/1/0/default-group&callStatus/t/Open/1/1/0/default- group&callStatus/t/Closed/1/1/0/default-group&+identifier/desc (opened on 15 August 2017)  38 more details on the topic: https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/cross-cooperation-for-csirts  https://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/portal/desktop/en/opportunities/h2020/calls/h2020-ds-2016-2017.html#c,topics=callIdentifier/t/H2020-DS-2016-2017/1/1/1/default-group&callStatus/t/Forthcoming/1/1/0/default-group&callStatus/t/Open/1/1/0/default-group&callStatus/t/Closed/1/1/0/default-group&+identifier/desc (opened on 15 https://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/portal/desktop/en/opportunities/h2020/calls/h2020-ds-2016-2017.html#c,topics=callIdentifier/t/H2020-DS-2016-2017/1/1/1/default-group&callStatus/t/Forthcoming/1/1/0/default-group&callStatus/t/Open/1/1/0/default-group&callStatus/t/Closed/1/1/0/default-group&+identifier/desc (opened on 15 https://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/portal/desktop/en/opportunities/h2020/calls/h2020-ds-2016-2017.html#c,topics=callIdentifier/t/H2020-DS-2016-2017/1/1/1/default-group&callStatus/t/Forthcoming/1/1/0/default-group&callStatus/t/Open/1/1/0/default-group&callStatus/t/Closed/1/1/0/default-group&+identifier/desc (opened on 15 https://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/portal/desktop/en/opportunities/h2020/calls/h2020-ds-2016-2017.html#c,topics=callIdentifier/t/H2020-DS-2016-2017/1/1/1/default-group&callStatus/t/Forthcoming/1/1/0/default-group&callStatus/t/Open/1/1/0/default-group&callStatus/t/Closed/1/1/0/default-group&+identifier/desc (opened on 15 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/cross-cooperation-for-csirts  Priorities for EU research  Analysis of the ECSO Strategic Research and Innovation Agenda (SRIA)  December 2017  30  3.

Cyber security is an essential enabling factor for the development and exploitation  of digital technologies and innovation and is, therefore, linked to future prospects for growth, job creation and  Europe’s response to environmental and societal goals. To facilitate the EU's ambition, Horizon 2020, the biggest  ever EU research and innovation programme is under way to foster R&D and innovation across Europe.  As part of the H2020 programme, the EC signed a contractual private-public partnership (cPPP) with the European  Cyber Security Organisation (ECSO), an industry-led contractual counterpart in July 2016. The aim of the  partnership is to bridge the gap between capacity building and the deployment of trusted European cybersecurity  solutions on European and international markets. The cPPP can be regarded as a key element of the master plan in  structuring and coordinating cyber security industrial resources in Europe. As part of the contractual obligations,  the ECSO drafted a Strategic Research and Innovation Agenda (SRIA) that identifies seven priority areas of R&D in  the field of cyber security, each of them broken down to headings that analyse the given priority in detail, making  suggestions for potential topics for calls for proposals in the framework of H2020. (Annex II outlines the priority  areas.)  From another aspect, Europe has also an opportunity to put policies in place to ensure that minimum security  requirements are put in place in digital products and services to ensure safety and security of the European  citizens and their data. There are two concurrent EU legislations, the General Data Protection Regulation2 (GDPR)  and the NIS Directive, 3that will have an ultimate impact on the next generation of goods and services in the cyber  domain in Europe and beyond. Both legislations are enablers of the Digital Single Market, and with this, Europe  should capitalise on the state-of-the-art cyber security to give Europe a competitive advantage.  The objective of this current document is to provide an analysis of the research proposals of the ECSO SRIA  document by briefly summarizing each research priority, and highlighting the areas where the priorities have to be  aligned with the provisions of the GDPR and the NIS Directive. The document endeavours to identify the most  research intensive vertical domains and transversal infrastructure, and match these with the most relevant areas  of cyber security research. The document also places the European cyber security environment in the global  context, and identifies the inhibiting factors of European leadership in the market.  1 https://europa.eu/european-union/file/1497/download_en?token=KzfSz- CR&usg=AOvVaw3RadlBjrZ19TcVzB4VsXOc  2 http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/reform/files/regulation_oj_en.pdf&usg=AOvVaw36C2K- 6DsRW98BUZ3iYgI5  3 http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32016L1148  Priorities for EU research  Analysis of the ECSO Strategic Research and Innovation Agenda (SRIA)  December 2017  06  1.

The background to the Security Research and Innovation Agenda report is the European Commission’s contractual  arrangement on a public-private partnership for cybersecurity industrial research and innovation between the  European Union and the stakeholder organisation represented by the European Cyber Security Organisation  (ECSO)5 association.  The following sections introduce the cybersecurity specific legislative environment of the EU that impact the future  research activities and the available funding schemes that foster R&D activities in the EU.  The EC approach to cyber security  The current approach to CIIP and resilience within the EU has its roots in the Commission communication of 2009,  entitled ‘Protecting Europe from large-scale cyber-attacks and disruptions: enhancing preparedness, security and  resilience6 . In 2013, the Commission released the Cybersecurity Strategy of the EU7 , which laid down a number of  fundamental principles underlying the EU approach to cybersecurity, including the need of achieving cyber  resilience, strong and effective legislation on the cyber domain, the promotion of a Single Market for cyber  security products, and fostering R&D investments and innovation.  The key challenges and priorities of the EU Cybersecurity Strategy are each addressed by separate but coherent  actions and legislations detailed below.  Digital Agenda  The Digital Agenda (2010-2020) proposes to better exploit the potential of info-communication technologies (ICTs)  in order to foster innovation, economic growth and progress.  The Digital Agenda's main objective is to develop a Digital Single Market  (DSM)8 in order to generate smart,  sustainable and inclusive growth in Europe, and it consists of the seven pillars below:   Achieving the digital single market   Enhancing interoperability and standards   Strengthening online trust and security   Promoting fast and reliable Internet access for all   Investing in research and innovation   Promoting digital literacy, skills and inclusion  4 http://www.ecs-org.eu/documents/publications/59e615c9dd8f1.pdf  5 http://ecso-org.eu/  6 Commission Communication of March 2009, “Protecting Europe from large-scale cyber-attacks and disruptions:  enhancing preparedness, security and resilience”, COM(2009)149.  7 Joint Communication on the Cybersecurity Strategy of the European Union: An Open, Safe and Secure Cyberspace,  available at: http://eeas.europa.eu/policies/eu-cyber-security/cybsec_comm_en.pdf  8 https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en  http://ecso-org.eu/  Priorities for EU research  Analysis of the ECSO Strategic Research and Innovation Agenda (SRIA)  December 2017  07   ICT-enabled benefits for EU society  The GDPR and the NIS Directive  This document takes two concurrent pieces of EU legislations into consideration, namely the General Data Protection  Regulation (GDPR) and the NIS Directive. Both pieces of legislation are enablers of the DMS, having an ultimate  impact on the next generation of goods, services, and content and cooperation models in the cyber domain in Europe  and beyond.  The NIS Directive is the first piece of EU legislation specifically aimed at improving cybersecurity  throughout the EU. By imposing a certain number of obligations for all Member States, the Directive will help ensure  a consistent approach to cybersecurity. This in itself represents a very significant step in the approach to securing  EU information systems and improving the functioning of the internal market.  The GDPR is designed to control the processing of personal data. Its rules are in the form of a Regulation, imposing  data protection standards that will be the same in all 28 EU Member States. Enforcement will be the responsibility  of each Member State, but the GDPR also encourages centralised co-ordination of enforcement across the EU. The  GDPR focuses on the protection and processing of personal data, and does not address the critical infrastructures.  The GDPR and the NIS Directive are complimentary initiatives with the shared goal of modernizing and  harmonizing system and data protection frameworks across the EU. The GDPR will give EU citizens stronger rights,  empowering them with better control of their data and ensuring that their privacy remains protected in the digital  age. The NIS Directive is complementary to the GDPR, aimed at the protection of IT systems in critical national  infrastructure for the EU. Table 1 provides a brief comparison of the two legislations:  GDPR NIS DIRECTIVE  Primary Goals  Regulation to achieve a general EU framework for  data protection  Directive on protecting personal data processed  for prevention, detection, investigation or  prosecution of criminal offenses and related  judicial activities  Improve cyber security capabilities in the Member  States  Improve Member States’ cooperation on cyber  security  Directive concerning measures to ensure a  standard high level of network and information  security across the EU  Organizations  Impacted  Data controllers and data processors  Essentially any organization with ‘Personal Data’  Operators of essential services in the energy,  transport, banking and healthcare sectors  Providers of critical digital services like search  engines and cloud computing  Enforcement  Data breaches must be reported as soon as  possible and, where feasible, no later than 72  hours after discovery of a breach.  Regulation will apply to companies  headquartered outside of Europe as long as they  have operations in Europe. Data Transfers to third  countries and international organizations may  only be carried out in full compliance with this  Regulation Requires Data Protection Officer  Requires operators of essential services in the  energy, transport, banking and healthcare sectors,  and providers of critical digital services like search  engines and cloud computing, to take appropriate  security measures and report incidents to the  national authorities  Member States will be required to designate a  national competent authority for the  implementation and enforcement of the  Directive, as well as CSIRTs responsible for  handling incidents and risks  https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-data-protection/key-definitions/ http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-15-6270_en.htm  Priorities for EU research  Analysis of the ECSO Strategic Research and Innovation Agenda (SRIA)  December 2017  08  Penalties  Maximum penalties for data breaches are now 4%  of global revenue or 20M Euro, whichever is  higher  Penalties and fines yet to be clearly defined  Effective Date May 25, 2018  The NIS Directive was published in the Official  Journal of the European Union on July 19, 2016.  Member States have until May 9, 2018 to  implement this Directive into national laws and a  further six months to identify “operators of  essential services.”  Table 1 A brief comparison of the GDPR and the NIS Directive  eIDAS9  Electronic identification (eID) and electronic Trust Services (eTS) are key enablers for secure cross-border  electronic transactions and central building blocks of the Digital Single Market. The eIDAS Regulation ensures that  people and businesses can use their own national electronic identification schemes (eIDs) to access public services  in other EU countries where eIDs are available. It also creates a European internal market for eTS - namely  electronic signatures, electronic seals, time stamp, electronic delivery service and website authentication - by  ensuring that they will work across borders and have the same legal status as traditional paper based processes.  With eIDAS, the EU has managed to lay down the right foundations and a predictable legal framework for people,  companies (in particular SMEs) and public administrations to safely access services and do transactions online and  across border in just \"one click\".  In terms of relevance to this document, the eIDAS Regulation bears several  overlapping provisions with the GDPR and the NIS Directive in setting a secure environment for eID and eTS.  Privacy-by-design and data breach notification are appearing in the GDPR, while security requirements of trust  service providers, compliment the aims of the NIS Directive in building resilient infrastructures and services. The  intent of eIDAS is to drive innovation. By adhering to the guidelines set for technology under eIDAS, organizations  are pushed towards using higher levels of information security and innovation.10  9 Regulation (EU) 910/2014 on electronic identification and trust services for electronic transactions in the internal  market, adopted on 23 July 2014, http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal- content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32014R0910&from=EN  10 more details on the topic: https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/trust-services?tab=publications  http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32014R0910&from=EN http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32014R0910&from=EN https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/trust-services?tab=publications  Priorities for EU research  Analysis of the ECSO Strategic Research and Innovation Agenda (SRIA)  December 2017  09  R&D activities and funding schemes  As a key priority to foster R&D and innovation across Europe, a structure of research facilities and funding schemes  is in place to provide expertise and management to research and innovation projects and to promote synergies  between these activities, to benefit economic growth and EU citizens. The beneficiaries of the funding programmes  include SMEs, research centres, universities, large companies, the types of funds range from supporting start-ups to  various clusters.  The Connecting Europe Facility (CEF) is a key EU funding instrument to promote growth, jobs and competitiveness  through targeted infrastructure investment at European level. It supports the development of high performing,  sustainable and efficiently interconnected trans-European networks in the fields of transport, energy and digital  services. CEF investments aim to fill the missing links in Europe's main infrastructural backbone. The Innovation and  Networks Executive Agency (INEA) is responsible for the technical and financial management of the programme.  Horizon 2020 is the biggest running EU research and innovation programme. Almost €79 billion of funding is  available over seven years (2014 to 2020). H2020 will help to achieve smart, sustainable and inclusive economic  growth. The goal is to ensure that Europe produces world-class science and technology, removes barriers to  innovation and makes it easier for the public and private sectors to work together in delivering solutions to big  challenges facing our society. In the course of implementing the programme, H2020 will build on the experience of  public private partnerships. The programme objectives are coordinated by various European bodies and agencies.  Funding schemes by EC General Directorates: The European Commission makes direct financial contributions in the  form of grants to projects or organisations which help implement EU programmes or policies. Amongst others, DG  CONNECT11, DG JUSTICE12, DG Migration and Home Affairs13 run various funding programmes in the field of cyber  security.  The European Cyber Security Organization (ECSO)14  The European Cyber Security Organisation (ECSO) ASBL is a not-for-profit organisation under Belgian law, established  in June 2016. ECSO represents an industry-led contractual counterpart to the European Commission for the  implementation of the cyber security contractual Public-Private Partnership (cPPP). ECSO members include a wide  variety of stakeholders such as large companies, SMEs and Start-ups, research centres, universities, end-users,  operators, clusters and associations as well as European Member State’s local, regional and national administrations,  countries part of the European Economic Area (EEA) and the European Free Trade Association (EFTA) and H2020  associated countries. The main objective of ECSO is to support all types of initiatives or projects that aim to develop,  promote, encourage European cybersecurity, and in particular to:  - Foster and protect the growth of the European Digital Single Market from cyber threats;  - Develop the cybersecurity market in Europe and the growth of a competitive cybersecurity and ICT industry,  with an increased market position;  11 Digital Single Market-related topics and projects, https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/funding  12 Rights, Equality and Citizenship Programme 2014-2020, http://ec.europa.eu/justice/grants1/programmes-2014- 2020/rec/index_en.htm  13 Security programmes, https://ec.europa.eu/home-affairs/financing/fundings_en  14 http://ecs-org.eu/about  https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/funding http://ec.europa.eu/justice/grants1/programmes-2014-2020/rec/index_en.htm http://ec.europa.eu/justice/grants1/programmes-2014-2020/rec/index_en.htm https://ec.europa.eu/home-affairs/financing/fundings_en http://ecs-org.eu/about  Priorities for EU research  Analysis of the ECSO Strategic Research and Innovation Agenda (SRIA)  December 2017  10  - Develop and implement cybersecurity solutions for the critical steps of trusted supply chains, in sectoral  applications where Europe is a leader15.  As part of the EU cybersecurity strategy, the European Commission and the ECSO signed a contractual private-public  partnership (cPPP)16 on 5 July 2016. The aim of the partnership is to foster cooperation between public and private  actors at early stages of the research and innovation process in order to allow people in Europe to access innovative  and trustworthy European ICT products and services. The cPPP can be regarded as a master plan in structuring and  coordinating digital security industrial resources in Europe. It includes a wide range of actors, from innovative SMEs  to producers of components and equipment, critical infrastructure operators and research institutes, brought  together under the umbrella of ECSO.  1.7.1 Security research and innovation agenda (Working group 6)  Within ECSO there are 6 working groups dealing with different topics:   WG1: Standardisation, certification, labelling and supply chain management   WG2: Market deployment, investments and international collaboration   WG3: Sectoral demand   WG4: Support to SMEs , coordination with countries (in particular East and Central EU) and regions   WG5: Education, awareness, training, exercises   WG6: Strategic Research and Innovation Agenda (SRIA)  Relevant to this paper is the working group 6, Strategic Research and Innovation Agenda (SRIA). The objectives of  this group are:   Coordination of results and expectations from European Commission and R&I projects   Coordination of cybersecurity activities across cPPPs and EU Initiatives   Support cPPP implementation and H2020 cybersecurity projects   Detailed suggestions for the Work Programme 2017-2020 using an updated and focused SRIA  ECSO – Security research and innovation agenda (SRIA WG 6)  1.8.1 Structure of the SRIA working group 6 publication17  There are seven priority areas identified in the Security Research and Innovation agenda, each of them broken down  to headings that analyse the given priority in detail. The technical projects are ment to deliver basic capabilities  (building blocks), on top of which both large cyber infrastructures (cross domains) and domain specific pilots can be  leveraged. The general structure of each heading includes a discussion of the specific challenge and a description of  the current status, including previous and ongoing projects in the fields. The market specifics and their European  relevance are also detailed, and the scope of research & innovation is suggested at each heading, followed by the  anticipated targeted users and the expected impact. A budget line is referred to each of the headings at the end of  each section, to be funded from the H2020 framework. Along the discussion of each heading, especially at the  challenge, status, and market descriptions, the current environment with special attention to market trends is  15 such as defence, automotive, and process industries, mechanical engineering, utilities (including utility equipment  vendors), telecom, and financial services  16 A cPPP is not specific for the cyber security industry. Any industry can set up a stakeholder interest group. The cPPP  is set up in the framework of the Horizon 2020 and is open to all organisations from the European Union and the  partnership countries. All eligible organisation can be beneficiaries of grant agreements for projects within the cPPP  irrespective of their affiliation.  17 http://www.ecs-org.eu/documents/publications/59e615c9dd8f1.pdf  Priorities for EU research  Analysis of the ECSO Strategic Research and Innovation Agenda (SRIA)  December 2017  11  detailed. References to the GDPR are common, as data protection and privacy regulations have an impact on most  priority headings. Relevance to the NIS Directive can also be found throughout the document, as the various priority  areas need to be operational in the regulatory and cooperation environment set by the directive.  1.8.2 Alignment of the ECSO SRIA priority areas with the GDPR and the NIS Directive  In terms of aligning the research objectives of the ECSO SRIA document with the GDPR, the primary remark regarding  the legislation is that it addresses the overall protection of European citizens and is therefore not sector-specific by  nature. The regulation does not reference cyber security, critical infrastructures, or any of the vertical sectors  defined in the SRIA document, however, provisions of the regulation must be applied in relation to the products and  services implemented as the result of the R&D activities. The GDPR employs a risk-based approach to data  protection. Organisations are encouraged to implement organisational and technical measures suitable for the  activities they engage in, following a risk assessment.  As for the NIS Directive, it specifies measures with a view to achieving a high common level of security of networks  and information systems within the EU so as to improve the functioning of the internal real and digital market. It  sets the baseline capabilities for each Member State to make sure they are well equipped to face cyber threats. In  addition, it aims at increasing EU-wide cooperation, both at strategic (Cooperation Group of national authorities)  and operational (CSIRT network) level and sets the requirements for notification of incidents. These provisions of  the directive mostly apply for the cyber transversal infrastructures, defined later in this document.  The following sections detail the areas of research work proposed by the SRIA document. The main sections are the  cyber Eco-system projects; the pilot projects for vertical application sectors, the cyber transversal infrastructures,  and the cyber technical projects. All these projects describe the priorities identified. Each priority includes  subsections of the key areas of research. (Annex II outlines the seven Strategic Research and Innovation Agenda  priorities.)  1.8.3 Ecosystem for Education, training, market growth and SME support  The Ecosystem for education, training, market growth and SME support requires an organised approach of  collaboration. Creating an operational (technological and human) eco-system is key to address the many issues that  contribute to an overall increase in the level of cyber-security. To address the challenge, the approach is to create a  continuum in terms of constituency – from users to solution providers and in terms of mechanisms – from need to  innovation and market.  Cyber Range and simulation are techniques that implement a wide number of complex scenarios and on-demand  countermeasures to address emerging cyber-risks. The cyber-range and simulation concepts are of relevance to all  stakeholders, regular users, professionals and experts to be able to adapt their expertise to a constantly evolving  attack landscape, a widening range of IT-impacted services, and changing regulations. The current challenge is to  extend the capabilities of cyber-ranges to user domain specificities, such as SCADA, ICS, mobile devices, health  related devices and IoT devices etc., to the integration or federation of solutions for different simulation  environments, to the development of tools to automate the preparation for large-scale simulation scenarios.  The existing simulation infrastructures are often government funded and operated, as well as defence focused, while  start-ups, universities, SMEs and large companies, critical infrastructure providers also need to have access to such  capabilities to reach the objective of higher competitiveness of European cybersecurity industry as well as a more  secure digital society in Europe. The EU provides an ideal opportunity for creating a world leading ecosystem for  simulation and cyber range platforms, given the common rules for digital society, data protection and business  environment, as well as a currently distributed cyber-security experience and actionable knowledge base. The scope  of the projects should focus on the piloting of networked cyber-ranges and the extension of the cyber-ranges  network. The impact will improve resilience of the ICT infrastructure, organise collaboration between a network of  cyber-ranges and Europe-wide initiatives such as the CSIRT network of the NIS Directive.  Priorities for EU research  Analysis of the ECSO Strategic Research and Innovation Agenda (SRIA)  December 2017  12  Security education and training needs to supply cybersecurity professionals and needs to provide a constant  learning process in a complex and fast-evolving field. There is a lack of suitable training and testing environments  available for the commercial sector to satisfy the needs for cybersecurity training and product testing. For example,  there are very few open ranges to involve more participants to the exercises, trainings, testing, experimenting, and  the existing ones focus on their specific needs.  The scope of the projects should focus on increasing the dynamics of the education and awareness methods, to  match the rate of evolution of cybercrime; and integrating awareness into the eco-system of people, competences,  services and solutions, that is able to rapidly adapt to the evolutions of cybercrime or even surpass them. The impact  will create better prepared professionals to emergent cyber-attacks, improve the resilience of infrastructures to  attacks, help to understand and to limit cybercriminal relationships.  Certification and standardisation of security products and services needs a unified position of Member States in  order to move towards the digital single market. There is no label, seal or certification scheme that is standard for  European security services and products. It is essential to promote the development of basic knowledge on  information security for users to raise awareness related to the risks posed by the use of products of unknown origin.  The challenge is to define a unified criterion for certification of cybersecurity products and services. This is a strong  demand to be reflected with the increase of the market size of IoT, intelligent cars and the overall role of IT across  all domains of our lives.18  The scope of the projects should focus on the development of mechanisms that ease the process of certification at  the level of services, designing solutions by defining and exercising metrics that should be related to a set of threat  models, and addressing the evolution of the level of certification with respect to the dynamicity of the deployed  environment.  Dedicated support to SMEs is designed towards SMEs as users and as solution providers. User SMEs need to be  supported in democratizing access to tools & solutions of varied sophistication level for SMEs to enable them also  to benefit from innovations and solutions that are currently reserved for larger organisations. As creators of  innovative solutions, provider SMEs need to be supported to access information and resources to better align their  innovation to needs and ease their validation. The support should include easing the piloting and field-testing to  foster a collaboration between SMEs, large providers and users and ease the delivery of joint competence. The  specific challenge therefore addresses the full value-chain for both provider and user SMEs. The scope of the Fast  Track and Full Access to Innovation projects should focus on the involvement of provider SMEs into cyber-ranges as  solution providers and ease their access to user environments, as well as increasing the level of cyber resilience of  user SMEs.  Another area of support for SMEs is to create a cybersecurity certification scheme for them, promoting a system of  “light” requirements for software/hardware/solution/system, enabling them to adapt their certification to the  actual environment/user context in which their solutions are deployed.  1.8.4 Demonstrations for the society, economy, industry and vital services:  Demonstrations for the society, economy, industry and vital services a description of the vertical sectors (application  domains) and their specific needs concerning cyber security.  Industry 4.0 is the current trend of automation and data exchange in manufacturing technologies. It includes cyber- physical systems (mainly ICS), the Internet of things and cloud computing, touching on the issues of digital  intelligence, smart sensing, advanced system modelling and machine learning technology, enabling enhanced  autonomy & efficiency of robotics. Projects addressing this topic should propose, design, validate and demonstrate  technological and organizational solutions enabling enhanced digitalization & modernization of existing and new  18 more details on the topic: https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/standards?tab=publications  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/standards?tab=publications  Priorities for EU research  Analysis of the ECSO Strategic Research and Innovation Agenda (SRIA)  December 2017  13  industries in Europe in a secure way. The challenges of the current approach to the security of ICS pose a number of  considerations relevant to GDPR and the NIS Directive. Innovation in the sector means a higher level of exposure,  adding new attack surfaces to the ICS environments19.  Privacy and confidentiality become a security issue with the requirements of the GDPR, while smart objects handle  a range of sensitive user data, service providers use Big Data solutions. The scope of R&D in the field should focus  on the secure and privacy-considerate transition of the manufacturing industry, and securing advanced  manufacturing labs. Information sharing mechanisms will support the implementation of the NIS Directive by  building horizontal, vertical and cross sector information exchanges, where the national CSIRTs and relevant  authorities play a coordinating role.  Energy: it is crucial for energy operators to ensure the safety and security of the whole interconnected energy chain,  from generation to supply as society relies completely on energy. Interconnected smart devices, such as sensors and  actuators, are widely deployed in households to measure energy use and reduce energy equipment consumption  and it is predicted that the number of these smart devices, known collectively as the Internet of Things, will amount  to several billion in the coming years. At the same time, energy infrastructures are increasingly exposed to cyber  threats due to the massive use of ICT and of new data interfaces and smart devices which offer new points of entry  to attackers20.  The energy systems could be structured around three main domains.  Smart Grids are the digitalization of electricity infrastructure and the transition from a closed, centralized, analogue  infrastructure to an open, largely decentralized, digital infrastructure, based on a highly interconnected ICT  infrastructure, allowing monitoring of the different components of the electric system. While smart grids take  substantial advantage of this new ICT infrastructure, they become at the same time more vulnerable as they are  now exposed to communication networks and computer application cyber-attacks which could cause serious  damage to the electricity network, as well as impacting the integrity and confidentiality of customers’ data.  Distributed Energy Resources (DER) are small-scale power generation sources located close to where electricity is  used (e.g., a home or business). They provide an alternative to or an enhancement of the traditional electric power  grid. The DER represent an important part of the whole electricity generation due to their massive integration in the  grid. Attacks targeting a large number of renewable energy sources (e.g. windfarms) could have a severe impact on  the smart grid and thus on electricity supply.  Centralized electricity generation plants with a significantly long lifespan, are now introducing the use of new ICT  technologies. Legacy systems have constrained resources and sometimes rely on old software that cannot always  be changed. As safety is a major requirement of these infrastructures, security solutions have to mitigate security  threats which can have an impact on safety, while potential interdependencies between security systems and safety  systems need to be managed. Due to the use of new technologies such as IoT, privacy issues have to be addressed  and solutions proposed.  The scope of research in the field should address control and management of cascading effects in power grids to  avoid major supply disruptions, control and management of increased cyber threats over time in the context of the  digitalization path of the energy system, and advanced access control schemes (logical and physical) for strategic  energy facilities.  The GDPR impacts the energy sector by providing guidelines for dealing with privacy and data  protection issues when using smart devices and IoT. Privacy-by-design should use appropriate technical safeguards  e.g. encryption and pseudononymisation that provide the expected level of data protection of the customers.  19 more details on the topic: https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/critical-information-infrastructures-and- services/scada?tab=publications  20 more details on the topic: https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/critical-information-infrastructures-and- services/smart-grids?tab=publications  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/critical-information-infrastructures-and-services/scada?tab=publications https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/critical-information-infrastructures-and-services/scada?tab=publications https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/critical-information-infrastructures-and-services/smart-grids?tab=publications https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/critical-information-infrastructures-and-services/smart-grids?tab=publications  Priorities for EU research  Analysis of the ECSO Strategic Research and Innovation Agenda (SRIA)  December 2017  14  According to the NIS Directive, Member States are requested to identify the operators of essential services and the  energy providers fall under this provision. As such, the specific energy subsector need to address the common threat  and risk landscape and be able to react to unexpected events. The NIS Directive addresses this issue by implementing  national CSIRTs and establishing reporting and information exchange capabilities between CSIRTs and the essential  service providers. Establishment of CSIRTs specializing in the energy domain (i.e. ICS-CSIRTs) are beyond the scope  of the cPPP, and must be handled at the Member State level. Specific actions for the energy operators are to  implement crisis management frameworks, supply chain integrity frameworks, awareness raising frameworks and  information sharing mechanisms that are independent of the research areas and must be applied to the energy  sector in general.  Smart Buildings & Smart Cities reflect an urban development vision to integrate ICT and IoT technologies in a secure  way to manage a city's interconnected assets, such as the information systems of local departments, schools,  libraries, transportation systems, hospitals, power plants, water supply networks, waste management, law  enforcement, and other community services. Like any other ICT system, the smart city’s technological and  communication environment is vulnerable to cyber-attacks and a large amount of data is at stake. The main aim of  smart cities technologies is to make cities data-driven; allowing city systems and services to be responsive and act  upon data in real-time. Innovation and research should focus on the simulation and detection of the additional  security threats created through the inter-connection of smart systems, the delivery of a cyber-security framework  to ease the collaboration across all smart cities stakeholders, from urban planners to infrastructure operators, IT  supervisors and providers across organisations, and implementing a common approach to securing and managing  the data from all the systems of a smart city / smart building – supporting both the citizen and the public authorities  in creating transparent, efficient and accountable cyber-secure data handling processes.21  As smart cities & buildings are data driven, organizational implications of the GDPR will be a major challenge with all  the obligations imposed on data processors and controllers. A network of data protection officers will have to be  trained, data security programs and processes, including privacy notices and information disclosure statements have  to be documented. On the technical side, the city's critical assets need to be segmented, a common approach of  privacy-by-design should be adopted to limit insecure products and data leakage.  In terms of alignment with the NIS Directive, smart cities need to focus on governance. A strategy with oversight and  organization over a city's cyber preparedness, especially in terms of cross-function vulnerability assessment and  incident response planning should work out mechanisms for information sharing, both horizontal and vertical.  Certification mechanisms will ensure interconnected devices meet standardized requirements, thus building more  resilient networks and information systems.  Transportation covers all security aspects of transport systems (people and freight) whose compromise, as a result  of coordinated attacks, may have serious impact at national and/or European level (e.g. cyber-physical attack  accompanied by a large-scale terrorist attack). Transportation covers four areas: unmanned aerial vehicles, smart  cars and trucks and road-side infrastructure, maritime units and their infrastructure, and the railway system, all of  which exhibit specific challenges to security research. In terms of economic power, European Automotive industry  is currently leading innovation worldwide, European railway companies currently lead the world market, European  shipbuilding is the world leader in building complex ships.  - Vehicles are becoming another consumer smart device. This will require the ability to update the  cryptographic algorithms and, in general, any part of its software, to adapt to upcoming challenges (e.g.  revocation of cryptographic material and certificates, revising protocols and blacklisting, upgrading and  patching of software, etc.). Other challenges are related with Identity Management (identification of entities  and up-to-date certificates), misbehaviour detection (tampering on-board sensors) and privacy protection.  21 more details on the topic: https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/iot-and-smart-infrastructures/smart- cities?tab=publications  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/iot-and-smart-infrastructures/smart-cities?tab=publications https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/iot-and-smart-infrastructures/smart-cities?tab=publications  Priorities for EU research  Analysis of the ECSO Strategic Research and Innovation Agenda (SRIA)  December 2017  15  Pedestrians, vehicles and the infrastructure need to be able to trust each other. Cybersecurity attacks  targeting smart cars may have severe consequences through life-threatening accidents but also through  smart-car based or assisted terrorist attacks. Besides the societal impact, smart-car based cyberattacks pose  a severe economic threat since trucks cover 75% of the European domestic good transport.22  - Maritime Vessels (cargo or cruise ships) and their infrastructure at land (ports) are at the heart of the global  economy: 90% of the international trade of goods are transported overseas, within Europe approximately  60% of goods are carried by maritime transport. The maritime domain, including ports, faces cybersecurity  challenges that are similar to those affecting ICS based industries The increasing connectivity of smart port  systems, cargo tracking and cargo identification are increasingly subject to cyber security incidents resulting  from cyber-attacks.  - An unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) -  or drone - is an aircraft without a human pilot. UAVs may carry out  surveillance and response missions for border security, homeland security, and critical infrastructure  protection, but on the other hand may call for attention to accidental, malicious, or criminal misuses.  Interest in cyber-weapons embedded in defensive UAVs is growing, but there are a number of technical and  operational challenges to face. Projects addressing this topic should propose innovative security frameworks  to support the design of robust cost-effective Sentry UAVs, tailored to surveillance missions towards Rogue  UAVs.  Railway is considered as a safety critical application. The railway infrastructure is highly distributed per Member  State, the networks don't fulfil the usual cyber security requirements in terms of sustainability, protection and attack  detection. Some encryption protocols have already been standardized but their application is restricted to particular  ETCS interfaces. The lack of standardisation is a major impediment for the development of a cyber-secure signalling  system. Applied to the railways system, the main objective of the security system is to ensure high availability,  authentication and integrity of the railways system by preventing attacks or errors. In terms of aligning research  areas with the GDPR, special technical controls need to be developed in the transportation sector to meet the data  protection requirements and at the same time create state-of-the-art products. The focus of innovation and  investment should put more strength in lightweight cryptography for reliable and timely authentication of vehicles,  multimodal authentication schemes to identify and authenticate driver and other humans, tamperproof  communication protocols to avoid channel hijacking, privacy preserving authentication.  Transportation is regarded as a critical sector in many of the Member States. As such, there is special attention on  the sector constituents by the competent authorities as well as national or sectoral CSIRTs. If constituents of the  transportation industry will be designated as operators of essential service, mandatory information exchanges will  be applied to the essential service providers.  Standardization of various technology elements (e.g. communication,  data protection) in the course of the innovation activities also enhance the resilience of the transportation industry,  adding to the safety and security of the European citizens. Governance aspects of the NIS Directive will be fulfilled  by laying emphasis on business continuity of the transportation services.  Healthcare faces many security challenges, most of them common to any critical infrastructure. Major concerns in  the field of e-health are associated with the high privacy and confidentiality requirements of sensitive healthcare  data23. Cyber-attacks targeting the Health sector are on the rise. Lack of adequate IT spending by healthcare  organizations and lack of awareness about cybercrime have exposed the vulnerabilities of healthcare organizations.  The designated Operators of Essential Services under the healthcare sector within European Union fall under the  stringent rules of the NIS Directive, being considered one of the critical infrastructures in many of the Member  States. Pilot projects in the field should focus on existing e-Health services involving as many stakeholders as  22 more details on the topic: https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/iot-and-smart-infrastructures/smart- cars?tab=publications  23 more details on the topic: https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/critical-information-infrastructures-and- services/health?tab=publications  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/iot-and-smart-infrastructures/smart-cars?tab=publications https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/iot-and-smart-infrastructures/smart-cars?tab=publications https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/critical-information-infrastructures-and-services/health?tab=publications https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/critical-information-infrastructures-and-services/health?tab=publications  Priorities for EU research  Analysis of the ECSO Strategic Research and Innovation Agenda (SRIA)  December 2017  16  possible, including but not limited to patients, healthcare service providers, doctors and other professionals. The  integrity of healthcare data being distributed among these many actors should be one of the key research areas. The  e-Health service should involve interconnected systems and data transfer, mobile services, smart devices and data  analytics, digitalisation of all the healthcare levels, the development of Assisted Living systems, wearable devices,  IP-enabled medical devices.  Specific challenges include eHealth service resiliency against cyberattacks (especially in new technologies like  telemedicine, home care systems, remote monitoring, mHealth), prevention against data-leakage and loss of patient  data and identity theft. Systems availability and business continuity is another key component of eHealth. Privacy- by-design should be another focus area to ensure data security and integrity, especially in terms of big data  originating from clinical trials and healthcare digitalization. These challenges all align with the requirements set out  in the GDPR and the NIS Directive.  E-services for the public sector can provide a number of benefits to both citizens and businesses, including improved  data transparency and service availability, increased participation of citizenship in political affairs (e.g., e-voting),  more convenient contact with administrations and access to Public Services, reduced administrative burden and  operating costs to Governments. This is in line with EU’s open data policy, which is part of the Digital Agenda for  Europe, and that sees open data as a driver for innovation, growth and transparent governance. Specific needs to  achieve this status include privacy enhancing data handling tools and technologies that ensure confidentiality,  integrity and availability.  Governments are the largest data controllers and processors, so ensuring confidentiality, integrity and availability is  the primary challenge. Failing to do so can lead to political unrest and the lack of inclusion of citizens in the digital  society. The provisions of the GDPR and NIS Directive place a special responsibility on the Member States to deploy  seamless technical controls to protect the data of its citizens and businesses, as well as taking part in national and  international cooperation via the national CSIRTs and the competent authorities to enhance the resiliency of the  governmental infrastructures.  The financial sector is considered to be the backbone of the economic development and competitiveness of Europe.  The implementation of a Single Financial Market and the aim of strengthening Europe's cyber resilience will highlight  some of the risks and challenges in order to reach a Single European Digital Financial Market. The increasing number  and frequency of sophisticated cyber-attacks against the banking sector highlights the need to develop a cyber  security framework to protect the integrated financial market and to combat cyber fraud. This requires a  comprehensive approach against emerging risks that takes into account the rise of digital banking via new devices,  the developments of innovative solutions based upon a collaborative integration such as DLT and blockchain24 and  concerns over privacy and data protection issues.  To reach an appropriate and consistent level of risk mitigation, it is important to foster awareness through data and  information sharing, even to the extent of sharing common infrastructures and to implement awareness raising and  training programs to overcome the negligence of the human factor. The investment into cyber solutions in the  financial sector represents a huge opportunity to boost European economy, by overcoming the customer fear and  enhancing their trust in digital means. The financial sector is mentioned in both GDPR and the NIS Directive. Failure  to protect customer data can lead to unforeseen effects. Data protection by means of technical innovations should  focus on new methods of authentication and authorization, whereas the infrastructure protection should focus on  building resilience through information sharing and cyber crisis simulation. The financial sector is a critical  infrastructure and CSIRTs are already engaged with the traditional financial institutions, however, with the opening  24 more details on the topic: https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/critical-information-infrastructures-and- services/finance?tab=publications  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/critical-information-infrastructures-and-services/finance?tab=publications https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/critical-information-infrastructures-and-services/finance?tab=publications  Priorities for EU research  Analysis of the ECSO Strategic Research and Innovation Agenda (SRIA)  December 2017  17  of the financial market under the PSD2 Directive, the newcomer service providers also need to be involved in the  governance strategy of the financial sector.  Telco, media and content providers are closely related market sectors with great financial importance, mostly listed  among the critical sectors in Member States. Telco networks are a core component of the current and future digital  infrastructure, so ensuring their security and dependability is vital to the European and global economy. Europe has  a good reputation in both privacy protection and in reliable high-quality system management, which justifies for  hosting data and systems in Europe despite of relatively high labour costs. Telcos, ISPs and large hosting companies  are amongst the more sophisticated types of companies investing into cybersecurity as they are high profile, high  value targets for cyber attackers and the consequences of disrupting operations are highly visible and have  widespread impact. For this reason, the scope of innovation and investments are focused around the areas of mobile  and IoT security, detection of threats and illegal content, cloud services and platforms, network virtualisation,  encryption, and 5G networking technologies. Telco, media and content providers are likely to become operators of  essential services based on the NIS Directive, so their reporting obligations in terms of data breach and security  incidents will impact their daily business. With regard to the GDPR, these operators will have to lay special emphasis  on their activity as data processors and controllers, especially with the enhanced notice and information obligations  before collection and to adhere with the consent and ability to withdraw information.  1.8.5 Collaborative intelligence to manage cyber threats and risks  Cyber Transversal Infrastructure is a complex entity composed of elements utilising diverse technologies and owned  by different entities, including network operators, cloud service providers, national and local government agencies,  end user companies and private individuals. As the vertical elements depend critically on the digital infrastructure,  it must be highly resilient and trustworthy. The challenge is to secure that the infrastructures serving the applications  are resilient to attack, accident and error, and assure them of the trustworthiness of the infrastructure. There are  two complementary approaches to making a system more secure: the first is to harden the functional elements of  the system in order to make them more resistant to attack and/or failure; the second is to incorporate additional  security-specific components and processes into the system, which include protection, detection, response &  recovery and Governance, Risk and Compliance (GRC). These components apply to individual elements of the digital  infrastructure as a whole, and to the applications and organisations that depend on the infrastructure, incorporating  aspects of cooperation and coordination, both laterally and vertically.  Governance, Risk & Compliance: Security Assessment and Risk Management uses an integrated approach involving  people, processes and technology; the interrelationships between physical and logical security; and between safety  and cybersecurity. When managing risk in critical infrastructures or in cyber-physical systems, security, safety,  resilience and reliability properties and requirements should be concurrently viewed, consolidated and reconciled  in an integrated manner. At the same time, security risk management must be aligned and interlinked with  enterprise risk management and cost factors. Risk should be managed with respect to the assets, services and data  to be protected, and investment in security should be aligned with their value and the impact of their potential  malfunctions.  Risk management is a major catalyst for cyber security. The GDPR and NIS Directive will be driving forces for risk  management in Europe in the upcoming years, both are seen as important tools to drive adequate protection of  data. GRC is a tool that provides an integrated security view (logical, physical, safety, resilience, juridical,  organisational) holistically taking into account people, processes and technology in its analysis of potential threats  and vulnerabilities, their impact and potential countermeasures in order to enable strategic oversight of the  effectiveness of an organisation’s security processes. It synthesises a strategic picture using input from  tactical/operation security systems and process, and provides an organisation’s senior management with means of  assessing and improving its security posture. The output of the GRC should facilitate inter-organisational cooperation  and cooperation with supra-organisational institutions. This includes trusted information sharing mechanisms on  threats, vulnerabilities and incidents, perhaps on an industry basis, to help the creation and coordination of  Priorities for EU research  Analysis of the ECSO Strategic Research and Innovation Agenda (SRIA)  December 2017  18  preventive and corrective plans. Information sharing is mandated for operators of essential services by the NIS  Directive. Data based risk management approaches need to be part of the GRC solution, to achieve better  preparedness through the analysis of data fed from multiple domains (infrastructure, process, operations, and  observation) and multiple sources or even sectors to provide additional intelligence.25  Innovations in the area should address risk-based situation awareness, assessment and decision support, automated  assessment mechanisms, cyber risk governance, the use of cyber ranges, simulation & training, and the certification  of operators.  PROTECT: High-assurance prevention and protection against attacks in modern ICT components, infrastructure, and  systems remains a complex task, so there is justifiable need for the design, implementation, and verification of high- assurance components, systems, and infrastructures. Solutions for end-users also require high-assurance security as  they are considered a key security vulnerability. To achieve high-assurance, investments on cybersecurity initiatives  to protect PCs, mobile devices, and IoT devices will need to be increased. The scope of innovation and research  should cover means to protect digital infrastructures and the applications that use them by preventing cyber-attacks  on them being successful. Security, privacy and trust considerations should be involved from the very beginning in  the design of digital infrastructure, systems and processes. Trustworthiness should also cover secure execution  environments and systems.  By preparing the infrastructures to better resist advanced attacks and their consequences, protection capabilities  will target the users of ICT and ICS infrastructure. This will result in the increase of trustworthiness of European ICT  services and products and the competitiveness of the European industry.  DETECT: Information Sharing, Security Analytics, and Cyber-Threat Detection are advanced processes that enable  an organization to gather valuable insights based on the analysis of contextual and situational risks and can be  tailored to the specific threat landscape, its industry and markets. Intelligence driven detection can improve the  ability to anticipate breaches before they occur and respond quickly, decisively and effectively to confirmed  breaches. SIEMs and SOCs are currently struggling with the challenge of integrating multiple sources of data,  including a multitude of ICT and ICS systems on one side and diverse threat information data on the other side. So  they need more intelligent and effective approaches for integrating and using the mass of data available. It is  essential to establish how information should be shared and which level of abstraction is effective. The analysis  should be done across different information sources both unstructured (textual content and multimedia) and  structured ones, and for this natural language analysis must be taken into account. Machine learning technologies  could be helpful in obtaining Cyber Security Intelligence from the Dark/Deep Web. The sharing of security  information requires trust mechanisms among the entities involved in sharing their data. A common, normalised  terminology and framework is important in facilitating sharing of information and reducing response and processing  times.26  Proposals on this subtopic need to target the improvement of detection and analysis of cyber-threats at a system,  network meta-system and process level, based on a combination of existing and new techniques. Specific  developments may target challenging environments like ICS/SCADA, mobility & cloud, IoT, virtualized networks or  embedded systems. The complementarity between end-point and network detection capabilities should be  enhanced, and scalability to big data should also be enabled. A native European threat intelligence feed should be  established, and a mechanism created for distributing this information effectively among the stakeholders,  especially operators of critical infrastructures as defined by the NIS Directive.  RESPONSE and RECOVERY: Cyber threat management is concerned with planning and executing appropriate actions  following the detection of a security event, and restoring the system to ‘business as usual’ status. Digital Forensics  25 more details on the topic: https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/threat-risk-management?tab=publications  26 more details on the topic: https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/national-cyber-security-strategies/information- sharing?tab=publications  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/threat-risk-management?tab=publications https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/national-cyber-security-strategies/information-sharing?tab=publications https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/national-cyber-security-strategies/information-sharing?tab=publications  Priorities for EU research  Analysis of the ECSO Strategic Research and Innovation Agenda (SRIA)  December 2017  19  and Attack Attribution are important associated activities that play key roles in improving security technologies,  controls, and postures of attacked entities, and in legal investigation of cybercrime cases. Response and Recovery  capabilities are required essentially for any entity targeted by cyberattacks, that is, almost anyone possessing  financial assets, IP assets, personal data, or sometimes just computational resources. Examples are operators of  critical infrastructures, organizations in such domains as defence, law enforcement, and gaming and gambling, but  also SME’s and other smaller organizations with their specific constraints. The main objective is to validate and  demonstrate an integrated security infrastructure supporting the Respond and Recover processes that are  appropriate to the technical, business and threat environment that is prevalent in the year 2020.  Proven and standardized techniques and practices of security log management, incident reporting, cost-based  Response and Recovery decision-making, and incident information sharing will also enable more effective and timely  cooperation in resolving incidents and higher preparedness of the users to dealing with incidents and their  consequences. The technological and operational enablers of cooperation in Response and Recovery will contribute  to the development of the CSIRT Network, which is one of the key targets of the NIS Directive.27  1.8.6 Remove trust barriers for data-driven applications and services  Data security and privacy is a very wide field. Europe has traditionally been very conscious about protecting user  privacy. In this aspect, it has developed the technical expertise to lead the area of data protection and it has  developed the political will that can help push innovative solutions into the market. As an impact, it is expected that  companies will turn to solutions that ensure better data protection and better privacy for the end users. The scope  of innovations in the topic will create secure and privacy aware data processing and storage, balance privacy needs  and business demands, and facilitate the implementation of the regulatory context (e.g. the GDPR).28  ID and Distributed trust management (including Distributed Ledger technology) refers to the future of  authentication/authorization. Europe has successfully invested into distributed identity and trust management and  enjoys a better reputation for decentralized and privacy-friendly services than several other areas. The need for  distributed trust management combined with the need for privacy may lead to significant innovation in the market.  As an impact of the innovations in the field, flexible authentication and authorisation schemes will come to existence,  authentication will operate in a distributed fashion without single points of failure on critical paths, distributed trust  management frameworks will be largely adopted. This impact will satisfy the ambitions of the GDPR in terms of  enhancing data protection, and the NIS Directive in building more resilient information systems.29  User centric security and privacy solutions aim at guaranteeing the privacy and security of citizen’s data. Identity  protection and privacy are topics of general interest for different markets since they are transversal to several areas  and can be used for digital services. European companies need to protect their customers’ personal information and  respect the emerging data privacy regulation, while at the same time enabling their usage in smarter and more  secure digital services and giving the right visibility and control to the user. The challenge of adapting authentication  to the conditions of the environment or the critical level of the operation being performed by the user is a key issue  for service providers, invoked by the GDPR or the Privacy-by-design provisions of the eIDAS regulation. Investment  in the area should result in increased awareness in privacy leading to a decrease of identity theft, new best practices  and usable technologies in authentication for both digital service providers and end users that enable user-centric  security and privacy.  1.8.7 Maintain a secure and trusted infrastructure in the long-term  ICT infrastructure protection is one of the most challenging dimensions of cyber security, considering the speed and  scope of cyber-attacks or incidents. The increased interconnections created within the Internet as well as between  27 more details on the topic: https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/csirt-cert-services?tab=publications  28 more details on the topic: https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/data-protection/security-of-personal- data?tab=publications  29 more details on the topic: https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/blockchain-security  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/csirt-cert-services?tab=publications https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/data-protection/security-of-personal-data?tab=publications https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/data-protection/security-of-personal-data?tab=publications https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/blockchain-security  Priorities for EU research  Analysis of the ECSO Strategic Research and Innovation Agenda (SRIA)  December 2017  20  the Internet and the internal communication networks of critical infrastructures have made our society vulnerable  to attacks that spread across hundreds of thousands of computers, mobile devices or even intelligent connected  objects. In addition, the ICT infrastructure has become increasingly flexible, scalable and open.  Member States must be in control of their state-based critical networks, systems and platforms, and must be able  to protect them from threats. Otherwise, the risk is high that citizens become reluctant to use these services. Privacy  remains a key issue that can only be supported if the entire architecture of ICT services is considered secure, safe  and resilient to threats. Given the expected impact of the density of devices and users in the infrastructures,  virtualization of the resources in the infrastructures seems the more sustainable option that need to deal with  security and scalability problems among others. Research with particular interest in ICT infrastructure protection  focuses on services; cloud infrastructures, including all the computing, networking and data components; and  trusted networking infrastructures and virtualization. The scope of innovations should focus on areas of threat  management, network security, protocol transition / migration to secure systems, secure execution environment,  and device and system security. The impact of the innovations will result in a higher security level of infrastructures,  supporting the implementation of the NIS directive.30  Quantum resistant cryptography aims to solve the emerging threat that large-scale quantum computers will be able  to break current standard asymmetric cryptographic algorithms in a matter of hours. As cryptographic functionality  is a core component for cybersecurity, this will have serious implications, in particular to medical data and data in  classified systems related to national security. In addition, the number of IoT devices will grow significantly in the  next decade, so the development of software, hardware, and key management technologies is core to address the  emerging threat.  The scope of research should focus on quantum-safe cryptographic methods and algorithms for both asymmetric  and symmetric cryptography, transition from present-day cryptographic systems to quantum-resistant  cryptography, and developing evaluation criteria for quantum-resistant public key cryptographic standards and  implementations.  1.8.8 Intelligent approaches to eliminate security vulnerabilities in systems, services and applications  Trusted supply chain for resilient systems focuses on trust and dependency on consumed Cloud Services from third  parties. There are many solutions developed to ensure not only the security and dependability aspects but also the  data protection and privacy provisions of the Cloud Service Providers. Industry advocates cloud SLAs for  transparency and applied security controls, but the lack of models, mechanisms and tools for supporting dynamicity  in SLAs is still a challenge. Evidence based Cloud certification is a new approach to be explored.  The Digital Single Market will require collaboration and open innovation from stakeholders to create competitive  added value. An average single company in Europe (i.e. SMEs) can hardly address the whole service supply chain by  their own in the environment of IoT, inter-cloud environments, Industry 4.0, etc. The scope of innovations should  focus on methods for developing resilient systems out of potentially insecure components, their certification and  security assurance methodologies, enhancing open source security. The impact will be increased trust along the  supply chain, with solutions for certified systems instead of certified components.  Security-by-design is the concept that software and hardware must be designed with privacy and security in mind  from planning to implementation. This best practice is already mandatory in certain industries especially those  involved in embedded, industrial, technical and scientific software like defence, aerospace, energy, hi-tech and  spreading to telecom and finance. Europe enjoys a high reputation for Privacy and Security-by-Design, as enforced  by the GDPR and the Privacy-by-design provisions of the eIDAS regulation. The scope of developments should focus  on methods and tools for developing privacy enhancing and secure software and hardware, security and privacy  30 more details on the topic: https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/critical-information-infrastructures-and- services/internet-infrastructure?tab=publications  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/critical-information-infrastructures-and-services/internet-infrastructure?tab=publications https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/critical-information-infrastructures-and-services/internet-infrastructure?tab=publications  Priorities for EU research  Analysis of the ECSO Strategic Research and Innovation Agenda (SRIA)  December 2017  21  INDUSTRY 4.0 ENERGY TRANSPORT EHEALTH  SMART  CITIES &  BUILDINGS  EPUBLIC  SERVICES  FINANCE  TELCO/ISP/ CONTENT  PROVIDERS  IoT/IP enabled  devices  x  x  Access and Identity  management  x  x x x  Cloud based  infrastructure/SDN/N FV  x  x  x  Big Data / data  science  x  x x  Authorization/Authen tication  x  x x x  x x  Automation/Robotics x  Privacy/Data  Protection  x x x x x x x x  Cryptograpy/encrypti on  x  x  x  Embedded systems x  x x x x  Tamperproof  communication  protocols  x x x x x x x x  Navigation systems  x  Anonymization/pseud onynamization  x  x  x  Machine learning/AI x x  x  Cyber crisis  simulation  x  Cross domain sensing  and analysis  x  x  Cascading effects of  disruptions  x x x  x  x  Risk and impact on  human health and  safety  x  x  Priorities for EU research  Analysis of the ECSO Strategic Research and Innovation Agenda (SRIA)  December 2017  22  architectures, and secure deployment. Impacted beneficiaries will be software developers and suppliers within  vertical market segments, as well as the security consumers and the end-users by measurable improved security and  privacy levels and efficiency gain and increased trust both by developers using the components and by end-users.31  1.8.9 From security components to security services  Advanced Security Services focuses on the processes required to provide, manage, measure, certify, restore, etc.  privacy and security, and the tools required to support them. Any entity, from individuals to large enterprises and  governments, has a need of cybersecurity functions of certain types. Most common services include consulting and  IT outsourcing, managed security services, managed detection and response. The cybersecurity services market is at  the moment led by North American players, however, the availability of cybersecurity services from European  providers is often of high importance due to such matters as trust, requirements of laws and regulations, existing  business relationships, subtle cultural aspects, etc. To stay globally competitive, the European cybersecurity industry  must aim at leading positions in delivering comprehensive services to end-customers and avoid the confines of the  technology provider role. Projects should address technology-, process-, and business-related aspects of building  and running cybersecurity services, including approaches to service quality assessment to support customers in their  service and provider selection efforts. SLA models are important business ingredients of cybersecurity services,  influenced by the choices of security tools and technologies, platforms for integrating those and delivering services  to the customers, and expertise of the service provider’s personnel. The efforts should support the implementation  of the NIS Directive in enabling and shaping collaboration between service providers, CSIRTs, and other relevant  organizations.  Impact analysis of the R&D proposals in the context of the GDPR and the NIS  Directive  The objective of this document is to provide an analysis of areas covered by the NIS Directive and the GDPR where  R&D activities would achieve the greatest impact. The ECSO SRIA document proposes a complex system for areas of  research, which allows to suggest concrete areas for funding with rationale for their choice. The impact analysis  maps the cyber security related research needs of the vertical sectors (application domains), and makes an  assumption on the priority of research topics based on their reusability, and their importance in the security/privacy- by-design concept.  Table 2 The vertical domains and their anticipated fields of research  Table 2 provides an overview of each sector in terms of their technological needs. By the description of each sector  given in the section above, the following assumptions can be made:  31 more details on the topic: https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/data-protection/privacy-by- design?tab=publications  Cyber risk modelling  and management  x  x x  Awareness and  incident response  x x  Vulnerability testing x  x  x  Cyber insurance  x  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/data-protection/privacy-by-design?tab=publications https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/data-protection/privacy-by-design?tab=publications  Priorities for EU research  Analysis of the ECSO Strategic Research and Innovation Agenda (SRIA)  December 2017  23  - The prime area of interest by the vertical sectors in terms of R&D activities is privacy/data protection. This  is a broad topic that can be broken down to technological components. Most of the topics in the matrix can  be regarded as enablers of better privacy/data protection solutions.  - By selecting more specific areas of R&D, secure communication protocols and authentication/authorization  methods seem to be the common interest for the verticals. Both topics can be regarded as technical  safeguards that will ensure more resilient infrastructures and information systems, thus adhering to the  measures of the GDPR and the NIS Directive.  - The matrix also shows that the Industry 4.0 and the eHealth sector seem to be the most research-intensive  sectors.  - An interesting observation is that cyber crisis simulation and the research of cascading effects also exhibit  an outstanding area to be explored aside the technical related topics.  The impact analysis further maps the cyber security related research fields in Table 3 based on the needs of the  cyber transversal infrastructures. Contrary to the vertical sectors, the transversals focus their research needs more  on trust and resiliency, as the stakeholders represent a horizontal cross section of the digital society. The areas of  interest support in the implementation of the NIS Directive. The table below indicates that the main interest in all  transversals is in usable and actionable information on threats, whereas high-assurance prevention and protection  requires the biggest number of security components.

The NIS  Directive puts emphasis on cooperation and collaboration on national and international level, so strengthening these  beneficiaries with the implementation of the innovation and research results will enhance European cyber security  resiliency, as well as raise the European competitiveness on the global cyber security market.  Both vertical sectors and transversal infrastructures define their needs in terms technical research. To address these  needs, the ECSO SRIA document defines the scopes of cyber technical projects with a given set of themes and  technical topics. By conducting research in the given topic, its product can be used in either the verticals or the  transversals. The scope of the cyber technical projects is listed below with the anticipated topics of research.  - Remove trust barriers for data-driven applications and services: authentication, AIM, privacy, encryption;  - Maintain a secure and trusted infrastructure in the long-term: awareness raising, threat intelligence and  management, network security and secure environments, cryptography;  - Intelligent approaches to eliminate security vulnerabilities in systems, services and applications:  certification, open source security, privacy-by-design;  - From security components to security services: security analysis, security monitoring and management,  incident response, forensics, threat intelligence, certification.  The outcome of the research projects will be the building blocks for the vertical sectors and transversal  infrastructures from which they can leverage their respective needs.  Importance and alignment with global trends in cyber security  The ECSO SRIA makes suggestions to research and innovation in the context of the global cyber security landscape.  In 2016, the EU Cyber Security Market was estimated at €20.1bn and compares favourably with the cybersecurity  market of other global regions. The CAGR of the EU market however is 6%, whereas the average growth rate is  around 8%, and is growing slower than all other major regions32, so Europe needs extra effort to catch up with the  global trend. The document identifies the current characteristics of the European market that inhibit leadership as  listed below:  - Europe’s share of the global economy is declining due to slower growth.  - The EU market is fragmented in practice, making growth difficult.  - Funding shortages and entrepreneurial support.  - Europe procurement policies focus too much on short-term savings without promoting customer-vendor  partnerships needed for innovation.  - Less investment in R&D and little market success.  - Skills shortages.  - European companies favour execution over strategic vision.  32 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/enisa-position-papers-and-opinions/cybersecurity-as-an-economic- enabler, p1  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/enisa-position-papers-and-opinions/cybersecurity-as-an-economic-enabler https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/enisa-position-papers-and-opinions/cybersecurity-as-an-economic-enabler  Priorities for EU research  Analysis of the ECSO Strategic Research and Innovation Agenda (SRIA)  December 2017  25  On the other hand, however, Europe places special emphasis on safeguarding its citizens and securing its  infrastructure, by means of the overarching legislations, such as the GDPR and the NIS Directive, to reach toward a  sustainable Digital Single Market. The objective of the cPPP is to bridge the gap between capacity building and the  deployment of trusted European cyber security solutions on European and international markets. To address the  global trends and to overcome the current European gaps, there need to be coordinated cyber security actions  within the EU that call for the swift implementation of cyber security strategies at the EU, national, and regional  levels and the promotion of European cyber security and privacy research and innovation. Parallel to this activity,  there is a need for a more active outreach to the world-wide research communities to promote international cyber  security and privacy research and innovation activities.  Priorities for EU research  Analysis of the ECSO Strategic Research and Innovation Agenda (SRIA)  December 2017  26  2. Conclusions  Cybersecurity is an essential enabling factor for the development and exploitation of digital technologies and  innovation and is, therefore, linked to future prospects for growth, job creation and Europe’s response to  environmental and societal goals. Specifically, Europe’s ambitions to develop or reinforce its leadership in key  economic areas (e.g. health, energy, transport, finance, Industry 4.0, communications and public services) must be  supported by cybersecurity solutions that meet the needs of emerging digital markets.  The ECSO SRIA report highlights the potential topics for research and innovation related to cyber security for the  H2020 Work Programme that fosters the consolidation and growth of the European cyber security market and  industry. It describes the recommended topics for the H2020 calls in the format for the H2020 calls, i.e. specific  challenge, scope, expected impact, topic budget and time planned for the call. In addition, further reasoning is  included on how to better motivate the choice of the suggested topics, including the market, the rationale for  covering the specific areas at European level, the target users and other elements. The document in itself also refers  to the currently dominant EU legislations and guidelines that need to be adhered to, specifically the GDPR, the NIS  Directive, the eIDAS or the Digital Agenda.  According to the ECSO SRIA, the success factor to meet the overall objectives are the capabilities and competences  of the human resources involved within the process and the ability of all the involved stakeholders to collaborate  and cooperate across public and private organisations, Member States and at international level. The ECSO proposes  a contractual public-private partnership (cPPP) to address the main strategic objectives to be achieved, which are:  - The protection from cyber threats of the growth of the European Digital Single Market;  - The creation of a strong European-based offering and an equal level playing field to meet the needs of the  emerging digital market with trustworthy and privacy aware solutions;  - The growth and the presence of Europe’s cybersecurity industry in the global market.  Although the ECSO SRIA sets the objectives for the cPPP, its focus remains on the context of the H2020, and it will  not be able to solve policy activities and research and innovation funding that goes parallel or beyond H2020. There  are gaps remaining, especially with the alignment of the European regulatory framework, namely the GDPR and the  NIS Directive.  Gaps in EU legislation  The GDPR addresses the overall protection of European citizens and is therefore not sector-specific by nature. The  regulation does not reference cyber security, critical infrastructures, or any of the vertical sectors defined in the SRIA  document, however, provisions of the regulation must be applied in the process of personal data collection and  usage. The GDPR aims to encourage innovation, as long as organizations implement the appropriate safeguards. The  regulation adopts a “broad” definition of research, encompassing the activities of both public and private entities.  However, it remains unclear whether research for product improvement, corporate beta-testing or market research  purposes would be considered scientific research. This important interpretative question is likely to be taken up by  data protection authorities and advisory bodies. In the age of big data, where the data analytics activities of many  organizations may qualify as research, it is unclear exactly how far the GDPR’s research exemption will extend.  Involvement of legal expertise will be crucial as the regulation does not provide exact definitions that can be applied  out of the box.  The NIS Directive specifies measures with a view to achieving a high common level of security of networks and  information systems within the EU to improve the functioning of the internal real and digital market. It sets the  Priorities for EU research  Analysis of the ECSO Strategic Research and Innovation Agenda (SRIA)  December 2017  27  baseline capabilities for each Member State, however many of the definitions of these capabilities still remain open  in the context of set-up, methodology or content. While the priority areas are set by the ECSO SRIA, the  implementation of research and innovation will only be successful if the regulatory environment will have a common  definition and implementation of the provisions under the NIS Directive. By way of examples33:  - A common European threat and risk landscape to understand and address the threat and risks, inclusive of  all vertical domains is still missing.  - The information sharing on threats, risks and vulnerabilities is not well defined and lacks a common  classification scheme applicable to the vertical domains.  - The harmonization of criteria for the identification of operators of essential services is not available.  - A EU-wide accepted cyber response framework is missing that should include the necessary processes in  case of cyber attacks.  - A minimum level of maturity has to be agreed when a maturity framework is available.  - The harmonization of security implementation across the European Union is not sufficiently addressed.  - A supply chain and integrity framework is not available as of the date of writing.  - There are no common incident reporting criteria defined that the vertical sectors can refer to.  - The cooperation with EU and Non-EU countries and international organisations is not or only partially  defined.  - Crisis management frameworks do not address cyber security incidents and attacks for all vertical domains.  Alignment with previous Strategic Research Agenda  Identification and prioritising of forthcoming research and innovation topics should be performed in close  collaboration with industrial stakeholders across Europe towards a more focused and coordinated approach. In the  previous years, the European Network and Information Security (NIS) Platform was the vehicle where the key  challenges and desired outcomes in terms of innovation-focused, basic and applied research in the fields of cyber  security, privacy, and trust were identified. As an outcome of the NIS Platform's work, a Strategic Research Agenda  (SRA)34 was published, that outlines the key objectives of the desired research priorities as follows:  - Fostering assurance  - Focussing on data  - Enabling secure execution  - Preserving privacy  - Increasing trust  - Managing cyber risks  - Protecting ICT infrastructures  - Achieving user-centricity  The Digital Single Market strategy together with Horizon 2020 introduced the concept of cPPP that will focus on  Research and Innovation but also go beyond and address measures that can help impose connection to end users,  improve the reporting of validation activities with users of research results and promote participation of relevant EU  Industry. In case of cyber security, this is realized by the ECSO, and the SRIA document clearly follows the key  33 https://ec.europa.eu/energy/sites/ener/files/documents/eecsp_report_final.pdf  34 https://resilience.enisa.europa.eu/nis-platform/shared-documents/wg3-documents/strategic-research-agenda- final-v0.96/at_download/file  https://ec.europa.eu/energy/sites/ener/files/documents/eecsp_report_final.pdf https://resilience.enisa.europa.eu/nis-platform/shared-documents/wg3-documents/strategic-research-agenda-final-v0.96/at_download/file https://resilience.enisa.europa.eu/nis-platform/shared-documents/wg3-documents/strategic-research-agenda-final-v0.96/at_download/file  Priorities for EU research  Analysis of the ECSO Strategic Research and Innovation Agenda (SRIA)  December 2017  28  objectives of the SRA document of the NIS Platform. In terms of the fields covered among the focus areas of the  SRIA, it can be stated with high confidence that the complementary projects proposed will cover all aspects of cyber  security. The cyber security eco-system will create the baseline capabilities, the cyber pilots will address various  vertical sector-specific needs, the cyber transversal infrastructures will enhance the cooperation requirements of  the determinant EU cyber legislations, and the technical projects will provide the innovative technical solutions, as  building blocks, for vertical domains and the transversal infrastructures.  Governance and promotion  When discussing the potential research areas that are designed to lead or regain European competitiveness in the  cyber security market, the concept of governance needs to be taken into consideration. This is a task that goes  beyond the scope of ECSO and their research proposal. However, the governance of ECSO provides some insight on  how the organisation approaches involvement in research. The Bylaws of ECSO35 sets the roles and responsibilities  of its members and governing bodies, with special attention to the cPPP. The cPPP encompasses a Partnership Board  (PB), which comprises of ECSO and EC representatives. The main objective of the Board is to discuss the annual  priorities of the Horizon 2020 Cybersecurity Work Program, the implementation of the overall R&D program related  topics and the monitoring of the cPPP commitments. The ESCO representatives to the PB undertake not to influence  the implementation of the H2020 programme, or be involved in the preparation or evaluation of related calls. This  should limit any conflict of interest from ECSO’s behalf.  Furthermore, the ECSO recommends the formation of a European Cybersecurity Council, which would be a high level  advisory body not belonging to the ECSO but closely linked to it. A European Cybersecurity Council would assess at  a high level the work of the cPPP as well as provide the ECSO Board and the cPPP Partnership Board with guidelines  and commitment for a longer term strategy. It would be composed by relevant CEOs/executive decision makers  from Association Members, members of the European Parliament and of National Authorities as well as the relevant  Commissioners and high-level representative from the European Institutions. The European Cybersecurity Council is  yet to be established.  Areas not covered by the ECSO SRIA  In terms of gaps or uncovered areas, it is important to bear in mind that the ECSO was established to foster cyber  security R&D within the H2020 framework. There are some areas, e.g. national security, defence, nuclear energy,  aviation, online content development, online child protection, or general awareness raising that do not fit in the  context of H2020, therefore the ECSO SRIA does not take this into consideration. However, through other funding  schemes (as listed in previous section) the EU provides mechanisms to fill these gaps to ensure that all cyber related  societal challenges are addressed. Promotion and dissemination of R&D results falls out of the scope of ECSO, thus  it is not covered by the SRIA document. By nature, all research projects plan with dissemination activities, but the  SRIA does not include any overarching promotion and dissemination plan to position ECSO as a technology transfer  or research brokerage platform in the EU R&D landscape. These activities are to be carried out in other existing  mechanisms, such as CORDIS36.  What is already in place  Regardless of the cPPP between ECSO and the EC, H2020 is ongoing with its calls in the digital security focus area.  Up to date, seven calls in digital security have been published, and two calls are open at the time of writing. Three  calls were specifically addressing the cPPP for proposals. The areas of focus for the cyber security related calls are:  - Assurance and Certification for Trustworthy and Secure ICT systems, services and components;  35 http://www.ecs-org.eu/documents/uploads/591d55b9be0a6.pdf  36 Community Research and Development Information Service, http://cordis.europa.eu/guidance/home_en.html  http://www.ecs-org.eu/documents/uploads/591d55b9be0a6.pdf http://cordis.europa.eu/guidance/home_en.html  Priorities for EU research  Analysis of the ECSO Strategic Research and Innovation Agenda (SRIA)  December 2017  29  - Cyber Security for SMEs, local public administration and Individuals;  - Increasing digital security of health-related data on a systemic level;  - Economics of Cybersecurity;  - EU Cooperation and International Dialogues in Cybersecurity and Privacy Research and Innovation;  - Cybersecurity PPP: Cryptography;  - Cybersecurity PPP: Addressing Advanced Cyber Security Threats and Threat Actors;  - Cybersecurity PPP: Privacy, Data Protection, Digital Identities.37  Preceding H2020, a number of initiatives and cooperation mechanisms have been started in the field of critical  information infrastructure protection and combatting cybercrime. There are a number of existing national and EU- wide information exchange mechanisms38, mainly being formed on a voluntary basis. Most Member States have  national/governmental CSIRTs that cooperate with each other and with various critical sectors. There are  European agencies, such as Europol or ENISA that foster multilateral cooperation in the field of information  security and combatting cybercrime. The number of best practices built up over the past ten years led to the  considerations laid down in the NIS Directive. All this provides a firm background to the current and future  implementation of research activities carried out in the context of the ECSO SRIA.  37 https://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/portal/desktop/en/opportunities/h2020/calls/h2020-ds-2016- 2017.html#c,topics=callIdentifier/t/H2020-DS-2016-2017/1/1/1/default- group&callStatus/t/Forthcoming/1/1/0/default-group&callStatus/t/Open/1/1/0/default- group&callStatus/t/Closed/1/1/0/default-group&+identifier/desc (opened on 15 August 2017)  38 more details on the topic: https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/cross-cooperation-for-csirts  https://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/portal/desktop/en/opportunities/h2020/calls/h2020-ds-2016-2017.html#c,topics=callIdentifier/t/H2020-DS-2016-2017/1/1/1/default-group&callStatus/t/Forthcoming/1/1/0/default-group&callStatus/t/Open/1/1/0/default-group&callStatus/t/Closed/1/1/0/default-group&+identifier/desc (opened on 15 https://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/portal/desktop/en/opportunities/h2020/calls/h2020-ds-2016-2017.html#c,topics=callIdentifier/t/H2020-DS-2016-2017/1/1/1/default-group&callStatus/t/Forthcoming/1/1/0/default-group&callStatus/t/Open/1/1/0/default-group&callStatus/t/Closed/1/1/0/default-group&+identifier/desc (opened on 15 https://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/portal/desktop/en/opportunities/h2020/calls/h2020-ds-2016-2017.html#c,topics=callIdentifier/t/H2020-DS-2016-2017/1/1/1/default-group&callStatus/t/Forthcoming/1/1/0/default-group&callStatus/t/Open/1/1/0/default-group&callStatus/t/Closed/1/1/0/default-group&+identifier/desc (opened on 15 https://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/portal/desktop/en/opportunities/h2020/calls/h2020-ds-2016-2017.html#c,topics=callIdentifier/t/H2020-DS-2016-2017/1/1/1/default-group&callStatus/t/Forthcoming/1/1/0/default-group&callStatus/t/Open/1/1/0/default-group&callStatus/t/Closed/1/1/0/default-group&+identifier/desc (opened on 15 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/cross-cooperation-for-csirts  Priorities for EU research  Analysis of the ECSO Strategic Research and Innovation Agenda (SRIA)  December 2017  30  3.

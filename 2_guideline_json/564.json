Furthermore, ENISA will use and share with communities the following recommendations:  1. EU and national policy makers should ensure that current education approaches are  enhanced by a set of actions to improve cybersecurity know-how in the whole of society, and  security should be incorporated as a supporting theme that plays throughout the computing  curriculum;  2. Schools and institutes offering higher education should ensure that research and education  programmes holistically integrate the perspectives of technology, information, organisations,  business and people;  3. Educators should consider deploying a blended learning model, which combines classroom  instruction with online curricula, interactive tools, hands-on activities and online assessments to  provide immediate feedback;  4. Find better ways of working directly with the community in creative ways, advocacy work  and empowering the users;  5. Use as a case study the Finnish model of Triple Helix Cooperation: business, academia and  public authorities.  By closely monitoring current work, brokering best practices and planning in advance we participate  in this process.  Stepping up the national effort on networks and information security education  and training are the main priorities!

It is  aimed at all members of the Network and Information Security (1) Education community in Europe.  ENISA is committed in taking the lead in encouraging the exchange of NIS best practices and it follows  a strong community-building process for NIS Education stakeholders.  In the 2013 report, Brokerage model for network and information security in education (2), after  presenting case studies from Member States, we concluded with the following recommendations:  1. ENISA and EC should address Cybersecurity awareness at all levels in different arenas for  sharing information;  2. Awareness organisations should pursue Public-Private partnerships in their educational  efforts for digital users;  3. NIS in Education community members should target specific stakeholders with different  methods and specific content.  The time has come to follow up on these recommendations and deliver on the results of the 2014  brokerage process.  Goal  In the context of this year’s work on NIS Education, examples were identified by the community to  deliver new material that will be consulted Europe-wide and inspire the way forward. The main goal  is to set the proper context for enhanced public-private NIS education partnerships. The selection of  case studies was done according to the collaborations we had on projects during the year.  Target audience  The target group is composed of educators, such as trainers, teachers and peers involved in formal  education and non-formal education, including lifelong learning.  Structure of this document  This report is developed in three parts with the first part on the current status of NIS PPPs, the main  part on case studies from organisations involved in NIS Education, and finally conclusions and  recommendations for practitioners. The annexes offer more information on case studies and  references on the online resources.

The Good Practice Guide on Cooperative  Models for Effective PPPs (3), published by ENISA in 2011, is a framework to provide a structure for  understanding a range of diverse implementation approaches both for new PPPs and evolving PPPs.  We recommend this study as background reading for a better understanding on PPPs.  PPP — An organised relationship between public and private organisations, which  establishes common scope and objectives and uses defined roles and work  methodology to achieve shared goals.  2.1 Policy references on PPPs  The Joint Communication to the European Parliament, the Council, the European Economic and Social  Committee and the Committee of the Regions — the Cybersecurity Strategy of the European Union:  ‘An Open, Safe and Secure Cyberspace’ (4) represents the European public roadmap for cybersecurity  actions. It describes the context, and at the same time, gives an indication of future actions that should  be taken into consideration. It names actors like ENISA and the Member States and it empowers digital  users by stating that cybersecurity is a shared responsibility:  The growing dependency on information and communications technologies in all domains  of human life has led to vulnerabilities which need to be properly defined, thoroughly  analysed, remedied or reduced. All relevant actors, whether public authorities, the private  sector or individual citizens, need to recognise this shared responsibility, take action to  protect themselves and if necessary ensure a coordinated response to strengthen  cybersecurity (5).  Furthermore, regarding public-private partnerships it mentions the European Public-Private  Partnership for Resilience (6) and the need in this context to:  Develop informal and voluntary cooperation, including between public and private sectors,  to boost security levels and exchange information and best practices (7).

The  policy document mentions the track record on this too:  ENISA has been involved in raising awareness through publishing reports, organising expert  workshops and developing public-private partnerships (8).  The path forward is thus set and ENISA continues to believe that public-private partnerships are the  main tool for efficient action.  2.2 The future  To facilitate implementation of these ideas we communicate an established model of cooperation and  we monitor its results closely. This model, depicted in the graph below, shows ENISA's role and the  partners with which we search to collaborate. Increasing the number of partners involved and bringing  them together for common benefits is part of the daily work. We should add that in best practice the  arrows exchange input both ways, in a bi-dimensional approach. Furthermore, for a mature dynamic  model, exchanges should take place at all levels and connections should appear between all  stakeholders involved. We benchmark future work according to all these criteria.

ENISA  aims to increase its partnerships with more organisations and to identify and help disseminate their  work so that it can be shared with the entire community. We recommend reading the case studies  with special attention to the methods used to build partnerships, the approach to working together  and setting the right metrics.  The case studies include:   CISCO’s networking Academy dedicated to professionals;   Cybersecurity education in Finland, describing academic programmes from universities and  the link to the national cybersecurity strategy;   The US National Cyber Security Alliance and their approach on working together to achieve  common results;   Trend Micro’s Internet Safety for Kids and Families Programme that shows the commitment  towards community education;   Intel's training programme and their integrating approach on education;  3.1 Cisco Networking Academy programme and cybersecurity education (10)  Every year, hundreds of thousands of Networking Academy (11) students worldwide gain the skills  needed to build, design and maintain computer networks, improving their career prospects while  fulfilling the global demand for networking professionals. With 10 000 academies in 165 countries, the  Networking Academy helps individuals to prepare for industry-recognised certifications and entry- level information and communication technology (ICT) careers in virtually every type of industry.  Students develop foundational skills in ICT while acquiring vital 21st-century career skills in problem  solving, collaboration and critical thinking.  The rapid growth of networks has created a global shortage of people who are qualified to implement  and maintain networking solutions, especially in places where networks are being built to promote  economic development. At the same time, people need access to better training and career  opportunities to successfully compete in the global economy. The Networking Academy helps to  address the growing demand for ICT professionals while improving career prospects in communities  around the world.  Model, education content and tools  The Networking Academy uses a public-private partnership model to create the ‘world’s largest  classroom’. Cisco partners with educational institutions, non-profit organisations, non-governmental  organisations and community centres that provide classroom space, computer lab equipment and  qualified instructors. Cisco provides online curricula, virtual learning tools, instructional support,  teacher training and professional development opportunities for instructors.  Networking Academy courses are offered in multiple languages through a blended-learning model  that combines classroom instruction with online curricula, interactive tools, hands-on activities and  online assessments that provide immediate feedback.  The core Networking Academy courses are designed to help students to prepare for industry  certifications and career paths. Industry certifications are highly respected by employers around the  world and help to validate the skills needed to launch successful careers in networking and ICT.

Public Private Partnerships in Network and Information Security Education  Case studies  October 2014  Page 8  3.2 Activities in Finland (12)  3.2.1 Cybersecurity Research and Education in Finnish Universities  Security and the cyber domain cover many walks of life and research subjects. A number of disciplines  address themes associated with cybersecurity. For a long time now questions associated with  cybersecurity have been studied in computer science and engineering, information systems science,  information processing science and ICT technology, as well as automation science and engineering.  Traditionally, universities have dedicated separate departments to information technology, the  information processing sciences and to automation science and engineering. In addition to these,  research has been intensified in big data, cloud services, usability and embedded systems, among  others, which also include perspectives on cybersecurity.  The Finnish Cybersecurity Strategy states that:  ‘As a small, capable and collaborative country Finland has excellent chances of rising to the  vanguard in cybersecurity. We have an extensive knowledge base and strong expertise and  a long tradition of close public-private cooperation, built on trust, as well as intersectional  collaboration.’  In support of continuously improving the competence and awareness of the actors of society, inputs  will be made to developing, utilising and training common cybersecurity and information security  instructions. Inputs into R & D and education will be increased, as well as action to improve  cybersecurity know-how in the whole of society.

One  of the Faculty’s primary strengths is its ability to view IT broadly, integrating various perspectives and  identifying the joint effects of different phenomena. This is combined with internationally recognised  research in the strategic areas, as well as with active societal interaction.  The Faculty of Information Technology responds to the challenges in research and education brought  by the development of information technology and digitalisation. The Faculty holistically integrates  the perspectives of technology, information, organisations, business and people in its research and  education as well as in its cooperation with interest groups.  According to Finland’s Cybersecurity Strategy, ensuring the security of society is a key task of the  government authorities and the vital functioning of our society must be secured in all situations.  Cybersecurity Strategy states that strategic guidelines are needed in support of continuously  improving the competence and awareness of the actors of society; inputs will be made into  developing, utilising and training common cybersecurity and information security instructions. Inputs  into R & D and education will be increased, as well as action to improve cybersecurity know-how in  the whole of society.  The Ministry of Employment and the Economy has selected five themes for the Innovative Cities (INKA)  programme 2014–20. The purpose of the programme is to accelerate major projects that create new  business and international competitive advantages through cooperation between cities and the state.  Jyväskylä was assigned a national coordinator role in Cybersecurity. The vision of the Cybersecurity  Theme is that Finland will become an internationally recognised global forerunner in cybersecurity  business and the awareness of cyber threats. The University of Jyväskylä has very important role  coordinating the national Cybersecurity Research and Education in this programme.  We build on the present Triple Helix cooperation: business, academia and  public authorities.  Cybersecurity Master’s Degree Studies  The Cybersecurity Master of Science education is a joint programme for both departments of the  Faculty of Information Technology: The Department of Computer Science and Information Systems  (CSIS) and the Department of Mathematical Information Technology (MIT). The Cyber World and its  security are examined from a social, functional, systemic and technological point of view during  courses.  Public Private Partnerships in Network and Information Security Education  Case studies  October 2014  Page 16  The extent of the Master’s degree programme is 120 ECTS credits. The objective of a cybersecurity  education is to create strong know-how in the demanding management and development tasks  implied in the total control of cybersecurity.  The aim of the Master’s degree programme in Cybersecurity is to provide solid skills in the kinds of  demanding management and development tasks that require comprehensive awareness in  cybersecurity. The studies comprise an entity which addresses the cyber world and its security from  societal, functional and technological perspectives.  A graduate in Cybersecurity is able to define cybersecurity risks in information, data networks,  computer systems, telecommunication networks and SCADA-systems. She or he knows the different  threat models of the cyber world, and knows the functional and technological solutions which are  related to the prevention of threats.  She or he has good readiness to design and to carry out cybersecurity strategies, and to lead the  functional and technological planning and development of cybersecurity that meets the requirements  of an organisation. A graduate is able to adapt the newest technologies to the cybersecurity issues  and is able to produce real-time plans and solutions.  The Cybersecurity Master of Science programme has two sub-programmes. In the CSIS department  the knowledge profile is cybersecurity in organisations and the typical job for graduated students is  Chief Information Security Officer, CISO.  In the MIT department the knowledge profile is cybersecurity technology and the typical job for  graduated students is Chief Security Technology Officer, CSTO.  We have identified 17 cybersecurity competence areas in the Cybersecurity Master’s programme:  Competence areas Courses covered the competence areas  1.

Human aspects of cyber security Course 1: Information privacy  The Master of Science education is carried out as a whole in which the time is used for different  projects (management, company projects, research projects, Master’s thesis) in addition to the  traditional multi-disciplinary two-year course. The Cybersecurity courses have also been designed for  people in their working life.  In the academic year 2013–14, there were approoximately 25 students in the Cybersecurity Master’s  programme. The goal is to achieve about 40 students. We have both young B.Sc. students who will  continue their studies in this programme and students from working life to complete their diploma to  Master’s degree level. Study goals and individual curricula are established through personal study  plans in which the students agree on the mandatory and elective studies and optional content,  established by the faculty and the departments for the Master’s degree programmes. All students  have their own personal study plans; the plans may recognise expertise acquired through previous  work experience.

THINK. CONNECT.  and National Cybersecurity Awareness Month  The National Cyber Security Alliance (NCSA) was founded in 2001 shortly after the terrorist attacks in  New York City and Washington. It was formed by a group of visionary industry leaders from Microsoft,  Computer Associates, AOL, Cisco, Symantec and McAfee that came to the realisation that not enough  was being done to educate the public about protecting themselves and their shared digital assets,  including risks to networks and critical infrastructure.  From the very beginning the guiding principles included that all the industry partners, even though  they might compete in other ways, had a shared interest in a safer, more secure and trusted Internet  and that success would be achieved by working closely with government, which also shared a stake  and interest as well.  Today, the NCSA’s mission is to educate and therefore empower a digital society to use the Internet  safely and securely at home, work and school, protecting the technology that individuals use, the  networks they connect to, and our shared digital assets ( 14 ). NCSA activities are funded by  contributions from its industry Board Members and the Department of Homeland Security. Current  NCSA Board members are: ADP, AT&T, Bank of America, Comcast, EMC, ESET, Facebook, Google, Intel,  Leidos, McAfee, Microsoft, Symantec, Verizon and VISA.  The public private partnership is based on a few key concepts:   No one entity is solely responsible for protecting the Internet, requiring us to work together;   To help all Internet users to be safer and more secure requires effort on an enormous scale  and no government agency can reach everyone or provide all the resources necessary on its  own;   Everyone benefits when Internet users know how to protect themselves and their business  interests;   The infrastructure of the Internet is complex and distributed between industry and  government, requiring a way to work together towards common goals.  Target audiences have always included home computer users and families, the education system, and  small and medium-sized businesses. Programmes have evolved over the years but now are focused  on four initiatives: Cyber Security Awareness Month (October), the STOP. THINK. CONNECT. campaign,  Data Privacy Day (January 28) and Re: Cyber (for CEOs and corporate governance).  STOP. THINK. CONNECT.  (13) Author: Michael Kaiser, Executive Director NCSA  (14) http://www.staysafeonline.org/about-us/  http://www.staysafeonline.org/about-us/  Public Private Partnerships in Network and Information Security Education  Case studies  October 2014  Page 19  The NCSA model is to harmonise around messaging and the calendar and to  engage a broad array of stakeholders to communicate those core messages. In  addition, the NCSA counts on stakeholders to participate actively in core  programmes, such as STOP. THINK. CONNECT. and the National Cyber Security  Awareness Months so messaging and education reaches as many people and  organisations as possible.  STOP. THINK. CONNECT. reflects that operating philosophy. In the United States, the Alliance  had  many companies, government and organisations actively engaged in helping people to use the  Internet safely and more securely. However, the education and awareness landscape was cluttered  with numerous pieces of advice about how to stay safe, a great deal of technical advice that users  didn’t understand and significant fear-based messaging that encouraged users not go online.  In 2009 President Obama’s Cyberspace Policy recommended that, ‘The Federal government, in  partnership with educators and industry, should conduct a national cybersecurity public awareness  and education effort.’ (15) In response, in an unprecedented initiative, the NCSA along with the Anti- phishing Working Group (16) brought together twenty-five companies and seven government agencies  to explore the possibility of building a national education and awareness campaign. The group readily  agreed to take on the task and over the next fourteen months worked in close collaboration and by  consensus to conduct research and develop a suite of messaging to be available and used by all.  The work was recognised as the national message when President Barack Obama declared STOP.  THINK. CONNECT. the national cybersecurity awareness campaign during his Presidential  Proclamation of National Cyber Security Awareness Month in 2010.  An excerpt of the proclamation reads:  ‘Together with businesses, community-based organisations and public- and private-sector partners,  we are launching a National Cybersecurity Awareness Campaign: ‘STOP. THINK. CONNECT.’ Through  this initiative, Americans can learn about and become more aware of risks in cyberspace, and be  empowered to make choices that contribute to our overall security.’ (17)  Rather than originate from only one place, by design, the campaign uses the relationships that already  exist between companies, government and education institutions and NGOs to reach their core  audiences more quickly. In addition, any organisation developing materials is encouraged to share  them with others that are participating in the campaign. Because the campaign is based on research  that was done collectively and in partnership, the NCSA has found that adoption by others has been  fairly rapid.  Some outcomes to date include:   More than 150 partners signing a licence to use the STOP. THINK. CONNECT. message (18). The  campaign is used by companies (large and small), police departments, education institutions  and government.   The campaign has been used in the subway and public transport systems in major US cities,  including Washington, Boston and Chicago (19).

THINK. CONNECT in their core messaging (21).   Campaigns have been developed around specific areas of advice such as Keep a Clean  Machine, which encourages users to make sure that all software is up to date (22).   Some companies — Campbell Soups, Merck, Warner Brothers Pictures — have started to use  the materials in their internal awareness campaigns for employees.   Leading organisations, such as the Better Business Bureau have begun to incorporate the  campaign into their public facing work (23).   Materials have been developed for the classroom and the NCSA has partnered with a couple  of companies and the Department of Homeland Security to bring assemblies to schools (24).  International expansion  While originally envisioned to start in the United States, the campaign has grown internationally very  quickly. This quick uptake of the message reflects the simple universality of the message combined  with the increasing desire by people across the globe to reap the benefits of the Internet by using it  safely and more securely. The NCSA and APWG have signed Memorandums of Understanding with  regional organisations including the Organisation of American States and APCERT to encourage their  members to join the campaign, and directly with countries, such as Public Safety Canada and Paraguay.  Additionally NGOs in India, Spain and Australia have signed on as well.  With help of companies and local partners, STOP. THINK. CONNECT. materials are now available in  Spanish, French, Brazilian Portuguese and Japanese (25).  National Cyber Security Awareness Month (NCSAM)  Developed by the Department of Homeland Security and NCSA and first celebrated in 2004, the  National Cyber Security Awareness Month has grown in size, scope and reach.  The theme for the last few years has been ‘our shared responsibility’, and reflects the role that every  Internet user plays in staying safer and more secure online.  In many aspects the NCSAM is a grassroots campaign. Companies, organisations and educational  institutions from around the country participate in a variety of ways reaching their customers, citizens  (20) https://www.youtube.com/v/gnEykE9_6v0  (21) http://www.stopthinkconnect.org/get-involved/partner-program/how-partners-use-stop-think-connect  (22) www.stopthinkconnect.org/keepacleanmachine  (23) http://www.bbb.org/blog/2014/06/6-tips-for-protecting-your-identity-online-during-Internet-safety-month/  (24) http://stopthinkconnect.org/resources/landing/  (25) http://www.staysafeonline.org/ncsam/about  https://www.youtube.com/v/gnEykE9_6v0 http://www.stopthinkconnect.org/get-involved/partner-program/how-partners-use-stop-think-connect http://www.stopthinkconnect.org/keepacleanmachine http://www.bbb.org/blog/2014/06/6-tips-for-protecting-your-identity-online-during-internet-safety-month/ http://stopthinkconnect.org/resources/landing/ http://www.staysafeonline.org/ncsam/about  Public Private Partnerships in Network and Information Security Education  Case studies  October 2014  Page 21  or students. The NCSA maintains a web portal with tip sheets, graphics, ideas for activities, event  listings and champions that want to express their support for the month (26).  In 2013, the 10th anniversary of NCSAM, was a tremendous success. A snapshot of the results is as  follows:   3 130 online articles/print articles/blogs were written about the month — an increase of  193 % (1 067 in 2012);   Total potential media impressions (includes multiple pick ups or releases and articles) reached  7 885 570 070 — an increase of 255 % (2 220 322 790 in 2012);   Total tweets using #NCSAM were over 16 000 ‐ an increase of 56 % over 2012 and had over  100 000 000 impressions and was used in over 85 countries;   The NCSA’s Twitter handles @stopthnkconnect, @staysafeonline and the #chatSTC (Twitter  chat series hash tag) had over 43 000 000 impressions;   The governors of all 50 US states issued proclamations in support of the month;   Facebook sponsored the live stream of the National Cyber Security Awareness Month Launch  event in Boston;   More than 340 companies, organisations, government entities and schools became  champions of the month, a 49 % increase from 2012.

The global programme is designed to do this  through partnerships, volunteering, grants and donations.  The programme’s vision is to extend Trend Micro overall corporate vision of creating a world safe for  the exchange of digital information to the world’s youngest citizens. Its mission is to help kids, families  and schools to use technology safely, responsibly and successfully. The programme’s strategy to  achieve this mission has four pillars:   EDUCATE: Promote online safety, digital literacy and digital citizenship;   INNOVATE: Use Trend Micro expertise, technology and resources when and where applicable;   COLLABORATE: Team with experts for their knowledge and to raise awareness together;   EMULATE: Practice what Trend Micro preaches. Lead by example.  What the programme encourages and actively promotes is Youth advocacy: Empowering youth to be  safe, responsible and successful online and to have a role in their own safety and success and Parent  advocacy: Providing parents and teachers with the resources to help young people be safe,  responsible and successful online. The overall programme goal is to help audiences to be aware of the  risks presented by the Internet and technology, but it goes beyond just discussing safety. It attempts  to help people to use technology in ways that are productive for themselves and for others.  Global impact and outreach to date  Trend Micro feels strongly about making sure programmes like the ISKF programme are in fact making  a difference with the intended audience. Measuring this type of impact is a challenge for every  organisation. Trend Micro measures its global activities and outreach to students, teachers, parents  and guardians in addition to a more important measurement/barometer: the feedback and behaviour  changes communicated to the company from the communities where the ISKF programme is active.  A few interesting numbers about the ISKF programme can be found in ANNEX C.  Partnerships and coalition-building  The topic of Internet safety, digital literacy and digital citizenship spans numerous issues: ranging from  online social interactions to data theft to respecting laws. Trend Micro is collaborating with multiple  organisations who share the same goals of making the Internet safe for young people so that their  combined efforts and expertise can bring the most valuable information and advice to the greatest  number of people. These organisations share the ISKF vision and have made a lot of positive strides  towards that end. They also believe in promoting the positive aspects of the Internet to children and  families while educating them on the risks and how to avoid them. They are enthusiastically  supporting the team’s efforts and have contributed and advised on so much along the way. With its  resources and ability to reach a wider audience, the team hopes to further the good work they started  years ago.  In order to achieve its mission, the team is working closely with organisations of all kinds — non-profit,  for-profit and governmental — as the company believes that the issues are wide-ranging and require  collaboration with a number of experts in multiple countries. To name a few: the National Centre for  Missing and Exploited Children, the Family Online Safety Institute, Connect Safely, Childnet  International, MOIGE, INHOPE, EducAid, Twitter, Yahoo!, PTO Today, Webwise and the UK  (27) Author Aurélia RENAUD, Trend Micro  Public Private Partnerships in Network and Information Security Education  Case studies  October 2014  Page 23  government’s Cyber Streetwise campaign. ISKF volunteers from all around the world have built strong  local relationships with organisations, government bodies and non-profits to further the ISKF mission.  Some specific ways in which Trend Micro collaborate with other organisations include: co-developing  or financially supporting education materials designed for kids, parents or schools; getting input into  the design of products developed by the company that can directly protect families and kids; working  with organisations such as the National Centre for Missing and Exploited Children and INHOPE to help  stop the distribution of child sexual abuse material online; public speaking in the form of panels or  presentations; promoting each other’s expertise and education materials to the respective audiences  and providing consultation to each other in the areas of the respective core competencies.  ISKF education and advocacy activities include:   Engaging directly with schools and communities to educate;  o Talking Internet safety to parents/guardians and teachers;  o A competition with a difference: What’s Your Story is an internationally acclaimed  competition for young people now running in eight countries worldwide. It is a  powerful way for young people to raise awareness within their school/community and  they become advocates of their own online message. It is also an educational activity  for families because everyone can view and rate entries online. Trend Micro strongly  believes that young people can promote a safe, responsible and successful online  world. What’s Your Story is a competition for children 8 years and upwards. They  submit a two-minute film or poster under the announced Internet Safety theme. They  upload their entries to the website for public viewing and voting (each country has a  unique website). Entries with the highest views and votes are shortlisted for final  decision with independent judges.   Global/local events and campaigns;   Global/local partnerships;   Global/local sponsorships;   Social media engagement (28).  (28) Blog http://internetsafety.trendmicro.com/ Web www.trendmicro.com/internetsafety  Public Private Partnerships in Network and Information Security Education  Case studies  October 2014  Page 24  3.5 INTEL approach: Security — the ever-present ‘leitmotif’ for tomorrow’s engineers (29)  Intel’s observation is that many technologists, even world-class engineers, are unprepared  to think about and deal with the security issues raised as they develop solutions. They do not know  how to systematically address these problems or assess their importance. Because of this, INTEL  hypothesise that a security curriculum needs to be developed in a multi-disciplinary framework that  puts security features into the context in which they will be used. Security is supplemental to core  features in a technology and is rarely the principal aim of most developers, but it arises at every level  of a system design. They believe that security needs to become a leitmotif that every engineer learns  to think about at any level of a system design. Thus, designed-in-security is an important principle  for any technology development process. Accordingly, the goal is to incorporate security as a  supporting theme that plays throughout the entire symphony of the computing curriculum. They  want every computing and engineering student to have basic knowledge about security and be able  to recognise specific aspects of designed-in security wherever they may arise within a system’s  architecture. In order to do this, the student needs to be able to understand some of the basic  models for thinking about security issues.  Intel’s Approach  The goal of Intel’s University Security Curriculum Initiative is to develop a pipeline of students who  understand security challenges. By raising awareness of Intel’s philosophy of designed-in security  and providing funding support to develop security curriculum content, Intel hopes that its activities  will be seen by fellow industry partners and help to amplify this message to institutes, faculties and  computing/engineering students at all levels of its importance. By working with key faculties,  Intel seeks to identify opportunities to develop modules or whole courses that will provide benefits  to the academic community and be included in diverse course syllabi. Through these efforts,  Intel provides motivation to encourage a culture of faculty collaboration to embrace the  incorporation and dissemination of security content. Intel seeks to identify novel approaches and  methodologies for cybersecurity education and reaches out to a diverse set of academic partners  that have created content to advance student cybersecurity learning. The initial focus of this  programme is to stimulate undergraduate education which Intel believes requires a multi-faceted  approach. First, the programme seeds the development of security content to build a repository of  the elements of security curriculum which it hosts on its Security website. Second, the programme  looks at different delivery vehicles to disseminate the awareness of security concepts through books,  games, contests and videos. Intel believes that a flexible approach is required to produce students  with the needed abilities. Next, students need to develop critical thinking skills; the programme  hosts workshops to bring together faculty, industry and government agencies that foster a security  curriculum community. The goal of these workshops is to share course materials and labs which  provide those hands-on experiences and inspire students to adapt their learning to an ever-changing  world. Finally, the programme looks to provide insight into understanding the demand in the  cybersecurity labour market through its partnership with fellow industry partners. Intel believes that  institution decisions towards academic courses, faculties and programmes will be influenced by the  anticipated needs of the labour market for security-trained students.  (29) Author: Scott Buck, INTEL Higher Education Programme  Public Private Partnerships in Network and Information Security Education  Case studies  October 2014  Page 25  A block diagram of this process flow can be found in figure below:  Repository of course modules  Intel’s Security Curriculum Programme looks to build a security repository of content with a  balanced approach. In practice, security requires the utilisation of three elements: mitigation,  vulnerability analysis and validation. First there is a modelling effort to capture a threat model.  Second the threat model is used to propose mitigations. Finally there is an analysis and validation  stage, to determine how well the proposed mitigations address the threats.  Consequently, the security curriculum elements for this programme are grouped into three  dimensions: vulnerability analysis — identify what system threats exist; mitigations — identify how  to defend against the identified threats; and validation — verify that the mitigations address the  threats identified. Through the programme’s engagements with faculties, it appears that most  students have some knowledge about mitigations, but know little about threat modelling or  validating mitigations against a threat model. The programme seeks to address these findings by  supporting curricula that will improve students’ understanding of these elements. Using this  approach the programme has sought out and continues to identify faculties in Europe that provide  content in these groups. Available course modules in ANNEX D.  Looking at privacy  This year Intel launched a new initiative in privacy to extend and complement the security  curriculum initiative. The privacy initiative will seek to engage universities in the area of multi- disciplinary privacy education. The mission of this programme is to develop a pipeline of capable  students who understand multi-disciplinary privacy challenges, can help to create privacy-aware  technologies and a privacy-friendly ecosystem. To meet the scope of this mission, the programme is  sponsoring faculty teams (e.g. a technologists, economists and policy professionals) that can  leverage each of their respective strengths to develop comprehensive content. The output from  these teams will be multi-disciplinary curricula content that will contain elements of privacy  technologies, user requirements, user psychology and legal, economic and policy frameworks for  privacy. The privacy initiative will seek to engage faculties in privacy topics that are cross-cutting i.e.:  data protection; privacy policies and regulations; legal frameworks for privacy, economics of privacy;  regional differences in privacy; usability and user adoption, information usage models. But the  programme also has a technology focus i.e.: privacy-preserving protocols and architectures; re- identification and other privacy attacks; privacy by design; user-controlled privacy models; and  Public Private Partnerships in Network and Information Security Education  Case studies  October 2014  Page 26  privacy support in low-power devices. The first funded faculty team under this new initiative was  with MIT Professor Daniel Weitzner (Law/Internet public policy) with co-authors Hal Abelson  (Computer Science) and Michael Fischer (Anthropology) for multi-disciplinary, cross-cultural  perspectives on information privacy. The objective of this work is to develop curriculum content  aimed at providing CS undergraduates with a cross-disciplinary and cross-cultural perspective on  privacy. Additionally, this grant ties in collaborations with universities in Brazil, UK and the  Netherlands.  In conclusion, the above-funded faculty and their content areas are important topic areas and  students with those skills would be desired by the industry. Intel’s Security/Privacy Curriculum  Initiative focuses on stimulating the formation of an academic community to develop and share  content knowledge, which addresses student learning needs by providing the foundation for needed  skills and the tools of tomorrow.  Public Private Partnerships in Network and Information Security Education  Case studies  October 2014  Page 27  Public Private Partnerships in Network and Information Security Education  Case studies  October 2014  Page 28  4 Conclusions  This report has highlighted some optimal measures for working in public-private partnerships for  network and information-security education. It also provides an example of ENISA’s role in brokerage  between stakeholders and achieving coordination.  To conclude, we take the opportunity to emphasise some of the learning points from these case  studies, points that we will use and share with our communities. All these should be tackled by  universities around Europe, supported by national authorities from Member States together with  ENISA and EC, but also interested stakeholders from industry.  1. EU and national policy makers should ensure that current education approaches are  enhanced by a set of actions to improve cybersecurity know-how in the whole of society, and  security should be incorporated as a supporting theme that plays throughout the computing  curriculum;  2. Schools and institutes offering higher education should ensure that research and education  programmes holistically integrate the perspectives of technology, information, organisations,  business and people;  3. Eductaors should consider deploying a blended learning model, which combines classroom  instruction with online curricula, interactive tools, hands-on activities and online assessments  to provide immediate feedback;  4. Find better ways of working directly with the community in creative ways, advocacy work and  empowering the users;  5. Use as a case study the Finnish model of Triple Helix Cooperation: business, academia and  public authorities.  The priority for this area of work can be read in the EU Cybersecurity Strategy and also in the key  impact indicators for NIS Education at ENISA, namely:  Stepping up the national effort on network and information security education  and training are the main priorities!

THINK. CONNECT.  Week 1 aims to raise online safety awareness among all Americans and reinforce STOP.  THINK. CONNECT. and the simple measures that everyone should take to be safer and more  secure online.  Week 2: 6–10 October 2014  Theme: Secure Development of IT Products  Building security into information technology products is key to enhanced cybersecurity.  Security is an essential element of software design, development, testing and maintenance.  The software that we use every day on our phones, tablets and computers may have  vulnerabilities that can compromise our personal information and privacy. This week will  target these stakeholders and educate others about what to do and look for in products.  Week 3: 13–17 October  2014  Theme: Critical Infrastructure and The Internet of Things  The Internet underlies nearly every facet of our daily lives and is the foundation for much of  the critical infrastructure that keeps our nation running. The systems that support  electricity, financial services, transport and communications are increasingly  interconnected. The Internet of Things — the ability of objects and devices to transfer data  — is changing the way that we use technology. Week Four highlights the importance of  protecting critical infrastructure and properly securing all devices that are connected to the  Internet.  Week 4: 20–24 October 2014  Theme: Cyber Security for Small and Medium-Sized Businesses and Entrepreneurs  Small and medium-sized businesses are an important part of our nation’s economy, but they  often do not see themselves as a target for a cyber attack. Strong cybersecurity practices are  vital within these organisations. Entrepreneurs are recognising the cybersecurity field as a  burgeoning marketplace. This week will focus on what emerging and established businesses  can do to protect their organisations, customers and employees, as well as cybersecurity as  a business opportunity using tools such as the DHS C3 Voluntary Programme.  Week 5: 27–31 October 2014  Theme: Cyber Crime and Law Enforcement  This week will help to draw awareness to, and educate law enforcement officers about, how  to assist their communities in combating cyber crime and educate the general public with  ways to protect themselves from becoming a victim of identity theft, fraud, phishing and  other crimes.

Many students asked specific questions. Each  student was given a booklet for further study or as a reminder. Overall, the initiative was very  interesting, precise and careful and the assessment can only be very positive. The increasingly valuable  collaboration between schools and local resources in order to constantly improve the provision of  training for the benefit of all the participants should be emphasised. Trusting in continuity over the  years of this particular project, we express gratitude and appreciation to the organisers for the valid  proposal, for their efforts, for the materials received and for their ongoing support.’ Dirigente  Scolastico, Scuola Media Statale Peyron, Italy  ‘Social networking plays such a big part in young people’s lives and this is what attracted us to ‘What’s  Your Story’. It is very relevant and very real to young people everywhere. We really do need to raise  more awareness about online safety and responsibility and are very proud that our film will be used as  future educational material too.’Siobhan Fitzgerald, (teacher) & overall winner of What’s Your story,  Ireland  ‘The What’s Your Story competition gives young people the opportunity and the space to consider how  their Internet use affects them personally. Webwise.ie is very proud to be associated with an initiative  that encourages children to be creative and to express themselves freely on topics that are of great  importance to them. In the context of ubiquitous Internet access, it is vital that we implement  strategies such as this that focus on empowerment, prioritising critical thinking and engagement.’  Simon Grehan, National Centre for Technology in Education, Dublin City University, Ireland.  Public Private Partnerships in Network and Information Security Education  Case studies  October 2014  Page 34  ANNEX D  Available Course Modules  Below are course overviews from funded faculties:  Dusko Pavlovic (Royal Holloway, University of London), Social and economic processes for  information security  The course provides content to inform future security professionals, on one hand, about the  economic tools that address some of the needs for quantitative methodologies; and on the other  hand about methods to include security into economic and business analyses. The need for such  methods is increasingly felt among the security practitioners and stakeholders. This course brings  together some methods normally taught to the students of economics, with some methods normally  taught to the students of computer science.  Angela Sasse (University College London), Usable Security through Serious Games  The approach for engaging this faculty was teaching material to develop a game ‘Serious Game —  for our ‘People and Security’. This game is to help students understand the complex interactions  between technical and human elements in an organisation, business processes and information  security policies and mechanisms, and information security risks and organisational strategies for  making a profit. The aim is to enable students to identify information security risks in a specific  organisational context, and manage them in a way that fits with the organisation’s business goals,  processes and culture. Additionally, this game helps students to learn about complex interactions  (by showing hidden costs, and the side and downstream effects of deploying security mechanisms),  and increases student motivation because the game adds fun and competitive elements. Students  will play parts of the game in single-player mode to acquire the basic concepts, but the application  to specific organisational scenarios will be a multi-player game.  Michael Huth (Imperial College London) Integrating Security Protocols into the Curriculum  The teaching materials developed in this area of security were based on protocol design and  validation, which students can then use in order to acquire skills and competencies in modelling and  analysing such protocols through the active use of bespoke formal methods tools.  Ingrid Verbauwhede (KU Leuven), Secure Embedded Circuits and Systems  We developed a set of courses focused on Secure Embedded Circuits and Systems. Here a traditional  circuit designer typically has to balance three optimisation goals: area, throughput and  power/energy consumption. However making the implementation of cryptographic algorithms and  components physically secure adds a fourth optimisation goal. The circuit implementation also has  to resist physical attacks, both active and passive attacks. The curriculum also contains hands-on  experiments and lab sessions to introduce students to the challenges that they will be facing in  developing new embedded ICT circuits/systems.  N. Asokan (University of Helsinki) Mobile Platform Security  The faculty created two new courses on security technologies for advanced Computer Science  students. Software Security: the motivation behind this course, when the industry recruits new CS  graduates to work on software projects, they usually need to provide in-house training on selected  software security aspects. The objective of this course was to expose students to  Public Private Partnerships in Network and Information Security Education  Case studies  October 2014  Page 35  Software security methodologies that are widely used in the industry. The next course was Mobile  (Platform) Security: The objective of this course was to provide students with the background  necessary to carry out graduate-level research in mobile platform security.  Aleksy Schubert (University of Warsaw), Constructing Trusted Code Base  The support to this faculty created a new course on security technologies for advanced Computer  Science students. Constructing Trusted Code Base (TCB): The objective for this course was to provide  students with the basic information concerning the TCB and contemporary methods to construct  such software and combine it with hardware platforms. Further, material was provided to students  with an understanding of the main cryptographic schemes currently in use and the associated  challenges in applying these schemes.  Jean-Pierre Seifert (TU Berlin), Embedded System Security Course Development  This course looks at integrated course modules on embedded system security and addresses areas  such as common software security problems and what are their underlying causes. Further it will  bring students’ attention to techniques, guidelines and principles, and tools to prevent or detect  security problems such as buffer overflows, integer overflows, SQL injection, XSS and race  conditions. They will develop skills and techniques to prevent or detect problems including threat  modelling, check lists and coding standards, static analysis tools, code reviews, typing, static analysis,  language-based security (or platform-based security), security middleware, runtime monitoring,  information flow analysis, programme verification and proof-carrying code.  Looking at Privacy  This year Intel launched a new initiative in privacy to extend and complement the security  curriculum initiative. The privacy initiative will seek to engage universities in the area of multi- disciplinary privacy education. The mission of this programme is to develop a pipeline of capable  students who understand multi-disciplinary privacy challenges, can to help create privacy aware  technologies and privacy-friendly ecosystem. To meet the scope of this mission, the programme is  sponsoring faculty teams (e.g. a technologists, economists and policy professionals) that can  leverage each of their respective strengths to develop comprehensive content. The output from  these teams will be multi-disciplinary curricula content that will contain elements of privacy  technologies, user requirements, user psychology, and legal, economic and policy frameworks for  privacy.The privacy initiative will seek to engage faculties in privacy topics that are cross-cutting i.e.:  data protection; privacy policies and regulations; legal frameworks for privacy, economics of privacy;  regional differences in privacy; usability and user adoption, information usage models. But the  programme also has a technology focus i.e.: privacy-preserving protocols and architectures; re- identification and other privacy attacks; privacy by design; user-controlled privacy models; and  privacy support in low-power devices.The first funded faculty team under this new initiative was  with MIT Professor Daniel Weitzner (Law/Internet public policy) with co-authors Hal Abelson  (Computer Science) and Michael Fischer (Anthropology) for multi-disciplinary, cross-cultural  perspectives on information privacy. The objective of this work is to develop curriculum content  aimed at providing CS undergraduates with a cross-disciplinary and cross-cultural perspective on  privacy. Additionally, this grant ties in collaborations with universities in Brazil, UK and the  Netherlands.In conclusion, the above-funded faculty and their content areas are important topic  areas and students with those skills would be desired by industry. Intel’s Security/Privacy Curriculum  Initiative focuses on stimulating the formation of an academic community to develop and share  content knowledge, which addresses student learning needs by providing the foundation for needed  skills and the tools of tomorrow.

ENISA is  committed to taking the lead in encouraging  the exchange of NIS best practices and it follows a  strong community-building process for NIS Education stakeholders.  In this report we recommend reading the case studies with special attention to the methods used to  build partnerships, the approach to working together and setting the right metrics. The case studies  include: CISCO’s networking Academy dedicated to professionals; Cybersecurity education in Finland  describing academic programmes from universities and the link to the national cybersecurity  strategy; The US National Cyber Security alliance and their approach on working together for  achieving common results; Trend Micro’s Internet Safety for Kids and Families Programme that  shows the commitment towards community education; Intel's training programme and their  integrating approach on education.  Furthermore, ENISA will use and share with communities the following recommendations:  1. EU and national policy makers should ensure that current education approaches are  enhanced by a set of actions to improve cybersecurity know-how in the whole of society, and  security should be incorporated as a supporting theme that plays throughout the computing  curriculum;  2. Schools and institutes offering higher education should ensure that research and education  programmes holistically integrate the perspectives of technology, information, organisations,  business and people;  3. Educators should consider deploying a blended learning model, which combines classroom  instruction with online curricula, interactive tools, hands-on activities and online assessments to  provide immediate feedback;  4. Find better ways of working directly with the community in creative ways, advocacy work  and empowering the users;  5. Use as a case study the Finnish model of Triple Helix Cooperation: business, academia and  public authorities.  By closely monitoring current work, brokering best practices and planning in advance we participate  in this process.  Stepping up the national effort on networks and information security education  and training are the main priorities!

It is  aimed at all members of the Network and Information Security (1) Education community in Europe.  ENISA is committed in taking the lead in encouraging the exchange of NIS best practices and it follows  a strong community-building process for NIS Education stakeholders.  In the 2013 report, Brokerage model for network and information security in education (2), after  presenting case studies from Member States, we concluded with the following recommendations:  1. ENISA and EC should address Cybersecurity awareness at all levels in different arenas for  sharing information;  2. Awareness organisations should pursue Public-Private partnerships in their educational  efforts for digital users;  3. NIS in Education community members should target specific stakeholders with different  methods and specific content.  The time has come to follow up on these recommendations and deliver on the results of the 2014  brokerage process.  Goal  In the context of this year’s work on NIS Education, examples were identified by the community to  deliver new material that will be consulted Europe-wide and inspire the way forward. The main goal  is to set the proper context for enhanced public-private NIS education partnerships. The selection of  case studies was done according to the collaborations we had on projects during the year.  Target audience  The target group is composed of educators, such as trainers, teachers and peers involved in formal  education and non-formal education, including lifelong learning.  Structure of this document  This report is developed in three parts with the first part on the current status of NIS PPPs, the main  part on case studies from organisations involved in NIS Education, and finally conclusions and  recommendations for practitioners. The annexes offer more information on case studies and  references on the online resources.

The Good Practice Guide on Cooperative  Models for Effective PPPs (3), published by ENISA in 2011, is a framework to provide a structure for  understanding a range of diverse implementation approaches both for new PPPs and evolving PPPs.  We recommend this study as background reading for a better understanding on PPPs.  PPP — An organised relationship between public and private organisations, which  establishes common scope and objectives and uses defined roles and work  methodology to achieve shared goals.  2.1 Policy references on PPPs  The Joint Communication to the European Parliament, the Council, the European Economic and Social  Committee and the Committee of the Regions — the Cybersecurity Strategy of the European Union:  ‘An Open, Safe and Secure Cyberspace’ (4) represents the European public roadmap for cybersecurity  actions. It describes the context, and at the same time, gives an indication of future actions that should  be taken into consideration. It names actors like ENISA and the Member States and it empowers digital  users by stating that cybersecurity is a shared responsibility:  The growing dependency on information and communications technologies in all domains  of human life has led to vulnerabilities which need to be properly defined, thoroughly  analysed, remedied or reduced. All relevant actors, whether public authorities, the private  sector or individual citizens, need to recognise this shared responsibility, take action to  protect themselves and if necessary ensure a coordinated response to strengthen  cybersecurity (5).  Furthermore, regarding public-private partnerships it mentions the European Public-Private  Partnership for Resilience (6) and the need in this context to:  Develop informal and voluntary cooperation, including between public and private sectors,  to boost security levels and exchange information and best practices (7).

The  policy document mentions the track record on this too:  ENISA has been involved in raising awareness through publishing reports, organising expert  workshops and developing public-private partnerships (8).  The path forward is thus set and ENISA continues to believe that public-private partnerships are the  main tool for efficient action.  2.2 The future  To facilitate implementation of these ideas we communicate an established model of cooperation and  we monitor its results closely. This model, depicted in the graph below, shows ENISA's role and the  partners with which we search to collaborate. Increasing the number of partners involved and bringing  them together for common benefits is part of the daily work. We should add that in best practice the  arrows exchange input both ways, in a bi-dimensional approach. Furthermore, for a mature dynamic  model, exchanges should take place at all levels and connections should appear between all  stakeholders involved. We benchmark future work according to all these criteria.

ENISA  aims to increase its partnerships with more organisations and to identify and help disseminate their  work so that it can be shared with the entire community. We recommend reading the case studies  with special attention to the methods used to build partnerships, the approach to working together  and setting the right metrics.  The case studies include:   CISCO’s networking Academy dedicated to professionals;   Cybersecurity education in Finland, describing academic programmes from universities and  the link to the national cybersecurity strategy;   The US National Cyber Security Alliance and their approach on working together to achieve  common results;   Trend Micro’s Internet Safety for Kids and Families Programme that shows the commitment  towards community education;   Intel's training programme and their integrating approach on education;  3.1 Cisco Networking Academy programme and cybersecurity education (10)  Every year, hundreds of thousands of Networking Academy (11) students worldwide gain the skills  needed to build, design and maintain computer networks, improving their career prospects while  fulfilling the global demand for networking professionals. With 10 000 academies in 165 countries, the  Networking Academy helps individuals to prepare for industry-recognised certifications and entry- level information and communication technology (ICT) careers in virtually every type of industry.  Students develop foundational skills in ICT while acquiring vital 21st-century career skills in problem  solving, collaboration and critical thinking.  The rapid growth of networks has created a global shortage of people who are qualified to implement  and maintain networking solutions, especially in places where networks are being built to promote  economic development. At the same time, people need access to better training and career  opportunities to successfully compete in the global economy. The Networking Academy helps to  address the growing demand for ICT professionals while improving career prospects in communities  around the world.  Model, education content and tools  The Networking Academy uses a public-private partnership model to create the ‘world’s largest  classroom’. Cisco partners with educational institutions, non-profit organisations, non-governmental  organisations and community centres that provide classroom space, computer lab equipment and  qualified instructors. Cisco provides online curricula, virtual learning tools, instructional support,  teacher training and professional development opportunities for instructors.  Networking Academy courses are offered in multiple languages through a blended-learning model  that combines classroom instruction with online curricula, interactive tools, hands-on activities and  online assessments that provide immediate feedback.  The core Networking Academy courses are designed to help students to prepare for industry  certifications and career paths. Industry certifications are highly respected by employers around the  world and help to validate the skills needed to launch successful careers in networking and ICT.

N/A  Cybersecurity and network security courses  In the age of the Internet of Everything (IoE), the networked connections of people, processes, data  and things create a greater need for a robust security infrastructure. The network is used for  everything from storing an organisation’s confidential data, to storing personal financial and health  information. More connections make data more vulnerable to attacks, creating a growing need for  individuals with cybersecurity skills.  The Introduction to Cybersecurity course covers trends in cybersecurity and provides examples of the  need for cybersecurity skills in various industries.  The CCNA Security course provides a next step for individuals who want to enhance their CCNA-level  skill set and help to meet the growing demand for network security professionals.

A number of disciplines  address themes associated with cybersecurity. For a long time now questions associated with  cybersecurity have been studied in computer science and engineering, information systems science,  information processing science and ICT technology, as well as automation science and engineering.  Traditionally, universities have dedicated separate departments to information technology, the  information processing sciences and to automation science and engineering. In addition to these,  research has been intensified in big data, cloud services, usability and embedded systems, among  others, which also include perspectives on cybersecurity.  The Finnish Cybersecurity Strategy states that:  ‘As a small, capable and collaborative country Finland has excellent chances of rising to the  vanguard in cybersecurity. We have an extensive knowledge base and strong expertise and  a long tradition of close public-private cooperation, built on trust, as well as intersectional  collaboration.’  In support of continuously improving the competence and awareness of the actors of society, inputs  will be made to developing, utilising and training common cybersecurity and information security  instructions. Inputs into R & D and education will be increased, as well as action to improve  cybersecurity know-how in the whole of society.

The Faculty of Information  Technology plays a key role in developing one of the University’s core fields, human technology. One  of the Faculty’s primary strengths is its ability to view IT broadly, integrating various perspectives and  identifying the joint effects of different phenomena. This is combined with internationally recognised  research in the strategic areas, as well as with active societal interaction.  The Faculty of Information Technology responds to the challenges in research and education brought  by the development of information technology and digitalisation. The Faculty holistically integrates  the perspectives of technology, information, organisations, business and people in its research and  education as well as in its cooperation with interest groups.  According to Finland’s Cybersecurity Strategy, ensuring the security of society is a key task of the  government authorities and the vital functioning of our society must be secured in all situations.  Cybersecurity Strategy states that strategic guidelines are needed in support of continuously  improving the competence and awareness of the actors of society; inputs will be made into  developing, utilising and training common cybersecurity and information security instructions. Inputs  into R & D and education will be increased, as well as action to improve cybersecurity know-how in  the whole of society.  The Ministry of Employment and the Economy has selected five themes for the Innovative Cities (INKA)  programme 2014–20. The purpose of the programme is to accelerate major projects that create new  business and international competitive advantages through cooperation between cities and the state.  Jyväskylä was assigned a national coordinator role in Cybersecurity. The vision of the Cybersecurity  Theme is that Finland will become an internationally recognised global forerunner in cybersecurity  business and the awareness of cyber threats. The University of Jyväskylä has very important role  coordinating the national Cybersecurity Research and Education in this programme.  We build on the present Triple Helix cooperation: business, academia and  public authorities.  Cybersecurity Master’s Degree Studies  The Cybersecurity Master of Science education is a joint programme for both departments of the  Faculty of Information Technology: The Department of Computer Science and Information Systems  (CSIS) and the Department of Mathematical Information Technology (MIT). The Cyber World and its  security are examined from a social, functional, systemic and technological point of view during  courses.  Public Private Partnerships in Network and Information Security Education  Case studies  October 2014  Page 16  The extent of the Master’s degree programme is 120 ECTS credits. The objective of a cybersecurity  education is to create strong know-how in the demanding management and development tasks  implied in the total control of cybersecurity.  The aim of the Master’s degree programme in Cybersecurity is to provide solid skills in the kinds of  demanding management and development tasks that require comprehensive awareness in  cybersecurity. The studies comprise an entity which addresses the cyber world and its security from  societal, functional and technological perspectives.  A graduate in Cybersecurity is able to define cybersecurity risks in information, data networks,  computer systems, telecommunication networks and SCADA-systems. She or he knows the different  threat models of the cyber world, and knows the functional and technological solutions which are  related to the prevention of threats.  She or he has good readiness to design and to carry out cybersecurity strategies, and to lead the  functional and technological planning and development of cybersecurity that meets the requirements  of an organisation. A graduate is able to adapt the newest technologies to the cybersecurity issues  and is able to produce real-time plans and solutions.  The Cybersecurity Master of Science programme has two sub-programmes. In the CSIS department  the knowledge profile is cybersecurity in organisations and the typical job for graduated students is  Chief Information Security Officer, CISO.  In the MIT department the knowledge profile is cybersecurity technology and the typical job for  graduated students is Chief Security Technology Officer, CSTO.  We have identified 17 cybersecurity competence areas in the Cybersecurity Master’s programme:  Competence areas Courses covered the competence areas  1.

The Cybersecurity courses have also been designed for  people in their working life.  In the academic year 2013–14, there were approoximately 25 students in the Cybersecurity Master’s  programme. The goal is to achieve about 40 students. We have both young B.Sc. students who will  continue their studies in this programme and students from working life to complete their diploma to  Master’s degree level. Study goals and individual curricula are established through personal study  plans in which the students agree on the mandatory and elective studies and optional content,  established by the faculty and the departments for the Master’s degree programmes. All students  have their own personal study plans; the plans may recognise expertise acquired through previous  work experience.  Public Private Partnerships in Network and Information Security Education  Case studies  October 2014  Page 18  3.3 US — The National Cybersecurity Alliance (13)  Public Private Partnership  STOP. THINK. CONNECT.  and National Cybersecurity Awareness Month  The National Cyber Security Alliance (NCSA) was founded in 2001 shortly after the terrorist attacks in  New York City and Washington. It was formed by a group of visionary industry leaders from Microsoft,  Computer Associates, AOL, Cisco, Symantec and McAfee that came to the realisation that not enough  was being done to educate the public about protecting themselves and their shared digital assets,  including risks to networks and critical infrastructure.  From the very beginning the guiding principles included that all the industry partners, even though  they might compete in other ways, had a shared interest in a safer, more secure and trusted Internet  and that success would be achieved by working closely with government, which also shared a stake  and interest as well.  Today, the NCSA’s mission is to educate and therefore empower a digital society to use the Internet  safely and securely at home, work and school, protecting the technology that individuals use, the  networks they connect to, and our shared digital assets ( 14 ). NCSA activities are funded by  contributions from its industry Board Members and the Department of Homeland Security. Current  NCSA Board members are: ADP, AT&T, Bank of America, Comcast, EMC, ESET, Facebook, Google, Intel,  Leidos, McAfee, Microsoft, Symantec, Verizon and VISA.  The public private partnership is based on a few key concepts:   No one entity is solely responsible for protecting the Internet, requiring us to work together;   To help all Internet users to be safer and more secure requires effort on an enormous scale  and no government agency can reach everyone or provide all the resources necessary on its  own;   Everyone benefits when Internet users know how to protect themselves and their business  interests;   The infrastructure of the Internet is complex and distributed between industry and  government, requiring a way to work together towards common goals.  Target audiences have always included home computer users and families, the education system, and  small and medium-sized businesses. Programmes have evolved over the years but now are focused  on four initiatives: Cyber Security Awareness Month (October), the STOP. THINK. CONNECT. campaign,  Data Privacy Day (January 28) and Re: Cyber (for CEOs and corporate governance).  STOP. THINK. CONNECT.  (13) Author: Michael Kaiser, Executive Director NCSA  (14) http://www.staysafeonline.org/about-us/  http://www.staysafeonline.org/about-us/  Public Private Partnerships in Network and Information Security Education  Case studies  October 2014  Page 19  The NCSA model is to harmonise around messaging and the calendar and to  engage a broad array of stakeholders to communicate those core messages. In  addition, the NCSA counts on stakeholders to participate actively in core  programmes, such as STOP. THINK. CONNECT. and the National Cyber Security  Awareness Months so messaging and education reaches as many people and  organisations as possible.  STOP. THINK. CONNECT. reflects that operating philosophy. In the United States, the Alliance  had  many companies, government and organisations actively engaged in helping people to use the  Internet safely and more securely. However, the education and awareness landscape was cluttered  with numerous pieces of advice about how to stay safe, a great deal of technical advice that users  didn’t understand and significant fear-based messaging that encouraged users not go online.  In 2009 President Obama’s Cyberspace Policy recommended that, ‘The Federal government, in  partnership with educators and industry, should conduct a national cybersecurity public awareness  and education effort.’ (15) In response, in an unprecedented initiative, the NCSA along with the Anti- phishing Working Group (16) brought together twenty-five companies and seven government agencies  to explore the possibility of building a national education and awareness campaign. The group readily  agreed to take on the task and over the next fourteen months worked in close collaboration and by  consensus to conduct research and develop a suite of messaging to be available and used by all.  The work was recognised as the national message when President Barack Obama declared STOP.  THINK. CONNECT. the national cybersecurity awareness campaign during his Presidential  Proclamation of National Cyber Security Awareness Month in 2010.  An excerpt of the proclamation reads:  ‘Together with businesses, community-based organisations and public- and private-sector partners,  we are launching a National Cybersecurity Awareness Campaign: ‘STOP. THINK. CONNECT.’ Through  this initiative, Americans can learn about and become more aware of risks in cyberspace, and be  empowered to make choices that contribute to our overall security.’ (17)  Rather than originate from only one place, by design, the campaign uses the relationships that already  exist between companies, government and education institutions and NGOs to reach their core  audiences more quickly. In addition, any organisation developing materials is encouraged to share  them with others that are participating in the campaign. Because the campaign is based on research  that was done collectively and in partnership, the NCSA has found that adoption by others has been  fairly rapid.  Some outcomes to date include:   More than 150 partners signing a licence to use the STOP. THINK. CONNECT. message (18). The  campaign is used by companies (large and small), police departments, education institutions  and government.   The campaign has been used in the subway and public transport systems in major US cities,  including Washington, Boston and Chicago (19).

THINK. CONNECT in their core messaging (21).   Campaigns have been developed around specific areas of advice such as Keep a Clean  Machine, which encourages users to make sure that all software is up to date (22).   Some companies — Campbell Soups, Merck, Warner Brothers Pictures — have started to use  the materials in their internal awareness campaigns for employees.   Leading organisations, such as the Better Business Bureau have begun to incorporate the  campaign into their public facing work (23).   Materials have been developed for the classroom and the NCSA has partnered with a couple  of companies and the Department of Homeland Security to bring assemblies to schools (24).  International expansion  While originally envisioned to start in the United States, the campaign has grown internationally very  quickly. This quick uptake of the message reflects the simple universality of the message combined  with the increasing desire by people across the globe to reap the benefits of the Internet by using it  safely and more securely. The NCSA and APWG have signed Memorandums of Understanding with  regional organisations including the Organisation of American States and APCERT to encourage their  members to join the campaign, and directly with countries, such as Public Safety Canada and Paraguay.  Additionally NGOs in India, Spain and Australia have signed on as well.  With help of companies and local partners, STOP. THINK. CONNECT. materials are now available in  Spanish, French, Brazilian Portuguese and Japanese (25).  National Cyber Security Awareness Month (NCSAM)  Developed by the Department of Homeland Security and NCSA and first celebrated in 2004, the  National Cyber Security Awareness Month has grown in size, scope and reach.  The theme for the last few years has been ‘our shared responsibility’, and reflects the role that every  Internet user plays in staying safer and more secure online.  In many aspects the NCSAM is a grassroots campaign. Companies, organisations and educational  institutions from around the country participate in a variety of ways reaching their customers, citizens  (20) https://www.youtube.com/v/gnEykE9_6v0  (21) http://www.stopthinkconnect.org/get-involved/partner-program/how-partners-use-stop-think-connect  (22) www.stopthinkconnect.org/keepacleanmachine  (23) http://www.bbb.org/blog/2014/06/6-tips-for-protecting-your-identity-online-during-Internet-safety-month/  (24) http://stopthinkconnect.org/resources/landing/  (25) http://www.staysafeonline.org/ncsam/about  https://www.youtube.com/v/gnEykE9_6v0 http://www.stopthinkconnect.org/get-involved/partner-program/how-partners-use-stop-think-connect http://www.stopthinkconnect.org/keepacleanmachine http://www.bbb.org/blog/2014/06/6-tips-for-protecting-your-identity-online-during-internet-safety-month/ http://stopthinkconnect.org/resources/landing/ http://www.staysafeonline.org/ncsam/about  Public Private Partnerships in Network and Information Security Education  Case studies  October 2014  Page 21  or students. The NCSA maintains a web portal with tip sheets, graphics, ideas for activities, event  listings and champions that want to express their support for the month (26).  In 2013, the 10th anniversary of NCSAM, was a tremendous success. A snapshot of the results is as  follows:   3 130 online articles/print articles/blogs were written about the month — an increase of  193 % (1 067 in 2012);   Total potential media impressions (includes multiple pick ups or releases and articles) reached  7 885 570 070 — an increase of 255 % (2 220 322 790 in 2012);   Total tweets using #NCSAM were over 16 000 ‐ an increase of 56 % over 2012 and had over  100 000 000 impressions and was used in over 85 countries;   The NCSA’s Twitter handles @stopthnkconnect, @staysafeonline and the #chatSTC (Twitter  chat series hash tag) had over 43 000 000 impressions;   The governors of all 50 US states issued proclamations in support of the month;   Facebook sponsored the live stream of the National Cyber Security Awareness Month Launch  event in Boston;   More than 340 companies, organisations, government entities and schools became  champions of the month, a 49 % increase from 2012.

The global programme is designed to do this  through partnerships, volunteering, grants and donations.  The programme’s vision is to extend Trend Micro overall corporate vision of creating a world safe for  the exchange of digital information to the world’s youngest citizens. Its mission is to help kids, families  and schools to use technology safely, responsibly and successfully. The programme’s strategy to  achieve this mission has four pillars:   EDUCATE: Promote online safety, digital literacy and digital citizenship;   INNOVATE: Use Trend Micro expertise, technology and resources when and where applicable;   COLLABORATE: Team with experts for their knowledge and to raise awareness together;   EMULATE: Practice what Trend Micro preaches. Lead by example.  What the programme encourages and actively promotes is Youth advocacy: Empowering youth to be  safe, responsible and successful online and to have a role in their own safety and success and Parent  advocacy: Providing parents and teachers with the resources to help young people be safe,  responsible and successful online. The overall programme goal is to help audiences to be aware of the  risks presented by the Internet and technology, but it goes beyond just discussing safety. It attempts  to help people to use technology in ways that are productive for themselves and for others.  Global impact and outreach to date  Trend Micro feels strongly about making sure programmes like the ISKF programme are in fact making  a difference with the intended audience. Measuring this type of impact is a challenge for every  organisation. Trend Micro measures its global activities and outreach to students, teachers, parents  and guardians in addition to a more important measurement/barometer: the feedback and behaviour  changes communicated to the company from the communities where the ISKF programme is active.  A few interesting numbers about the ISKF programme can be found in ANNEX C.  Partnerships and coalition-building  The topic of Internet safety, digital literacy and digital citizenship spans numerous issues: ranging from  online social interactions to data theft to respecting laws. Trend Micro is collaborating with multiple  organisations who share the same goals of making the Internet safe for young people so that their  combined efforts and expertise can bring the most valuable information and advice to the greatest  number of people. These organisations share the ISKF vision and have made a lot of positive strides  towards that end. They also believe in promoting the positive aspects of the Internet to children and  families while educating them on the risks and how to avoid them. They are enthusiastically  supporting the team’s efforts and have contributed and advised on so much along the way. With its  resources and ability to reach a wider audience, the team hopes to further the good work they started  years ago.  In order to achieve its mission, the team is working closely with organisations of all kinds — non-profit,  for-profit and governmental — as the company believes that the issues are wide-ranging and require  collaboration with a number of experts in multiple countries. To name a few: the National Centre for  Missing and Exploited Children, the Family Online Safety Institute, Connect Safely, Childnet  International, MOIGE, INHOPE, EducAid, Twitter, Yahoo!, PTO Today, Webwise and the UK  (27) Author Aurélia RENAUD, Trend Micro  Public Private Partnerships in Network and Information Security Education  Case studies  October 2014  Page 23  government’s Cyber Streetwise campaign. ISKF volunteers from all around the world have built strong  local relationships with organisations, government bodies and non-profits to further the ISKF mission.  Some specific ways in which Trend Micro collaborate with other organisations include: co-developing  or financially supporting education materials designed for kids, parents or schools; getting input into  the design of products developed by the company that can directly protect families and kids; working  with organisations such as the National Centre for Missing and Exploited Children and INHOPE to help  stop the distribution of child sexual abuse material online; public speaking in the form of panels or  presentations; promoting each other’s expertise and education materials to the respective audiences  and providing consultation to each other in the areas of the respective core competencies.  ISKF education and advocacy activities include:   Engaging directly with schools and communities to educate;  o Talking Internet safety to parents/guardians and teachers;  o A competition with a difference: What’s Your Story is an internationally acclaimed  competition for young people now running in eight countries worldwide. It is a  powerful way for young people to raise awareness within their school/community and  they become advocates of their own online message. It is also an educational activity  for families because everyone can view and rate entries online. Trend Micro strongly  believes that young people can promote a safe, responsible and successful online  world. What’s Your Story is a competition for children 8 years and upwards. They  submit a two-minute film or poster under the announced Internet Safety theme. They  upload their entries to the website for public viewing and voting (each country has a  unique website). Entries with the highest views and votes are shortlisted for final  decision with independent judges.   Global/local events and campaigns;   Global/local partnerships;   Global/local sponsorships;   Social media engagement (28).

They do not know  how to systematically address these problems or assess their importance. Because of this, INTEL  hypothesise that a security curriculum needs to be developed in a multi-disciplinary framework that  puts security features into the context in which they will be used. Security is supplemental to core  features in a technology and is rarely the principal aim of most developers, but it arises at every level  of a system design. They believe that security needs to become a leitmotif that every engineer learns  to think about at any level of a system design. Thus, designed-in-security is an important principle  for any technology development process. Accordingly, the goal is to incorporate security as a  supporting theme that plays throughout the entire symphony of the computing curriculum. They  want every computing and engineering student to have basic knowledge about security and be able  to recognise specific aspects of designed-in security wherever they may arise within a system’s  architecture. In order to do this, the student needs to be able to understand some of the basic  models for thinking about security issues.  Intel’s Approach  The goal of Intel’s University Security Curriculum Initiative is to develop a pipeline of students who  understand security challenges. By raising awareness of Intel’s philosophy of designed-in security  and providing funding support to develop security curriculum content, Intel hopes that its activities  will be seen by fellow industry partners and help to amplify this message to institutes, faculties and  computing/engineering students at all levels of its importance. By working with key faculties,  Intel seeks to identify opportunities to develop modules or whole courses that will provide benefits  to the academic community and be included in diverse course syllabi. Through these efforts,  Intel provides motivation to encourage a culture of faculty collaboration to embrace the  incorporation and dissemination of security content. Intel seeks to identify novel approaches and  methodologies for cybersecurity education and reaches out to a diverse set of academic partners  that have created content to advance student cybersecurity learning. The initial focus of this  programme is to stimulate undergraduate education which Intel believes requires a multi-faceted  approach. First, the programme seeds the development of security content to build a repository of  the elements of security curriculum which it hosts on its Security website. Second, the programme  looks at different delivery vehicles to disseminate the awareness of security concepts through books,  games, contests and videos. Intel believes that a flexible approach is required to produce students  with the needed abilities. Next, students need to develop critical thinking skills; the programme  hosts workshops to bring together faculty, industry and government agencies that foster a security  curriculum community. The goal of these workshops is to share course materials and labs which  provide those hands-on experiences and inspire students to adapt their learning to an ever-changing  world. Finally, the programme looks to provide insight into understanding the demand in the  cybersecurity labour market through its partnership with fellow industry partners. Intel believes that  institution decisions towards academic courses, faculties and programmes will be influenced by the  anticipated needs of the labour market for security-trained students.  (29) Author: Scott Buck, INTEL Higher Education Programme  Public Private Partnerships in Network and Information Security Education  Case studies  October 2014  Page 25  A block diagram of this process flow can be found in figure below:  Repository of course modules  Intel’s Security Curriculum Programme looks to build a security repository of content with a  balanced approach. In practice, security requires the utilisation of three elements: mitigation,  vulnerability analysis and validation. First there is a modelling effort to capture a threat model.  Second the threat model is used to propose mitigations. Finally there is an analysis and validation  stage, to determine how well the proposed mitigations address the threats.  Consequently, the security curriculum elements for this programme are grouped into three  dimensions: vulnerability analysis — identify what system threats exist; mitigations — identify how  to defend against the identified threats; and validation — verify that the mitigations address the  threats identified. Through the programme’s engagements with faculties, it appears that most  students have some knowledge about mitigations, but know little about threat modelling or  validating mitigations against a threat model. The programme seeks to address these findings by  supporting curricula that will improve students’ understanding of these elements. Using this  approach the programme has sought out and continues to identify faculties in Europe that provide  content in these groups. Available course modules in ANNEX D.  Looking at privacy  This year Intel launched a new initiative in privacy to extend and complement the security  curriculum initiative. The privacy initiative will seek to engage universities in the area of multi- disciplinary privacy education. The mission of this programme is to develop a pipeline of capable  students who understand multi-disciplinary privacy challenges, can help to create privacy-aware  technologies and a privacy-friendly ecosystem. To meet the scope of this mission, the programme is  sponsoring faculty teams (e.g. a technologists, economists and policy professionals) that can  leverage each of their respective strengths to develop comprehensive content. The output from  these teams will be multi-disciplinary curricula content that will contain elements of privacy  technologies, user requirements, user psychology and legal, economic and policy frameworks for  privacy. The privacy initiative will seek to engage faculties in privacy topics that are cross-cutting i.e.:  data protection; privacy policies and regulations; legal frameworks for privacy, economics of privacy;  regional differences in privacy; usability and user adoption, information usage models. But the  programme also has a technology focus i.e.: privacy-preserving protocols and architectures; re- identification and other privacy attacks; privacy by design; user-controlled privacy models; and  Public Private Partnerships in Network and Information Security Education  Case studies  October 2014  Page 26  privacy support in low-power devices. The first funded faculty team under this new initiative was  with MIT Professor Daniel Weitzner (Law/Internet public policy) with co-authors Hal Abelson  (Computer Science) and Michael Fischer (Anthropology) for multi-disciplinary, cross-cultural  perspectives on information privacy. The objective of this work is to develop curriculum content  aimed at providing CS undergraduates with a cross-disciplinary and cross-cultural perspective on  privacy. Additionally, this grant ties in collaborations with universities in Brazil, UK and the  Netherlands.  In conclusion, the above-funded faculty and their content areas are important topic areas and  students with those skills would be desired by the industry. Intel’s Security/Privacy Curriculum  Initiative focuses on stimulating the formation of an academic community to develop and share  content knowledge, which addresses student learning needs by providing the foundation for needed  skills and the tools of tomorrow.  Public Private Partnerships in Network and Information Security Education  Case studies  October 2014  Page 27  Public Private Partnerships in Network and Information Security Education  Case studies  October 2014  Page 28  4 Conclusions  This report has highlighted some optimal measures for working in public-private partnerships for  network and information-security education. It also provides an example of ENISA’s role in brokerage  between stakeholders and achieving coordination.  To conclude, we take the opportunity to emphasise some of the learning points from these case  studies, points that we will use and share with our communities. All these should be tackled by  universities around Europe, supported by national authorities from Member States together with  ENISA and EC, but also interested stakeholders from industry.  1. EU and national policy makers should ensure that current education approaches are  enhanced by a set of actions to improve cybersecurity know-how in the whole of society, and  security should be incorporated as a supporting theme that plays throughout the computing  curriculum;  2. Schools and institutes offering higher education should ensure that research and education  programmes holistically integrate the perspectives of technology, information, organisations,  business and people;  3. Eductaors should consider deploying a blended learning model, which combines classroom  instruction with online curricula, interactive tools, hands-on activities and online assessments  to provide immediate feedback;  4. Find better ways of working directly with the community in creative ways, advocacy work and  empowering the users;  5. Use as a case study the Finnish model of Triple Helix Cooperation: business, academia and  public authorities.  The priority for this area of work can be read in the EU Cybersecurity Strategy and also in the key  impact indicators for NIS Education at ENISA, namely:  Stepping up the national effort on network and information security education  and training are the main priorities!

THINK. CONNECT.  Week 1 aims to raise online safety awareness among all Americans and reinforce STOP.  THINK. CONNECT. and the simple measures that everyone should take to be safer and more  secure online.  Week 2: 6–10 October 2014  Theme: Secure Development of IT Products  Building security into information technology products is key to enhanced cybersecurity.  Security is an essential element of software design, development, testing and maintenance.  The software that we use every day on our phones, tablets and computers may have  vulnerabilities that can compromise our personal information and privacy. This week will  target these stakeholders and educate others about what to do and look for in products.  Week 3: 13–17 October  2014  Theme: Critical Infrastructure and The Internet of Things  The Internet underlies nearly every facet of our daily lives and is the foundation for much of  the critical infrastructure that keeps our nation running. The systems that support  electricity, financial services, transport and communications are increasingly  interconnected. The Internet of Things — the ability of objects and devices to transfer data  — is changing the way that we use technology. Week Four highlights the importance of  protecting critical infrastructure and properly securing all devices that are connected to the  Internet.  Week 4: 20–24 October 2014  Theme: Cyber Security for Small and Medium-Sized Businesses and Entrepreneurs  Small and medium-sized businesses are an important part of our nation’s economy, but they  often do not see themselves as a target for a cyber attack. Strong cybersecurity practices are  vital within these organisations. Entrepreneurs are recognising the cybersecurity field as a  burgeoning marketplace. This week will focus on what emerging and established businesses  can do to protect their organisations, customers and employees, as well as cybersecurity as  a business opportunity using tools such as the DHS C3 Voluntary Programme.  Week 5: 27–31 October 2014  Theme: Cyber Crime and Law Enforcement  This week will help to draw awareness to, and educate law enforcement officers about, how  to assist their communities in combating cyber crime and educate the general public with  ways to protect themselves from becoming a victim of identity theft, fraud, phishing and  other crimes.

Feedback and Testimonials:  ‘Thank you so much! We learned very important info and had great discussions! Thank you!’  Sharonville Elementary, Cincinnati, OH, USA  ‘This programme really helps me to think about safety and I now have a great opportunity to create  some family rules at home.’Parent @ Security Summer Seminar for kids and families, Tokyo, Japan  ‘All the classes showed a considerable interest in the lessons carried out, following with attention to  both explanations proposed, presentations and movies. Many students asked specific questions. Each  student was given a booklet for further study or as a reminder. Overall, the initiative was very  interesting, precise and careful and the assessment can only be very positive. The increasingly valuable  collaboration between schools and local resources in order to constantly improve the provision of  training for the benefit of all the participants should be emphasised. Trusting in continuity over the  years of this particular project, we express gratitude and appreciation to the organisers for the valid  proposal, for their efforts, for the materials received and for their ongoing support.’ Dirigente  Scolastico, Scuola Media Statale Peyron, Italy  ‘Social networking plays such a big part in young people’s lives and this is what attracted us to ‘What’s  Your Story’. It is very relevant and very real to young people everywhere. We really do need to raise  more awareness about online safety and responsibility and are very proud that our film will be used as  future educational material too.’Siobhan Fitzgerald, (teacher) & overall winner of What’s Your story,  Ireland  ‘The What’s Your Story competition gives young people the opportunity and the space to consider how  their Internet use affects them personally. Webwise.ie is very proud to be associated with an initiative  that encourages children to be creative and to express themselves freely on topics that are of great  importance to them. In the context of ubiquitous Internet access, it is vital that we implement  strategies such as this that focus on empowerment, prioritising critical thinking and engagement.’  Simon Grehan, National Centre for Technology in Education, Dublin City University, Ireland.  Public Private Partnerships in Network and Information Security Education  Case studies  October 2014  Page 34  ANNEX D  Available Course Modules  Below are course overviews from funded faculties:  Dusko Pavlovic (Royal Holloway, University of London), Social and economic processes for  information security  The course provides content to inform future security professionals, on one hand, about the  economic tools that address some of the needs for quantitative methodologies; and on the other  hand about methods to include security into economic and business analyses. The need for such  methods is increasingly felt among the security practitioners and stakeholders. This course brings  together some methods normally taught to the students of economics, with some methods normally  taught to the students of computer science.  Angela Sasse (University College London), Usable Security through Serious Games  The approach for engaging this faculty was teaching material to develop a game ‘Serious Game —  for our ‘People and Security’. This game is to help students understand the complex interactions  between technical and human elements in an organisation, business processes and information  security policies and mechanisms, and information security risks and organisational strategies for  making a profit. The aim is to enable students to identify information security risks in a specific  organisational context, and manage them in a way that fits with the organisation’s business goals,  processes and culture. Additionally, this game helps students to learn about complex interactions  (by showing hidden costs, and the side and downstream effects of deploying security mechanisms),  and increases student motivation because the game adds fun and competitive elements. Students  will play parts of the game in single-player mode to acquire the basic concepts, but the application  to specific organisational scenarios will be a multi-player game.  Michael Huth (Imperial College London) Integrating Security Protocols into the Curriculum  The teaching materials developed in this area of security were based on protocol design and  validation, which students can then use in order to acquire skills and competencies in modelling and  analysing such protocols through the active use of bespoke formal methods tools.  Ingrid Verbauwhede (KU Leuven), Secure Embedded Circuits and Systems  We developed a set of courses focused on Secure Embedded Circuits and Systems. Here a traditional  circuit designer typically has to balance three optimisation goals: area, throughput and  power/energy consumption. However making the implementation of cryptographic algorithms and  components physically secure adds a fourth optimisation goal. The circuit implementation also has  to resist physical attacks, both active and passive attacks. The curriculum also contains hands-on  experiments and lab sessions to introduce students to the challenges that they will be facing in  developing new embedded ICT circuits/systems.  N. Asokan (University of Helsinki) Mobile Platform Security  The faculty created two new courses on security technologies for advanced Computer Science  students. Software Security: the motivation behind this course, when the industry recruits new CS  graduates to work on software projects, they usually need to provide in-house training on selected  software security aspects. The objective of this course was to expose students to  Public Private Partnerships in Network and Information Security Education  Case studies  October 2014  Page 35  Software security methodologies that are widely used in the industry. The next course was Mobile  (Platform) Security: The objective of this course was to provide students with the background  necessary to carry out graduate-level research in mobile platform security.  Aleksy Schubert (University of Warsaw), Constructing Trusted Code Base  The support to this faculty created a new course on security technologies for advanced Computer  Science students. Constructing Trusted Code Base (TCB): The objective for this course was to provide  students with the basic information concerning the TCB and contemporary methods to construct  such software and combine it with hardware platforms. Further, material was provided to students  with an understanding of the main cryptographic schemes currently in use and the associated  challenges in applying these schemes.  Jean-Pierre Seifert (TU Berlin), Embedded System Security Course Development  This course looks at integrated course modules on embedded system security and addresses areas  such as common software security problems and what are their underlying causes. Further it will  bring students’ attention to techniques, guidelines and principles, and tools to prevent or detect  security problems such as buffer overflows, integer overflows, SQL injection, XSS and race  conditions. They will develop skills and techniques to prevent or detect problems including threat  modelling, check lists and coding standards, static analysis tools, code reviews, typing, static analysis,  language-based security (or platform-based security), security middleware, runtime monitoring,  information flow analysis, programme verification and proof-carrying code.

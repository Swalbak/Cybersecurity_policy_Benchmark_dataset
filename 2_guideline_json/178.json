This documents presents  recommendations for safeguarding the technologies used for telework and remote access.  The public comment period is open through October 30, 2020. See the planned objectives (below) for  updating the SP. Please submit your comments to telework@nist.gov. Note that all comments are  subject to release under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA).  Background  Originally published in 2002, SP 800-46 was most recently updated in 2016. Work-from-home and other  forms of telework—performing work from locations other than an employer’s facilities—have been on  the rise for some time, but sharply increased in 2020 because of the COVID-19 pandemic. For many,  telework is now the only way to get work done, and the original concept of \"telework\" has evolved into  being able to work anytime, anywhere.  https://csrc.nist.gov/publications https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fcontent.csrc.e1c.nist.gov%2Fpublications%2Fdetail%2Fsp%2F800-46%2Frev-3%2Fdraft https://twitter.com/share?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcontent.csrc.e1c.nist.gov%2Fpublications%2Fdetail%2Fsp%2F800-46%2Frev-3%2Fdraft https://csrc.nist.gov/ mailto:%20telework@nist.gov?Subject=Comments%20on%20Guide%20to%20Enterprise%20Telework%20Security https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800-46/rev-2/final mailto:telework@nist.gov  SP 800-46 Rev. 3 (Draft), Call for Comments: Guide to Enterprise Telework Security | CSRC  https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800-46/rev-3/draft 2/4  The technologies used for telework have also evolved since 2016. Examples of this include the ubiquity  of mobile devices, the expectation to be able to access information from anywhere at any time, and the  highly distributed nature of data and apps across end user devices, data centers, and clouds. Telework  and zero-trust architecture may even be converging in the near future.  All of these recent changes are affecting cybersecurity and privacy risks, and organizations need to be  aware of and manage these risks. Accordingly, NIST is soliciting public feedback on this Special  Publication to identify areas that industry, government, and others deem most important to revise or  add. NIST would also like suggestions of existing resources related to telework cybersecurity and  privacy that could help inform the update of SP 800-46. Please send all comments to  telework@nist.gov.  Community of Interest  NIST is also building a community of interest so that interested individuals and organizations can follow  the progress of NIST telework cybersecurity and privacy publications and can provide input on them.  To join the community of interest, please send a request to telework@nist.gov.  Planned Updates  Reviewers are welcome to comment and suggest changes and enhancements to any parts of the  publication. We are particularly interested in comments on our planned objectives for updating SP 800-  46, which are listed in the table below along with the high-level changes each objective is intended to  address. Reviewers are encouraged to provide feedback on the contents of the table, citing the relevant  objectives and changes by number and letter, respectively. After we review all comments and finalize  the table, it will serve as the basis of determining what needs to be revised in SP 800-46 and other NIST  publications on telework cybersecurity and privacy.  Objective High-Level Changes to Address  Objective 1: Reflect  changes in how  telework is performed.  a. More people are teleworking, many of whom haven’t teleworked  before.  b. Many people are teleworking for extended periods of time, with  neither the people nor their devices necessarily visiting the  organization’s facilities during that time.  c. Mobile device usage has increased, and mobile devices can do much  more than they used to.  d. Teleworkers frequently use services not controlled by the  organization, such as ad hoc file sharing, instant messaging/chat,  and teleconferencing and videoconferencing services.  e. Organization-controlled and personally-owned technologies are  increasingly intermingled.  f. Telework is more often occurring from networks shared with  potentially compromised Internet of Things (IoT) devices.  g. By default, the networks that the devices are connected to are  untrusted and exposed to malicious attacks.  mailto:telework@nist.gov mailto:telework@nist.gov?subject=Telework%20Cybersecurity%20and%20Privacy%20Community%20of%20Interest  SP 800-46 Rev. 3 (Draft), Call for Comments: Guide to Enterprise Telework Security | CSRC  https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800-46/rev-3/draft 3/4  Objective High-Level Changes to Address  Objective 2: Reflect  changes in the role of  remote access  technologies.  a. The migration to cloud-based applications and services has  degraded traditional perimeter-based security models.  b. A smaller percentage of telework traffic is passing over an  organization’s networks unless that traffic is specifically tunneled  through those networks, so organizations are losing visibility and  control.  c. Device and access provisioning occur away from the organization’s  facilities.  d. Many organizations are adopting zero-trust principles.  Objective 3: Update all  references and  mappings to  references.  a. The NIST Cybersecurity Framework and SP 800-53 publications have  been updated since the last SP 800-46 revision, so their mappings are  out of date.  b. The NIST Privacy Framework has been released since the last SP 800-  46 revision, so mappings to it could be added to SP 800-46.  c. Several other NIST publications with related material have been  created or updated since the last SP 800-46 revision (e.g., SP 800-124  for mobile device security, SP 800-207 for zero-trust architecture, SP  800-77 for IPsec, SP 800-52 for TLS).  Objective 4: Shorten  SP 800-46 to improve  its readability.  a. Some of the existing material is already widely known by today’s  readers or is no longer relevant to most readers, so it could be  condensed, deleted, or moved to auxiliary publications.  b. There may be content in SP 800-46 that is also covered in other NIST  publications, so removing such material and pointing readers to the  other NIST publications would shorten SP 800-46 and ensure readers  are seeing the latest content on the topics.  c. There are additional telework topics to address, like teleconferencing  / videoconferencing security practices or secure file transfer  technologies, but they are discrete and evolving. It is unclear how  much of this new content should be added to SP 800-46 versus  producing separate documents on individual topics.

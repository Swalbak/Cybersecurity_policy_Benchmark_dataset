The Directive  states that each Member State shall designate one or more CSIRTs that shall comply with a set of defined  high-level requirements.  In order to provide input to the designated CSIRTs on this topic, ENISA contracted  a study on the maturity aspects for this type of CSIRTs, narrowed down to the national teams expected to  join the CSIRT network – the results of which are presented here.  The study takes all relevant information sources into account, with a special emphasis on the NIS Directive,  the various ENISA reports on CSIRT capabilities, maturity and metrics, and on the SIM3 maturity model for  CSIRTs which is a best practice document widely used in Europe, but also outside.  The first lesson learnt is that a sustainable and implementable approach towards assessing and improving  maturity is best based on a measurable set of quantities, or parameters. The SIM3 model as is commonly  used in Europe serves as an excellent basis for this, with some additions based on especially the NIS  Directive requirements.  The second lesson learnt is that the three-tier approach towards maturity levels that ENISA adopted in the  2013 report ‘CERT community - Recognition mechanisms and schemes’ can be used to define three levels  when adopting the SIM3 maturity model to assess CSIRT maturity: basic, intermediate and advanced.  The report specifies a proposed definition of those three levels for the benefit of the CSIRT Network  created by the NIS Directive, coupled with a validation process based on self-assessments and peer- assessments. No actual certification is prescribed, however the highest level advanced has been defined at  the level of the existing CSIRT Certification scheme in Europe, which means that certification is within  reach once that maturity level has been reached.  By adopting the proposed approach, the CSIRT Network will have immediate access to a clearly laid out  CSIRT maturity improvement process, that is both implementable and sustainable. A growth path is  suggested that reaches basic level within one year, intermediate two years later and advanced another  two years later: a total of five years maximum. Basic level already allows a minimum of successful co- operation between teams on incident handling, the higher levels are needed to allow the members of the  CSIRT network to interact on all levels, including pro-actively, thus truly giving meaning to the word CSIRT  Network.  ENISA CSIRT maturity assessment model  Final| External | 30 April 2019  06  1. Introduction  The EU Network and Information Security Directive (NIS Directive) aims to create a CSIRT Network “to  contribute to developing confidence and trust between the Member States and to promote swift and  effective operational cooperation”. [1] The Directive states that each Member State shall designate one or  more CSIRTs which shall comply with the requirements set out in the Directive’s point (1) of Annex I  (requirements), covering at least the sectors referred to in Annex II and the services referred to in Annex  III, responsible for risk and incident handling in accordance with a well–defined process. The Directive gives  high-level requirements that designated CSIRTs must observe, and tasks that they must perform. In order  to provide input to the designated CSIRTs on this topic, ENISA has contracted a study on CSIRTs capabilities  and parameters that represent teams’ maturity for this type of CSIRTs. For the purpose of this study the  designated CSIRT was defined as the national CSIRT. The results of this study are presented here.  ENISA CSIRT maturity assessment model  Final| External | 30 April 2019  07  2. Methodology  The work in this project focused on the maturity aspects of the CSIRT portfolio. Initially, stock- taking of  currently existing and used assessment parameters and recommendations or good practices to evaluate  CSIRT maturity (capabilities) in Europe was performed – the CSIRT maturity model SIM3 (see 2.1) was a  specially important source of such parameters. The result of that stock-taking was the identification of  areas where assessment parameters are not yet optimally defined or tailored to the needs of national  CSIRTs (according to the NISD and its obligations for dedicated CSIRTs). The outcome of the project  elaborates on these areas and parameters that have to be considered when the national CSIRTs build their  national CSIRT capabilities according to the NIS Directive obligations and/or when a national CSIRT wants  to improve their maturity and prepare for the existing certification. The results presented will build upon  the ENISA reports: CSIRT Capabilities: how to assess maturity? Guidelines for national and governmental  CSIRTs (2015) – and – CERT community - Recognition mechanisms and schemes (2013).  Input sources  Input was considered from the following areas:  1. The above-mentioned ENISA reports CSIRT Capabilities: how to assess maturity? Guidelines for  national and governmental CSIRTs [2] – and – CERT community - Recognition mechanisms and schemes  [3]  2. SIM3 model for CSIRT self-assessment and certification (generic evaluation scheme for any type of  CSIRT) [4]  3. Further ENISA baseline capabilities recommendations for national and governmental CSIRTs in Europe  (specific recommendations for national and governmental type of CSIRT) [5]  4. NIS Directive – tasks and requirements of the dedicated (national) CSIRT (obligations for national  (dedicated) CSIRT in the European Union [6]  5. GFCE CSIRT Maturity Kit [7]  6. Recommendations towards the use of SIM3 by members of the Nippon CSIRT Association [8]  7. FIRST Site Visit Requirements and Assessment [9]  Input evaluation  ENISA jointly worked with the contractor on assessing and structuring the input sources, especially the  ENISA baseline capabilities documents and the NISD. After extensive mapping and visualisation of all  aspects and parameters involved, it was concluded that mapping all of these onto the SIM3 architecture  proved to be a highly workable approach. This allowed us to research all existing SIM3 parameters, and  relate them with the NISD, ENISA documents and all other sources of input and come to recommendations  as to how NISD and ENISA baseline capabilities can be translated into a sustainable system of measurable  parameters, on which a progress in CSIRT maturity can be based.  ENISA CSIRT maturity assessment model  Final| External | 30 April 2019  08  3. Maturity Approaches  This chapter shortly re-iterates important approaches towards the topic of CSIRT maturity and concludes  with a proposal how to combine these in one sustainable approach.  ENISA  3.1.1 CERT community - Recognition mechanisms and schemes  In ENISA’s 2013 document CERT community - Recognition mechanisms and schemes, there is an analysis of  various approaches worldwide in regard the topic of CSIRT maturity. One of the document’s main features  is the proposal of a three-tier CERT maturity model:  Summary Characteristics Organisation/mechanisms  Tier 1 Fundamental  (Essential,  indispensable)  CERT is being established and  trying to earn recognition in the  CERT community (based on  individual trust building).  ENISA: A Step-by-Step Approach on  How to Set up a CSIRT (2006)  ENISA: Baseline Capabilities for  National / Governmental CERTs –  operational aspects (2009)  ENISA: Map of CERTs and Inventory  of CERT Activities in Europe (2005,  constantly updated)  TF-CSIRT/TI: ‘Listed’ status  Tier 2 Baseline  (Steady, Sure- Footed)  CERT has baseline capabilities  (operations) in place and its team  representative gained trust among  the CERT community.  ENISA: Baseline Capabilities for  National/ Governmental CERTs –  Policy recommendations (2010,  2012)  IETF: RFC-2350 (2003 update)   TF-CSIRT/TI: ‘Accreditation’   FIRST: ‘Full Membership’   APCERT: ‘Membership’   CERT/CC: Handbook for Computer  Security Incident Response Teams  (CSIRTs) (2003)  Tier 3 Advanced  (Stable, Well-  Balanced)  CERT has a complete set of  capabilities in place and has  established a stable place in the  community (no longer dependent  on individuals from the team).  ENISA: n/g CERT standard  capabilities mechanism (2014)  ISO: ISO 27035 (2011 update)  TF-CSIRT/TI: ‘Certification’  ENISA CSIRT maturity assessment model  Final| External | 30 April 2019  09  These capabilities are all  documented.  This model is then further analysed on the basis of 8 assessment categories:  1. Type of approach (organisation)  2. Requirements for CERTs  3. Validation process  4. CERTs’ focus: type and region  5. Benefits and added value of the mechanism  6. Definitions and terminology  7. Keeping the mechanism up to date  8. Promoting the mechanism and CERTs' training  And finally an important conclusion is reached, quoted here:  The number of mechanisms that exist for use by CERTs suggests that there may be room for harmonisation  of certain aspects of these mechanisms. Targeted harmonisation could benefit both the organisations that  offer mechanisms and CERTs that use them. For CERTs, harmonisation of these mechanisms can make it  easier for them to associate with more CERT community organisations that offer these mechanisms. From  the perspective of these CERT community organisations, harmonisation could enable cooperation with  other similar organisations, and allow them to more easily make use of each other's existing resources. All  of these potential advantages are about possible gained efficiencies, which is important given that these  mechanisms should be about helping CERTs reach higher stages of maturity and better serve their  constituents.  The 2013 document identifies several areas of possible harmonisation. Two of them stand out in the  context of this report:   Requirements for CERTs   Validation process  3.1.2 CSIRT Capabilities: how to assess maturity? Guidelines for national and governmental CSIRTs  ENISA’s 2015 document CSIRT Capabilities: how to assess maturity? Guidelines for national and  governmental CSIRTs [2] aims to be a guiding tool for national and governmental CSIRTs which are  considering to improve their maturity. It builds on the ENISA document discussed in 3.1.1. It starts with  noting that in Europe the predominantly used maturity scheme is that of the Trusted Introducer, which  essentially coincides with the three-tier model described in 3.1.1, and offers the levels:  1. Listing – the team is operational and contact information is available to other teams.  2. Accreditation – the team is fully functional, services are defined according to RFC2350, etc.  3. Certification – the team has reached an appropriate level of maturity.  The ENISA document then goes on to explain how the SIM3 CSIRT maturity model is the benchmark model  for Certification – but is also a very suitable tool for self-assessments of CSIRTs with the aim of improving  maturity.  The SIM3 model is explained. It consists of 44 parameters; quantities that are measured in regard maturity.  Each parameter belongs to one of the following categories:  ENISA CSIRT maturity assessment model  Final| External | 30 April 2019  10   O- Organisation   H – Human   T – Tools   P - Processes  These categories have been chosen in such a way that the parameters in there are as mutually  independent as possible. What SIM3 measures are the levels for each parameter. Simplicity has been  reached by specifying a unique set of levels, valid for all of the parameters in all of the categories:   0 = not available / undefined / unaware   1 = implicit (known/considered but not written down, “between the ears”)   2 = explicit, internal (written down but not formalised in any way)   3 = explicit, formalised on authority of CSIRT head (“rubberstamped” or published)   4 = explicit, actively assessed on authority of governance levels above the CSIRT management on a  regular basis (subject to control process/review)  The ENISA document then goes on to detail all 44 parameters and comments on how they work in the  everyday CSIRT practice in Europe – as various teams use SIM3 and several have been Certified based on  the same model. An important conclusion reached is:  In general, national and governmental CSIRTs must reach a higher maturity level and improve in order to  cope with the evolving cyberspace and its threats and vulnerabilities. The SIM3 model can be used as a tool  to assist in this process as well as to obtain an independent evaluation of CSIRT capabilities.  EU NIS Directive  On 6 July 2016, the Directive on security of network and information systems (the NIS Directive, referred  to here as NISD) was adopted by the European Parliament. Article 9 of NISD states:  Each Member State shall designate one or more CSIRTs which shall comply with the requirements set out in  point (1) of Annex I, covering at least the sectors referred to in Annex II and the services referred to in  Annex III, responsible for risk and incident handling in accordance with a well-defined process. A CSIRT may  be established within a competent authority.  And NISD continues to state that:   The CSIRTS have adequate resources to effectively carry out their tasks   Member States shall ensure the effective, efficient and secure cooperation of their CSIRTs   Member States shall ensure that their CSIRTs have access to an appropriate, secure, and resilient  communication and information infrastructure at national level   Member States shall inform the Commission about the remit, as well as the main elements of the  incident- handling process, of their CSIRTs   Member States may request the assistance of ENISA in developing national CSIRTs  Annex I of NISD is labelled REQUIREMENTS AND TASKS OF COMPUTER SECURITY INCIDENT RESPONSE  TEAMS (CSIRTs) and is quoted here in full because of its great relevance for the national/governmental  CSIRT community inside the EU:  ENISA CSIRT maturity assessment model  Final| External | 30 April 2019  11  (1)  Requirements for CSIRTs:  (a)  CSIRTs shall ensure a high level of availability of their communications services by avoiding  single points of failure, and shall have several means for being contacted and for contacting others  at all times. Furthermore, the communication channels shall be clearly specified and well known to  the constituency and cooperative partners.    (b)  CSIRTs' premises and the supporting information systems shall be located in secure sites.    (c)  Business continuity:  (i)  CSIRTs shall be equipped with an appropriate system for managing and routing  requests, in order to facilitate handovers.    (ii)  CSIRTs shall be adequately staffed to ensure availability at all times.    (iii)  CSIRTs shall rely on an infrastructure the continuity of which is ensured. To that end,  redundant systems and backup working space shall be available.    (d)  CSIRTs shall have the possibility to participate, where they wish to do so, in international  cooperation networks.    (2)  CSIRTs' tasks:  (a)  CSIRTs' tasks shall include at least the following:  (i)  monitoring incidents at a national level;    (ii)  providing early warning, alerts, announcements and dissemination of information to  relevant stakeholders about risks and incidents;    (iii)  responding to incidents;    (iv)  providing dynamic risk and incident analysis and situational awareness;    (v)  participating in the CSIRTs network.    (b)  CSIRTs shall establish cooperation relationships with the private sector.    (c)  To facilitate cooperation, CSIRTs shall promote the adoption and use of common or  standardised practices for:    (i) incident and risk-handling procedures;   (ii) incident, risk and information classification schemes.  Assessing and improving CSIRT maturity based on measurable parameters  The project team evaluated in depth all input as referred to in section 2.1, and gave special significance to  the ENISA documents discussed in section 3.1 and to the NISD discussed in section 3.2.  ENISA CSIRT maturity assessment model  Final| External | 30 April 2019  12  Based on that evaluation the following conclusions stand out:  1. A sustainable and implementable approach towards assessing and improving maturity is best based on  a measurable set of quantities, or parameters. The SIM3 model as is commonly used in Europe serves  as an excellent basis for this, with some additions based on especially the NISD requirements, and on  recent insights as e.g. formulated by ENISA in their 2015 report on this topic1.  2. A three-tier approach towards maturity levels is recognised both by ENISA and by TF-CSIRT/Trusted  Introducer, the European cooperation body of all types of CSIRTs. It is possible to tie that in to the  SIM3 maturity model by introducing, again, three levels of increasing maturity. For the sake of this  report these levels have been labelled basic, intermediate and advanced – the latter, most mature,  level connecting with the existing CSIRT Certification scheme in Europe. It is important to note that no  exact 1:1 mapping between these three levels and the older schemes is proposed here – but rather a  unified, sustainable approach meant to serve especially the “CSIRT Network” required by the NISD.  The next chapter details this proposed approach.  1 SIM3 in its current version was essentially written in 2009 – since then there were only minor updates. A revision of  SIM3 towards “version 2” is currently being undertaken, the results of which are expected in 2017. Arguably, the  outcomes reached in this report will be important input for that revision, which is expected to even more increase  the already strong alignment between the recommendations of this report and the SIM3 maturity model.  ENISA CSIRT maturity assessment model  Final| External | 30 April 2019  13  4. Sustainable three-tier maturity approach:  how to become a mature team?  The maturity of a CSIRT can only grow by performing the tasks assigned to the team combined with a  culture of continuous improvement, supported by proper education and training. Also, policies,  procedures and workflows that support the team’s goals and tasks, must be in place and need to have  been polished by real life application. As all of that, and more, is required in order to be considered a  mature team, this clearly requires that the team has been operating long enough to allow that kind of  reliance on their own merits.  The question that comes up is: what all is needed to become a mature team?  This chapter will answer this question and provide a process that enables each team – both experienced  and new ones – to set and reach their maturity goals over time.  Applicability and Requirements  What we have considered so far does in fact apply to many types of CSIRTs. To increase maturity has  become an essential requirement for capacity building, and for a reliable and proven cooperation between  teams.  Clearly, all teams that operate on a national scale or with a national scope, even if only responsible for one  sector, need to be mature enough to be reliable partners in the CSIRT cooperation. This is especially true  for those teams that have been assigned the role of national CSIRT, designated CSIRT or defined point of  contact according to the NISD. But also, any government and military teams including those on the state  level within federated structures can be expected to adhere to the same principles.  In all cases it is essential that the teams to which these considerations apply, are well integrated in the  existing CSIRT communities. Some of the teams are by definition part of the CSIRT network established by  the NISD, but this network is not open to all CSIRTs and it covers only a small part of the globally active  teams. Accreditation by TF-CSIRT / Trusted Introducer inside Europe, and FIRST membership globally, are  therefore considered evolutionary steps for teams in increasing their maturity. In addition, especially  teams with a national scope or role, must be active and supportive members of their national CSIRT  community, as this is laying the foundation for a trusted and reliable CSIRT co-operation inside any given  country.  Introducing levels of maturity  As stated in the introduction, it is important to achieve a gradual improvement of operational experience  of teams and their maturity. Depending on the team’s budget, and on the resources dedicated to  establishing maturity, the speed with which different teams manage to reach the desired level of reliability  will vary. Other factors like the experience of the staff, the turn-over rate of staff members and the budget  attributed to trainings and exercises, are important too as much of the operational excellence of any team  resides in their staff.  Past experience has shown that the number of different parameters can be overwhelming, especially for  new teams that are planning to prepare for maturity or are limited in the budget available for  improvement, while handling day-to-day business and responding to incidents of national interest. To  ENISA CSIRT maturity assessment model  Final| External | 30 April 2019  14  overcome this uncertainty and provide for a maturity program allowing the teams to advance in their own  speed but while doing so addressing the most important issues first, we introduce three levels of maturity:   Basic Maturity Level – For this level, activities on all parameters have been started with a clear focus  on the mandate and other formal considerations of the team’s role. Approximately 80% of the  organisational parameters have already been addressed to such a degree, that they can be considered  “advanced”.   Intermediate Maturity Level – Based on the work done so far, progress for all parameters, except for  those already on “advanced” level, has been achieved. Overall, approximately 50% of the human, tool  and process parameters can be considered “advanced”.   Advanced Maturity Level – The final step directs the efforts to the remaining parameters and achieves  a level that is considered “advanced”.  As we will explain, the demands for maturity for teams co-operating in the CSIRT Network as defined by  the NIS Directive is somewhat higher than for the current Trusted Introducer (TI) Certification [10]. This  implies that all teams that are on the “advanced maturity level” can become a TI certified team by applying  for it. Due to the set-up of the TI Certification, which is based on a formal process with independent  assessments, this may still cause some effort – but this should be limited, as the content covered and the  ratings applied are the same.  Assuming that all teams to be considered have already been accredited by the TI, we have used this as the  starting point and will focus on the additional efforts to reach the next levels. In the following sections we  will examine the four areas of parameters – Organisation, Human, Tools, Processes – for each of the three  maturity levels. At the start of each sub-section a table will show the requirements in colour coding. The  table below shows an example:  The previous/current level in this example is “Basic”, the desired level is “Intermediate”. Already at “Basic”  level, the parameter X-2 is on the “Advanced” level, indicated by the dark blue background and white font.  All other parameters from the previous/current level have a light background and black font.  In order to advance to the next level “Intermediate”, the team needs to substantiate the level for the  factors X-1, X-3 and X-4. Three different colours are used here to differentiate:   Parameter X-1 is pushed to the “Advanced” level, indicated by the dark blue background and white  font.   Parameter X-3 stays on the same level and does not require further work. Therefore, the light  background and black font are used for this as before, indicating “no change”.   Parameter X-4 improves, but not yet to “Advanced” level, shown by the light blue background and  black font.  X-1 X-2 X-3 X-4  Basic 3  3 1 1  Intermediate 4 3  1  2  ENISA CSIRT maturity assessment model  Final| External | 30 April 2019  15  Maturity Level: Basic – how to get the basics right  Specific organisational decisions are necessary with the creation of any new CSIRT. But such decisions are  most important if national CSIRTs are set up according to the NIS Directive. Therefore, the focus of  reaching the Basic Maturity Level lies on these parameters. But as it is not enough to produce the proper  documentation and organisational set-up, work on the other parameters will start.  4.3.1 Basic Maturity Level : Why  For the CSIRT network to function at a basic level covering at least the co-ordinated handling of incidents,  it is necessary that the CSIRTs involved have a minimum foundation in terms of their existence (mandate  etc.), are reachable and have a basic incident handling process. The Basic Maturity Level focuses on  achieving this. The organisational parameters will already reach a fair level of maturity (mostly 3) with this  level, while the majority of the other parameters are only level 1 or 2.  As starting point to reach Basic Maturity Level, we use the TI accreditation.2 This system which has existed  for 15 years in Europe, provides a minimal baseline for information that teams should make accessible to  other community members in regard their organisation and operation. We found that, within the EU  realm, more than 90% of all national CSIRTs or government teams with national scope have already been  accredited. This shows that the TI accreditation is well accepted and has indeed become a best practice in  and of itself.  Compared to other baselines like FIRST membership, the TI accreditation is fully documented  and transparent for all participants. It does not rely on a subjective site visit which is carried out in very  different ways determined only by the visiting team vouching for the visited team, as happens for FIRST  membership. Considering all this, the TI Accreditation provides the deterministic and uniquely shared  common viewpoint that serves as the best point to start from.  4.3.2 Organisational Parameters  To provide the foundation of a reliable service, the following organisational parameters need to be  documented for external consumption and approved/set into force by the team management. Without  this no defined basis for the team’s mission would be available:   O-1: Mandate   O-2: Constituency   O-3: Authority   O-4: Responsibility   O-5: Service Description   O-7: Service Level Description   O-9: Participation in existing CERT Frameworks   O-10: Organisational Framework  The parameters O-7 and O-10 will not require further work, as it is not expected that all Service Levels will  be actively assessed by higher management, and the Organisational Framework – most often referred to  as “CSIRT Handbook” – is not designated to be necessarily published or become widely distributed. Both  factors however require to be enforced internally by the team management.  2 https://www.trusted-introducer.org/processes/accreditation.html  https://www.trusted-introducer.org/processes/accreditation.html  ENISA CSIRT maturity assessment model  Final| External | 30 April 2019  16  For the two remaining parameters at least some consensus on the team level has to be reached. While it  seems rather unlikely that this will not require some sort of documentation to be used consistently such  requirements have been postponed to further levels.   O-8: Incident Classification   O-11: Security Policy  The table shows an overview of the initial values and the required improvements:3  O-1 O-2 O-3 O-4 O-5 O-7 O-8 O-9 O-10 O-11  Accreditation (3) (3) Opt.

Certainly the  escalation to the governance level needs to be well documented for external consumption and  approved/set into force by the team management:   P-1: Escalation to Governance level  Documentation is also required for five other parameters, although not yet for external consumption:   P-8: Process of active team assessment by higher management   P-9: Emergency Reachability Process   P-10: Common Mailbox Names   P-11: Secure Information Handling Process   P-14: Reporting Process  All other process related parameters are considered to be addressed in succeeding levels:   P-2: Press Escalation   P-3: Legal Escalation   P-4: Incident Prevention Process   P-5: Incident Detection Process   P-6: Incident Resolution Process   P-7: Specific Incident Processes   P-12: Information Sources Process   P-13: Outreach Process   P-15: Statistics Process   P-16: Meeting Process   P-17: Peer-to-Peer Process  T-1 T-2 T-3 T-4 T-5 T-6 T-7 T-8 T-9 T-10  Accreditation -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --  Basic  1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1  1  ENISA CSIRT maturity assessment model  Final| External | 30 April 2019  18  The tables show an overview of the initial values and the required improvements:  Maturity Level: Intermediate – how to advance  Based on the basis achieved by the previous efforts, the main focus now is to set up the management  control functions for the organisational parameters, pushing 8 of 10 parameters to the “Advanced” level.  The work on the other areas – Human, Tool, Process – is building on the previous work and ensures  progress on most parameters.  4.4.1 Intermediate Maturity Level : Why  For the CSIRT network to function reliably in regard the co-ordinated handling of incidents, and also allows  additional joint activities (like vulnerability handling), it is necessary that the CSIRTs involved reach a more  advanced maturity level than Basic, focusing on a mature foundation and decent descriptions of all  relevant tools, processes and human aspects. The Intermediate Maturity Level has been constructed to  achieve this. The organisational parameters will now already reach a high level of maturity (more than 50%  will be at level 4), the tool parameters will be at level 2, whereas the human and process parameters will  be at either level 2 or 3, depending on their relevance for the CSIRT network co-operation.  4.4.2 Organisational Parameters  The “Intermediate” level requires six more organisational parameters to become management controlled.  These are:   O-1: Mandate   O-2: Constituency   O-3: Authority   O-4: Responsibility   O-5: Service Description   O-9: Participation in existing CERT Frameworks  For the two remaining parameters for this level documentation is required:   O-8: Incident Classification   O-11: Security Policy  The table shows an overview of the initial values and the required improvements:  P-1 P-2 P-3 P-4 P-5 P-6 P-7 P-8 P-9 P-10  Accreditation  -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --  Basic 3 1 1 1 1 1 1 2 2  2  P-11 P-12 P-13 P-14 P-15 P-16 P-17  Accreditation -- -- -- -- -- -- --  Basic 2 1 1 2 1 1 1  O-1 O-2 O-3 O-4 O-5 O-7 O-8 O-9 O-10 O-11  Basic 3 3 3 3 3 3 1 3  3 1  Intermediate 4 4 4 4 4 3 2 4 3  2  ENISA CSIRT maturity assessment model  Final| External | 30 April 2019  19  4.4.3 Human Parameters  Summarizing the progress for these parameters is easy: advancements for all parameters. To already  started work on the documented parameters leads to documents that are documented for external  consumption and approved/set into force by the team management:   H-1: Code of Conduct/Practice/Ethics   H-2: Personal Resilience   H-7: External Networking  The other four parameters are now to be documented at least for internal use by the:   H-3: Skillset Description   H-4: Internal Training   H-5: External Technical Training   H-6: External Communication Training  The table shows an overview of the initial values and the required improvements:  4.4.4 Tools Parameters  Progress related to the tool parameters is achieved by providing proper documentation for internal use by  the team for:   T-2: Information Sources List   T-3: Consolidated E-Mail System   T-4: Incident Tracking System   T-5: Resilient Phone   T-6: Resilient E-Mail   T-7: Resilient Internet Access  Work on the following parameter is not yet required:   T-10: Incident Resolution Toolset  The table shows an overview of the initial values and the required improvements:  4.4.5 Process Parameters  Of the five documented (for internal use within the team) parameters only one (P-10: Common Mailbox  Names) will not need to be documented for external consumption and approved/set into force by the  team management:  H-1 H-2 H-3 H-4 H-5 H-6 H-7  Basic  2 2 1 1 1 1 2  Intermediate  3 3 2 2 2 2 3  T-1 T-2 T-3 T-4 T-5 T-6 T-7 T-8 T-9 T-10  Basic 1 1 1 1 1 1 1  1 1  1  Intermediate 1  2 2 2 2 2 2 1 1 1  ENISA CSIRT maturity assessment model  Final| External | 30 April 2019  20   P-8: Process of active team assessment by higher management   P-9: Emergency Reachability Process   P-11: Secure Information Handling Process   P-14: Reporting Process  The majority of not yet documented process related parameters are now considered to be required for  internal use by the team:   P-2: Press Escalation   P-3: Legal Escalation   P-4: Incident Prevention Process   P-5: Incident Detection Process   P-6: Incident Resolution Process   P-7: Specific Incident Processes   P-12: Information Sources Process   P-13: Outreach Process   P-15: Statistics Process  The last two processes still handled informally will need to be addressed before moving to the “Advanced”  level:   P-16: Meeting Process   P-17: Peer-to-Peer Process  The tables show an overview of the initial values and the required improvements:  Maturity Level: Advanced – how to reach the objective  While there are only some small efforts left for the organisational parameters by now, the focus of this  step is to finish the efforts for the other three areas – Human, Tool, Process – successfully.  4.5.1 Advanced Maturity Level : Why  For the CSIRT network to function excellently in regard the co-ordinated handling of incidents, and also  reliably supports additional joint activities like the sharing of threats and early-warning data, vulnerability  handling, it is necessary that the CSIRTs involved reach an advanced maturity level, beyond Intermediate,  focusing on well described, approved – and in various cases, actively assessed – processes, tools and  human aspects. The Advanced Maturity Level has been constructed to achieve this. The organisational  parameters were already at a high level with Intermediate, but now also all the human, tool and process  parameters will reach level 3, and in important cases even level 4.

This is however outside the scope  of this report. The TI Certification is the currently only existing certification scheme for CSIRTs, which is  operated by TF-CSIRT/TI in Europe. At this moment, the levels chosen in this report are equal to or exceed  in several cases the existing Certification demands. This is partially due to the fact that these demands  have been drawn up back in 2009, but also to the fact that the NISD invokes some stronger maturity  demands. The TF-CSIRT/TI Certification is currently under revision, to be concluded in 2017. It can be  expected that some of the demands will become more strict and in fact the standard set in this report is  expected to be close to that. In all cases, when a team reaches the Advanced level, and have done their  assessment well (see 4.6), it is to be expected that actual TI Certification – where the assessment is done  by means of independent, external review, should be within easy reach.  4.5.2 Organisation Parameters  For the final level the two remaining parameters for this level are now made available externally or  enforced by the team management:   O-8: Incident Classification   O-11: Security Policy  The table shows an overview of the initial values and the required improvements:  4.5.3 Human Parameters  Only the four parameters that until now have been required only to be documented for internal use have  to be improved. For the “Advanced” level they are required to be made available externally or enforced by  the team management:   H-3: Skillset Description   H-4: Internal Training   H-5: External Technical Training   H-6: External Communication Training  The table shows an overview of the initial values and the required improvements:  4.5.4 Tools  Parameters  Based on the proper documentation for internal use by the team produced at least for the “Intermediate”  level the “Advanced” level requires now documents that are made available externally or enforced by the  team management:   T-2: Information Sources List   T-3: Consolidated E-Mail System   T-4: Incident Tracking System  O-1 O-2 O-3 O-4 O-5 O-7 O-8 O-9 O-10 O-11  Intermediate 4 4 4 4 4 3 2 4 3  2  Advanced 4 4 4 4 4 3 3 4 3 3  H-1 H-2 H-3 H-4 H-5 H-6 H-7  Intermediate 3 3 2 2 2 2 3  Advanced 3 3 3 3 3 3 3  ENISA CSIRT maturity assessment model  Final| External | 30 April 2019  22   T-5: Resilient Phone   T-6: Resilient E-Mail   T-7: Resilient Internet Access  Work on the following parameter is also concluded by now resulting in the proper documentation:   T-10: Incident Resolution Toolset  The table shows an overview of the initial values and the required improvements:  4.5.5 Process Parameters  Two of the process parameters are considered to be of overriding importance for the perception and  success of the team’s operation. One describes the system by which the higher management actively  assesses the team, the other ensures the continuous improvement of the team’s operations. In addition  the reporting allowing the monitoring of the team’s performance as well as the assessment of current  trends and developments are key requirements. Both parameters therefore need to become enforced or  examined by an entity overseeing the team’s operation:   P-8: Review / Feedback Processes   P-14: Reporting Process  Of those parameters, that had been documented for internal use by the team the following six are now  required to be documented for external consumption and approved/set into force by the team  management:   P-2: Press Escalation   P-3: Legal Escalation   P-7: Specific Incident Processes   P-12: Information Sources Process   P-13: Outreach Process   P-15: Statistics Process  The last two processes still handled informally will need to be at least documented for internal use by the  team:   P-16: Meeting Process   P-17: Peer-to-Peer Process  The tables show an overview of the initial values and the required improvements:  T-1 T-2 T-3 T-4 T-5 T-6 T-7 T-8 T-9 T-10  Intermediate  1  2 2 2 2 2 2  1 1  1  Advanced 1 3 3 3 3 3 3 1 1 2  P-1 P-2 P-3 P-4 P-5 P-6 P-7 P-8 P-9 P-10  Intermediate 3 2 2  2 2 2  2 3 3 2  Advanced 3 3 3 2 2 2 3 4 3 2  P-11 P-12 P-13 P-14 P-15 P-16 P-17  ENISA CSIRT maturity assessment model  Final| External | 30 April 2019  23  Assessment  With any scheme established to allow a common approach towards increasing maturity, there needs to be  some mechanism to exchange related status information, and to ensure within the trust group accepting  those maturity levels, that such status information can be relied upon. Within the CSIRT communities,  specific “trust marks” have already been established, but it is certain that this new process supporting the  described maturity levels will establish another “trust mark”, as it builds on the existing maturity  assessment system (SIM3) yet comes with higher demands for national teams with critical tasks.  For this reason, it is necessary to define some kind of assessment that supports the new trust mark but is  anchored in the community itself. Two approaches that can be combined are recommended:  1. Self-Assessment – The SIM3 maturity model has been created as a model for self-assessments,  recognizing the basis needs for each team itself to determine its own level of success in advancing to a  more reliable and mature service-oriented entity.  2. Peer Review – By documenting the outcome of any self-assessment in a more formal and structured  document, the outcome authorized by the team’s management can be exchanged within the trusted  community. By exchanging this information, the team exposes itself but it does so to demonstrate that  trust can be placed on it.  As it was explained throughout this document there are limits that can be achieved by self-declaration. It  became obvious that requirements related to some parameters need to be assessed not by the team itself  but in an independent fashion. It is clear therefore, that the outcome of any self-assessment cannot  demonstrate in an objective way towards other teams that such an independent assessment is indeed in  place and functional. To overcome this gap, the peer review is an important step forward, even if not the  whole answer.  It is proposed that for all parameters requiring active assessment (level 4) the team needs to provide  evidence to its peers – the other teams – supporting the claim. If the claim is checked and approved, this  result can be recorded as part of the available status information.  Proposed Timeline  As said in the introduction of this chapter it will take some time to advance to a mature team. Due to the  reasons described maturity cannot be achieved by the simple will of anyone. You might compare it to the  situation of young people getting their driving license: They (finally) got the mandate/license and passed  all tests, so operationally they can drive and there is a justifiable hope that they will not do harm to others  or themselves. But others would not consider any such person a “mature” driver. For that much more  practice and experience is needed, enabling us to drive safely despite conditions that might be far from  optimal. The same is true for advancing to be a “mature” team.  Before you start  Intermediate 3 2 2 3 2 1 1  Advanced 3 3 3 4 3 2 2  ENISA CSIRT maturity assessment model  Final| External | 30 April 2019  24   Stock taking   Self-check / self-assessment   Membership in FIRST and applicable national CSIRT communities; accreditation by TI   Staff, budget   Official announcement, recognition by the government / authorities  Reaching basic level  While with the core elements in place a lot of questions are answered already the ground rules are laid  out. These needs to be documented, communicated and aligned to the operational context and conditions  enforced by other circumstances like the ability to provide physical security, etc.  We propose that national teams in the NISD context take up to a year to reach the basic level. Teams that  have been accredited by TF-CSIRT/TI will usually be beyond the Basic Maturity Level and should be close to  the Intermediate Maturity Level.  Progressing to intermediate level  Given the preparation taken until now it is expected that the intermediate level can be reached by focusing  on the internal processes and tools including training of the staff members.  We propose that national teams in the NISD context take up to 2 years (after reaching basic level) to reach  the intermediate level. Teams that have been certified by TF-CSIRT/TI should already be on this level.  Advancing to advanced level  The final steps are usually taking more time than expected: “the devil is in the detail”.  We propose that national teams in the NISD context take up to 2 years (after reaching intermediate level)  to reach the advanced level.  Conclusion  It is expected that some steps might take longer than others, but extending all levels to the maximum  allowed time period is not in the interest of providing a network of mature and settled teams. Therefore,  an overall maximum of 5 years to become a advanced team – counting from the official announcement of  an applicable role – is defined as baseline requirement.  Overview of Maturity Levels and Requirements  Annex A summarises the three maturity levels and the individual requirements for each parameter.  ENISA CSIRT maturity assessment model  Final| External | 30 April 2019  25  5. Conclusions  The NISD aims at creating a CSIRT Network “to contribute to developing confidence and trust between the  Member States and to promote swift and effective operational cooperation”. Each Member State shall  designate one or more CSIRTs that shall comply with a set of defined high-level requirements.  What that means for the maturity of national CSIRTs has been researched in this study, with the following  conclusions:  1. A sustainable and implementable approach towards assessing and improving maturity is best based on  a measurable set of quantities, or parameters. The SIM3 model as is commonly used in Europe serves  as an excellent basis for this, with some additions based on especially the NIS Directive.  2. The three-tier approach towards maturity levels that ENISA adopted in the 2013 report ‘CERT  community - Recognition mechanisms and schemes’ can be used to define three levels when adopting  the SIM3 maturity model to assess CSIRT maturity: basic, intermediate and advanced.  3. A specific definition of those three levels for the benefit of the NISD CSIRT Network has been proposed  in this report: essentially a set of requirements, defined on three levels of maturity. Basic level already  allows successful co-operation between teams on incident handling, the higher levels are needed to  allow the members of the CSIRT network to interact on all levels, including pro-actively. The Advanced  level has been defined at the level of the existing CSIRT Certification scheme in Europe, which means  that certification is within reach once that maturity level has been reached.  4. A validation process based on self-assessments and peer-reviews has been proposed in this report.  By adopting the proposed approach, the NISD CSIRT Network will have immediate access to a clearly  defined CSIRT maturity improvement process that is both implementable and sustainable. A growth path is  suggested here that asks teams to reach basic level within one year, intermediate two years later and  advanced another two years later: a total of five years maximum.

The Directive  states that each Member State shall designate one or more CSIRTs that shall comply with a set of defined  high-level requirements.  In order to provide input to the designated CSIRTs on this topic, ENISA contracted  a study on the maturity aspects for this type of CSIRTs, narrowed down to the national teams expected to  join the CSIRT network – the results of which are presented here.  The study takes all relevant information sources into account, with a special emphasis on the NIS Directive,  the various ENISA reports on CSIRT capabilities, maturity and metrics, and on the SIM3 maturity model for  CSIRTs which is a best practice document widely used in Europe, but also outside.  The first lesson learnt is that a sustainable and implementable approach towards assessing and improving  maturity is best based on a measurable set of quantities, or parameters. The SIM3 model as is commonly  used in Europe serves as an excellent basis for this, with some additions based on especially the NIS  Directive requirements.  The second lesson learnt is that the three-tier approach towards maturity levels that ENISA adopted in the  2013 report ‘CERT community - Recognition mechanisms and schemes’ can be used to define three levels  when adopting the SIM3 maturity model to assess CSIRT maturity: basic, intermediate and advanced.  The report specifies a proposed definition of those three levels for the benefit of the CSIRT Network  created by the NIS Directive, coupled with a validation process based on self-assessments and peer- assessments. No actual certification is prescribed, however the highest level advanced has been defined at  the level of the existing CSIRT Certification scheme in Europe, which means that certification is within  reach once that maturity level has been reached.  By adopting the proposed approach, the CSIRT Network will have immediate access to a clearly laid out  CSIRT maturity improvement process, that is both implementable and sustainable. A growth path is  suggested that reaches basic level within one year, intermediate two years later and advanced another  two years later: a total of five years maximum. Basic level already allows a minimum of successful co- operation between teams on incident handling, the higher levels are needed to allow the members of the  CSIRT network to interact on all levels, including pro-actively, thus truly giving meaning to the word CSIRT  Network.

Introduction  The EU Network and Information Security Directive (NIS Directive) aims to create a CSIRT Network “to  contribute to developing confidence and trust between the Member States and to promote swift and  effective operational cooperation”. [1] The Directive states that each Member State shall designate one or  more CSIRTs which shall comply with the requirements set out in the Directive’s point (1) of Annex I  (requirements), covering at least the sectors referred to in Annex II and the services referred to in Annex  III, responsible for risk and incident handling in accordance with a well–defined process. The Directive gives  high-level requirements that designated CSIRTs must observe, and tasks that they must perform. In order  to provide input to the designated CSIRTs on this topic, ENISA has contracted a study on CSIRTs capabilities  and parameters that represent teams’ maturity for this type of CSIRTs. For the purpose of this study the  designated CSIRT was defined as the national CSIRT. The results of this study are presented here.  ENISA CSIRT maturity assessment model  Final| External | 30 April 2019  07  2. Methodology  The work in this project focused on the maturity aspects of the CSIRT portfolio. Initially, stock- taking of  currently existing and used assessment parameters and recommendations or good practices to evaluate  CSIRT maturity (capabilities) in Europe was performed – the CSIRT maturity model SIM3 (see 2.1) was a  specially important source of such parameters. The result of that stock-taking was the identification of  areas where assessment parameters are not yet optimally defined or tailored to the needs of national  CSIRTs (according to the NISD and its obligations for dedicated CSIRTs). The outcome of the project  elaborates on these areas and parameters that have to be considered when the national CSIRTs build their  national CSIRT capabilities according to the NIS Directive obligations and/or when a national CSIRT wants  to improve their maturity and prepare for the existing certification. The results presented will build upon  the ENISA reports: CSIRT Capabilities: how to assess maturity? Guidelines for national and governmental  CSIRTs (2015) – and – CERT community - Recognition mechanisms and schemes (2013).  Input sources  Input was considered from the following areas:  1. The above-mentioned ENISA reports CSIRT Capabilities: how to assess maturity? Guidelines for  national and governmental CSIRTs [2] – and – CERT community - Recognition mechanisms and schemes  [3]  2. SIM3 model for CSIRT self-assessment and certification (generic evaluation scheme for any type of  CSIRT) [4]  3. Further ENISA baseline capabilities recommendations for national and governmental CSIRTs in Europe  (specific recommendations for national and governmental type of CSIRT) [5]  4. NIS Directive – tasks and requirements of the dedicated (national) CSIRT (obligations for national  (dedicated) CSIRT in the European Union [6]  5. GFCE CSIRT Maturity Kit [7]  6. Recommendations towards the use of SIM3 by members of the Nippon CSIRT Association [8]  7. FIRST Site Visit Requirements and Assessment [9]  Input evaluation  ENISA jointly worked with the contractor on assessing and structuring the input sources, especially the  ENISA baseline capabilities documents and the NISD. After extensive mapping and visualisation of all  aspects and parameters involved, it was concluded that mapping all of these onto the SIM3 architecture  proved to be a highly workable approach. This allowed us to research all existing SIM3 parameters, and  relate them with the NISD, ENISA documents and all other sources of input and come to recommendations  as to how NISD and ENISA baseline capabilities can be translated into a sustainable system of measurable  parameters, on which a progress in CSIRT maturity can be based.  ENISA CSIRT maturity assessment model  Final| External | 30 April 2019  08  3. Maturity Approaches  This chapter shortly re-iterates important approaches towards the topic of CSIRT maturity and concludes  with a proposal how to combine these in one sustainable approach.  ENISA  3.1.1 CERT community - Recognition mechanisms and schemes  In ENISA’s 2013 document CERT community - Recognition mechanisms and schemes, there is an analysis of  various approaches worldwide in regard the topic of CSIRT maturity. One of the document’s main features  is the proposal of a three-tier CERT maturity model:  Summary Characteristics Organisation/mechanisms  Tier 1 Fundamental  (Essential,  indispensable)  CERT is being established and  trying to earn recognition in the  CERT community (based on  individual trust building).  ENISA: A Step-by-Step Approach on  How to Set up a CSIRT (2006)  ENISA: Baseline Capabilities for  National / Governmental CERTs –  operational aspects (2009)  ENISA: Map of CERTs and Inventory  of CERT Activities in Europe (2005,  constantly updated)  TF-CSIRT/TI: ‘Listed’ status  Tier 2 Baseline  (Steady, Sure- Footed)  CERT has baseline capabilities  (operations) in place and its team  representative gained trust among  the CERT community.  ENISA: Baseline Capabilities for  National/ Governmental CERTs –  Policy recommendations (2010,  2012)  IETF: RFC-2350 (2003 update)   TF-CSIRT/TI: ‘Accreditation’   FIRST: ‘Full Membership’   APCERT: ‘Membership’   CERT/CC: Handbook for Computer  Security Incident Response Teams  (CSIRTs) (2003)  Tier 3 Advanced  (Stable, Well-  Balanced)  CERT has a complete set of  capabilities in place and has  established a stable place in the  community (no longer dependent  on individuals from the team).  ENISA: n/g CERT standard  capabilities mechanism (2014)  ISO: ISO 27035 (2011 update)  TF-CSIRT/TI: ‘Certification’  ENISA CSIRT maturity assessment model  Final| External | 30 April 2019  09  These capabilities are all  documented.  This model is then further analysed on the basis of 8 assessment categories:  1. Type of approach (organisation)  2. Requirements for CERTs  3. Validation process  4. CERTs’ focus: type and region  5. Benefits and added value of the mechanism  6. Definitions and terminology  7. Keeping the mechanism up to date  8. Promoting the mechanism and CERTs' training  And finally an important conclusion is reached, quoted here:  The number of mechanisms that exist for use by CERTs suggests that there may be room for harmonisation  of certain aspects of these mechanisms. Targeted harmonisation could benefit both the organisations that  offer mechanisms and CERTs that use them. For CERTs, harmonisation of these mechanisms can make it  easier for them to associate with more CERT community organisations that offer these mechanisms. From  the perspective of these CERT community organisations, harmonisation could enable cooperation with  other similar organisations, and allow them to more easily make use of each other's existing resources. All  of these potential advantages are about possible gained efficiencies, which is important given that these  mechanisms should be about helping CERTs reach higher stages of maturity and better serve their  constituents.  The 2013 document identifies several areas of possible harmonisation. Two of them stand out in the  context of this report:   Requirements for CERTs   Validation process  3.1.2 CSIRT Capabilities: how to assess maturity? Guidelines for national and governmental CSIRTs  ENISA’s 2015 document CSIRT Capabilities: how to assess maturity? Guidelines for national and  governmental CSIRTs [2] aims to be a guiding tool for national and governmental CSIRTs which are  considering to improve their maturity. It builds on the ENISA document discussed in 3.1.1. It starts with  noting that in Europe the predominantly used maturity scheme is that of the Trusted Introducer, which  essentially coincides with the three-tier model described in 3.1.1, and offers the levels:  1. Listing – the team is operational and contact information is available to other teams.  2. Accreditation – the team is fully functional, services are defined according to RFC2350, etc.  3. Certification – the team has reached an appropriate level of maturity.  The ENISA document then goes on to explain how the SIM3 CSIRT maturity model is the benchmark model  for Certification – but is also a very suitable tool for self-assessments of CSIRTs with the aim of improving  maturity.  The SIM3 model is explained. It consists of 44 parameters; quantities that are measured in regard maturity.  Each parameter belongs to one of the following categories:  ENISA CSIRT maturity assessment model  Final| External | 30 April 2019  10   O- Organisation   H – Human   T – Tools   P - Processes  These categories have been chosen in such a way that the parameters in there are as mutually  independent as possible. What SIM3 measures are the levels for each parameter. Simplicity has been  reached by specifying a unique set of levels, valid for all of the parameters in all of the categories:   0 = not available / undefined / unaware   1 = implicit (known/considered but not written down, “between the ears”)   2 = explicit, internal (written down but not formalised in any way)   3 = explicit, formalised on authority of CSIRT head (“rubberstamped” or published)   4 = explicit, actively assessed on authority of governance levels above the CSIRT management on a  regular basis (subject to control process/review)  The ENISA document then goes on to detail all 44 parameters and comments on how they work in the  everyday CSIRT practice in Europe – as various teams use SIM3 and several have been Certified based on  the same model. An important conclusion reached is:  In general, national and governmental CSIRTs must reach a higher maturity level and improve in order to  cope with the evolving cyberspace and its threats and vulnerabilities. The SIM3 model can be used as a tool  to assist in this process as well as to obtain an independent evaluation of CSIRT capabilities.  EU NIS Directive  On 6 July 2016, the Directive on security of network and information systems (the NIS Directive, referred  to here as NISD) was adopted by the European Parliament. Article 9 of NISD states:  Each Member State shall designate one or more CSIRTs which shall comply with the requirements set out in  point (1) of Annex I, covering at least the sectors referred to in Annex II and the services referred to in  Annex III, responsible for risk and incident handling in accordance with a well-defined process. A CSIRT may  be established within a competent authority.  And NISD continues to state that:   The CSIRTS have adequate resources to effectively carry out their tasks   Member States shall ensure the effective, efficient and secure cooperation of their CSIRTs   Member States shall ensure that their CSIRTs have access to an appropriate, secure, and resilient  communication and information infrastructure at national level   Member States shall inform the Commission about the remit, as well as the main elements of the  incident- handling process, of their CSIRTs   Member States may request the assistance of ENISA in developing national CSIRTs  Annex I of NISD is labelled REQUIREMENTS AND TASKS OF COMPUTER SECURITY INCIDENT RESPONSE  TEAMS (CSIRTs) and is quoted here in full because of its great relevance for the national/governmental  CSIRT community inside the EU:  ENISA CSIRT maturity assessment model  Final| External | 30 April 2019  11  (1)  Requirements for CSIRTs:  (a)  CSIRTs shall ensure a high level of availability of their communications services by avoiding  single points of failure, and shall have several means for being contacted and for contacting others  at all times. Furthermore, the communication channels shall be clearly specified and well known to  the constituency and cooperative partners.    (b)  CSIRTs' premises and the supporting information systems shall be located in secure sites.    (c)  Business continuity:  (i)  CSIRTs shall be equipped with an appropriate system for managing and routing  requests, in order to facilitate handovers.    (ii)  CSIRTs shall be adequately staffed to ensure availability at all times.    (iii)  CSIRTs shall rely on an infrastructure the continuity of which is ensured. To that end,  redundant systems and backup working space shall be available.    (d)  CSIRTs shall have the possibility to participate, where they wish to do so, in international  cooperation networks.    (2)  CSIRTs' tasks:  (a)  CSIRTs' tasks shall include at least the following:  (i)  monitoring incidents at a national level;    (ii)  providing early warning, alerts, announcements and dissemination of information to  relevant stakeholders about risks and incidents;    (iii)  responding to incidents;    (iv)  providing dynamic risk and incident analysis and situational awareness;    (v)  participating in the CSIRTs network.    (b)  CSIRTs shall establish cooperation relationships with the private sector.    (c)  To facilitate cooperation, CSIRTs shall promote the adoption and use of common or  standardised practices for:    (i) incident and risk-handling procedures;   (ii) incident, risk and information classification schemes.  Assessing and improving CSIRT maturity based on measurable parameters  The project team evaluated in depth all input as referred to in section 2.1, and gave special significance to  the ENISA documents discussed in section 3.1 and to the NISD discussed in section 3.2.  ENISA CSIRT maturity assessment model  Final| External | 30 April 2019  12  Based on that evaluation the following conclusions stand out:  1. A sustainable and implementable approach towards assessing and improving maturity is best based on  a measurable set of quantities, or parameters. The SIM3 model as is commonly used in Europe serves  as an excellent basis for this, with some additions based on especially the NISD requirements, and on  recent insights as e.g. formulated by ENISA in their 2015 report on this topic1.  2. A three-tier approach towards maturity levels is recognised both by ENISA and by TF-CSIRT/Trusted  Introducer, the European cooperation body of all types of CSIRTs. It is possible to tie that in to the  SIM3 maturity model by introducing, again, three levels of increasing maturity. For the sake of this  report these levels have been labelled basic, intermediate and advanced – the latter, most mature,  level connecting with the existing CSIRT Certification scheme in Europe. It is important to note that no  exact 1:1 mapping between these three levels and the older schemes is proposed here – but rather a  unified, sustainable approach meant to serve especially the “CSIRT Network” required by the NISD.  The next chapter details this proposed approach.  1 SIM3 in its current version was essentially written in 2009 – since then there were only minor updates. A revision of  SIM3 towards “version 2” is currently being undertaken, the results of which are expected in 2017. Arguably, the  outcomes reached in this report will be important input for that revision, which is expected to even more increase  the already strong alignment between the recommendations of this report and the SIM3 maturity model.  ENISA CSIRT maturity assessment model  Final| External | 30 April 2019  13  4. Sustainable three-tier maturity approach:  how to become a mature team?  The maturity of a CSIRT can only grow by performing the tasks assigned to the team combined with a  culture of continuous improvement, supported by proper education and training. Also, policies,  procedures and workflows that support the team’s goals and tasks, must be in place and need to have  been polished by real life application. As all of that, and more, is required in order to be considered a  mature team, this clearly requires that the team has been operating long enough to allow that kind of  reliance on their own merits.  The question that comes up is: what all is needed to become a mature team?  This chapter will answer this question and provide a process that enables each team – both experienced  and new ones – to set and reach their maturity goals over time.  Applicability and Requirements  What we have considered so far does in fact apply to many types of CSIRTs. To increase maturity has  become an essential requirement for capacity building, and for a reliable and proven cooperation between  teams.  Clearly, all teams that operate on a national scale or with a national scope, even if only responsible for one  sector, need to be mature enough to be reliable partners in the CSIRT cooperation. This is especially true  for those teams that have been assigned the role of national CSIRT, designated CSIRT or defined point of  contact according to the NISD. But also, any government and military teams including those on the state  level within federated structures can be expected to adhere to the same principles.  In all cases it is essential that the teams to which these considerations apply, are well integrated in the  existing CSIRT communities. Some of the teams are by definition part of the CSIRT network established by  the NISD, but this network is not open to all CSIRTs and it covers only a small part of the globally active  teams. Accreditation by TF-CSIRT / Trusted Introducer inside Europe, and FIRST membership globally, are  therefore considered evolutionary steps for teams in increasing their maturity. In addition, especially  teams with a national scope or role, must be active and supportive members of their national CSIRT  community, as this is laying the foundation for a trusted and reliable CSIRT co-operation inside any given  country.  Introducing levels of maturity  As stated in the introduction, it is important to achieve a gradual improvement of operational experience  of teams and their maturity. Depending on the team’s budget, and on the resources dedicated to  establishing maturity, the speed with which different teams manage to reach the desired level of reliability  will vary. Other factors like the experience of the staff, the turn-over rate of staff members and the budget  attributed to trainings and exercises, are important too as much of the operational excellence of any team  resides in their staff.  Past experience has shown that the number of different parameters can be overwhelming, especially for  new teams that are planning to prepare for maturity or are limited in the budget available for  improvement, while handling day-to-day business and responding to incidents of national interest. To  ENISA CSIRT maturity assessment model  Final| External | 30 April 2019  14  overcome this uncertainty and provide for a maturity program allowing the teams to advance in their own  speed but while doing so addressing the most important issues first, we introduce three levels of maturity:   Basic Maturity Level – For this level, activities on all parameters have been started with a clear focus  on the mandate and other formal considerations of the team’s role. Approximately 80% of the  organisational parameters have already been addressed to such a degree, that they can be considered  “advanced”.   Intermediate Maturity Level – Based on the work done so far, progress for all parameters, except for  those already on “advanced” level, has been achieved. Overall, approximately 50% of the human, tool  and process parameters can be considered “advanced”.   Advanced Maturity Level – The final step directs the efforts to the remaining parameters and achieves  a level that is considered “advanced”.  As we will explain, the demands for maturity for teams co-operating in the CSIRT Network as defined by  the NIS Directive is somewhat higher than for the current Trusted Introducer (TI) Certification [10]. This  implies that all teams that are on the “advanced maturity level” can become a TI certified team by applying  for it. Due to the set-up of the TI Certification, which is based on a formal process with independent  assessments, this may still cause some effort – but this should be limited, as the content covered and the  ratings applied are the same.  Assuming that all teams to be considered have already been accredited by the TI, we have used this as the  starting point and will focus on the additional efforts to reach the next levels. In the following sections we  will examine the four areas of parameters – Organisation, Human, Tools, Processes – for each of the three  maturity levels. At the start of each sub-section a table will show the requirements in colour coding. The  table below shows an example:  The previous/current level in this example is “Basic”, the desired level is “Intermediate”. Already at “Basic”  level, the parameter X-2 is on the “Advanced” level, indicated by the dark blue background and white font.  All other parameters from the previous/current level have a light background and black font.  In order to advance to the next level “Intermediate”, the team needs to substantiate the level for the  factors X-1, X-3 and X-4. Three different colours are used here to differentiate:   Parameter X-1 is pushed to the “Advanced” level, indicated by the dark blue background and white  font.   Parameter X-3 stays on the same level and does not require further work. Therefore, the light  background and black font are used for this as before, indicating “no change”.   Parameter X-4 improves, but not yet to “Advanced” level, shown by the light blue background and  black font.  X-1 X-2 X-3 X-4  Basic 3  3 1 1  Intermediate 4 3  1  2  ENISA CSIRT maturity assessment model  Final| External | 30 April 2019  15  Maturity Level: Basic – how to get the basics right  Specific organisational decisions are necessary with the creation of any new CSIRT. But such decisions are  most important if national CSIRTs are set up according to the NIS Directive. Therefore, the focus of  reaching the Basic Maturity Level lies on these parameters. But as it is not enough to produce the proper  documentation and organisational set-up, work on the other parameters will start.  4.3.1 Basic Maturity Level : Why  For the CSIRT network to function at a basic level covering at least the co-ordinated handling of incidents,  it is necessary that the CSIRTs involved have a minimum foundation in terms of their existence (mandate  etc.), are reachable and have a basic incident handling process. The Basic Maturity Level focuses on  achieving this. The organisational parameters will already reach a fair level of maturity (mostly 3) with this  level, while the majority of the other parameters are only level 1 or 2.  As starting point to reach Basic Maturity Level, we use the TI accreditation.2 This system which has existed  for 15 years in Europe, provides a minimal baseline for information that teams should make accessible to  other community members in regard their organisation and operation. We found that, within the EU  realm, more than 90% of all national CSIRTs or government teams with national scope have already been  accredited. This shows that the TI accreditation is well accepted and has indeed become a best practice in  and of itself.  Compared to other baselines like FIRST membership, the TI accreditation is fully documented  and transparent for all participants. It does not rely on a subjective site visit which is carried out in very  different ways determined only by the visiting team vouching for the visited team, as happens for FIRST  membership. Considering all this, the TI Accreditation provides the deterministic and uniquely shared  common viewpoint that serves as the best point to start from.  4.3.2 Organisational Parameters  To provide the foundation of a reliable service, the following organisational parameters need to be  documented for external consumption and approved/set into force by the team management. Without  this no defined basis for the team’s mission would be available:   O-1: Mandate   O-2: Constituency   O-3: Authority   O-4: Responsibility   O-5: Service Description   O-7: Service Level Description   O-9: Participation in existing CERT Frameworks   O-10: Organisational Framework  The parameters O-7 and O-10 will not require further work, as it is not expected that all Service Levels will  be actively assessed by higher management, and the Organisational Framework – most often referred to  as “CSIRT Handbook” – is not designated to be necessarily published or become widely distributed. Both  factors however require to be enforced internally by the team management.  2 https://www.trusted-introducer.org/processes/accreditation.html  https://www.trusted-introducer.org/processes/accreditation.html  ENISA CSIRT maturity assessment model  Final| External | 30 April 2019  16  For the two remaining parameters at least some consensus on the team level has to be reached. While it  seems rather unlikely that this will not require some sort of documentation to be used consistently such  requirements have been postponed to further levels.   O-8: Incident Classification   O-11: Security Policy  The table shows an overview of the initial values and the required improvements:3  O-1 O-2 O-3 O-4 O-5 O-7 O-8 O-9 O-10 O-11  Accreditation (3) (3) Opt.

Certainly the  escalation to the governance level needs to be well documented for external consumption and  approved/set into force by the team management:   P-1: Escalation to Governance level  Documentation is also required for five other parameters, although not yet for external consumption:   P-8: Process of active team assessment by higher management   P-9: Emergency Reachability Process   P-10: Common Mailbox Names   P-11: Secure Information Handling Process   P-14: Reporting Process  All other process related parameters are considered to be addressed in succeeding levels:   P-2: Press Escalation   P-3: Legal Escalation   P-4: Incident Prevention Process   P-5: Incident Detection Process   P-6: Incident Resolution Process   P-7: Specific Incident Processes   P-12: Information Sources Process   P-13: Outreach Process   P-15: Statistics Process   P-16: Meeting Process   P-17: Peer-to-Peer Process  T-1 T-2 T-3 T-4 T-5 T-6 T-7 T-8 T-9 T-10  Accreditation -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --  Basic  1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1  1  ENISA CSIRT maturity assessment model  Final| External | 30 April 2019  18  The tables show an overview of the initial values and the required improvements:  Maturity Level: Intermediate – how to advance  Based on the basis achieved by the previous efforts, the main focus now is to set up the management  control functions for the organisational parameters, pushing 8 of 10 parameters to the “Advanced” level.  The work on the other areas – Human, Tool, Process – is building on the previous work and ensures  progress on most parameters.  4.4.1 Intermediate Maturity Level : Why  For the CSIRT network to function reliably in regard the co-ordinated handling of incidents, and also allows  additional joint activities (like vulnerability handling), it is necessary that the CSIRTs involved reach a more  advanced maturity level than Basic, focusing on a mature foundation and decent descriptions of all  relevant tools, processes and human aspects. The Intermediate Maturity Level has been constructed to  achieve this. The organisational parameters will now already reach a high level of maturity (more than 50%  will be at level 4), the tool parameters will be at level 2, whereas the human and process parameters will  be at either level 2 or 3, depending on their relevance for the CSIRT network co-operation.  4.4.2 Organisational Parameters  The “Intermediate” level requires six more organisational parameters to become management controlled.  These are:   O-1: Mandate   O-2: Constituency   O-3: Authority   O-4: Responsibility   O-5: Service Description   O-9: Participation in existing CERT Frameworks  For the two remaining parameters for this level documentation is required:   O-8: Incident Classification   O-11: Security Policy  The table shows an overview of the initial values and the required improvements:  P-1 P-2 P-3 P-4 P-5 P-6 P-7 P-8 P-9 P-10  Accreditation  -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --  Basic 3 1 1 1 1 1 1 2 2  2  P-11 P-12 P-13 P-14 P-15 P-16 P-17  Accreditation -- -- -- -- -- -- --  Basic 2 1 1 2 1 1 1  O-1 O-2 O-3 O-4 O-5 O-7 O-8 O-9 O-10 O-11  Basic 3 3 3 3 3 3 1 3  3 1  Intermediate 4 4 4 4 4 3 2 4 3  2  ENISA CSIRT maturity assessment model  Final| External | 30 April 2019  19  4.4.3 Human Parameters  Summarizing the progress for these parameters is easy: advancements for all parameters. To already  started work on the documented parameters leads to documents that are documented for external  consumption and approved/set into force by the team management:   H-1: Code of Conduct/Practice/Ethics   H-2: Personal Resilience   H-7: External Networking  The other four parameters are now to be documented at least for internal use by the:   H-3: Skillset Description   H-4: Internal Training   H-5: External Technical Training   H-6: External Communication Training  The table shows an overview of the initial values and the required improvements:  4.4.4 Tools Parameters  Progress related to the tool parameters is achieved by providing proper documentation for internal use by  the team for:   T-2: Information Sources List   T-3: Consolidated E-Mail System   T-4: Incident Tracking System   T-5: Resilient Phone   T-6: Resilient E-Mail   T-7: Resilient Internet Access  Work on the following parameter is not yet required:   T-10: Incident Resolution Toolset  The table shows an overview of the initial values and the required improvements:  4.4.5 Process Parameters  Of the five documented (for internal use within the team) parameters only one (P-10: Common Mailbox  Names) will not need to be documented for external consumption and approved/set into force by the  team management:  H-1 H-2 H-3 H-4 H-5 H-6 H-7  Basic  2 2 1 1 1 1 2  Intermediate  3 3 2 2 2 2 3  T-1 T-2 T-3 T-4 T-5 T-6 T-7 T-8 T-9 T-10  Basic 1 1 1 1 1 1 1  1 1  1  Intermediate 1  2 2 2 2 2 2 1 1 1  ENISA CSIRT maturity assessment model  Final| External | 30 April 2019  20   P-8: Process of active team assessment by higher management   P-9: Emergency Reachability Process   P-11: Secure Information Handling Process   P-14: Reporting Process  The majority of not yet documented process related parameters are now considered to be required for  internal use by the team:   P-2: Press Escalation   P-3: Legal Escalation   P-4: Incident Prevention Process   P-5: Incident Detection Process   P-6: Incident Resolution Process   P-7: Specific Incident Processes   P-12: Information Sources Process   P-13: Outreach Process   P-15: Statistics Process  The last two processes still handled informally will need to be addressed before moving to the “Advanced”  level:   P-16: Meeting Process   P-17: Peer-to-Peer Process  The tables show an overview of the initial values and the required improvements:  Maturity Level: Advanced – how to reach the objective  While there are only some small efforts left for the organisational parameters by now, the focus of this  step is to finish the efforts for the other three areas – Human, Tool, Process – successfully.  4.5.1 Advanced Maturity Level : Why  For the CSIRT network to function excellently in regard the co-ordinated handling of incidents, and also  reliably supports additional joint activities like the sharing of threats and early-warning data, vulnerability  handling, it is necessary that the CSIRTs involved reach an advanced maturity level, beyond Intermediate,  focusing on well described, approved – and in various cases, actively assessed – processes, tools and  human aspects. The Advanced Maturity Level has been constructed to achieve this. The organisational  parameters were already at a high level with Intermediate, but now also all the human, tool and process  parameters will reach level 3, and in important cases even level 4.

This is however outside the scope  of this report. The TI Certification is the currently only existing certification scheme for CSIRTs, which is  operated by TF-CSIRT/TI in Europe. At this moment, the levels chosen in this report are equal to or exceed  in several cases the existing Certification demands. This is partially due to the fact that these demands  have been drawn up back in 2009, but also to the fact that the NISD invokes some stronger maturity  demands. The TF-CSIRT/TI Certification is currently under revision, to be concluded in 2017. It can be  expected that some of the demands will become more strict and in fact the standard set in this report is  expected to be close to that. In all cases, when a team reaches the Advanced level, and have done their  assessment well (see 4.6), it is to be expected that actual TI Certification – where the assessment is done  by means of independent, external review, should be within easy reach.  4.5.2 Organisation Parameters  For the final level the two remaining parameters for this level are now made available externally or  enforced by the team management:   O-8: Incident Classification   O-11: Security Policy  The table shows an overview of the initial values and the required improvements:  4.5.3 Human Parameters  Only the four parameters that until now have been required only to be documented for internal use have  to be improved. For the “Advanced” level they are required to be made available externally or enforced by  the team management:   H-3: Skillset Description   H-4: Internal Training   H-5: External Technical Training   H-6: External Communication Training  The table shows an overview of the initial values and the required improvements:  4.5.4 Tools  Parameters  Based on the proper documentation for internal use by the team produced at least for the “Intermediate”  level the “Advanced” level requires now documents that are made available externally or enforced by the  team management:   T-2: Information Sources List   T-3: Consolidated E-Mail System   T-4: Incident Tracking System  O-1 O-2 O-3 O-4 O-5 O-7 O-8 O-9 O-10 O-11  Intermediate 4 4 4 4 4 3 2 4 3  2  Advanced 4 4 4 4 4 3 3 4 3 3  H-1 H-2 H-3 H-4 H-5 H-6 H-7  Intermediate 3 3 2 2 2 2 3  Advanced 3 3 3 3 3 3 3  ENISA CSIRT maturity assessment model  Final| External | 30 April 2019  22   T-5: Resilient Phone   T-6: Resilient E-Mail   T-7: Resilient Internet Access  Work on the following parameter is also concluded by now resulting in the proper documentation:   T-10: Incident Resolution Toolset  The table shows an overview of the initial values and the required improvements:  4.5.5 Process Parameters  Two of the process parameters are considered to be of overriding importance for the perception and  success of the team’s operation. One describes the system by which the higher management actively  assesses the team, the other ensures the continuous improvement of the team’s operations. In addition  the reporting allowing the monitoring of the team’s performance as well as the assessment of current  trends and developments are key requirements. Both parameters therefore need to become enforced or  examined by an entity overseeing the team’s operation:   P-8: Review / Feedback Processes   P-14: Reporting Process  Of those parameters, that had been documented for internal use by the team the following six are now  required to be documented for external consumption and approved/set into force by the team  management:   P-2: Press Escalation   P-3: Legal Escalation   P-7: Specific Incident Processes   P-12: Information Sources Process   P-13: Outreach Process   P-15: Statistics Process  The last two processes still handled informally will need to be at least documented for internal use by the  team:   P-16: Meeting Process   P-17: Peer-to-Peer Process  The tables show an overview of the initial values and the required improvements:  T-1 T-2 T-3 T-4 T-5 T-6 T-7 T-8 T-9 T-10  Intermediate  1  2 2 2 2 2 2  1 1  1  Advanced 1 3 3 3 3 3 3 1 1 2  P-1 P-2 P-3 P-4 P-5 P-6 P-7 P-8 P-9 P-10  Intermediate 3 2 2  2 2 2  2 3 3 2  Advanced 3 3 3 2 2 2 3 4 3 2  P-11 P-12 P-13 P-14 P-15 P-16 P-17  ENISA CSIRT maturity assessment model  Final| External | 30 April 2019  23  Assessment  With any scheme established to allow a common approach towards increasing maturity, there needs to be  some mechanism to exchange related status information, and to ensure within the trust group accepting  those maturity levels, that such status information can be relied upon. Within the CSIRT communities,  specific “trust marks” have already been established, but it is certain that this new process supporting the  described maturity levels will establish another “trust mark”, as it builds on the existing maturity  assessment system (SIM3) yet comes with higher demands for national teams with critical tasks.  For this reason, it is necessary to define some kind of assessment that supports the new trust mark but is  anchored in the community itself. Two approaches that can be combined are recommended:  1. Self-Assessment – The SIM3 maturity model has been created as a model for self-assessments,  recognizing the basis needs for each team itself to determine its own level of success in advancing to a  more reliable and mature service-oriented entity.  2. Peer Review – By documenting the outcome of any self-assessment in a more formal and structured  document, the outcome authorized by the team’s management can be exchanged within the trusted  community. By exchanging this information, the team exposes itself but it does so to demonstrate that  trust can be placed on it.  As it was explained throughout this document there are limits that can be achieved by self-declaration. It  became obvious that requirements related to some parameters need to be assessed not by the team itself  but in an independent fashion. It is clear therefore, that the outcome of any self-assessment cannot  demonstrate in an objective way towards other teams that such an independent assessment is indeed in  place and functional. To overcome this gap, the peer review is an important step forward, even if not the  whole answer.  It is proposed that for all parameters requiring active assessment (level 4) the team needs to provide  evidence to its peers – the other teams – supporting the claim. If the claim is checked and approved, this  result can be recorded as part of the available status information.  Proposed Timeline  As said in the introduction of this chapter it will take some time to advance to a mature team. Due to the  reasons described maturity cannot be achieved by the simple will of anyone. You might compare it to the  situation of young people getting their driving license: They (finally) got the mandate/license and passed  all tests, so operationally they can drive and there is a justifiable hope that they will not do harm to others  or themselves. But others would not consider any such person a “mature” driver. For that much more  practice and experience is needed, enabling us to drive safely despite conditions that might be far from  optimal. The same is true for advancing to be a “mature” team.

These needs to be documented, communicated and aligned to the operational context and conditions  enforced by other circumstances like the ability to provide physical security, etc.  We propose that national teams in the NISD context take up to a year to reach the basic level. Teams that  have been accredited by TF-CSIRT/TI will usually be beyond the Basic Maturity Level and should be close to  the Intermediate Maturity Level.  Progressing to intermediate level  Given the preparation taken until now it is expected that the intermediate level can be reached by focusing  on the internal processes and tools including training of the staff members.  We propose that national teams in the NISD context take up to 2 years (after reaching basic level) to reach  the intermediate level. Teams that have been certified by TF-CSIRT/TI should already be on this level.  Advancing to advanced level  The final steps are usually taking more time than expected: “the devil is in the detail”.  We propose that national teams in the NISD context take up to 2 years (after reaching intermediate level)  to reach the advanced level.  Conclusion  It is expected that some steps might take longer than others, but extending all levels to the maximum  allowed time period is not in the interest of providing a network of mature and settled teams. Therefore,  an overall maximum of 5 years to become a advanced team – counting from the official announcement of  an applicable role – is defined as baseline requirement.  Overview of Maturity Levels and Requirements  Annex A summarises the three maturity levels and the individual requirements for each parameter.  ENISA CSIRT maturity assessment model  Final| External | 30 April 2019  25  5. Conclusions  The NISD aims at creating a CSIRT Network “to contribute to developing confidence and trust between the  Member States and to promote swift and effective operational cooperation”. Each Member State shall  designate one or more CSIRTs that shall comply with a set of defined high-level requirements.  What that means for the maturity of national CSIRTs has been researched in this study, with the following  conclusions:  1. A sustainable and implementable approach towards assessing and improving maturity is best based on  a measurable set of quantities, or parameters. The SIM3 model as is commonly used in Europe serves  as an excellent basis for this, with some additions based on especially the NIS Directive.  2. The three-tier approach towards maturity levels that ENISA adopted in the 2013 report ‘CERT  community - Recognition mechanisms and schemes’ can be used to define three levels when adopting  the SIM3 maturity model to assess CSIRT maturity: basic, intermediate and advanced.  3. A specific definition of those three levels for the benefit of the NISD CSIRT Network has been proposed  in this report: essentially a set of requirements, defined on three levels of maturity. Basic level already  allows successful co-operation between teams on incident handling, the higher levels are needed to  allow the members of the CSIRT network to interact on all levels, including pro-actively. The Advanced  level has been defined at the level of the existing CSIRT Certification scheme in Europe, which means  that certification is within reach once that maturity level has been reached.  4. A validation process based on self-assessments and peer-reviews has been proposed in this report.  By adopting the proposed approach, the NISD CSIRT Network will have immediate access to a clearly  defined CSIRT maturity improvement process that is both implementable and sustainable. A growth path is  suggested here that asks teams to reach basic level within one year, intermediate two years later and  advanced another two years later: a total of five years maximum.

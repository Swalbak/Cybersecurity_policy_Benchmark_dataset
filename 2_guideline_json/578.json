EP3R 2013 – Position Paper  Task Forces on Terminology Definitions and Categorisation of Assets (TF-TDCA)  December 2013  Page  iv  Executive summary  Since 2011, the plenary sessions of EP3R addressed a number of topics ranging from Trusted  Information Sharing, Incidents Preparedness and Management, Mutual Aid Assistance and the  Protection of Critical Information Infrastructure.  As EP3R discussions progressed, participants realised gradually that many concepts and terms were  not clearly defined.  During Summer 2012, the EP3R constituency devised a number of Work Objectives, and the initial  Working Group 1 on Key Assets Categorisation led to the Creation of two Task Forces to issue a  proposal for a methodology. The two topics addressed would be “Terminology Definitions” on one  hand, and “Categorisation of Assets” on the other hand.  Since a common terminology is the base of the characterisation of assets, it was later decided to use  the latter to initiate the first.  Both Task Forces were given 3 months to reach a conclusion on both topics. A few teleconferences  and individual contributions helped to build this document.  Together, the efforts of these two different task forces also represent the starting point for future  efforts to secure and improve resilience in Europe’s cross-border and cross-organization context.  Another important trait of these two task forces with the other EP3R position papers is the use of  the Mutual Aid for Resilient Infrastructure In Europe (MARIE) ingredients in order to offer to all the  interested stakeholders a comprehensive and articulated approach for cooperation and  collaboration.  The work produced by both Task Forces includes:  - A list of commonly accepted Terminology sources; (see Annex A)  - A proposal to categorise Terminology definitions according to their context; (Annex C)  - An initial devise of key terms, those initially necessary to all Task Forces and further EP3R  works; (Chapter 2.4)  - An ontology for categorisation of assets and future development of Terminology Definitions;  (Chapter 3.2)  As a common approach to subsequent activities (such as Risk Management, Business Continuity  Management, etc). The Task Force recommends the pragmatic adoption of the 8 Ingredients devised  in the M.A.R.I.E. (Mutual Aid for Resilient Infrastructure in Europe) as root  Categories for Key ICT  Assets. Should other sectors be later considered, a similar ontology could be developed where  needed.  Those recommendations were intended for EP3R, but however are valid for any Public-Private  Partnership including EP3R’s successor, the NIS Platform.

Such a Position Paper was intentionally kept small so it could be easily communicated and shared  among EP3R participants to foster common understanding in a fast and effective way.  The principle adopted within EP3R was that each Task Force would establish their own specific  Terminology whenever required, and use this approach as a principle.  Goal  The purpose of inventorying Terminology sources was initially to ensure that all Participants could  work on the same grounds, and allow discussions to be cleared from any misunderstanding.  Target audience  This Position Paper is addressed to all EP3R participants and the NIS Platform Working Groups.  The methodology used in these task forces is similar to previous EP3R efforts. Several seasoned  industry experts from different organization and backgrounds provided their expertise and advice in  the definition of the contents.  Following to on-site meetings and the desktop research, some individual feedback and  recommendations where provided and used to integrate the materials collaboratively exchanged  and produced via email and during the open teleconferences. The contents and participation to  these task forces was renewed in two different occasions and cover a wide spectrum of expertise  and different type of organizations and backgrounds.  These initial efforts lasted two months during Spring 2013.  Terminology Definitions  During the early stages of work in the EP3R working groups, Participants have many times reported  that several words were lacking a clear definition and also a common understanding.  As a consequence, discussions were hanging on details to clarify, instead of allowing a seemless and  fluid debate.  The EP3R Working Group 1 on Key Assets therefore recommended that a Glossary is collegially  adopted by EP3R constituency as a reference for further works.  For these reasons the scope of the Task Force was focused on:  - Taking stock of existing Terminology definitions available freely (to avoid licencing issues);  - Identifying commonly used terms in the CIIP sector;  - Providing or reuse (where possible) for each term a simple and effective definition, avoiding  controversial definitions as much as possible.  - Using free sources for such definitions where available to build up their recommendations,  or get authorisation from relevant author(s).  The Deliverable of the TF was defined as follows in the EP3R Work Objectives:  - A list of Terms commonly used in the CIIP Industry;  EP3R 2013 – Position Paper  Task Forces on Terminology Definitions and Categorisation of Assets (TF-TDCA)  December 2013  Page  2  - A proposal of definition for each term, reusing where possible open and free dictionaries;  - A list of commonly used Sources in the ICT Sector.  Assets Categorisation  A risk assessment of the protection level of Critical Information Infrastructures depends initially on a  comprehensive inventory of all the components which constitute them.  These are generally referred to as “assets” and comprise equally physical and technical assets,  facilities, but also resources (e.g. supply chain), functions (i.e. Human operations), and regulatory  environment (e.g. Policies, Standards, etc).  A proper risk analysis approach would take into consideration any ingredient of the resulting service  operated, and assess each asset category’s risk occurrence and likelihood.  Since EP3R focuses on the proper operations of Critical Information Infrastructures (and unlike the  Art.13a regulation *not* on the services), the actual operations of the CII are under the initial scope  of reflection.  The Task force was requested to undertake all necessary actions to define a proper and useful  approach to the usage of CII stakeholders to ensure all Critical Assets supporting CIIs are  encompassed in risk analysis, business continuity planning and disaster recovery exercises, hence  ensuring proper preparedness and response capability for disasters or incidents.  This requirement arose following the presentation during an EP3R Plenary Session (December 2011)  of a major Telecom Operator’s Risk Management methodology.  Among the activities undertaken, the following have been considered:  - Taking stock on current practices in place in Member States for defining NCIs;  - Taking stock on Industry’s Risk Identification and Risk Management good practices;  - Evaluating the setup a reference framework and initiate a research activity on the  methodology for the identification of ECIIs. “Functional” supply chains could be identified  together with connections/ interconnections.  - Convergence to a final, simple result.  The Deliverable of the TF was defined as follows in the EP3R Work Objectives:  - A taxonomy of typical components which constitute a Critical Information Infrastructure.  - From the various methodologies proposed, select the parts relevant to Critical Information  Infrastructures Protection, and establish a formal recommendation for a set of criteria  allowing “Key Assets Identification”.  EP3R 2013 – Position Paper  Task Forces on Terminology Definitions and Categorisation of Assets (TF-TDCA)  December 2013  Page  3  2 Adoption of Terminology Sources  2.1 Key Terminology  During the discussions of the Task force it was decided to start addressing the issue using a  taxonomy approach. Due the short timeframe and the voluntary basis involvement it was considered  difficult to produce a comprehensive glossary covering all the possible terms. Therefore the TF  decided to give a clear and unique definition only of the most important concepts that represent the  foundations of all EP3R efforts.  The result is close to 160 definitions gathered  from free access sources, properly referenced,  and some definitions developed by the TF  members themselves when the existing ones  were not satisfactory.  For the broader glossary it was preferred to  define a first list of most common term and for  those not covered use taxonomy to  characterize the most important clusters and  bound them with the most relevant references  present in literature.  The following definitions were identified,  adopted by the Task Force, and used as  foundation for all discussions relating to  Critical Information Infrastructures.  2.2 Terminology Sources  While discussing the allocation, it was possible  to pinpoint the following list of references  from authoritative resources for each cluster.  The present list does not cover all the possible references but can allow the creation of a common  baseline in defining typical components which constitute a Critical Information Infrastructure.

The process of organising the terminology  required an initial assumption, and more  specifically to avoid reinventing the wheel.  It was suggested to use the 8 ingredients  mentioned in the MARIE report1 in order to  align this output with previous works and to  provide continuity both in scope and  terminology.  The full list of Categorised Terminology is  attached in Annex C.  The definition of an agreed common  terminology definition not only poses the  baseline for Categorization of assets, but  fosters also a the definition of mutual  efforts between cross-industry and cross- border communities. Basing the  terminology cluster reference on the  Mutual Aid for Resilient Infrastructure In  Europe (MARIE) eight ingredients provides a mutual starting point but also maximize the  convergence of the task forces outputs, starting with the establishment of proper Terminology in  each Category.  1  Rauscher, K.F., Krock, R.E. & Runyon, J.P., 2006.

During the  teleconferences several methods have been discussed in order to create an initial risk mapping  ontology in order to follow the path traced by existing literature2 regarding CI. Existing experiences  like the one in Finland3 and UK4 were cited as possible examples to refer to.  The initial idea was to focus on public networks and align the work with the Art 13a5 content, which  is the obligation for the Telecom Operators to report incidents. Therefore it was decided to proceed  initially with definitions of Critical Infrastructure / Critical Information Infrastructure / European  Critical Infrastructure.  Moreover the different business models that can be applied in the Telco sector  (fixed/mobile/connectivity provider) were emphasised and also the consequent different definitions  of criticality.  3.2 Initial Ontology  During the initial open teleconferences the task force decided to tackle the problem starting from  the differences between Internet Exchanges points (IXs) and manufacturers methodologies: IXs are  more focused on the physical and supply chain and the data/control plane repercussions, while  Manufacturers will concentrate on the meta-classification of specific assets.  Moreover the different business models that can be applied in the Telco sector  (fixed/mobile/connectivity provider) were emphasised and also the consequent different definitions  of criticality.  In the course of the proceedings and discussions with the experts it was decided to use primarily the  Mutual Aid for Resilient Infrastructure in Europe (MARIE) eight ingredients to align the output with  the other task forces.  This effort helps to draw a red line between the different goals and have a more holistic approach.  In the presented table the effort of the TF are sketched in order to give the an overview of the  possible different aspects that must be addressed.  The following ontology should therefore be viewed as a means of gaining a foothold in an extensive,  dynamic subject rather than as a statement of universally accepted fact.  2  JRC-IPSC, ’’Risk assessment methodologies for Critical Infrastructure Protection.

Thus by using the Mutual Aid for Resilient Infrastructure In Europe (MARIE) eight ingredients this  could be also connected with all the related literature and efforts and allow the interested parties to  foster collaboration based on the same terminology baseline. For this reason also the terminology  definition approach that follows makes use of the same categorisation.  The figure below shows a initial proposal classification of activities, assets and paves the way for  Terminology categorisation and development as well.

The Task Forces ran for two months, just before the EP3R was subsumed to the NIS  Platform.  This was actually the first attempt within the European Public Private Partnership for Resilience to  reach convergence points in Participants’ understanding, and allow to prevent many  misunderstandings as they used to happen in the past.  The Task Force acknowledges that this iteration solely addresses the Telecom Sector, and suggests  that it should be expanded to Sectors which depend on ICT, such as Health, Finance, Transports,  Energy.  But also, such definitions might be also needed for the specifics of CyberSecurity areas: Botnets,  Cyber Police, etc.  The process for each Sector should be similar, i.e. the identification of Terminology Sources relevant  to the Sector considered, submitting a consolidated listing of terms to a panel of Experts, and their  formal adoption of one definition per term.  Among the important uses of Terminology Definitions, the Task Force felt that Mutual Aid Assistance  was probably the most crucial, since all participants in the Agreement need to speak the same  language.  Some specifics of Mutual Aid Assistance should therefore be explored and a proper list of defined  terms adopted.  In the Working Groups meeting of the NIS Platform, a few participants raised the need for starting a  similar initiative. EP3R therefore hands over its initial conclusions so their starting point is already  more advanced than for EP3R, 4 years ago.

EP3R 2013 – Position Paper  Task Forces on Terminology Definitions and Categorisation of Assets (TF-TDCA)  December 2013  Page  iv  Executive summary  Since 2011, the plenary sessions of EP3R addressed a number of topics ranging from Trusted  Information Sharing, Incidents Preparedness and Management, Mutual Aid Assistance and the  Protection of Critical Information Infrastructure.  As EP3R discussions progressed, participants realised gradually that many concepts and terms were  not clearly defined.  During Summer 2012, the EP3R constituency devised a number of Work Objectives, and the initial  Working Group 1 on Key Assets Categorisation led to the Creation of two Task Forces to issue a  proposal for a methodology. The two topics addressed would be “Terminology Definitions” on one  hand, and “Categorisation of Assets” on the other hand.  Since a common terminology is the base of the characterisation of assets, it was later decided to use  the latter to initiate the first.  Both Task Forces were given 3 months to reach a conclusion on both topics. A few teleconferences  and individual contributions helped to build this document.  Together, the efforts of these two different task forces also represent the starting point for future  efforts to secure and improve resilience in Europe’s cross-border and cross-organization context.  Another important trait of these two task forces with the other EP3R position papers is the use of  the Mutual Aid for Resilient Infrastructure In Europe (MARIE) ingredients in order to offer to all the  interested stakeholders a comprehensive and articulated approach for cooperation and  collaboration.  The work produced by both Task Forces includes:  - A list of commonly accepted Terminology sources; (see Annex A)  - A proposal to categorise Terminology definitions according to their context; (Annex C)  - An initial devise of key terms, those initially necessary to all Task Forces and further EP3R  works; (Chapter 2.4)  - An ontology for categorisation of assets and future development of Terminology Definitions;  (Chapter 3.2)  As a common approach to subsequent activities (such as Risk Management, Business Continuity  Management, etc). The Task Force recommends the pragmatic adoption of the 8 Ingredients devised  in the M.A.R.I.E. (Mutual Aid for Resilient Infrastructure in Europe) as root  Categories for Key ICT  Assets. Should other sectors be later considered, a similar ontology could be developed where  needed.  Those recommendations were intended for EP3R, but however are valid for any Public-Private  Partnership including EP3R’s successor, the NIS Platform.

Such a Position Paper was intentionally kept small so it could be easily communicated and shared  among EP3R participants to foster common understanding in a fast and effective way.  The principle adopted within EP3R was that each Task Force would establish their own specific  Terminology whenever required, and use this approach as a principle.  Goal  The purpose of inventorying Terminology sources was initially to ensure that all Participants could  work on the same grounds, and allow discussions to be cleared from any misunderstanding.  Target audience  This Position Paper is addressed to all EP3R participants and the NIS Platform Working Groups.  The methodology used in these task forces is similar to previous EP3R efforts. Several seasoned  industry experts from different organization and backgrounds provided their expertise and advice in  the definition of the contents.  Following to on-site meetings and the desktop research, some individual feedback and  recommendations where provided and used to integrate the materials collaboratively exchanged  and produced via email and during the open teleconferences. The contents and participation to  these task forces was renewed in two different occasions and cover a wide spectrum of expertise  and different type of organizations and backgrounds.  These initial efforts lasted two months during Spring 2013.  Terminology Definitions  During the early stages of work in the EP3R working groups, Participants have many times reported  that several words were lacking a clear definition and also a common understanding.  As a consequence, discussions were hanging on details to clarify, instead of allowing a seemless and  fluid debate.  The EP3R Working Group 1 on Key Assets therefore recommended that a Glossary is collegially  adopted by EP3R constituency as a reference for further works.  For these reasons the scope of the Task Force was focused on:  - Taking stock of existing Terminology definitions available freely (to avoid licencing issues);  - Identifying commonly used terms in the CIIP sector;  - Providing or reuse (where possible) for each term a simple and effective definition, avoiding  controversial definitions as much as possible.  - Using free sources for such definitions where available to build up their recommendations,  or get authorisation from relevant author(s).  The Deliverable of the TF was defined as follows in the EP3R Work Objectives:  - A list of Terms commonly used in the CIIP Industry;  EP3R 2013 – Position Paper  Task Forces on Terminology Definitions and Categorisation of Assets (TF-TDCA)  December 2013  Page  2  - A proposal of definition for each term, reusing where possible open and free dictionaries;  - A list of commonly used Sources in the ICT Sector.  Assets Categorisation  A risk assessment of the protection level of Critical Information Infrastructures depends initially on a  comprehensive inventory of all the components which constitute them.  These are generally referred to as “assets” and comprise equally physical and technical assets,  facilities, but also resources (e.g. supply chain), functions (i.e. Human operations), and regulatory  environment (e.g. Policies, Standards, etc).  A proper risk analysis approach would take into consideration any ingredient of the resulting service  operated, and assess each asset category’s risk occurrence and likelihood.  Since EP3R focuses on the proper operations of Critical Information Infrastructures (and unlike the  Art.13a regulation *not* on the services), the actual operations of the CII are under the initial scope  of reflection.  The Task force was requested to undertake all necessary actions to define a proper and useful  approach to the usage of CII stakeholders to ensure all Critical Assets supporting CIIs are  encompassed in risk analysis, business continuity planning and disaster recovery exercises, hence  ensuring proper preparedness and response capability for disasters or incidents.  This requirement arose following the presentation during an EP3R Plenary Session (December 2011)  of a major Telecom Operator’s Risk Management methodology.  Among the activities undertaken, the following have been considered:  - Taking stock on current practices in place in Member States for defining NCIs;  - Taking stock on Industry’s Risk Identification and Risk Management good practices;  - Evaluating the setup a reference framework and initiate a research activity on the  methodology for the identification of ECIIs. “Functional” supply chains could be identified  together with connections/ interconnections.  - Convergence to a final, simple result.  The Deliverable of the TF was defined as follows in the EP3R Work Objectives:  - A taxonomy of typical components which constitute a Critical Information Infrastructure.  - From the various methodologies proposed, select the parts relevant to Critical Information  Infrastructures Protection, and establish a formal recommendation for a set of criteria  allowing “Key Assets Identification”.  EP3R 2013 – Position Paper  Task Forces on Terminology Definitions and Categorisation of Assets (TF-TDCA)  December 2013  Page  3  2 Adoption of Terminology Sources  2.1 Key Terminology  During the discussions of the Task force it was decided to start addressing the issue using a  taxonomy approach. Due the short timeframe and the voluntary basis involvement it was considered  difficult to produce a comprehensive glossary covering all the possible terms. Therefore the TF  decided to give a clear and unique definition only of the most important concepts that represent the  foundations of all EP3R efforts.  The result is close to 160 definitions gathered  from free access sources, properly referenced,  and some definitions developed by the TF  members themselves when the existing ones  were not satisfactory.  For the broader glossary it was preferred to  define a first list of most common term and for  those not covered use taxonomy to  characterize the most important clusters and  bound them with the most relevant references  present in literature.  The following definitions were identified,  adopted by the Task Force, and used as  foundation for all discussions relating to  Critical Information Infrastructures.  2.2 Terminology Sources  While discussing the allocation, it was possible  to pinpoint the following list of references  from authoritative resources for each cluster.  The present list does not cover all the possible references but can allow the creation of a common  baseline in defining typical components which constitute a Critical Information Infrastructure.

The process of organising the terminology  required an initial assumption, and more  specifically to avoid reinventing the wheel.  It was suggested to use the 8 ingredients  mentioned in the MARIE report1 in order to  align this output with previous works and to  provide continuity both in scope and  terminology.  The full list of Categorised Terminology is  attached in Annex C.  The definition of an agreed common  terminology definition not only poses the  baseline for Categorization of assets, but  fosters also a the definition of mutual  efforts between cross-industry and cross- border communities. Basing the  terminology cluster reference on the  Mutual Aid for Resilient Infrastructure In  Europe (MARIE) eight ingredients provides a mutual starting point but also maximize the  convergence of the task forces outputs, starting with the establishment of proper Terminology in  each Category.  1  Rauscher, K.F., Krock, R.E. & Runyon, J.P., 2006.

During the  teleconferences several methods have been discussed in order to create an initial risk mapping  ontology in order to follow the path traced by existing literature2 regarding CI. Existing experiences  like the one in Finland3 and UK4 were cited as possible examples to refer to.  The initial idea was to focus on public networks and align the work with the Art 13a5 content, which  is the obligation for the Telecom Operators to report incidents. Therefore it was decided to proceed  initially with definitions of Critical Infrastructure / Critical Information Infrastructure / European  Critical Infrastructure.  Moreover the different business models that can be applied in the Telco sector  (fixed/mobile/connectivity provider) were emphasised and also the consequent different definitions  of criticality.  3.2 Initial Ontology  During the initial open teleconferences the task force decided to tackle the problem starting from  the differences between Internet Exchanges points (IXs) and manufacturers methodologies: IXs are  more focused on the physical and supply chain and the data/control plane repercussions, while  Manufacturers will concentrate on the meta-classification of specific assets.  Moreover the different business models that can be applied in the Telco sector  (fixed/mobile/connectivity provider) were emphasised and also the consequent different definitions  of criticality.  In the course of the proceedings and discussions with the experts it was decided to use primarily the  Mutual Aid for Resilient Infrastructure in Europe (MARIE) eight ingredients to align the output with  the other task forces.  This effort helps to draw a red line between the different goals and have a more holistic approach.  In the presented table the effort of the TF are sketched in order to give the an overview of the  possible different aspects that must be addressed.  The following ontology should therefore be viewed as a means of gaining a foothold in an extensive,  dynamic subject rather than as a statement of universally accepted fact.  2  JRC-IPSC, ’’Risk assessment methodologies for Critical Infrastructure Protection.

Thus by using the Mutual Aid for Resilient Infrastructure In Europe (MARIE) eight ingredients this  could be also connected with all the related literature and efforts and allow the interested parties to  foster collaboration based on the same terminology baseline. For this reason also the terminology  definition approach that follows makes use of the same categorisation.  The figure below shows a initial proposal classification of activities, assets and paves the way for  Terminology categorisation and development as well.

The Task Forces ran for two months, just before the EP3R was subsumed to the NIS  Platform.  This was actually the first attempt within the European Public Private Partnership for Resilience to  reach convergence points in Participants’ understanding, and allow to prevent many  misunderstandings as they used to happen in the past.  The Task Force acknowledges that this iteration solely addresses the Telecom Sector, and suggests  that it should be expanded to Sectors which depend on ICT, such as Health, Finance, Transports,  Energy.  But also, such definitions might be also needed for the specifics of CyberSecurity areas: Botnets,  Cyber Police, etc.  The process for each Sector should be similar, i.e. the identification of Terminology Sources relevant  to the Sector considered, submitting a consolidated listing of terms to a panel of Experts, and their  formal adoption of one definition per term.  Among the important uses of Terminology Definitions, the Task Force felt that Mutual Aid Assistance  was probably the most crucial, since all participants in the Agreement need to speak the same  language.  Some specifics of Mutual Aid Assistance should therefore be explored and a proper list of defined  terms adopted.  In the Working Groups meeting of the NIS Platform, a few participants raised the need for starting a  similar initiative. EP3R therefore hands over its initial conclusions so their starting point is already  more advanced than for EP3R, 4 years ago.

Bots are also known as \"zombies\".

Bots  are highly customizable so they can be programmed to do many things.  The major malicious activities include but are not limited to identity  theft, spam, spim (spam over Instant Messaging (IM)), spit (spam over  Internet telephony), email address harvesting, distributed denial-of- service (DDoS) attacks, key-logging, fraudulent DNS pharming  (redirection), hosting proxy services, fast flux hosting, hosting of illegal  content, use in man-in-the-middle attacks, and click fraud.

By way of introduction I would like to address the terms ‘digital’ and ‘industry’ and how ENISA is  building partnerships for leadership in the digital technology value chain.  Firstly Digital. The world is quickly embracing digital in every part of life. E-banking, e-health, e- commerce, e- education, e-everything are all now totally dependent on an open, safe and secure  cyberspace. We are witnessing the development and deployment of smart manufacturing, the  Internet of Things and computer controlled critical infrastructure. Digital is challenging the delivery  of old business models, while at the same time providing opportunities for the new world.  We see  new challenges to old business models, where for example mobile phone manufacturers and  internet search engine companies are moving into smart transport. Europe has to embrace this  challenge and take the lead in the digital revolution by delivering disruptive business models, using  innovative technologies and services, in a safe and secure manner. Europe has to ensure the trust  of its citizens and industry to have the necessary confidence to work with digital.  The delivery of Digital can be broken into three components, the generation of digital data, the  transmission of digital data from the generator of the data to the processor, and the storage of  digital data. ENISA is playing its role and is working on each of these components.  In terms of generating digital data ENISA is working on the security of smart homes/cities, the  computer control of our critical infrastructures, and e-health where digital monitoring of our health  on a 24 by 7 basis will improve the quality of all of our lives.  The transmission of data between the source and processor of the data is another critical part of  the digital chain. ENISA has recently taken an active role in addressing the question of encryption  and the importance of trusted secure communications of digital data as a key enabler of the internal  market. I can not imagine that the citizens of the EU adopting digital e-health technology unless  they had the trust, that their private data would only be accessible by their medical practitioners.  ENISA has recently published a paper1 on encryption on its web site and continues to contribute to  the debate on encryption.  The volume of data being generated in our digital world is growing at exponential levels. The  average computer for sale in the high street and online now holds terabytes of information.  What  this term means is that for every terabyte of storage there is 1000 million pieces of digital  information to be stored. It is against this background that the term Big Data has been invented.  One of the relatively new business models that has developed in the last few years to cope with the  volume of Big Data is the Cloud Computing business model. In this model citizens and industry can  have their data stored in a central location where the expertise, capacity and security should be  1 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/enisa-position-papers-and-opinions/enisa-position-on-crypto  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/enisa-position-papers-and-opinions/enisa-position-on-crypto  Cybersecurity and update from ENISA, Udo Helmbrecht ENISA  03  available to store the data in a secure manner. ENISA has been working in this area for a number of  years and has produced reports on good practice and guidance in the area of cloud computing.  ENISA is also conscious of the challenge for SMEs and has also produced reports tailored for their  needs. These reports help SMEs to address the additional challenges that they have in embracing  the digital revolution with more limited resources in comparison with large enterprises.  By way of a concluding remark on Digital, I would like to welcome and support the recent conclusion  and introduction of the General Data Protection Regulation. I believe that ENISA has an important  role to play in working with the EU data protection authorities and the European data protection  supervisory authority and I look forward to assisting in this work.  Secondly ‘Industry’. The importance of industry in the digital world cannot be underestimated. We  see Commission initiatives such as Innovation for Manufacturing SME (IM4S), H2020 and  Connected Europe Facility (CEF), promoting the next generation of research and development. Data  breaches, theft of intellectual property, sabotage of industrial processes are not new. What is  difficult is the quantifying of the losses that are occurring due to breaches in digital network and  information security.  In 2015 data breaches in the health sector have been estimated at almost 320 million euro2 and in  the financial sector around 12 billion euro3. The growth in the cybersecurity insurance market is  testament to the increasing realisation of the importance of this subject and the concern that CEOs  are increasingly attaching to cyber security. What is clear, is that cyberattacks are increasing, the  attacks are becoming more sophisticated, and the losses are escalating. ENISA is very conscious of  this and is willing and able to work with all EU stakeholders by forming partnerships to address the  challenge.  I would like to turn next to ‘leadership’. Leadership can be considered in terms of structural,  organisational and directional leadership. ENISA is participating in all of these aspects and is  bringing additional value by creating new partnerships. ENISA as a statutory body has the legal  remit to address network and information security at an EU level. At the organisational level, ENISA  is bringing together key stakeholders to promote network and information security.  Furthermore,  ENISA continues to build capabilities and capacity by engaging with public and private sector  stakeholders, to deliver pan European cyber exercises and pan European cyber training for  computer security incident response teams. These activities are reinforcing community building  among Member States, EU bodies and relevant Network and Information security stakeholders as  set down in the current draft of the NIS Directive.  ENISA has produced cutting edge reports to raise awareness and to offer best practice in cyber  security policies. All of these activities are having the effect of reducing digital silos across the  Union. At the directional leadership level, ENISA has become a centre of EU expertise where it is  2 https://www-01.ibm.com/marketing/iwm/dre/signup?source=ibm- WW_Security_Services&S_PKG=ov34982&S_TACT=000000NJ&S_OFF_CD=10000253  3 http://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/business-technology/our-insights/the-rising-strategic-risks-of- cyberattacks  https://www-01.ibm.com/marketing/iwm/dre/signup?source=ibm-WW_Security_Services&S_PKG=ov34982&S_TACT=000000NJ&S_OFF_CD=10000253 https://www-01.ibm.com/marketing/iwm/dre/signup?source=ibm-WW_Security_Services&S_PKG=ov34982&S_TACT=000000NJ&S_OFF_CD=10000253 http://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/business-technology/our-insights/the-rising-strategic-risks-of-cyberattacks http://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/business-technology/our-insights/the-rising-strategic-risks-of-cyberattacks  Cybersecurity and update from ENISA, Udo Helmbrecht ENISA  04  able to leverage the knowledge and support of the EU Commission, the 28 Member States and  industry participants.  I consider the diversity of different Member States approach to network and information security  as an advantage for Europe, and that ENISA has the unique role of bringing together this knowledge,  experience and willingness to work together for the benefit of EU industry and the citizens of the  EU. ENISA as the EU focus for network and information security is building expertise and facilitating  outreach to its stakeholders. ENISA is building public private partnerships with industry where the  knowledge of industry is being used to assist in the development of a culture of network and  information security and to encourage the importance and delivery of digital goods and services  that are fit for purpose and secure in their operation.  By way of some concluding remarks I would like to make some comments in relation to ENISA’s  contribution to this debate.  Firstly, ENISA has repeatedly called for security by design. EU technology needs to address security  of digital products as a market differentiator. Recognising that this will place an additional cost on  Industry, I believe that the importance of information security will prevail and the extra cost will be  justified in terms of consumer confidence. One supporting activity to achieve this objective is by  the use of appropriate security standards in public procurement.  Secondly, that ENISA facilitate greater coordination of network and information security standards  and certification with industry and the relevant standardisation bodies.  Thirdly, that ENISA fully participate in the Commission initiatives, such as the CEF program, to  leverage the legislative mandate that ENISA has in the area of network and information security,  particularly in the context of the forthcoming Network and Information Security Directive.  Fourthly, that ENISA continue to find and deliver network and information security exercises and  skills enhancement that are particularly relevant to be delivered on a pan EU basis.  ENISA is now 12 years old, contributing to one of the biggest challenges that modern society is  facing and is ready to work with all stakeholders to address these challenges at an EU level. I support  the work of Commissioner Oettinger in the delivery of his vision of an EU digital single market.  Finally, I would like to take this opportunity to thank the ITRE Committee and the European  Parliament for its support to date. I believe that ENISA is a key stakeholder in the delivery of an  open and secure EU cyber space. ENISA looks forward to playing its role in this important area of  network and information security for the benefit of industry and Europe’s citizens.  Thank you for your attention.

This does not mean that the security of  the IoT ecosystem as a whole has been addressed by means of standards. Elements of a holistic approach  towards IoT security can be found in a series of standards, however to achieve an overarching approach  that protects the entire IoT ecosystem further work is needed. Accordingly, given the particularity of the  IoT ecosystem (e.g. very high scalability, context of use, short time to market and cost drivers), this study  does not intend to promote a specific solution for the entire IoT. Conversely, by identifying and mapping  the existing standards landscape for IoT security, the study aims at pinpointing potential areas of  improvement and additional efforts in securing the IoT.  In general, there is an identifiable gap in process by which a vendor can assert that their IoT product or  service is secure. On the assertion that standards enable interoperability, the lack of cohesion on the use  and application of standards for secure IoT mean that interoperability is not guaranteed even if all devices  were to be placed on the market with security features enabled.  The primary argument of the present document is that standards are essential but not sufficient to ensure  open access to markets. In the particular case of security a large number of processes as well as technical  standards have to be in place to ensure that any device placed on the market is assuredly secure. In this  case the present document proposes, in Annex B, a theoretical approach towards a certification and  assurance and validation scheme to identify what is sufficient, as a precursor to allow for market access  through device, service and process certification. It should be noted that this approach is inherently  theoretical, since it does not take into account relevant concerns such as economic considerations that  might affect the viability of applying standards.  The process recommended in this document is intended in part to engender a change in attitude towards  device security by making secure IoT the only form of IoT that reaches the market and to give confidence  to the market through a mélange of certification, assurance testing & validation, and market surveillance.  The bulk of the material in the present report is contained in Annex A, the mapping of requirements to  available standards, and in Annex B, a proposal for the technical basis of market certification.  IoT Security Standards Gap Analysis  v1.0  |  December 2018  05  1. General information  Background and objectives of the study  In 2017, ENISA defined a set of Baseline Security Recommendations for IoT. The aim of this work was to  provide insight into the security requirements of IoT, mapping critical assets and relevant threats,  assessing possible attacks and identifying potential good practices and security measures to apply in order  to protect IoT systems.  Section 4 of this report – “Security measures and good practices” and Annex A – “Detailed Security  measures / Good practices” provide requirements on security and privacy. These requirements were  grouped and analysed in the context of standards available in each area, providing a mapping as the result.  In 2017 ENISA published a report “Gaps in NIS standardisation - Recommendations for improving NIS in EU  standardisation policy”, available at https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/gaps-eu-standardisation  The structure of that report has been considered as basis for this project.  The overall goal of the study is to map requirements on security and privacy in the area of IoT to existing  standards, identifying the gaps.  Scope of the study  This study analyses the gaps and provides guidelines for, in particular, the development or repositioning of  standards, facilitating the adoption of standards and governance of EU standardisation in the area of NIS.  ENISA brings in this relationship its technical and organisational know-how in NIS which can be further  leveraged into standards in terms of extending or assessing them to render them more appropriate to  stakeholders and more compliant with the prevailing regulatory framework.  Special attention is given to the EU needs related to emerging cybersecurity certification schemes which  will operate under the European cybersecurity certification framework. The framework is currently not  adopted1 but is expected to be finished at the end of this year. Standards or other widely adopted  technical specifications containing requirements form the basis for any certification activity. European  standards for security evaluation models, methods, techniques and tools adopted to the IoT world are  urgently needed to complement existing initiatives, good practices and industry guidelines on IoT security.  Related documents  The study is based on the following documents:  [1] ROLLING PLAN FOR ICT STANDARDISATION 2018, https://ec.europa.eu/growth/content/2018- rolling-plan-ict-standardisation-released_en  [2] Baseline Security Recommendations for IoT, Nov 20, 2017,  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/baseline-security-recommendations-for-iot  1  Proposal for a REGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL on ENISA, the \"EU Cybersecurity Agency\",  and repealing Regulation (EU) 526/2013, and on Information and Communication Technology cybersecurity certification  (\"Cybersecurity Act\")  IoT Security Standards Gap Analysis  v1.0  |  December 2018  06  Applied methodology  Several widely recognized standardization organizations have been surveyed to create a matrix which  combines subsequent requirements from Annex A of [2] and relevant standards.  Based on the analysis of leading standardization activities in the field of IoT given in [1], the matrix contains  inputs from:   Three European Standardization Organizations (ESO) ie. CEN, CENELEC and in particular ETSI TC  Cyber   ISO/IEC JTC1 subcommittees including SC27 (IT Security Techniques) and SC41 (Internet of  Things and related technologies)   ITU-T SERIES Y: GLOBAL INFORMATION INFRASTRUCTURE, INTERNET PROTOCOL ASPECTS AND  NEXT-GENERATION NETWORK.  The outcome is given in Annex A2.  IoT Security Standards Gap Analysis  v1.0  |  December 2018  07  2. Analysis of standards gap  The requirements listed in the ENISA report “Baseline Security Recommendations for IoT in the context of  Critical Information Infrastructures” have been mapped to an existing identifiable standard that if followed  would allow the requirement to be satisfied. The detailed, requirement by requirement, mapping is given  in Annex A.  The simplified analysis yields that there is no significant standards gap - every requirement can be met by  an existing standard. The problem is that this is neither the correct nor the expected answer. Standards  exist for many different elements of making a device or service secure. However, when referring to IoT,  one refers to an ecosystem of not only devices and services. Moreover, the context of use of IoT, its high  scalability and other particularities further complicate the field and require more generic and flexible  approaches. Therefore, for example the gap in IoT device standards for security is that the standards are  not treated holistically so it is possible to deliver a device to the market that can authenticate its user, that  can encrypt data it transmits, that can decrypt data it receives, that can deliver or verify the proof of  integrity, but which will still be insecure. Similarly, the organisation developing the IoT product or service  may have the development processes defined in management guidelines such as those of ISO-27000 but  still delivers an insecure product.  The challenge for regulators and suppliers alike is to bring only secure IoT devices to the market and this  requires a different approach, which will have to be flexible enough to accommodate for the nature of the  dynamic IoT ecosystem. Accepting that it is often speculation, there is a necessary challenge to imagine  how society will be in a few years from now and to consider the threats to society at that time. In order to  frame this, the broad assumption is that ICT will reach further into society with more connectivity, further  augmentation of everyday life through ICT, and this will demand an ICT and cybersecurity response. The  concerns of the next few years however stretch far beyond the remit of only security technology and many  of the recommendations in the present document extend to gaining better understanding of the societal  understanding of how ICT, and in particular, ICT incorporating cybersecurity impacts daily life.  Whereas this checklist of security requirements for IoT security and its mapping to specific standards can  serve as a springboard towards holistic and effective IoT security, it should be noted that the intricacies of  the IoT ecosystem call for more flexible approaches. Not only are the underlying technological challenges  calling for adaptive, context- and risk-based solutions, but also the IoT market constraints have to be taken  into account, so as not to hamper competitiveness and innovation.  IoT Security Standards Gap Analysis  v1.0  |  December 2018  08  3. The certification opportunity  The overall purpose of standards from the perspective of the market is twofold in defining what a standard  is intended to achieve: (1) interoperability, and (2) confidence.  The conventional role of standards in achieving interoperability is discussed in some length in Annex A and  is not repeated here.  The role of standards in the domain of trust is less well defined and in a security context is difficult to state  in simple terms. When referring to the IoT, one should not only consider individual devices. The inherent  connectivity and interdependencies of devices, services, people, process and data call for holistic  approaches. Accordingly, this implies a much more holistic view of the role of the device as opposed to a  relatively closed view of what standard does it comply to for say encryption.  Standards can be used for developing technical specifications in a specific context of a product type, and  provide a framework for security evaluation of products. Such general concept is presented in the figure  below.  As a representative use case example, we discuss here the case of the international standard ISO/IEC  15408 Evaluation criteria for IT security,  widely recognized as ‘Common Criteria’ (CC)2. CC consists of 3  parts including:   Part 1:  Introduction and general model   Part 2:  Security functional components   Part 3: Security assurance components  Based on the security model discussed in part 1 one can develop technical specifications, called – in CC  language – ‘protection profiles’ (PP) for the product type, or ‘security target’ (ST) for a given product. Such  specifications contain security requirements according to the formal taxonomy given in part 2 of CC, and  2 It should be underlined that this discussion is indicative and serve as an example, thus in no way implying any  preference towards the use of CC or any other standard in the IoT domain. This would require a far more thorough  analysis taking into account all related aspects and particularities, including the ones related to economics.  IoT Security Standards Gap Analysis  v1.0  |  December 2018  09  simultaneously create the evaluation requirements by using security assurance components given in part 3  of CC.  The evolution of CC from PP/ST through cPPs (collaborative Protection Profiles) and into the proposed  “Direct Rationale” approach from the Common Criteria group does provide a framework for a wider,  holistic view of security and therefore of confidence. The “Direct Rationale” approach provides a way of  producing comprehensive security specifications for products, which is simpler than a traditional one  hence it could be potentially applied in the IoT for preparing good technical specifications, giving  simultaneously the ground for providing requiring solid and proven confidence the product meets security  requirements.  The opportunity to drive market confidence in security of IoT may be developed from the work outlined in  evolution of the Common Criteria (see also a detail examination in Annex B) to propose to all ICT security  developing SDOs, to work towards cPPs and from there to work in the Direct Rationale cPP development.  Evidently, the example use case of CC can be considered for other standards when it comes to IoT. As  mentioned, there is a growing call for flexible and adaptive solutions in this environment and therefore a  complete analysis is beyond the scope of this report.  There is an opportunity to develop standards that have to be testable and that will be cited in the  certification chain as proof of assurance. A subtle assertion is that if you comply with a standard, and that  standard is properly maintained, then conformance is sufficient. Less obvious is that the proof of security  assurance will require many standards to be conformed to.  IoT Security Standards Gap Analysis  v1.0  |  December 2018  10  Annex A: Mapping of requirements to standards  A.1 Role of standardisation  A.1.1 General overview  In the context of IoT devices, a broad generalisation of the role of standards is that their role is to provide  interoperability of \"things\". It is also a broad generalisation that standards provide requirements to be met  and do not provide instructions on how to implement a requirement. For security standards these  statements apply as a broad interpretation but with the slight modification that many security standards,  or more likely the security functions defined in standards, give assurance of the interoperability of \"things\"  when subject to attack by hostile parties. Thus standards may address functionality (e.g. an encryption  algorithm), application of that functionality (e.g. use of specific encryption mode (say counter mode)), and  contextual use of that functionality (e.g. application of encryption to provision of confidentiality protection  services).  Entities involved in cryptographic security that are required to interoperate will also require sharing  knowledge and functionality that will include the identification of keys and algorithms. Thus security  standards have to address simple mechanical interconnection, semantic and syntactic shared meaning,  and management of attributes and organisations to react to security transgressions in an appropriate  manner.  A.1.2 Organisational interoperability  There is a class of organisational management standards in security that defines roles within organisations  that seek to enforce a \"need to know\". From a security perspective when two organisations share data  they may transfer data securely by having a common Communications Security (ComSec) framework, but  the ComSec exchange cannot make any inference on how data is treated prior to, or after, transfer. Thus  the local IT security policy of the sending and receiving organisations is trusted to be equivalent and this  trust may be reinforced by external measures.  A.1.3 Syntactic interoperability  Syntax derives from the Greek word meaning ordering and arrangement. The English language sentence  structure of subject-verb-object is a simple example of syntax, and generally in formal language syntax is  the set of rules that allows a well formed expression to be formed from a fundamental set of symbols. In  computing science syntax refers to the normative structure of data. In order to achieve syntactic  interoperability there has to be a shared understanding of the symbol set and of the ordering of symbols.  In any language the dictionary of symbols is restricted, thus in general a verb should not be misconstrued  as a noun for example (although there are particularly glaring examples of misuse that have become  normal use, e.g. the use of \"medal\" as a verb wherein the conventional text \"He won a medal\" has now  been abused as \"He medalled\").  A.1.4 Semantic interoperability  Syntax cannot convey meaning and this is where semantics is introduced.  Semantics derives meaning from  syntactically correct statements. Semantic understanding itself is dependent on both pragmatics and  context. There are a number of ways of exchanging semantic information although the success is  dependent on structuring data to optimise the availability of semantic content and the transfer of  contextual knowledge (although the transfer of pragmatics is less clear). The most obvious examples of  semantic containers for syntactically correct information are protocols whereby the protocol (e.g. an  IoT Security Standards Gap Analysis  v1.0  |  December 2018  11  authentication protocol) gives context to message sets. This may be further extended using the concept of  shared state as a means of identifying context and this is often embedded in protocol (e.g. an  authentication protocol may go through states that include \"Identified\", \"Challenge issued\", \"Response  pending\" prior to finalising on the state \"Authenticated\").  A.1.5 Electrical and mechanical interoperability  Quite simply a device with a power connector using, for example, a Type IEC 60906-2 connection cannot  accept power from anything other than a Type IEC 60906-2 connector. Similarly, for example, a serial port  complying to USB-Type-A will not be able to connect with a USB-Type-C lead. In addition to simple  mechanical compatibility there is a requirement to ensure electrical interoperability covering amongst  others the voltage level, amperage level, DC or AC, frequency if AC, variation levels and so forth.  A.1.6 Radio communication interoperability  Radio (wireless) communication requires shared knowledge of frequency band, modulation technique,  symbol rate, power, and so forth. In general radio communication can be characterised as broadcast and  unreliable. The nature of the physical media requires that radio protocols make provisions to maximise link  reliability, most often achieved using various forms of Forward Error Correction in the Link Layer (layer 2 of  the OSI stack).  Gaps in standardisation  It is recognised that whilst there are a very large number of bodies that develop standards it is also  recognised that most service providers, manufacturers and governments are involved in a significant  number of them. This unfortunately also means that as each standards body is in competition with each  other, that there is overlap in capability and of itself this constitutes a risk to security.  ASSERTION: Gaps in standards present risk that additional standardisation effort may mitigate, but  overlaps in standardisation effort present risk that may not be mitigated by additional standardisation  effort but rather by agreed reduction, or redaction of existing standards.

The proposal presented below is to develop a processthat alongside some  certification marking on IoT products and services, that gives assurance to the market that the IoT product  is as secure as can be reasonably expected. As an example of how this process could work, we consider the  case of Common Criteria (standardized in ISO/IEC 15408). It should be noted that this example does not  imply that CC is an optimal or preferred approach in the context of IoT and serves only as an example to  illustrate the generic process.  Accordingly, the overall concept is intended to build from best practice in evaluation of security claims that  derive from the Common Criteria and to ensure that developers address how security claims will be  evaluated both by professional evaluators and by the market. In the past (from 2010 roughly) ETSI has  promoted a paradigm of “design for assurance” that has considered this form of development to ensure  that developers undertake a risk analysis and provide a rationale for every security mechanism  standardized for a product or service, whilst making clear the security claims of the protocol.  Conventional development of ST or PP  ISO/IEC 15408-1 contains detailed guidance on the development of technical specifications in the form of  general description of the product type, called Protection Profile (PP) or dedicated one, called Security  Target (ST). A product that is then characterized as a Target of Evaluation (ToE) and which has been  developed according to content of either an ST or a PP could be the subject for further security evaluation.  If an evaluator agrees that the ToE (the product) conforms to the claims made in the ST/PP then it is  reasonable to claim the ToE (the product) is secure within the constraints described in the ST/PP. The  process of developing security requirement for the ST/PP encompass several steps which are presented in  Figure B.1 (numbers indicate steps in the process of producing the specification).  IoT Security Standards Gap Analysis  v1.0  |  December 2018  24  Figure B.1: Regular approach to producing a technical specification (ST or PP)  The outcome of this process usually results in a lengthy technical specification which is difficult to  understand for non-experienced users.  The idea of simplification of this time- and resource consuming process is present in the current version of  ISO/IEC 15408-1 under the name of ‘low assurance’ ST/PP. However, its usage is restricted to the lowest  level of assurance, i.e. EAL1 and only briefly discussed in the standard.  In a revised version of ISO/IEC 15408-1 the concept of ‘low assurance’ is replaced with a ‘direct rationale’  one. However, it is not only changing the name but the approach as well. The direct rationale is now one of  the type of PP/ST with simplifying method of creating specifications. Moreover, it is not restricted to low  assurance packages but can request a higher level of assurance.  Direct rationale approach for creating simpler and faster specifications  By definition, ‘direct rationale’ means a type of Protection Profile or Security Target in which the Security  Problem Definition (SPD) elements (i.e. of Assumptions, Threats and Organizational Security Policies) are  mapped directly to the Security Functional Requirements (SFRs) and, possibly Security Objectives for the  operational environment (see Figure B.2).  IoT Security Standards Gap Analysis  v1.0  |  December 2018  25  Fig.  2 Using a 'Direct rationale' approach to create technical specifications  A Direct Rationale ST has all the following differences compared to a regular ST:   no Security Objectives for the TOE are described. The Security Objectives for the operational  environment must still be described;   there is no Security Objectives rationale as there are no TOE Security Objectives in the ST;   there is a requirement to provide natural language description of the SFRs and their relationship to  security functionality regarding the architecture that is visible to Administrators and other users;   the security requirements rationale directly maps the elements of the SPD to the SFRs and the Security  Objectives for the operational environment.  A Direct Rationale PP has the same simplifications about a regular PP like a Direct Rationale ST to a regular  ST.  Several ‘direct rationale’ PPs exist3 and are in use as a base for Direct Rationale ST.  In the case of Direct Rationale ST/PP, Security Assurance Requirements (SARs) are usually not related to  pre-defined Evaluation Assurance Levels (EALs). Instead of, there is a list of specific assurance components  suitable for the specification. When the TOE is evaluated, there is no need to check every assurance  3 See for example, collaborative Protection Profile for Full Drive 2 Encryption - Encryption Engine  (https://www.commoncriteriaportal.org/files/ppfiles/CPP_FDE_EE_V2.0.pdf),  collaborative Protection Profile for Full Drive Encryption – Authorization Acquisition v2.0  (https://www.commoncriteriaportal.org/files/ppfiles/CPP_FDE_AA_V2.0.pdf)  IoT Security Standards Gap Analysis  v1.0  |  December 2018  26  component from the package. Such an approach could make evaluations faster and more cost-efficient  than traditional ones.  In specific contexts, applicable to simple devices or products with a short Time-to-Market parameter or  intended to be produced on a massive scale, the direct rationale approach could be a useful solution.  Composite evaluations suitable for IoT devices  The revised ISO/IEC 15408 series of standards also provides flexible approaches to evaluations, which  could be potentially prove to be suitable for the IoT world. This approach is called a ‘composite evaluation’.  The composite evaluation takes place where one considers a product comprised of two or more  components which can be organized in two layers: a layer of autonomous base component(s) and a layer  of dependent components. The composite evaluation can be applied as many times as necessary to a  multi-component/multi-layered product, in an incremental approach.  The composite product evaluation meets different types of objectives:   independently perform one evaluation of a platform to address several applications and customers;   create one or several applications to load on one or several certified platforms;   install one or several applications onto one already certified platform to reduce the evaluation effort  keeping a high level of confidence.  Composite evaluations have been developed for the smart card world as shown in Figure B.3 and appeared  to be the most successful implementation of the CC certifications. Such an approach allows developers and  evaluators to re-use results from previous evaluations thus reduce the time and cost the current one.  Figure B. 3 Composite product evaluation in the smart card environment  Several constraints should be applied to the product development regarding conformity to take benefits  from the re-use approach, but detailed discussion on this issue is outside the scope.  Considering layered architecture of certain IoT devices the composite evaluation approach introduced in  the revised version of ISO/IEC 15408-1 could be under circumstances seen to be applicable to the IoT  world.  IoT Security Standards Gap Analysis  v1.0  |  December 2018  27  A general architecture of an IoT device concerning the composite evaluation4 is presented in Figure B.4.  Figure B.4 Layered architecture of the IoT product with the concept of re-used evaluation results  The concept of ‘root of trust’  establish a base for cost-efficient security evaluations based on previously  certified HW or HW-SW components and thus creates a highly controlled environment to execute higher  layers of the IoT device architecture.  44 The figure is adopted from Vetillard, E., Stütz, G., “Common Criteria as Backbone for IoT Security Certification”, the  17th International Common Criteria Conference (ICCC) Amsterdam, 30 Oct – 01 Nov 2018  IoT Security Standards Gap Analysis  v1.0  |  December 2018  28  ENISA  European Union Agency for Network  and Information Security  1 Vasilissis Sofias  Marousi 151 24, Attiki, Greece  Heraklion Office  Science and Technology Park of Crete (ITE)  Vassilika Vouton, 700 13, Heraklion, Greece  Catalogue Number TP-07-18-076-EN-N  1 Vasilissis Sofias Str, Maroussi 151 24, Attiki, Greece  Tel: +30 28 14 40 9710  info@enisa.europa.eu  www.enisa.europa.eu  ISBN: 978-92-9204-275-2  DOI: 10.2824/713380",

This does not mean that the security of  the IoT ecosystem as a whole has been addressed by means of standards. Elements of a holistic approach  towards IoT security can be found in a series of standards, however to achieve an overarching approach  that protects the entire IoT ecosystem further work is needed. Accordingly, given the particularity of the  IoT ecosystem (e.g. very high scalability, context of use, short time to market and cost drivers), this study  does not intend to promote a specific solution for the entire IoT. Conversely, by identifying and mapping  the existing standards landscape for IoT security, the study aims at pinpointing potential areas of  improvement and additional efforts in securing the IoT.  In general, there is an identifiable gap in process by which a vendor can assert that their IoT product or  service is secure. On the assertion that standards enable interoperability, the lack of cohesion on the use  and application of standards for secure IoT mean that interoperability is not guaranteed even if all devices  were to be placed on the market with security features enabled.  The primary argument of the present document is that standards are essential but not sufficient to ensure  open access to markets. In the particular case of security a large number of processes as well as technical  standards have to be in place to ensure that any device placed on the market is assuredly secure. In this  case the present document proposes, in Annex B, a theoretical approach towards a certification and  assurance and validation scheme to identify what is sufficient, as a precursor to allow for market access  through device, service and process certification. It should be noted that this approach is inherently  theoretical, since it does not take into account relevant concerns such as economic considerations that  might affect the viability of applying standards.  The process recommended in this document is intended in part to engender a change in attitude towards  device security by making secure IoT the only form of IoT that reaches the market and to give confidence  to the market through a mélange of certification, assurance testing & validation, and market surveillance.  The bulk of the material in the present report is contained in Annex A, the mapping of requirements to  available standards, and in Annex B, a proposal for the technical basis of market certification.  IoT Security Standards Gap Analysis  v1.0  |  December 2018  05  1. General information  Background and objectives of the study  In 2017, ENISA defined a set of Baseline Security Recommendations for IoT. The aim of this work was to  provide insight into the security requirements of IoT, mapping critical assets and relevant threats,  assessing possible attacks and identifying potential good practices and security measures to apply in order  to protect IoT systems.  Section 4 of this report – “Security measures and good practices” and Annex A – “Detailed Security  measures / Good practices” provide requirements on security and privacy. These requirements were  grouped and analysed in the context of standards available in each area, providing a mapping as the result.  In 2017 ENISA published a report “Gaps in NIS standardisation - Recommendations for improving NIS in EU  standardisation policy”, available at https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/gaps-eu-standardisation  The structure of that report has been considered as basis for this project.  The overall goal of the study is to map requirements on security and privacy in the area of IoT to existing  standards, identifying the gaps.  Scope of the study  This study analyses the gaps and provides guidelines for, in particular, the development or repositioning of  standards, facilitating the adoption of standards and governance of EU standardisation in the area of NIS.  ENISA brings in this relationship its technical and organisational know-how in NIS which can be further  leveraged into standards in terms of extending or assessing them to render them more appropriate to  stakeholders and more compliant with the prevailing regulatory framework.  Special attention is given to the EU needs related to emerging cybersecurity certification schemes which  will operate under the European cybersecurity certification framework. The framework is currently not  adopted1 but is expected to be finished at the end of this year. Standards or other widely adopted  technical specifications containing requirements form the basis for any certification activity. European  standards for security evaluation models, methods, techniques and tools adopted to the IoT world are  urgently needed to complement existing initiatives, good practices and industry guidelines on IoT security.  Related documents  The study is based on the following documents:  [1] ROLLING PLAN FOR ICT STANDARDISATION 2018, https://ec.europa.eu/growth/content/2018- rolling-plan-ict-standardisation-released_en  [2] Baseline Security Recommendations for IoT, Nov 20, 2017,  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/baseline-security-recommendations-for-iot  1  Proposal for a REGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL on ENISA, the \"EU Cybersecurity Agency\",  and repealing Regulation (EU) 526/2013, and on Information and Communication Technology cybersecurity certification  (\"Cybersecurity Act\")  IoT Security Standards Gap Analysis  v1.0  |  December 2018  06  Applied methodology  Several widely recognized standardization organizations have been surveyed to create a matrix which  combines subsequent requirements from Annex A of [2] and relevant standards.  Based on the analysis of leading standardization activities in the field of IoT given in [1], the matrix contains  inputs from:   Three European Standardization Organizations (ESO) ie. CEN, CENELEC and in particular ETSI TC  Cyber   ISO/IEC JTC1 subcommittees including SC27 (IT Security Techniques) and SC41 (Internet of  Things and related technologies)   ITU-T SERIES Y: GLOBAL INFORMATION INFRASTRUCTURE, INTERNET PROTOCOL ASPECTS AND  NEXT-GENERATION NETWORK.  The outcome is given in Annex A2.  IoT Security Standards Gap Analysis  v1.0  |  December 2018  07  2. Analysis of standards gap  The requirements listed in the ENISA report “Baseline Security Recommendations for IoT in the context of  Critical Information Infrastructures” have been mapped to an existing identifiable standard that if followed  would allow the requirement to be satisfied. The detailed, requirement by requirement, mapping is given  in Annex A.  The simplified analysis yields that there is no significant standards gap - every requirement can be met by  an existing standard. The problem is that this is neither the correct nor the expected answer. Standards  exist for many different elements of making a device or service secure. However, when referring to IoT,  one refers to an ecosystem of not only devices and services. Moreover, the context of use of IoT, its high  scalability and other particularities further complicate the field and require more generic and flexible  approaches. Therefore, for example the gap in IoT device standards for security is that the standards are  not treated holistically so it is possible to deliver a device to the market that can authenticate its user, that  can encrypt data it transmits, that can decrypt data it receives, that can deliver or verify the proof of  integrity, but which will still be insecure. Similarly, the organisation developing the IoT product or service  may have the development processes defined in management guidelines such as those of ISO-27000 but  still delivers an insecure product.  The challenge for regulators and suppliers alike is to bring only secure IoT devices to the market and this  requires a different approach, which will have to be flexible enough to accommodate for the nature of the  dynamic IoT ecosystem. Accepting that it is often speculation, there is a necessary challenge to imagine  how society will be in a few years from now and to consider the threats to society at that time. In order to  frame this, the broad assumption is that ICT will reach further into society with more connectivity, further  augmentation of everyday life through ICT, and this will demand an ICT and cybersecurity response. The  concerns of the next few years however stretch far beyond the remit of only security technology and many  of the recommendations in the present document extend to gaining better understanding of the societal  understanding of how ICT, and in particular, ICT incorporating cybersecurity impacts daily life.  Whereas this checklist of security requirements for IoT security and its mapping to specific standards can  serve as a springboard towards holistic and effective IoT security, it should be noted that the intricacies of  the IoT ecosystem call for more flexible approaches. Not only are the underlying technological challenges  calling for adaptive, context- and risk-based solutions, but also the IoT market constraints have to be taken  into account, so as not to hamper competitiveness and innovation.  IoT Security Standards Gap Analysis  v1.0  |  December 2018  08  3. The certification opportunity  The overall purpose of standards from the perspective of the market is twofold in defining what a standard  is intended to achieve: (1) interoperability, and (2) confidence.  The conventional role of standards in achieving interoperability is discussed in some length in Annex A and  is not repeated here.  The role of standards in the domain of trust is less well defined and in a security context is difficult to state  in simple terms. When referring to the IoT, one should not only consider individual devices. The inherent  connectivity and interdependencies of devices, services, people, process and data call for holistic  approaches. Accordingly, this implies a much more holistic view of the role of the device as opposed to a  relatively closed view of what standard does it comply to for say encryption.  Standards can be used for developing technical specifications in a specific context of a product type, and  provide a framework for security evaluation of products. Such general concept is presented in the figure  below.  As a representative use case example, we discuss here the case of the international standard ISO/IEC  15408 Evaluation criteria for IT security,  widely recognized as ‘Common Criteria’ (CC)2. CC consists of 3  parts including:   Part 1:  Introduction and general model   Part 2:  Security functional components   Part 3: Security assurance components  Based on the security model discussed in part 1 one can develop technical specifications, called – in CC  language – ‘protection profiles’ (PP) for the product type, or ‘security target’ (ST) for a given product. Such  specifications contain security requirements according to the formal taxonomy given in part 2 of CC, and  2 It should be underlined that this discussion is indicative and serve as an example, thus in no way implying any  preference towards the use of CC or any other standard in the IoT domain. This would require a far more thorough  analysis taking into account all related aspects and particularities, including the ones related to economics.  IoT Security Standards Gap Analysis  v1.0  |  December 2018  09  simultaneously create the evaluation requirements by using security assurance components given in part 3  of CC.  The evolution of CC from PP/ST through cPPs (collaborative Protection Profiles) and into the proposed  “Direct Rationale” approach from the Common Criteria group does provide a framework for a wider,  holistic view of security and therefore of confidence. The “Direct Rationale” approach provides a way of  producing comprehensive security specifications for products, which is simpler than a traditional one  hence it could be potentially applied in the IoT for preparing good technical specifications, giving  simultaneously the ground for providing requiring solid and proven confidence the product meets security  requirements.  The opportunity to drive market confidence in security of IoT may be developed from the work outlined in  evolution of the Common Criteria (see also a detail examination in Annex B) to propose to all ICT security  developing SDOs, to work towards cPPs and from there to work in the Direct Rationale cPP development.  Evidently, the example use case of CC can be considered for other standards when it comes to IoT. As  mentioned, there is a growing call for flexible and adaptive solutions in this environment and therefore a  complete analysis is beyond the scope of this report.  There is an opportunity to develop standards that have to be testable and that will be cited in the  certification chain as proof of assurance. A subtle assertion is that if you comply with a standard, and that  standard is properly maintained, then conformance is sufficient. Less obvious is that the proof of security  assurance will require many standards to be conformed to.  IoT Security Standards Gap Analysis  v1.0  |  December 2018  10  Annex A: Mapping of requirements to standards  A.1 Role of standardisation  A.1.1 General overview  In the context of IoT devices, a broad generalisation of the role of standards is that their role is to provide  interoperability of \"things\". It is also a broad generalisation that standards provide requirements to be met  and do not provide instructions on how to implement a requirement. For security standards these  statements apply as a broad interpretation but with the slight modification that many security standards,  or more likely the security functions defined in standards, give assurance of the interoperability of \"things\"  when subject to attack by hostile parties. Thus standards may address functionality (e.g. an encryption  algorithm), application of that functionality (e.g. use of specific encryption mode (say counter mode)), and  contextual use of that functionality (e.g. application of encryption to provision of confidentiality protection  services).  Entities involved in cryptographic security that are required to interoperate will also require sharing  knowledge and functionality that will include the identification of keys and algorithms. Thus security  standards have to address simple mechanical interconnection, semantic and syntactic shared meaning,  and management of attributes and organisations to react to security transgressions in an appropriate  manner.  A.1.2 Organisational interoperability  There is a class of organisational management standards in security that defines roles within organisations  that seek to enforce a \"need to know\". From a security perspective when two organisations share data  they may transfer data securely by having a common Communications Security (ComSec) framework, but  the ComSec exchange cannot make any inference on how data is treated prior to, or after, transfer. Thus  the local IT security policy of the sending and receiving organisations is trusted to be equivalent and this  trust may be reinforced by external measures.  A.1.3 Syntactic interoperability  Syntax derives from the Greek word meaning ordering and arrangement. The English language sentence  structure of subject-verb-object is a simple example of syntax, and generally in formal language syntax is  the set of rules that allows a well formed expression to be formed from a fundamental set of symbols. In  computing science syntax refers to the normative structure of data. In order to achieve syntactic  interoperability there has to be a shared understanding of the symbol set and of the ordering of symbols.  In any language the dictionary of symbols is restricted, thus in general a verb should not be misconstrued  as a noun for example (although there are particularly glaring examples of misuse that have become  normal use, e.g. the use of \"medal\" as a verb wherein the conventional text \"He won a medal\" has now  been abused as \"He medalled\").  A.1.4 Semantic interoperability  Syntax cannot convey meaning and this is where semantics is introduced.  Semantics derives meaning from  syntactically correct statements. Semantic understanding itself is dependent on both pragmatics and  context. There are a number of ways of exchanging semantic information although the success is  dependent on structuring data to optimise the availability of semantic content and the transfer of  contextual knowledge (although the transfer of pragmatics is less clear). The most obvious examples of  semantic containers for syntactically correct information are protocols whereby the protocol (e.g. an  IoT Security Standards Gap Analysis  v1.0  |  December 2018  11  authentication protocol) gives context to message sets. This may be further extended using the concept of  shared state as a means of identifying context and this is often embedded in protocol (e.g. an  authentication protocol may go through states that include \"Identified\", \"Challenge issued\", \"Response  pending\" prior to finalising on the state \"Authenticated\").  A.1.5 Electrical and mechanical interoperability  Quite simply a device with a power connector using, for example, a Type IEC 60906-2 connection cannot  accept power from anything other than a Type IEC 60906-2 connector. Similarly, for example, a serial port  complying to USB-Type-A will not be able to connect with a USB-Type-C lead. In addition to simple  mechanical compatibility there is a requirement to ensure electrical interoperability covering amongst  others the voltage level, amperage level, DC or AC, frequency if AC, variation levels and so forth.  A.1.6 Radio communication interoperability  Radio (wireless) communication requires shared knowledge of frequency band, modulation technique,  symbol rate, power, and so forth. In general radio communication can be characterised as broadcast and  unreliable. The nature of the physical media requires that radio protocols make provisions to maximise link  reliability, most often achieved using various forms of Forward Error Correction in the Link Layer (layer 2 of  the OSI stack).  Gaps in standardisation  It is recognised that whilst there are a very large number of bodies that develop standards it is also  recognised that most service providers, manufacturers and governments are involved in a significant  number of them. This unfortunately also means that as each standards body is in competition with each  other, that there is overlap in capability and of itself this constitutes a risk to security.  ASSERTION: Gaps in standards present risk that additional standardisation effort may mitigate, but  overlaps in standardisation effort present risk that may not be mitigated by additional standardisation  effort but rather by agreed reduction, or redaction of existing standards.

The proposal presented below is to develop a processthat alongside some  certification marking on IoT products and services, that gives assurance to the market that the IoT product  is as secure as can be reasonably expected. As an example of how this process could work, we consider the  case of Common Criteria (standardized in ISO/IEC 15408). It should be noted that this example does not  imply that CC is an optimal or preferred approach in the context of IoT and serves only as an example to  illustrate the generic process.  Accordingly, the overall concept is intended to build from best practice in evaluation of security claims that  derive from the Common Criteria and to ensure that developers address how security claims will be  evaluated both by professional evaluators and by the market. In the past (from 2010 roughly) ETSI has  promoted a paradigm of “design for assurance” that has considered this form of development to ensure  that developers undertake a risk analysis and provide a rationale for every security mechanism  standardized for a product or service, whilst making clear the security claims of the protocol.  Conventional development of ST or PP  ISO/IEC 15408-1 contains detailed guidance on the development of technical specifications in the form of  general description of the product type, called Protection Profile (PP) or dedicated one, called Security  Target (ST). A product that is then characterized as a Target of Evaluation (ToE) and which has been  developed according to content of either an ST or a PP could be the subject for further security evaluation.  If an evaluator agrees that the ToE (the product) conforms to the claims made in the ST/PP then it is  reasonable to claim the ToE (the product) is secure within the constraints described in the ST/PP. The  process of developing security requirement for the ST/PP encompass several steps which are presented in  Figure B.1 (numbers indicate steps in the process of producing the specification).  IoT Security Standards Gap Analysis  v1.0  |  December 2018  24  Figure B.1: Regular approach to producing a technical specification (ST or PP)  The outcome of this process usually results in a lengthy technical specification which is difficult to  understand for non-experienced users.  The idea of simplification of this time- and resource consuming process is present in the current version of  ISO/IEC 15408-1 under the name of ‘low assurance’ ST/PP. However, its usage is restricted to the lowest  level of assurance, i.e. EAL1 and only briefly discussed in the standard.  In a revised version of ISO/IEC 15408-1 the concept of ‘low assurance’ is replaced with a ‘direct rationale’  one. However, it is not only changing the name but the approach as well. The direct rationale is now one of  the type of PP/ST with simplifying method of creating specifications. Moreover, it is not restricted to low  assurance packages but can request a higher level of assurance.  Direct rationale approach for creating simpler and faster specifications  By definition, ‘direct rationale’ means a type of Protection Profile or Security Target in which the Security  Problem Definition (SPD) elements (i.e. of Assumptions, Threats and Organizational Security Policies) are  mapped directly to the Security Functional Requirements (SFRs) and, possibly Security Objectives for the  operational environment (see Figure B.2).  IoT Security Standards Gap Analysis  v1.0  |  December 2018  25  Fig.  2 Using a 'Direct rationale' approach to create technical specifications  A Direct Rationale ST has all the following differences compared to a regular ST:   no Security Objectives for the TOE are described. The Security Objectives for the operational  environment must still be described;   there is no Security Objectives rationale as there are no TOE Security Objectives in the ST;   there is a requirement to provide natural language description of the SFRs and their relationship to  security functionality regarding the architecture that is visible to Administrators and other users;   the security requirements rationale directly maps the elements of the SPD to the SFRs and the Security  Objectives for the operational environment.  A Direct Rationale PP has the same simplifications about a regular PP like a Direct Rationale ST to a regular  ST.  Several ‘direct rationale’ PPs exist3 and are in use as a base for Direct Rationale ST.  In the case of Direct Rationale ST/PP, Security Assurance Requirements (SARs) are usually not related to  pre-defined Evaluation Assurance Levels (EALs). Instead of, there is a list of specific assurance components  suitable for the specification. When the TOE is evaluated, there is no need to check every assurance  3 See for example, collaborative Protection Profile for Full Drive 2 Encryption - Encryption Engine  (https://www.commoncriteriaportal.org/files/ppfiles/CPP_FDE_EE_V2.0.pdf),  collaborative Protection Profile for Full Drive Encryption – Authorization Acquisition v2.0  (https://www.commoncriteriaportal.org/files/ppfiles/CPP_FDE_AA_V2.0.pdf)  IoT Security Standards Gap Analysis  v1.0  |  December 2018  26  component from the package. Such an approach could make evaluations faster and more cost-efficient  than traditional ones.  In specific contexts, applicable to simple devices or products with a short Time-to-Market parameter or  intended to be produced on a massive scale, the direct rationale approach could be a useful solution.  Composite evaluations suitable for IoT devices  The revised ISO/IEC 15408 series of standards also provides flexible approaches to evaluations, which  could be potentially prove to be suitable for the IoT world. This approach is called a ‘composite evaluation’.  The composite evaluation takes place where one considers a product comprised of two or more  components which can be organized in two layers: a layer of autonomous base component(s) and a layer  of dependent components. The composite evaluation can be applied as many times as necessary to a  multi-component/multi-layered product, in an incremental approach.  The composite product evaluation meets different types of objectives:   independently perform one evaluation of a platform to address several applications and customers;   create one or several applications to load on one or several certified platforms;   install one or several applications onto one already certified platform to reduce the evaluation effort  keeping a high level of confidence.  Composite evaluations have been developed for the smart card world as shown in Figure B.3 and appeared  to be the most successful implementation of the CC certifications. Such an approach allows developers and  evaluators to re-use results from previous evaluations thus reduce the time and cost the current one.  Figure B. 3 Composite product evaluation in the smart card environment  Several constraints should be applied to the product development regarding conformity to take benefits  from the re-use approach, but detailed discussion on this issue is outside the scope.  Considering layered architecture of certain IoT devices the composite evaluation approach introduced in  the revised version of ISO/IEC 15408-1 could be under circumstances seen to be applicable to the IoT  world.  IoT Security Standards Gap Analysis  v1.0  |  December 2018  27  A general architecture of an IoT device concerning the composite evaluation4 is presented in Figure B.4.  Figure B.4 Layered architecture of the IoT product with the concept of re-used evaluation results  The concept of ‘root of trust’  establish a base for cost-efficient security evaluations based on previously  certified HW or HW-SW components and thus creates a highly controlled environment to execute higher  layers of the IoT device architecture.  44 The figure is adopted from Vetillard, E., Stütz, G., “Common Criteria as Backbone for IoT Security Certification”, the  17th International Common Criteria Conference (ICCC) Amsterdam, 30 Oct – 01 Nov 2018  IoT Security Standards Gap Analysis  v1.0  |  December 2018  28  ENISA  European Union Agency for Network  and Information Security  1 Vasilissis Sofias  Marousi 151 24, Attiki, Greece  Heraklion Office  Science and Technology Park of Crete (ITE)  Vassilika Vouton, 700 13, Heraklion, Greece  Catalogue Number TP-07-18-076-EN-N  1 Vasilissis Sofias Str, Maroussi 151 24, Attiki, Greece  Tel: +30 28 14 40 9710  info@enisa.europa.eu  www.enisa.europa.eu  ISBN: 978-92-9204-275-2  DOI: 10.2824/713380",

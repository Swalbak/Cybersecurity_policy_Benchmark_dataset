Mitigating the impact of security incidents  Guidelines for trust services providers – Part 3  Version 1.0 – December 2013  Page  iv  Executive summary  E-Government services have significant potential to make public services more efficient for the  benefit of citizens and businesses in terms of time and money. And while these benefits are  increasingly being felt nationally, e-Government services still face administrative and legal barriers  on a cross-border level, although pan-European projects like STORK2 have shown that technical  issues of interoperability of electronic identifications can be overcome. In order to remove existing  barriers for cross-border e-ID based services the European Commission has proposed in June 2012 a  draft regulation on electronic identification and trust services for electronic transactions in the  internal market [38], which will replace the existing Electronic Signature Directive 1999/93/EC [37].  The main goals of this action are to:   ensure mutual recognition and acceptance of electronic identification across borders   give legal effect and mutual recognition to trust services   enhance current rules on e-signatures   provide a legal framework for electronic seals, time stamping, electronic document  acceptability, electronic delivery and website authentication.   ensure minimal security level of trust services providers systems   enforce obligation of notifications about security incidents at trust services providers  In Article 15 of the above mentioned draft regulation the EC proposes that trust services providers  have to demonstrate due diligence, in relation to the identification of risks and adoption of  appropriate security practices, and notify competent bodies of any breach of security or loss of  integrity that has a significant impact on the trust service provided and on the personal data  maintained therein.  In this context, the European Union Agency for Network and Information Security (ENISA) developed  in 2013 the Guidelines for trust services providers, discussing the minimal security levels to be  maintained by the trust services providers. The study is split into three parts:  Security framework: describing the framework surrounding trust service providers (TPSs), focusing  on EU standards, but taking into account others where relevant.  Risk assessment: discussing the principles and concepts of managing the risks applicaple to TSPs by  defining and controlling threats and vulnerabilities.  Mitigating the impact of security incidents: recommending measures to mitigate the impact of  security incidents on trust service providers (TSP) by proposing suitable technical and organisational  means to handle the security risks posed to the TSP.  All three parts can also be used separately, as they address different issues and target different  audience, so the introductory sections overlap.  This document, Part 3: Mitigating security incidents, recommends measures to mitigate the impact  of security incidents on trust service providers (TSP) by proposing suitable technical and  organisational means to handle the security risks posed to the TSP. This is done using a certification  service provider (CSP) as representative example. The document focuses on the concepts and  entities of hierarchical public key infrastructures (PKI), leaving other concepts, such as web of trust,  out of scope.  Understanding which entities and processes are involved in trust services and which possible  impacts derive from security incidents is the first step of a proper risk management approach. The  2  https://www.eid-stork.eu/  https://www.eid-stork.eu/  Mitigating the impact of security incidents  Guidelines for trust services providers – Part 3  Version 1.0 – December 2013  Page  v  most important entities involved in trust services include: the certificate authority (CA), the  registration authority (RA), the subject, the relying party, and others such as the time stamping  authority (TSA) and the validation authority (VA). The major processes involved in trust services  include: registration,  certification, CA key management, subject key & certificate management,  revocation and other processes such as validation or time-stamping. The main impacts of a TSP  security incident include: Identity theft, eavesdropping, signature forgery, service unavailability, and  repudiation damage.  In order to understand the possible security related situations the TSP might face it is important to  develop an understanding of possible incident scenarios and attack vectors. The major incident  scenarios include: the compromise of major TSP building blocks such as the CA, the RA, the  revocation services, or the cryptographic modules, a repudiation claim, an impersonation, a personal  data breach, the compromise of a subject key, and the loss of service availability. The ENISA survey3  reveals that TSP providers see a CA compromise as the scenario with the biggest impact (8.7 of 10),  while the compromise of a subject’s key pair is seen as the scenario with the lowest impact (4.3 of  10) on the TSP. The same report also reveals that a compromise of the CA is deemed by the TSPs the  least probable scenario, while the compromise of a subject’s key pair is seen as the most probable  scenario. The major attack vectors include: logical attacks, cryptographic attacks, insider attacks, and  physical attacks. Following said surrey, most TSPs consider logical attacks the most likely (56% say  highly likely or likely) while physical attacks are considered the most unlikely (89% say unlikely or  very unlikely).  Preparing for possible incidents is one of the most important steps in impact mitigation as it allows  the TSP to be able to respond quickly and effectively in case of an incident. Amongst the most  important procedures and information gathering capabilities are: alert gathering capability, incident  response capability, having staff and systems incident ready, established means of communication  with stakeholders, and ready to go contingency plans.  In order to be able to actually react (in an appropriate way) to an incident, the TSP must be able to  detect and assess incidents. Amongst the most important indicators for a security incident are:  fraudulent certificate activities, abnormal activities in information systems, suspicious information in  the certificate lifecycle management logs, unaccounted key media, loss of availability, and loss of  custody of subject key.  Once an incident is detected, an effective and prompt response is critical for mitigating the impact of  a breach in a TSP. In order to select an appropriate response, breaches are classified into the  following two general types: breaches that compromise the integrity of the trust service and  breaches that don’t compromise the integrity of the trust service (availability is not taken into  account in this classification). Depending on the type of breach, the focus of handling the incident  differs. In the former case, the priority in response is always to limit the damage, even if this has as a  consequence the temporal unavailability of the service for legitimate users. In the latter case, the  priority in response depends on the type of incident: with personal data breaches, to protect the  confidentiality of the data; with loss of availability, to recover the service; with repudiation claim, to  ensure traceability and accountability of actions.  Once the source of the compromise has been determined and the appropriate response actions to  mitigate the impact of the incident have been taken, the TSP should take the appropriate measures  to minimize the possibility of the incident occurring again. The main measures the TSP should take  3  For the in-depth description of the study, please refer to the document “TSP services, standards and risk  analysis report”, ENISA 2013.

Learning from past incidents (own and at other TSPs) is crucial in IT security in general. Many TSP  have already been affected by an incident during the course of their operations. Lessons can already  be learned from a variety of real world incidents4.  4  Description and analysis can be found in Section 8.

2013  Page  1  1 Introduction  This document provides recommendations on means of mitigating the impact of security incidents  consisting of appropriate technical and organisational measures to manage the risks affecting the  security of trust service provides (TSP). We use certificate service providers (CSP) as a representative  case for all types of TSP. The document is geared to what is called hierarchical public key  infrastructures (PKI) and the respective concepts and entities. Other concepts, such as web of trust,  are out of scope of this document and are not considered.  The document starts with a high level introduction to TSPs, including involved entities, processes and  impact analysis of security incidents. After that, the document covers the topics of identifying,  preparing, detecting, responding, and eradicating incidents in more detail. The document closes with  lessons learned from past real world incidents.  The general rule of security being a constant process of iteration, learning, and improvement also  applies to the measures presented in this document.  The National Institute of Technology and Standards (NIST) is currently preparing a cybersecurity  framework for critical infrastructures [35]. This framework is to a major extent applicable to manage  cybersecurity-related risk to TSPs, and is recommended as complimentary reference to standards,  guidelines, and best practices in the field.  Mitigating the impact of security incidents  Guidelines for trust services providers – Part 3  Version 1.0 – December 2013  Page  2  2 Trust service provider entities, processes, and impact  2.1 Entities involved in trust services  Traditionally, the technology used by TSPs is public key encryption. Understanding the different  entities involved in the trust service processes is important to be able to determine the different  types of incidents that may take place in trust services. Each incident scenario affects an entity or  process in the trust service. Amongst the entities involved in trust services are:  2.1.1 Certificate Authority  Certificate Authorities (CAs) are the actual issuers of electronic certificates. TSPs providing electronic  certificates have one or several CAs managing the whole certificate lifecycle, with the exception of  the registration process which is done by the Registration Authority (see below). Root CAs  usually  generate and maintain their own key pair which they use to sign the certificates they issue (and  usually provide certificates for other CAs). CAs act as a trust anchor: when an entity presents its  certificate to a relying party (see below), it is the signature by a trusted CA in the certificate that  provides assurance to the relying party that the certificate is legitimate and valid.  2.1.2 Registration Authority  The Registration Authority (RA) is the entity that verifies the certificate requester’s identity to ensure  that the certificate is issued to the legitimate subject. One RA may be connected with several CAs  and one CA may be connected with several RAs. Once the identity is verified, the RA sends a  certificate request to the CA, which will then produce an electronic certificate and deliver it to the  subject. The RA can be part of the TSP or it may be an external entity with some type of contract or  agreement with the TSP. As an example could serve a small TSP requiring physical presence of the  subject for identification purposes. This TSP may delegate the registration activity to an existing  external authority, as deploying physical offices may not be feasible for the TSP itself.  2.1.3 Subject  The subject is the entity whose identity is bound to some other data contained in the certificate  issued by the TSP, e.g. the certificate binds this entity’s identity to its public key. Subjects can be  natural persons (e.g. electronic signature certificates) or legal entities (e.g. electronic seals or web  authentication certificates). Subjects (or representatives) request from TSPs certificates which they  use for many different purposes, such as electronic signatures, authentication or encryption.  Subjects are bound to a certificate by the signature of the CA, which vows for their identity.  2.1.4 Relying party  The relying party is an entity that relies on the services and tokens (e.g. certificates) issued by the  TSP. Relying parties can be persons, services, devices, or any other entity. Examples are email users,  signature validation platforms, online services, browsers, etc.  2.1.5 Other entities  There are more possible entities involved in trust services. Examples include additional TSP  authorities providing core services such as revocation services or validation services. Other examples  are entities providing additional services such as time stamping services, authentication services,  signature services, or long-term archiving. Although these and other entities are not in the focus of  the document, the recommendations apply to them analogously.  Mitigating the impact of security incidents  Guidelines for trust services providers – Part 3  Version 1.0 – December 2013  Page  3  2.2 Processes involved in trust services  Understanding the processes that take place in providing trust services is important to determine  which processes may be affected by an incident. Attackers will try to exploit vulnerabilities in any of  the processes, and successful attacks on the different processes will have different consequences.  Amongst the modules in a trust service are:  2.2.1 Registration process  The registration process comprises all procedures which are in place to register a subject with a TSP,  such as:   Subject applies at TSP   Subject presents a proof of identity and maybe its eligibility (this step may be missing)   TSP registers subject or refuses to do so  2.2.2 Certification process  The certification process comprises all procedures which are in place to provide a subject with a  certificate, such as:   Subject requests a certificate at the RA   RA sends a certificate request to the CA   CA issues certificate   Certificate and keys delivery to subject  2.2.3 CA key management process  The CA key management process comprises all procedures which are in place to manage the CA key  pair during its complete lifecycle, such as:   CA key pair generation   CA key pair storage   CA key pair backup   CA key pair recovery   CA public key dissemination (e.g. by self-signed certificate)   CA key pair decommissionning   CA key pair archiving   Subject key management process  This key certificate management process comprises all procedures which are in place to manage the  subject keys, such as:   Subject key pair generation   Subject key pair provisioning (e.g. by device provisioning)   Subject key pair storage   CA key pair backup   CA key pair recovery  Logically the revocation of subject key pair (subection 2.2.6) can be also considered as part of this  process.  Mitigating the impact of security incidents  Guidelines for trust services providers – Part 3  Version 1.0 – December 2013  Page  4  2.2.4 Subject certificate management process  The subject certificate management process comprises all procedures which are in place to manage  subject certificates, such as:   Subject certificate generation   Subject certificate delivery   Subject certificate renewal, rekey and update   Subject certificate dissemination   Subject certificate suspension  2.2.5 Revocation process  The revocation process comprises all procedures which are in place to revoke certificates, such as:   Certificate revocation request   Certificate revocation   Certificate revocation publishing (e.g. CRL, OCSP).  2.2.6 Other processes and services  There are more processes involved in trust services. Examples include:   Validation services (core to certificate management)   Time stamping services   Authentication services   Signature services   Long-term archiving  Although these and other processes are not in the focus of the document, the recommendations can  apply to them by analogy, taking into account they differences in nature.  2.3 Impact of security incidents  It is important to understand the consequences of a security incident to comprehend why it is critical  for TSPs to respond promptly and appropriately to incidents. Most operations in the Internet that  require a high assurance of proof of identity rely nowadays on the use of electronic certificates.  Amongst the main consequences of a compromise of a TSP are:  2.3.1 Assuming the identity of another entity  Entities present digital certificates to relying parties in order to link their identity with the  corresponding public key. Once verified, the relying party will accept the identity of the entity as  correct. This process can be applied for any authentication purposes, for example, an entity  accessing a system or a web page presenting itself to a user.  If a malicious entity manages to circumvent, break, or another unlawful operation on this process,  e.g. by forging certificates, it is able to assume the subject’s identity and act in its name.  2.3.2 Eavesdropping on private communications  On the Internet, sensitive communication between entities is often secured against eavesdropping  and spoofing, e.g. Web sites by means of TLS. In these processes, electronic certificates play a major  role in exchanging the respective keys. Once verified, the relying party will deem the communication  confidential.  Mitigating the impact of security incidents  Guidelines for trust services providers – Part 3  Version 1.0 – December 2013  Page  5  If a malicious entity managed to interfere with this, e.g. by mounting a man in the middle attack  using fake certificates, it would be able to eavesdrop on the communication.  2.3.3 Forging electronic signatures  Where the legal framework allows it (through appropriate legal acts, which is the case in most major  jurisdictions), electronic signatures can be used for the same purpose as handwritten signatures;  they can be used to make legal commitments, like signing a contract or submitting a tax declaration,  etc. Certificates play a major role in the verification of signatures, establishing authenticity and non- repudiation.  Being able to forge an electronic signature, e.g. by gaining unauthorized access to the signature key,  enables the attacker to sign arbitrary documents in the victim’s name.  2.3.4 Unavailability of services  A TSP provides services to other parties. These other parties rely on the TSP for services such as key  generation, certificate issuance, and revocation checking.  Being able to delay or even entirely stop the TSPs services, e.g. the OCSP server5, enables the  attacker to interfere with the day-to-day operations of the parties relying on them.  2.3.5 Reputation damage  The business of a TSP stands and falls with its reputation. As having a good reputation is a necessary  condition for being trusted and chosen by clients, having a bad reputation is sufficient to not being  trusted.  If an attacker manages to cause serious security incidents, not only the security is at stake but also  the TSPs reputation and thereby its entire business.  5  Online Certificate Status Protocol, described in RFC 6960 [25]  Mitigating the impact of security incidents  Guidelines for trust services providers – Part 3  Version 1.0 – December 2013  Page  6  3 Identifying incident scenarios and attack vectors  After identifying the entities, processes and possible impacts on TSPs, it is important to develop an  understanding of possible incident scenarios and attack vectors to understand the possible  situations the trust service provider (TSP) might face.  3.1 Incident scenarios  Incident scenarios define possible types of events that could affect an organization and cause  negative consequences. The importance of identifying incident scenarios is that it helps the  organization to make a classification of incidents when they occur, and to have a protocol for  response based on the characteristics and possible consequences of the incident.  ENISA identified a group of incident scenarios6 that classifies the identified type of events that could  affect a (TSP) and that can be used by TSPs as a reference. In the following paragraphs, a description  of the identified incident scenarios is provided. Although all descriptions given here focus on  technical issues, it is possible to provoke the same incidents by organizational means, such as social  engineering or coercion. In addition, most of the incidents can also be provoked by accident or  human error.  3.1.1 Compromise of a Certificate Authority  Relying parties use the electronic signature of the CA in certificates as an attestation of the  legitimacy of the certificate. If attackers control the CA private keys, they can generate fake  certificates which relying parties will accept as valid because they are signed by the CA. To achieve  this, the attacker would need either access to the CA private signing key, or access to the certificate  signing applications of the CA which activate the key (avoidable in case where principles of  segregation of duties and dual control are put in place).  3.1.2 Compromise of a Registration Authority  The role of the Registration Authority is to verify the subject identity and to subsequently send a  certificate issuance request to the Certificate Authority. Although the RA doesn’t generate the  certificates itself, compromises to its systems or keys could lead equally to fraudulent certificate  issuance. The main objective of an attacker compromising a RA is the generation of fraudulent  certificate requests that are accepted by the CA as legitimate. To compromise the RA, an attacker  may obtain access to the RA key and manage to send fraudulent requests to the CA, or succeed to  intrude its certificate request generation systems or intrude and tamper with the communication  channel between the RA and the CA.  3.1.3 Compromise of the revocation services  It is important that the information regarding the status of certificates is correct, complete and  available 24x7 so that e.g. no revoked certificates are accepted as valid. The goal of a revocation  service compromise may be to modify the revocation services so that revoked certificates appear as  valid, to erase a revocation request so that a compromised certificate is not revoked, to disrupt  legitimate user operations by invalidating revocation status information, or to fraudulently revoke  valid certificates.  6  Please refer to “Guidelines for trust service providers, part 2 – Risk assessment”  Mitigating the impact of security incidents  Guidelines for trust services providers – Part 3  Version 1.0 – December 2013  Page  7  3.1.4 Compromise of the cryptographic modules  A compromise of cryptographic modules occurs when the cryptographic algorithms, parameters,  protocols, or implementations (SW or HW) become insecure. If, for example, the algorithm used to  generate the CA or subject key pairs become insecure, an attacker could deduce or replicate the  private key. Another possibility is that the actual signature /encryption algorithm is weak, enabling  an attacker to generate fake signatures / decrypt messages without having access to the private key.  Note that bad parameters or implementations (SW or HW) can very well lead to weaknesses despite  the fact that the  algorithm or protocol being used is secure.  3.1.5 Repudiation claim by certificate subject  A repudiation claim occurs when a subject denies having performed the actions that are attributed  to him/her by the certificate usage. A repudiation claim may be legitimate when it is the  consequence of another type of breach, such as compromised subject keys, or may be fraudulent  when the subject simply wants to deny actions actually performed by him/her by questioning the  security of the provider.  3.1.6 Impersonation  An impersonation occurs when a malicious entity assumes the identity of another entity with the  objective to commit a malicious act. In our case, this means an attacker assumes the identity of a  subject e.g. in order to gain access rights to confidential information, or fraudulently act otherwise in  the name of the victim.  3.1.7 Personal data breach  A personal data breach occurs when personal data provided to or produced by the TSP are disclosed  to unauthorized entities. Personal data maintained by the TSP include information contained in the  certificates (which is available to everyone), the registration records and the audit logs, aside from  staff or business relation data. A personal data breach can imply legal and economic sanctions from  supervisory authorities, and can seriously damage the reputation of the TSP.  3.1.8 Compromise of a subject’s private key  Subjects use their private keys to sign documents, authenticate to systems or decrypt messages or  communications. Subject’s private keys should be under their sole custody, or, when foreseen by the  certificate policy, under the TSP custody, always following strong security procedures to protect the  confidentiality and integrity of the key. A compromise of a subject private key occurs when the  subject (or the TSP on its behalf) loses exclusive custody of its private key, effectively allowing an  attacker to supplant his/her identity or access confidential information.  3.1.9 Loss of availability of services  An incident affecting the availability of the CA or RA systems can have negative effects for the  reputation of the TSP. If there is temporary unavailability of requesting a new certificate or renewing  one this incident might not seriously affect the trust in the CA. But if the revocation management  systems are unavailable, this is a serious issue, as proper certificate usage is impeded.  Mitigating the impact of security incidents  Guidelines for trust services providers – Part 3  Version 1.0 – December 2013  Page  8  3.1.10 Impact and probability of incident scenarios  In June and July 2013 ENISA conducted a survey among trust services providers, in which 46  participants took part. The goal of this survey was to identify security practices in force at these  organisations7.  Among others, it asked respondents to rate the incident scenarios in terms of impact and probability  of occurrence for any TSP.  Figure 1 shows the results of the incident impact questionnaire. The estimated impact value  represents the median impact score assigned by the trust service providers participating in the  survey. Impact scores range from 10 (very high) to 0 (very low). We can see that the compromise of  the CA is rated as worst scenario with a very high impact (8.7 of 10). The lowest rate is assigned to  the compromise of a subject’s key pair having still a medium impact (4.3 of 10). The ratings of the  other scenarios are nearly linearly distributed between these two impact levels.  Figure 1: Estimated incident impact (based on survey results)  Figure 2 shows the results of the incident probability questionnaire. The estimated probability value  represents the median probability score assigned by the 41 trust service providers participating in  the survey. Probability scores range from 10 (very likely) to 0 (very unlikely). We can see that the  repudiation claim by certificate subject is rated as most likely scenario with a medium probability.  The least likely scenario is the compromise of the CA having a low probability. The second least likely  7  For the in-depth description of the study, please refer to the document “TSP services, standards and risk  analysis report”, ENISA 2013. The participants are mentioned in the acknowledgements at the beginning of  this document.  Mitigating the impact of security incidents  Guidelines for trust services providers – Part 3  Version 1.0 – December 2013  Page  9  scenario is the compromise of the revocation services already scratching medium probability. The  ratings of the other scenarios are nearly linearly distributed between the probability levels of the  most likely and second least likely scenario.  Figure 2: Estimated incident probability (based on survey results)  3.2 Attack vectors  An attack vector is a path or means by which an attack can be or is made8. Attack vectors help to  identify which are the possible points of entry an attacker may use when trying to penetrate a  system. Based on the characteristics of trust service providers, we use four attack vectors that can  be used to compromise a TSP operation. In the following paragraphs, a description of these attack  vectors is provided. Although all descriptions given here focus on technical issues, it is possible to  open the same attack vectors by organizational means, such as social engineering or coercion. In  addition, most of the attack vectors can also be opened by accident or human error.  3.2.1 Logical attacks  Logical attacks consist of attempts to infiltrate the CA or RA systems in order to manipulate them  with the goal of obtaining access to private keys, producing fraudulent certificates or tampering with  revocation information. Trust services rely to a high extent on cryptography, however the set of  information systems build upon the cryptographic modules are also an important component of the  trust service.  CA and RA information systems may be subject to attacks that can result in fraudulent certificate  issuance without actual access to any private key. For example, intrusion in a RA system can lead to  fraudulent certificate request. Note that it is also possible to attack the subject’s system to gain  access to fraudulent certificates or provoke or prevent revocations.  To protect themselves from logical attacks, TSPs should implement perimeter security measures and  all kind of security tools on their networks. The TSP should also apply secure personal security  8  http://web.mit.edu/mitei/research/studies/documents/electric-grid-2011/Electric_Grid_Full_Report.pdf,  Glossary  http://web.mit.edu/mitei/research/studies/documents/electric-grid-2011/Electric_Grid_Full_Report.pdf  Mitigating the impact of security incidents  Guidelines for trust services providers – Part 3  Version 1.0 – December 2013  Page  10  environments (PSE), such as smart cards, as end user devices and promote the usage of secure  connectivity equipment, such as certified card readers with PIN pad and display, and stress the  importance of secured and up-to-date end user equipment, such as antivirus software and correct  patch level.  3.2.2 Cryptographic attacks  Cryptographic attacks have an important impact on trust services, as the core technological  component sustaining trust services is public key cryptography. The security of public key  infrastructures depends, amongst others, heavily on the strength of the cryptographic algorithms,  parameters, protocols, and implementations (SW or HW) they use. Cryptographers study  permanently the existing cryptographic modules to determine whether they are vulnerable to the  different existing types of attacks.  Attackers will try to compromise the security of cryptographic modules using vulnerabilities in order  to compromise the security of the system.  To protect themselves from cryptographic attacks, TSPs should update their cryptographic  parameters (e.g. key length), implementations (e.g. crypto libraries or HSMs), protocols (e.g. key  exchange), and even algorithms (e.g. hash algorithm) whenever indicated.  3.2.3 Insider attacks  Trust services are operated by people, and the security of the process relies to a certain extent on  them.  Insider attacks are those conducted by the TSP personnel. This type of attack is usually hard to  detect.  TSPs should implement measures such as logging and auditing and double control for the critical  operations to avoid relying on any single person.  3.2.4 Physical attacks  Trust services are conducted at some physical location, where the actual hardware, software and  key material are installed.  TSPs may be subject to attacks that try to compromise their physical security in order to gain access  to applications or key material or to interfere with TSP processes.  TSPs should implement strict physical security controls, especially in all areas where keys are stored  or activated, making this type of attack difficult to implement. Additionally, private TSP keys should  be stored in tamper resistant hardware media (originals and possible backups) and shouldn’t be  extracted from this media at any point, except for redundancy, backup, or recovery purposes.  3.2.5 Probability of occurrence of attack vectors  The ENISA survey on security practices of trust service providers asked respondents to rate the  identified attack vectors in terms of probability of materialization for any TSP. The values were  assigned by the 41 TSPs participating in the survey, from 1 (very unlikely) to 4 (highly likely).  The results, depicted in Figure 3, show that logical attacks are considered the most probable by most  respondents (56% say highly likely or likely), followed by insider attacks (55% say likely or unlikely)  and cryptographic attacks (55% say unlikely or very unlikely). Physical attacks are considered by the  respondents the less likely to occur (89% say unlikely or very unlikely).  Mitigating the impact of security incidents  Guidelines for trust services providers – Part 3  Version 1.0 – December 2013  Page  11  Figure 3: Attack vector occurrence probability (based on survey results)  Mitigating the impact of security incidents  Guidelines for trust services providers – Part 3  Version 1.0 – December 2013  Page  12  4 Preparing for incidents  One of the most important phases for responding to an incident in any kind of ICT service is to  prepare beforehand all the procedures and necessary information to be able to respond quickly and  effectively if an incident takes place. Appropriate policy is an instrument to prepare and to provide  notice to service users and supervisory authorities. This section provides recommendations on what  kind of aspects a TSP should prepare.  4.1 Enable means to gather alerts  4.1.1 Enable outside parties to report incidents  Incidents in TSPs may in many cases be detected by certificate holders, relying parties or any other  outside party. They should be able to easily report suspicious activity associated to certificates  issued by the TSP. The TSP should establish a support line or helpdesk where any information  regarding suspicious activity can be received.  4.1.2 Enable systems for staff to report abnormal events  Not all incidents will arrive from outside the TSP, for example suspicious log activity will be detected  by the TSP personnel. The TSP should provide means for them to register any incidence in a  standardized format so that incident management personnel can response more effectively.  4.1.3 Follow alert systems from external sources  Suspicions of compromises of trust services or cryptographic algorithms, parameters, protocols, and  implementations (SW or HW)  may be published, e.g. in Internet, even before the TSP is aware. The  TSP should follow security alert systems and forums and be aware of the latest threats.  4.1.4 Activate alerts in internal systems  The TSP should establish an adequate level of logging in all information systems, revise logs  periodically, and enable systems that alert personnel when suspicious activities appear in systems  logs.  4.1.5 Conduct continuous self monitoring and self testing  The TSP should foster a culture of self monitoring and self testing. This includes actively trying to  break the own systems by all available means such as penetration and vulnerability testing.  Whenever indicated, an alarm should be raised through the established channels.  4.2 Create an incident response capability  4.2.1 Create an incident response team  TSPs should have an incident response team. Different configurations and capabilities of an incident  response team exist, the TSP should define it according to its characteristics and their risk  assessment. Amongst the questions to answer are:   Whether a 24x7 incident response capability is needed (which seems appropriate for at  revocation services at least)   The size of the team, whether they will part-time or full time, and the needed skills of the  personnel.   Whether central incident management response or distributed incident response is applied.  Mitigating the impact of security incidents  Guidelines for trust services providers – Part 3  Version 1.0 – December 2013  Page  13  4.2.2 Create incident response procedures  After determining different incident types that may occur, the TSP should define procedures for  incident management. Having ready procedures will improve and speed up response when dealing  with an incident. This should also include realistic response drills.  4.3 Prepare staff and systems for an incident  4.3.1 Assign roles and responsibilities  Have an updated list of roles and responsibilities of staff in case of an incident. This applies not just  to those directly involved in managing the incident, but for all personnel operating CA functions. All  personnel should have clear instructions on how to proceed in case of an incident affecting their  functions.  4.3.2 Train personnel  Conduct incident response exercises periodically in order for the involved staff to be able to handle  incidents properly.  4.3.3 Put redundancy or fail-safe mechanisms in place  Have (cold or hot) standby systems in place to take over the duties of the main system in case of an  incident. Consider applying fail-safe cryptographic modules, mechanisms such as forward secure  signatures and / or utilizing fundamentally different crypto modules in parallel.  4.4 Have means of communication with all stakeholders  4.4.1 Create a repository of certificate holders contact information  The TSP should establish, if appropriate according to local legislation and field of use, a database of  issued certificates with the contact information of all the certificate holders and keep it updated.  This will speed up the process of contacting them in case an incident takes place with their  certificate.  4.4.2 Create a repository of relying parties  The TSP should establish a database with contact information regarding (known) relying parties (or  their representatives) that use their certificates, such as government sites or trust stores for web  browsers, in order to facilitate the process of contacting them if an incident takes place.  4.5 Create a repository of supervisors and competent authorities  The TSP should establish a database with contact information regarding supervisors and competent  authorities. Qualified EU providers (and all providers operating in Europe when the new Proposal for  a Regulation comes into force) have to inform supervisory authorities of any security incident  affecting the service without undue delay. Additionally, the TSP needs to inform data protection  authorities and under certain conditions data subjects when personal data are breached. It is also  recommendable to have contacts with competent CERTs. Knowing the appropriate channels for  communication will facilitate the process if an incident occurs.  Mitigating the impact of security incidents  Guidelines for trust services providers – Part 3  Version 1.0 – December 2013  Page  14  4.6 Have contingency plans  The typical approach is to have backup sites (hot and/or cold) as well as business continuity plans,  but also the following.  4.6.1 Have agreements with other TSPs to obtain substitute certificates  In the very critical situation where certificates need to be replaced, and none of the TSP’s CAs, RAs  or revocation services can be trusted or are unavailable, the TSP should be able to provide subjects  with services from other providers until the operations can be resumed with their own systems. This  will minimize the impact on subjects.  4.6.2 Maintain updated information of your environment  The TSP should have documented information regarding all data that can be helpful in case of an  incident, such as:   Lists of assets   Network diagrams   Applications and software versions   Disaster procedures   Recover and restore procedures   Contingency plans  4.6.3 Have a service termination plan  In case the TSP decides for any reason or is forced to discontinue operations, there should be a plan  in place to ensure that the services go down smoothly. E.g. make sure that issued certificates can be  still verified or revoked from external sources. In some countries the succession of service in case of  termination is obligatory for accredited CAs.  Mitigating the impact of security incidents  Guidelines for trust services providers – Part 3  Version 1.0 – December 2013  Page  15  5 Detecting and assessing the incident  Detection of an incident in a TSP may be triggered by different events. Reports may arrive to the TSP  through the helpdesk or support contact addresses, be detected by staff in the internal systems or  even by media and public sources.  Although not all unusual events will correspond to an actual incident, they are indicators and should  be investigated by the TSP. During the detection phase, the TSP first line respondent should  determine whether an incident is actually taking place. Training of personnel is important to help  them to detect abnormal behaviour. Also, there should be a review process to assure that no  incident slipped through due to wrong assessment.  If the TSP first line respondent assesses an incident may be occurring, the next phase is the incident  analysis. From the moment an event is classified as an incident, all evidence should be preserved in  case it will be needed at a further stage.  The goal of the analysis phase is to determine the type of incident and execute the appropriate  response plan. Events that indicate an incident, especially those concerning the detection of  fraudulent certificate activities, are linked to different types of TSP incidents.  The TSP personnel should assess the circumstances of the breach, the information systems affected  and all other relevant information to determine the type of breach. Correlation of events, training of  personnel and existing procedures play an important role is this phase.  The following paragraphs provide some guidelines regarding different abnormal events that may  take place in a TSP and how to assess them in order to identify the appropriate type of incident that  is taking place.  5.1 Fraudulent certificate activities  An indicator that some kind of certificate compromise might be taking place is reported; for  example:   Certificates associated with man in the middle attacks   Certificates associated to known malware sites   Malware signed with certificates   Subjects reporting that certificates associated with their name/organization do not belong to  them   Subjects that report usage of their certificates that they didn’t do themselves.   Attempts to use invalid or revoked certificates  Fraudulent certificate activity may indicate different types of compromises. In order to determine  what part of the trust service is compromised, at least the following steps should be followed:   Analyse the potential fraudulent activity to determine the certificates’ origin and verify that  they are linked to a CA of the TSP.   Contact the certificate subjects’ to assess whether fraudulent activities are taking place.   Assess the circumstances under which the certificate was issued:  o Contact the RA to check registration logs and records.  o Check certificate request and generation logs at CA.  If any of the above investigations leads to a suspicion that there is a bogus certificate, the TSP should  proceed to analyse suspicious activities in the certificate lifecycle management and abnormal logs in  the information systems and finally come to a decision whether there is a breach or not and react  accordingly.  Mitigating the impact of security incidents  Guidelines for trust services providers – Part 3  Version 1.0 – December 2013  Page  16  5.2 Abnormal activities in information systems  Another incident indicator is any event in the TSP’s systems that could indicate an intrusion attempt,  for example:   Unsuccessful login requests   Unusual network traffic flows   Unusual event detection in antivirus, IPS, perimeter systems etc.   Appearance of filenames not known to the administrators   Changes in audit functions in information systems  Abnormal log entries in information systems may come as a triggering event themselves, or they  may be detected upon revision of systems when other suspicious activities are taking place. The TSP  should analyse whether the logs point to an intrusion being successful. If that is case, the TSP should  check for suspicious activities in the certificate lifecycle management to determine whether the  intruder actually managed to create fraudulent certificates. Be aware that an intruder, once in the  system, may be able to cover its tracks.  5.3 Suspicious information in the certificate lifecycle management logs  Suspicious information in the certificate lifecycle management logs may come as a triggering event  itself, when personnel operating CA or RA functions detect strange certificate requests, issuances or  revocations; or it may be detected upon checking of systems when other suspicious activities are  taking place; or during standard auditing activities.  In any case, the TSP should inspect the system and check for any indication a fake certificate or  revocation was requested or generated. Amongst the indicator are:   Inconsistencies in the registration, certificate generation or revocation logs   Inconsistencies in the information associated to any certificate   Registration requests lacking associated registration records   Certificate generation or revocation lacking any request   Unusual behaviour (e.g. physical registration outside business hours)   Inconsistencies in revocation service logs (e.g. OCSP queries for not issued certificates)  If there is an indication of an incident, the TSP should assess the type of incident taking place by  checking the different logs and correlating information from the different systems involved in the  certification process. For example:   Certificate requests logs with no associated registration records can be indicators of an RA  compromise.   Logs in the CA certificate generation systems that are not associated to any matching  certificate requests from an RA could be an indication of a CA compromise.   Suspicious certificates that have no associated certificate generation logs in the CA systems  can indicate a CA compromise or a compromise of the cryptographic modules.   Registration records that seem inconsistent may indicate an impersonation incident.   Frequent revocation status requests (e.g. OCSP) for certificates that have no corresponding  certificate issued may indicate a CA compromise incident.  Mitigating the impact of security incidents  Guidelines for trust services providers – Part 3  Version 1.0 – December 2013  Page  17  5.4 Unaccounted key media  The TSP should maintain an inventory of all physical media storing key material and periodically  verify that all media is accounted for. Any key media handling or storage device unaccounted for  should be considered an indication of a compromise:   CA key storage devices   CA operators’ keys   RA key storage devices   RA operators’ keys   Subjects’ keys   Key backup media  The TSP should assess the circumstances under which the key handling material was lost to  determine whether it was due to accidental or intentional events, and whether fraudulent certificate  or revocation issuance could have occurred. In any case the suitable measures should be taken to  deal with the unaccounted media.  5.5 Loss of availability  Loss of availability of the TSP systems can be the consequence of an intrusion attempt or be due to  accidental events. In any case it should be treated as an incident and its source should be  investigated. In the event of a loss of availability, the TSP should immediately restore the availability  of critical systems, such as revocation services, e.g. by switching to standby systems. The TSP should  also assess whether there any accidental causes that could explain a disruption, such as loss of  essential services, natural hazards, etc. but also investigate other potential causes.  If no external event seems to be the cause of the disruption, the TSP should determine the origin of  the system malfunction by checking information systems logs. When the source of the system  malfunction is established, the next step is to check whether it was the consequence of any  intentional action.  5.6 Loss of custody of subject key  Reports by a subject of loss of sole custody of its private key can point to an accidental loss or to an  attempt of compromising a subject key. The TSP should assist the subject in determining whether  any fraudulent activity is taking place.  Mitigating the impact of security incidents  Guidelines for trust services providers – Part 3  Version 1.0 – December 2013  Page  18  6 Responding to the incident  An effective and prompt response is critical for mitigating the impact of a breach in a TSP.  6.1 Types of breaches  Incidents at TSPs can be divided into two general types, and this classification plays an important  role in selecting the appropriate response. The two mentioned types are:  6.1.1 Breaches that compromise the integrity of the trust service  These incidents, or compromises, imply access to private keys, ability to infiltrate systems that  activate these keys or any kind of illegitimate access to any process involved in the certificate  generation. Such incidents can have as a consequence the fraudulent generation, use, or revocation  of certificates, and therefore require immediate revocation of all fake certificates generated or  appropriate handling of fake revocations. In some cases, even the revocation of all certificates issued  by a certain CA, including the root certificate may be indicated. Among these incidents are:   Compromise of a Certificate Authority   Compromise of a Registration Authority   Compromise of the revocation services   Compromise of the cryptographic modules   Impersonation of a valid subject   Loss of availability of revocation services  In incidents that compromise the integrity of the trust service, the priority in response is always to  limit the damage, even if this has as a consequence the temporal unavailability of the service for  legitimate users.  6.1.2 Breaches that don’t compromise the integrity of the trust service  These types of incidents do not require revocation of certificates; therefore the response protocol is  different. In any case, they may have very negative consequences for the TSP. Among these  incidents are:   Personal data breach   Loss of availability of the trust services other than revocation   Repudiation claim   Unability to validate the certificate  With incidents that do not compromise the integrity of the trust service, the priority in response  depends on the type of incident: with personal data breaches, to protect the confidentiality of the  data; with loss of availability, to recover the service; with repudiation claim, to ensure traceability  and accountability of actions.  6.2 Response guidance  The following sections provide guidance on how to respond to different incident scenarios in TSPs.  6.2.1 Responding to a CA compromise  When a CA compromise is detected, it is critical for the TSP to take prompt and appropriate  measures to mitigate the impact of the breach. The goal is to prevent any further usage of  fraudulent certificates. At least, the following actions should be undertaken:  Mitigating the impact of security incidents  Guidelines for trust services providers – Part 3  Version 1.0 – December 2013  Page  19   Discontinue any new certificate issuance from the affected CA.   Revoke the CA certificate (which automatically revokes all certificates issued by the CA.   Update the revocation status information.   Notify relying parties and urge them to update all revocation information.   Inform affected subjects of the revocation of their certificates.   Notify competent authorities about the breach.   Provide affected subjects with substitute certificates from another CA, e.g. from a standby  system or another TSP.  If the affected CA is a root CA, follow at least these additional steps:   Revoke trust in the root CA in all trust repositories where it is included.   Provide affected subjects with substitute certificates from another CA, e.g. from a standby  system or another TSP.  6.2.2 Responding to a RA compromise  Both RA compromises and CA compromises can lead to fraudulent certificates being issued. The  response will depend on whether it can be determined which certificate requests sent by the RA  were illegitimate.  If all fraudulent certificates can be detected, revoking those certificates can be sufficient. But when  not all fraudulent certificates can be detected with certainty, it is recommended for the CA to revoke  all certificates issued by the RA, because there is no guarantee as to whether fake certificates are  being used. At least, the following actions are recommended:  If all fraudulent certificates can be identified:   Discontinue any new certificate issuance requests from the affected RA.   Revoke the RA certificate.   Revoke all fraudulent certificates.   Update the revocation status information.   Notify relying parties and urge them to update all revocation information.   Notify competent authorities about the breach.  If not all fraudulent certificates can be identified, follow at least these additionally steps:     Revoke all certificates requested from the affected RA.   Identify affected legitimate subjects and provide them with certificates from another RA,  e.g. from a standby system or another TSP.  6.2.3 Responding to a compromise of the revocation services  The goal of responding to a compromise of the revocation services is to avoid the usage of revoked  certificates and to re-establish the correctness of the revocation status information. Until revocation  information can be trusted, relying parties should not accept certificates. With this objective, at least  the following actions are recommended:   Notify relying parties and urge them not to accept any certificates from the CA until  revocation information can be trusted.   If the revocation status site seems to be compromised, set up a stand-in site for revocation  information checking, e.g. activate the standby system.   Identify the last trustable revocation status information.  Mitigating the impact of security incidents  Guidelines for trust services providers – Part 3  Version 1.0 – December 2013  Page  20   Add the legitimate revocations occurred since then to this revocation status information.   Disseminate this revocation status information.   Notify competent authorities about the breach.  6.2.4 Responding to a compromise of the cryptographic modules  Compromise of the cryptographic modules is a different event from other compromises in TSPs, as  the detection may come from external sources rather than an attack to the TSP itself. However, the  TSP should take action like in any other compromise by revoking the corresponding certificates. At  least, the following actions are recommended:   Discontinue any new certificate issuance using the compromised cryptographic modules.   Revoke all certificates issued with the compromised cryptographic modules.   Update the revocation status information.   Notify relying parties and urge them to update all revocation information.   Inform affected certificate subjects of the revocation of their certificates.   Notify competent authorities about the breach.   Provide affected certificate subjects with certificates with stronger cryptographic modules.  Note that here are proactive measures which prevent TSPs from being compromised even if (a  single) cryptographic module becomes insecure, e.g. forward secure cryptography and / or utilizing  fundamentally different crypto modules in parallel. In this case, the immediate revocation is not  necessary.  6.2.5 Responding to a repudiation claim by a certificate subject  Although a repudiation claim doesn’t imply necessarily a compromise of a certificate, it is advised in  this event to revoke the certificate, to ensure no further actions are performed with the certificate.  At least, the following actions are recommended:   Revoke the certificate to prevent any further usage.   Update the revocation status information.   Assess whether a compromise has taken place.   Gather all logs related to registration, certificate issuance and certificate usage (e.g. for  evidence purposes).  6.2.6 Responding to impersonation  An impersonation attack implies revocation of the affected certificates. Although this attack is of a  smaller scale than other compromises, in many cases it is a directed attack and can have very  damaging consequences; therefore a prompt response is needed. At least, the following actions are  recommended:   Revoke the attacked certificate(s).   Update the revocation status information.   Notify relying parties and urge them to update revocation information.   If the impersonated subject is not yet aware, inform the subject.   Notify competent authorities about the breach.  6.2.7 Responding to a personal data breach  The objective in the response to a personal data breach is to minimize the disclosure of personal  information. However, depending on the nature of the breach, this will not always be possible for  the TSP. At least, the following actions are recommended:  Mitigating the impact of security incidents  Guidelines for trust services providers – Part 3  Version 1.0 – December 2013  Page  21   Determine if the incident is on-going and take contention measures. For example, in the  case of a hacked system, disable the system until the vulnerabilities facilitating the incident  have been found and corrective actions taken.   Notify competent authorities about the breach.   Inform affected entities regarding which personal information has been compromised and  what is the extent of the disclosure.  6.2.8 Responding to a compromise of a subject’s key pair  A compromise in a subject key pair implies as an immediate action the revocation of the affected  certificate. If the compromise may affect other subjects, for example when it derives from  vulnerabilities in the subject device, further actions may be needed. At least, the following actions  are recommended:   Revoke the affected certificate(s).   Update the revocation status service.   If the certificate subject is not yet aware, inform the subject.   Notify competent authorities about the breach.   Issue new certificate for the subject(s).  In case the compromise affects other subjects, for example when it derives from vulnerabilities in  the subject key pair algorithm, At least the following additional actions are recommended:   Determine the common cause.   Determine all affected subjects  6.2.9 Responding to a loss of availability of services  The goal in the response to a loss of availability is to minimize the downtime of the service and the  impact on the trust service.   Activate contingency plans and business continuity plans (such as standby systems).   If the disruption affects revocation status information systems, notify relying parties and  urge them not to accept any certificates until revocation information is available to prevent  the use of revoked certificates.  Mitigating the impact of security incidents  Guidelines for trust services providers – Part 3  Version 1.0 – December 2013  Page  22  7 Eradicating and resolving the incident  Once the source of the compromise has been determined and the appropriate response actions to  mitigate the impact of the incident have been taken, the TSP should take the appropriate measures  to minimize the possibility of the incident occurring again. The measures the TSP should take  include:  7.1 Determine what facilitated the incident  Assess whether the incident was the consequence of vulnerabilities in any of the systems or  processes of the TSP. Most incidents can be traced to some vulnerability. If the incident was due to a  malicious insider, an associated vulnerability can be the lack of dual controls or mandatory rotation.  In the case of a cryptographic attack, it might possible that the chosen algorithms, protocols,  parameters or implementations (SW or HW) do not match the level of assurance needed for the  provider. In any case, it is of critical importance to trace what facilitated the incident in order to be  able to eradicate it.  7.2 Analyse the existing security policies and procedures  Review the existing policies and procedures (including policy enforcement), especially those related  to systems and processes related to the incident, to determine if they are sufficient for the expected  level of security. Especially important is to assess those policies and procedures related to the exiting  vulnerabilities.  7.3 Re-conduct a risk assessment  Re-conduct a risk assessment to determine if the existing security controls match the level of risk  accepted by the organization. Based on the analysis results determine if security measures are to be  incremented. Note that this should take place regularly anyway, even if no incident occurred.  7.4 Define and implement corrective measures  If the risk assessment results determine that any security levels need to be incremented, the last  step in the eradication process is to define and implement the security measures needed.  A parallel activity important during the eradication phase is to document all the actions taken during  the incident. All this information should be used as input to improve the incident management  procedures.  Mitigating the impact of security incidents  Guidelines for trust services providers – Part 3  Version 1.0 – December 2013  Page  23  8 Learning from past incidents  Many trust service providers (TSP) have already been affected by an incident during the course of  their operations. Prevention is critical for incidents not to take place, but as the following examples  show, once the incident has occurred, the response can certainly make a difference on the impact  for the users and the provider.  8.1 CA compromises  A while after the CA compromises presented here, updates of the OCSP standard (RFC 2560 [24] to  RFC 6960 [25]) and the CA/B Forum Guidelines9 (version 1.0.3 to version 1.0.4) have been issued, to  address OCSP responses for non-issued certificates.  DigiNotar  One of the most widely known examples of breach in a TSP which illustrates a CA compromise is the  DigiNotar case10. DigiNotar was a Dutch TSP operating from 1997 until 2011. DigiNotar provided two  types of certificates. Certificates from their own root CA: \"DigiNotar Root CA”, and certificates as an  intermediary of the Dutch Government root CA: \"Staat der Nederlanden\".  In July 2011, a fraudulent SSL certificate for Google domains was generated by an attacker who  gained access to DigiNotar’s internal systems. In the following weeks, at least 531 fake certificates  were issued for popular Internet domains.  DigiNotar failed to react to the breach in due time, making it possible for the attacker to launch man- in-the-middle attacks and eavesdrop on private communications. DigiNotar became aware of an  intrusion on July 19th 2011; however they didn’t publically admit the breach until end of August  2011. Common Internet browsers started to remove DigiNotar from their trusted certificates list as  they became aware of the possible fraudulent use.  An investigation was launched by the Dutch government on the incident. Although it was not clear  whether the other CA, the one issuing certificates for the Dutch government systems, had been  compromised, they decided to revoke all certificates on September 3rd 2011, making it impossible  for many Dutch citizens (those who had obtained their certificates through DigiNotar) to access  eGovernment platforms.  All these events and the failure to response diligently to the incident lead to DigiNotar going into  bankruptcy. Furthermore, it is difficult to estimate how many entities were subject to an intrusion in  their private communications by the use of fraudulent certificates.  The elapsed time frame between the detection and the public admission of the breach was more  than one month, effectively giving the attacker an extended amount of time to perform fraudulent  operations. The lack of a prompt response and the inability to clearly establish the impact of the  incident lead to a loss of trust in DigiNotar that eventually caused the end of the company.  Globalsign  On similar dates to the compromise of DigiNotar, the same hacker who intruded DigiNotar claimed  to have intruded Globalsign11. Globalsign conducted a throughout investigation by an external party  9  https://www.cabforum.org/  10  http://threatpost.com/final-report-diginotar-hack-shows-total-compromise-ca-servers-103112  11  http://www.theregister.co.uk/2011/09/07/globalsign_suspends_ssl_cert_biz/  https://www.cabforum.org/ http://threatpost.com/final-report-diginotar-hack-shows-total-compromise-ca-servers-103112 http://www.theregister.co.uk/2011/09/07/globalsign_suspends_ssl_cert_biz/  Mitigating the impact of security incidents  Guidelines for trust services providers – Part 3  Version 1.0 – December 2013  Page  24  that concluded that only a peripheral web server was breached, but the intrusion never reached any  CA operation systems and no fraudulent certificate issuance activity had taken place.  Turktrust  One of the last publically known incidents affecting a CA is the Turktrust case12. Turktrust is a large  Turkish TSP. In 2011 Turktrust erroneously issued certificates meant to be subject certificates, but  that were actually intermediate CA certificates with the capability of issuing new certificates whose  validity would be attested by Turktrust. This case shows an example of a compromise of an  intermediate CA due to an erroneous issuing of CA capabilities instead of an end user certificate.  One of the receivers of the erroneous certificates reported it to Turktrust and the certificate was  revoked. However, the receiver of the other certificate, the public transport authority in Ankara, did  not report the incident.. Google discovered in December 2012 that Chrome users are presented  Google certificates which were not issued by order of Google. The investigation lead by Turktrust  determined that the second certificate was installed in a proxy server which automatically generated  certificates for visited sites to conduct security scans of the traffic. Aside from that no misuse of the  certificate had taken place.  8.2 RA compromises  Comodo  Another example illustrates a Registration Authority compromise, such as the Comodo case13. On  March 15th 2011 an affiliate Registration Authority of Comodo, a large TLS certificates provider, was  compromised and nine rogue certificates were created for common Internet domains. The attack  targeted a user account in the RA, which had the capability to issue requests for new certificates. In  this case, the compromise was not of the CA, but of the RA, which has the responsibility to validate  the identity of subjects requesting certificates.  Comodo became aware of the intrusion on March 26th 2011 and immediately revoked all fraudulent  certificates and informed all relevant stakeholders. Activity was detected in Internet for only one of  the rogue certificates.  The Comodo case shows an example of how compromising Registration Authorities can lead to  fraudulent certificates. Comodo acted promptly and was able to determine the extent of the  incident, revoking the fraudulent certificates.  8.3 Impersonation  VeriSign  Another case illustrates the example of an impersonation incident, the VeriSign case14. The VeriSign  case is one of the first publicly known compromises to have occurred in a TSP. The breach was due  to an attacker claiming to be an employee of Microsoft to whom VeriSign issued two code signing  certificates. The fraudulent certificates could be used to sign malicious code to make it appear as  signed by Microsoft, which would avoid raising any security alerts in the browser.  12  http://nakedsecurity.sophos.com/2013/01/08/the-turktrust-ssl-certificate-fiasco-what-happened-and-what- happens-next/  13  http://blogs.comodo.com/it-security/data-security/the-recent-ra-compromise/  14  http://news.cnet.com/2100-1001-254586.html  http://nakedsecurity.sophos.com/2013/01/08/the-turktrust-ssl-certificate-fiasco-what-happened-and-what-happens-next/ http://nakedsecurity.sophos.com/2013/01/08/the-turktrust-ssl-certificate-fiasco-what-happened-and-what-happens-next/ http://blogs.comodo.com/it-security/data-security/the-recent-ra-compromise/ http://news.cnet.com/2100-1001-254586.html  Mitigating the impact of security incidents  Guidelines for trust services providers – Part 3  Version 1.0 – December 2013  Page  25  The certificates were issued on January 29th and 30th January 2001, and Microsoft was informed in  March of the same year. VeriSign claimed they detected the possible fraudulent issuance on a  routine audit.  VeriSign revoked the certificates, and included them in VeriSign's current CRL. However, because  VeriSign's code-signing certificates didn’t specify a link to the CRL location, browsers could not verify  this information. Therefore Microsoft had to issue a security update in order for the browser to be  able to check the revocation status of these certificates locally.  The fraudulent certificates were not detected to have been used in the Internet. VeriSign acted  promptly revoking the certificates before they were used.  8.4 Cryptographic compromises  RSA-512  In November 2011, Fox-IT reported on several abused subject certificates15. The certificates in  question were legitimately issued 512bit RSA certificates. In addition to their legitimate usage (e.g.  for HTTPS servers), the corresponding private keys had been used to sign malware.  Presumably, attackers had successfully derived the private key from the public key contained in the  certificates, which is known to take for 512bit keys at most a couple of weeks with modern  equipment. As most of the certificates did not include any usage restrictions, it was possible to use  e.g. certificates meant for authentication for signature purposes.  At least one of the CAs (Digicert Sdn. Bhd.) did not include a link for revocation checking into its  subject certificates, which led to the revocation of the respective CA certificate to contain the  damage.  8.5 Organizational failures  RSA-1024  In summer 2013, an international research team made their success in factoring 184 real world RSA- 1024 keys public16. These keys were generated by smart cards issued by the Taiwanese government  that were certified secure by multiple important standards: FIPS certification from NIST (U.S.  government) and CSE (Canadian government), and Common Criteria certification from BSI (German  government).  The cards were erroneously delivered in non-certified mode leading to the usage of a weak random  number generator. This lead to keys sharing primes that could relatively easy be computed by bulk  greatest common divider (GCD) extractions. By further investigating the randomness-generation  failures, more keys, that did not share primes, were factored.  8.6 Lessons learned  Summarizing the paragraphs above, the main lessons learned are:   Many types of TSP compromises have already happened; partly with serious  consequences. More incidents are to be expected.  15  https://www.fox-it.com/en/blog/rsa-512-certificates-abused-in-the-wild/  16  http://smartfacts.cr.yp.to/smartfacts-20130916.pdf  https://www.fox-it.com/en/blog/rsa-512-certificates-abused-in-the-wild/ http://smartfacts.cr.yp.to/smartfacts-20130916.pdf  Mitigating the impact of security incidents  Guidelines for trust services providers – Part 3  Version 1.0 – December 2013  Page  26   Serious compromises may happen without being attacked, just by an unfortunate series  of events / human errors.   Failure of responding diligently damages both the client and the provider.   Awareness and quick and proper reaction to an incident limits the damage to both the  client and the provider.   Having proper processes, policies (including but not limited to validity periods and  updates of cryptographic modules) and their enforcement and traceability are equally  important as the technical security measures.   Strong authentication of operators is of the essence, not only for CAs but also for RAs  and other TSP authorities.   Apart from algorithms and formats, the right choice of cryptographic parameters (e.g.  key length) and additional attributes (e.g. validity period, key usage, revocation  information, …) in certificates are of the essence.   Security certifications of individual modules, even those following internationally  renowned standards, do not guarantee the security or flawlessness of the services  composed using such modules.  Mitigating the impact of security incidents  Guidelines for trust services providers – Part 3  Version 1.0 – December 2013  Page  27  9 Recommendations  This section provides the most important recommendations contained in this document in short and  general form. These recommendations target the Trust Service Providers and cover the following  areas:   Remember that security is an ongoing process that never stops   Be aware of possible incidents and attack vectors   Prepare for known and unknown incidents  o The TSP should establish, if appropriate according to local legislation and field of  use, a database of issued certificates with the contact information  o The TSP should establish a database with contact information regarding (known)  relying parties (or their representatives) that use their certificates  o The TSP should establish a database with contact information regarding supervisors  and competent authorities  o The TSP should foster a culture of self monitoring and self testing  o The TSP should define procedures for incident management  o The TSP should have an updated list of roles and responsibilities of staff in case of an  incident  o The TSP should conduct incident response exercises periodically   Have means to actually detect and assess incidents  o The TSP should establish a support line or helpdesk where any information regarding  suspicious activity can be received  o The TSP should follow security alert systems and forums and be aware of the latest  threats  o The TSP should establish an adequate level of logging in all information systems   Respond to incidents in a quick, effective, and reasonable way  o TSPs should have an incident response team  o The TSP should provide means to register any incident in a standardized format so  that incident management personnel can response more effectively  o Have (cold or hot) standby systems in place to take over the duties of the main  system in case of an incident  o TSP should be able to provide subjects with services from other providers until the  operations can be resumed   After an incident, close the gaps that made it possible   Learn from past incidents – own and others’  Mitigating the impact of security incidents  Guidelines for trust services providers – Part 3  Version 1.0 – December 2013  Page  28  Annex 1 – Definitions  Asset: any person, facility, material, information or activity that has value to the organization, its  business operations and their continuity, including Information resources that support the  organization's mission.

threats, vulnerabilities,  consequences and incident scenarios) that will identify and evaluate the risks:  o System scope delimitation: Determining the scope included in the risk assessment  and its boundaries  o Asset identification: Identifying any type of item that has value to the organization  and that could cause damage if it is involved in an incident.  o Threat analysis: identifying all agents, either natural or human made, accidental or  intentional, internal or external, that could pose a threat to the organization.  o Vulnerability analysis: Identifying all potential weakness in the organization that  could facilitate a successful attack and cause damage to the assets.  o Consequence determination: Identifying the possible consequences that different  events could have on the organization.  o Incident scenario identification: Determining the possible events that could have an  impact on the organization and that will serve as a base to identify the risks.   Risk analysis: Determining the risk level based on the impact of each incident scenario and  their probability of occurrence.   Risk evaluation: Producing a scored list of all the identified risks, based on the risk analysis  results; the business criteria; the affected assets and their vulnerabilities and the potential  threats.

Mitigating the impact of security incidents  Guidelines for trust services providers – Part 3  Version 1.0 – December 2013  Page  iv  Executive summary  E-Government services have significant potential to make public services more efficient for the  benefit of citizens and businesses in terms of time and money. And while these benefits are  increasingly being felt nationally, e-Government services still face administrative and legal barriers  on a cross-border level, although pan-European projects like STORK2 have shown that technical  issues of interoperability of electronic identifications can be overcome. In order to remove existing  barriers for cross-border e-ID based services the European Commission has proposed in June 2012 a  draft regulation on electronic identification and trust services for electronic transactions in the  internal market [38], which will replace the existing Electronic Signature Directive 1999/93/EC [37].  The main goals of this action are to:   ensure mutual recognition and acceptance of electronic identification across borders   give legal effect and mutual recognition to trust services   enhance current rules on e-signatures   provide a legal framework for electronic seals, time stamping, electronic document  acceptability, electronic delivery and website authentication.   ensure minimal security level of trust services providers systems   enforce obligation of notifications about security incidents at trust services providers  In Article 15 of the above mentioned draft regulation the EC proposes that trust services providers  have to demonstrate due diligence, in relation to the identification of risks and adoption of  appropriate security practices, and notify competent bodies of any breach of security or loss of  integrity that has a significant impact on the trust service provided and on the personal data  maintained therein.  In this context, the European Union Agency for Network and Information Security (ENISA) developed  in 2013 the Guidelines for trust services providers, discussing the minimal security levels to be  maintained by the trust services providers. The study is split into three parts:  Security framework: describing the framework surrounding trust service providers (TPSs), focusing  on EU standards, but taking into account others where relevant.  Risk assessment: discussing the principles and concepts of managing the risks applicaple to TSPs by  defining and controlling threats and vulnerabilities.  Mitigating the impact of security incidents: recommending measures to mitigate the impact of  security incidents on trust service providers (TSP) by proposing suitable technical and organisational  means to handle the security risks posed to the TSP.  All three parts can also be used separately, as they address different issues and target different  audience, so the introductory sections overlap.  This document, Part 3: Mitigating security incidents, recommends measures to mitigate the impact  of security incidents on trust service providers (TSP) by proposing suitable technical and  organisational means to handle the security risks posed to the TSP. This is done using a certification  service provider (CSP) as representative example. The document focuses on the concepts and  entities of hierarchical public key infrastructures (PKI), leaving other concepts, such as web of trust,  out of scope.  Understanding which entities and processes are involved in trust services and which possible  impacts derive from security incidents is the first step of a proper risk management approach. The  2  https://www.eid-stork.eu/  https://www.eid-stork.eu/  Mitigating the impact of security incidents  Guidelines for trust services providers – Part 3  Version 1.0 – December 2013  Page  v  most important entities involved in trust services include: the certificate authority (CA), the  registration authority (RA), the subject, the relying party, and others such as the time stamping  authority (TSA) and the validation authority (VA). The major processes involved in trust services  include: registration,  certification, CA key management, subject key & certificate management,  revocation and other processes such as validation or time-stamping. The main impacts of a TSP  security incident include: Identity theft, eavesdropping, signature forgery, service unavailability, and  repudiation damage.  In order to understand the possible security related situations the TSP might face it is important to  develop an understanding of possible incident scenarios and attack vectors. The major incident  scenarios include: the compromise of major TSP building blocks such as the CA, the RA, the  revocation services, or the cryptographic modules, a repudiation claim, an impersonation, a personal  data breach, the compromise of a subject key, and the loss of service availability. The ENISA survey3  reveals that TSP providers see a CA compromise as the scenario with the biggest impact (8.7 of 10),  while the compromise of a subject’s key pair is seen as the scenario with the lowest impact (4.3 of  10) on the TSP. The same report also reveals that a compromise of the CA is deemed by the TSPs the  least probable scenario, while the compromise of a subject’s key pair is seen as the most probable  scenario. The major attack vectors include: logical attacks, cryptographic attacks, insider attacks, and  physical attacks. Following said surrey, most TSPs consider logical attacks the most likely (56% say  highly likely or likely) while physical attacks are considered the most unlikely (89% say unlikely or  very unlikely).  Preparing for possible incidents is one of the most important steps in impact mitigation as it allows  the TSP to be able to respond quickly and effectively in case of an incident. Amongst the most  important procedures and information gathering capabilities are: alert gathering capability, incident  response capability, having staff and systems incident ready, established means of communication  with stakeholders, and ready to go contingency plans.  In order to be able to actually react (in an appropriate way) to an incident, the TSP must be able to  detect and assess incidents. Amongst the most important indicators for a security incident are:  fraudulent certificate activities, abnormal activities in information systems, suspicious information in  the certificate lifecycle management logs, unaccounted key media, loss of availability, and loss of  custody of subject key.  Once an incident is detected, an effective and prompt response is critical for mitigating the impact of  a breach in a TSP. In order to select an appropriate response, breaches are classified into the  following two general types: breaches that compromise the integrity of the trust service and  breaches that don’t compromise the integrity of the trust service (availability is not taken into  account in this classification). Depending on the type of breach, the focus of handling the incident  differs. In the former case, the priority in response is always to limit the damage, even if this has as a  consequence the temporal unavailability of the service for legitimate users. In the latter case, the  priority in response depends on the type of incident: with personal data breaches, to protect the  confidentiality of the data; with loss of availability, to recover the service; with repudiation claim, to  ensure traceability and accountability of actions.  Once the source of the compromise has been determined and the appropriate response actions to  mitigate the impact of the incident have been taken, the TSP should take the appropriate measures  to minimize the possibility of the incident occurring again. The main measures the TSP should take  3  For the in-depth description of the study, please refer to the document “TSP services, standards and risk  analysis report”, ENISA 2013.

Learning from past incidents (own and at other TSPs) is crucial in IT security in general. Many TSP  have already been affected by an incident during the course of their operations. Lessons can already  be learned from a variety of real world incidents4.  4  Description and analysis can be found in Section 8.

2013  Page  1  1 Introduction  This document provides recommendations on means of mitigating the impact of security incidents  consisting of appropriate technical and organisational measures to manage the risks affecting the  security of trust service provides (TSP). We use certificate service providers (CSP) as a representative  case for all types of TSP. The document is geared to what is called hierarchical public key  infrastructures (PKI) and the respective concepts and entities. Other concepts, such as web of trust,  are out of scope of this document and are not considered.  The document starts with a high level introduction to TSPs, including involved entities, processes and  impact analysis of security incidents. After that, the document covers the topics of identifying,  preparing, detecting, responding, and eradicating incidents in more detail. The document closes with  lessons learned from past real world incidents.  The general rule of security being a constant process of iteration, learning, and improvement also  applies to the measures presented in this document.  The National Institute of Technology and Standards (NIST) is currently preparing a cybersecurity  framework for critical infrastructures [35]. This framework is to a major extent applicable to manage  cybersecurity-related risk to TSPs, and is recommended as complimentary reference to standards,  guidelines, and best practices in the field.  Mitigating the impact of security incidents  Guidelines for trust services providers – Part 3  Version 1.0 – December 2013  Page  2  2 Trust service provider entities, processes, and impact  2.1 Entities involved in trust services  Traditionally, the technology used by TSPs is public key encryption. Understanding the different  entities involved in the trust service processes is important to be able to determine the different  types of incidents that may take place in trust services. Each incident scenario affects an entity or  process in the trust service. Amongst the entities involved in trust services are:  2.1.1 Certificate Authority  Certificate Authorities (CAs) are the actual issuers of electronic certificates. TSPs providing electronic  certificates have one or several CAs managing the whole certificate lifecycle, with the exception of  the registration process which is done by the Registration Authority (see below). Root CAs  usually  generate and maintain their own key pair which they use to sign the certificates they issue (and  usually provide certificates for other CAs). CAs act as a trust anchor: when an entity presents its  certificate to a relying party (see below), it is the signature by a trusted CA in the certificate that  provides assurance to the relying party that the certificate is legitimate and valid.  2.1.2 Registration Authority  The Registration Authority (RA) is the entity that verifies the certificate requester’s identity to ensure  that the certificate is issued to the legitimate subject. One RA may be connected with several CAs  and one CA may be connected with several RAs. Once the identity is verified, the RA sends a  certificate request to the CA, which will then produce an electronic certificate and deliver it to the  subject. The RA can be part of the TSP or it may be an external entity with some type of contract or  agreement with the TSP. As an example could serve a small TSP requiring physical presence of the  subject for identification purposes. This TSP may delegate the registration activity to an existing  external authority, as deploying physical offices may not be feasible for the TSP itself.  2.1.3 Subject  The subject is the entity whose identity is bound to some other data contained in the certificate  issued by the TSP, e.g. the certificate binds this entity’s identity to its public key. Subjects can be  natural persons (e.g. electronic signature certificates) or legal entities (e.g. electronic seals or web  authentication certificates). Subjects (or representatives) request from TSPs certificates which they  use for many different purposes, such as electronic signatures, authentication or encryption.  Subjects are bound to a certificate by the signature of the CA, which vows for their identity.  2.1.4 Relying party  The relying party is an entity that relies on the services and tokens (e.g. certificates) issued by the  TSP. Relying parties can be persons, services, devices, or any other entity. Examples are email users,  signature validation platforms, online services, browsers, etc.  2.1.5 Other entities  There are more possible entities involved in trust services. Examples include additional TSP  authorities providing core services such as revocation services or validation services. Other examples  are entities providing additional services such as time stamping services, authentication services,  signature services, or long-term archiving. Although these and other entities are not in the focus of  the document, the recommendations apply to them analogously.  Mitigating the impact of security incidents  Guidelines for trust services providers – Part 3  Version 1.0 – December 2013  Page  3  2.2 Processes involved in trust services  Understanding the processes that take place in providing trust services is important to determine  which processes may be affected by an incident. Attackers will try to exploit vulnerabilities in any of  the processes, and successful attacks on the different processes will have different consequences.  Amongst the modules in a trust service are:  2.2.1 Registration process  The registration process comprises all procedures which are in place to register a subject with a TSP,  such as:   Subject applies at TSP   Subject presents a proof of identity and maybe its eligibility (this step may be missing)   TSP registers subject or refuses to do so  2.2.2 Certification process  The certification process comprises all procedures which are in place to provide a subject with a  certificate, such as:   Subject requests a certificate at the RA   RA sends a certificate request to the CA   CA issues certificate   Certificate and keys delivery to subject  2.2.3 CA key management process  The CA key management process comprises all procedures which are in place to manage the CA key  pair during its complete lifecycle, such as:   CA key pair generation   CA key pair storage   CA key pair backup   CA key pair recovery   CA public key dissemination (e.g. by self-signed certificate)   CA key pair decommissionning   CA key pair archiving   Subject key management process  This key certificate management process comprises all procedures which are in place to manage the  subject keys, such as:   Subject key pair generation   Subject key pair provisioning (e.g. by device provisioning)   Subject key pair storage   CA key pair backup   CA key pair recovery  Logically the revocation of subject key pair (subection 2.2.6) can be also considered as part of this  process.  Mitigating the impact of security incidents  Guidelines for trust services providers – Part 3  Version 1.0 – December 2013  Page  4  2.2.4 Subject certificate management process  The subject certificate management process comprises all procedures which are in place to manage  subject certificates, such as:   Subject certificate generation   Subject certificate delivery   Subject certificate renewal, rekey and update   Subject certificate dissemination   Subject certificate suspension  2.2.5 Revocation process  The revocation process comprises all procedures which are in place to revoke certificates, such as:   Certificate revocation request   Certificate revocation   Certificate revocation publishing (e.g. CRL, OCSP).  2.2.6 Other processes and services  There are more processes involved in trust services. Examples include:   Validation services (core to certificate management)   Time stamping services   Authentication services   Signature services   Long-term archiving  Although these and other processes are not in the focus of the document, the recommendations can  apply to them by analogy, taking into account they differences in nature.  2.3 Impact of security incidents  It is important to understand the consequences of a security incident to comprehend why it is critical  for TSPs to respond promptly and appropriately to incidents. Most operations in the Internet that  require a high assurance of proof of identity rely nowadays on the use of electronic certificates.  Amongst the main consequences of a compromise of a TSP are:  2.3.1 Assuming the identity of another entity  Entities present digital certificates to relying parties in order to link their identity with the  corresponding public key. Once verified, the relying party will accept the identity of the entity as  correct. This process can be applied for any authentication purposes, for example, an entity  accessing a system or a web page presenting itself to a user.  If a malicious entity manages to circumvent, break, or another unlawful operation on this process,  e.g. by forging certificates, it is able to assume the subject’s identity and act in its name.  2.3.2 Eavesdropping on private communications  On the Internet, sensitive communication between entities is often secured against eavesdropping  and spoofing, e.g. Web sites by means of TLS. In these processes, electronic certificates play a major  role in exchanging the respective keys. Once verified, the relying party will deem the communication  confidential.  Mitigating the impact of security incidents  Guidelines for trust services providers – Part 3  Version 1.0 – December 2013  Page  5  If a malicious entity managed to interfere with this, e.g. by mounting a man in the middle attack  using fake certificates, it would be able to eavesdrop on the communication.  2.3.3 Forging electronic signatures  Where the legal framework allows it (through appropriate legal acts, which is the case in most major  jurisdictions), electronic signatures can be used for the same purpose as handwritten signatures;  they can be used to make legal commitments, like signing a contract or submitting a tax declaration,  etc. Certificates play a major role in the verification of signatures, establishing authenticity and non- repudiation.  Being able to forge an electronic signature, e.g. by gaining unauthorized access to the signature key,  enables the attacker to sign arbitrary documents in the victim’s name.  2.3.4 Unavailability of services  A TSP provides services to other parties. These other parties rely on the TSP for services such as key  generation, certificate issuance, and revocation checking.  Being able to delay or even entirely stop the TSPs services, e.g. the OCSP server5, enables the  attacker to interfere with the day-to-day operations of the parties relying on them.  2.3.5 Reputation damage  The business of a TSP stands and falls with its reputation. As having a good reputation is a necessary  condition for being trusted and chosen by clients, having a bad reputation is sufficient to not being  trusted.  If an attacker manages to cause serious security incidents, not only the security is at stake but also  the TSPs reputation and thereby its entire business.  5  Online Certificate Status Protocol, described in RFC 6960 [25]  Mitigating the impact of security incidents  Guidelines for trust services providers – Part 3  Version 1.0 – December 2013  Page  6  3 Identifying incident scenarios and attack vectors  After identifying the entities, processes and possible impacts on TSPs, it is important to develop an  understanding of possible incident scenarios and attack vectors to understand the possible  situations the trust service provider (TSP) might face.  3.1 Incident scenarios  Incident scenarios define possible types of events that could affect an organization and cause  negative consequences. The importance of identifying incident scenarios is that it helps the  organization to make a classification of incidents when they occur, and to have a protocol for  response based on the characteristics and possible consequences of the incident.  ENISA identified a group of incident scenarios6 that classifies the identified type of events that could  affect a (TSP) and that can be used by TSPs as a reference. In the following paragraphs, a description  of the identified incident scenarios is provided. Although all descriptions given here focus on  technical issues, it is possible to provoke the same incidents by organizational means, such as social  engineering or coercion. In addition, most of the incidents can also be provoked by accident or  human error.  3.1.1 Compromise of a Certificate Authority  Relying parties use the electronic signature of the CA in certificates as an attestation of the  legitimacy of the certificate. If attackers control the CA private keys, they can generate fake  certificates which relying parties will accept as valid because they are signed by the CA. To achieve  this, the attacker would need either access to the CA private signing key, or access to the certificate  signing applications of the CA which activate the key (avoidable in case where principles of  segregation of duties and dual control are put in place).  3.1.2 Compromise of a Registration Authority  The role of the Registration Authority is to verify the subject identity and to subsequently send a  certificate issuance request to the Certificate Authority. Although the RA doesn’t generate the  certificates itself, compromises to its systems or keys could lead equally to fraudulent certificate  issuance. The main objective of an attacker compromising a RA is the generation of fraudulent  certificate requests that are accepted by the CA as legitimate. To compromise the RA, an attacker  may obtain access to the RA key and manage to send fraudulent requests to the CA, or succeed to  intrude its certificate request generation systems or intrude and tamper with the communication  channel between the RA and the CA.  3.1.3 Compromise of the revocation services  It is important that the information regarding the status of certificates is correct, complete and  available 24x7 so that e.g. no revoked certificates are accepted as valid. The goal of a revocation  service compromise may be to modify the revocation services so that revoked certificates appear as  valid, to erase a revocation request so that a compromised certificate is not revoked, to disrupt  legitimate user operations by invalidating revocation status information, or to fraudulently revoke  valid certificates.  6  Please refer to “Guidelines for trust service providers, part 2 – Risk assessment”  Mitigating the impact of security incidents  Guidelines for trust services providers – Part 3  Version 1.0 – December 2013  Page  7  3.1.4 Compromise of the cryptographic modules  A compromise of cryptographic modules occurs when the cryptographic algorithms, parameters,  protocols, or implementations (SW or HW) become insecure. If, for example, the algorithm used to  generate the CA or subject key pairs become insecure, an attacker could deduce or replicate the  private key. Another possibility is that the actual signature /encryption algorithm is weak, enabling  an attacker to generate fake signatures / decrypt messages without having access to the private key.  Note that bad parameters or implementations (SW or HW) can very well lead to weaknesses despite  the fact that the  algorithm or protocol being used is secure.  3.1.5 Repudiation claim by certificate subject  A repudiation claim occurs when a subject denies having performed the actions that are attributed  to him/her by the certificate usage. A repudiation claim may be legitimate when it is the  consequence of another type of breach, such as compromised subject keys, or may be fraudulent  when the subject simply wants to deny actions actually performed by him/her by questioning the  security of the provider.  3.1.6 Impersonation  An impersonation occurs when a malicious entity assumes the identity of another entity with the  objective to commit a malicious act. In our case, this means an attacker assumes the identity of a  subject e.g. in order to gain access rights to confidential information, or fraudulently act otherwise in  the name of the victim.  3.1.7 Personal data breach  A personal data breach occurs when personal data provided to or produced by the TSP are disclosed  to unauthorized entities. Personal data maintained by the TSP include information contained in the  certificates (which is available to everyone), the registration records and the audit logs, aside from  staff or business relation data. A personal data breach can imply legal and economic sanctions from  supervisory authorities, and can seriously damage the reputation of the TSP.  3.1.8 Compromise of a subject’s private key  Subjects use their private keys to sign documents, authenticate to systems or decrypt messages or  communications. Subject’s private keys should be under their sole custody, or, when foreseen by the  certificate policy, under the TSP custody, always following strong security procedures to protect the  confidentiality and integrity of the key. A compromise of a subject private key occurs when the  subject (or the TSP on its behalf) loses exclusive custody of its private key, effectively allowing an  attacker to supplant his/her identity or access confidential information.  3.1.9 Loss of availability of services  An incident affecting the availability of the CA or RA systems can have negative effects for the  reputation of the TSP. If there is temporary unavailability of requesting a new certificate or renewing  one this incident might not seriously affect the trust in the CA. But if the revocation management  systems are unavailable, this is a serious issue, as proper certificate usage is impeded.  Mitigating the impact of security incidents  Guidelines for trust services providers – Part 3  Version 1.0 – December 2013  Page  8  3.1.10 Impact and probability of incident scenarios  In June and July 2013 ENISA conducted a survey among trust services providers, in which 46  participants took part. The goal of this survey was to identify security practices in force at these  organisations7.  Among others, it asked respondents to rate the incident scenarios in terms of impact and probability  of occurrence for any TSP.  Figure 1 shows the results of the incident impact questionnaire. The estimated impact value  represents the median impact score assigned by the trust service providers participating in the  survey. Impact scores range from 10 (very high) to 0 (very low). We can see that the compromise of  the CA is rated as worst scenario with a very high impact (8.7 of 10). The lowest rate is assigned to  the compromise of a subject’s key pair having still a medium impact (4.3 of 10). The ratings of the  other scenarios are nearly linearly distributed between these two impact levels.  Figure 1: Estimated incident impact (based on survey results)  Figure 2 shows the results of the incident probability questionnaire. The estimated probability value  represents the median probability score assigned by the 41 trust service providers participating in  the survey. Probability scores range from 10 (very likely) to 0 (very unlikely). We can see that the  repudiation claim by certificate subject is rated as most likely scenario with a medium probability.  The least likely scenario is the compromise of the CA having a low probability. The second least likely  7  For the in-depth description of the study, please refer to the document “TSP services, standards and risk  analysis report”, ENISA 2013. The participants are mentioned in the acknowledgements at the beginning of  this document.  Mitigating the impact of security incidents  Guidelines for trust services providers – Part 3  Version 1.0 – December 2013  Page  9  scenario is the compromise of the revocation services already scratching medium probability. The  ratings of the other scenarios are nearly linearly distributed between the probability levels of the  most likely and second least likely scenario.  Figure 2: Estimated incident probability (based on survey results)  3.2 Attack vectors  An attack vector is a path or means by which an attack can be or is made8. Attack vectors help to  identify which are the possible points of entry an attacker may use when trying to penetrate a  system. Based on the characteristics of trust service providers, we use four attack vectors that can  be used to compromise a TSP operation. In the following paragraphs, a description of these attack  vectors is provided. Although all descriptions given here focus on technical issues, it is possible to  open the same attack vectors by organizational means, such as social engineering or coercion. In  addition, most of the attack vectors can also be opened by accident or human error.  3.2.1 Logical attacks  Logical attacks consist of attempts to infiltrate the CA or RA systems in order to manipulate them  with the goal of obtaining access to private keys, producing fraudulent certificates or tampering with  revocation information. Trust services rely to a high extent on cryptography, however the set of  information systems build upon the cryptographic modules are also an important component of the  trust service.  CA and RA information systems may be subject to attacks that can result in fraudulent certificate  issuance without actual access to any private key. For example, intrusion in a RA system can lead to  fraudulent certificate request. Note that it is also possible to attack the subject’s system to gain  access to fraudulent certificates or provoke or prevent revocations.  To protect themselves from logical attacks, TSPs should implement perimeter security measures and  all kind of security tools on their networks. The TSP should also apply secure personal security  8  http://web.mit.edu/mitei/research/studies/documents/electric-grid-2011/Electric_Grid_Full_Report.pdf,  Glossary  http://web.mit.edu/mitei/research/studies/documents/electric-grid-2011/Electric_Grid_Full_Report.pdf  Mitigating the impact of security incidents  Guidelines for trust services providers – Part 3  Version 1.0 – December 2013  Page  10  environments (PSE), such as smart cards, as end user devices and promote the usage of secure  connectivity equipment, such as certified card readers with PIN pad and display, and stress the  importance of secured and up-to-date end user equipment, such as antivirus software and correct  patch level.  3.2.2 Cryptographic attacks  Cryptographic attacks have an important impact on trust services, as the core technological  component sustaining trust services is public key cryptography. The security of public key  infrastructures depends, amongst others, heavily on the strength of the cryptographic algorithms,  parameters, protocols, and implementations (SW or HW) they use. Cryptographers study  permanently the existing cryptographic modules to determine whether they are vulnerable to the  different existing types of attacks.  Attackers will try to compromise the security of cryptographic modules using vulnerabilities in order  to compromise the security of the system.  To protect themselves from cryptographic attacks, TSPs should update their cryptographic  parameters (e.g. key length), implementations (e.g. crypto libraries or HSMs), protocols (e.g. key  exchange), and even algorithms (e.g. hash algorithm) whenever indicated.  3.2.3 Insider attacks  Trust services are operated by people, and the security of the process relies to a certain extent on  them.  Insider attacks are those conducted by the TSP personnel. This type of attack is usually hard to  detect.  TSPs should implement measures such as logging and auditing and double control for the critical  operations to avoid relying on any single person.  3.2.4 Physical attacks  Trust services are conducted at some physical location, where the actual hardware, software and  key material are installed.  TSPs may be subject to attacks that try to compromise their physical security in order to gain access  to applications or key material or to interfere with TSP processes.  TSPs should implement strict physical security controls, especially in all areas where keys are stored  or activated, making this type of attack difficult to implement. Additionally, private TSP keys should  be stored in tamper resistant hardware media (originals and possible backups) and shouldn’t be  extracted from this media at any point, except for redundancy, backup, or recovery purposes.  3.2.5 Probability of occurrence of attack vectors  The ENISA survey on security practices of trust service providers asked respondents to rate the  identified attack vectors in terms of probability of materialization for any TSP. The values were  assigned by the 41 TSPs participating in the survey, from 1 (very unlikely) to 4 (highly likely).  The results, depicted in Figure 3, show that logical attacks are considered the most probable by most  respondents (56% say highly likely or likely), followed by insider attacks (55% say likely or unlikely)  and cryptographic attacks (55% say unlikely or very unlikely). Physical attacks are considered by the  respondents the less likely to occur (89% say unlikely or very unlikely).  Mitigating the impact of security incidents  Guidelines for trust services providers – Part 3  Version 1.0 – December 2013  Page  11  Figure 3: Attack vector occurrence probability (based on survey results)  Mitigating the impact of security incidents  Guidelines for trust services providers – Part 3  Version 1.0 – December 2013  Page  12  4 Preparing for incidents  One of the most important phases for responding to an incident in any kind of ICT service is to  prepare beforehand all the procedures and necessary information to be able to respond quickly and  effectively if an incident takes place. Appropriate policy is an instrument to prepare and to provide  notice to service users and supervisory authorities. This section provides recommendations on what  kind of aspects a TSP should prepare.  4.1 Enable means to gather alerts  4.1.1 Enable outside parties to report incidents  Incidents in TSPs may in many cases be detected by certificate holders, relying parties or any other  outside party. They should be able to easily report suspicious activity associated to certificates  issued by the TSP. The TSP should establish a support line or helpdesk where any information  regarding suspicious activity can be received.  4.1.2 Enable systems for staff to report abnormal events  Not all incidents will arrive from outside the TSP, for example suspicious log activity will be detected  by the TSP personnel. The TSP should provide means for them to register any incidence in a  standardized format so that incident management personnel can response more effectively.  4.1.3 Follow alert systems from external sources  Suspicions of compromises of trust services or cryptographic algorithms, parameters, protocols, and  implementations (SW or HW)  may be published, e.g. in Internet, even before the TSP is aware. The  TSP should follow security alert systems and forums and be aware of the latest threats.  4.1.4 Activate alerts in internal systems  The TSP should establish an adequate level of logging in all information systems, revise logs  periodically, and enable systems that alert personnel when suspicious activities appear in systems  logs.  4.1.5 Conduct continuous self monitoring and self testing  The TSP should foster a culture of self monitoring and self testing. This includes actively trying to  break the own systems by all available means such as penetration and vulnerability testing.  Whenever indicated, an alarm should be raised through the established channels.  4.2 Create an incident response capability  4.2.1 Create an incident response team  TSPs should have an incident response team. Different configurations and capabilities of an incident  response team exist, the TSP should define it according to its characteristics and their risk  assessment. Amongst the questions to answer are:   Whether a 24x7 incident response capability is needed (which seems appropriate for at  revocation services at least)   The size of the team, whether they will part-time or full time, and the needed skills of the  personnel.   Whether central incident management response or distributed incident response is applied.  Mitigating the impact of security incidents  Guidelines for trust services providers – Part 3  Version 1.0 – December 2013  Page  13  4.2.2 Create incident response procedures  After determining different incident types that may occur, the TSP should define procedures for  incident management. Having ready procedures will improve and speed up response when dealing  with an incident. This should also include realistic response drills.  4.3 Prepare staff and systems for an incident  4.3.1 Assign roles and responsibilities  Have an updated list of roles and responsibilities of staff in case of an incident. This applies not just  to those directly involved in managing the incident, but for all personnel operating CA functions. All  personnel should have clear instructions on how to proceed in case of an incident affecting their  functions.  4.3.2 Train personnel  Conduct incident response exercises periodically in order for the involved staff to be able to handle  incidents properly.  4.3.3 Put redundancy or fail-safe mechanisms in place  Have (cold or hot) standby systems in place to take over the duties of the main system in case of an  incident. Consider applying fail-safe cryptographic modules, mechanisms such as forward secure  signatures and / or utilizing fundamentally different crypto modules in parallel.  4.4 Have means of communication with all stakeholders  4.4.1 Create a repository of certificate holders contact information  The TSP should establish, if appropriate according to local legislation and field of use, a database of  issued certificates with the contact information of all the certificate holders and keep it updated.  This will speed up the process of contacting them in case an incident takes place with their  certificate.  4.4.2 Create a repository of relying parties  The TSP should establish a database with contact information regarding (known) relying parties (or  their representatives) that use their certificates, such as government sites or trust stores for web  browsers, in order to facilitate the process of contacting them if an incident takes place.  4.5 Create a repository of supervisors and competent authorities  The TSP should establish a database with contact information regarding supervisors and competent  authorities. Qualified EU providers (and all providers operating in Europe when the new Proposal for  a Regulation comes into force) have to inform supervisory authorities of any security incident  affecting the service without undue delay. Additionally, the TSP needs to inform data protection  authorities and under certain conditions data subjects when personal data are breached. It is also  recommendable to have contacts with competent CERTs. Knowing the appropriate channels for  communication will facilitate the process if an incident occurs.  Mitigating the impact of security incidents  Guidelines for trust services providers – Part 3  Version 1.0 – December 2013  Page  14  4.6 Have contingency plans  The typical approach is to have backup sites (hot and/or cold) as well as business continuity plans,  but also the following.  4.6.1 Have agreements with other TSPs to obtain substitute certificates  In the very critical situation where certificates need to be replaced, and none of the TSP’s CAs, RAs  or revocation services can be trusted or are unavailable, the TSP should be able to provide subjects  with services from other providers until the operations can be resumed with their own systems. This  will minimize the impact on subjects.  4.6.2 Maintain updated information of your environment  The TSP should have documented information regarding all data that can be helpful in case of an  incident, such as:   Lists of assets   Network diagrams   Applications and software versions   Disaster procedures   Recover and restore procedures   Contingency plans  4.6.3 Have a service termination plan  In case the TSP decides for any reason or is forced to discontinue operations, there should be a plan  in place to ensure that the services go down smoothly. E.g. make sure that issued certificates can be  still verified or revoked from external sources. In some countries the succession of service in case of  termination is obligatory for accredited CAs.  Mitigating the impact of security incidents  Guidelines for trust services providers – Part 3  Version 1.0 – December 2013  Page  15  5 Detecting and assessing the incident  Detection of an incident in a TSP may be triggered by different events. Reports may arrive to the TSP  through the helpdesk or support contact addresses, be detected by staff in the internal systems or  even by media and public sources.  Although not all unusual events will correspond to an actual incident, they are indicators and should  be investigated by the TSP. During the detection phase, the TSP first line respondent should  determine whether an incident is actually taking place. Training of personnel is important to help  them to detect abnormal behaviour. Also, there should be a review process to assure that no  incident slipped through due to wrong assessment.  If the TSP first line respondent assesses an incident may be occurring, the next phase is the incident  analysis. From the moment an event is classified as an incident, all evidence should be preserved in  case it will be needed at a further stage.  The goal of the analysis phase is to determine the type of incident and execute the appropriate  response plan. Events that indicate an incident, especially those concerning the detection of  fraudulent certificate activities, are linked to different types of TSP incidents.  The TSP personnel should assess the circumstances of the breach, the information systems affected  and all other relevant information to determine the type of breach. Correlation of events, training of  personnel and existing procedures play an important role is this phase.  The following paragraphs provide some guidelines regarding different abnormal events that may  take place in a TSP and how to assess them in order to identify the appropriate type of incident that  is taking place.  5.1 Fraudulent certificate activities  An indicator that some kind of certificate compromise might be taking place is reported; for  example:   Certificates associated with man in the middle attacks   Certificates associated to known malware sites   Malware signed with certificates   Subjects reporting that certificates associated with their name/organization do not belong to  them   Subjects that report usage of their certificates that they didn’t do themselves.   Attempts to use invalid or revoked certificates  Fraudulent certificate activity may indicate different types of compromises. In order to determine  what part of the trust service is compromised, at least the following steps should be followed:   Analyse the potential fraudulent activity to determine the certificates’ origin and verify that  they are linked to a CA of the TSP.   Contact the certificate subjects’ to assess whether fraudulent activities are taking place.   Assess the circumstances under which the certificate was issued:  o Contact the RA to check registration logs and records.  o Check certificate request and generation logs at CA.  If any of the above investigations leads to a suspicion that there is a bogus certificate, the TSP should  proceed to analyse suspicious activities in the certificate lifecycle management and abnormal logs in  the information systems and finally come to a decision whether there is a breach or not and react  accordingly.  Mitigating the impact of security incidents  Guidelines for trust services providers – Part 3  Version 1.0 – December 2013  Page  16  5.2 Abnormal activities in information systems  Another incident indicator is any event in the TSP’s systems that could indicate an intrusion attempt,  for example:   Unsuccessful login requests   Unusual network traffic flows   Unusual event detection in antivirus, IPS, perimeter systems etc.   Appearance of filenames not known to the administrators   Changes in audit functions in information systems  Abnormal log entries in information systems may come as a triggering event themselves, or they  may be detected upon revision of systems when other suspicious activities are taking place. The TSP  should analyse whether the logs point to an intrusion being successful. If that is case, the TSP should  check for suspicious activities in the certificate lifecycle management to determine whether the  intruder actually managed to create fraudulent certificates. Be aware that an intruder, once in the  system, may be able to cover its tracks.  5.3 Suspicious information in the certificate lifecycle management logs  Suspicious information in the certificate lifecycle management logs may come as a triggering event  itself, when personnel operating CA or RA functions detect strange certificate requests, issuances or  revocations; or it may be detected upon checking of systems when other suspicious activities are  taking place; or during standard auditing activities.  In any case, the TSP should inspect the system and check for any indication a fake certificate or  revocation was requested or generated. Amongst the indicator are:   Inconsistencies in the registration, certificate generation or revocation logs   Inconsistencies in the information associated to any certificate   Registration requests lacking associated registration records   Certificate generation or revocation lacking any request   Unusual behaviour (e.g. physical registration outside business hours)   Inconsistencies in revocation service logs (e.g. OCSP queries for not issued certificates)  If there is an indication of an incident, the TSP should assess the type of incident taking place by  checking the different logs and correlating information from the different systems involved in the  certification process. For example:   Certificate requests logs with no associated registration records can be indicators of an RA  compromise.   Logs in the CA certificate generation systems that are not associated to any matching  certificate requests from an RA could be an indication of a CA compromise.   Suspicious certificates that have no associated certificate generation logs in the CA systems  can indicate a CA compromise or a compromise of the cryptographic modules.   Registration records that seem inconsistent may indicate an impersonation incident.   Frequent revocation status requests (e.g. OCSP) for certificates that have no corresponding  certificate issued may indicate a CA compromise incident.  Mitigating the impact of security incidents  Guidelines for trust services providers – Part 3  Version 1.0 – December 2013  Page  17  5.4 Unaccounted key media  The TSP should maintain an inventory of all physical media storing key material and periodically  verify that all media is accounted for. Any key media handling or storage device unaccounted for  should be considered an indication of a compromise:   CA key storage devices   CA operators’ keys   RA key storage devices   RA operators’ keys   Subjects’ keys   Key backup media  The TSP should assess the circumstances under which the key handling material was lost to  determine whether it was due to accidental or intentional events, and whether fraudulent certificate  or revocation issuance could have occurred. In any case the suitable measures should be taken to  deal with the unaccounted media.  5.5 Loss of availability  Loss of availability of the TSP systems can be the consequence of an intrusion attempt or be due to  accidental events. In any case it should be treated as an incident and its source should be  investigated. In the event of a loss of availability, the TSP should immediately restore the availability  of critical systems, such as revocation services, e.g. by switching to standby systems. The TSP should  also assess whether there any accidental causes that could explain a disruption, such as loss of  essential services, natural hazards, etc. but also investigate other potential causes.  If no external event seems to be the cause of the disruption, the TSP should determine the origin of  the system malfunction by checking information systems logs. When the source of the system  malfunction is established, the next step is to check whether it was the consequence of any  intentional action.  5.6 Loss of custody of subject key  Reports by a subject of loss of sole custody of its private key can point to an accidental loss or to an  attempt of compromising a subject key. The TSP should assist the subject in determining whether  any fraudulent activity is taking place.  Mitigating the impact of security incidents  Guidelines for trust services providers – Part 3  Version 1.0 – December 2013  Page  18  6 Responding to the incident  An effective and prompt response is critical for mitigating the impact of a breach in a TSP.  6.1 Types of breaches  Incidents at TSPs can be divided into two general types, and this classification plays an important  role in selecting the appropriate response. The two mentioned types are:  6.1.1 Breaches that compromise the integrity of the trust service  These incidents, or compromises, imply access to private keys, ability to infiltrate systems that  activate these keys or any kind of illegitimate access to any process involved in the certificate  generation. Such incidents can have as a consequence the fraudulent generation, use, or revocation  of certificates, and therefore require immediate revocation of all fake certificates generated or  appropriate handling of fake revocations. In some cases, even the revocation of all certificates issued  by a certain CA, including the root certificate may be indicated. Among these incidents are:   Compromise of a Certificate Authority   Compromise of a Registration Authority   Compromise of the revocation services   Compromise of the cryptographic modules   Impersonation of a valid subject   Loss of availability of revocation services  In incidents that compromise the integrity of the trust service, the priority in response is always to  limit the damage, even if this has as a consequence the temporal unavailability of the service for  legitimate users.  6.1.2 Breaches that don’t compromise the integrity of the trust service  These types of incidents do not require revocation of certificates; therefore the response protocol is  different. In any case, they may have very negative consequences for the TSP. Among these  incidents are:   Personal data breach   Loss of availability of the trust services other than revocation   Repudiation claim   Unability to validate the certificate  With incidents that do not compromise the integrity of the trust service, the priority in response  depends on the type of incident: with personal data breaches, to protect the confidentiality of the  data; with loss of availability, to recover the service; with repudiation claim, to ensure traceability  and accountability of actions.  6.2 Response guidance  The following sections provide guidance on how to respond to different incident scenarios in TSPs.  6.2.1 Responding to a CA compromise  When a CA compromise is detected, it is critical for the TSP to take prompt and appropriate  measures to mitigate the impact of the breach. The goal is to prevent any further usage of  fraudulent certificates. At least, the following actions should be undertaken:  Mitigating the impact of security incidents  Guidelines for trust services providers – Part 3  Version 1.0 – December 2013  Page  19   Discontinue any new certificate issuance from the affected CA.   Revoke the CA certificate (which automatically revokes all certificates issued by the CA.   Update the revocation status information.   Notify relying parties and urge them to update all revocation information.   Inform affected subjects of the revocation of their certificates.   Notify competent authorities about the breach.   Provide affected subjects with substitute certificates from another CA, e.g. from a standby  system or another TSP.  If the affected CA is a root CA, follow at least these additional steps:   Revoke trust in the root CA in all trust repositories where it is included.   Provide affected subjects with substitute certificates from another CA, e.g. from a standby  system or another TSP.  6.2.2 Responding to a RA compromise  Both RA compromises and CA compromises can lead to fraudulent certificates being issued. The  response will depend on whether it can be determined which certificate requests sent by the RA  were illegitimate.  If all fraudulent certificates can be detected, revoking those certificates can be sufficient. But when  not all fraudulent certificates can be detected with certainty, it is recommended for the CA to revoke  all certificates issued by the RA, because there is no guarantee as to whether fake certificates are  being used. At least, the following actions are recommended:  If all fraudulent certificates can be identified:   Discontinue any new certificate issuance requests from the affected RA.   Revoke the RA certificate.   Revoke all fraudulent certificates.   Update the revocation status information.   Notify relying parties and urge them to update all revocation information.   Notify competent authorities about the breach.  If not all fraudulent certificates can be identified, follow at least these additionally steps:     Revoke all certificates requested from the affected RA.   Identify affected legitimate subjects and provide them with certificates from another RA,  e.g. from a standby system or another TSP.  6.2.3 Responding to a compromise of the revocation services  The goal of responding to a compromise of the revocation services is to avoid the usage of revoked  certificates and to re-establish the correctness of the revocation status information. Until revocation  information can be trusted, relying parties should not accept certificates. With this objective, at least  the following actions are recommended:   Notify relying parties and urge them not to accept any certificates from the CA until  revocation information can be trusted.   If the revocation status site seems to be compromised, set up a stand-in site for revocation  information checking, e.g. activate the standby system.   Identify the last trustable revocation status information.  Mitigating the impact of security incidents  Guidelines for trust services providers – Part 3  Version 1.0 – December 2013  Page  20   Add the legitimate revocations occurred since then to this revocation status information.   Disseminate this revocation status information.   Notify competent authorities about the breach.  6.2.4 Responding to a compromise of the cryptographic modules  Compromise of the cryptographic modules is a different event from other compromises in TSPs, as  the detection may come from external sources rather than an attack to the TSP itself. However, the  TSP should take action like in any other compromise by revoking the corresponding certificates. At  least, the following actions are recommended:   Discontinue any new certificate issuance using the compromised cryptographic modules.   Revoke all certificates issued with the compromised cryptographic modules.   Update the revocation status information.   Notify relying parties and urge them to update all revocation information.   Inform affected certificate subjects of the revocation of their certificates.   Notify competent authorities about the breach.   Provide affected certificate subjects with certificates with stronger cryptographic modules.  Note that here are proactive measures which prevent TSPs from being compromised even if (a  single) cryptographic module becomes insecure, e.g. forward secure cryptography and / or utilizing  fundamentally different crypto modules in parallel. In this case, the immediate revocation is not  necessary.  6.2.5 Responding to a repudiation claim by a certificate subject  Although a repudiation claim doesn’t imply necessarily a compromise of a certificate, it is advised in  this event to revoke the certificate, to ensure no further actions are performed with the certificate.  At least, the following actions are recommended:   Revoke the certificate to prevent any further usage.   Update the revocation status information.   Assess whether a compromise has taken place.   Gather all logs related to registration, certificate issuance and certificate usage (e.g. for  evidence purposes).  6.2.6 Responding to impersonation  An impersonation attack implies revocation of the affected certificates. Although this attack is of a  smaller scale than other compromises, in many cases it is a directed attack and can have very  damaging consequences; therefore a prompt response is needed. At least, the following actions are  recommended:   Revoke the attacked certificate(s).   Update the revocation status information.   Notify relying parties and urge them to update revocation information.   If the impersonated subject is not yet aware, inform the subject.   Notify competent authorities about the breach.  6.2.7 Responding to a personal data breach  The objective in the response to a personal data breach is to minimize the disclosure of personal  information. However, depending on the nature of the breach, this will not always be possible for  the TSP. At least, the following actions are recommended:  Mitigating the impact of security incidents  Guidelines for trust services providers – Part 3  Version 1.0 – December 2013  Page  21   Determine if the incident is on-going and take contention measures. For example, in the  case of a hacked system, disable the system until the vulnerabilities facilitating the incident  have been found and corrective actions taken.   Notify competent authorities about the breach.   Inform affected entities regarding which personal information has been compromised and  what is the extent of the disclosure.  6.2.8 Responding to a compromise of a subject’s key pair  A compromise in a subject key pair implies as an immediate action the revocation of the affected  certificate. If the compromise may affect other subjects, for example when it derives from  vulnerabilities in the subject device, further actions may be needed. At least, the following actions  are recommended:   Revoke the affected certificate(s).   Update the revocation status service.   If the certificate subject is not yet aware, inform the subject.   Notify competent authorities about the breach.   Issue new certificate for the subject(s).  In case the compromise affects other subjects, for example when it derives from vulnerabilities in  the subject key pair algorithm, At least the following additional actions are recommended:   Determine the common cause.   Determine all affected subjects  6.2.9 Responding to a loss of availability of services  The goal in the response to a loss of availability is to minimize the downtime of the service and the  impact on the trust service.   Activate contingency plans and business continuity plans (such as standby systems).   If the disruption affects revocation status information systems, notify relying parties and  urge them not to accept any certificates until revocation information is available to prevent  the use of revoked certificates.  Mitigating the impact of security incidents  Guidelines for trust services providers – Part 3  Version 1.0 – December 2013  Page  22  7 Eradicating and resolving the incident  Once the source of the compromise has been determined and the appropriate response actions to  mitigate the impact of the incident have been taken, the TSP should take the appropriate measures  to minimize the possibility of the incident occurring again. The measures the TSP should take  include:  7.1 Determine what facilitated the incident  Assess whether the incident was the consequence of vulnerabilities in any of the systems or  processes of the TSP. Most incidents can be traced to some vulnerability. If the incident was due to a  malicious insider, an associated vulnerability can be the lack of dual controls or mandatory rotation.  In the case of a cryptographic attack, it might possible that the chosen algorithms, protocols,  parameters or implementations (SW or HW) do not match the level of assurance needed for the  provider. In any case, it is of critical importance to trace what facilitated the incident in order to be  able to eradicate it.  7.2 Analyse the existing security policies and procedures  Review the existing policies and procedures (including policy enforcement), especially those related  to systems and processes related to the incident, to determine if they are sufficient for the expected  level of security. Especially important is to assess those policies and procedures related to the exiting  vulnerabilities.  7.3 Re-conduct a risk assessment  Re-conduct a risk assessment to determine if the existing security controls match the level of risk  accepted by the organization. Based on the analysis results determine if security measures are to be  incremented. Note that this should take place regularly anyway, even if no incident occurred.  7.4 Define and implement corrective measures  If the risk assessment results determine that any security levels need to be incremented, the last  step in the eradication process is to define and implement the security measures needed.  A parallel activity important during the eradication phase is to document all the actions taken during  the incident. All this information should be used as input to improve the incident management  procedures.  Mitigating the impact of security incidents  Guidelines for trust services providers – Part 3  Version 1.0 – December 2013  Page  23  8 Learning from past incidents  Many trust service providers (TSP) have already been affected by an incident during the course of  their operations. Prevention is critical for incidents not to take place, but as the following examples  show, once the incident has occurred, the response can certainly make a difference on the impact  for the users and the provider.  8.1 CA compromises  A while after the CA compromises presented here, updates of the OCSP standard (RFC 2560 [24] to  RFC 6960 [25]) and the CA/B Forum Guidelines9 (version 1.0.3 to version 1.0.4) have been issued, to  address OCSP responses for non-issued certificates.  DigiNotar  One of the most widely known examples of breach in a TSP which illustrates a CA compromise is the  DigiNotar case10. DigiNotar was a Dutch TSP operating from 1997 until 2011. DigiNotar provided two  types of certificates. Certificates from their own root CA: \"DigiNotar Root CA”, and certificates as an  intermediary of the Dutch Government root CA: \"Staat der Nederlanden\".  In July 2011, a fraudulent SSL certificate for Google domains was generated by an attacker who  gained access to DigiNotar’s internal systems. In the following weeks, at least 531 fake certificates  were issued for popular Internet domains.  DigiNotar failed to react to the breach in due time, making it possible for the attacker to launch man- in-the-middle attacks and eavesdrop on private communications. DigiNotar became aware of an  intrusion on July 19th 2011; however they didn’t publically admit the breach until end of August  2011. Common Internet browsers started to remove DigiNotar from their trusted certificates list as  they became aware of the possible fraudulent use.  An investigation was launched by the Dutch government on the incident. Although it was not clear  whether the other CA, the one issuing certificates for the Dutch government systems, had been  compromised, they decided to revoke all certificates on September 3rd 2011, making it impossible  for many Dutch citizens (those who had obtained their certificates through DigiNotar) to access  eGovernment platforms.  All these events and the failure to response diligently to the incident lead to DigiNotar going into  bankruptcy. Furthermore, it is difficult to estimate how many entities were subject to an intrusion in  their private communications by the use of fraudulent certificates.  The elapsed time frame between the detection and the public admission of the breach was more  than one month, effectively giving the attacker an extended amount of time to perform fraudulent  operations. The lack of a prompt response and the inability to clearly establish the impact of the  incident lead to a loss of trust in DigiNotar that eventually caused the end of the company.  Globalsign  On similar dates to the compromise of DigiNotar, the same hacker who intruded DigiNotar claimed  to have intruded Globalsign11. Globalsign conducted a throughout investigation by an external party  9  https://www.cabforum.org/  10  http://threatpost.com/final-report-diginotar-hack-shows-total-compromise-ca-servers-103112  11  http://www.theregister.co.uk/2011/09/07/globalsign_suspends_ssl_cert_biz/  https://www.cabforum.org/ http://threatpost.com/final-report-diginotar-hack-shows-total-compromise-ca-servers-103112 http://www.theregister.co.uk/2011/09/07/globalsign_suspends_ssl_cert_biz/  Mitigating the impact of security incidents  Guidelines for trust services providers – Part 3  Version 1.0 – December 2013  Page  24  that concluded that only a peripheral web server was breached, but the intrusion never reached any  CA operation systems and no fraudulent certificate issuance activity had taken place.  Turktrust  One of the last publically known incidents affecting a CA is the Turktrust case12. Turktrust is a large  Turkish TSP. In 2011 Turktrust erroneously issued certificates meant to be subject certificates, but  that were actually intermediate CA certificates with the capability of issuing new certificates whose  validity would be attested by Turktrust. This case shows an example of a compromise of an  intermediate CA due to an erroneous issuing of CA capabilities instead of an end user certificate.  One of the receivers of the erroneous certificates reported it to Turktrust and the certificate was  revoked. However, the receiver of the other certificate, the public transport authority in Ankara, did  not report the incident.. Google discovered in December 2012 that Chrome users are presented  Google certificates which were not issued by order of Google. The investigation lead by Turktrust  determined that the second certificate was installed in a proxy server which automatically generated  certificates for visited sites to conduct security scans of the traffic. Aside from that no misuse of the  certificate had taken place.  8.2 RA compromises  Comodo  Another example illustrates a Registration Authority compromise, such as the Comodo case13. On  March 15th 2011 an affiliate Registration Authority of Comodo, a large TLS certificates provider, was  compromised and nine rogue certificates were created for common Internet domains. The attack  targeted a user account in the RA, which had the capability to issue requests for new certificates. In  this case, the compromise was not of the CA, but of the RA, which has the responsibility to validate  the identity of subjects requesting certificates.  Comodo became aware of the intrusion on March 26th 2011 and immediately revoked all fraudulent  certificates and informed all relevant stakeholders. Activity was detected in Internet for only one of  the rogue certificates.  The Comodo case shows an example of how compromising Registration Authorities can lead to  fraudulent certificates. Comodo acted promptly and was able to determine the extent of the  incident, revoking the fraudulent certificates.  8.3 Impersonation  VeriSign  Another case illustrates the example of an impersonation incident, the VeriSign case14. The VeriSign  case is one of the first publicly known compromises to have occurred in a TSP. The breach was due  to an attacker claiming to be an employee of Microsoft to whom VeriSign issued two code signing  certificates. The fraudulent certificates could be used to sign malicious code to make it appear as  signed by Microsoft, which would avoid raising any security alerts in the browser.  12  http://nakedsecurity.sophos.com/2013/01/08/the-turktrust-ssl-certificate-fiasco-what-happened-and-what- happens-next/  13  http://blogs.comodo.com/it-security/data-security/the-recent-ra-compromise/  14  http://news.cnet.com/2100-1001-254586.html  http://nakedsecurity.sophos.com/2013/01/08/the-turktrust-ssl-certificate-fiasco-what-happened-and-what-happens-next/ http://nakedsecurity.sophos.com/2013/01/08/the-turktrust-ssl-certificate-fiasco-what-happened-and-what-happens-next/ http://blogs.comodo.com/it-security/data-security/the-recent-ra-compromise/ http://news.cnet.com/2100-1001-254586.html  Mitigating the impact of security incidents  Guidelines for trust services providers – Part 3  Version 1.0 – December 2013  Page  25  The certificates were issued on January 29th and 30th January 2001, and Microsoft was informed in  March of the same year. VeriSign claimed they detected the possible fraudulent issuance on a  routine audit.  VeriSign revoked the certificates, and included them in VeriSign's current CRL. However, because  VeriSign's code-signing certificates didn’t specify a link to the CRL location, browsers could not verify  this information. Therefore Microsoft had to issue a security update in order for the browser to be  able to check the revocation status of these certificates locally.  The fraudulent certificates were not detected to have been used in the Internet. VeriSign acted  promptly revoking the certificates before they were used.  8.4 Cryptographic compromises  RSA-512  In November 2011, Fox-IT reported on several abused subject certificates15. The certificates in  question were legitimately issued 512bit RSA certificates. In addition to their legitimate usage (e.g.  for HTTPS servers), the corresponding private keys had been used to sign malware.  Presumably, attackers had successfully derived the private key from the public key contained in the  certificates, which is known to take for 512bit keys at most a couple of weeks with modern  equipment. As most of the certificates did not include any usage restrictions, it was possible to use  e.g. certificates meant for authentication for signature purposes.  At least one of the CAs (Digicert Sdn. Bhd.) did not include a link for revocation checking into its  subject certificates, which led to the revocation of the respective CA certificate to contain the  damage.  8.5 Organizational failures  RSA-1024  In summer 2013, an international research team made their success in factoring 184 real world RSA- 1024 keys public16. These keys were generated by smart cards issued by the Taiwanese government  that were certified secure by multiple important standards: FIPS certification from NIST (U.S.  government) and CSE (Canadian government), and Common Criteria certification from BSI (German  government).  The cards were erroneously delivered in non-certified mode leading to the usage of a weak random  number generator. This lead to keys sharing primes that could relatively easy be computed by bulk  greatest common divider (GCD) extractions. By further investigating the randomness-generation  failures, more keys, that did not share primes, were factored.  8.6 Lessons learned  Summarizing the paragraphs above, the main lessons learned are:   Many types of TSP compromises have already happened; partly with serious  consequences. More incidents are to be expected.  15  https://www.fox-it.com/en/blog/rsa-512-certificates-abused-in-the-wild/  16  http://smartfacts.cr.yp.to/smartfacts-20130916.pdf  https://www.fox-it.com/en/blog/rsa-512-certificates-abused-in-the-wild/ http://smartfacts.cr.yp.to/smartfacts-20130916.pdf  Mitigating the impact of security incidents  Guidelines for trust services providers – Part 3  Version 1.0 – December 2013  Page  26   Serious compromises may happen without being attacked, just by an unfortunate series  of events / human errors.   Failure of responding diligently damages both the client and the provider.   Awareness and quick and proper reaction to an incident limits the damage to both the  client and the provider.   Having proper processes, policies (including but not limited to validity periods and  updates of cryptographic modules) and their enforcement and traceability are equally  important as the technical security measures.   Strong authentication of operators is of the essence, not only for CAs but also for RAs  and other TSP authorities.   Apart from algorithms and formats, the right choice of cryptographic parameters (e.g.  key length) and additional attributes (e.g. validity period, key usage, revocation  information, …) in certificates are of the essence.   Security certifications of individual modules, even those following internationally  renowned standards, do not guarantee the security or flawlessness of the services  composed using such modules.  Mitigating the impact of security incidents  Guidelines for trust services providers – Part 3  Version 1.0 – December 2013  Page  27  9 Recommendations  This section provides the most important recommendations contained in this document in short and  general form. These recommendations target the Trust Service Providers and cover the following  areas:   Remember that security is an ongoing process that never stops   Be aware of possible incidents and attack vectors   Prepare for known and unknown incidents  o The TSP should establish, if appropriate according to local legislation and field of  use, a database of issued certificates with the contact information  o The TSP should establish a database with contact information regarding (known)  relying parties (or their representatives) that use their certificates  o The TSP should establish a database with contact information regarding supervisors  and competent authorities  o The TSP should foster a culture of self monitoring and self testing  o The TSP should define procedures for incident management  o The TSP should have an updated list of roles and responsibilities of staff in case of an  incident  o The TSP should conduct incident response exercises periodically   Have means to actually detect and assess incidents  o The TSP should establish a support line or helpdesk where any information regarding  suspicious activity can be received  o The TSP should follow security alert systems and forums and be aware of the latest  threats  o The TSP should establish an adequate level of logging in all information systems   Respond to incidents in a quick, effective, and reasonable way  o TSPs should have an incident response team  o The TSP should provide means to register any incident in a standardized format so  that incident management personnel can response more effectively  o Have (cold or hot) standby systems in place to take over the duties of the main  system in case of an incident  o TSP should be able to provide subjects with services from other providers until the  operations can be resumed   After an incident, close the gaps that made it possible   Learn from past incidents – own and others’  Mitigating the impact of security incidents  Guidelines for trust services providers – Part 3  Version 1.0 – December 2013  Page  28  Annex 1 – Definitions  Asset: any person, facility, material, information or activity that has value to the organization, its  business operations and their continuity, including Information resources that support the  organization's mission.

threats, vulnerabilities,  consequences and incident scenarios) that will identify and evaluate the risks:  o System scope delimitation: Determining the scope included in the risk assessment  and its boundaries  o Asset identification: Identifying any type of item that has value to the organization  and that could cause damage if it is involved in an incident.  o Threat analysis: identifying all agents, either natural or human made, accidental or  intentional, internal or external, that could pose a threat to the organization.  o Vulnerability analysis: Identifying all potential weakness in the organization that  could facilitate a successful attack and cause damage to the assets.  o Consequence determination: Identifying the possible consequences that different  events could have on the organization.  o Incident scenario identification: Determining the possible events that could have an  impact on the organization and that will serve as a base to identify the risks.   Risk analysis: Determining the risk level based on the impact of each incident scenario and  their probability of occurrence.   Risk evaluation: Producing a scored list of all the identified risks, based on the risk analysis  results; the business criteria; the affected assets and their vulnerabilities and the potential  threats.

    "abstract": "This document recommends measures to mitigate the impact of security incidents on trust service providers (TSP) by proposing suitable technical and organisational means to handle the security risks posed to the TSP. This is done using a certification service provider (CSP) as representative example. The document focuses on the concepts and entities of hierarchical public key infrastructures (PKI), leaving other concepts, such as web of trust, out of scope."

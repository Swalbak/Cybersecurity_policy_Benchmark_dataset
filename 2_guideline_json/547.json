As a threat landscape, this study gives a detailed overview of the current threats applicable to the  Internet infrastructure and their trends, so that Internet infrastructure owners can improve their  security using good practices.  For that purpose, this study details the assets of Internet infrastructure (structured into eight types:  hardware, software, information, human resources, protocols, services, interconnections, and  infrastructure) and list the threats applicable to these Internet infrastructure assets. These results  are structured into mind maps. The study then classifies Important Specific Threats of the Internet  infrastructure – namely Routing threats, DNS threats, Denial of Service, and Generic threats – and  links each threat with a list of assets exposed.  As a good practice guide, this study details a list of good practices that aim at securing an Internet  infrastructure asset from Important Specific Threats. A gap analysis identifies that some assets  remain not covered by current good practices: human resources (administrators and operators) for  Routing, DNS and Denial of Service, as well as System Configuration and Essential Addressing  Protocols for Denial of Service.  This study provides Internet Infrastructure owners with a guide to assess threats applicable to their  assets. It proposes recommendations to improve the security of the Internet infrastructure. These  recommendations are sorted into:  Five technical recommendations:   Recommendation 1: For Internet Infrastructure owners and electronic communications  network regulatory agencies, evaluate your current level of security by understanding the  assets covered (and not covered) by existing security measures.   Recommendation 2: For Internet infrastructure owners, evaluate the application of adapted  good practices in a focused manner.   Recommendation 3: For Internet infrastructure owners, cooperate with the community to  exchange on threats and promote the application of good practices as mitigation measures.   Recommendation 4: For users deploying good practices guides, report on their  implementations, assets covered and gaps found.   Recommendation 5: Words matter: Ensure the right use of terms and definitions.  And four organisational recommendations:   Recommendation 6: For Internet infrastructure owners, use proper risk assessment methods  to understand vulnerable assets in your Internet infrastructure and prioritise your protection  actions.   Recommendation 7: Build an information and communication technology security  awareness and training program.   Recommendation 8: Internet infrastructure owners shall commit third-party vendors to  apply security measures.   Recommendation 9: Internet infrastructure owners should stay current on any updates.

As a complex system, it largely  depends on different components, mechanisms and functions on various levels of abstraction. The  infrastructure of the Internet, as the underlying base, comprises of hardware, physical  infrastructure, interconnection, software, protocols, information, services, and human resources.  For instance, networks (autonomous systems) are connected by components of the physical layers,  but they are addressed by logical addressing schemes, carrying data via a set of protocols to the  desired destination, and operators who can leap into action when trouble occurs. A failure of those  core components does not only cause a disruption of a network or some participants, but it may also  influence a large portion of the Internet, up to its entirety.  This Threat Landscape and Good Practice Guide for Internet Infrastructure (IITL) is one of the  deliverables (Work Package 1.1 – Deliverable 2) foreseen in the ENISA Work Programme 2014 under  the Work Stream ‘Support EU policy building’.1 It provides an overview of the current state of cyber  security in this domain.  This study is intended to enhance guidance available on the security of the Internet infrastructure.  By doing so, it starts off with taking stock of assets which can be found at Internet infrastructure  operators such as Internet Service Providers (ISP), Internet Exchange Points (IXP), or other network  carriers. Based on assets identified, this study carries out a threat assessment by taking into account  the specifics of the Internet infrastructure and moreover provides a starting point to support further  risk assessments. Those threats are termed as important specific threats for the Internet  infrastructure. Assets and threats are brought together to identify the most important exposures.  Originators of threats, i.e. the threat agents, are classified, described, and mapped to the previously  identified threats. They are taken further into account in order to develop a list of existing measures  such as good practices that aim to reduce the asset’s attack surfaces. Following this, assets not  covered are identified and reasons are given for the lack of protection measures. Finally, the  experience gained during this study is joined with the feedback of the experts who were consulted  to draw a conclusion and summarise technical as well as operational recommendations to support  the protection of the Internet infrastructure and the security of networks.  This study, and notably the recommendations, have been agreed upon with experts from the ENISA  Internet Infrastructure Security and Resilience Reference Group. Due to the assessment performed  and the valuable feedback of experts, this study covers the most important building blocks of the  Internet infrastructure. However, one must be aware that such a study cannot be exhaustive, due to  dynamics of the infrastructure in at stake and the threat environment.  1.1 Policy Context  The Cyber Security Strategy for the EU2 stresses the importance of threat analysis and emerging  trends in cyber security. The ENISA Threat Landscape is an activity towards achieving objectives  formulated in this regulation, in particular by contributing to identifying emerging trends in cyber-  1  “ENISA Work Programme 2014”, http://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/programmes-reports/work- programme-2014 , in particular, p. 16.  2 http://ec.europa.eu/digital-agenda/en/news/eu-cybersecurity-plan-protect-open-internet-and-online- freedom-and-opportunity-cyber-security  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/programmes-reports/work-programme-2014 http://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/programmes-reports/work-programme-2014 http://ec.europa.eu/digital-agenda/en/news/eu-cybersecurity-plan-protect-open-internet-and-online-freedom-and-opportunity-cyber-security http://ec.europa.eu/digital-agenda/en/news/eu-cybersecurity-plan-protect-open-internet-and-online-freedom-and-opportunity-cyber-security  Threat Landscape and Good Practice Guide for Internet Infrastructure  January 2015  Page  2  threats and understanding the evolution of cyber-crime (see ENISA’s Understanding the Importance  of the Internet Infrastructure in Europe).3  Moreover, the new ENISA regulation4 mentions the necessity to analyse current and emerging risks  (and their components), stating: “the Agency, in cooperation with Member States and, as  appropriate, with statistical bodies and others, collects relevant information”. In particular, under  Art. 3, Tasks, d), iii), the new ENISA regulation states that ENISA should “enable effective responses  to current and emerging network and information security risks and threats”.  From the above-mentioned reasons, it becomes apparent that the ENISA Threat Landscape is a  significant contribution to the EU Cyber Security Strategy, streamlining and consolidating available  information on cyber-threats and their evolution.  This study aims to provide a significant contribution towards assessing the cyber threat exposure of  the Internet infrastructure. As such, it will directly contribute to the assessment of cyber security as  well as supporting investor and industry concerns.  1.2 Target Audience  This material is a tool for Internet infrastructure asset owners who, based on this study, wish to  perform detailed threat analyses and risk assessments according to their particular needs/scope (i.e.  asset protection level based on asset impact, vulnerabilities and detail of mitigation measures). In  this study the threat exposure of Internet infrastructure assets is being presented; asset owners may  deepen their threat analysis and risk assessment by using the asset and threat details provided. A  deeper analysis by the asset owners should be based on assessed threats, vulnerabilities, and impact  statements with regard to the concrete assets deployed by the Internet infrastructure operators.  Moreover, policy makers can rely on the Internet infrastructure threat landscape to understand the  current state of threats, trends and associated mitigation measures. Such threat landscape may  constitute an input to develop policy actions in the areas of cyber security, critical infrastructure  protection and Internet infrastructure in particular.  Through the significant number of reports collected, the Internet infrastructure threat landscape  provides a unique collection of information regarding cyber security threats. Hence, a further target  group of this study are individuals who would like to obtain access to these sources in order to use  them for their own purposes.  1.3 Scope of the Study  The definition of the Internet used throughout this study is similar to the definition employed by RFC  2026:5  The Internet, a loosely-organized international collaboration of autonomous, interconnected  networks, supports host-to-host communication through voluntary adherence to open protocols and  procedures defined by Internet Standards. There are also many isolated interconnected networks,  which are not connected to the global Internet but use the Internet Standards.  3 ENISA, “Understanding the Importance of the Internet Infrastructure in Europe”,  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/critical-infrastructure-and-services/inter- x/guidelines-for-enhancing-the-resilience-of-ecommunication-networks  4 http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2013:165:0041:0058:EN:PDF  5 RFC 2026, http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2026.txt  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/critical-infrastructure-and-services/inter-x/guidelines-for-enhancing-the-resilience-of-ecommunication-networks https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/critical-infrastructure-and-services/inter-x/guidelines-for-enhancing-the-resilience-of-ecommunication-networks http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2013:165:0041:0058:EN:PDF http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2026.txt  Threat Landscape and Good Practice Guide for Internet Infrastructure  January 2015  Page  3  Based on this definition, the Internet Infrastructure consists of a wide range of assets residing on  different physical and logical layers, which are crucial for its proper operation. The scope of this  study focuses on the threats applicable to these physical and logical assets, as presented in Figure 1.  Figure 1 – Focus of the Threat Landscape and Good Practice Guide for Internet Infrastructure  This study proposes a threat landscape, which is an overview of current threats applicable to the  Internet Infrastructure and their associated trends. The goal is to enhance the security of the  Internet Infrastructure by detailing a list of good practices and recommendations for important  specific threats.  1.4 Structure of this Study  The remainder of this study is organised as follows:  Chapter 2 gives insight into the methodology followed during the execution of this study.  Chapter 3 presents all relevant Internet infrastructure asset types. An overview of the assets and  their dependencies is depicted in a mind map.  Chapter 4 elaborates on the threat types that the previously defined assets are exposed to. The  developed taxonomy is presented as mind map and the most relevant threats are clustered into  important specific threat groups and their trends are indicated.  Chapter 5 deals with the exposure of the identified assets to cyber threats.  Chapter 6 introduces the threat agents and maps them in regard with the threat types.  Chapter 7 lists and summarises available Internet infrastructure security measures mitigating the  important specific threats. Assets which are not covered are identified and the reasons are outlined.  Chapter 8 builds on lessons learned during the study and summarises experiences gained in  technical and organisational recommendations.  Chapter 9 concludes.  All material that is referenced by a URL in the footnotes is available on the day of publication of this  study. It is also worth mentioning that in order to keep the size of this study manageable, detailed  material is provided by means of annexes. These shall support Internet infrastructure asset owners  to perform a risk assessment.  Telecommunication Infrastructure  (routers, cables...)

Subsequently, security measures have to be introduced to achieve assessed protection  levels by mitigating (part of) the assessed risks. Other risks might be transferred or accepted. As  discussed below, threats are an important element in risk assessment.  In this section, the methodology followed in the IITL is presented. It consists of a number of threats  to which the Internet Infrastructure assets are exposed. Hence, the presented IITL is an important  tool for those who want to assess the risks within an IT environment of any complexity. Based on  these risks, appropriate security measures can be selected to achieve risk mitigation. Identified good  practices can be used as a guideline for achieving this goal.  The role of threats in the risk assessment equations becomes evident when looking at the  components of risks. According to the widely accepted ISO 27005 definition, risks emerge when:  “Threats abuse vulnerabilities of assets to generate harm for the organization”. In more detailed  terms, the risk is considered as taking into account the following elements:  Asset (Vulnerabilities, Controls), Threat (Threat Agent Profile, Likelihood) and Impact  This study does not assume the use of any particular Internet or network infrastructure equipment  or the operational processes or services. As such, it is impossible to make any valid assumptions  about impact and vulnerabilities of assets. These are activities that can solely be performed by the  asset owner. Hence, the need for supporting tools for the performance of risk assessments becomes  obvious and essential for the asset owner in this complex environment.  The elements of risks are graphically depicted in Figure 2 below:  Figure 2– Threats targeting an asset by trying to exploit its vulnerabilities  This figure has been adopted from ISO 13335-4 and shows how threat agents (cf. Chapter 6),  deploying threats (T), try to exploit asset vulnerabilities (V) in order to harm/take over the asset. The  asset owner has implemented security measures (M) to protect the asset, that is, to eliminate or  significantly reduce its vulnerabilities. The impact achieved by the potential materialization of a  threat is the final element to evaluate the risk of an asset (see also risk definition above).  6 “ENISA Threat Landscape 2013”, https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/risk-management/evolving-threat- environment/enisa-threat-landscape-2013-overview-of-current-and-emerging-cyber-threats  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/risk-management/evolving-threat-environment/enisa-threat-landscape-2013-overview-of-current-and-emerging-cyber-threats https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/risk-management/evolving-threat-environment/enisa-threat-landscape-2013-overview-of-current-and-emerging-cyber-threats  Threat Landscape and Good Practice Guide for Internet Infrastructure  January 2015  Page  5  3 Internet Infrastructure Assets  According to ENISA’s Guideline on Threats and Assets7 published in the context of ENISA’s Security  framework for Article 4 and 13a8 proposal, an asset is defined as “… anything of value. Assets can be  abstract assets (like processes or reputation), virtual assets (for instance, data), physical assets  (cables, a piece of equipment), human resources, money”. Nevertheless, for information security  considerations this study focuses on assets that are mainly related to information and  communication technology (ICT) under the scope of the Internet infrastructure.  Assets of the Internet infrastructure ensure the connectivity of networks from a physical and logical  point of view. An asset taxonomy is presented to structure all relevant assets, illustrated in Figure 3.  Due to the complexity of the Internet infrastructure the assets are grouped into asset types of  different granularity and scope. For instance, the operation of a router requires the hardware which  can be found at a physical location, a configuration, software that instantiates the configuration,  essential addressing services for interconnection defined by a set of protocols, and an operator to  monitor its current state. Hence, the granularity of asset types, even if they are arranged on the  same level of the taxonomy, may vary. In addition to the ICT assets, several non-IT assets are  identified. They strongly depend on ICT and are central for the proper operation of the Internet. For  instance, buildings, power supply, cooling systems, or human resources. A detailed description of  these assets is given in Annex A.  Figure 3 – Assets of the Internet infrastructure (levels 1 and 2 - see Annex B for the expanded mind map)  The mind map presented in Figure 3 gives an overview of all assets determined and is structured into  asset types according to their use. However, an asset is not necessarily an exclusive member of just  one asset type. For readability, the details of the mind map are limited to the secondary level. An  expanded version is presented in Annex B. In the following the asset types are presented for the first  level of the mind map:  7 https://resilience.enisa.europa.eu/article-13/guideline_on_threats_and_assets/guideline-on-threats-and- assets/at_download/file  8 http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/Incidents-reporting/proposal-for-one-security- framework-for-articles-4-and-13a/at_download/fullReport  Human resources  Auditors  End users  Trainers  Managers  Developers  Support teams  Administrators  Operators  Infrastructure  Physical security  Cooling systems  Power supply  Buildings  Cabling and linking  Interconnection Generic Internet provider  Internet exchange point  Services  Security  Applications  Routing  Essential addressing  Information  Lawful interception  User rights policies  Credentials  Operational information  Inventory of hardware, software, infrastructure, configuration  Historical information/statistics  Trending information  Network topology  System configuration  Software  Executable programs  Firmwares  Device drivers  Operating systems  Hardware  Personnel terminals  Servers  Network devices  Protocols  Security protocols  Application protocols  Connectivity protocols  Routing protocols  Essential addressing protocols  Internet Infrastructure Assets  https://resilience.enisa.europa.eu/article-13/guideline_on_threats_and_assets/guideline-on-threats-and-assets/at_download/file https://resilience.enisa.europa.eu/article-13/guideline_on_threats_and_assets/guideline-on-threats-and-assets/at_download/file http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/Incidents-reporting/proposal-for-one-security-framework-for-articles-4-and-13a/at_download/fullReport http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/Incidents-reporting/proposal-for-one-security-framework-for-articles-4-and-13a/at_download/fullReport  Threat Landscape and Good Practice Guide for Internet Infrastructure  January 2015  Page  6  The asset types hardware, software, information, and human resources comprise the same assets  as in former studies7 10 and can be thought of as intuitively clear. Moreover, the following are  particularly applicable to the Internet infrastructure:   A protocol is a set of digital rules for data exchange within or between computer systems.  Protocols are valuable assets for the Internet infrastructure because they allow meaningful  communication between different computer systems.   A service, with regards to the Internet infrastructure, refers to an abstract combination of  other functionalities utilizing other assets in order to fulfil a defined task. Services are  important, as the Internet is built around services.   Interconnection covers the organisations building and running large computer networks. As  the Internet is a network of different large computer networks, the assets providing  interconnection functionality are very valuable.   The term infrastructure denotes the basic physical structures and facilities (e.g., buildings  and cables) needed for the operation of the Internet. In order to build a worldwide network  of networks, the so-called Internet, the supporting infrastructure is crucial.  The asset taxonomy presented should only be considered as a snapshot of the complex range of  Internet assets and can as such not be exhaustive.  Threat Landscape and Good Practice Guide for Internet Infrastructure  January 2015  Page  7  4 Threats of the Internet Infrastructure  4.1 Threat types  According to the ENISA Glossary,9 a threat is “any circumstance or event with the potential to  adversely impact an asset through unauthorized access, destruction, disclosure, modification of data,  and/or denial of service”.  Based on the identified assets within the previous chapter a taxonomy of relevant threats impeding  the Internet infrastructure or at least significant parts is developed.  Since this study focuses on information security, the threat taxonomy presented mainly covers cyber  security threats. However, for faultless operation, physical assets are also required and therefore  several specific non-IT threats are assumed. The identified threats are a consolidation of the  publications ENISA Threat Landscape 2013,6 the Smart Grid Threat Landscape and Good Practice  Guide,10 the Security Framework for Article 4 and 13a proposal,11 and ENISA’s Guideline on Threats  and Assets.12 Consecutively, the first level of the threat taxonomy is presented and some instances  of associated threats are provided.  The threats have been regrouped under threat types, each threat type representing the source  cause of a threat. They are the following:   Physical attacks are intentional offensive actions which aim to destroy, expose, alter,  disable, steal or gain unauthorised access to physical assets such as infrastructure,  hardware, or interconnection. This threat type basically applies to any kind of infrastructure  in general, thus also to the Internet infrastructure. Instances, among others, are vandalism,  theft, sabotage, information leakage, and bomb attacks.   A disaster is a serious disruption of the functioning of a society and can be divided into  natural disasters not directly triggered by humans, and environmental disasters directly  caused by human. Those threats apply to any kind of asset in general, hence also to the  Internet infrastructure. Typical threats of this class are earthquakes, floods, wildfires and  pollution, dust, or corrosion.   The condition of not or insufficient functioning of any Internet infrastructure asset is defined  as failure or malfunction. For example, failures or disruptions of network devices or  systems, software bugs, or configuration errors.   Outages are unexpected disruptions of service or decrease in quality falling below a required  level. This includes all kinds of assets, even human resources. Outages may have many  reasons, including, but not limited to, lack of resources, exhaustions, power surges, or  human factors like absence of personnel.  9 ENISA Glossary, https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/risk-management/current-risk/risk-management- inventory/glossary  10 ENISA, “Smart Grid Threat Landscape”, https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/risk-management/evolving- threat-environment/sgtl/smart-grid-threat-landscape-and-good-practice-guide  11 ENISA, “Security Framework for Article 4 and 13a proposal”,  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/Incidents-reporting/proposal-for-one-security- framework-for-articles-4-and-13a  12 https://resilience.enisa.europa.eu/article-13/guideline_on_threats_and_assets/guideline-on-threats-and- assets/at_download/file  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/risk-management/current-risk/risk-management-inventory/glossary https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/risk-management/current-risk/risk-management-inventory/glossary https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/risk-management/evolving-threat-environment/sgtl/smart-grid-threat-landscape-and-good-practice-guide https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/risk-management/evolving-threat-environment/sgtl/smart-grid-threat-landscape-and-good-practice-guide http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/Incidents-reporting/proposal-for-one-security-framework-for-articles-4-and-13a http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/Incidents-reporting/proposal-for-one-security-framework-for-articles-4-and-13a https://resilience.enisa.europa.eu/article-13/guideline_on_threats_and_assets/guideline-on-threats-and-assets/at_download/file https://resilience.enisa.europa.eu/article-13/guideline_on_threats_and_assets/guideline-on-threats-and-assets/at_download/file  Threat Landscape and Good Practice Guide for Internet Infrastructure  January 2015  Page  8   Unintentional damage refer to destruction, harm, or injury to property or persons by  accident. Damage includes physical damage as well as information leakage, system  alterations, inadequate designs, or lack of adaptation.   Damage refers to destruction, harm, or injury of property or persons and results in a failure  or reduction in usefulness. The concrete threats are similar to the unintentional damage but  primarily focus on IT assets and imply intention. Important representatives are such threats  as loss of information, loss of reputation, and loss of hardware.   Nefarious activities and abuse are intended actions that target ICT systems, infrastructure,  and/or networks by means of malicious acts with the aim to either steal, alter, or destroy a  specified target. This class of the taxonomy arranges common threats generally referred to  as cyber attacks and related actions such as spam, malware, hardware and software  manipulation, distributed denial of service (DDoS), unauthorised usage, social engineering,  or exploitation of software bugs.   Eavesdropping/Interception/Hijacking refers to a class of actions aiming to listen, interrupt,  or seize control of a third party communication without consent.   Legal threats can be envisaged, intended, or on-going legal actions of third parties  (contracting or otherwise), in order to prohibit actions or compensate for loss based on  applicable law. Such legal threats include violation of laws, court orders, and failure to meet  contractual requirements that are carried out by or are attributed to service providers of  service beneficiaries of the network infrastructure.

However, they are subject to changes in the event of new developments and should  be considered as living documents reflecting dynamic changes in the cyber threat environment.  Threat Landscape and Good Practice Guide for Internet Infrastructure  January 2015  Page  10  4.2 Important Specific Threats of the Internet Infrastructure  In this chapter, threats specific to the Internet infrastructure are identified. As stated previously, the  Internet is the backbone of our modern information society and thus vulnerabilities within this  crucial infrastructure are not limited to single companies or some end-users, but may put a  significant portion of the Internet at danger. This threatens the daily life of thousands of users. The  previously developed threat taxonomy (cf. Chapter 4) includes several threats applicable to  information and telecommunication technology in general, hence also to be considered for the  Internet infrastructure. However, to take the scope of this study into account, the consideration of  solely Internet Infrastructure threats is advisable for a deeper analysis. It admits a deeper  understanding of threat details and allows concentration on the protection of relevant assets during  the stock taking of the good practices in Chapter 7 below.  To identify important specific threats this study takes stock of authoritative threat reports. The  material analysed has been published by private and public institutions and communities.13 14 15 16  For each threat the importance according to frequency of appearance, giving an estimation if no  valid data could be found, and expert's judgments is evaluated. The list developed was reviewed  during interviews with experts in the field and ENISA's Internet Infrastructure Security and Resilience  Reference Group.17  The conclusive listing is clustered into threat groups according to the exposed assets. Each threat  group regroups the threats menacing a particular technical domain and/or technology, with no  discrimination in regard with their threat type. The main threat groups are routing threats, DNS  threats, DDoS threats, and generic threats which are not specific to the Internet infrastructure as  denoted above. Thus, threats and threat groups presented within this section reflect the current  state-of-play but are not, and will never be exhaustive. However, one can argue that the given set of  threats still have strong relevance and should be considered within risk assessments conducted by  asset owners.  Subsequently, threat groups and their threats are presented. For each threat group the related  threat type in the presented taxonomy is referred to, followed by a description of all subordinate  specific important threats. The level of detail is limited to a certain extent to maintain readability. In  order to illustrate the importance of the threat, it is supplemented with an example of a recent  incident. Note that the list is not prioritised, but trends for the threat groups are provided so that  asset owners can evaluate their priorities after a risk assessment.  4.2.1 Routing Threats  Routing is subject to attacks that can harm the interconnection of networks as well as the operation  of single networks. A smooth operation of routing infrastructure is crucial for the robustness of the  13 Verizon, “2014 Data Breach Investigations Report”, 2014,  http://www.verizonenterprise.com/DBIR/2014/reports/rp_dbir-2014-executive-summary_en_xg.pdf  14 “Cloud Computing Top Threats in 2013”, Cloud Security Alliance, 2013,  https://downloads.cloudsecurityalliance.org/initiatives/top_threats/The_Notorious_Nine_Cloud_Computing_T op_Threats_in_2013.pdf  15 “IBM Security Services Cyber Security Intelligence Index”, IBM, 2013, https://www- 935.ibm.com/services/multimedia/Cyber_security_Index.pdf  16 “BSI Threats Catalogue”, Federal Office for Information Security, 2012,  https://www.bsi.bund.de/SharedDocs/Downloads/EN/BSI/Grundschutz/download/threats_catalogue.pdf?__b lob=publicationFile  17 https://resilience.enisa.europa.eu/internet-infrastructure-security-and-resilience-reference-group  http://www.verizonenterprise.com/DBIR/2014/reports/rp_dbir-2014-executive-summary_en_xg.pdf https://downloads.cloudsecurityalliance.org/initiatives/top_threats/The_Notorious_Nine_Cloud_Computing_Top_Threats_in_2013.pdf https://downloads.cloudsecurityalliance.org/initiatives/top_threats/The_Notorious_Nine_Cloud_Computing_Top_Threats_in_2013.pdf https://www-935.ibm.com/services/multimedia/Cyber_security_Index.pdf https://www-935.ibm.com/services/multimedia/Cyber_security_Index.pdf https://www.bsi.bund.de/SharedDocs/Downloads/EN/BSI/Grundschutz/download/threats_catalogue.pdf?__blob=publicationFile https://www.bsi.bund.de/SharedDocs/Downloads/EN/BSI/Grundschutz/download/threats_catalogue.pdf?__blob=publicationFile https://resilience.enisa.europa.eu/internet-infrastructure-security-and-resilience-reference-group  Threat Landscape and Good Practice Guide for Internet Infrastructure  January 2015  Page  11  Internet. Most threats break down routing functions by hijacking, misusing, misconfiguring, or  intercepting assigned numbers, addresses, or name spaces. The current trend indicates that this  threat is on the rise.  Nefarious Activity/Abuse Eavesdropping/Interception/ Hijacking  Autonomous  System (AS)  hijacking  Address space  hijacking  (IP prefixes)  Route leaks BGP session  hijacking  Table 1 – Application of Important Specific Threat to routing  Table 1 highlights the application of important specific threats to the routing infrastructure, for Tier  1 networks, Tier 2 ISPs and IXPs, Tier 3 ISPs and final users. The extent of a threat is represented by a  coloured bar, which denotes how the threat applies to the layers pictured on the left-hand side  schema. Routing threats apply to all layers of the Internet Infrastructure.  These important specific threats are now detailed and their trends are presented.  Threat Type: Nefarious Activity/Abuse  Trend: Increasing 6  Threat: Autonomous System (AS) hijacking  AS hijacking attacks aim at impersonating a victim’s organization. The motivation behind this type of  attack is malicious: activities conducted with the hijacked network are masked and appear to be  carried out on the behalf of the victim itself. Such attacks are characterised by an attacker  announcing the victim’s prefixes that originate at the victim’s AS.18  Example:   A forensic case study on AS hijacking: the attacker’s perspective18  Threat: Address space hijacking (IP prefixes)  This threat occurs when a rogue BGP peer maliciously announces a victim's prefixes in an effort to  reroute some or all traffic through its own networks for untoward purposes (for example, to view  contents of traffic that the router would otherwise not be able to read).19 20 21  Examples:   Hacker redirects traffic from 19 Internet providers to steal bitcoins22   Hijack by AS4761 – Indosat, a quick report23  18 “A Forensic Case Study on AS Hijacking: The Attacker’s Perspective”,  http://www.sigcomm.org/sites/default/files/ccr/papers/2013/April/2479957-2479959.pdf  19 “Protecting Border Gateway Protocol for the Enterprise”,  http://www.cisco.com/web/about/security/intelligence/protecting_bgp.html  20 “Beware of BGP Attacks”, http://www.cc.gatech.edu/~dovrolis/Papers/ccr-bgp.pdf  21 “Threat Model for BGP Path Security”, http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7132  22 http://www.secureworks.com/cyber-threat-intelligence/threats/bgp-hijacking-for-cryptocurrency-profit  Tier 1 network  Tier 2 ISPs IXPs Tier 2 ISPs  Tier 3 ISPs Tier 3 ISPs Tier 3 ISPs  Internet users  (businesses, consumers)  http://www.sigcomm.org/sites/default/files/ccr/papers/2013/April/2479957-2479959.pdf http://www.cisco.com/web/about/security/intelligence/protecting_bgp.html http://www.cc.gatech.edu/~dovrolis/Papers/ccr-bgp.pdf http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7132 http://www.secureworks.com/cyber-threat-intelligence/threats/bgp-hijacking-for-cryptocurrency-profit/  Threat Landscape and Good Practice Guide for Internet Infrastructure  January 2015  Page  12   The new threat: targeted Internet traffic misdirection24   Looking at the Spamhaus DDoS from a BGP perspective25   Pakistan hijacks YouTube26  Threat Type: Eavesdropping/Interception/Hijacking Trend: Increasing 6  Threat: Route leaks  A route leak is said to occur when AS A advertises BGP routes that it has received from AS B to its  neighbors, but AS A is not viewed as a transit provider for the announced prefixes.27  Examples:   Hijack by AS4761 – Indosat, a quick report23   How the Internet in Australia went down under28   Large route leaks29  Threat: BGP session hijacking  BGP session hijacking denotes an alteration of the contents of the BGP routing table by a malicious  device, which can, among other impacts, prevent traffic from reaching the intended destination  without acknowledgement or notification.30 31 32  Example:   Short-Lived BGP Session Hijacking33   Measuring and Analyzing on Effection of BGP Session Hijack Attack34  4.2.2 DNS Threats  The DNS system is exposed to threats that aim to bring down a central feature which allows  convenient web browsing for non-technical users and enables flexible addressing for automated  systems. Without the resolution of domain names into IP addresses the Internet is inaccessible for  the general public. Attacks attempt to alter DNS records to redirect traffic, interrupt operation, or  introduce censorship. The latest trends show a decrease for this sort of threat. However, this does  not diminish its importance.  23 http://www.bgpmon.net/hijack-by-as4761-indosat-a-quick-report  24 http://www.renesys.com/2013/11/mitm-internet-hijacking/  25 http://www.bgpmon.net/looking-at-the-spamhouse-ddos-from-a-bgp-perspective/  26 http://www.renesys.com/2008/02/pakistan-hijacks-youtube-1/  27 “Threat Model for BGP Path Security”, http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7132  28 http://www.bgpmon.net/how-the-internet-in-australia-went-down-under/  29 http://nrl.cs.arizona.edu/projects/lsrl-events-from-2003-to-2009/  30 “Protecting Border Gateway Protocol for the Enterprise”,  http://www.cisco.com/web/about/security/intelligence/protecting_bgp.html  31 “Beware of BGP Attacks”, http://www.cc.gatech.edu/~dovrolis/Papers/ccr-bgp.pdf  32 “Threat Model for BGP Path Security”: http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7132  33 https://www.usenix.org/publications/login/december-2006-volume-31-number-6/homeless-vikings-short- lived-bgp-session-hijacki  34 “Measuring and Analyzing on Effection of BGP Session Hijack Attack”, http://www.wseas.us/e- library/conferences/2013/Rhodes/CIRCOM/CIRCOM-13.pdf  http://www.bgpmon.net/hijack-by-as4761-indosat-a-quick-report http://www.renesys.com/2013/11/mitm-internet-hijacking/ http://www.bgpmon.net/looking-at-the-spamhouse-ddos-from-a-bgp-perspective/ http://www.renesys.com/2008/02/pakistan-hijacks-youtube-1/ http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7132 http://www.bgpmon.net/how-the-internet-in-australia-went-down-under/ http://nrl.cs.arizona.edu/projects/lsrl-events-from-2003-to-2009/ http://www.cisco.com/web/about/security/intelligence/protecting_bgp.html http://www.cc.gatech.edu/~dovrolis/Papers/ccr-bgp.pdf http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7132 https://www.usenix.org/publications/login/december-2006-volume-31-number-6/homeless-vikings-short-lived-bgp-session-hijacki https://www.usenix.org/publications/login/december-2006-volume-31-number-6/homeless-vikings-short-lived-bgp-session-hijacki http://www.wseas.us/e-library/conferences/2013/Rhodes/CIRCOM/CIRCOM-13.pdf http://www.wseas.us/e-library/conferences/2013/Rhodes/CIRCOM/CIRCOM-13.pdf  Threat Landscape and Good Practice Guide for Internet Infrastructure  January 2015  Page  13  Nefarious Activity/Abuse  DNS registrar  hijacking  DNS spoofing DNS poisoning Domain name  collision  Table 2 – Application of Important Specific Threat to DNS  Table 2 highlights the application of important specific threats to the DNS infrastructure. The DNS  infrastructure is represented by an abstract (simplified) tree, which shows a combination of several  typical layers. The extent of a threat is represented by a coloured bar, which denotes how the threat  applies to the layers pictured on the left-hand side schema. Important specific threats for DNS apply  to different extents to the Internet Infrastructure.  These important specific threats are now detailed and their trends are presented.  Threat Type: Nefarious Activity/Abuse  Trend: Decreasing 6  Threat: DNS registrar hijacking  If a DNS registrar is hijacked, all domains under its control are in jeopardy: the domain registration  information can be altered, which might result in a transfer of the domain to another registrar or  result in a type of identity theft. Once this has been done, the hijacker has full control of all the  domains and can use them or sell them to a third party.35  Example:   Popular registrar Namecheap fixes DNS hijack bug36  Threat: DNS spoofing  DNS spoofing refers to the broad category of attacks that spoof DNS records. There are many  different ways to do DNS spoofing: compromise a DNS server, mount a DNS cache poisoning attack,  mount a man-in-the-middle attack, guess a sequence number, and many more.  Example:   Subverting BIND’s SRTT algorithm derandomizing NS selection37  Threat: DNS poisoning  DNS (cache) poisoning is an attack technique that allows an attacker to introduce forged DNS  information into the cache of a caching domain name server. There are published articles that  describe a number of inherent deficiencies in the DNS protocol and defects in common DNS  implementations that facilitate DNS cache poisoning.38  Examples:   Abusing anti-DDoS mechanisms to perform DNS cache poisoning39   Fragmentation considered poisonous40  35 “Popular Registrar Namecheap Fixes DNS Hijack Bug”, http://threatpost.com/popular-registrar-namecheap- fixes-dns-hijack-bug  36 http://threatpost.com/popular-registrar-namecheap-fixes-dns-hijack-bug  37 https://www.usenix.org/conference/woot13/workshop-program/presentation/hay  38 “Multiple DNS implementations vulnerable to cache poisoning”, http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/800113  39 http://www.ssi.gouv.fr/en/the-anssi/publications-109/scientific-publications/conference/abusing-anti-ddos- mechanisms-to-perform-dns-cache-poisoning.html  http://threatpost.com/popular-registrar-namecheap-fixes-dns-hijack-bug http://threatpost.com/popular-registrar-namecheap-fixes-dns-hijack-bug http://threatpost.com/popular-registrar-namecheap-fixes-dns-hijack-bug https://www.usenix.org/conference/woot13/workshop-program/presentation/hay http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/800113 http://www.ssi.gouv.fr/en/the-anssi/publications-109/scientific-publications/conference/abusing-anti-ddos-mechanisms-to-perform-dns-cache-poisoning.html http://www.ssi.gouv.fr/en/the-anssi/publications-109/scientific-publications/conference/abusing-anti-ddos-mechanisms-to-perform-dns-cache-poisoning.html  Threat Landscape and Good Practice Guide for Internet Infrastructure  January 2015  Page  14  Threat: Domain name collision  A name collision refers to an attempt to resolve a name that is utilised in a private name space (e.g.  non-delegated Top Level Domain, or a short, unqualified name), resulting in a DNS query to the  public DNS, and a matching name can be retrieved. In most cases, the cause is a misconfiguration  and disregards ICANN recommendations. Name collision occurrences are not new and have  historically been observed and reported as queries containing non-delegated TLDs at the root level  of the DNS. They have received renewed attention because many applied for new TLD strings that  are identical to name space labels used in private networks.41  Examples:   Looking at corp.com as a proxy for .corp42   Reports for alternate path to delegation published43  4.2.3 Denial of Service (DoS/Distributed DoS (DDoS)) Threats  Denial of service attacks endeavour to make a computer system or network unavailable to its  intended users. Basically, every single system can be targeted by DoS ranging from a simple home  computer to a major web server farm. There are several different approaches which amplify the  intensity of an attack. Especially this kind of attack is increasing these days.  Nefarious Activity/Abuse  DDoS  amplification /reflection  DoS  flooding  DoS protocol  exploitation  DoS  malformed  packet attack  DoS  application  attack  Table 3 – Application of Important Specific Threat to Denial of Service  Table 3 highlights the application of important specific threats regarding Denial of Service. The  Internet architecture shown in the picture is simplified and abstracted in order to show the  important parts in regard to DoS. The extent of a threat is represented by a coloured bar, which  denotes how the threat applies to the layers pictured on the left-hand side schema. Important  specific threats for DoS apply to different extents to the Internet Infrastructure.  These important specific threats are now detailed and their trends are presented.  Threat Type: Nefarious Activity/Abuse Trend: Increasing 6  Threat: DDoS amplification/reflection  In a reflection DDoS attack, the attacker spoofs the victim’s IP address and sends a request for  information via UDP to servers known to respond to that type of request. The servers answer the  request and send the response to the victim’s IP address. All data from those servers adds up to  40 http://arxiv.org/abs/1205.4011  41 “Name Collision in the DNS”, https://www.icann.org/en/system/files/files/name-collision-02aug13-en.pdf  42 http://namecollisions.net/downloads/wpnc14_slides_strutt_looking_at_corpcom.pdf  43 http://newgtlds.icann.org/en/announcements-and-media/announcement-2-17nov13-en  Internet  http://www.icann.org/en/groups/ssac/documents/sac-045-en.pdf http://www.icann.org/en/groups/ssac/documents/sac-045-en.pdf http://arxiv.org/abs/1205.4011 https://www.icann.org/en/system/files/files/name-collision-02aug13-en.pdf http://namecollisions.net/downloads/wpnc14_slides_strutt_looking_at_corpcom.pdf http://newgtlds.icann.org/en/announcements-and-media/announcement-2-17nov13-en  Threat Landscape and Good Practice Guide for Internet Infrastructure  January 2015  Page  15  significant bandwidth, enough to congest the target’s Internet connectivity. With bandwidth maxed  out, normal traffic cannot be serviced and legitimate clients cannot connect.44  Examples:   The technical details behind a 400 Gbps NTP amplification DDoS attack45   Deep inside a DNS amplification DDoS attack46   The DDoS that knocked Spamhaus offline (and how we mitigated it)47  Threat: DoS flooding  A flood is a simple denial-of-service attack where the attacker overwhelms the victim with packets  (e.g. ICMP ping packets). It is most successful if the attacker has more bandwidth than the victim (for  instance, an attacker with a DSL line and the victim on a dial-up modem). The attacker may hope  that the victim will respond to its packets (e.g. ICMP echo reply packets), thus consuming both  outgoing bandwidth as well as incoming bandwidth.  Examples:   Low Orbit Ion Canon48   Anonymous Declares Cyber War on Israel, Downs Mossad Site, Many Others49  Threat: DoS protocol exploitation  Protocol exploitation (e.g. TCP-SYN) is a form of denial-of-service attack in which an attacker sends a  succession of requests to a target's system in an attempt to consume enough server resources (e.g.  TCP ports) to make the system unresponsive to legitimate traffic.  Examples:   DDoS attacks exploiting vulnerability in network time protocol, call the doctor50   Sloworis DoS attack, aka “Slow and low”51  Threat: DoS malformed packet attack  Attacks designed to crash an operation system’s network stack by providing malformed header  information or payload. 52  Examples:   Massive 300 Gbps DDoS Attack on Media Firm Fuelled by Unpatched Server Flaw53   Vulnerability in ICMPv6 could allow Denial of Service54  Threat: DoS application attack  Known application logic limitations, flaws and vulnerabilities are exploited, resulting in a specific  application failure or data corruption.

It is a summary of important threats rather than  a complete list and should raise awareness that even very common attacks may harm the Internet  infrastructure.  Threat Type: Physical attack  Trend: Not available  A physical attack can constitute a threat to an organization, certain areas of the organization or  individuals. The technical possibilities to perpetrate an attack are numerous: throwing bricks, blasts  by explosives, use of firearms or arson.57  Threat Type: Damage/Loss  Trend: Increasing 6  Any incident where a) an asset (e.g. sea-cable, device, information) is damaged by accident or in bad  faith or b) an asset (e.g. storage media, documents) goes missing, whether through misplacement or  malice.13  Threat Type: Failures/Malfunctions  Trend: Increasing 58  Threat: Failure of devices or systems  Due to dependencies of technical infrastructure, single failures of individual components, such as air- conditioning or power supply facilities, may contribute to the failure of a device or even the entire  system. In particular, key components of an IT system (for example, servers and network coupling  elements) are likely to cause such failures.59  Threat: Configuration errors  Configuration error attacks exploit configuration weaknesses found in software. Software may come  with unnecessary and unsafe features, such as debug and QA features, enabled by default. These  features may provide a means for an attacker to bypass authentication methods and gain access to  sensitive information, perhaps with elevated privileges. Likewise, default installations may include  well-known usernames and passwords, hard-coded backdoor accounts, special access mechanisms,  and incorrect permissions set for files accessible through web servers. Default samples may be  accessible in production environments. Configuration files that are not properly locked down may  reveal clear text connection strings to the database, and default settings in configuration files may  not have been set with security in mind.

It encompasses, among others, viruses, worms, trojans, rootkits, botnets,  spyware, scareware, or rogueware.61 62  Threat: Brute force  Brute force attacks are often used to defeat a cryptographic scheme, such as those secured by  passwords. Hackers use computer programs to try a very large number of passwords to decrypt the  message or access the system.63  Threat: Social engineering  Social engineering is the psychological manipulation of human behavior to breach security without  the participants (or victims) even realizing they have been manipulated. There are two main  categories under which all social engineering attempts could be classified – computer- or  technology-based deception, and human-based deception. The technology-based approach is to  deceive the user into believing he is interacting with the ‘real’ computer system and get him to  provide confidential information. The human approach is done through deception, by taking  advantage of the victim’s ignorance and the natural human inclination to be helpful and liked.64  Threat: Data breach  A data breach refers to the exfiltration of data from a system without the knowledge or consent of  its owner. This data resides in the targeted organization’s systems or networks and is proprietary or  sensitive in nature. Propriety data may be valuable or confidential in nature to an organization.  Acquisition by external parties may cause harm. This data can comprise personally identifiable  information, customer data, trade secrets and the like.65  Threat Type: Eavesdropping/Interception/Hijacking  Trend: Increasing 66  Threat: Espionage  Espionage is a process that involves human sources or technical means to obtain information that  normally is not publicly available.67  4.3 Summary of threat trends  This section sums up the trends for each threat type presented in the previous section. The general  tendency denotes an increase for the majority of threats, as presented in Table 4.  61 Y.

An increasing trend denotes a greater number of occurrence this year  compared to the previous year, even though the number of attacks can be low. An increasing trend  for this can of threats should be an incentive to monitor potential attacks in the future.  On another hand, a decreasing trend for Important Specific Threat does not diminish the importance  of this threat. In the table, DNS Threat is decreasing. Yet, the number of cyber attacks targeting DNS  remains important in relation to the total number of attacks. This decreasing trend shall only denote  a diminution of DNS as an attack vector by threat agents.

The association between  the assets from Figure 3 and the threats from Figure 4 is established for every threat type. An  interested reader can identify relevant threats based on its deployed assets. Table 5 matches a  selection of given threats with the assets types involved. Annex D proposes a more exhaustive list of  threats and their relevant assets.  The information depicted within the table are arranged as follows:   Threat types: This column states the threat types.   Threats: This field contains more detailed threats which belong to the different threat types.   Asset types: This field specifies by the threats and threat types exposed asset types.

Once  again, this study only yields a generic overview because of the lack of a concrete implementation.  For Internet infrastructure asset owners, it is crucial to be aware of which threats emerge from  which threat agent group. Table 6 presents such an overview.  However, this study does not develop a new glossary on threat agents within the IITL, but rather  utilises the ENISA Threat Landscape 2013’s consolidation of several publications.68 69 70 71 72 73 74  Interested readers may find a detailed description in ENISA’s Threat Landscape 2013.6 The  classification of threat agents is as follows:   Corporations   Hacktivists   Cyber criminals   Cyber terrorists   Script kiddies   Online social hackers   Employees   Nation states  Based on the threat agents the threats are assigned to relevant threat types (cf. Table 6). A detailed  overview covering not only the threat types is given in Annex E.

Therefore, different sources  with recommendations and good practices published by major Internet institutions or working  groups such as ICANN, IETF, RIPE, Euro-IX, and Internet Society are reviewed, summarised, and  mapped to the previously identified important specific threats. This tool enables asset owners to  carefully analyse their infrastructure and adopt appropriate good practices. The entire list inducing  all references can be found in Annex F.  A central design principle of the Internet, as a collection of networks, is shared responsibility. Every  participant should be conscious that their own security also depends on the security of neighbouring  networks. Hence, it is a collective responsibility to implement good practices when deemed useful  for their own security, and for the security of other parties when applicable. An example is  insufficiently configured DNS or NTP servers that are used by adversaries to amplify DDoS attacks.  One must be are aware of the fact that the given list is not exhaustive. However, in order to ensure a  certain level of quality, the list has been reviewed by acknowledged experts in the field and the  ENISA Internet Infrastructure Security and Resilience Reference Group.8  Table 7 contains the identified good practices and gives more details regarding the gap analysis. It  does not present good practices for “Generic Threats” which are, as their name implies, too generic  to be addressed by specific good practices. The table is structured as follows:   Important specific threat groups: A line with a grey background which contains the  important specific threat groups defined in section 4.2.   Threats: Here are the concrete threats, grouped according to the previous column, which  denote the actual threats which should be countered by applying the good practices.   Good practices: The actual good practices for the threat in the same row. The description is  a summary of different sources which are referenced in Annex F.   Assets, assets covered: All assets related to an important specific threat group are printed in  black. In the rows of the concrete threats, all assets covered by at least one measure are  printed in green.   Gap (assets not covered): This column contains the assets related to a threat which are not  covered by the associated good practice, printed in black. If an asset is not covered by at  least one good practice within the distinct threat group, this asset is printed in red to  highlight it as a gap for the threat type.

Chapter 3) endangered by a specific important threat. This gap analysis clearly outlines  existing shortcomings of this study, which are tackled by recommendations (cf. Chapter 8).  The summarised results of the gap analysis presented in Table 7 are that for most important specific  threats publicly available good practices are on hand. The gaps found for every threat group are as  follows:  Routing Threats   AS hijacking  Gap found: Administrators  Administrators are human resources responsible to define routing rules and security levels.  For instance, they define the filters applicable to BGP announcements and monitor the  status of BGP. Administrators of an Internet infrastructure are usually in direct relationship  with administrators of other (peer) networks and cooperate closely with them.  Available good practices for routing cover technical aspects related to filtering and  monitoring. However, no good practice exists today that prevents an administrator to define  rules that impact routing in a bad way, either at local or a more global scale.  Moreover, administrators ensure the security of routing by monitoring the status of their  routing system used (e.g,, BGP) and defining actions to take in case of an incident. However,  there is currently no good practice available that clearly focuses on how to handle routing  incidents between different networks. Indeed, such incidents are often resolved by  contacting other administrators on an ad-hoc basis.  This gap calls for the development of good practices that shall enhance the collaboration between  administrators, with the objective to secure routing and handle incidents.  DNS Threats   DNS Spoofing  Gap found: Administrators  Similarly to routing, administrators are responsible for DNS security. However, spoofing can  be performed when administrators fail at securing certain vulnerable assets (e.g., configure  a DNS server in a secure way) in their infrastructure. For that purpose, administrators may  need to perform an overview of their current security level and evaluate the assets to cover  with good practices.  As previously, there is a need of collaboration in the community especially as DNS is  distributed system with many different organisations involved. Indeed, spoofing can be  mitigated when administrators of Internet infrastructure exchange with their peers to  prevent, detect and overcome incidents.   DNS Poisoning  Gap found: Administrators  This gap is identical to the one found for administrator in the threat “DNS Spoofing”. The  conclusions are identical.  Threat Landscape and Good Practice Guide for Internet Infrastructure  January 2015  Page  27  Gap found: Operators  Operators of DNS infrastructures are reponsible to develop security rules that administrators  can apply to Internet infrastructure assets. However, humans are not immune to mistakes.  Moreover, the effect of certain technical security rule may differ depending on the  specificities of a given Internet infrastructure.  This gap can be mitigated by evaluating the application of good practices in the protection of  the Internet infrastructure. Operators can also report on the application of good practices to  their particular infrastructure, in order to benefit the community.   Denial of Service / Flooding  Gap found: System configuration  System configuration should ensure the application of a security policy. However, depending  on the values of certain parameters and the specificities of the Internet Infrastructure, it  may lead to different outcomes.  No good practice exists today to ensure protection against Denial of Service /  Flooding  by  defining a system configuration for a given Internet infrastructure asset.  In order to validate the good usage of system configuration and improve security, the  community can share experience on the configuration used to secure their Internet  infrastructure, by focusing on specific use cases.  Gap found: Essential addressing protocols  In the majority of Denial of Service / Flooding cases, essential addressing protocols are  spoofed when the protocol permits it (e.g., IP source addresses in UDP packets). Also, if  essential addressing protocols are not spoofed the difference from flooding and a high rate  of regular requests are difficult to tell for machines as it requires an understanding of  purpose. In that regard, no existing good practice exist to prevent this structural issue.  This gap can be covered by evaluating specific security measures to protect connected  devices. Moreover, migration toward more secured protocols can mitigate this threat to a  certain extent.  Gap found: Administrators  This gap is identical to the one found for the threat groups “Routing” and “DNS”. The  conclusions are identical.  Gap found: Operators  This gap is identical to the gap found for the threat groups “Routing” and “DNS”. The  conclusions are identical.  For every threat group, the human resources asset types are inadequately covered. This is probably  due to the technical focus of the reviewed material. Hence, it is advisable for asset owners to  consider the human factor, besides the technical good practices, in their security strategy.  Additionally, the good practices do not cover the threat flooding for the assets System configuration  and, Application protocols. This results from a more structural issue. Flooding exploits sheer data  volume to disrupt a system or service, hence misconfiguration or outdated protocols are not  necessarily a precondition. Thus, the considered good practices do not describe counter measures.  Threat Landscape and Good Practice Guide for Internet Infrastructure  January 2015  Page  28  8 Recommendations  Based on the insights gained within this study recommendations for understanding and improving  the security of the Internet infrastructure are listed in this section. Therefore, the stock taken assets  and threats are condensed to important specific threat groups of the Internet Infrastructure. On this  foundation and additional input of experts on good practices have been collected and summarised.  The following gap analysis yields a number of assets that cannot be covered by at least one good  practice. In order to provide information for the protection of not adequately covered assets, a set  of recommendations has been developed. Finally, the recommendations were reviewed by ENISA  experts and the reference group for Internet Infrastructure Security and Resilience.17  The list of recommendations is divided into technical (Section 8.1) and organisational (Section 8.2)  guidance to address particular target audiences. They may be considered by relevant stakeholders  such as standardization bodies (e.g., IETF, ICANN), industry, and academia.  One must be aware of the fact that no list of good practices and recommendations can be  exhaustive nor is it feasible to maintain a list of all possible protection measures. It is important to  raise the bar high enough to provide a baseline security at the very least.  The scope of this study is the Internet infrastructure; this study strongly advocates depending on the  core business of a company, the implementation and tailoring of the good practices for routing, DNS,  and DDoS mitigation listed in Chapter 7. Additionally, it should be kept in mind that hardware  vendors for core Internet devices such as routers or switches frequently release guidelines for their  safe and sound configuration (cf. documents mentioned in Chapter 7).  8.1 Technical Recommendations  The recommendations presented in this subsection should be considered as guidance to technical  staff such as operators or administrators. The implementation of the listed measures should be  prioritised by the results of risk assessments.  Recommendation 1: For Internet Infrastructure owners and electronic communications network  regulatory agencies, evaluate your current level of security by understanding the assets covered  (and not covered) by existing security measures.  Having a holistic view on the assets that have to be secured is the basis in making sure security  measures are applied effectively. So, the first step for each Internet infrastructure owner and  electronic communications network regulatory agency is to start with an analysis of existing (and  planned) assets in order to understand existing or potential threats.  Internet infrastructure owners should evaluate how current security measures mitigate the threats  applicable to these identified assets. In particular, they could focus on Important Specific Threats  linked to Routing, DNS and Denial of Service.  This recommendation aims to close the following gaps:   Routing Threats: Administrators   DNS Spoofing: Administrators   DNS Poisoning: Administrators, Operators   Denial of Service / Flooding: Administrators, Operators  Threat Landscape and Good Practice Guide for Internet Infrastructure  January 2015  Page  29  Recommendation 2: For Internet infrastructure owners, evaluate the application of adapted good  practices in a focused manner.  Internet infrastructure owners should generally consider making use of recommendations of  community driven, well-known open standards organisations such as IETF, Internet Society, Euro-IX  or RIPE. They should also take vendor-specific recommendations into account to secure the  organisation’s hardware and software infrastructure throughout its entire life cycle.  Internet infrastructure owners need to define which measures to apply, and how to deploy them, in  order to enhance the security of individual assets and of their entire system. For instance, they could  prioritise specific security measures by giving more attention to the threats they face. For that  purpose, they can rely on monitoring for example.  This applies to recommendations for technical details such as device configuration or software  development as well as to organisational structures like the securing of business processes and  performing risk assessment.  This recommendation aims to close the following gaps:   Routing Threats: Administrators   DNS Spoofing: Administrators   DNS Poisoning: Administrators, Operators   Denial of Service / Flooding: System configuration, Essential addressing protocols,  Administrators, Operators  Recommendation 3: For Internet infrastructure owners, cooperate with the community to  exchange on threats and promote the application of good practices as mitigation measures.  Internet infrastructure owners need to establish better coordination in the area of Internet  infrastructure security. Security processes and measures at a local, as well as on a larger scale,  require coordination for effective mitigation on technical and operational levels. It also includes the  assignment of responsible personnel and the building of regional, national, and multi-national  communities of trust and information exchange platforms.  The exchange of confidential information can occur:   On the basis of trust;75 since the disclosure of incidents may have a negative impact on the  reputation;   Through regulation and legal obligations, as it exists through Article 13a of EU Directive  2009/140/EC;76   Via Information Sharing and Analysis Centres (ISAC).77  It is also important to commit to participating, this ensures that other organisations experience the  application in practice and may follow suit.  Moreover, such cooperation is beneficial to enhance the security level of the Internet. It shall help  understanding the pre-requisites and challenges linked to the deployment of good practices by  75 http://www.terena.org/news/fullstory.php?news_id=2666  76  “Article 13a of EU Directive 2009/140/EC”, https://ec.europa.eu/digital-agenda/sites/digital- agenda/files/Copy%20of%20Regulatory%20Framework%20for%20Electonic%20Communications%202013%20 NO%20CROPS.pdf  77 “Financial Services Information Sharing and Anlysis Center”, https://www.fsisac.com  http://www.terena.org/news/fullstory.php?news_id=2666 https://ec.europa.eu/digital-agenda/sites/digital-agenda/files/Copy%20of%20Regulatory%20Framework%20for%20Electonic%20Communications%202013%20NO%20CROPS.pdf https://ec.europa.eu/digital-agenda/sites/digital-agenda/files/Copy%20of%20Regulatory%20Framework%20for%20Electonic%20Communications%202013%20NO%20CROPS.pdf https://ec.europa.eu/digital-agenda/sites/digital-agenda/files/Copy%20of%20Regulatory%20Framework%20for%20Electonic%20Communications%202013%20NO%20CROPS.pdf https://www.fsisac.com/  Threat Landscape and Good Practice Guide for Internet Infrastructure  January 2015  Page  30  Internet infrastructure owners. It can also lead to the development of new (community-driven) good  practices to cover emerging threats.   Routing Threats: Administrators   DNS Spoofing: Administrators   DNS Poisoning: Administrators, Operators   Denial of Service / Flooding: System configuration, Essential addressing protocols,  Administrators, Operators  Recommendation 4: For users deploying good practices guides, report on their implementations,  assets covered and gaps found.  For organisations that want to apply existing good practices it is of great help if the good practice  guides shows a list of successful implementations. If this list contains well-known names, the  importance of the good practices is stressed. Also, the organisation that is about to apply the  security measures described in the good practices can contact the other organisations that already  successfully applied the security measures in order to discuss open questions.  For that purpose, it is recommended that organisations deploying good practices report to their  authors inconsistencies, for example cases where the good practice is not directly applicable due to  a very specific Internet infrastructure. In relation with recommendation 3, this exchange of  information can be realised through a community-driven platform.  Moreover, developers of good practices could also highlight the assets covered by the security  measures described and which gaps still exist. This helps organisations applying the security  measures described in the good practice guide to easily understand which assets are covered and  which assets are still untouched.  This recommendation aims to close the following gaps:   Routing Threats: Administrators   DNS Spoofing: Administrators   DNS Poisoning: Administrators, Operators   Denial of Service / Flooding: System configuration, Administrators, Operators  Recommendation 5: Words matter: Ensure the right use of terms and definitions.  For a community within the same domain it is advisable to make use of the same terminology. This  will improve the comprehensibility of written material and help in discussing related topics. Among  others the RFC 494978 provides a set of security terms and definitions.  This recommendation aims to close the following gaps:   Routing Threats: Administrators   DNS Spoofing: Administrators   DNS Poisoning: Administrators, Operators   Denial of Service / Flooding: Administrators, Operators  78 http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4949  http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4949  Threat Landscape and Good Practice Guide for Internet Infrastructure  January 2015  Page  31  8.2 Organisational Recommendations  The organisational recommendations are to be understood and implemented by responsible  management staff and focus on defining operational procedures and processes.  Recommendation 6: For Internet infrastructure owners, use proper risk assessment methods to  understand vulnerable assets in your Internet infrastructure and prioritise your protection actions.  It is advisable that Internet infrastructure owners prioritise actions to protect their Internet  infrastructure. However, only a risk assessment will expose reliable figures about the probability of  potential loss, also denoted as risk. Identified gaps may be covered by implementing measures  presented in the chapter on good practices (cf. Section 7).  This recommendation aims to close the following gaps:   Routing Threats: Administrators   DNS Spoofing: Administrators   DNS Poisoning: Administrators, Operators   Denial of Service / Flooding: System configuration, Essential addressing protocols,  Administrators, Operators, Administrators, Operators  Recommendation 7: Build an information and communication technology security awareness and  training program.  An ICT training program is crucial for the security of the Internet infrastructure in every company.  The content and scope of the program must be tied to existing security directives and established  policies. Further, it must cover all positions within a company and should distinguish between  general security training in order to raise awareness, and special programs tailored to the specific  roles of experts. A basic understanding of security can be obtained with a comprehensive  certification scheme. Nonetheless, it is important to state that although certification is a valuable  building block, it is indeed not a solution to absolutely rely on. Frequent activities ensure practice  readiness and should include extensive debriefing sessions to discuss the lessons learned.  This recommendation aims to close the following gaps:   Routing Threats: Administrators   DNS Spoofing: Administrators   DNS Poisoning: Administrators, Operators   Denial of Service / Flooding: System configuration, Essential addressing protocols,  Administrators, Operators  Recommendation 8: Internet infrastructure owners shall commit third-party vendors to apply  security measures.  Internet infrastructure owners should recommend that the vendor follows certain rules,  recommendations, or certifications in line with their architecture or business model. Those rules  should be defined as a part of the asset owner’s risk assessment under the supervision of the  company’s security personnel. This ensures an extended impact of recommendations and will  improve security sustainable.  This recommendation aims to close the following gaps:   Routing Threats: Administrators   DNS Spoofing: Administrators   DNS Poisoning: Administrators, Operators  Threat Landscape and Good Practice Guide for Internet Infrastructure  January 2015  Page  32   Denial of Service / Flooding: System configuration, Essential addressing protocols,  Administrators, Operators  Recommendation 9: Stay current on any updates.  Stay current on protocol and specification updates, and evaluate the prompt implementation within  your own infrastructure and systems. This can be achieved through participation at conferences and  workshops or simply by subscribing to mailing lists or journals. Practical experience shows that in  many cases updated protocols or specification are available but simply not, or only inadequately,  implemented.  This recommendation aims to close the following gaps:   Routing Threats: Administrators   DNS Spoofing: Administrators   DNS Poisoning: Administrators, Operators   Denial of Service / Flooding: System configuration, Essential addressing protocols,  Administrators, Operators  Threat Landscape and Good Practice Guide for Internet Infrastructure  January 2015  Page  33  9 Conclusion  This Threat Landscape and Good Practice Guide for Internet Infrastructure shall permit Internet  infrastructure owners to secure their assets against important and emerging threats.  For that purpose, this study has classified assets and threats of the Internet infrastructure into mind  maps. It has highlighted the assets involved in Important Specific Threats, which comprise Routing  threats, DNS threats, Denial of Service and Generic threats. Moreover, threats agents, who are at the  origin of the threat, have also mapped for every threat type.  For every Important Specific Threat, trends are evaluated, based on public information: the threat  level is globally increasing at the exception of DNS threats, in decrease (although, the number of  attacks remains elevated).  For each Important Specific Threat, the study details a list of existing good practices that aim at  mitigating these threats. The good practices are associated with the list of assets covered and those  uncovered.  Based on the list of uncovered assets, a gap analysis in performed. It enhances the lack of good  practices addressing the threats linked to human resources (administrators and operators), system  configuration and essential addressing protocols.  Finally, a list of five technical and four organisational recommendations is proposed to improve the  security of the Internet infrastructure. Moreover, Internet infrastructure owners can reuse or adapt  the tools proposed in this study (e.g. mind maps, matrix linking threats and assets, matrix linked  threats and threat agents) to evaluate their level of exposure to current threats. They can also  evaluate (or improve) their current security measures for every assets linked to these threats.  Threat Landscape and Good Practice Guide for Internet Infrastructure  January 2015  Page  34  Description of Internet Infrastructure Assets  This section describes the different groups of the “Internet Infrastructure Assets” taxonomy,  represented by the mind map in Figure 3 and detailed in Annex B. The description does not cover  the full mind map, as this would be going beyond the purpose of this study. This study focus on the  assets of the mind map which are of special interest for the threat analysis and the best common  practice coverage.  Protocols  A protocol is a set of digital rules for data exchange within or between computer systems. Protocols  are valuable assets for the Internet infrastructure because they allow meaningful communication  between different computer systems:   Essential addressing protocols: Essential addressing protocols (e.g., ARP, IPv4, IPv6, DNS) are  used to address one or a group of computer systems in a network. Another set of essential  addressing protocols such as TCP and UDP allow addressing of a particular executable  program running on a single computer system.   Routing protocols: A routing protocol is a set of rules used by routers to determine the most  appropriate paths into which they should forward packets towards their intended final  destinations. To route data within an Internet provider’s own network protocols such as RIP,  MPLS, or OSPF are typically used. Between different Internet providers the routing protocol  BGP is usually employed to exchange routing paths. Routing protocols rely on essential  addressing protocols.   Connectivity protocols: If different essential addressing protocols are used and  communication between these different worlds should be provided, connectivity protocols  can be applied. For instance, to enable IPv6-based communication on an IPv4 network, the  protocol 6to4 can be used. Another example is NAT, which allows the hiding of a network of  unroutable IPv4 addresses behind a single IP address and enabling limited Internet  connectivity.   Application protocols: Executable programs define their own task dependent protocols (e.g.,  HTTP, FTP, or SMTP) to exchange data.  Security protocols: Security protocols are a particular set of digital rules that ensure the  protection of data by applying cryptographic primitives such as signing and encrypting.  Security protocols typically wrap existing application protocols (e.g., HTTPS, FTPS, IMAPS) or  enhance existing protocols (e.g., IPsec, DNSSec).  Services  A service, with regards to the Internet infrastructure, refers to an abstract combination of other  functionalities utilizing other assets in order to fulfil a defined task. Services are important, as  without services the concept of the Internet is of no use. Services can be structured as follows:   Essential addressing: For the different layers of the Internet Protocol Stack addressing  concepts exist which are described in the following section:  o Link layer addressing: For the link layer typically the Ethernet protocol is used which  relies on so-called MAC addresses. The MAC addresses are distinct numbers  assigned to networking hardware devices. Ranges of numbers are managed and  assigned to hardware manufactures by the IEEE.  o Internet Protocol addressing: The Internet Protocol is the principal communication  protocol of the Internet. A unique address is assigned to any communication  participant in order to transmit information through the entire Internet to a defined  Threat Landscape and Good Practice Guide for Internet Infrastructure  January 2015  Page  35  destination. The address space is maintained by IANA, which gives address space to  the various “Regional Internet Registries” (RIRs) (cf. Routing). The RIRs themselves  split up their given address spaces and distribute them to the “Local Internet  Registries” (LIRs). LIRs allocate their customers (e.g., end users or companies) the  given address space in the Internet.  o Transport protocol addressing: The transport protocols provide end-to-end  communication services to software programs of dissimilar hosts. It adds an  abstraction layer onto the Internet Protocol addressing and distinguishes between  different applications on the same host by assigning unique numbers, so-called  ports. These port numbers are maintained by the IANA. Prominent protocols are TCP  and UDP.  o Domain Name System: The domain name system is responsible for translating easily- memorable domain names (e.g., enisa.europa.eu) to numeric Internet Protocol  addresses. Domain names are managed by domain name registrars, which are  organised under a hierarchy headed by the IANA.  o Addressing Unit: In general, for addressing resources in the Internet, the so-called  Uniform Resource Indicators (URIs) are used. The syntax of URIs is as follows: It  starts with a protocol of how the resource can be accessed, followed by a colon and  two slashes, followed by an Internet Protocol address or a domain name, followed  by an optional colon and port number, and finishes with the full path to the  resource. For example:  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/@@search?SearchableText=enisa   Routing: Routing is the process of selecting best paths between two points of  communication in a network. Administrative instances of the routing service, which are  often called \"Regional Internet Registries\" (e.g., RIPE NCC, LACNIC, APNIC, ARIN, AfriNIC)  map network identifiers, so-called autonomous system numbers, to organizations (e.g.,  companies or government entities) which are participating on the Internet.   Applications: Application communication, such as electronic mail or file transfer, relies on  protocols that are implemented by software (e.g., executable programs) in order to provide  a service to end users or machines.   Security: Security services aim to maintain the security goals confidentiality, integrity,  availability, authenticity, and non-repudiation.  Hardware  Hardware is defined as physical components of computer systems such as machines or wiring.  Without hardware no software can be executed or information stored, hence hardware is a valuable  asset. For the Internet infrastructure they are grouped into three categories:   Network devices: Equipment facilitating the use of computer networks are called network  devices. For instance, switches forward frames based on layer 2 addresses, routers utilise  layer 3 addresses to forward packets, firewalls filter network data based on pre-defined  rules, and bridges combine different network segments.   Servers: A server is a computer system that provides services to other computers or users by  running executable programs.   Personal terminals: A personal terminal is an electronic hardware device used for  communication with other computer systems.  Threat Landscape and Good Practice Guide for Internet Infrastructure  January 2015  Page  36  Interconnection  As the Internet is a network of different large computer networks, the assets providing  interconnection functionality are very valuable. Two different kinds of organisations can be defined:   Generic Internet provider: A generic Internet provider is an organization that provides  services for accessing the Internet. Generic Internet providers may be organised in various  forms, such as commercial, community owned, non-profit, or otherwise privately owned.  Internet providers specialise in the kind of service they provide: Data centre operators and  server providers run data centres and rent space or servers respectively. Internet access  providers employ a range of technologies (e.g., Wi-Fi, copper or fibre cables) to connect  users to their network. Backbone providers usually run a larger network and provide  Internet connectivity to Internet access providers, data centres, and server providers.   Internet exchange point: An Internet exchange point consists mainly of one or more switches  to interconnect different Internet providers, in order to exchange Internet traffic between  their networks.  Software  Software is a generic term for collections of computer data and instructions in order to manage  information and store new information, provide access to information, and process it. Software is of  special importance because hardware is often useless without software, and services are built on  top of software. Software can be structured as follows:   Operating systems: Operating systems provide the basic non-task-specific function of  computers. Operating systems are responsible for controlling, integrating, and managing the  individual hardware components of a computer system by relying on device drivers and  firmware so that other task-specific software and users can easily interact with the system.   Device drivers: A device driver is a computer program that operates or controls a particular  type of device that is attached to or integrated into a computer, by talking to the device’s  firmware. Device drivers are often considered to be part of an operating system because  they interact closely with it.   Firmware: The term firmware describes a combination of persistent memory, program code,  and data stored within it. The persistent memory is part of a particular hardware component  (e.g., a line card of a router). A device driver usually communicates with the firmware of a  particular hardware component in order to control or manage it.   Executable programs: A piece of software that is designed to fulfil a particular purpose is  called an executable program. Executable programs require an operating system in order to  be executed.  Infrastructure  The term infrastructure denotes the basic physical structures and facilities (e.g., buildings and  cables) needed for the operation of the Internet. In order to build a worldwide network of networks,  the so-called Internet, the supporting infrastructure is crucial. It can be grouped as follows:   Cabling and linking: Cables and other links are used to interconnect networking devices or  networks. Customarily, those connections are either wired or wireless links.  Miscellaneous types of cable links like copper or fibre are used depending on the network  bandwidth, size, or performance requirements and contingent upon environmental  constraints such as undersea cables, underground cables, or above-ground cables. If the  deployment of physical connections is not feasible or inefficient, wireless links can be  employed instead. Such technologies include Wi-Fi, WiMAX, or LTE.  Threat Landscape and Good Practice Guide for Internet Infrastructure  January 2015  Page  37   Buildings: Buildings are facilities that house assets such as hardware, software, and  interconnection. This ranges from special purpose facilities like landing points where  undersea cables land ashore, to multi-purpose data centres that are used to house all kinds  of hardware and infrastructure.   Power supply: A power supply is a system that supplies electrical energy.   Cooling systems: A cooling system regulates the temperature and humidity properties of air  in order ensure the proper operation of computer systems.   Physical security: Physical security refers to measures that deny unauthorised access to  infrastructure. These measures include but are not limited to fences, walls, and doors.  Information  Information is perception derived from the collection of data. Information is a valuable asset  because systems (e.g., software, hardware, services) and human resources depend on it to make  reasonable decisions. The information assets identified are grouped as follows:   Inventory of hardware, software, infrastructure, information: A list of detailed information  about hardware, software, infrastructure components, and important information such as  configurations. The detailed information may contain the version of the item, the place  where it is located, and invoices, but is not limited to this.   Historical information/statistics: Historical information is information which was collected in  the past and can be accessed in the present. Some kinds of historical information may only  be collected in accordance with the law, other kinds are collected in order to create statistics  on such topics as usage or who has accessed the resource.   Trending information: Attempting to identify trends in the information collected is often  used to predict the future based on past events or behaviour.   Network topology: Network topology is the arrangement of various components (e.g.,  routers, switches, firewalls, servers) of a computer network. Such details may be filed as  network maps or routing tables.   System configuration: System configuration describes how different components (e.g.,  software, hardware) of a system (e.g., software, hardware, services) are configured,  connected, and interoperate in order to achieve a certain goal. For instance, the router MAC  and IP addresses configure its network subsystem.   Operational information: Information that is needed to operate a system is called  operational information. Operational information comprises the status of a system,  measures for certain metrics, events when the state of a system changes, alerts when a  certain threshold for particular metric is reached, and information about shortages or  disturbances.   Credentials: A credential is an attestation of authority issued to a machine or person by a  third party. It might be physical, such as keys and passports, or virtual (e.g. usernames and  passwords, PINs).   User rights policies: User rights policies define the permissions of groups of users (e.g.,  administrators, operators) to certain information (such as computer systems, executable  programs, information).   Lawful interception: Lawful interception is obtaining access to communications network data  pursuant to lawful authority for the purpose of analysis, evidence, or surveillance.  Human Resources  This section defines the personnel which are considered to be a significant asset of the Internet  infrastructure in terms of skills and abilities.  Threat Landscape and Good Practice Guide for Internet Infrastructure  January 2015  Page  38   Administrators: A person that is responsible for setting up, configuring, monitoring, and  maintaining a system (e.g., server, router).   Operators: A person or a company that runs software, machines, or systems.   Support team: A person or a group that provides help on the usage, configuration, or fault  detection of a system or service.   Developers: A person concerned with researching, designing, implementing, and testing of  systems or software.   Managers: A person that is responsible for controlling or administering an organization or  group of staff (e.g., administrators, operators, developers).   Trainers: A person that educates another person on a specific topic.   Auditors: A person that validates and verifies that a person, process, or system, behaves,  runs, or is being used in an environment as previously defined.   End users: A person who actually uses a particular product or service.

In particular RPKI is used  to secure BGP through BGPSec.112  Address space hijacking (IP prefixes):   Utilise resource certification (RPKI) to provide AS origin validation. In particular RPKI is used  to secure BGP through BGPSec.113 114   Establish an Appropriate Use Policy (AUP) as explained in BCP 46, which promotes rules to  secure peering115.   Establish ingress filtering from the edge site to the Internet.112 116 117   Establish Unicast Reverse Path Forwarding to verify the validity of a source IP address.118 119   Establish egress filtering at the boundary router to proactively filter all traffic going to the  customer that has a source address of any of the addresses that have been assigned to that  customer.112   Filter the routing announcements and implement techniques that reduce the risk of putting  excessive load on routing generated by illegitimated route updates/announcements.112 117  For instance, Route Flap Damping (RFD) with a well-defined threshold may contribute to  reducing router processing time.118 119   Registry databases such as IRR, APNIC, ARIN, and RIPE have to be subject to continuous  maintenance. This shall allow usage of updated information to secure peering.112 120 For  example, the “Route Object” field can help validating routes received from peers.112 121 122 123   Configuration updates for the routing infrastructure may only be performed by a defined  authority using strong authentication.112   Monitor the status of BGP to detect unusual behaviour such as path changes or unusual  announcement.123  112 “A Forensic Case Study on AS Hijacking: The Attacker’s Perspective”, Sigcomm CCR 2013,  http://www.sigcomm.org/sites/default/files/ccr/papers/2013/April/2479957-2479959.pdf  113 “Use Cases and Interpretations of Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI) Objects for Issuers and Relying  Parties”, RFC 6907, http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6907  114 “Origin Validation Operation Based on the Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI)”, http://www.rfc- editor.org/bcp/bcp185.txt  115  ”Recommended Internet Service Provider Security Services and Procedures”, Section Network  Infrastructure, http://www.rfc-editor.org/bcp/bcp46.txt  116 “BGP operations and security”, http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-opsec-bgp-security-04  117 “RIPE Anti-Spoofing Task Force HOW-TO” (RIPE-431), http://www.ripe.net/ripe/docs/ripe-431  118 “BGP Route Flap Damping”, http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2439  119 “RIPE: Recommendations on Route Flap Damping”, http://www.ripe.net/ripe/docs/ripe-580  120 “Collective Responsibility and Collaboration for Routing Resilience and Security”,  https://www.routingmanifesto.org  121 “APNIC: Routing object”, http://www.apnic.net/apnic-info/whois_search/about/what-is-in- whois/IRR/routing-objects  122  “RIPE: Managing ROAs”, http://www.ripe.net/lir-services/resource-management/certification/resource- certification-roa-management  123 “BGP Operations and Security”, http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-opsec-bgp-security-05  http://www.sigcomm.org/sites/default/files/ccr/papers/2013/April/2479957-2479959.pdf http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6907 http://www.rfc-editor.org/bcp/bcp185.txt http://www.rfc-editor.org/bcp/bcp185.txt http://www.rfc-editor.org/bcp/bcp46.txt http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-opsec-bgp-security-04 http://www.ripe.net/ripe/docs/ripe-431 http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2439 http://www.ripe.net/ripe/docs/ripe-580 https://www.routingmanifesto.org/ http://www.apnic.net/apnic-info/whois_search/about/what-is-in-whois/IRR/routing-objects http://www.apnic.net/apnic-info/whois_search/about/what-is-in-whois/IRR/routing-objects http://www.ripe.net/lir-services/resource-management/certification/resource-certification-roa-management http://www.ripe.net/lir-services/resource-management/certification/resource-certification-roa-management http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-opsec-bgp-security-05  Threat Landscape and Good Practice Guide for Internet Infrastructure  January 2015  Page  58  Route leaks:   Configure BGP maximum-prefix to ensure the validity of routes announced. If more prefixes  are received, it is sign of an incorrect behaviour and the BGP session shuts down.124 125 126   Utilise resource certification (RPKI) to provide AS origin validation.113 114  BGP session hijacking:   Establish prefix filtering and automation of prefix filters.114 118 122   Employ AS path filtering.116   Use TCP-AO (TCP-Authentication Option) to secure BGP Authentication in order to replace  TCP-MD5. TCP-AO simplifies the exchange of keys.126 127  DNS Threats  DNS registrar hijacking:   Registrants must protect account credentials and define authorised users, while registrars  have to provide a secure authentication process.128 129   Registrants should take advantage of routine correspondence from registrar such as change  notification, billing information, or WHOIS records. Hence, registrars must provide such  information.128 129   Registrants should maintain documentation to “prove registration”.128   Registrants should use separate identities for registrant, technical, administrative, and billing  contacts. Thus, registrars need to allow a more complex user rights management.128 129   Registrars must establish an effective zone data management.128   Registrars should consider supporting DNSSEC.128 129 130   Registrars may monitor DNS change activities.128  DNS spoofing:   Deploying DNSSEC aims to secure DNS clients (resolvers) origin authentication of DNS data,  authenticated denial of existence, and data integrity.131 132  DNS poisoning:   Deploying DNSSEC aims to secure DNS clients (resolvers) origin authentication of DNS data,  authenticated denial of existence, and data integrity.130 131 132   Restrict zone transfers to reduce load on systems and network.133  124 “BGP Configuration best practices”, http://www.ssi.gouv.fr/IMG/pdf/NP_BGP_BCP_en.pdf  125 https://www.allianz-fuer-cybersicherheit.de/ACS/DE/_downloads/techniker/netzwerk/BSI-CS-102.pdf (in  German)  126 “BGP Operations and Security”, http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-opsec-bgp-security-06  127 “RFC 5926: Cryptographic Algorithms for the TCP Authentication Option (TCP-AO)”,  http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5926  128 “A Registrant's Guide to Protecting Domain Name Registration Accounts”,  https://www.icann.org/en/system/files/files/sac-044-en.pdf  129 “Measures to Protect Domain Registration Services Against Exploitation or Misuse”,  https://www.icann.org/en/groups/ssac/documents/sac-040-en.pdf  130 “Root Name Server Operational Requirements“, http://tools.ietf.org/html/bcp40  131  “Good practices guide for deploying DNSSEC”, http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and- CIIP/networks-and-services-resilience/dnssec/gpgdnssec  132 “Detection and countermeasure of forged response cache poisoning attacks”,  http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-fujiwara-dnsop-poisoning-measures-00  http://www.ssi.gouv.fr/IMG/pdf/NP_BGP_BCP_en.pdf https://www.allianz-fuer-cybersicherheit.de/ACS/DE/_downloads/techniker/netzwerk/BSI-CS-102.pdf http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-opsec-bgp-security-06 http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5926 https://www.icann.org/en/system/files/files/sac-044-en.pdf https://www.icann.org/en/groups/ssac/documents/sac-040-en.pdf http://tools.ietf.org/html/bcp40 http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/networks-and-services-resilience/dnssec/gpgdnssec http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/networks-and-services-resilience/dnssec/gpgdnssec http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-fujiwara-dnsop-poisoning-measures-00  Threat Landscape and Good Practice Guide for Internet Infrastructure  January 2015  Page  59   Restrict dynamic updates to only authorised sources in order to avoid misuse.133 Such misuse  include the abuse of a DNS server as an amplifier, DNS cache poisoning…   Set up the authoritative name server as non-recursive.

As a threat landscape, this study gives a detailed overview of the current threats applicable to the  Internet infrastructure and their trends, so that Internet infrastructure owners can improve their  security using good practices.  For that purpose, this study details the assets of Internet infrastructure (structured into eight types:  hardware, software, information, human resources, protocols, services, interconnections, and  infrastructure) and list the threats applicable to these Internet infrastructure assets. These results  are structured into mind maps. The study then classifies Important Specific Threats of the Internet  infrastructure – namely Routing threats, DNS threats, Denial of Service, and Generic threats – and  links each threat with a list of assets exposed.  As a good practice guide, this study details a list of good practices that aim at securing an Internet  infrastructure asset from Important Specific Threats. A gap analysis identifies that some assets  remain not covered by current good practices: human resources (administrators and operators) for  Routing, DNS and Denial of Service, as well as System Configuration and Essential Addressing  Protocols for Denial of Service.  This study provides Internet Infrastructure owners with a guide to assess threats applicable to their  assets. It proposes recommendations to improve the security of the Internet infrastructure. These  recommendations are sorted into:  Five technical recommendations:   Recommendation 1: For Internet Infrastructure owners and electronic communications  network regulatory agencies, evaluate your current level of security by understanding the  assets covered (and not covered) by existing security measures.   Recommendation 2: For Internet infrastructure owners, evaluate the application of adapted  good practices in a focused manner.   Recommendation 3: For Internet infrastructure owners, cooperate with the community to  exchange on threats and promote the application of good practices as mitigation measures.   Recommendation 4: For users deploying good practices guides, report on their  implementations, assets covered and gaps found.   Recommendation 5: Words matter: Ensure the right use of terms and definitions.  And four organisational recommendations:   Recommendation 6: For Internet infrastructure owners, use proper risk assessment methods  to understand vulnerable assets in your Internet infrastructure and prioritise your protection  actions.   Recommendation 7: Build an information and communication technology security  awareness and training program.   Recommendation 8: Internet infrastructure owners shall commit third-party vendors to  apply security measures.   Recommendation 9: Internet infrastructure owners should stay current on any updates.

As a complex system, it largely  depends on different components, mechanisms and functions on various levels of abstraction. The  infrastructure of the Internet, as the underlying base, comprises of hardware, physical  infrastructure, interconnection, software, protocols, information, services, and human resources.  For instance, networks (autonomous systems) are connected by components of the physical layers,  but they are addressed by logical addressing schemes, carrying data via a set of protocols to the  desired destination, and operators who can leap into action when trouble occurs. A failure of those  core components does not only cause a disruption of a network or some participants, but it may also  influence a large portion of the Internet, up to its entirety.  This Threat Landscape and Good Practice Guide for Internet Infrastructure (IITL) is one of the  deliverables (Work Package 1.1 – Deliverable 2) foreseen in the ENISA Work Programme 2014 under  the Work Stream ‘Support EU policy building’.1 It provides an overview of the current state of cyber  security in this domain.  This study is intended to enhance guidance available on the security of the Internet infrastructure.  By doing so, it starts off with taking stock of assets which can be found at Internet infrastructure  operators such as Internet Service Providers (ISP), Internet Exchange Points (IXP), or other network  carriers. Based on assets identified, this study carries out a threat assessment by taking into account  the specifics of the Internet infrastructure and moreover provides a starting point to support further  risk assessments. Those threats are termed as important specific threats for the Internet  infrastructure. Assets and threats are brought together to identify the most important exposures.  Originators of threats, i.e. the threat agents, are classified, described, and mapped to the previously  identified threats. They are taken further into account in order to develop a list of existing measures  such as good practices that aim to reduce the asset’s attack surfaces. Following this, assets not  covered are identified and reasons are given for the lack of protection measures. Finally, the  experience gained during this study is joined with the feedback of the experts who were consulted  to draw a conclusion and summarise technical as well as operational recommendations to support  the protection of the Internet infrastructure and the security of networks.  This study, and notably the recommendations, have been agreed upon with experts from the ENISA  Internet Infrastructure Security and Resilience Reference Group. Due to the assessment performed  and the valuable feedback of experts, this study covers the most important building blocks of the  Internet infrastructure. However, one must be aware that such a study cannot be exhaustive, due to  dynamics of the infrastructure in at stake and the threat environment.  1.1 Policy Context  The Cyber Security Strategy for the EU2 stresses the importance of threat analysis and emerging  trends in cyber security. The ENISA Threat Landscape is an activity towards achieving objectives  formulated in this regulation, in particular by contributing to identifying emerging trends in cyber-  1  “ENISA Work Programme 2014”, http://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/programmes-reports/work- programme-2014 , in particular, p. 16.  2 http://ec.europa.eu/digital-agenda/en/news/eu-cybersecurity-plan-protect-open-internet-and-online- freedom-and-opportunity-cyber-security  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/programmes-reports/work-programme-2014 http://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/programmes-reports/work-programme-2014 http://ec.europa.eu/digital-agenda/en/news/eu-cybersecurity-plan-protect-open-internet-and-online-freedom-and-opportunity-cyber-security http://ec.europa.eu/digital-agenda/en/news/eu-cybersecurity-plan-protect-open-internet-and-online-freedom-and-opportunity-cyber-security  Threat Landscape and Good Practice Guide for Internet Infrastructure  January 2015  Page  2  threats and understanding the evolution of cyber-crime (see ENISA’s Understanding the Importance  of the Internet Infrastructure in Europe).3  Moreover, the new ENISA regulation4 mentions the necessity to analyse current and emerging risks  (and their components), stating: “the Agency, in cooperation with Member States and, as  appropriate, with statistical bodies and others, collects relevant information”. In particular, under  Art. 3, Tasks, d), iii), the new ENISA regulation states that ENISA should “enable effective responses  to current and emerging network and information security risks and threats”.  From the above-mentioned reasons, it becomes apparent that the ENISA Threat Landscape is a  significant contribution to the EU Cyber Security Strategy, streamlining and consolidating available  information on cyber-threats and their evolution.  This study aims to provide a significant contribution towards assessing the cyber threat exposure of  the Internet infrastructure. As such, it will directly contribute to the assessment of cyber security as  well as supporting investor and industry concerns.  1.2 Target Audience  This material is a tool for Internet infrastructure asset owners who, based on this study, wish to  perform detailed threat analyses and risk assessments according to their particular needs/scope (i.e.  asset protection level based on asset impact, vulnerabilities and detail of mitigation measures). In  this study the threat exposure of Internet infrastructure assets is being presented; asset owners may  deepen their threat analysis and risk assessment by using the asset and threat details provided. A  deeper analysis by the asset owners should be based on assessed threats, vulnerabilities, and impact  statements with regard to the concrete assets deployed by the Internet infrastructure operators.  Moreover, policy makers can rely on the Internet infrastructure threat landscape to understand the  current state of threats, trends and associated mitigation measures. Such threat landscape may  constitute an input to develop policy actions in the areas of cyber security, critical infrastructure  protection and Internet infrastructure in particular.  Through the significant number of reports collected, the Internet infrastructure threat landscape  provides a unique collection of information regarding cyber security threats. Hence, a further target  group of this study are individuals who would like to obtain access to these sources in order to use  them for their own purposes.  1.3 Scope of the Study  The definition of the Internet used throughout this study is similar to the definition employed by RFC  2026:5  The Internet, a loosely-organized international collaboration of autonomous, interconnected  networks, supports host-to-host communication through voluntary adherence to open protocols and  procedures defined by Internet Standards. There are also many isolated interconnected networks,  which are not connected to the global Internet but use the Internet Standards.  3 ENISA, “Understanding the Importance of the Internet Infrastructure in Europe”,  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/critical-infrastructure-and-services/inter- x/guidelines-for-enhancing-the-resilience-of-ecommunication-networks  4 http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2013:165:0041:0058:EN:PDF  5 RFC 2026, http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2026.txt  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/critical-infrastructure-and-services/inter-x/guidelines-for-enhancing-the-resilience-of-ecommunication-networks https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/critical-infrastructure-and-services/inter-x/guidelines-for-enhancing-the-resilience-of-ecommunication-networks http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2013:165:0041:0058:EN:PDF http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2026.txt  Threat Landscape and Good Practice Guide for Internet Infrastructure  January 2015  Page  3  Based on this definition, the Internet Infrastructure consists of a wide range of assets residing on  different physical and logical layers, which are crucial for its proper operation. The scope of this  study focuses on the threats applicable to these physical and logical assets, as presented in Figure 1.  Figure 1 – Focus of the Threat Landscape and Good Practice Guide for Internet Infrastructure  This study proposes a threat landscape, which is an overview of current threats applicable to the  Internet Infrastructure and their associated trends. The goal is to enhance the security of the  Internet Infrastructure by detailing a list of good practices and recommendations for important  specific threats.  1.4 Structure of this Study  The remainder of this study is organised as follows:  Chapter 2 gives insight into the methodology followed during the execution of this study.  Chapter 3 presents all relevant Internet infrastructure asset types. An overview of the assets and  their dependencies is depicted in a mind map.  Chapter 4 elaborates on the threat types that the previously defined assets are exposed to. The  developed taxonomy is presented as mind map and the most relevant threats are clustered into  important specific threat groups and their trends are indicated.  Chapter 5 deals with the exposure of the identified assets to cyber threats.  Chapter 6 introduces the threat agents and maps them in regard with the threat types.  Chapter 7 lists and summarises available Internet infrastructure security measures mitigating the  important specific threats. Assets which are not covered are identified and the reasons are outlined.  Chapter 8 builds on lessons learned during the study and summarises experiences gained in  technical and organisational recommendations.  Chapter 9 concludes.  All material that is referenced by a URL in the footnotes is available on the day of publication of this  study. It is also worth mentioning that in order to keep the size of this study manageable, detailed  material is provided by means of annexes. These shall support Internet infrastructure asset owners  to perform a risk assessment.  Telecommunication Infrastructure  (routers, cables...)

Subsequently, security measures have to be introduced to achieve assessed protection  levels by mitigating (part of) the assessed risks. Other risks might be transferred or accepted. As  discussed below, threats are an important element in risk assessment.  In this section, the methodology followed in the IITL is presented. It consists of a number of threats  to which the Internet Infrastructure assets are exposed. Hence, the presented IITL is an important  tool for those who want to assess the risks within an IT environment of any complexity. Based on  these risks, appropriate security measures can be selected to achieve risk mitigation. Identified good  practices can be used as a guideline for achieving this goal.  The role of threats in the risk assessment equations becomes evident when looking at the  components of risks. According to the widely accepted ISO 27005 definition, risks emerge when:  “Threats abuse vulnerabilities of assets to generate harm for the organization”. In more detailed  terms, the risk is considered as taking into account the following elements:  Asset (Vulnerabilities, Controls), Threat (Threat Agent Profile, Likelihood) and Impact  This study does not assume the use of any particular Internet or network infrastructure equipment  or the operational processes or services. As such, it is impossible to make any valid assumptions  about impact and vulnerabilities of assets. These are activities that can solely be performed by the  asset owner. Hence, the need for supporting tools for the performance of risk assessments becomes  obvious and essential for the asset owner in this complex environment.  The elements of risks are graphically depicted in Figure 2 below:  Figure 2– Threats targeting an asset by trying to exploit its vulnerabilities  This figure has been adopted from ISO 13335-4 and shows how threat agents (cf. Chapter 6),  deploying threats (T), try to exploit asset vulnerabilities (V) in order to harm/take over the asset. The  asset owner has implemented security measures (M) to protect the asset, that is, to eliminate or  significantly reduce its vulnerabilities. The impact achieved by the potential materialization of a  threat is the final element to evaluate the risk of an asset (see also risk definition above).  6 “ENISA Threat Landscape 2013”, https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/risk-management/evolving-threat- environment/enisa-threat-landscape-2013-overview-of-current-and-emerging-cyber-threats  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/risk-management/evolving-threat-environment/enisa-threat-landscape-2013-overview-of-current-and-emerging-cyber-threats https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/risk-management/evolving-threat-environment/enisa-threat-landscape-2013-overview-of-current-and-emerging-cyber-threats  Threat Landscape and Good Practice Guide for Internet Infrastructure  January 2015  Page  5  3 Internet Infrastructure Assets  According to ENISA’s Guideline on Threats and Assets7 published in the context of ENISA’s Security  framework for Article 4 and 13a8 proposal, an asset is defined as “… anything of value. Assets can be  abstract assets (like processes or reputation), virtual assets (for instance, data), physical assets  (cables, a piece of equipment), human resources, money”. Nevertheless, for information security  considerations this study focuses on assets that are mainly related to information and  communication technology (ICT) under the scope of the Internet infrastructure.  Assets of the Internet infrastructure ensure the connectivity of networks from a physical and logical  point of view. An asset taxonomy is presented to structure all relevant assets, illustrated in Figure 3.  Due to the complexity of the Internet infrastructure the assets are grouped into asset types of  different granularity and scope. For instance, the operation of a router requires the hardware which  can be found at a physical location, a configuration, software that instantiates the configuration,  essential addressing services for interconnection defined by a set of protocols, and an operator to  monitor its current state. Hence, the granularity of asset types, even if they are arranged on the  same level of the taxonomy, may vary. In addition to the ICT assets, several non-IT assets are  identified. They strongly depend on ICT and are central for the proper operation of the Internet. For  instance, buildings, power supply, cooling systems, or human resources. A detailed description of  these assets is given in Annex A.  Figure 3 – Assets of the Internet infrastructure (levels 1 and 2 - see Annex B for the expanded mind map)  The mind map presented in Figure 3 gives an overview of all assets determined and is structured into  asset types according to their use. However, an asset is not necessarily an exclusive member of just  one asset type. For readability, the details of the mind map are limited to the secondary level. An  expanded version is presented in Annex B. In the following the asset types are presented for the first  level of the mind map:  7 https://resilience.enisa.europa.eu/article-13/guideline_on_threats_and_assets/guideline-on-threats-and- assets/at_download/file  8 http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/Incidents-reporting/proposal-for-one-security- framework-for-articles-4-and-13a/at_download/fullReport  Human resources  Auditors  End users  Trainers  Managers  Developers  Support teams  Administrators  Operators  Infrastructure  Physical security  Cooling systems  Power supply  Buildings  Cabling and linking  Interconnection Generic Internet provider  Internet exchange point  Services  Security  Applications  Routing  Essential addressing  Information  Lawful interception  User rights policies  Credentials  Operational information  Inventory of hardware, software, infrastructure, configuration  Historical information/statistics  Trending information  Network topology  System configuration  Software  Executable programs  Firmwares  Device drivers  Operating systems  Hardware  Personnel terminals  Servers  Network devices  Protocols  Security protocols  Application protocols  Connectivity protocols  Routing protocols  Essential addressing protocols  Internet Infrastructure Assets  https://resilience.enisa.europa.eu/article-13/guideline_on_threats_and_assets/guideline-on-threats-and-assets/at_download/file https://resilience.enisa.europa.eu/article-13/guideline_on_threats_and_assets/guideline-on-threats-and-assets/at_download/file http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/Incidents-reporting/proposal-for-one-security-framework-for-articles-4-and-13a/at_download/fullReport http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/Incidents-reporting/proposal-for-one-security-framework-for-articles-4-and-13a/at_download/fullReport  Threat Landscape and Good Practice Guide for Internet Infrastructure  January 2015  Page  6  The asset types hardware, software, information, and human resources comprise the same assets  as in former studies7 10 and can be thought of as intuitively clear. Moreover, the following are  particularly applicable to the Internet infrastructure:   A protocol is a set of digital rules for data exchange within or between computer systems.  Protocols are valuable assets for the Internet infrastructure because they allow meaningful  communication between different computer systems.   A service, with regards to the Internet infrastructure, refers to an abstract combination of  other functionalities utilizing other assets in order to fulfil a defined task. Services are  important, as the Internet is built around services.   Interconnection covers the organisations building and running large computer networks. As  the Internet is a network of different large computer networks, the assets providing  interconnection functionality are very valuable.   The term infrastructure denotes the basic physical structures and facilities (e.g., buildings  and cables) needed for the operation of the Internet. In order to build a worldwide network  of networks, the so-called Internet, the supporting infrastructure is crucial.  The asset taxonomy presented should only be considered as a snapshot of the complex range of  Internet assets and can as such not be exhaustive.  Threat Landscape and Good Practice Guide for Internet Infrastructure  January 2015  Page  7  4 Threats of the Internet Infrastructure  4.1 Threat types  According to the ENISA Glossary,9 a threat is “any circumstance or event with the potential to  adversely impact an asset through unauthorized access, destruction, disclosure, modification of data,  and/or denial of service”.  Based on the identified assets within the previous chapter a taxonomy of relevant threats impeding  the Internet infrastructure or at least significant parts is developed.  Since this study focuses on information security, the threat taxonomy presented mainly covers cyber  security threats. However, for faultless operation, physical assets are also required and therefore  several specific non-IT threats are assumed. The identified threats are a consolidation of the  publications ENISA Threat Landscape 2013,6 the Smart Grid Threat Landscape and Good Practice  Guide,10 the Security Framework for Article 4 and 13a proposal,11 and ENISA’s Guideline on Threats  and Assets.12 Consecutively, the first level of the threat taxonomy is presented and some instances  of associated threats are provided.  The threats have been regrouped under threat types, each threat type representing the source  cause of a threat. They are the following:   Physical attacks are intentional offensive actions which aim to destroy, expose, alter,  disable, steal or gain unauthorised access to physical assets such as infrastructure,  hardware, or interconnection. This threat type basically applies to any kind of infrastructure  in general, thus also to the Internet infrastructure. Instances, among others, are vandalism,  theft, sabotage, information leakage, and bomb attacks.   A disaster is a serious disruption of the functioning of a society and can be divided into  natural disasters not directly triggered by humans, and environmental disasters directly  caused by human. Those threats apply to any kind of asset in general, hence also to the  Internet infrastructure. Typical threats of this class are earthquakes, floods, wildfires and  pollution, dust, or corrosion.   The condition of not or insufficient functioning of any Internet infrastructure asset is defined  as failure or malfunction. For example, failures or disruptions of network devices or  systems, software bugs, or configuration errors.   Outages are unexpected disruptions of service or decrease in quality falling below a required  level. This includes all kinds of assets, even human resources. Outages may have many  reasons, including, but not limited to, lack of resources, exhaustions, power surges, or  human factors like absence of personnel.  9 ENISA Glossary, https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/risk-management/current-risk/risk-management- inventory/glossary  10 ENISA, “Smart Grid Threat Landscape”, https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/risk-management/evolving- threat-environment/sgtl/smart-grid-threat-landscape-and-good-practice-guide  11 ENISA, “Security Framework for Article 4 and 13a proposal”,  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/Incidents-reporting/proposal-for-one-security- framework-for-articles-4-and-13a  12 https://resilience.enisa.europa.eu/article-13/guideline_on_threats_and_assets/guideline-on-threats-and- assets/at_download/file  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/risk-management/current-risk/risk-management-inventory/glossary https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/risk-management/current-risk/risk-management-inventory/glossary https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/risk-management/evolving-threat-environment/sgtl/smart-grid-threat-landscape-and-good-practice-guide https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/risk-management/evolving-threat-environment/sgtl/smart-grid-threat-landscape-and-good-practice-guide http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/Incidents-reporting/proposal-for-one-security-framework-for-articles-4-and-13a http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/Incidents-reporting/proposal-for-one-security-framework-for-articles-4-and-13a https://resilience.enisa.europa.eu/article-13/guideline_on_threats_and_assets/guideline-on-threats-and-assets/at_download/file https://resilience.enisa.europa.eu/article-13/guideline_on_threats_and_assets/guideline-on-threats-and-assets/at_download/file  Threat Landscape and Good Practice Guide for Internet Infrastructure  January 2015  Page  8   Unintentional damage refer to destruction, harm, or injury to property or persons by  accident. Damage includes physical damage as well as information leakage, system  alterations, inadequate designs, or lack of adaptation.   Damage refers to destruction, harm, or injury of property or persons and results in a failure  or reduction in usefulness. The concrete threats are similar to the unintentional damage but  primarily focus on IT assets and imply intention. Important representatives are such threats  as loss of information, loss of reputation, and loss of hardware.   Nefarious activities and abuse are intended actions that target ICT systems, infrastructure,  and/or networks by means of malicious acts with the aim to either steal, alter, or destroy a  specified target. This class of the taxonomy arranges common threats generally referred to  as cyber attacks and related actions such as spam, malware, hardware and software  manipulation, distributed denial of service (DDoS), unauthorised usage, social engineering,  or exploitation of software bugs.   Eavesdropping/Interception/Hijacking refers to a class of actions aiming to listen, interrupt,  or seize control of a third party communication without consent.   Legal threats can be envisaged, intended, or on-going legal actions of third parties  (contracting or otherwise), in order to prohibit actions or compensate for loss based on  applicable law. Such legal threats include violation of laws, court orders, and failure to meet  contractual requirements that are carried out by or are attributed to service providers of  service beneficiaries of the network infrastructure.  Figure 4 – Threat taxonomy of the Internet infrastructure (levels 1 and 2 - see Annex C for the expanded mind map)  The mind map presented in Figure 4 structures all identified threat types and the particular  associated threats.

However, they are subject to changes in the event of new developments and should  be considered as living documents reflecting dynamic changes in the cyber threat environment.  Threat Landscape and Good Practice Guide for Internet Infrastructure  January 2015  Page  10  4.2 Important Specific Threats of the Internet Infrastructure  In this chapter, threats specific to the Internet infrastructure are identified. As stated previously, the  Internet is the backbone of our modern information society and thus vulnerabilities within this  crucial infrastructure are not limited to single companies or some end-users, but may put a  significant portion of the Internet at danger. This threatens the daily life of thousands of users. The  previously developed threat taxonomy (cf. Chapter 4) includes several threats applicable to  information and telecommunication technology in general, hence also to be considered for the  Internet infrastructure. However, to take the scope of this study into account, the consideration of  solely Internet Infrastructure threats is advisable for a deeper analysis. It admits a deeper  understanding of threat details and allows concentration on the protection of relevant assets during  the stock taking of the good practices in Chapter 7 below.  To identify important specific threats this study takes stock of authoritative threat reports. The  material analysed has been published by private and public institutions and communities.13 14 15 16  For each threat the importance according to frequency of appearance, giving an estimation if no  valid data could be found, and expert's judgments is evaluated. The list developed was reviewed  during interviews with experts in the field and ENISA's Internet Infrastructure Security and Resilience  Reference Group.17  The conclusive listing is clustered into threat groups according to the exposed assets. Each threat  group regroups the threats menacing a particular technical domain and/or technology, with no  discrimination in regard with their threat type. The main threat groups are routing threats, DNS  threats, DDoS threats, and generic threats which are not specific to the Internet infrastructure as  denoted above. Thus, threats and threat groups presented within this section reflect the current  state-of-play but are not, and will never be exhaustive. However, one can argue that the given set of  threats still have strong relevance and should be considered within risk assessments conducted by  asset owners.  Subsequently, threat groups and their threats are presented. For each threat group the related  threat type in the presented taxonomy is referred to, followed by a description of all subordinate  specific important threats. The level of detail is limited to a certain extent to maintain readability. In  order to illustrate the importance of the threat, it is supplemented with an example of a recent  incident. Note that the list is not prioritised, but trends for the threat groups are provided so that  asset owners can evaluate their priorities after a risk assessment.  4.2.1 Routing Threats  Routing is subject to attacks that can harm the interconnection of networks as well as the operation  of single networks. A smooth operation of routing infrastructure is crucial for the robustness of the  13 Verizon, “2014 Data Breach Investigations Report”, 2014,  http://www.verizonenterprise.com/DBIR/2014/reports/rp_dbir-2014-executive-summary_en_xg.pdf  14 “Cloud Computing Top Threats in 2013”, Cloud Security Alliance, 2013,  https://downloads.cloudsecurityalliance.org/initiatives/top_threats/The_Notorious_Nine_Cloud_Computing_T op_Threats_in_2013.pdf  15 “IBM Security Services Cyber Security Intelligence Index”, IBM, 2013, https://www- 935.ibm.com/services/multimedia/Cyber_security_Index.pdf  16 “BSI Threats Catalogue”, Federal Office for Information Security, 2012,  https://www.bsi.bund.de/SharedDocs/Downloads/EN/BSI/Grundschutz/download/threats_catalogue.pdf?__b lob=publicationFile  17 https://resilience.enisa.europa.eu/internet-infrastructure-security-and-resilience-reference-group  http://www.verizonenterprise.com/DBIR/2014/reports/rp_dbir-2014-executive-summary_en_xg.pdf https://downloads.cloudsecurityalliance.org/initiatives/top_threats/The_Notorious_Nine_Cloud_Computing_Top_Threats_in_2013.pdf https://downloads.cloudsecurityalliance.org/initiatives/top_threats/The_Notorious_Nine_Cloud_Computing_Top_Threats_in_2013.pdf https://www-935.ibm.com/services/multimedia/Cyber_security_Index.pdf https://www-935.ibm.com/services/multimedia/Cyber_security_Index.pdf https://www.bsi.bund.de/SharedDocs/Downloads/EN/BSI/Grundschutz/download/threats_catalogue.pdf?__blob=publicationFile https://www.bsi.bund.de/SharedDocs/Downloads/EN/BSI/Grundschutz/download/threats_catalogue.pdf?__blob=publicationFile https://resilience.enisa.europa.eu/internet-infrastructure-security-and-resilience-reference-group  Threat Landscape and Good Practice Guide for Internet Infrastructure  January 2015  Page  11  Internet. Most threats break down routing functions by hijacking, misusing, misconfiguring, or  intercepting assigned numbers, addresses, or name spaces. The current trend indicates that this  threat is on the rise.  Nefarious Activity/Abuse Eavesdropping/Interception/ Hijacking  Autonomous  System (AS)  hijacking  Address space  hijacking  (IP prefixes)  Route leaks BGP session  hijacking  Table 1 – Application of Important Specific Threat to routing  Table 1 highlights the application of important specific threats to the routing infrastructure, for Tier  1 networks, Tier 2 ISPs and IXPs, Tier 3 ISPs and final users. The extent of a threat is represented by a  coloured bar, which denotes how the threat applies to the layers pictured on the left-hand side  schema. Routing threats apply to all layers of the Internet Infrastructure.  These important specific threats are now detailed and their trends are presented.  Threat Type: Nefarious Activity/Abuse  Trend: Increasing 6  Threat: Autonomous System (AS) hijacking  AS hijacking attacks aim at impersonating a victim’s organization. The motivation behind this type of  attack is malicious: activities conducted with the hijacked network are masked and appear to be  carried out on the behalf of the victim itself. Such attacks are characterised by an attacker  announcing the victim’s prefixes that originate at the victim’s AS.18  Example:   A forensic case study on AS hijacking: the attacker’s perspective18  Threat: Address space hijacking (IP prefixes)  This threat occurs when a rogue BGP peer maliciously announces a victim's prefixes in an effort to  reroute some or all traffic through its own networks for untoward purposes (for example, to view  contents of traffic that the router would otherwise not be able to read).19 20 21  Examples:   Hacker redirects traffic from 19 Internet providers to steal bitcoins22   Hijack by AS4761 – Indosat, a quick report23  18 “A Forensic Case Study on AS Hijacking: The Attacker’s Perspective”,  http://www.sigcomm.org/sites/default/files/ccr/papers/2013/April/2479957-2479959.pdf  19 “Protecting Border Gateway Protocol for the Enterprise”,  http://www.cisco.com/web/about/security/intelligence/protecting_bgp.html  20 “Beware of BGP Attacks”, http://www.cc.gatech.edu/~dovrolis/Papers/ccr-bgp.pdf  21 “Threat Model for BGP Path Security”, http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7132  22 http://www.secureworks.com/cyber-threat-intelligence/threats/bgp-hijacking-for-cryptocurrency-profit  Tier 1 network  Tier 2 ISPs IXPs Tier 2 ISPs  Tier 3 ISPs Tier 3 ISPs Tier 3 ISPs  Internet users  (businesses, consumers)  http://www.sigcomm.org/sites/default/files/ccr/papers/2013/April/2479957-2479959.pdf http://www.cisco.com/web/about/security/intelligence/protecting_bgp.html http://www.cc.gatech.edu/~dovrolis/Papers/ccr-bgp.pdf http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7132 http://www.secureworks.com/cyber-threat-intelligence/threats/bgp-hijacking-for-cryptocurrency-profit/  Threat Landscape and Good Practice Guide for Internet Infrastructure  January 2015  Page  12   The new threat: targeted Internet traffic misdirection24   Looking at the Spamhaus DDoS from a BGP perspective25   Pakistan hijacks YouTube26  Threat Type: Eavesdropping/Interception/Hijacking Trend: Increasing 6  Threat: Route leaks  A route leak is said to occur when AS A advertises BGP routes that it has received from AS B to its  neighbors, but AS A is not viewed as a transit provider for the announced prefixes.27  Examples:   Hijack by AS4761 – Indosat, a quick report23   How the Internet in Australia went down under28   Large route leaks29  Threat: BGP session hijacking  BGP session hijacking denotes an alteration of the contents of the BGP routing table by a malicious  device, which can, among other impacts, prevent traffic from reaching the intended destination  without acknowledgement or notification.30 31 32  Example:   Short-Lived BGP Session Hijacking33   Measuring and Analyzing on Effection of BGP Session Hijack Attack34  4.2.2 DNS Threats  The DNS system is exposed to threats that aim to bring down a central feature which allows  convenient web browsing for non-technical users and enables flexible addressing for automated  systems. Without the resolution of domain names into IP addresses the Internet is inaccessible for  the general public. Attacks attempt to alter DNS records to redirect traffic, interrupt operation, or  introduce censorship. The latest trends show a decrease for this sort of threat. However, this does  not diminish its importance.  23 http://www.bgpmon.net/hijack-by-as4761-indosat-a-quick-report  24 http://www.renesys.com/2013/11/mitm-internet-hijacking/  25 http://www.bgpmon.net/looking-at-the-spamhouse-ddos-from-a-bgp-perspective/  26 http://www.renesys.com/2008/02/pakistan-hijacks-youtube-1/  27 “Threat Model for BGP Path Security”, http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7132  28 http://www.bgpmon.net/how-the-internet-in-australia-went-down-under/  29 http://nrl.cs.arizona.edu/projects/lsrl-events-from-2003-to-2009/  30 “Protecting Border Gateway Protocol for the Enterprise”,  http://www.cisco.com/web/about/security/intelligence/protecting_bgp.html  31 “Beware of BGP Attacks”, http://www.cc.gatech.edu/~dovrolis/Papers/ccr-bgp.pdf  32 “Threat Model for BGP Path Security”: http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7132  33 https://www.usenix.org/publications/login/december-2006-volume-31-number-6/homeless-vikings-short- lived-bgp-session-hijacki  34 “Measuring and Analyzing on Effection of BGP Session Hijack Attack”, http://www.wseas.us/e- library/conferences/2013/Rhodes/CIRCOM/CIRCOM-13.pdf  http://www.bgpmon.net/hijack-by-as4761-indosat-a-quick-report http://www.renesys.com/2013/11/mitm-internet-hijacking/ http://www.bgpmon.net/looking-at-the-spamhouse-ddos-from-a-bgp-perspective/ http://www.renesys.com/2008/02/pakistan-hijacks-youtube-1/ http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7132 http://www.bgpmon.net/how-the-internet-in-australia-went-down-under/ http://nrl.cs.arizona.edu/projects/lsrl-events-from-2003-to-2009/ http://www.cisco.com/web/about/security/intelligence/protecting_bgp.html http://www.cc.gatech.edu/~dovrolis/Papers/ccr-bgp.pdf http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7132 https://www.usenix.org/publications/login/december-2006-volume-31-number-6/homeless-vikings-short-lived-bgp-session-hijacki https://www.usenix.org/publications/login/december-2006-volume-31-number-6/homeless-vikings-short-lived-bgp-session-hijacki http://www.wseas.us/e-library/conferences/2013/Rhodes/CIRCOM/CIRCOM-13.pdf http://www.wseas.us/e-library/conferences/2013/Rhodes/CIRCOM/CIRCOM-13.pdf  Threat Landscape and Good Practice Guide for Internet Infrastructure  January 2015  Page  13  Nefarious Activity/Abuse  DNS registrar  hijacking  DNS spoofing DNS poisoning Domain name  collision  Table 2 – Application of Important Specific Threat to DNS  Table 2 highlights the application of important specific threats to the DNS infrastructure. The DNS  infrastructure is represented by an abstract (simplified) tree, which shows a combination of several  typical layers. The extent of a threat is represented by a coloured bar, which denotes how the threat  applies to the layers pictured on the left-hand side schema. Important specific threats for DNS apply  to different extents to the Internet Infrastructure.  These important specific threats are now detailed and their trends are presented.  Threat Type: Nefarious Activity/Abuse  Trend: Decreasing 6  Threat: DNS registrar hijacking  If a DNS registrar is hijacked, all domains under its control are in jeopardy: the domain registration  information can be altered, which might result in a transfer of the domain to another registrar or  result in a type of identity theft. Once this has been done, the hijacker has full control of all the  domains and can use them or sell them to a third party.35  Example:   Popular registrar Namecheap fixes DNS hijack bug36  Threat: DNS spoofing  DNS spoofing refers to the broad category of attacks that spoof DNS records. There are many  different ways to do DNS spoofing: compromise a DNS server, mount a DNS cache poisoning attack,  mount a man-in-the-middle attack, guess a sequence number, and many more.  Example:   Subverting BIND’s SRTT algorithm derandomizing NS selection37  Threat: DNS poisoning  DNS (cache) poisoning is an attack technique that allows an attacker to introduce forged DNS  information into the cache of a caching domain name server. There are published articles that  describe a number of inherent deficiencies in the DNS protocol and defects in common DNS  implementations that facilitate DNS cache poisoning.38  Examples:   Abusing anti-DDoS mechanisms to perform DNS cache poisoning39   Fragmentation considered poisonous40  35 “Popular Registrar Namecheap Fixes DNS Hijack Bug”, http://threatpost.com/popular-registrar-namecheap- fixes-dns-hijack-bug  36 http://threatpost.com/popular-registrar-namecheap-fixes-dns-hijack-bug  37 https://www.usenix.org/conference/woot13/workshop-program/presentation/hay  38 “Multiple DNS implementations vulnerable to cache poisoning”, http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/800113  39 http://www.ssi.gouv.fr/en/the-anssi/publications-109/scientific-publications/conference/abusing-anti-ddos- mechanisms-to-perform-dns-cache-poisoning.html  http://threatpost.com/popular-registrar-namecheap-fixes-dns-hijack-bug http://threatpost.com/popular-registrar-namecheap-fixes-dns-hijack-bug http://threatpost.com/popular-registrar-namecheap-fixes-dns-hijack-bug https://www.usenix.org/conference/woot13/workshop-program/presentation/hay http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/800113 http://www.ssi.gouv.fr/en/the-anssi/publications-109/scientific-publications/conference/abusing-anti-ddos-mechanisms-to-perform-dns-cache-poisoning.html http://www.ssi.gouv.fr/en/the-anssi/publications-109/scientific-publications/conference/abusing-anti-ddos-mechanisms-to-perform-dns-cache-poisoning.html  Threat Landscape and Good Practice Guide for Internet Infrastructure  January 2015  Page  14  Threat: Domain name collision  A name collision refers to an attempt to resolve a name that is utilised in a private name space (e.g.  non-delegated Top Level Domain, or a short, unqualified name), resulting in a DNS query to the  public DNS, and a matching name can be retrieved. In most cases, the cause is a misconfiguration  and disregards ICANN recommendations. Name collision occurrences are not new and have  historically been observed and reported as queries containing non-delegated TLDs at the root level  of the DNS. They have received renewed attention because many applied for new TLD strings that  are identical to name space labels used in private networks.41  Examples:   Looking at corp.com as a proxy for .corp42   Reports for alternate path to delegation published43  4.2.3 Denial of Service (DoS/Distributed DoS (DDoS)) Threats  Denial of service attacks endeavour to make a computer system or network unavailable to its  intended users. Basically, every single system can be targeted by DoS ranging from a simple home  computer to a major web server farm. There are several different approaches which amplify the  intensity of an attack. Especially this kind of attack is increasing these days.  Nefarious Activity/Abuse  DDoS  amplification /reflection  DoS  flooding  DoS protocol  exploitation  DoS  malformed  packet attack  DoS  application  attack  Table 3 – Application of Important Specific Threat to Denial of Service  Table 3 highlights the application of important specific threats regarding Denial of Service. The  Internet architecture shown in the picture is simplified and abstracted in order to show the  important parts in regard to DoS. The extent of a threat is represented by a coloured bar, which  denotes how the threat applies to the layers pictured on the left-hand side schema. Important  specific threats for DoS apply to different extents to the Internet Infrastructure.  These important specific threats are now detailed and their trends are presented.  Threat Type: Nefarious Activity/Abuse Trend: Increasing 6  Threat: DDoS amplification/reflection  In a reflection DDoS attack, the attacker spoofs the victim’s IP address and sends a request for  information via UDP to servers known to respond to that type of request. The servers answer the  request and send the response to the victim’s IP address. All data from those servers adds up to  40 http://arxiv.org/abs/1205.4011  41 “Name Collision in the DNS”, https://www.icann.org/en/system/files/files/name-collision-02aug13-en.pdf  42 http://namecollisions.net/downloads/wpnc14_slides_strutt_looking_at_corpcom.pdf  43 http://newgtlds.icann.org/en/announcements-and-media/announcement-2-17nov13-en  Internet  http://www.icann.org/en/groups/ssac/documents/sac-045-en.pdf http://www.icann.org/en/groups/ssac/documents/sac-045-en.pdf http://arxiv.org/abs/1205.4011 https://www.icann.org/en/system/files/files/name-collision-02aug13-en.pdf http://namecollisions.net/downloads/wpnc14_slides_strutt_looking_at_corpcom.pdf http://newgtlds.icann.org/en/announcements-and-media/announcement-2-17nov13-en  Threat Landscape and Good Practice Guide for Internet Infrastructure  January 2015  Page  15  significant bandwidth, enough to congest the target’s Internet connectivity. With bandwidth maxed  out, normal traffic cannot be serviced and legitimate clients cannot connect.44  Examples:   The technical details behind a 400 Gbps NTP amplification DDoS attack45   Deep inside a DNS amplification DDoS attack46   The DDoS that knocked Spamhaus offline (and how we mitigated it)47  Threat: DoS flooding  A flood is a simple denial-of-service attack where the attacker overwhelms the victim with packets  (e.g. ICMP ping packets). It is most successful if the attacker has more bandwidth than the victim (for  instance, an attacker with a DSL line and the victim on a dial-up modem). The attacker may hope  that the victim will respond to its packets (e.g. ICMP echo reply packets), thus consuming both  outgoing bandwidth as well as incoming bandwidth.

It is a summary of important threats rather than  a complete list and should raise awareness that even very common attacks may harm the Internet  infrastructure.  Threat Type: Physical attack  Trend: Not available  A physical attack can constitute a threat to an organization, certain areas of the organization or  individuals. The technical possibilities to perpetrate an attack are numerous: throwing bricks, blasts  by explosives, use of firearms or arson.57  Threat Type: Damage/Loss  Trend: Increasing 6  Any incident where a) an asset (e.g. sea-cable, device, information) is damaged by accident or in bad  faith or b) an asset (e.g. storage media, documents) goes missing, whether through misplacement or  malice.13  Threat Type: Failures/Malfunctions  Trend: Increasing 58  Threat: Failure of devices or systems  Due to dependencies of technical infrastructure, single failures of individual components, such as air- conditioning or power supply facilities, may contribute to the failure of a device or even the entire  system. In particular, key components of an IT system (for example, servers and network coupling  elements) are likely to cause such failures.59  Threat: Configuration errors  Configuration error attacks exploit configuration weaknesses found in software. Software may come  with unnecessary and unsafe features, such as debug and QA features, enabled by default. These  features may provide a means for an attacker to bypass authentication methods and gain access to  sensitive information, perhaps with elevated privileges. Likewise, default installations may include  well-known usernames and passwords, hard-coded backdoor accounts, special access mechanisms,  and incorrect permissions set for files accessible through web servers. Default samples may be  accessible in production environments. Configuration files that are not properly locked down may  reveal clear text connection strings to the database, and default settings in configuration files may  not have been set with security in mind. All of these misconfigurations may lead to unauthorised  access to sensitive information.60  55 http://www.gartner.com/newsroom/id/2344217  56 http://www.darkreading.com/attacks-breaches/ddos-attack-used-headless-browsers-in-150-hour- siege/d/d-id/1140696?  57 “Threats Catalogue – Elementary Threats”,  https://www.bsi.bund.de/SharedDocs/Downloads/EN/BSI/Grundschutz/download/threats_catalogue.pdf  58  “ENISA Annual Incident Reports 2013”, http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and- CIIP/Incidents-reporting/annual-reports/annual-incident-reports-2013/at_download/fullReport  59 “Threats Catalogue – Elementary Threats”,  https://www.bsi.bund.de/SharedDocs/Downloads/EN/BSI/Grundschutz/download/threats_catalogue.pdf?__b lob=publicationFile  60 “Application Misconfiguration”,  http://projects.webappsec.org/w/page/13246914/Application%20Misconfiguration  http://www.gartner.com/newsroom/id/2344217 http://www.darkreading.com/attacks-breaches/ddos-attack-used-headless-browsers-in-150-hour-siege/d/d-id/1140696? http://www.darkreading.com/attacks-breaches/ddos-attack-used-headless-browsers-in-150-hour-siege/d/d-id/1140696? https://www.bsi.bund.de/SharedDocs/Downloads/EN/BSI/Grundschutz/download/threats_catalogue.pdf http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/Incidents-reporting/annual-reports/annual-incident-reports-2013/at_download/fullReport http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/Incidents-reporting/annual-reports/annual-incident-reports-2013/at_download/fullReport https://www.bsi.bund.de/SharedDocs/Downloads/EN/BSI/Grundschutz/download/threats_catalogue.pdf?__blob=publicationFile https://www.bsi.bund.de/SharedDocs/Downloads/EN/BSI/Grundschutz/download/threats_catalogue.pdf?__blob=publicationFile http://projects.webappsec.org/w/page/13246914/Application%20Misconfiguration  Threat Landscape and Good Practice Guide for Internet Infrastructure  January 2015  Page  17  Threat Type: Nefarious activity/Abuse Trend: Increasing 6  Threat: Malware and viruses  Malware, short for malicious software, is a generic term for any program with the intention of  disrupting computer operation, gathering sensitive information or gaining access to private  computer systems. It encompasses, among others, viruses, worms, trojans, rootkits, botnets,  spyware, scareware, or rogueware.61 62  Threat: Brute force  Brute force attacks are often used to defeat a cryptographic scheme, such as those secured by  passwords. Hackers use computer programs to try a very large number of passwords to decrypt the  message or access the system.63  Threat: Social engineering  Social engineering is the psychological manipulation of human behavior to breach security without  the participants (or victims) even realizing they have been manipulated. There are two main  categories under which all social engineering attempts could be classified – computer- or  technology-based deception, and human-based deception. The technology-based approach is to  deceive the user into believing he is interacting with the ‘real’ computer system and get him to  provide confidential information. The human approach is done through deception, by taking  advantage of the victim’s ignorance and the natural human inclination to be helpful and liked.64  Threat: Data breach  A data breach refers to the exfiltration of data from a system without the knowledge or consent of  its owner. This data resides in the targeted organization’s systems or networks and is proprietary or  sensitive in nature. Propriety data may be valuable or confidential in nature to an organization.  Acquisition by external parties may cause harm. This data can comprise personally identifiable  information, customer data, trade secrets and the like.65  Threat Type: Eavesdropping/Interception/Hijacking  Trend: Increasing 66  Threat: Espionage  Espionage is a process that involves human sources or technical means to obtain information that  normally is not publicly available.67  4.3 Summary of threat trends  This section sums up the trends for each threat type presented in the previous section. The general  tendency denotes an increase for the majority of threats, as presented in Table 4.  61 Y.

An increasing trend denotes a greater number of occurrence this year  compared to the previous year, even though the number of attacks can be low. An increasing trend  for this can of threats should be an incentive to monitor potential attacks in the future.  On another hand, a decreasing trend for Important Specific Threat does not diminish the importance  of this threat. In the table, DNS Threat is decreasing. Yet, the number of cyber attacks targeting DNS  remains important in relation to the total number of attacks. This decreasing trend shall only denote  a diminution of DNS as an attack vector by threat agents.

The association between  the assets from Figure 3 and the threats from Figure 4 is established for every threat type. An  interested reader can identify relevant threats based on its deployed assets. Table 5 matches a  selection of given threats with the assets types involved. Annex D proposes a more exhaustive list of  threats and their relevant assets.  The information depicted within the table are arranged as follows:   Threat types: This column states the threat types.   Threats: This field contains more detailed threats which belong to the different threat types.   Asset types: This field specifies by the threats and threat types exposed asset types.

Once  again, this study only yields a generic overview because of the lack of a concrete implementation.  For Internet infrastructure asset owners, it is crucial to be aware of which threats emerge from  which threat agent group. Table 6 presents such an overview.  However, this study does not develop a new glossary on threat agents within the IITL, but rather  utilises the ENISA Threat Landscape 2013’s consolidation of several publications.68 69 70 71 72 73 74  Interested readers may find a detailed description in ENISA’s Threat Landscape 2013.6 The  classification of threat agents is as follows:   Corporations   Hacktivists   Cyber criminals   Cyber terrorists   Script kiddies   Online social hackers   Employees   Nation states  Based on the threat agents the threats are assigned to relevant threat types (cf. Table 6). A detailed  overview covering not only the threat types is given in Annex E.

Therefore, different sources  with recommendations and good practices published by major Internet institutions or working  groups such as ICANN, IETF, RIPE, Euro-IX, and Internet Society are reviewed, summarised, and  mapped to the previously identified important specific threats. This tool enables asset owners to  carefully analyse their infrastructure and adopt appropriate good practices. The entire list inducing  all references can be found in Annex F.  A central design principle of the Internet, as a collection of networks, is shared responsibility. Every  participant should be conscious that their own security also depends on the security of neighbouring  networks. Hence, it is a collective responsibility to implement good practices when deemed useful  for their own security, and for the security of other parties when applicable. An example is  insufficiently configured DNS or NTP servers that are used by adversaries to amplify DDoS attacks.  One must be are aware of the fact that the given list is not exhaustive. However, in order to ensure a  certain level of quality, the list has been reviewed by acknowledged experts in the field and the  ENISA Internet Infrastructure Security and Resilience Reference Group.8  Table 7 contains the identified good practices and gives more details regarding the gap analysis. It  does not present good practices for “Generic Threats” which are, as their name implies, too generic  to be addressed by specific good practices. The table is structured as follows:   Important specific threat groups: A line with a grey background which contains the  important specific threat groups defined in section 4.2.   Threats: Here are the concrete threats, grouped according to the previous column, which  denote the actual threats which should be countered by applying the good practices.   Good practices: The actual good practices for the threat in the same row. The description is  a summary of different sources which are referenced in Annex F.   Assets, assets covered: All assets related to an important specific threat group are printed in  black. In the rows of the concrete threats, all assets covered by at least one measure are  printed in green.   Gap (assets not covered): This column contains the assets related to a threat which are not  covered by the associated good practice, printed in black. If an asset is not covered by at  least one good practice within the distinct threat group, this asset is printed in red to  highlight it as a gap for the threat type.

Chapter 3) endangered by a specific important threat. This gap analysis clearly outlines  existing shortcomings of this study, which are tackled by recommendations (cf. Chapter 8).  The summarised results of the gap analysis presented in Table 7 are that for most important specific  threats publicly available good practices are on hand. The gaps found for every threat group are as  follows:  Routing Threats   AS hijacking  Gap found: Administrators  Administrators are human resources responsible to define routing rules and security levels.  For instance, they define the filters applicable to BGP announcements and monitor the  status of BGP. Administrators of an Internet infrastructure are usually in direct relationship  with administrators of other (peer) networks and cooperate closely with them.  Available good practices for routing cover technical aspects related to filtering and  monitoring. However, no good practice exists today that prevents an administrator to define  rules that impact routing in a bad way, either at local or a more global scale.  Moreover, administrators ensure the security of routing by monitoring the status of their  routing system used (e.g,, BGP) and defining actions to take in case of an incident. However,  there is currently no good practice available that clearly focuses on how to handle routing  incidents between different networks. Indeed, such incidents are often resolved by  contacting other administrators on an ad-hoc basis.  This gap calls for the development of good practices that shall enhance the collaboration between  administrators, with the objective to secure routing and handle incidents.  DNS Threats   DNS Spoofing  Gap found: Administrators  Similarly to routing, administrators are responsible for DNS security. However, spoofing can  be performed when administrators fail at securing certain vulnerable assets (e.g., configure  a DNS server in a secure way) in their infrastructure. For that purpose, administrators may  need to perform an overview of their current security level and evaluate the assets to cover  with good practices.  As previously, there is a need of collaboration in the community especially as DNS is  distributed system with many different organisations involved. Indeed, spoofing can be  mitigated when administrators of Internet infrastructure exchange with their peers to  prevent, detect and overcome incidents.   DNS Poisoning  Gap found: Administrators  This gap is identical to the one found for administrator in the threat “DNS Spoofing”. The  conclusions are identical.  Threat Landscape and Good Practice Guide for Internet Infrastructure  January 2015  Page  27  Gap found: Operators  Operators of DNS infrastructures are reponsible to develop security rules that administrators  can apply to Internet infrastructure assets. However, humans are not immune to mistakes.  Moreover, the effect of certain technical security rule may differ depending on the  specificities of a given Internet infrastructure.  This gap can be mitigated by evaluating the application of good practices in the protection of  the Internet infrastructure. Operators can also report on the application of good practices to  their particular infrastructure, in order to benefit the community.   Denial of Service / Flooding  Gap found: System configuration  System configuration should ensure the application of a security policy. However, depending  on the values of certain parameters and the specificities of the Internet Infrastructure, it  may lead to different outcomes.  No good practice exists today to ensure protection against Denial of Service /  Flooding  by  defining a system configuration for a given Internet infrastructure asset.  In order to validate the good usage of system configuration and improve security, the  community can share experience on the configuration used to secure their Internet  infrastructure, by focusing on specific use cases.  Gap found: Essential addressing protocols  In the majority of Denial of Service / Flooding cases, essential addressing protocols are  spoofed when the protocol permits it (e.g., IP source addresses in UDP packets). Also, if  essential addressing protocols are not spoofed the difference from flooding and a high rate  of regular requests are difficult to tell for machines as it requires an understanding of  purpose. In that regard, no existing good practice exist to prevent this structural issue.  This gap can be covered by evaluating specific security measures to protect connected  devices. Moreover, migration toward more secured protocols can mitigate this threat to a  certain extent.  Gap found: Administrators  This gap is identical to the one found for the threat groups “Routing” and “DNS”. The  conclusions are identical.  Gap found: Operators  This gap is identical to the gap found for the threat groups “Routing” and “DNS”. The  conclusions are identical.  For every threat group, the human resources asset types are inadequately covered. This is probably  due to the technical focus of the reviewed material. Hence, it is advisable for asset owners to  consider the human factor, besides the technical good practices, in their security strategy.  Additionally, the good practices do not cover the threat flooding for the assets System configuration  and, Application protocols. This results from a more structural issue. Flooding exploits sheer data  volume to disrupt a system or service, hence misconfiguration or outdated protocols are not  necessarily a precondition. Thus, the considered good practices do not describe counter measures.  Threat Landscape and Good Practice Guide for Internet Infrastructure  January 2015  Page  28  8 Recommendations  Based on the insights gained within this study recommendations for understanding and improving  the security of the Internet infrastructure are listed in this section. Therefore, the stock taken assets  and threats are condensed to important specific threat groups of the Internet Infrastructure. On this  foundation and additional input of experts on good practices have been collected and summarised.  The following gap analysis yields a number of assets that cannot be covered by at least one good  practice. In order to provide information for the protection of not adequately covered assets, a set  of recommendations has been developed. Finally, the recommendations were reviewed by ENISA  experts and the reference group for Internet Infrastructure Security and Resilience.17  The list of recommendations is divided into technical (Section 8.1) and organisational (Section 8.2)  guidance to address particular target audiences. They may be considered by relevant stakeholders  such as standardization bodies (e.g., IETF, ICANN), industry, and academia.  One must be aware of the fact that no list of good practices and recommendations can be  exhaustive nor is it feasible to maintain a list of all possible protection measures. It is important to  raise the bar high enough to provide a baseline security at the very least.  The scope of this study is the Internet infrastructure; this study strongly advocates depending on the  core business of a company, the implementation and tailoring of the good practices for routing, DNS,  and DDoS mitigation listed in Chapter 7. Additionally, it should be kept in mind that hardware  vendors for core Internet devices such as routers or switches frequently release guidelines for their  safe and sound configuration (cf. documents mentioned in Chapter 7).  8.1 Technical Recommendations  The recommendations presented in this subsection should be considered as guidance to technical  staff such as operators or administrators. The implementation of the listed measures should be  prioritised by the results of risk assessments.  Recommendation 1: For Internet Infrastructure owners and electronic communications network  regulatory agencies, evaluate your current level of security by understanding the assets covered  (and not covered) by existing security measures.  Having a holistic view on the assets that have to be secured is the basis in making sure security  measures are applied effectively. So, the first step for each Internet infrastructure owner and  electronic communications network regulatory agency is to start with an analysis of existing (and  planned) assets in order to understand existing or potential threats.  Internet infrastructure owners should evaluate how current security measures mitigate the threats  applicable to these identified assets. In particular, they could focus on Important Specific Threats  linked to Routing, DNS and Denial of Service.  This recommendation aims to close the following gaps:   Routing Threats: Administrators   DNS Spoofing: Administrators   DNS Poisoning: Administrators, Operators   Denial of Service / Flooding: Administrators, Operators  Threat Landscape and Good Practice Guide for Internet Infrastructure  January 2015  Page  29  Recommendation 2: For Internet infrastructure owners, evaluate the application of adapted good  practices in a focused manner.  Internet infrastructure owners should generally consider making use of recommendations of  community driven, well-known open standards organisations such as IETF, Internet Society, Euro-IX  or RIPE. They should also take vendor-specific recommendations into account to secure the  organisation’s hardware and software infrastructure throughout its entire life cycle.  Internet infrastructure owners need to define which measures to apply, and how to deploy them, in  order to enhance the security of individual assets and of their entire system. For instance, they could  prioritise specific security measures by giving more attention to the threats they face. For that  purpose, they can rely on monitoring for example.  This applies to recommendations for technical details such as device configuration or software  development as well as to organisational structures like the securing of business processes and  performing risk assessment.  This recommendation aims to close the following gaps:   Routing Threats: Administrators   DNS Spoofing: Administrators   DNS Poisoning: Administrators, Operators   Denial of Service / Flooding: System configuration, Essential addressing protocols,  Administrators, Operators  Recommendation 3: For Internet infrastructure owners, cooperate with the community to  exchange on threats and promote the application of good practices as mitigation measures.  Internet infrastructure owners need to establish better coordination in the area of Internet  infrastructure security. Security processes and measures at a local, as well as on a larger scale,  require coordination for effective mitigation on technical and operational levels. It also includes the  assignment of responsible personnel and the building of regional, national, and multi-national  communities of trust and information exchange platforms.  The exchange of confidential information can occur:   On the basis of trust;75 since the disclosure of incidents may have a negative impact on the  reputation;   Through regulation and legal obligations, as it exists through Article 13a of EU Directive  2009/140/EC;76   Via Information Sharing and Analysis Centres (ISAC).77  It is also important to commit to participating, this ensures that other organisations experience the  application in practice and may follow suit.  Moreover, such cooperation is beneficial to enhance the security level of the Internet. It shall help  understanding the pre-requisites and challenges linked to the deployment of good practices by  75 http://www.terena.org/news/fullstory.php?news_id=2666  76  “Article 13a of EU Directive 2009/140/EC”, https://ec.europa.eu/digital-agenda/sites/digital- agenda/files/Copy%20of%20Regulatory%20Framework%20for%20Electonic%20Communications%202013%20 NO%20CROPS.pdf  77 “Financial Services Information Sharing and Anlysis Center”, https://www.fsisac.com  http://www.terena.org/news/fullstory.php?news_id=2666 https://ec.europa.eu/digital-agenda/sites/digital-agenda/files/Copy%20of%20Regulatory%20Framework%20for%20Electonic%20Communications%202013%20NO%20CROPS.pdf https://ec.europa.eu/digital-agenda/sites/digital-agenda/files/Copy%20of%20Regulatory%20Framework%20for%20Electonic%20Communications%202013%20NO%20CROPS.pdf https://ec.europa.eu/digital-agenda/sites/digital-agenda/files/Copy%20of%20Regulatory%20Framework%20for%20Electonic%20Communications%202013%20NO%20CROPS.pdf https://www.fsisac.com/  Threat Landscape and Good Practice Guide for Internet Infrastructure  January 2015  Page  30  Internet infrastructure owners. It can also lead to the development of new (community-driven) good  practices to cover emerging threats.   Routing Threats: Administrators   DNS Spoofing: Administrators   DNS Poisoning: Administrators, Operators   Denial of Service / Flooding: System configuration, Essential addressing protocols,  Administrators, Operators  Recommendation 4: For users deploying good practices guides, report on their implementations,  assets covered and gaps found.  For organisations that want to apply existing good practices it is of great help if the good practice  guides shows a list of successful implementations. If this list contains well-known names, the  importance of the good practices is stressed. Also, the organisation that is about to apply the  security measures described in the good practices can contact the other organisations that already  successfully applied the security measures in order to discuss open questions.  For that purpose, it is recommended that organisations deploying good practices report to their  authors inconsistencies, for example cases where the good practice is not directly applicable due to  a very specific Internet infrastructure. In relation with recommendation 3, this exchange of  information can be realised through a community-driven platform.  Moreover, developers of good practices could also highlight the assets covered by the security  measures described and which gaps still exist. This helps organisations applying the security  measures described in the good practice guide to easily understand which assets are covered and  which assets are still untouched.  This recommendation aims to close the following gaps:   Routing Threats: Administrators   DNS Spoofing: Administrators   DNS Poisoning: Administrators, Operators   Denial of Service / Flooding: System configuration, Administrators, Operators  Recommendation 5: Words matter: Ensure the right use of terms and definitions.  For a community within the same domain it is advisable to make use of the same terminology. This  will improve the comprehensibility of written material and help in discussing related topics. Among  others the RFC 494978 provides a set of security terms and definitions.  This recommendation aims to close the following gaps:   Routing Threats: Administrators   DNS Spoofing: Administrators   DNS Poisoning: Administrators, Operators   Denial of Service / Flooding: Administrators, Operators  78 http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4949  http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4949  Threat Landscape and Good Practice Guide for Internet Infrastructure  January 2015  Page  31  8.2 Organisational Recommendations  The organisational recommendations are to be understood and implemented by responsible  management staff and focus on defining operational procedures and processes.  Recommendation 6: For Internet infrastructure owners, use proper risk assessment methods to  understand vulnerable assets in your Internet infrastructure and prioritise your protection actions.  It is advisable that Internet infrastructure owners prioritise actions to protect their Internet  infrastructure. However, only a risk assessment will expose reliable figures about the probability of  potential loss, also denoted as risk. Identified gaps may be covered by implementing measures  presented in the chapter on good practices (cf. Section 7).  This recommendation aims to close the following gaps:   Routing Threats: Administrators   DNS Spoofing: Administrators   DNS Poisoning: Administrators, Operators   Denial of Service / Flooding: System configuration, Essential addressing protocols,  Administrators, Operators, Administrators, Operators  Recommendation 7: Build an information and communication technology security awareness and  training program.  An ICT training program is crucial for the security of the Internet infrastructure in every company.  The content and scope of the program must be tied to existing security directives and established  policies. Further, it must cover all positions within a company and should distinguish between  general security training in order to raise awareness, and special programs tailored to the specific  roles of experts. A basic understanding of security can be obtained with a comprehensive  certification scheme. Nonetheless, it is important to state that although certification is a valuable  building block, it is indeed not a solution to absolutely rely on. Frequent activities ensure practice  readiness and should include extensive debriefing sessions to discuss the lessons learned.  This recommendation aims to close the following gaps:   Routing Threats: Administrators   DNS Spoofing: Administrators   DNS Poisoning: Administrators, Operators   Denial of Service / Flooding: System configuration, Essential addressing protocols,  Administrators, Operators  Recommendation 8: Internet infrastructure owners shall commit third-party vendors to apply  security measures.  Internet infrastructure owners should recommend that the vendor follows certain rules,  recommendations, or certifications in line with their architecture or business model. Those rules  should be defined as a part of the asset owner’s risk assessment under the supervision of the  company’s security personnel. This ensures an extended impact of recommendations and will  improve security sustainable.  This recommendation aims to close the following gaps:   Routing Threats: Administrators   DNS Spoofing: Administrators   DNS Poisoning: Administrators, Operators  Threat Landscape and Good Practice Guide for Internet Infrastructure  January 2015  Page  32   Denial of Service / Flooding: System configuration, Essential addressing protocols,  Administrators, Operators  Recommendation 9: Stay current on any updates.  Stay current on protocol and specification updates, and evaluate the prompt implementation within  your own infrastructure and systems. This can be achieved through participation at conferences and  workshops or simply by subscribing to mailing lists or journals. Practical experience shows that in  many cases updated protocols or specification are available but simply not, or only inadequately,  implemented.  This recommendation aims to close the following gaps:   Routing Threats: Administrators   DNS Spoofing: Administrators   DNS Poisoning: Administrators, Operators   Denial of Service / Flooding: System configuration, Essential addressing protocols,  Administrators, Operators  Threat Landscape and Good Practice Guide for Internet Infrastructure  January 2015  Page  33  9 Conclusion  This Threat Landscape and Good Practice Guide for Internet Infrastructure shall permit Internet  infrastructure owners to secure their assets against important and emerging threats.  For that purpose, this study has classified assets and threats of the Internet infrastructure into mind  maps. It has highlighted the assets involved in Important Specific Threats, which comprise Routing  threats, DNS threats, Denial of Service and Generic threats. Moreover, threats agents, who are at the  origin of the threat, have also mapped for every threat type.  For every Important Specific Threat, trends are evaluated, based on public information: the threat  level is globally increasing at the exception of DNS threats, in decrease (although, the number of  attacks remains elevated).  For each Important Specific Threat, the study details a list of existing good practices that aim at  mitigating these threats. The good practices are associated with the list of assets covered and those  uncovered.  Based on the list of uncovered assets, a gap analysis in performed. It enhances the lack of good  practices addressing the threats linked to human resources (administrators and operators), system  configuration and essential addressing protocols.  Finally, a list of five technical and four organisational recommendations is proposed to improve the  security of the Internet infrastructure. Moreover, Internet infrastructure owners can reuse or adapt  the tools proposed in this study (e.g. mind maps, matrix linking threats and assets, matrix linked  threats and threat agents) to evaluate their level of exposure to current threats. They can also  evaluate (or improve) their current security measures for every assets linked to these threats.  Threat Landscape and Good Practice Guide for Internet Infrastructure  January 2015  Page  34  Description of Internet Infrastructure Assets  This section describes the different groups of the “Internet Infrastructure Assets” taxonomy,  represented by the mind map in Figure 3 and detailed in Annex B. The description does not cover  the full mind map, as this would be going beyond the purpose of this study. This study focus on the  assets of the mind map which are of special interest for the threat analysis and the best common  practice coverage.  Protocols  A protocol is a set of digital rules for data exchange within or between computer systems. Protocols  are valuable assets for the Internet infrastructure because they allow meaningful communication  between different computer systems:   Essential addressing protocols: Essential addressing protocols (e.g., ARP, IPv4, IPv6, DNS) are  used to address one or a group of computer systems in a network. Another set of essential  addressing protocols such as TCP and UDP allow addressing of a particular executable  program running on a single computer system.   Routing protocols: A routing protocol is a set of rules used by routers to determine the most  appropriate paths into which they should forward packets towards their intended final  destinations. To route data within an Internet provider’s own network protocols such as RIP,  MPLS, or OSPF are typically used. Between different Internet providers the routing protocol  BGP is usually employed to exchange routing paths. Routing protocols rely on essential  addressing protocols.   Connectivity protocols: If different essential addressing protocols are used and  communication between these different worlds should be provided, connectivity protocols  can be applied. For instance, to enable IPv6-based communication on an IPv4 network, the  protocol 6to4 can be used. Another example is NAT, which allows the hiding of a network of  unroutable IPv4 addresses behind a single IP address and enabling limited Internet  connectivity.   Application protocols: Executable programs define their own task dependent protocols (e.g.,  HTTP, FTP, or SMTP) to exchange data.  Security protocols: Security protocols are a particular set of digital rules that ensure the  protection of data by applying cryptographic primitives such as signing and encrypting.  Security protocols typically wrap existing application protocols (e.g., HTTPS, FTPS, IMAPS) or  enhance existing protocols (e.g., IPsec, DNSSec).  Services  A service, with regards to the Internet infrastructure, refers to an abstract combination of other  functionalities utilizing other assets in order to fulfil a defined task. Services are important, as  without services the concept of the Internet is of no use. Services can be structured as follows:   Essential addressing: For the different layers of the Internet Protocol Stack addressing  concepts exist which are described in the following section:  o Link layer addressing: For the link layer typically the Ethernet protocol is used which  relies on so-called MAC addresses. The MAC addresses are distinct numbers  assigned to networking hardware devices. Ranges of numbers are managed and  assigned to hardware manufactures by the IEEE.  o Internet Protocol addressing: The Internet Protocol is the principal communication  protocol of the Internet. A unique address is assigned to any communication  participant in order to transmit information through the entire Internet to a defined  Threat Landscape and Good Practice Guide for Internet Infrastructure  January 2015  Page  35  destination. The address space is maintained by IANA, which gives address space to  the various “Regional Internet Registries” (RIRs) (cf. Routing). The RIRs themselves  split up their given address spaces and distribute them to the “Local Internet  Registries” (LIRs). LIRs allocate their customers (e.g., end users or companies) the  given address space in the Internet.  o Transport protocol addressing: The transport protocols provide end-to-end  communication services to software programs of dissimilar hosts. It adds an  abstraction layer onto the Internet Protocol addressing and distinguishes between  different applications on the same host by assigning unique numbers, so-called  ports. These port numbers are maintained by the IANA. Prominent protocols are TCP  and UDP.  o Domain Name System: The domain name system is responsible for translating easily- memorable domain names (e.g., enisa.europa.eu) to numeric Internet Protocol  addresses. Domain names are managed by domain name registrars, which are  organised under a hierarchy headed by the IANA.  o Addressing Unit: In general, for addressing resources in the Internet, the so-called  Uniform Resource Indicators (URIs) are used. The syntax of URIs is as follows: It  starts with a protocol of how the resource can be accessed, followed by a colon and  two slashes, followed by an Internet Protocol address or a domain name, followed  by an optional colon and port number, and finishes with the full path to the  resource. For example:  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/@@search?SearchableText=enisa   Routing: Routing is the process of selecting best paths between two points of  communication in a network. Administrative instances of the routing service, which are  often called \"Regional Internet Registries\" (e.g., RIPE NCC, LACNIC, APNIC, ARIN, AfriNIC)  map network identifiers, so-called autonomous system numbers, to organizations (e.g.,  companies or government entities) which are participating on the Internet.   Applications: Application communication, such as electronic mail or file transfer, relies on  protocols that are implemented by software (e.g., executable programs) in order to provide  a service to end users or machines.   Security: Security services aim to maintain the security goals confidentiality, integrity,  availability, authenticity, and non-repudiation.  Hardware  Hardware is defined as physical components of computer systems such as machines or wiring.  Without hardware no software can be executed or information stored, hence hardware is a valuable  asset. For the Internet infrastructure they are grouped into three categories:   Network devices: Equipment facilitating the use of computer networks are called network  devices. For instance, switches forward frames based on layer 2 addresses, routers utilise  layer 3 addresses to forward packets, firewalls filter network data based on pre-defined  rules, and bridges combine different network segments.   Servers: A server is a computer system that provides services to other computers or users by  running executable programs.   Personal terminals: A personal terminal is an electronic hardware device used for  communication with other computer systems.  Threat Landscape and Good Practice Guide for Internet Infrastructure  January 2015  Page  36  Interconnection  As the Internet is a network of different large computer networks, the assets providing  interconnection functionality are very valuable. Two different kinds of organisations can be defined:   Generic Internet provider: A generic Internet provider is an organization that provides  services for accessing the Internet. Generic Internet providers may be organised in various  forms, such as commercial, community owned, non-profit, or otherwise privately owned.  Internet providers specialise in the kind of service they provide: Data centre operators and  server providers run data centres and rent space or servers respectively. Internet access  providers employ a range of technologies (e.g., Wi-Fi, copper or fibre cables) to connect  users to their network. Backbone providers usually run a larger network and provide  Internet connectivity to Internet access providers, data centres, and server providers.   Internet exchange point: An Internet exchange point consists mainly of one or more switches  to interconnect different Internet providers, in order to exchange Internet traffic between  their networks.  Software  Software is a generic term for collections of computer data and instructions in order to manage  information and store new information, provide access to information, and process it. Software is of  special importance because hardware is often useless without software, and services are built on  top of software. Software can be structured as follows:   Operating systems: Operating systems provide the basic non-task-specific function of  computers. Operating systems are responsible for controlling, integrating, and managing the  individual hardware components of a computer system by relying on device drivers and  firmware so that other task-specific software and users can easily interact with the system.   Device drivers: A device driver is a computer program that operates or controls a particular  type of device that is attached to or integrated into a computer, by talking to the device’s  firmware. Device drivers are often considered to be part of an operating system because  they interact closely with it.   Firmware: The term firmware describes a combination of persistent memory, program code,  and data stored within it. The persistent memory is part of a particular hardware component  (e.g., a line card of a router). A device driver usually communicates with the firmware of a  particular hardware component in order to control or manage it.   Executable programs: A piece of software that is designed to fulfil a particular purpose is  called an executable program. Executable programs require an operating system in order to  be executed.  Infrastructure  The term infrastructure denotes the basic physical structures and facilities (e.g., buildings and  cables) needed for the operation of the Internet. In order to build a worldwide network of networks,  the so-called Internet, the supporting infrastructure is crucial. It can be grouped as follows:   Cabling and linking: Cables and other links are used to interconnect networking devices or  networks. Customarily, those connections are either wired or wireless links.  Miscellaneous types of cable links like copper or fibre are used depending on the network  bandwidth, size, or performance requirements and contingent upon environmental  constraints such as undersea cables, underground cables, or above-ground cables. If the  deployment of physical connections is not feasible or inefficient, wireless links can be  employed instead. Such technologies include Wi-Fi, WiMAX, or LTE.  Threat Landscape and Good Practice Guide for Internet Infrastructure  January 2015  Page  37   Buildings: Buildings are facilities that house assets such as hardware, software, and  interconnection. This ranges from special purpose facilities like landing points where  undersea cables land ashore, to multi-purpose data centres that are used to house all kinds  of hardware and infrastructure.   Power supply: A power supply is a system that supplies electrical energy.   Cooling systems: A cooling system regulates the temperature and humidity properties of air  in order ensure the proper operation of computer systems.   Physical security: Physical security refers to measures that deny unauthorised access to  infrastructure. These measures include but are not limited to fences, walls, and doors.  Information  Information is perception derived from the collection of data. Information is a valuable asset  because systems (e.g., software, hardware, services) and human resources depend on it to make  reasonable decisions. The information assets identified are grouped as follows:   Inventory of hardware, software, infrastructure, information: A list of detailed information  about hardware, software, infrastructure components, and important information such as  configurations. The detailed information may contain the version of the item, the place  where it is located, and invoices, but is not limited to this.   Historical information/statistics: Historical information is information which was collected in  the past and can be accessed in the present. Some kinds of historical information may only  be collected in accordance with the law, other kinds are collected in order to create statistics  on such topics as usage or who has accessed the resource.   Trending information: Attempting to identify trends in the information collected is often  used to predict the future based on past events or behaviour.   Network topology: Network topology is the arrangement of various components (e.g.,  routers, switches, firewalls, servers) of a computer network. Such details may be filed as  network maps or routing tables.   System configuration: System configuration describes how different components (e.g.,  software, hardware) of a system (e.g., software, hardware, services) are configured,  connected, and interoperate in order to achieve a certain goal. For instance, the router MAC  and IP addresses configure its network subsystem.   Operational information: Information that is needed to operate a system is called  operational information. Operational information comprises the status of a system,  measures for certain metrics, events when the state of a system changes, alerts when a  certain threshold for particular metric is reached, and information about shortages or  disturbances.   Credentials: A credential is an attestation of authority issued to a machine or person by a  third party. It might be physical, such as keys and passports, or virtual (e.g. usernames and  passwords, PINs).   User rights policies: User rights policies define the permissions of groups of users (e.g.,  administrators, operators) to certain information (such as computer systems, executable  programs, information).   Lawful interception: Lawful interception is obtaining access to communications network data  pursuant to lawful authority for the purpose of analysis, evidence, or surveillance.  Human Resources  This section defines the personnel which are considered to be a significant asset of the Internet  infrastructure in terms of skills and abilities.  Threat Landscape and Good Practice Guide for Internet Infrastructure  January 2015  Page  38   Administrators: A person that is responsible for setting up, configuring, monitoring, and  maintaining a system (e.g., server, router).   Operators: A person or a company that runs software, machines, or systems.   Support team: A person or a group that provides help on the usage, configuration, or fault  detection of a system or service.   Developers: A person concerned with researching, designing, implementing, and testing of  systems or software.   Managers: A person that is responsible for controlling or administering an organization or  group of staff (e.g., administrators, operators, developers).   Trainers: A person that educates another person on a specific topic.   Auditors: A person that validates and verifies that a person, process, or system, behaves,  runs, or is being used in an environment as previously defined.   End users: A person who actually uses a particular product or service.

In particular RPKI is used  to secure BGP through BGPSec.113 114   Establish an Appropriate Use Policy (AUP) as explained in BCP 46, which promotes rules to  secure peering115.   Establish ingress filtering from the edge site to the Internet.112 116 117   Establish Unicast Reverse Path Forwarding to verify the validity of a source IP address.118 119   Establish egress filtering at the boundary router to proactively filter all traffic going to the  customer that has a source address of any of the addresses that have been assigned to that  customer.112   Filter the routing announcements and implement techniques that reduce the risk of putting  excessive load on routing generated by illegitimated route updates/announcements.112 117  For instance, Route Flap Damping (RFD) with a well-defined threshold may contribute to  reducing router processing time.118 119   Registry databases such as IRR, APNIC, ARIN, and RIPE have to be subject to continuous  maintenance. This shall allow usage of updated information to secure peering.112 120 For  example, the “Route Object” field can help validating routes received from peers.112 121 122 123   Configuration updates for the routing infrastructure may only be performed by a defined  authority using strong authentication.112   Monitor the status of BGP to detect unusual behaviour such as path changes or unusual  announcement.123  112 “A Forensic Case Study on AS Hijacking: The Attacker’s Perspective”, Sigcomm CCR 2013,  http://www.sigcomm.org/sites/default/files/ccr/papers/2013/April/2479957-2479959.pdf  113 “Use Cases and Interpretations of Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI) Objects for Issuers and Relying  Parties”, RFC 6907, http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6907  114 “Origin Validation Operation Based on the Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI)”, http://www.rfc- editor.org/bcp/bcp185.txt  115  ”Recommended Internet Service Provider Security Services and Procedures”, Section Network  Infrastructure, http://www.rfc-editor.org/bcp/bcp46.txt  116 “BGP operations and security”, http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-opsec-bgp-security-04  117 “RIPE Anti-Spoofing Task Force HOW-TO” (RIPE-431), http://www.ripe.net/ripe/docs/ripe-431  118 “BGP Route Flap Damping”, http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2439  119 “RIPE: Recommendations on Route Flap Damping”, http://www.ripe.net/ripe/docs/ripe-580  120 “Collective Responsibility and Collaboration for Routing Resilience and Security”,  https://www.routingmanifesto.org  121 “APNIC: Routing object”, http://www.apnic.net/apnic-info/whois_search/about/what-is-in- whois/IRR/routing-objects  122  “RIPE: Managing ROAs”, http://www.ripe.net/lir-services/resource-management/certification/resource- certification-roa-management  123 “BGP Operations and Security”, http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-opsec-bgp-security-05  http://www.sigcomm.org/sites/default/files/ccr/papers/2013/April/2479957-2479959.pdf http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6907 http://www.rfc-editor.org/bcp/bcp185.txt http://www.rfc-editor.org/bcp/bcp185.txt http://www.rfc-editor.org/bcp/bcp46.txt http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-opsec-bgp-security-04 http://www.ripe.net/ripe/docs/ripe-431 http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2439 http://www.ripe.net/ripe/docs/ripe-580 https://www.routingmanifesto.org/ http://www.apnic.net/apnic-info/whois_search/about/what-is-in-whois/IRR/routing-objects http://www.apnic.net/apnic-info/whois_search/about/what-is-in-whois/IRR/routing-objects http://www.ripe.net/lir-services/resource-management/certification/resource-certification-roa-management http://www.ripe.net/lir-services/resource-management/certification/resource-certification-roa-management http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-opsec-bgp-security-05  Threat Landscape and Good Practice Guide for Internet Infrastructure  January 2015  Page  58  Route leaks:   Configure BGP maximum-prefix to ensure the validity of routes announced. If more prefixes  are received, it is sign of an incorrect behaviour and the BGP session shuts down.124 125 126   Utilise resource certification (RPKI) to provide AS origin validation.113 114  BGP session hijacking:   Establish prefix filtering and automation of prefix filters.114 118 122   Employ AS path filtering.116   Use TCP-AO (TCP-Authentication Option) to secure BGP Authentication in order to replace  TCP-MD5. TCP-AO simplifies the exchange of keys.126 127  DNS Threats  DNS registrar hijacking:   Registrants must protect account credentials and define authorised users, while registrars  have to provide a secure authentication process.128 129   Registrants should take advantage of routine correspondence from registrar such as change  notification, billing information, or WHOIS records. Hence, registrars must provide such  information.128 129   Registrants should maintain documentation to “prove registration”.128   Registrants should use separate identities for registrant, technical, administrative, and billing  contacts. Thus, registrars need to allow a more complex user rights management.128 129   Registrars must establish an effective zone data management.128   Registrars should consider supporting DNSSEC.128 129 130   Registrars may monitor DNS change activities.128  DNS spoofing:   Deploying DNSSEC aims to secure DNS clients (resolvers) origin authentication of DNS data,  authenticated denial of existence, and data integrity.131 132  DNS poisoning:   Deploying DNSSEC aims to secure DNS clients (resolvers) origin authentication of DNS data,  authenticated denial of existence, and data integrity.130 131 132   Restrict zone transfers to reduce load on systems and network.133  124 “BGP Configuration best practices”, http://www.ssi.gouv.fr/IMG/pdf/NP_BGP_BCP_en.pdf  125 https://www.allianz-fuer-cybersicherheit.de/ACS/DE/_downloads/techniker/netzwerk/BSI-CS-102.pdf (in  German)  126 “BGP Operations and Security”, http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-opsec-bgp-security-06  127 “RFC 5926: Cryptographic Algorithms for the TCP Authentication Option (TCP-AO)”,  http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5926  128 “A Registrant's Guide to Protecting Domain Name Registration Accounts”,  https://www.icann.org/en/system/files/files/sac-044-en.pdf  129 “Measures to Protect Domain Registration Services Against Exploitation or Misuse”,  https://www.icann.org/en/groups/ssac/documents/sac-040-en.pdf  130 “Root Name Server Operational Requirements“, http://tools.ietf.org/html/bcp40  131  “Good practices guide for deploying DNSSEC”, http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and- CIIP/networks-and-services-resilience/dnssec/gpgdnssec  132 “Detection and countermeasure of forged response cache poisoning attacks”,  http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-fujiwara-dnsop-poisoning-measures-00  http://www.ssi.gouv.fr/IMG/pdf/NP_BGP_BCP_en.pdf https://www.allianz-fuer-cybersicherheit.de/ACS/DE/_downloads/techniker/netzwerk/BSI-CS-102.pdf http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-opsec-bgp-security-06 http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5926 https://www.icann.org/en/system/files/files/sac-044-en.pdf https://www.icann.org/en/groups/ssac/documents/sac-040-en.pdf http://tools.ietf.org/html/bcp40 http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/networks-and-services-resilience/dnssec/gpgdnssec http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/networks-and-services-resilience/dnssec/gpgdnssec http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-fujiwara-dnsop-poisoning-measures-00  Threat Landscape and Good Practice Guide for Internet Infrastructure  January 2015  Page  59   Restrict dynamic updates to only authorised sources in order to avoid misuse.133 Such misuse  include the abuse of a DNS server as an amplifier, DNS cache poisoning…   Set up the authoritative name server as non-recursive. Separate recursive name servers  from the authoritative name server.133   Allow DNS transport over TCP to support non-standard queries. Moreover, TCP may be  necessary for DNSSEC.125  Domain name collision:   Do not use random domain names that you do not own for your internal infrastructure. For  example, do not consider private domain name space as top-level domains.134   Preventing DNS request for internal namespaces to leak into the Internet by applying  firewall policies.135   Use reserved TLDs such as .test, .example, .invalid, or .localhost.135 136  Denial of Service Threats  Amplification/reflection:   Adopt source IP address verification at the edge of Internet infrastructure (close to the origin  of traffic) to prevent network address spoofing through ingress and egress filtering.137 138 139  140 141   Operators of authoritative name server operator should implement RRL (Response Rate  Limiting).137   DNS name server operators and ISPs need to disable open recursion on name servers and  may only accept DNS queries from trusted sources.137 138 140  Flooding:   Manufacturers and configurators of network equipment should take steps to secure all  devices and have to keep them up-to-date.138  133 “How to Secure a Domain Name Server (DNS)”,  http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/SMA/fasp/documents/network_security/NISTSecuringDNS/NISTSecuringDNS.htm  134 “SSAC Advisory Concerning the Mitigation of Name Collision Risk”,  https://www.icann.org/en/system/files/files/sac-062-en.pdf  135 “Name Collision Mitigation for Enterprise Networks”, Name Collision Workshop 2014,  http://namecollisions.net/downloads/wpnc14_slides_hoffman_name_collision_mitigation.pdf  136 “Reserved Top Level DNS Names”, http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2606  137 “SSAC Advisory DNS Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) Attacks”,  https://www.icann.org/en/system/files/files/dns-ddos-advisory-31mar06-en.pdf  138 “SSAC Advisory on DDoS Attacks Leveraging DNS Infrastructure”,  https://www.icann.org/en/system/files/files/sac-065-en.pdf  139 “Ingress Filtering for Multihomed Networks”, http://www.rfc-editor.org/bcp/bcp84.txt  140 “DNS: DNS Amplification Attacks”, https://www.us-cert.gov/ncas/alerts/TA13-088A  141 “Network Ingress Filtering: Defeating Denial of Service Attacks which employ IP Source Address Spoofing”,  http://www.rfc-editor.org/bcp/bcp38.txt  http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/SMA/fasp/documents/network_security/NISTSecuringDNS/NISTSecuringDNS.htm https://www.icann.org/en/system/files/files/sac-062-en.pdf http://namecollisions.net/downloads/wpnc14_slides_hoffman_name_collision_mitigation.pdf http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2606 https://www.icann.org/en/system/files/files/dns-ddos-advisory-31mar06-en.pdf https://www.icann.org/en/system/files/files/sac-065-en.pdf http://www.rfc-editor.org/bcp/bcp84.txt https://www.us-cert.gov/ncas/alerts/TA13-088A http://www.rfc-editor.org/bcp/bcp38.txt  Threat Landscape and Good Practice Guide for Internet Infrastructure  January 2015  Page  60  PO Box 1309, 710 01 Heraklion, Greece  Tel: +30 28 14 40 9710  info@enisa.europa.eu  www.enisa.europa.eu  TP -05  -14 -012  -EN -N  ENISA  European Union Agency for Network and Information Security  Science and Technology Park of Crete (ITE)  Vassilika Vouton, 700 13, Heraklion, Greece  Athens Office  1 Vass.

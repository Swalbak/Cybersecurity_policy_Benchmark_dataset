The 5G ecosystem  considered in this report is a multi-dimensional space encompassing not only technological and  functional domains, but also the related technology lifecycle processes and stakeholders.  This report focuses on standardisation from a technical and organisational perspective.  Considerations of the effectiveness of specific standards and of the strategic aspects related to  5G security, although important, are outside the scope of this report.  Accordingly, this report:  • Collects standards, specifications and guidelines1 relevant to the cybersecurity of the 5G  ecosystem that had been published, either as drafts or in their final versions, by September  2021;  • Positions them within the defined 5G ecosystem by assessing the extent to which they  address security objectives;  • Identifies gaps in standardisation by comparing the existing literature against an ideal  situation of cybersecurity robustness and resilience, where standardisation addresses the  necessary technical and organisational security aspects;  • Formulates recommendations on standardisation in the area of 5G cybersecurity.  The report collects and analyses more than 140 documents and positions them across 150  security measures. The main observations that can be derived from the analysis are the  following.  • All in all, available standards, specifications and guidelines are general. They can be applied  consistently to the 5G technical and functional domains and related lifecycle processes only  after being tailored accordingly.  • 5G-specific standards, specifications and guidelines are available to a greater extent to the  stakeholders of the telecommunication sector than for other stakeholders (e.g. audit  organisations and stakeholders in the connected devices industry).  • 5G-specific standards, specifications and guidelines cover to a greater extent the ‘run’ phase  of a technology lifecycle, whereas other phases would need tailoring.  • Existing knowledge bases on cybersecurity threats and IT-security guidelines can be used for  5G cloud native architectures and architectures relying on APIs (Application Programming  Interface). Although these families of software are well known to the IT industry, their use is  quite recent and constitute drivers of the ‘cloudification’ of the telecom sector.  • The existing literature does not allow for ‘end-to-end’ trust and resilience in the 5G ecosystem.  For example, guidelines for 5G-specific tools and key performance indicators could be needed  to ensure a common understanding of 5G protection and of end-to-end trust and resilience.  Concerning gaps in standardisation, the report finds that only the areas of governance and risk  management as well as the security of human resources present moderate gaps e.g. related to  sector-specific risk management. The other areas considered (e.g. operations management,  1 Section 2.2 explains the taxonomy used by the document. For convenience the report refers to all considered documents  alternatively as ’standards, specifications, guidelines’, ‘existing literature’, ‘reference documents’.  5G CYBERSECURITY STANDARDS  March 2022  7  business continuity management and incident management) present major gaps in  standardisation.  Still, this report recommends the adoption of a progressive approach to 5G standardisation,  which should consider several elements such as the usefulness and necessity of new standards  and their link with strategic objectives. It also notes the importance of fostering the maturity and  the completeness of the identification and assessment of risk by harmonising risk assessment  practices in a way that is inclusive of all stakeholders in the 5G ecosystem.  Finally, this report stresses that, while the technical and organisational standards analysed can  contribute to the security of 5G, they should not be treated as an exhaustive list of measures  guaranteeing security. There are risks that are not covered by standards, for example residual  risks whose cost is neither borne by nor attributable to a specific stakeholder, such as societal  risks resulting from network malfunctions. Indeed, the complexity of 5G calls for a  comprehensive vision of trust and of resilience that goes beyond standardisation. This vision  should be future-proof and not dependent on the variability of assets and configurations in the  network.  5G CYBERSECURITY STANDARDS  March 2022  8  1. INTRODUCTION  1.1 DOCUMENT PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVES  The ambition of this document is to outline the contribution of standardisation to the mitigation of  technical risks, and therefore to trust and resilience, in the 5G ecosystem. Accordingly, the  objectives of the document are:  • to provide an overview of standards, specifications and guidelines2 relevant to the  cybersecurity of the 5G ecosystem and that had been published, either as drafts or in their  final versions, by September 2021;  • to facilitate the positioning and to assess the applicability of any reference document in the 5G  security environment;  • to formulate recommendations on standardisation in the area of 5G security.  The document focuses on standardisation from a technical and organisational perspective.  Considerations of the effectiveness of specific standards and of the strategic and policy aspects  related to 5G security, although important, are outside the scope of this report.  Note on the relation to other on-going work on 5G cybersecurity carried out by ENISA: this  report is not intended to pre-conceive any work related to the drafting of the European  cybersecurity certification candidate scheme on 5G networks.  1.2 OVERVIEW AND STRUCTURE OF THE STUDY  Businesses and institutions participate in several activities concerning 5G networks and 5G- dependent processes: their design, construction, operation, introduction to the market, use,  audit and even certification. Altogether, with various degrees of importance, they contribute to  the Digital Single Market.  The EU Cybersecurity Strategy3, published in 2020, reinstates the importance of trust and  resilience in the Union, to be sustained in the long run for societal purposes and at a systemic  scale. Therefore, cybersecurity risks and the capabilities for their mitigation need to be  considered also from a systemic perspective. To this end, the analysis proposed in the report is  based on a ‘5G Ecosystem’ defined as a multi-dimensional space comprising not only 5G  technological and functional domains but also the related technology lifecycle processes and  stakeholders. The conceived ecosystem is also underpinned by a security dimension. The  ecosystem and its components are described in detail in Section 2 Scope, Definitions and  Conventions.  After having defined the ‘5G Ecosystem’, the document:  • collects existing cybersecurity standards, specifications and guidelines, and positions them  within the defined 5G ecosystem (Section 3 Positioning and Assessment of Reference  Documents in the 5G Ecosystem);  • identifies gaps in standardisation by comparing the existing literature against an ideal  situation of cybersecurity robustness and resilience, where standardisation addresses the  necessary technical and organisational security aspects; and (Section 4 Identification of Gaps  in Standardisation).  2 Section 2.2 explains the taxonomy used by the document. For convenience the report refers to the documents analysed  as, alternatively, ‘reference documents’, ‘references’, ‘existing literature’ or ‘standards, specifications, guidelines’.  3 https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/IP_20_2391  5G CYBERSECURITY STANDARDS  March 2022  9  • formulates recommendations on standardisation in the area of 5G cybersecurity (Section 5  Recommendations).  1.3 TARGET AUDIENCE AND PREREQUISITES  This work is intended for the stakeholders in the 5G ecosystem, in particular standardisation  working groups, industry stakeholders and national cybersecurity agencies across the European  Union.  The reader is invited to get familiar with the concepts of information security risk management  as documented in the ISO/IEC 27005 international standard, as well as the concepts developed  in the following documents:  • ENISA, Guideline on Security Measures under the EECC, 2020,  • ENISA, 5G Supplement to the Guideline on Security Measures under EECC, 2021,  • ENISA, Threat Landscape for 5G Networks, 2019,  • ENISA, Security in 5G Specifications, 2021,  • ENISA, EU Coordinated Risk Assessment of 5G Networks Security, 2019,  • ENISA, Methodology for Sectoral Cybersecurity Assessments, 2021.  An overview of the standardisation organisations active in 5G is contained in ENISA report  ‘Security in 5G specifications’4.  4 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/security-in-5g-specifications  5G CYBERSECURITY STANDARDS  March 2022  10  2. SCOPE, DEFINITIONS, AND  CONVENTIONS  This section provides the concepts and definitions used to build the ‘5G Ecosystem’ introduced  in Section 1.2 Overview and Structure of the Study. This ecosystem provides a methodological  framework in which it is possible to locate the standards, the specifications and the guidelines  relevant for a given stakeholder group, at a given step of the technology lifecycle, for a given  block of the 5G technical architecture.  2.1 THE 5G ECOSYSTEM  As introduced in section 1.2 Overview and Structure of the Study, the 5G ecosystem is  composed of the following dimensions.  Figure 1: The dimensions of the 5G ecosystem  Building blocks of the 5G Ecosystem Definitions  5G Technological and functional domains  Essential functions of 5G networks and the related supporting  asset categories, representing 5G technical components and  the scope of their interactions.  Technology lifecycle processes  Processes applied to the lifecycle of 5G services and of 5G- dependent vertical industrial processes.  5G Stakeholders  Entities (either public or private) that are related to 5G  networks and vertical industries.  5G Security domains, objectives and measures  Security dimension of the 5G ecosystem, represented through  the security domains, objectives and measures of the ENISA  Guideline on Security Measures under the EECC and its 5G  supplement.  2.1.1 5G technological and functional domains  The current section outlines the essential functions of 5G networks and the related categories of  supporting assets considered in this report.  The 5G technological and functional domains considered are largely based on the set of planes,  functional blocks and process blocks of the widely acknowledged representation of the generic  5G architecture depicted in the ENISA report ENISA Threat Landscape for 5G Networks  Updated 2020, which in turn relies on the architecture of the 3GPP Technical Specification  23.502 (Release 16). They have been selected because they offer a synthetic overview of 5G  technology and 5G-related processes. For the purpose of this study, only the major blocks  depicted in Figure 2 have been considered.  5G CYBERSECURITY STANDARDS  March 2022  11  Figure 2: The 5G technological and functional domains as represented in ENISA Threat  Landscape for 5G Networks Updated 2020  Figure 3: The 5G technological and functional domains considered by the current study  G Technical and functional domains Definition  5G Use Cases  End-to-end services based on 5G, characterised by how they  use and/or transmit data. Example: ‘Vehicle-to-everything’,  eMBB, mMTC, URLLC.  Multi Access Edge Computing (MEC) Services  Multi-access computing services used to bring computation  and connectivity closer to the end-user in order to meet the  requirements for data transmission speed and latency.  Physical infrastructure Set of premises including hardware and software for  computation, storage, transmission, as well as the related  technical environment (energy, air conditioning, cable paths,  civil works infrastructures, etc.).  Virtualised Infrastructure Computing, storage and networking capacities on demand.  Radio Access Network (RAN) Logical and hardware components making up the functions of  the radio access network. It includes mainly distribution units  and control units for radio access.  Multi Access Edge Computing (MEC) Infrastructure Infrastructure related to the decentralisation of cloud functions  (storage of data and computing) located closer to the user or  edge device.  5G Core Network, Network Function (CN NF) Central part of the 5G infrastructure which enables new  functions related to multi-access technologies. Its main  5G CYBERSECURITY STANDARDS  March 2022  12  purpose is to deliver services over all kinds of networks  (wireless, fixed, converged).  Data Network (DN) Connectivity to external data, content, services and other  resources available outside the 5G network. The data network  is also used to interconnect different 5G networks, operators  and providers.  Transport Part of the network ensuring the connectivity between the  access and core networks.  Management and Orchestration (MANO)  Software, operations tools and the related environment used to  automate operations that relate to the lifecycle of the  infrastructure and service components.  2.1.2 Technology lifecycle processes  Lifecycle processes can be regarded as the heartbeat of all activities based on digital  technologies. This section defines the scope of the technology lifecycle processes considered in  the 5G ecosystem. They are the processes related to the lifecycle of 5G services and of 5G- dependent vertical industries. To keep the analysis simple, the methodology selects some of the  processes listed in GSMA, GSMA FS.16 - NESAS Development and Lifecycle Security  Requirements v2.0, 2021.  Such processes are considered in a technology environment including (but not limited to):  • 5G technologies given their underlying technological bricks from cloud-native and service- based architectures,  • their orchestration and their automation,  • their components running on top of virtualised infrastructures requiring orchestration and  automation.  The considered processes encompass the phases shown in Figure 4 below.  Figure 4: The phases of the technology lifecycle processes considered in the 5G ecosystem  Phase Definition  Think All activities related to the design of a service, the design  principles of an infrastructure, as well as the study of their  technological and operational options. The main deliverables of  this phase are (for example) anticipation studies, benchmarks,  opportunity studies, high-level designs and initial risk  assessments.  Build All activities that prepare and execute the building phase of a  service, including the integration of the software parts,  connectivity, application interfaces, data flows and related  protocols. When security is integrated within the ‘Build’  process, the corresponding milestones consist in checking the  robustness of the architecture, its attack surface and updating  the risks accordingly.  Test All activities that verify the compliance with specifications,  robustness or resilience prior or after the ‘go-live’ phase, also  including auditing at any phase of the lifecycle.  Run All activities including the continuous delivery of services,  performance and fault management, problem management,  customer support, etc.  Update Activities that relate to the process also referred to as  ‘Transition’, consisting in identifying capacity needs,  requirements for software updates, patch installation, needs for  robustness, adjustments to software and equipment  5G CYBERSECURITY STANDARDS  March 2022  13  configurations, and the on-demand provisioning capabilities  when a customer purchases a service.  End of Life The sequence of steps towards decommissioning or the end of  the lifecycle of a service component.  In this context, it is to be noted that the lifecycle processes apply to a variety of areas and  stakeholders beyond 5G products alone. These lifecycle processes are applicable to systems  other than 5G products, such as IT systems used to operate, test, orchestrate, automate, and  develop service bricks.  The figure below is an example showing where security steps can be implemented in the  lifecycle processes to enable robustness and resilience from an end-to-end perspective.  Figure 5: Representation of the lifecycle processes considered in the 5G ecosystem  2.1.3 5G Stakeholders  The 5G ecosystem relies on several stakeholders that play different roles in its security at  different levels. The set of stakeholders selected for this document focuses on entities (either  public or private) that are related to 5G networks and vertical industries.  The set has been adapted from the EU Coordinated Risk Assessment on 5G Networks Security  and the ENISA Threat Landscape for 5G Networks Updated (2020), as they encompass both  the stakeholders and their role with regards to 5G. They are depicted in the following table.  Figure 5: The categories of the 5G stakeholders considered in the 5G ecosystem  Stakeholder category Definition  5G Service customer or consumer  Entities that use services that are offered by a service provider  (SP): in the context of 5G, these would be, for example, vertical  industries and their private networks. In addition, consumers of  5G services without a business-relation with a 5G service  provider (for example, end users) are included in this category.  This category may implement standards, specifications  and guidelines to achieve the security objectives for the  safe use, deployment and operation of 5G networks and/or  services.  5G CYBERSECURITY STANDARDS  March 2022  14  Telecommunications sector (Telecom)  This category encompasses entities that are responsible for  the manufacture, deployment and operation of 5G networks,  such as:  • Mobile Network Operators (MNOs): entities providing  mobile network services to users, operating their  own network, if necessary with the help of third  parties  • Suppliers of mobile networks: entities providing  services or infrastructure to MNOs in order to build  and/or operate their networks (both telecom  equipment manufacturers and other third-party  suppliers, such as cloud infrastructure providers and  network infrastructure providers and managed  services providers)  • Service providers (SP): entities that design, build and  operate services using aggregated network services.  Examples include communication service providers  offering traditional telecom services, digital service  providers offering digital services such as enhanced  mobile broadband and IoT to various vertical  industries, or network slice as a service (NSaaS)  providers offering a network slice along with the  services that it may support and configure.  • Virtualisation infrastructure service providers (VISP):  entities that provide virtualised infrastructure services  and design, build, and operate virtualisation  infrastructure(s). The infrastructure comprises  networking (e.g. for mobile transport) and computing  resources (e.g. from computing platforms).  This category may implement standards, specifications  and guidelines to achieve the security objectives for the  safe use, deployment and operation of 5G networks and/or  services.  Datacentre services providers (DCSP)  Entities that provide data centre services and that design, build  and operate their data centres. A DCSP differs from a VISP by  offering ‘raw’ resources (i.e. host servers) in rather centralised  locations and simple services for consumption of these raw  resources. A VISP rather offers access to a variety of  resources by aggregating multiple technology domains and  making them accessible through a single API.  This category may implement standards, specifications  and guidelines to achieve the security objectives for the  safe use, deployment and operation of 5G networks and/or  services.  Connected devices industry  This category includes manufacturers of connected devices  and related service providers, meaning entities providing  objects or services that will connect to 5G networks (e.g.  smartphones, connected vehicles, e-health) and related  service components hosted in a 5G control plane as defined in  a service-based architecture or mobile edge computing.  This category may implement standards, specifications  and guidelines to achieve the security objectives for the  safe use, deployment and operation of 5G networks and/or  services.  Cybersecurity assessment  This category includes entities that assess the security of 5G  networks and systems e.g. auditing companies and accredited  5G laboratories.  This category audits the implementation of standards,  specifications and guidelines.  Cybersecurity information exchange  This category includes entities that share threat intelligence  and incident-related information, for example information  sharing and analysis centres (ISACs) and cyber security  incident response teams (CSIRTs).  5G CYBERSECURITY STANDARDS  March 2022  15  This category may implement standards, specifications  and guidelines to securely exchange cyber-intelligence.  Standards development organisations (SDOs),  associations, alliances  This category encompasses entities that develop and  promote the adoption of standards, specifications and  guidelines, for example, GSMA and 3GPP.  Research and innovation organisations  This category encompasses entities contributing to R&D and  innovation tasks related to all kinds of innovative actions in  areas related to 5G, including verticals. It also includes open  source organisations or communities providing technological  support and guidance in the development of 5G functions and  services, as well as public-private partnerships and innovation  programmes.  This category exposes gaps in standardisation and  creates innovations that can lead to advancements in  standardisation by acting as starting points of new  standards, specifications and guidelines.  Explanatory notes:  • 5G vertical industries working at the ‘Think’ phase of the lifecycle have been included in the  category ‘Research and innovation organisations’.  • 5G vertical industries using 5G services have been considered as service customers, whereas  verticals delivering services to the customers in their own sector have been considered as  service providers.  • Open-source organisations have been included in the category ‘Research and innovation  organisations’ when considered for their development activities at the ‘Think’ phase of the  lifecycle. They have been included in the category ‘Suppliers of MNOs’ when considered for  their support to technologies in production.  2.1.4 5G Security domains, objectives and measures  This section outlines the security dimensions of the 5G ecosystem used in this report. In the  absence of an equally comprehensive framework, the report uses the security domains,  objectives and measures found in the ENISA Guideline on Security Measures under the EECC  and its 5G supplement. The former concern security in general, the latter concern 5G. Although  they target mainly operators, the domains and measures set out in the documents above have  been used as an analytical framework. Still, it is important to stress that the security measures  used are not to be considered as the totality of the measures necessary for the mitigation of  cybersecurity risks in 5G. Security objectives and measures could be added for any sectoral risk  assessment covering a subset of the 5G ecosystem. The table below shows the security  domains and objectives taken into consideration. The mapping of the reference documents is  further broken down into security measures in Annex 6 Detailed mapping.  Figure 6: Security domains and objectives in the Guideline on Security Measures under EECC  and its 5G Supplement  Security domains (D) Security objectives  D1 – Governance and risk management  • Information security policy  • Governance and risk management  • Security roles and responsibilities  • Security of third-party dependencies  D2 – Human resources security  • Background checks  • Security knowledge and training  • Personnel changes  5G CYBERSECURITY STANDARDS  March 2022  16  • Handling violations  D3 – Security of systems and facilities  • Physical and environmental security  • Security of supplies  • Access control to network and information systems  • Integrity of network and information systems  • Use of encryption  • Protection of security critical data  D4 – Operations management  • Operational procedures  • Change management  • Asset management  D5 – Incident management  • Incident management procedures  • Incident detection capability  • Incident reporting and communication  D6 – Business continuity management  • Service continuity strategy and contingency plans  • Disaster recovery capabilities  D7 – Monitoring, auditing, and testing  • Monitoring and logging policies  • Exercise contingency plans  • Network and information systems testing  • Security assessments  • Compliance monitoring  D8 – Threat awareness  • Threat intelligence  • Informing users about threats  2.2 TAXONOMY OF DOCUMENTS CONSIDERED  To facilitate the analysis, this report relies on a taxonomy comprising three categories of  documents. Each of the documents considered is assigned to one of the categories below,  according to its related definition:  • Standard: a technical specification, adopted by a recognised standardisation body, for  repeated or continuous application, with which compliance is not compulsory5. The standards  considered are documents produced by a standardisation body (international, national or  European), and whose content include (but is not limited to) requirements, principles,  description of frameworks or processes and codes of practice.  • ICT Technical specification: a technical specification in the field of information and  communication technologies6. ICT technical specifications are referred in this document as  ‘specifications’.  • Guidelines and Best Practices: documents that explain, interpret and simplify […] standards  or […] standardisation deliverables. These can include user guides, abstracts of standards,  best practice information and awareness-building actions, strategies, and training  programmes7.  For convenience, the report refers to the documents analysed as, alternatively, ‘reference  documents’, ‘references’, ‘existing literature’ or ‘standards, specifications and guidelines.  5 Standardisation bodies as defined by Regulation (EU) No 1025/2012, 2012), Article 2 paragraph (1)  6 Understood as ‘ICT technical specification’ as defined by Regulation (EU) No 1025/2012, 2012), Article 2 paragraph (5)  7 Definition adapted from Regulation (EU) No 1025/2012, 2012) Chapter IV, Article 15, paragraph 1 Alinea (f). The  reference to ‘European’ standards and standardisation deliverables has been deleted as the current report refers also to  non-European documents.  5G CYBERSECURITY STANDARDS  March 2022  17  Although these categories have been identified solely for the purpose of the study, they are  based on the EU Regulation on European standardisation (Regulation (EU) No 1025/2012,  2012) and of the International Standardisation Organisation (ISO). A reminder of the exact  definitions is given in Annexes 1 and 2 on the taxonomy for standards.  Cybersecurity standards provide an important range of contents: requirements applicable to  ICT-related domains of technology or processes, requirements for management systems,  frameworks and guidelines on security controls about ‘what’ to do.  In turn, reference documents helping the implementation and the ‘how’ to do things relate to  specifications, guidelines, and best practices.  The documents analysed in this report are listed in the Annex 5 Referencing the Existing  Literature. An important part of the 5G-related documents in this study are referred in the report  from ENISA  Security in 5G Specifications (2021).  5G CYBERSECURITY STANDARDS  March 2022  18  3. POSITIONING AND  ASSESSMENT OF  REFERENCE DOCUMENTS IN  THE 5G ECOSYSTEM  3.1 METHODOLOGY FOR THE ASSESSMENT OF COVERAGE  This section provides the methodology to position existing standards, specifications and  guidelines in the 5G ecosystem and to assess the extent to which they address the 5G security  environment. It consists of the following steps:  • Using ENISA’s literature and complementary knowledge of the Expert Group missioned for  this study, relevant documents are sampled and grouped into consistent clusters (‘shorthand’)  made up of a selection of standards, specifications, and guidelines. The documents analysed  are listed in the Section 6 Bibliography.  • These clusters are mapped against each security domain, objective and measure of the 5G  ecosystem as described Section 2.1.4 5G Security domains, objectives and measures.  • The relevance and the completeness of the clusters is then analysed from the perspectives of  the three remaining dimensions of the 5G ecosystem, that is its stakeholders (Section 2.1.3  5G Stakeholders); its technical and functional domains (Section 2.1.1 5G technological and  functional domains); and the related technology lifecycle processes (Section 2.1.2 Technology  lifecycle processes).  • The results of the mapping and of the assessment are described in the section Annex 6  Detailed Mapping. A summarised version is contained in section 3.2 Consolidated Results.  3.2 CONSOLIDATED RESULTS  The detailed analysis underlying this report concerns more than 150 security measures and  more than 140 documents which were identified and selected from the available literature. This  detailed and in-depth analysis is provided in section Annex 6 Detailed Mapping.  Given the volume of information and the level of detail, the current section only contains a  summary table, representing the consolidated findings by security domain. A high-level  assessment of the extent to which the analysed literature addresses a given security domain for  each of the dimensions of the 5G ecosystem (i.e. stakeholders, technological and functional  domains, and technology lifecycle processes) is also provided.  Some details may not be obvious in the consolidated results. For example, ‘All’ under the  column ‘Coverage of Stakeholders’ means that the literature analysed is considered relevant for  every entity in the ecosystem. The specific degree or depth of relevance for each category of  stakeholders, technological and functional domains, and technology lifecycle processes is  tackled in the detailed mapping.  5G CYBERSECURITY STANDARDS  March 2022  19  Figure 7: Summary of the coverage of existing literature by security domain  Security domain  Taxonomy of  applicable  documents  Coverage of the dimensions of the 5G ecosystem  Observations  Stakeholders  5G Technological  and functional  domains  Technology lifecycle  processes  D1 – Governance  and risk  management  Standards All All All  The documents referred to are, to some extent, relevant to all  dimensions of the 5G ecosystem.

IDENTIFICATION OF GAPS  IN STANDARDISATION  4.1 METHODOLOGY FOR THE IDENTIFICATION OF GAPS IN THE  EXISTING LITERATURE  This section presents existing literature addressing each security domain in accordance with  Section 2.1.4 5G Security domains, objectives and measures from the perspective of the  stakeholder considered in accordance with Section 2.1.3 5G Stakeholders and points to the  areas partly covered by existing literature as well as those covered to a limited extent or not at  all.  The identification of these areas relies on expert assessment by the authors of this report. They  have assessed the extent to which the existing literature addresses an ‘ideal situation’ where  5G technical and organisational cybersecurity risks are mitigated and adequate controls to  ensure security are performed thanks to available standards, specifications, and guidelines.  This is therefore the reference against which gaps in standardisation have been identified.  4.2 ASSESSMENT OF COVERAGE AND IDENTIFICATION OF GAPS IN  STANDARDISATION  The assessment of the coverage of the standards, specification and guidelines considered, as  well as the identification of the gaps in standardisation, is conveyed in the form of a table  (Figure 9), which follows the colour coding below:  Figure 8: Colour coding for the representation of the gaps  Colour  code Definition  Existing literature  The green cells show the existing literature addressing each security domain from the perspective  of the stakeholder considered.  Moderate Gap  The yellow cells indicate the areas where moderate gaps in standardisation have been identified.  A gap is identified as ‘moderate’ when the existing literature addresses the domain partly, meaning  that moderate effort would be required to bridge that gap.  Major gap  The orange cells indicate the areas where major gaps in standardisation have been identified.  A gap is identified as ‘major’ when the existing literature does not address the domain (or only to a  limited extent), meaning that a major effort would be required to bridge that gap.  No gap/Not relevant  The cells that are not coloured indicate areas where no gaps have been identified or only those  that are not relevant for the stakeholder.  For research and innovation organisations, gaps are intended as areas where further work by  these organisations is required.  5G CYBERSECURITY STANDARDS  March 2022  22  For every domain, the table (Figure 9) identifies between brackets the relevant literature as  grouped by the shorthand in Annex 5 Referencing the existing literature, reproduced below for  convenience.

the standards, specifications and guidelines presented in Section  6 Bibliography.  The following should be noted.  • The bibliography relies on a sampled set of documents. Despite the authors’ efforts, there  may exist standards, specifications or guidelines that are not referenced and thus a gap is  reported in error.  • When a partial or major gap is pointed out, the question arises as to whether this area should  be standardised, supported by specifications or guidelines, or whether company-specific  needs make this contextualisation impossible.  Given the above, the present report might over-represent existing gaps in some areas. For  example, in relation to the latter point, one consistent observation is that the lifecycle of open- source software does not fit well with the processes defined in the standards, specifications,  and guidelines. This is mainly due to the lack of a formal organisational structure that could  support, enforce and finance standardised processes in the open-source community. This is  particularly true for the security domains D1 (Governance and Risk Management), D7  (Monitoring, Auditing and Testing) and D8 (Threat Awareness).  Furthermore, the process for developing security standards is not included in the analysis itself.  The interests of individual players may influence the definition of security standards,  specifications, or guidelines in favour of economic or other trade-offs – sometimes at the cost of  a higher risk. One example is the trade-off between capabilities for legal interception and  security against espionage through end-to-end confidentiality.  4.5 ADDITIONAL LEARNINGS AND OBSERVATIONS  Complementary to the assessment of the coverage of the existing security literature, the  following elements intend to bring a qualitative perspective on the organisational and technical  5G CYBERSECURITY STANDARDS  March 2022  30  areas where the 5G stakeholders can intervene to improve maturity, robustness, and readiness  for resilience.  The following list gathers observations from the initial deployments of 4G that have been shared  in the Telecom industry. These trends continue to be relevant and should be considered in the  context of 5G8:  • The complexity of simultaneously operating virtualised infrastructure and virtualised  network functions (VNFs) working together;  • The need for consistency between the three key technical domains of VNFs (Virtual  Network Functions), SDN (Software-defined networks) controllers, IaaS (Infrastructure  as a Service) due to their mutual dependencies;  • The reliance on a Linux kernel leading to a systemic risk related to unexpected  changes of configuration or unexpected behaviours at the core of computing and  connectivity capabilities, possibly impacting also new critical functions e.g.  orchestration, containers and microservices;  • The emergence of new solutions to entrust data management on cloud-based and  serverless solutions, based on short-lived assets requiring new approaches for the  observability of actions and for detecting threats;  • New cloud environments impact identity and access management as they are no  longer purely role-based, but attribute-based and context-based;  • The increased need for confidentiality and resilience on connectivity and data storage  in the network and its operation;  • The exploding number of cryptographic certificates to ensure legitimacy and avoid  man-in-the-middle attacks shine a new light on key management;  • The abundance of configurations using text-based descriptors such as JSON and  XML, together with highly distributed processing and storage;  • The effects of the increased importance of IT technologies including the importance of  open source, both at service and infrastructure levels;  • The large number of APIs bringing complexity in ensuring the legitimacy of requests  and the balance between attack surface and the exposure of an application interface;  • Cybersecurity incidents involving the recurring exposure of credentials and secrets in  CI/CD environments;  • The MNOs’ tendency to outsource their network operations and field operations to  third-party service providers entrusted with multiple networks in multiple countries,  which reinforces the importance of connectivity and therefore the inter-dependency  between the ability to operate and the operated assets;  • Outsourcing to ‘tower companies’ (companies taking charge of the radio access sites)  and ‘fibre companies’ (companies that operate fibre access networks), which are now  entrusted with managing several operators simultaneously in several countries.  The above key trends are observed in 4G, but they should be taken into consideration to  improve the coverage of standardisation for the cybersecurity of 5G.  Furthermore, one should take into account the fact that 5G networks are ‘systems of systems’,  whose representation requires automation and abstraction and whose services necessitate end- to-end quality controls.  8 (Affirmed Networks, 2019)  5G CYBERSECURITY STANDARDS  March 2022  31  5. RECOMMENDATIONS  This section provides the recommendations that result from the previous sections and in  particular from the identification of gaps.  5.1 ADOPT A PROGRESSIVE APPROACH TO 5G STANDARDISATION  The report suggests that a progressive approach to 5G standardisation be undertaken. Such an  approach should start by improving existing literature. The current report could help this effort as  it gives an overview of references and assesses their suitability for a given security measure,  technical and functional domain and/or stakeholder. The creation of new references – if needed  – could be a subsequent step to enhance standardisation coverage.  5.2 HAVE A BROADER VIEW ON THE CREATION OF NEW REFERENCES  The creation of new standards, specifications and guidelines should consider several elements.  • Usefulness and necessity. It should be considered whether the creation of standards,  specifications and guidelines is necessary and/or useful for a specific security measure, for a  specific 5G domain, and/or for a specific stakeholder at a given stage of the lifecycle.  • Link with strategic objectives. It is recommended that a consistent link between any new  reference and the strategic objective it should serve is ensured. For instance, if the objective  of a new reference is to harmonise practices at the European level, local regulations should  be taken into consideration. For example, contextualisation of HR (human resources)  measures must account for local regulations. A special attention shall be brought to provisions  for legal interception.  • Measurability of effectiveness. New references should facilitate the consistent measuring of  the effectiveness of the security measures from an end-to-end service perspective.  • Consideration for new technologies. For example, detection tactics of incidents in 5G should  be tackled also from the perspective of the development and operation of Artificial Intelligence,  and not only from the standpoints of mobile network operators, their managed services  provider, and B2B verticals.  • Thinking beyond standardisation. In some cases, the effectiveness of standards,  specifications or guidelines depends on external factors. For example, because of the open  nature of the development of free and open source software (FOSS), security guidelines and  recommendations should be accompanied by the commitment of resources to development  and audit. Therefore, industry players and public administrations relying on open source  software should be encouraged to actively contribute to continuously improve and maintain  the security of the FOSS-based solutions.  5.3 FOSTER THE MATURITY AND THE COMPLETENESS OF THE  IDENTIFICATION AND ASSESSMENT OF RISK  Section 4 Identification of Gaps in Standardisation points to areas, for each security domain,  that are partly covered by the existing literature, as well as those covered to a limited extent or  not at all. Besides these specific areas, the experts observed a broader gap related to risk  assessment. The existing literature related to risk assessment is not specific to 5G and/or does  not identify and evaluate risks consistently. This leads to a fragmented security landscape which  might be detrimental for the overall security of 5G.  5G CYBERSECURITY STANDARDS  March 2022  32  Therefore, it is important to foster the maturity and the completeness of risk identification and  assessment, by harmonising risk assessment practices in a way that is inclusive of all  stakeholders of the 5G ecosystem. For example, this would imply in particular (but not only)  standardised:  • registers of risks, including from the perspective of the telecommunications sector and service  customers,  • skills and capacities frameworks for third party assessment,  • knowledge bases of threat scenarios,  • requirements for security monitoring,  • assessment methods with an adequate abstraction level,  • requirements for auditing capability, in particular for service providers.  In this context, it is worth mentioning the approach to risk identification outlined in ENISA’s  Methodology for Sectoral Cybersecurity Assessment, and described in the subsequent section.  5.3.1 ENISA’s methodology for sectoral cybersecurity assessment  The European Cybersecurity Act (CSA) obliges to the definition of security and certification  requirements for ICT products, services and processes to be based on the risk associated with  their intended use.  To this end, ENISA has proposed the SCSA methodology (ENISA Methodology for Sectoral  Cybersecurity Assessments, 2021) to support the identification of cybersecurity risks associated  with the intended use of systems in the context of business services and processes, with the  option to involve all stakeholders from sectoral vertical users to the providers of network  infrastructure. SCSA carries out the assessment at sectoral business level involving all relevant  5G stakeholders, their business objectives and their ICT subsystems and processes.  Cybersecurity risks are identified in relation to the business objectives and the risks identified  indicate the security, certification and assurance level requirements for particular ICT products,  services and processes. This can support a balance between the cost that a 5G stakeholder  has to cover for security and assurance and the benefit of protecting his business objectives.  5.4 FINAL OBSERVATIONS  It is to be noted that the prioritisation of new references to be created is outside the scope of  this work and that, in accordance with the previous recommendation, the creation of new  references might not always be necessary and should be part of a progressive approach which  should consider several aspects.  Finally, it is important to stress that, while the technical and organisational standards analysed  can contribute to the security of 5G, they should not be treated as an exhaustive list of  measures guaranteeing security. Besides considerations of the effectiveness of specific  standards that are outside the scope this report, it should be reminded that there are risks that  are not covered by standards, for example residual risks whose cost is neither borne by nor  attributable to a specific stakeholder, such as societal risks resulting from network malfunctions.  The complexity of 5G, as depicted in the previous sections, calls for a comprehensive vision of  trust and of resilience that goes beyond standardisation. This vision should be future-proof and  not dependent on the variability of assets and configurations in the network.  5G CYBERSECURITY STANDARDS  March 2022  33  6.

Bautista Jr (2019): Cyber kill chain and the OODA loop; O’Reilly Editions  5G CYBERSECURITY STANDARDS  March 2022  37  ANNEX – TAXONOMY FOR  STANDARDS  This section acts as a reminder of the definitions of document typologies from the EU regulatory  framework and the ISO.  A.1 DOCUMENT TYPOLOGIES DEFINED BY THE EU REGULATION  The European Union’s Regulation (EU) No 1025/2012, 2012 stipulates the following provisions:  A Technical specification is a document that prescribes technical requirements to be fulfilled  by a product, process, service or system (..).  Depending on the source of such specification, it could be a standard (standard means a  technical specification adopted by a recognised standardisation body for repeated or continuous  application) at the international, regional (e.g. European) or national level.  Additionally, there is the European standardisation deliverable, which refers to any technical  specification other than a European standard adopted by a European standardisation  organisation for repeated or continuous application.  Technical specifications, not being standards nor European standardisation deliverables, could  be identified as equivalent to standards if they meet the requirements set up in Annex II of  Regulation 1025/2012.  If the taxonomy based on EU Regulation 1025/2012 were considered it could look like:  A. Technical specification – document containing the requirements for:  A1 – Technical specification – standard  A2 – Technical specification – European standardisation deliverable considered as a standard  (adopted by one of the European Standards Organisations)  A3 – Technical Specification – standard (according to the rules and principles set up in Annex II  of the Regulation)  B. Document that contains information other than requirements:  B1 – (Name of a Recognised Standardisation Body) standard – Framework  B2 – (Name of a Recognised Standardisation Body) standard – Guidelines  B3 – (Name of a Recognised Standardisation Body) standard – Best practices  B4 – (Name of a Recognised Standardisation Body) standard – Vocabulary  A.2 DOCUMENT TYPOLOGIES DEFINED BY ISO  If we consider the ISO taxonomy we are dealing with the following (according to ISO):  Standard: is a document established by consensus and approved by a recognised body that  provides for common and repeated use rules, guidelines or characteristics for activities or their  results, aimed at the achievement of the optimum degree of order in a given context.  International Standard: is a standard that is adopted by an international standardising or  standards organisation and made available to the public.  5G CYBERSECURITY STANDARDS  March 2022  38  Technical Specification (TS): is a document published by ISO or IEC for which there is, in the  future, the possibility of agreement on an International Standard but for which at present:  • the required support for approval as an International Standard cannot be obtained,  • there is doubt on whether consensus has been achieved,  • the subject matter is still under technical development, or  • there is another reason precluding immediate publication as an International Standard.  Technical Report (TR): is a document published by ISO or IEC containing collected data of a  different kind from that normally published by ISO or IEC.  If the ISO taxonomy were considered it could look like:  A. Standards  A1 – (Name of a Recognised Standardisation Body) Standard – Requirements  A2 – (Name of a Recognised Standardisation Body) Standard – Framework  A3 – (Name of a Recognised Standardisation Body) Standard – Guidelines  A4 – (Name of a Recognised Standardisation Body) Standard – Vocabulary  B. Technical reports  B1 – ISO Technical Report – Guidelines  B2 – ISO Technical Report – Best practices  C. Non-standard documents  C1  – (Name of the Issuer) – Guidelines  C2  – (Name of the Issuer) – Best Practices  5G CYBERSECURITY STANDARDS  March 2022  39  ANNEX – MAPPING  In the detailed analysis, to keep the information in the table manageable, the convention used in  this annex is proposed to refer to one or several stakeholders, one or several documents, under  a common label.  A.3 REFERENCING THE 5G TECHNICAL AND FUNCTIONAL DOMAINS  In the detailed analysis, to keep the information in the table manageable, a convention specific  to this document is proposed to refer to one or several 5G technical and functional domains  under a common label. The table below provides for every 5G domain, the associated label.  5G Technical and functional domains Definition  5G Use cases  End-to-end services based on 5G, characterised by how they  use and/or transmit data. Example: ‘Vehicle-to-everything’,  eMBB, mMTC, URLLC.  Multi Access Edge Computing (MEC) Services  Multi access computing services used to bring computation  and connectivity closer to the end-user in order to meet the  requirements for data transmission speed and latency.  Physical Infrastructure Set of premises including hardware and software for  computation, storage and transmission as well as the related  technical environment (energy, air conditioning, cable paths,  civil works infrastructures, etc.).  Virtualised Infrastructure Computing, storage and networking capacities on demand.  Radio Access Network (RAN) Logical and hardware components making up the functions of  the radio access network. It includes mainly distribution units  and control units for radio access.  Multi Access Edge Computing (MEC) Infrastructure Infrastructure related to the decentralisation of cloud functions  (storage of data and computing) located closer to the user or  edge device.  5G Core Network, Network Function (CN NF) Central part of the 5G infrastructure which enables new  functions related to multi-access technologies. Its main  purpose is to deliver services over all kinds of networks  (wireless, fixed, converged).  Data Network (DN) Connectivity to external data, content, services and other  resources available outside the 5G network. The data network  is also used to interconnect different 5G networks, operators  and providers.  Transport Part of the network ensuring the connectivity between the  access and core networks.  Management and Orchestration (MANO)  Software, operations tools and the related environment used to  automate operations that relate to the lifecycle of the  infrastructure and service components.  A.4 REFERENCING THE STAKEHOLDERS  In the detailed analysis, to keep the information in the table manageable, a convention specific  to this document is proposed to refer to one or several stakeholders under a common label. The  table below provides for every stakeholder category, the list of the concerned stakeholders is  represented by the designation provided in Section 2.1.3 5G Stakeholders.  5G CYBERSECURITY STANDARDS  March 2022  40  Stakeholder category Definition  5G Service customer or consumer  Entities that use services that are offered by a service provider  (SP). In the context of 5G, these would be, for example,  vertical industries and their private networks. In addition,  consumers of 5G services without a business relation with a  5G service provider (e.g. end users) are included in this  category.  This category may implement standards, specifications  and guidelines to achieve the security objectives for the  safe use, deployment and operation of 5G networks and/or  services.  Telecommunications sector (Telecom)  This category encompasses entities that are responsible for  the manufacture, deployment and operation of 5G networks,  such as:  • Mobile network operators: entities providing mobile  network services to users, operating their own  network, if necessary with the help of third parties.  • Suppliers of mobile networks: entities providing  services or infrastructure to MNOs in order to build  and/or operate their networks (both telecom  equipment manufacturers and other third-party  suppliers, such as cloud infrastructure providers and  network infrastructure providers and managed  services providers).  • Service provider (SP): entities that design, build and  operate services using aggregated network services  such as, for example, communication service  providers offering traditional telecom services, digital  service providers offering digital services such as  enhanced mobile broadband and IoT to various  vertical industries, or network slice as a service  (NSaaS) providers offering a network slice along with  the services that it may support and configure.  • Virtualisation infrastructure service providers (VISP):  entities that provide virtualised infrastructure services  and that design, build and operate virtualisation  infrastructure(s). The infrastructure comprises  networking (e.g. for mobile transport) and computing  resources (e.g. from computing platforms).  This category may implement standards, specifications  and guidelines to achieve the security objectives for the  safe use, deployment and operation of 5G networks and/or  services.  Datacentre services providers (DCSP)  Entities that provide data centre services and that design, build  and operate their data centres. A DCSP differs from a VISP by  offering ’raw’ resources (i.e. host servers) in rather centralised  locations and simple services for consumption of these raw  resources. A VISP rather offers access to a variety of  resources by aggregating multiple technology domains and  making them accessible through a single API.  This category may implement standards, specifications  and guidelines to achieve the security objectives for the  safe use, deployment and operation of 5G networks and/or  services.  Connected devices industry  This category includes manufacturers of connected devices  and related service providers, meaning entities providing  objects or services that will connect to 5G networks (e.g.  smartphones, connected vehicles, e-health) and related  service components hosted in a 5G control plane as defined in  service-based architecture or mobile edge computing.  This category may implement standards, specifications  and guidelines to achieve the security objectives for the  safe use, deployment and operation of 5G networks and/or  services.  5G CYBERSECURITY STANDARDS  March 2022  41  Cybersecurity assessment  This category includes entities that assess the security of 5G  networks and systems e.g. auditing companies and accredited  5G laboratories.  This category audits the implementation of standards,  specifications and guidelines.  Cybersecurity information exchange  This category includes entities that share threat intelligence  and incident-related information, for example information  sharing and analysis centres (ISACs) and cyber security  incident response team (CSIRTs).  This category may implement standards, specifications  and guidelines to securely exchange cyber-intelligence.  Standards development organisations (SDOs),  associations, alliances  This category encompasses entities that develop and  promote the adoption of standards, specifications and  guidelines, for example GSMA and 3GPP.  Research and innovation organisations  This category encompasses entities contributing to R&D and  innovation tasks related to all kinds of innovative actions in the  areas related to 5G, including verticals. It also includes open  source organisations or communities providing technological  support and guidance in the development of 5G functions and  services, as well as public-private partnerships and innovation  programmes.  This category exposes gaps in standardisation and  creates innovations that can lead to advancements in  standardisation, by acting as starting points for new  standards, specifications and guidelines.  5G CYBERSECURITY STANDARDS  March 2022  42  A.5 REFERENCING THE EXISTING LITERATURE  In the detailed analysis, to keep the information in the detailed analysis table manageable, a  convention specific to this document is proposed for referring to one or several documents  under a common cluster for easy reference.  The clustering choice is based on either the family of documents or common security theme.

The detailed  mapping  distinguishes  general security  measures and  5G-specific  ones.  The taxonomy of  the reference  documents.  This column is  intended to keep  the reader  aware of what  the literature  group is about.  A standard and  a specification  tend to express  ‘What to do’ or  ‘Security  features’,  whereas a  guideline tends  to provide  elements on the  ’How to  implement  security’, closer  to  considerations  of the build and  the run.  This is described  in Section 2.2  Taxonomy of  Documents  Considered  A group name to  designate  several literature  references  identified as  matching (but  not necessary  fulfilling) the  purpose of the  security  measure. The  group names  are described in  Annex 6.A.5  referencing the  existing  literature  A group name  designating  stakeholders of  the 5G  ecosystem  covered by the  literature  identified. The  group names  are described in  Annex 6.A.4  referencing the  stakeholders  A group name  referring to the  5G domains  covered by the  literature  identified. The  5G domains are  grouped  according to  Annex 6.A.3  referencing the  5G technical  and functional  domains  Lifecycle  processes  covered by the  literature  identified. The  lifecycle  processes are  provided in  Section 2.1.2  Technology  lifecycle  processes.  The conventions for the comments used in the detailed analysis are as follows.  ‘All’: the reference document is considered applicable to every entity in the ecosystem, at  various degrees and at different depths. The specific degree or depth of applicability to each  entity are not assessed here.  ‘Not put into context and not immediately actionable’ means that the reference document is  generic and may be applied to the entity. Further work is required to tailor it to the specific  context.  The coverage of the references has been assessed by considering how they can be used to  serve given security measures. When the reference only mentions the security measure without  providing a specific relevant tool for its implementation, the reference is not mentioned.  5G CYBERSECURITY STANDARDS  March 2022  51  D1 - GOVERNANCE AND RISK MANAGEMENT  SO 1 - Information security policy  Security measure  Applicable  documents  taxonomy  Reference to  the  documents  Coverage of  stakeholders  Coverage of 5G  technological and  functional domains  Coverage of  lifecycle processes  Set a high-level security  policy addressing the  security of networks and  services.

The 5G ecosystem  considered in this report is a multi-dimensional space encompassing not only technological and  functional domains, but also the related technology lifecycle processes and stakeholders.  This report focuses on standardisation from a technical and organisational perspective.  Considerations of the effectiveness of specific standards and of the strategic aspects related to  5G security, although important, are outside the scope of this report.  Accordingly, this report:  • Collects standards, specifications and guidelines1 relevant to the cybersecurity of the 5G  ecosystem that had been published, either as drafts or in their final versions, by September  2021;  • Positions them within the defined 5G ecosystem by assessing the extent to which they  address security objectives;  • Identifies gaps in standardisation by comparing the existing literature against an ideal  situation of cybersecurity robustness and resilience, where standardisation addresses the  necessary technical and organisational security aspects;  • Formulates recommendations on standardisation in the area of 5G cybersecurity.  The report collects and analyses more than 140 documents and positions them across 150  security measures. The main observations that can be derived from the analysis are the  following.  • All in all, available standards, specifications and guidelines are general. They can be applied  consistently to the 5G technical and functional domains and related lifecycle processes only  after being tailored accordingly.  • 5G-specific standards, specifications and guidelines are available to a greater extent to the  stakeholders of the telecommunication sector than for other stakeholders (e.g. audit  organisations and stakeholders in the connected devices industry).  • 5G-specific standards, specifications and guidelines cover to a greater extent the ‘run’ phase  of a technology lifecycle, whereas other phases would need tailoring.  • Existing knowledge bases on cybersecurity threats and IT-security guidelines can be used for  5G cloud native architectures and architectures relying on APIs (Application Programming  Interface). Although these families of software are well known to the IT industry, their use is  quite recent and constitute drivers of the ‘cloudification’ of the telecom sector.  • The existing literature does not allow for ‘end-to-end’ trust and resilience in the 5G ecosystem.  For example, guidelines for 5G-specific tools and key performance indicators could be needed  to ensure a common understanding of 5G protection and of end-to-end trust and resilience.  Concerning gaps in standardisation, the report finds that only the areas of governance and risk  management as well as the security of human resources present moderate gaps e.g. related to  sector-specific risk management. The other areas considered (e.g. operations management,  1 Section 2.2 explains the taxonomy used by the document. For convenience the report refers to all considered documents  alternatively as ’standards, specifications, guidelines’, ‘existing literature’, ‘reference documents’.  5G CYBERSECURITY STANDARDS  March 2022  7  business continuity management and incident management) present major gaps in  standardisation.  Still, this report recommends the adoption of a progressive approach to 5G standardisation,  which should consider several elements such as the usefulness and necessity of new standards  and their link with strategic objectives. It also notes the importance of fostering the maturity and  the completeness of the identification and assessment of risk by harmonising risk assessment  practices in a way that is inclusive of all stakeholders in the 5G ecosystem.  Finally, this report stresses that, while the technical and organisational standards analysed can  contribute to the security of 5G, they should not be treated as an exhaustive list of measures  guaranteeing security. There are risks that are not covered by standards, for example residual  risks whose cost is neither borne by nor attributable to a specific stakeholder, such as societal  risks resulting from network malfunctions. Indeed, the complexity of 5G calls for a  comprehensive vision of trust and of resilience that goes beyond standardisation. This vision  should be future-proof and not dependent on the variability of assets and configurations in the  network.  5G CYBERSECURITY STANDARDS  March 2022  8  1. INTRODUCTION  1.1 DOCUMENT PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVES  The ambition of this document is to outline the contribution of standardisation to the mitigation of  technical risks, and therefore to trust and resilience, in the 5G ecosystem. Accordingly, the  objectives of the document are:  • to provide an overview of standards, specifications and guidelines2 relevant to the  cybersecurity of the 5G ecosystem and that had been published, either as drafts or in their  final versions, by September 2021;  • to facilitate the positioning and to assess the applicability of any reference document in the 5G  security environment;  • to formulate recommendations on standardisation in the area of 5G security.  The document focuses on standardisation from a technical and organisational perspective.  Considerations of the effectiveness of specific standards and of the strategic and policy aspects  related to 5G security, although important, are outside the scope of this report.  Note on the relation to other on-going work on 5G cybersecurity carried out by ENISA: this  report is not intended to pre-conceive any work related to the drafting of the European  cybersecurity certification candidate scheme on 5G networks.  1.2 OVERVIEW AND STRUCTURE OF THE STUDY  Businesses and institutions participate in several activities concerning 5G networks and 5G- dependent processes: their design, construction, operation, introduction to the market, use,  audit and even certification. Altogether, with various degrees of importance, they contribute to  the Digital Single Market.  The EU Cybersecurity Strategy3, published in 2020, reinstates the importance of trust and  resilience in the Union, to be sustained in the long run for societal purposes and at a systemic  scale. Therefore, cybersecurity risks and the capabilities for their mitigation need to be  considered also from a systemic perspective. To this end, the analysis proposed in the report is  based on a ‘5G Ecosystem’ defined as a multi-dimensional space comprising not only 5G  technological and functional domains but also the related technology lifecycle processes and  stakeholders. The conceived ecosystem is also underpinned by a security dimension. The  ecosystem and its components are described in detail in Section 2 Scope, Definitions and  Conventions.  After having defined the ‘5G Ecosystem’, the document:  • collects existing cybersecurity standards, specifications and guidelines, and positions them  within the defined 5G ecosystem (Section 3 Positioning and Assessment of Reference  Documents in the 5G Ecosystem);  • identifies gaps in standardisation by comparing the existing literature against an ideal  situation of cybersecurity robustness and resilience, where standardisation addresses the  necessary technical and organisational security aspects; and (Section 4 Identification of Gaps  in Standardisation).  2 Section 2.2 explains the taxonomy used by the document. For convenience the report refers to the documents analysed  as, alternatively, ‘reference documents’, ‘references’, ‘existing literature’ or ‘standards, specifications, guidelines’.  3 https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/IP_20_2391  5G CYBERSECURITY STANDARDS  March 2022  9  • formulates recommendations on standardisation in the area of 5G cybersecurity (Section 5  Recommendations).  1.3 TARGET AUDIENCE AND PREREQUISITES  This work is intended for the stakeholders in the 5G ecosystem, in particular standardisation  working groups, industry stakeholders and national cybersecurity agencies across the European  Union.  The reader is invited to get familiar with the concepts of information security risk management  as documented in the ISO/IEC 27005 international standard, as well as the concepts developed  in the following documents:  • ENISA, Guideline on Security Measures under the EECC, 2020,  • ENISA, 5G Supplement to the Guideline on Security Measures under EECC, 2021,  • ENISA, Threat Landscape for 5G Networks, 2019,  • ENISA, Security in 5G Specifications, 2021,  • ENISA, EU Coordinated Risk Assessment of 5G Networks Security, 2019,  • ENISA, Methodology for Sectoral Cybersecurity Assessments, 2021.  An overview of the standardisation organisations active in 5G is contained in ENISA report  ‘Security in 5G specifications’4.  4 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/security-in-5g-specifications  5G CYBERSECURITY STANDARDS  March 2022  10  2. SCOPE, DEFINITIONS, AND  CONVENTIONS  This section provides the concepts and definitions used to build the ‘5G Ecosystem’ introduced  in Section 1.2 Overview and Structure of the Study. This ecosystem provides a methodological  framework in which it is possible to locate the standards, the specifications and the guidelines  relevant for a given stakeholder group, at a given step of the technology lifecycle, for a given  block of the 5G technical architecture.  2.1 THE 5G ECOSYSTEM  As introduced in section 1.2 Overview and Structure of the Study, the 5G ecosystem is  composed of the following dimensions.  Figure 1: The dimensions of the 5G ecosystem  Building blocks of the 5G Ecosystem Definitions  5G Technological and functional domains  Essential functions of 5G networks and the related supporting  asset categories, representing 5G technical components and  the scope of their interactions.  Technology lifecycle processes  Processes applied to the lifecycle of 5G services and of 5G- dependent vertical industrial processes.  5G Stakeholders  Entities (either public or private) that are related to 5G  networks and vertical industries.  5G Security domains, objectives and measures  Security dimension of the 5G ecosystem, represented through  the security domains, objectives and measures of the ENISA  Guideline on Security Measures under the EECC and its 5G  supplement.  2.1.1 5G technological and functional domains  The current section outlines the essential functions of 5G networks and the related categories of  supporting assets considered in this report.  The 5G technological and functional domains considered are largely based on the set of planes,  functional blocks and process blocks of the widely acknowledged representation of the generic  5G architecture depicted in the ENISA report ENISA Threat Landscape for 5G Networks  Updated 2020, which in turn relies on the architecture of the 3GPP Technical Specification  23.502 (Release 16). They have been selected because they offer a synthetic overview of 5G  technology and 5G-related processes. For the purpose of this study, only the major blocks  depicted in Figure 2 have been considered.  5G CYBERSECURITY STANDARDS  March 2022  11  Figure 2: The 5G technological and functional domains as represented in ENISA Threat  Landscape for 5G Networks Updated 2020  Figure 3: The 5G technological and functional domains considered by the current study  G Technical and functional domains Definition  5G Use Cases  End-to-end services based on 5G, characterised by how they  use and/or transmit data. Example: ‘Vehicle-to-everything’,  eMBB, mMTC, URLLC.  Multi Access Edge Computing (MEC) Services  Multi-access computing services used to bring computation  and connectivity closer to the end-user in order to meet the  requirements for data transmission speed and latency.  Physical infrastructure Set of premises including hardware and software for  computation, storage, transmission, as well as the related  technical environment (energy, air conditioning, cable paths,  civil works infrastructures, etc.).  Virtualised Infrastructure Computing, storage and networking capacities on demand.  Radio Access Network (RAN) Logical and hardware components making up the functions of  the radio access network. It includes mainly distribution units  and control units for radio access.  Multi Access Edge Computing (MEC) Infrastructure Infrastructure related to the decentralisation of cloud functions  (storage of data and computing) located closer to the user or  edge device.  5G Core Network, Network Function (CN NF) Central part of the 5G infrastructure which enables new  functions related to multi-access technologies. Its main  5G CYBERSECURITY STANDARDS  March 2022  12  purpose is to deliver services over all kinds of networks  (wireless, fixed, converged).  Data Network (DN) Connectivity to external data, content, services and other  resources available outside the 5G network. The data network  is also used to interconnect different 5G networks, operators  and providers.  Transport Part of the network ensuring the connectivity between the  access and core networks.  Management and Orchestration (MANO)  Software, operations tools and the related environment used to  automate operations that relate to the lifecycle of the  infrastructure and service components.  2.1.2 Technology lifecycle processes  Lifecycle processes can be regarded as the heartbeat of all activities based on digital  technologies. This section defines the scope of the technology lifecycle processes considered in  the 5G ecosystem. They are the processes related to the lifecycle of 5G services and of 5G- dependent vertical industries. To keep the analysis simple, the methodology selects some of the  processes listed in GSMA, GSMA FS.16 - NESAS Development and Lifecycle Security  Requirements v2.0, 2021.  Such processes are considered in a technology environment including (but not limited to):  • 5G technologies given their underlying technological bricks from cloud-native and service- based architectures,  • their orchestration and their automation,  • their components running on top of virtualised infrastructures requiring orchestration and  automation.  The considered processes encompass the phases shown in Figure 4 below.  Figure 4: The phases of the technology lifecycle processes considered in the 5G ecosystem  Phase Definition  Think All activities related to the design of a service, the design  principles of an infrastructure, as well as the study of their  technological and operational options. The main deliverables of  this phase are (for example) anticipation studies, benchmarks,  opportunity studies, high-level designs and initial risk  assessments.  Build All activities that prepare and execute the building phase of a  service, including the integration of the software parts,  connectivity, application interfaces, data flows and related  protocols. When security is integrated within the ‘Build’  process, the corresponding milestones consist in checking the  robustness of the architecture, its attack surface and updating  the risks accordingly.  Test All activities that verify the compliance with specifications,  robustness or resilience prior or after the ‘go-live’ phase, also  including auditing at any phase of the lifecycle.  Run All activities including the continuous delivery of services,  performance and fault management, problem management,  customer support, etc.  Update Activities that relate to the process also referred to as  ‘Transition’, consisting in identifying capacity needs,  requirements for software updates, patch installation, needs for  robustness, adjustments to software and equipment  5G CYBERSECURITY STANDARDS  March 2022  13  configurations, and the on-demand provisioning capabilities  when a customer purchases a service.  End of Life The sequence of steps towards decommissioning or the end of  the lifecycle of a service component.  In this context, it is to be noted that the lifecycle processes apply to a variety of areas and  stakeholders beyond 5G products alone. These lifecycle processes are applicable to systems  other than 5G products, such as IT systems used to operate, test, orchestrate, automate, and  develop service bricks.  The figure below is an example showing where security steps can be implemented in the  lifecycle processes to enable robustness and resilience from an end-to-end perspective.  Figure 5: Representation of the lifecycle processes considered in the 5G ecosystem  2.1.3 5G Stakeholders  The 5G ecosystem relies on several stakeholders that play different roles in its security at  different levels. The set of stakeholders selected for this document focuses on entities (either  public or private) that are related to 5G networks and vertical industries.  The set has been adapted from the EU Coordinated Risk Assessment on 5G Networks Security  and the ENISA Threat Landscape for 5G Networks Updated (2020), as they encompass both  the stakeholders and their role with regards to 5G. They are depicted in the following table.  Figure 5: The categories of the 5G stakeholders considered in the 5G ecosystem  Stakeholder category Definition  5G Service customer or consumer  Entities that use services that are offered by a service provider  (SP): in the context of 5G, these would be, for example, vertical  industries and their private networks. In addition, consumers of  5G services without a business-relation with a 5G service  provider (for example, end users) are included in this category.  This category may implement standards, specifications  and guidelines to achieve the security objectives for the  safe use, deployment and operation of 5G networks and/or  services.  5G CYBERSECURITY STANDARDS  March 2022  14  Telecommunications sector (Telecom)  This category encompasses entities that are responsible for  the manufacture, deployment and operation of 5G networks,  such as:  • Mobile Network Operators (MNOs): entities providing  mobile network services to users, operating their  own network, if necessary with the help of third  parties  • Suppliers of mobile networks: entities providing  services or infrastructure to MNOs in order to build  and/or operate their networks (both telecom  equipment manufacturers and other third-party  suppliers, such as cloud infrastructure providers and  network infrastructure providers and managed  services providers)  • Service providers (SP): entities that design, build and  operate services using aggregated network services.  Examples include communication service providers  offering traditional telecom services, digital service  providers offering digital services such as enhanced  mobile broadband and IoT to various vertical  industries, or network slice as a service (NSaaS)  providers offering a network slice along with the  services that it may support and configure.  • Virtualisation infrastructure service providers (VISP):  entities that provide virtualised infrastructure services  and design, build, and operate virtualisation  infrastructure(s). The infrastructure comprises  networking (e.g. for mobile transport) and computing  resources (e.g. from computing platforms).  This category may implement standards, specifications  and guidelines to achieve the security objectives for the  safe use, deployment and operation of 5G networks and/or  services.  Datacentre services providers (DCSP)  Entities that provide data centre services and that design, build  and operate their data centres. A DCSP differs from a VISP by  offering ‘raw’ resources (i.e. host servers) in rather centralised  locations and simple services for consumption of these raw  resources. A VISP rather offers access to a variety of  resources by aggregating multiple technology domains and  making them accessible through a single API.  This category may implement standards, specifications  and guidelines to achieve the security objectives for the  safe use, deployment and operation of 5G networks and/or  services.  Connected devices industry  This category includes manufacturers of connected devices  and related service providers, meaning entities providing  objects or services that will connect to 5G networks (e.g.  smartphones, connected vehicles, e-health) and related  service components hosted in a 5G control plane as defined in  a service-based architecture or mobile edge computing.  This category may implement standards, specifications  and guidelines to achieve the security objectives for the  safe use, deployment and operation of 5G networks and/or  services.  Cybersecurity assessment  This category includes entities that assess the security of 5G  networks and systems e.g. auditing companies and accredited  5G laboratories.  This category audits the implementation of standards,  specifications and guidelines.  Cybersecurity information exchange  This category includes entities that share threat intelligence  and incident-related information, for example information  sharing and analysis centres (ISACs) and cyber security  incident response teams (CSIRTs).  5G CYBERSECURITY STANDARDS  March 2022  15  This category may implement standards, specifications  and guidelines to securely exchange cyber-intelligence.  Standards development organisations (SDOs),  associations, alliances  This category encompasses entities that develop and  promote the adoption of standards, specifications and  guidelines, for example, GSMA and 3GPP.  Research and innovation organisations  This category encompasses entities contributing to R&D and  innovation tasks related to all kinds of innovative actions in  areas related to 5G, including verticals. It also includes open  source organisations or communities providing technological  support and guidance in the development of 5G functions and  services, as well as public-private partnerships and innovation  programmes.  This category exposes gaps in standardisation and  creates innovations that can lead to advancements in  standardisation by acting as starting points of new  standards, specifications and guidelines.  Explanatory notes:  • 5G vertical industries working at the ‘Think’ phase of the lifecycle have been included in the  category ‘Research and innovation organisations’.  • 5G vertical industries using 5G services have been considered as service customers, whereas  verticals delivering services to the customers in their own sector have been considered as  service providers.  • Open-source organisations have been included in the category ‘Research and innovation  organisations’ when considered for their development activities at the ‘Think’ phase of the  lifecycle. They have been included in the category ‘Suppliers of MNOs’ when considered for  their support to technologies in production.  2.1.4 5G Security domains, objectives and measures  This section outlines the security dimensions of the 5G ecosystem used in this report. In the  absence of an equally comprehensive framework, the report uses the security domains,  objectives and measures found in the ENISA Guideline on Security Measures under the EECC  and its 5G supplement. The former concern security in general, the latter concern 5G. Although  they target mainly operators, the domains and measures set out in the documents above have  been used as an analytical framework. Still, it is important to stress that the security measures  used are not to be considered as the totality of the measures necessary for the mitigation of  cybersecurity risks in 5G. Security objectives and measures could be added for any sectoral risk  assessment covering a subset of the 5G ecosystem. The table below shows the security  domains and objectives taken into consideration. The mapping of the reference documents is  further broken down into security measures in Annex 6 Detailed mapping.  Figure 6: Security domains and objectives in the Guideline on Security Measures under EECC  and its 5G Supplement  Security domains (D) Security objectives  D1 – Governance and risk management  • Information security policy  • Governance and risk management  • Security roles and responsibilities  • Security of third-party dependencies  D2 – Human resources security  • Background checks  • Security knowledge and training  • Personnel changes  5G CYBERSECURITY STANDARDS  March 2022  16  • Handling violations  D3 – Security of systems and facilities  • Physical and environmental security  • Security of supplies  • Access control to network and information systems  • Integrity of network and information systems  • Use of encryption  • Protection of security critical data  D4 – Operations management  • Operational procedures  • Change management  • Asset management  D5 – Incident management  • Incident management procedures  • Incident detection capability  • Incident reporting and communication  D6 – Business continuity management  • Service continuity strategy and contingency plans  • Disaster recovery capabilities  D7 – Monitoring, auditing, and testing  • Monitoring and logging policies  • Exercise contingency plans  • Network and information systems testing  • Security assessments  • Compliance monitoring  D8 – Threat awareness  • Threat intelligence  • Informing users about threats  2.2 TAXONOMY OF DOCUMENTS CONSIDERED  To facilitate the analysis, this report relies on a taxonomy comprising three categories of  documents. Each of the documents considered is assigned to one of the categories below,  according to its related definition:  • Standard: a technical specification, adopted by a recognised standardisation body, for  repeated or continuous application, with which compliance is not compulsory5. The standards  considered are documents produced by a standardisation body (international, national or  European), and whose content include (but is not limited to) requirements, principles,  description of frameworks or processes and codes of practice.  • ICT Technical specification: a technical specification in the field of information and  communication technologies6. ICT technical specifications are referred in this document as  ‘specifications’.  • Guidelines and Best Practices: documents that explain, interpret and simplify […] standards  or […] standardisation deliverables. These can include user guides, abstracts of standards,  best practice information and awareness-building actions, strategies, and training  programmes7.  For convenience, the report refers to the documents analysed as, alternatively, ‘reference  documents’, ‘references’, ‘existing literature’ or ‘standards, specifications and guidelines.  5 Standardisation bodies as defined by Regulation (EU) No 1025/2012, 2012), Article 2 paragraph (1)  6 Understood as ‘ICT technical specification’ as defined by Regulation (EU) No 1025/2012, 2012), Article 2 paragraph (5)  7 Definition adapted from Regulation (EU) No 1025/2012, 2012) Chapter IV, Article 15, paragraph 1 Alinea (f). The  reference to ‘European’ standards and standardisation deliverables has been deleted as the current report refers also to  non-European documents.  5G CYBERSECURITY STANDARDS  March 2022  17  Although these categories have been identified solely for the purpose of the study, they are  based on the EU Regulation on European standardisation (Regulation (EU) No 1025/2012,  2012) and of the International Standardisation Organisation (ISO). A reminder of the exact  definitions is given in Annexes 1 and 2 on the taxonomy for standards.  Cybersecurity standards provide an important range of contents: requirements applicable to  ICT-related domains of technology or processes, requirements for management systems,  frameworks and guidelines on security controls about ‘what’ to do.  In turn, reference documents helping the implementation and the ‘how’ to do things relate to  specifications, guidelines, and best practices.  The documents analysed in this report are listed in the Annex 5 Referencing the Existing  Literature. An important part of the 5G-related documents in this study are referred in the report  from ENISA  Security in 5G Specifications (2021).  5G CYBERSECURITY STANDARDS  March 2022  18  3. POSITIONING AND  ASSESSMENT OF  REFERENCE DOCUMENTS IN  THE 5G ECOSYSTEM  3.1 METHODOLOGY FOR THE ASSESSMENT OF COVERAGE  This section provides the methodology to position existing standards, specifications and  guidelines in the 5G ecosystem and to assess the extent to which they address the 5G security  environment. It consists of the following steps:  • Using ENISA’s literature and complementary knowledge of the Expert Group missioned for  this study, relevant documents are sampled and grouped into consistent clusters (‘shorthand’)  made up of a selection of standards, specifications, and guidelines. The documents analysed  are listed in the Section 6 Bibliography.  • These clusters are mapped against each security domain, objective and measure of the 5G  ecosystem as described Section 2.1.4 5G Security domains, objectives and measures.  • The relevance and the completeness of the clusters is then analysed from the perspectives of  the three remaining dimensions of the 5G ecosystem, that is its stakeholders (Section 2.1.3  5G Stakeholders); its technical and functional domains (Section 2.1.1 5G technological and  functional domains); and the related technology lifecycle processes (Section 2.1.2 Technology  lifecycle processes).  • The results of the mapping and of the assessment are described in the section Annex 6  Detailed Mapping. A summarised version is contained in section 3.2 Consolidated Results.  3.2 CONSOLIDATED RESULTS  The detailed analysis underlying this report concerns more than 150 security measures and  more than 140 documents which were identified and selected from the available literature. This  detailed and in-depth analysis is provided in section Annex 6 Detailed Mapping.  Given the volume of information and the level of detail, the current section only contains a  summary table, representing the consolidated findings by security domain. A high-level  assessment of the extent to which the analysed literature addresses a given security domain for  each of the dimensions of the 5G ecosystem (i.e. stakeholders, technological and functional  domains, and technology lifecycle processes) is also provided.  Some details may not be obvious in the consolidated results. For example, ‘All’ under the  column ‘Coverage of Stakeholders’ means that the literature analysed is considered relevant for  every entity in the ecosystem. The specific degree or depth of relevance for each category of  stakeholders, technological and functional domains, and technology lifecycle processes is  tackled in the detailed mapping.  5G CYBERSECURITY STANDARDS  March 2022  19  Figure 7: Summary of the coverage of existing literature by security domain  Security domain  Taxonomy of  applicable  documents  Coverage of the dimensions of the 5G ecosystem  Observations  Stakeholders  5G Technological  and functional  domains  Technology lifecycle  processes  D1 – Governance  and risk  management  Standards All All All  The documents referred to are, to some extent, relevant to all  dimensions of the 5G ecosystem.

IDENTIFICATION OF GAPS  IN STANDARDISATION  4.1 METHODOLOGY FOR THE IDENTIFICATION OF GAPS IN THE  EXISTING LITERATURE  This section presents existing literature addressing each security domain in accordance with  Section 2.1.4 5G Security domains, objectives and measures from the perspective of the  stakeholder considered in accordance with Section 2.1.3 5G Stakeholders and points to the  areas partly covered by existing literature as well as those covered to a limited extent or not at  all.  The identification of these areas relies on expert assessment by the authors of this report. They  have assessed the extent to which the existing literature addresses an ‘ideal situation’ where  5G technical and organisational cybersecurity risks are mitigated and adequate controls to  ensure security are performed thanks to available standards, specifications, and guidelines.  This is therefore the reference against which gaps in standardisation have been identified.  4.2 ASSESSMENT OF COVERAGE AND IDENTIFICATION OF GAPS IN  STANDARDISATION  The assessment of the coverage of the standards, specification and guidelines considered, as  well as the identification of the gaps in standardisation, is conveyed in the form of a table  (Figure 9), which follows the colour coding below:  Figure 8: Colour coding for the representation of the gaps  Colour  code Definition  Existing literature  The green cells show the existing literature addressing each security domain from the perspective  of the stakeholder considered.  Moderate Gap  The yellow cells indicate the areas where moderate gaps in standardisation have been identified.  A gap is identified as ‘moderate’ when the existing literature addresses the domain partly, meaning  that moderate effort would be required to bridge that gap.  Major gap  The orange cells indicate the areas where major gaps in standardisation have been identified.  A gap is identified as ‘major’ when the existing literature does not address the domain (or only to a  limited extent), meaning that a major effort would be required to bridge that gap.  No gap/Not relevant  The cells that are not coloured indicate areas where no gaps have been identified or only those  that are not relevant for the stakeholder.  For research and innovation organisations, gaps are intended as areas where further work by  these organisations is required.  5G CYBERSECURITY STANDARDS  March 2022  22  For every domain, the table (Figure 9) identifies between brackets the relevant literature as  grouped by the shorthand in Annex 5 Referencing the existing literature, reproduced below for  convenience.

the standards, specifications and guidelines presented in Section  6 Bibliography.  The following should be noted.  • The bibliography relies on a sampled set of documents. Despite the authors’ efforts, there  may exist standards, specifications or guidelines that are not referenced and thus a gap is  reported in error.  • When a partial or major gap is pointed out, the question arises as to whether this area should  be standardised, supported by specifications or guidelines, or whether company-specific  needs make this contextualisation impossible.  Given the above, the present report might over-represent existing gaps in some areas. For  example, in relation to the latter point, one consistent observation is that the lifecycle of open- source software does not fit well with the processes defined in the standards, specifications,  and guidelines. This is mainly due to the lack of a formal organisational structure that could  support, enforce and finance standardised processes in the open-source community. This is  particularly true for the security domains D1 (Governance and Risk Management), D7  (Monitoring, Auditing and Testing) and D8 (Threat Awareness).  Furthermore, the process for developing security standards is not included in the analysis itself.  The interests of individual players may influence the definition of security standards,  specifications, or guidelines in favour of economic or other trade-offs – sometimes at the cost of  a higher risk. One example is the trade-off between capabilities for legal interception and  security against espionage through end-to-end confidentiality.  4.5 ADDITIONAL LEARNINGS AND OBSERVATIONS  Complementary to the assessment of the coverage of the existing security literature, the  following elements intend to bring a qualitative perspective on the organisational and technical  5G CYBERSECURITY STANDARDS  March 2022  30  areas where the 5G stakeholders can intervene to improve maturity, robustness, and readiness  for resilience.  The following list gathers observations from the initial deployments of 4G that have been shared  in the Telecom industry. These trends continue to be relevant and should be considered in the  context of 5G8:  • The complexity of simultaneously operating virtualised infrastructure and virtualised  network functions (VNFs) working together;  • The need for consistency between the three key technical domains of VNFs (Virtual  Network Functions), SDN (Software-defined networks) controllers, IaaS (Infrastructure  as a Service) due to their mutual dependencies;  • The reliance on a Linux kernel leading to a systemic risk related to unexpected  changes of configuration or unexpected behaviours at the core of computing and  connectivity capabilities, possibly impacting also new critical functions e.g.  orchestration, containers and microservices;  • The emergence of new solutions to entrust data management on cloud-based and  serverless solutions, based on short-lived assets requiring new approaches for the  observability of actions and for detecting threats;  • New cloud environments impact identity and access management as they are no  longer purely role-based, but attribute-based and context-based;  • The increased need for confidentiality and resilience on connectivity and data storage  in the network and its operation;  • The exploding number of cryptographic certificates to ensure legitimacy and avoid  man-in-the-middle attacks shine a new light on key management;  • The abundance of configurations using text-based descriptors such as JSON and  XML, together with highly distributed processing and storage;  • The effects of the increased importance of IT technologies including the importance of  open source, both at service and infrastructure levels;  • The large number of APIs bringing complexity in ensuring the legitimacy of requests  and the balance between attack surface and the exposure of an application interface;  • Cybersecurity incidents involving the recurring exposure of credentials and secrets in  CI/CD environments;  • The MNOs’ tendency to outsource their network operations and field operations to  third-party service providers entrusted with multiple networks in multiple countries,  which reinforces the importance of connectivity and therefore the inter-dependency  between the ability to operate and the operated assets;  • Outsourcing to ‘tower companies’ (companies taking charge of the radio access sites)  and ‘fibre companies’ (companies that operate fibre access networks), which are now  entrusted with managing several operators simultaneously in several countries.  The above key trends are observed in 4G, but they should be taken into consideration to  improve the coverage of standardisation for the cybersecurity of 5G.  Furthermore, one should take into account the fact that 5G networks are ‘systems of systems’,  whose representation requires automation and abstraction and whose services necessitate end- to-end quality controls.  8 (Affirmed Networks, 2019)  5G CYBERSECURITY STANDARDS  March 2022  31  5. RECOMMENDATIONS  This section provides the recommendations that result from the previous sections and in  particular from the identification of gaps.  5.1 ADOPT A PROGRESSIVE APPROACH TO 5G STANDARDISATION  The report suggests that a progressive approach to 5G standardisation be undertaken. Such an  approach should start by improving existing literature. The current report could help this effort as  it gives an overview of references and assesses their suitability for a given security measure,  technical and functional domain and/or stakeholder. The creation of new references – if needed  – could be a subsequent step to enhance standardisation coverage.  5.2 HAVE A BROADER VIEW ON THE CREATION OF NEW REFERENCES  The creation of new standards, specifications and guidelines should consider several elements.  • Usefulness and necessity. It should be considered whether the creation of standards,  specifications and guidelines is necessary and/or useful for a specific security measure, for a  specific 5G domain, and/or for a specific stakeholder at a given stage of the lifecycle.  • Link with strategic objectives. It is recommended that a consistent link between any new  reference and the strategic objective it should serve is ensured. For instance, if the objective  of a new reference is to harmonise practices at the European level, local regulations should  be taken into consideration. For example, contextualisation of HR (human resources)  measures must account for local regulations. A special attention shall be brought to provisions  for legal interception.  • Measurability of effectiveness. New references should facilitate the consistent measuring of  the effectiveness of the security measures from an end-to-end service perspective.  • Consideration for new technologies. For example, detection tactics of incidents in 5G should  be tackled also from the perspective of the development and operation of Artificial Intelligence,  and not only from the standpoints of mobile network operators, their managed services  provider, and B2B verticals.  • Thinking beyond standardisation. In some cases, the effectiveness of standards,  specifications or guidelines depends on external factors. For example, because of the open  nature of the development of free and open source software (FOSS), security guidelines and  recommendations should be accompanied by the commitment of resources to development  and audit. Therefore, industry players and public administrations relying on open source  software should be encouraged to actively contribute to continuously improve and maintain  the security of the FOSS-based solutions.  5.3 FOSTER THE MATURITY AND THE COMPLETENESS OF THE  IDENTIFICATION AND ASSESSMENT OF RISK  Section 4 Identification of Gaps in Standardisation points to areas, for each security domain,  that are partly covered by the existing literature, as well as those covered to a limited extent or  not at all. Besides these specific areas, the experts observed a broader gap related to risk  assessment. The existing literature related to risk assessment is not specific to 5G and/or does  not identify and evaluate risks consistently. This leads to a fragmented security landscape which  might be detrimental for the overall security of 5G.  5G CYBERSECURITY STANDARDS  March 2022  32  Therefore, it is important to foster the maturity and the completeness of risk identification and  assessment, by harmonising risk assessment practices in a way that is inclusive of all  stakeholders of the 5G ecosystem. For example, this would imply in particular (but not only)  standardised:  • registers of risks, including from the perspective of the telecommunications sector and service  customers,  • skills and capacities frameworks for third party assessment,  • knowledge bases of threat scenarios,  • requirements for security monitoring,  • assessment methods with an adequate abstraction level,  • requirements for auditing capability, in particular for service providers.  In this context, it is worth mentioning the approach to risk identification outlined in ENISA’s  Methodology for Sectoral Cybersecurity Assessment, and described in the subsequent section.  5.3.1 ENISA’s methodology for sectoral cybersecurity assessment  The European Cybersecurity Act (CSA) obliges to the definition of security and certification  requirements for ICT products, services and processes to be based on the risk associated with  their intended use.  To this end, ENISA has proposed the SCSA methodology (ENISA Methodology for Sectoral  Cybersecurity Assessments, 2021) to support the identification of cybersecurity risks associated  with the intended use of systems in the context of business services and processes, with the  option to involve all stakeholders from sectoral vertical users to the providers of network  infrastructure. SCSA carries out the assessment at sectoral business level involving all relevant  5G stakeholders, their business objectives and their ICT subsystems and processes.  Cybersecurity risks are identified in relation to the business objectives and the risks identified  indicate the security, certification and assurance level requirements for particular ICT products,  services and processes. This can support a balance between the cost that a 5G stakeholder  has to cover for security and assurance and the benefit of protecting his business objectives.  5.4 FINAL OBSERVATIONS  It is to be noted that the prioritisation of new references to be created is outside the scope of  this work and that, in accordance with the previous recommendation, the creation of new  references might not always be necessary and should be part of a progressive approach which  should consider several aspects.  Finally, it is important to stress that, while the technical and organisational standards analysed  can contribute to the security of 5G, they should not be treated as an exhaustive list of  measures guaranteeing security. Besides considerations of the effectiveness of specific  standards that are outside the scope this report, it should be reminded that there are risks that  are not covered by standards, for example residual risks whose cost is neither borne by nor  attributable to a specific stakeholder, such as societal risks resulting from network malfunctions.  The complexity of 5G, as depicted in the previous sections, calls for a comprehensive vision of  trust and of resilience that goes beyond standardisation. This vision should be future-proof and  not dependent on the variability of assets and configurations in the network.  5G CYBERSECURITY STANDARDS  March 2022  33  6.

A.1 DOCUMENT TYPOLOGIES DEFINED BY THE EU REGULATION  The European Union’s Regulation (EU) No 1025/2012, 2012 stipulates the following provisions:  A Technical specification is a document that prescribes technical requirements to be fulfilled  by a product, process, service or system (..).  Depending on the source of such specification, it could be a standard (standard means a  technical specification adopted by a recognised standardisation body for repeated or continuous  application) at the international, regional (e.g. European) or national level.  Additionally, there is the European standardisation deliverable, which refers to any technical  specification other than a European standard adopted by a European standardisation  organisation for repeated or continuous application.  Technical specifications, not being standards nor European standardisation deliverables, could  be identified as equivalent to standards if they meet the requirements set up in Annex II of  Regulation 1025/2012.  If the taxonomy based on EU Regulation 1025/2012 were considered it could look like:  A. Technical specification – document containing the requirements for:  A1 – Technical specification – standard  A2 – Technical specification – European standardisation deliverable considered as a standard  (adopted by one of the European Standards Organisations)  A3 – Technical Specification – standard (according to the rules and principles set up in Annex II  of the Regulation)  B. Document that contains information other than requirements:  B1 – (Name of a Recognised Standardisation Body) standard – Framework  B2 – (Name of a Recognised Standardisation Body) standard – Guidelines  B3 – (Name of a Recognised Standardisation Body) standard – Best practices  B4 – (Name of a Recognised Standardisation Body) standard – Vocabulary  A.2 DOCUMENT TYPOLOGIES DEFINED BY ISO  If we consider the ISO taxonomy we are dealing with the following (according to ISO):  Standard: is a document established by consensus and approved by a recognised body that  provides for common and repeated use rules, guidelines or characteristics for activities or their  results, aimed at the achievement of the optimum degree of order in a given context.  International Standard: is a standard that is adopted by an international standardising or  standards organisation and made available to the public.  5G CYBERSECURITY STANDARDS  March 2022  38  Technical Specification (TS): is a document published by ISO or IEC for which there is, in the  future, the possibility of agreement on an International Standard but for which at present:  • the required support for approval as an International Standard cannot be obtained,  • there is doubt on whether consensus has been achieved,  • the subject matter is still under technical development, or  • there is another reason precluding immediate publication as an International Standard.  Technical Report (TR): is a document published by ISO or IEC containing collected data of a  different kind from that normally published by ISO or IEC.  If the ISO taxonomy were considered it could look like:  A. Standards  A1 – (Name of a Recognised Standardisation Body) Standard – Requirements  A2 – (Name of a Recognised Standardisation Body) Standard – Framework  A3 – (Name of a Recognised Standardisation Body) Standard – Guidelines  A4 – (Name of a Recognised Standardisation Body) Standard – Vocabulary  B. Technical reports  B1 – ISO Technical Report – Guidelines  B2 – ISO Technical Report – Best practices  C. Non-standard documents  C1  – (Name of the Issuer) – Guidelines  C2  – (Name of the Issuer) – Best Practices  5G CYBERSECURITY STANDARDS  March 2022  39  ANNEX – MAPPING  In the detailed analysis, to keep the information in the table manageable, the convention used in  this annex is proposed to refer to one or several stakeholders, one or several documents, under  a common label.

In addition,  consumers of 5G services without a business relation with a  5G service provider (e.g. end users) are included in this  category.  This category may implement standards, specifications  and guidelines to achieve the security objectives for the  safe use, deployment and operation of 5G networks and/or  services.  Telecommunications sector (Telecom)  This category encompasses entities that are responsible for  the manufacture, deployment and operation of 5G networks,  such as:  • Mobile network operators: entities providing mobile  network services to users, operating their own  network, if necessary with the help of third parties.  • Suppliers of mobile networks: entities providing  services or infrastructure to MNOs in order to build  and/or operate their networks (both telecom  equipment manufacturers and other third-party  suppliers, such as cloud infrastructure providers and  network infrastructure providers and managed  services providers).  • Service provider (SP): entities that design, build and  operate services using aggregated network services  such as, for example, communication service  providers offering traditional telecom services, digital  service providers offering digital services such as  enhanced mobile broadband and IoT to various  vertical industries, or network slice as a service  (NSaaS) providers offering a network slice along with  the services that it may support and configure.  • Virtualisation infrastructure service providers (VISP):  entities that provide virtualised infrastructure services  and that design, build and operate virtualisation  infrastructure(s). The infrastructure comprises  networking (e.g. for mobile transport) and computing  resources (e.g. from computing platforms).  This category may implement standards, specifications  and guidelines to achieve the security objectives for the  safe use, deployment and operation of 5G networks and/or  services.  Datacentre services providers (DCSP)  Entities that provide data centre services and that design, build  and operate their data centres. A DCSP differs from a VISP by  offering ’raw’ resources (i.e. host servers) in rather centralised  locations and simple services for consumption of these raw  resources. A VISP rather offers access to a variety of  resources by aggregating multiple technology domains and  making them accessible through a single API.  This category may implement standards, specifications  and guidelines to achieve the security objectives for the  safe use, deployment and operation of 5G networks and/or  services.  Connected devices industry  This category includes manufacturers of connected devices  and related service providers, meaning entities providing  objects or services that will connect to 5G networks (e.g.  smartphones, connected vehicles, e-health) and related  service components hosted in a 5G control plane as defined in  service-based architecture or mobile edge computing.  This category may implement standards, specifications  and guidelines to achieve the security objectives for the  safe use, deployment and operation of 5G networks and/or  services.  5G CYBERSECURITY STANDARDS  March 2022  41  Cybersecurity assessment  This category includes entities that assess the security of 5G  networks and systems e.g. auditing companies and accredited  5G laboratories.  This category audits the implementation of standards,  specifications and guidelines.  Cybersecurity information exchange  This category includes entities that share threat intelligence  and incident-related information, for example information  sharing and analysis centres (ISACs) and cyber security  incident response team (CSIRTs).  This category may implement standards, specifications  and guidelines to securely exchange cyber-intelligence.  Standards development organisations (SDOs),  associations, alliances  This category encompasses entities that develop and  promote the adoption of standards, specifications and  guidelines, for example GSMA and 3GPP.  Research and innovation organisations  This category encompasses entities contributing to R&D and  innovation tasks related to all kinds of innovative actions in the  areas related to 5G, including verticals. It also includes open  source organisations or communities providing technological  support and guidance in the development of 5G functions and  services, as well as public-private partnerships and innovation  programmes.  This category exposes gaps in standardisation and  creates innovations that can lead to advancements in  standardisation, by acting as starting points for new  standards, specifications and guidelines.  5G CYBERSECURITY STANDARDS  March 2022  42  A.5 REFERENCING THE EXISTING LITERATURE  In the detailed analysis, to keep the information in the detailed analysis table manageable, a  convention specific to this document is proposed for referring to one or several documents  under a common cluster for easy reference.

The columns of this table are explained hereunder:  Security  measure  Applicable  documents  taxonomy  Reference to  the documents  Coverage of  stakeholders  Coverage of 5G  technological  and functional  domains  Coverage of  lifecycle  processes  List of the 5G  security  measures per  security domain  and objectives  as defined in  Section 2.1.4 5G  Security  domains,  objectives and  measures.  The detailed  mapping  distinguishes  general security  measures and  5G-specific  ones.  The taxonomy of  the reference  documents.  This column is  intended to keep  the reader  aware of what  the literature  group is about.  A standard and  a specification  tend to express  ‘What to do’ or  ‘Security  features’,  whereas a  guideline tends  to provide  elements on the  ’How to  implement  security’, closer  to  considerations  of the build and  the run.  This is described  in Section 2.2  Taxonomy of  Documents  Considered  A group name to  designate  several literature  references  identified as  matching (but  not necessary  fulfilling) the  purpose of the  security  measure. The  group names  are described in  Annex 6.A.5  referencing the  existing  literature  A group name  designating  stakeholders of  the 5G  ecosystem  covered by the  literature  identified. The  group names  are described in  Annex 6.A.4  referencing the  stakeholders  A group name  referring to the  5G domains  covered by the  literature  identified. The  5G domains are  grouped  according to  Annex 6.A.3  referencing the  5G technical  and functional  domains  Lifecycle  processes  covered by the  literature  identified. The  lifecycle  processes are  provided in  Section 2.1.2  Technology  lifecycle  processes.  The conventions for the comments used in the detailed analysis are as follows.  ‘All’: the reference document is considered applicable to every entity in the ecosystem, at  various degrees and at different depths. The specific degree or depth of applicability to each  entity are not assessed here.  ‘Not put into context and not immediately actionable’ means that the reference document is  generic and may be applied to the entity. Further work is required to tailor it to the specific  context.  The coverage of the references has been assessed by considering how they can be used to  serve given security measures. When the reference only mentions the security measure without  providing a specific relevant tool for its implementation, the reference is not mentioned.  5G CYBERSECURITY STANDARDS  March 2022  51  D1 - GOVERNANCE AND RISK MANAGEMENT  SO 1 - Information security policy  Security measure  Applicable  documents  taxonomy  Reference to  the  documents  Coverage of  stakeholders  Coverage of 5G  technological and  functional domains  Coverage of  lifecycle processes  Set a high-level security  policy addressing the  security of networks and  services.

It  poses threats with a high impact on the data, information technology systems and networks that  form the dorsal spine of modern societies. This shortage can be further analysed into two  concurrent issues: a quantitative one and a qualitative one. The quantitative issue is related to  the insufficient supply of cybersecurity professionals to meet the requirements of the job market  and the qualitative one is related to the inadequacy of professional skills to meet the market’s  needs.  This report focuses on the status of the cybersecurity education system and the inability to  attract more students to study cybersecurity and to produce graduates with the right  cybersecurity knowledge and skills. It argues that many of the current issues in cybersecurity  education could be ameliorated by redesigning educational and training pathways that define  knowledge and skills that students should possess upon graduation and after entering the  labour market.  This analysis describes how four states — Australia, France, the United Kingdom and the  United States — have attempted to rethink cybersecurity degrees using certification. These  certification schemes have been established for various purposes. The main objectives include  having more graduates with skills readily deployable by the industry, helping employers  understand skills and knowledge that students have developed in their academic careers, and  assisting people to choose their degree options. The ultimate impact of degree certification is to  reduce the CSSS through the promotion of cybersecurity education, research and awareness.  Currently, 387 cybersecurity degrees have been certified by the national authorities of these  four states. Although processes and criteria differ, certifications share some commonalities:   a specific focus and enough credits dedicated specifically to cybersecurity courses and  activities,   a structured curriculum, possibly with a practical/training component or specific types of  examinations and activities such as cybersecurity competitions,   a high-quality teaching faculty, which might include lecturers from industry,   a broader multi-/interdisciplinary focus,   external outreach activities and collaborations with the rest of the national cybersecurity  ecosystem,   information on degrees’ educational and employment outcomes.  In this context, ENISA has created the Cybersecurity Higher Education Database, an  interactive-list of cybersecurity degrees in EEA countries and Switzerland. The Database aims  to become the main point of reference for all European citizens looking to upskill their  cybersecurity knowledge and skills through a higher education degree. By checking the  Database, citizens should be able to make more informed decisions about cybersecurity  education and training, choosing the degree that is most suitable to their needs. In determining  what information workers and employers might find most useful, the Database has drawn  significantly from both the scientific literature (Section 3 of this report) and the criteria that are  used by national authorities when accrediting degrees (Section 4).  CYBERSECURITY SKILLS DEVELOPMENT IN THE EU  December 2019  4  There are three main considerations that this report sets forth:   Certification of cybersecurity degrees (as illustrated in Section 4) could be beneficial in  the design of a comprehensive cybersecurity workforce development strategy. It could  be a significant first step mainly because it clarifies what knowledge and skills the education  system is supposed to instil and, consequently, what employers can expect when students  graduate and apply for a job in their organisations. Future research is essential to identify the  key benefits of certifications for students and employers and if they effectively provide a more  skilled workforce.   However, determining what the right knowledge and skills means is only part of a much  wider problem, which is compounded by several other factors. Although certification  could be a step in the right direction, it cannot be considered the only solution to the shortage.  The CSSS is both a qualitative and a quantitative issue, and it should be tackled accordingly.  Increasing the quality of cybersecurity graduates through certified degrees is certainly useful  to make potential job candidates more employable, but not sufficient if the pipeline of  professionals is not plentiful enough to guarantee that job vacancies are filled. Future  research should identify what policies are able to incentivise seemingly large swaths of  students to enter academic and learning paths more conducive to cybersecurity careers.   Finally, and despite the focus of this report, policies should go beyond initiatives that  solely target national education and training systems. Policies would benefit greatly from  incorporating measures dealing with issues that are generated on the demand side of the  labour market. Currently, there is ample evidence suggesting that the CSSS is affected by  problems that originate from the demand side of the labour market equation, such as  employers’ unwillingness to invest in cybersecurity human capital, and high-level entry  requirements. Because of that, it would be particularly promising to find solutions easing the  transition from the education system into the labour market and thus encourage employers to  become systematic players in the development of a national cybersecurity workforce.  In the light of these considerations, this report recommends further investigating the following:   The impact of cybersecurity degree certification on the cybersecurity skills shortage. A  rigorous and systematic analysis of the implementation and outcomes of already established  national certifications can provide insights into potential best practices that can be  implemented in other countries;   The uptake and promotion of ENISA’s Cybersecurity Higher Education Database. The  Database will be a useful instrument for citizens and employers only if it includes most  cybersecurity degrees in the EU. If this is achieved, it will also enable further analysis of the  changing state of EU cybersecurity education.   The nature and characteristics of the cybersecurity skills shortage in the EU. This report  aggregates the available data to gain a better understanding of the CSSS in the EU, but also  notes the lack of granular and essential information. As the design of policies to mitigate the  shortage should be preceded by a full understanding of it, there are still too many gaps in  knowledge that should be filled.   The policy interventions that are most effective in increasing the pipeline of  professionals. To make sure the shortage is addressed both as a quantitative and a  qualitative issue, mitigation strategies should include measures that ensure the pipeline of  professionals is effectively augmented. There are policies that have been deployed to  increase interest in cybersecurity careers, and more needs to be known about the extent to  which these programmes have been successful and if they could be scaled up to meet the  growing labour market demand.  CYBERSECURITY SKILLS DEVELOPMENT IN THE EU  December 2019  5   How to design comprehensive cybersecurity workforce development strategies that go  beyond policies targeting only the education and training system. Such strategies should  promote the role of active employers in developing a national cybersecurity workforce.  Although some comprehensive strategies addressing the shortage have been established,  most of the attention has been directed towards spurring changes in higher education. More is  needed to create a virtuous cycle that guarantees a good match between the supply of  workers and the requirements of jobs, taking into account the primary role that employers  should have in sustaining the cybersecurity workforce. In this respect, ENISA can play a role  as a community builder and make sure all stakeholders’ needs are addressed in the process.  CYBERSECURITY SKILLS DEVELOPMENT IN THE EU  December 2019  6  1. INTRODUCTION  The cybersecurity skills shortage (CSSS) is the lack of qualified cybersecurity professionals in  the labour market (McGuinness, Pouliakas, & Redmond, 2018). This is usually characterised by  unfilled or hard-to-fill vacancies and raises in the wages that professionals with relevant skills in  and knowledge of cybersecurity can command.  The shortfall of a cybersecurity workforce capable of handling cybersecurity tasks represents an  issue for both economic development and national security. The rapid digitisation of the global  economy means that data, networks and systems have become the spine of modern societies.  Threats to their confidentiality, integrity or availability suggest that countries might see their  economic flourishing being hampered (The Council of Economic Advisers, 2018). Moreover,  cybersecurity issues have been elevated to national security threats (Bate, 2017). Having  realised the negative consequences that the escalation of cybersecurity attacks might have  even in the offline world, countries have been proactively preparing countermeasures to  counteract malign operations, while meeting in international fora to agree on norms of  acceptable behaviour in cyberspace.  Hence, having enough professionals to secure information systems is becoming an absolute  priority for policymakers, as is often expressed in countries’ cybersecurity strategies (De Zan,  2019).  The cybersecurity skill shortage is a multidimensional policy issue that is compounded by  several factors. Among these is that the relevant stakeholders — government, academia and  industry — have expressed the need to redesign educational and training pathways and, by  doing that, to define the right cybersecurity knowledge and skills that students should be  equipped with once they graduate with a degree in cybersecurity. In the context of the shortage,  employers lament that is hard for them to recognise the skills that potential cybersecurity  candidates have, or to find them at all. Therefore, getting stakeholders to agree on what these  right cybersecurity knowledge and skills are is an important step to overcome one of the major  hurdles that is currently impeding the establishment of a sustained cybersecurity workforce.  The aim of this report is to analyse what policies countries have adopted to determine the  cybersecurity knowledge and skills that students should have acquired before graduating with a  cybersecurity degree. This research uses the experiences of four states — Australia, France,  the United Kingdom and the United States — and describes the processes and criteria through  which these states certify their national cybersecurity degrees.  Subsequently, this report explains how this information was used as input to the creation of the  Cybersecurity Higher Education Database, whose goal is to become the premier source of  information for EU citizens looking to brush up their cybersecurity knowledge and skills. It has  the ultimate goal of linking citizens with high-quality cybersecurity degrees and therefore of  closing information gaps that have the potential to worsen the CSSS.  This report is organised as follows:   Section 2 defines the cybersecurity skills shortage and explains the major factors behind it;   Section 3 delves into the origins of one of the causes of the shortage, explaining why major  stakeholders seem to agree on the need to set standards for cybersecurity degrees through  certification;  This report  focuses on the  state of the  cybersecurity  education and  actions to be  taken in order  to form  graduates with  the right  cybersecurity  knowledge  and skills.  CYBERSECURITY SKILLS DEVELOPMENT IN THE EU  December 2019  7   Section 4 reports the processes and criteria that Australia, France, the United Kingdom and  the United States have established to certify cybersecurity degrees;   Section 5 describes EU policies in digital and cybersecurity education and the creation of the  Cybersecurity Higher Education Database;   Section 6 discusses the implications of establishing certification for cybersecurity degrees and  gives some recommendations on activities and/or research that could be implemented to  enhance our understanding of the shortage, to mitigate it more effectively.  CYBERSECURITY SKILLS DEVELOPMENT IN THE EU  December 2019  8  2. THE CYBERSECURITY  SKILLS SHORTAGE  This section attempts to clarify the nature of the CSSS by presenting the available evidence on  this issue. First it introduces general information on the CSSS worldwide, and then it focuses on  the shortage in the EU. This section makes the point that the shortage can be attributed to  various causes, including employers and workplace malpractice, but also some issues  concerning cybersecurity education, which will be thoroughly presented in Section 3.  2.1 THE CYBERSECURITY SKILLS SHORTAGE WORLDWIDE  There are various indicators suggesting that cybersecurity is one of the most constrained sectors  in the labour market. Figures based on the US market (Burningglass, 2019) shows that in 2019:   cybersecurity job postings had increased by 94 % since 2013, while information technology  (IT) vacancies had increased by only 30 %;   cybersecurity jobs accounted for 13 % of all IT jobs, but their salaries commanded a 16 %  premium over other IT ones (1);   cybersecurity vacancies also took 20 % longer to fill than those in other IT occupations;   the ratio of currently employed cybersecurity professionals to vacancies had not changed  since 2015-16, being stable at 2.3, whereas by comparison there were 5.8 employed workers  for any other job in the economy (2).  Although results should be interpreted with caution (3), industry research almost unanimously  concludes that a CSSS is well established.  The 2019 annual report by the Enterprise Strategy Group and the Information Systems Security  Association (Oltsik, 2019) claims that the CSSS has an impact on 74 % of organisations. The  main consequences of the CSSS are increased workload on existing staff, inability to train or to  learn new technologies, and aggressive recruitment tactics by headhunters to secure talented  professionals.  Similarly, the Information Systems Audit and Control Association (ISACA, 2019) found that 58 %  of organisations have unfilled cybersecurity vacancies and that for 60 % of them it takes a  minimum of 3 months before a position is filled. The main reason that these positions remain  unfilled is the apparent lack of qualified professionals applying; 29 % of organisations report that  fewer than 25 % of candidates are well qualified for the job.  Finally, the 2019 cybersecurity workforce study by the International Information System Security  Certification Consortium ((ISC)², 2019) estimated the current global shortage to be around 4.07  million professionals and that the workforce would need to grow by 145 % to meet labour  market demand. In the survey, approximately 65 % of organisations declare they have a  shortage of staff for cybersecurity tasks; among cybersecurity professionals, the lack of skilled  and experienced cybersecurity security personnel is the top concern; finally, 51 % of  1 The average advertised salary was almost USD 94 000.  2 These statistics are probably more representative of the US than the EU cybersecurity labour market.  3 Industry research employing surveys falls short of providing strong scientific results on the incidence of the CSSS. These  surveys are beleaguered by serious methodological issues to such an extent that caution should be exercised when using  these data to design public policies. Issues include non-randomisation of the population surveyed, poor choice of indicators  and doubtful quantification of the shortage at the international level. However, this research is useful insofar as it underlines  a policy issue that has been underinvestigated and needs careful consideration from both researchers and policymakers.  CYBERSECURITY SKILLS DEVELOPMENT IN THE EU  December 2019  9  organisations claim that, because of the lack of personnel, they are at moderate-extreme risk of  suffering a security breach.  2.2 THE CYBERSECURITY SKILLS SHORTAGE IN THE EUROPEAN  UNION  There is a lack of data on the CSSS in the EU, but the most specific information can usually be  found in selected industry reports, in a number of national policy documents and in locally  conducted research.  In 2017, the European Commission suggested that the main reason why some Member States  had been better able to establish computer emergency response teams was a ‘cybersecurity  skills gap’ throughout the EU. Indeed, consultations with Member States had identified a  ‘cybersecurity awareness and skills gap in the population’ as being among the key obstacles to  building a secure cyberspace. Notwithstanding the availability of almost 500 university and  training courses across Europe, ‘the cybersecurity skills gap across all sectors remains a major  challenge and the talent pool is not keeping up the pace’(4)  The 2019 (ISC)² cybersecurity workforce study ((ISC)², 2019) asserted that there is a shortage  of approximately 291 000 cybersecurity professionals in Europe up from the previous estimate  of 142 000 professionals that had been given in the 2018 report.  This result is complemented by what participants in a Symantec CISO Forum said in February  2019 (Symantec, 2019), when they concluded that hiring cybersecurity personnel takes at least  6 months, with between 9 and 12 months not being unusual. On a similar note, a survey  commissioned by the cybersecurity firm Trend Micro (Trend Micro, 2019) discovered that 33 %  of 1 125 chief information security officers in the United States and the EU have difficulty hiring  new talent and 49 % believe this might expose their organisations to greater risks.  More alarmingly, IT professionals in Germany, France and the United Kingdom and around the  world are convinced that the shortage of cybersecurity personnel is here to stay, as they predict  that an average of 16 % cybersecurity vacancies may go unfilled by 2020 (CSIS, 2016).  Besides industry reports, statements from governments and evidence from research conducted  nationally indicate that various Member States of the EU have similar labour market issues in  the cybersecurity sector.  Table 1: Quotes on the cybersecurity skills shortage in the EU  Member State Government statements Other reports  Italy  ‘Italy has a vast problem in relation  to cybersecurity education.’  (Presidenza del Consiglio dei  Ministri, 2018)  ‘Italy seems to be affected by the  same challenges that are impeding a  smooth match between cybersecurity  supply and demand as in other  countries.’ (De Zan, 2019)  France  ‘The content and number of initial  training and higher education  programmes for cybersecurity  professions do not meet the needs of  businesses and administrations.’  (Premier Ministre, 2015)  ‘Cybersecurity faces a constant talent  shortage. While French companies  and administrations are becoming  aware of cybersecurity challenges,  more than 5 000 jobs are currently  available in this sector in France.’  (PwC, 2019)  4 https://ec.europa.eu/transparency/regdoc/rep/other/SWD-2017-295-F1-EN-0-0.PDF  https://ec.europa.eu/transparency/regdoc/rep/other/SWD-2017-295-F1-EN-0-0.PDF  CYBERSECURITY SKILLS DEVELOPMENT IN THE EU  December 2019  10  Germany -  ‘The shortage of IT security specialists  no longer affects only the economy,  but also increasingly the public  sector.’ (Schuetze, 2018)  Netherlands  ‘There is a growing demand from the  business community and public  authorities for innovative solutions to  cybersecurity issues and well-trained  personnel. This shortage on the  labour market leads to scarce  cybersecurity knowledge in  organizations, which makes them  insufficiently resilient to digital  threats.’ (National Coordinator for  Security & Counterterrorism, 2018)  ‘Many organizations experience a  shortage of cybersecurity  professionals.’ (Centraal Planbureau,  2018)  Spain  ‘Spain should have technical and  human resources to give it the  necessary technological autonomy  and appropriate skills training for  secure use of cyberspace, making  cybersecurity the key enabler for an  entrepreneurial nation.’ (Presidencia  del Gobierno, 2019)  ‘The lack of professionals specialised  in cybersecurity is one of the main  challenges currently facing both the  public and private sectors in the  current environment.’ (Europa Press,  2017)  United Kingdom  “The challenge is much more complex  than simply a shortage of  cybersecurity professionals — there is  a broader cybersecurity capability gap  in the UK.’ (HM Government, 2018)  “Of the 1.32 million UK businesses,  we estimate that around 710,000 have  a basic technical cybersecurity skills  gap and 407,000 have a high-level  technical cybersecurity skills gap.’  (Pedley, McHenry, Motha, & Navin,  2018)  2.3 THE CAUSES OF THE SHORTAGE  Four main causes might be attributed to the cybersecurity skills shortage Two of them can be  broadly credited to issues within the workplace and exacerbated by employers, while the  remaining two are associated with issues affecting the education and training system (5).This  section provides evidence on the former, and the next section is focused on the latter.  Two elements that compound the shortage can be attributed to employers or more generally to  the labour market. The first one is the high expectations that employers have about the skill  level of candidates that the current labour market can offer, while the second one is the lack of  sufficient and suitable training provided to employees.  The cybersecurity job market is relatively immature and very dynamic, and the job specifications  are highly dependent on the organisation size and sector. In particular, the job specifications are  different if the organisation operates outside the cybersecurity industry. In this case, recruitment  in cybersecurity roles is rare and mostly limited to large firms (Pedley, McHenry, Motha, &  Navin, 2018).  Small and medium-sized enterprises not specialised in job security tend to prefer generalist IT  staff with some understanding of cybersecurity, whereas larger firms and firms specialised in  cybersecurity have need of specialised staff focused on one of the subdisciplines of  cybersecurity (6).  5 See https://www.newamerica.org/cybersecurity-initiative/reports/cybersecurity-workforce-development/.  6 The types of advanced professional roles are wide ranging, representing the diversity of the industries and the services  required by the outsourcing company. Some of the typical job roles required by the market include security architecture,  security engineering, security operation, forensic analysis and penetration testing.  https://www.newamerica.org/cybersecurity-initiative/reports/cybersecurity-workforce-development/  CYBERSECURITY SKILLS DEVELOPMENT IN THE EU  December 2019  11  In the United Kingdom, businesses believe that the shortage has its origins in the novelty and  immaturity of cybersecurity as a profession, the lack of graduates in science, technology,  engineering and mathematics (STEM)-related disciplines, and the poor awareness of  cybersecurity as a career option. In observing that employers value experience more than  academic degrees, it is, however, recognised that businesses should do more to equip students  with hands-on experience through internships and apprenticeships (De Zan, 2019).  Furthermore, employers are not offering the right level of training, which is stymieing both the  creation of a sustained workforce pipeline and the professional development of current  employees. If training is not offered, junior or mid-level professionals with a more general  background, but no specialised knowledge and skills in cybersecurity, cannot further develop  the necessary intellectual, managerial and technological skills to perform their daily activities.  So, if adequate training is not provided, professionals will probably not be able to keep up with  the pace of constant innovation at which their adversaries run. As a senior decision-maker  within the EU puts it:  The shortage is really dominated by a lack of understanding and adaption on our way of training  people and fostering their development in the industry based on the way cybersecurity is  evolving. Anonymous interview, (De Zan, 2019) p.37  Therefore, employers have potentially a very important role to play in reducing the current  shortage and this should be carefully considered when designing cybersecurity workforce  development policies.  Nonetheless, there are at least two other factors worsening the CSSS that can be attributed to  issues within the education and training system. One is the inability to encourage more students  to enter academic pathways that are more easily associated with a cybersecurity job; the other  is the failure to produce candidates with the right knowledge and skills.  The next section provides an overview of the issues that academia, industry and governments  have found to be afflicting cybersecurity education, with a particular focus on the difficulties that  academia faces in equipping graduates with cybersecurity knowledge and skills that would  make them more employable in the labour market.  CYBERSECURITY SKILLS DEVELOPMENT IN THE EU  December 2019  12  3. CHALLENGES IN  CYBERSECURITY  EDUCATION AND TRAINING  This section provides an overview of the status of cybersecurity education, highlighting the  major issues that stakeholders from governments, academia and the industry have noted about  the field (7).  The European Cyber Security Organisation argues that governments should tackle the  cybersecurity skills gap through more educational and training offers. Curriculum designers are  failing to realise the importance of having a multidisciplinary curriculum. (European Cyber  Security Organisation, 2018) To be able to do their job well, professionals need an  understanding of a variety of cybersecurity knowledge areas, ranging from more technical topics  to social and legal aspects. Whereas it is true that universities should not be training for the  labour market, the educational and training system should ensure the employability of students.  Consequently, one of the objectives of the educational and training system should be to give  students a holistic understanding of cybersecurity, while at the same time preparing them for a  job. A possible solution to these challenges would be to better integrate the industry with  educational institutions.  The Europe Policy Committee of the Association for Computing Machinery (Gagliardi, Hankin,  Gal-Ezer, McGettrick, & Meitern, 2016) indicates that students should be taught computing  before entering university, and cybersecurity concerns should be included. To do that, savvy  teachers are essential and should be expected to have a formal education as well as being well  trained on the subject. Cybersecurity should be incorporated in higher education computing  curricula to make sure graduates enter the workforce knowing the ethical implications of their  work and how to develop secure systems, while acknowledging that cybersecurity is a  comprehensive system issue. On a similar note, (Krutz & Richards, 2017) suggest that only 1  out of the 36 best computer science degrees in the United States requires a course in  cybersecurity. Students who show a basic understanding of cybersecurity usually have a  competitive advantage over other candidates when they apply for jobs. Therefore, it is time for  universities to start teaching more cybersecurity (8).  (Conklin, Cline, & Roosa, 2014) posit that one of the biggest concerns in cybersecurity  education is students’ lack of hands-on experience, resulting in a skills mismatch between what  the industry would like to see in a candidate and the skills that they actually possess. The  central theme of this concern is training versus education. Education tends to focus on the  7 This section reviews the major issues in cybersecurity education found in the literature. Although this might not always  portray current cybersecurity education issues within the EU, most of these problems seem to be generalisable to a few EU  national education and training systems.  8 Similar and complementary views are expressed by (Siraj, Taylor, Kaza, & Ghafoor, 2015), who also champion better  integration of security in computer science curricula, although they realise the education system faces big challenges such  as lack of faculty able to teach security, and a scarcity of teaching resources or spare rooms in computer science degrees.  A complementary perspective is given by Rowe et al. (Rowe, Lunt, & Ekstrom, 2011). They argue that computer science  provides an excellent basis to build an advanced cybersecurity curriculum, but currently there are various aspects that are  not covered by IT programmes, which should: (a) include a pervasive up-to-date security component in their curriculum  structures; (b) familiarise students with cybersecurity terminology; (c) teach students in a cybersecurity context; and (d)  introduce an advanced focus on the prepare, defend and act principles.  Mission-specific  and purpose-driven  cyber security  degrees would  greatly improve the  success of students  moving into the  workforce.  (Henry, 2017)  The IT industry  continues to evolve  at a rapid pace, and  despite the obvious  advancements in IT  education, most  graduates are not  ready to help  companies in  ramping up security  immediately.  (Kaspersky Lab,  2016)  CYBERSECURITY SKILLS DEVELOPMENT IN THE EU  December 2019  13  reasons, the theory and the mechanisms behind the material (9). The industry would like  workers who are ready to work from day 1. However, technology changes fast and the students  need to learn transferable skills that can be used throughout a lifelong career. Therefore, the  authors suggest that cybersecurity degree providers should balance the employability of the  students with providing the foundations for future professionals to update their skills in such a  dynamic environment.  (Vishik & Heisel, 2015) provide one of the few portraits of cybersecurity education in the EU. In  their research, they found cybersecurity education to be growing, but unevenly across Europe.  This is why many gaps still remain. According to them, different conceptualisations of the  science of cybersecurity have led to a variety of educational offerings, creating obstacles to the  creation of a common cybersecurity educational framework. They argue that there are  constraints on those students who wish to acquire an all-round skill set in cybersecurity, as  graduates have to specialise in either technical or societal cybersecurity issues, but not both.  Another challenge is the responsiveness of cybersecurity curricula to the evolution of the field.  So far, cybersecurity curricula have struggled to keep up, mainly because they lack  mechanisms to quickly incorporate material on emerging threats or new skills (10).  To sum up, this review found that there are several issues affecting cybersecurity education,  which include the lack of cybersecurity educators, poor interaction with the industry, little  understanding of the labour market, outdated or unrealistic platforms in education environments  and difficulties in keeping pace with the outside world.  Many other issues revolve around the idea of redefining educational and training pathways to  give a more unified standard for the knowledge and skills that students should acquire when  they enrol in a cybersecurity degree. When stakeholders stress the need to teach more  cybersecurity in computer science degrees, underline the poor alignment between education  and labour market demands, propose more multidisciplinary expertise and encourage educators  to promote more hands-on education, they are suggesting rethinking cybersecurity curricula and  educational experiences, taking all these factors into account.  Redefining curricula and educational paths is one of the major challenges regarding the  cybersecurity skill shortage. In fact, major stakeholders in the debate do not necessarily agree  on what the right cybersecurity knowledge and skills really are and we now witness a situation  where employers keep complaining that it is hard for them to identify and recruit graduates with  the right cybersecurity skills and knowledge when they hire for entry-level positions (ISACA,  2019).  There is a case for establishing a baseline in cybersecurity education and agreeing on the  knowledge and skills that degree courses should teach. One way to address this challenge is  for the relevant stakeholders — namely academia, governments and employers — to sit around  a table and discuss the basic knowledge and skills that students should develop when they  undertake a computing degree with a focus on cybersecurity. Because of their central role in  providing overarching educational frameworks, governments are more likely to take the lead in  setting up this partnership to improve the quality of cybersecurity education, and ENISA could  assist in the process of coordination among the EU initiatives.  9 Teaching a student to develop and implement specific firewall rules on a router is training. Teaching a student about  firewall rules, how they are used to implement a perimeter defence, and their strengths and weaknesses is the role of  education.  10 In sum, education and training are facing difficulties in matching the dynamic requirements of the workplace, even though  a number of EU Member States are making efforts to better link universities with the industry. This disconnection apparently  occurs because programmes are limited and do not have enough funding. To deal with these issues, Vishik and Heisel  formulate the following recommendations: (a) a multidisciplinary focus; (b) responsiveness to changes in technology and  societal environments; (c) end-to-end skill development; (d) alignment of curricula and training with demand for skills; (e)  using appropriate methodologies for teaching cybersecurity at all levels, from awareness to specialised expertise; and (f)  bringing all Member States to agree upon a baseline of cybersecurity education and skills indicators.  Academia,  governments  and employers  need to discuss  the cybersecurity  knowledge and  skills that  students should  develop during a  computing  degree course.  ENISA could  assist in the  process of  coordination  among the EU  cybersecurity  educational  initiatives.  CYBERSECURITY SKILLS DEVELOPMENT IN THE EU  December 2019  14  The next session describes how Australia, France, the United Kingdom and the United States  have set up certification schemes for cybersecurity degrees.  CYBERSECURITY SKILLS DEVELOPMENT IN THE EU  December 2019  15  4. THE CERTIFICATION OF  CYBERSECURITY DEGREES  This section describes the main criteria and processes through which four states — Australia,  France, the United Kingdom and the United States — have established certification schemes for  their national cybersecurity degrees. There are currently 387 degrees that are certified by  national authorities of these four states (11). These states established certification for  cybersecurity degrees mainly for the following reasons:   to have more graduates with skills readily deployable by the industry;   to help employers understand skills and knowledge that students have developed in their  academic careers;   to assist students in making more informed decisions about their degree choices.  When national authorities award certification, they attest that a degree meets the standards and  criteria that a group of experts considers necessary for a degree focusing on cybersecurity.  These certifications are overseen by states’ main cybersecurity national institutions, namely the  Agence Nationale de la Sécurité des Systèmes d’Information (ANSSI) in France, the  Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the National Security Agency (NSA) in the United  States, and the National Cyber Security Center (NCSC) in the United Kingdom, with the  exception of Australia, where the process is supervised by the Department of Education.  The expected ultimate impact of the certification of cybersecurity degrees is to reduce the CSSS  and mitigate national vulnerabilities through the promotion of cybersecurity education, research  and awareness.  4.1 AUSTRALIA  In Australia, two academic centres of cybersecurity excellence (ACCSEs) were established at  the University of Melbourne and Edith Cowan University in 2017. As part of the Australian  cybersecurity strategy, the establishment of the two ACCSEs directly supports one of the key  themes (building ‘A cyber smart nation’) of the country’s strategic vision and follows an  investment of AUD 1.9 million over 4 years by the government (Australian Government -  Department of Education, Academic Centres of Cyber Security Excellence (ACCSE), 2019).  This initiative is also aligned with the Cyber Security Science and Research Priorities, which aim  to enhance Australian leadership in innovative cybersecurity research and innovation. The  applications to become ACCSEs were assessed by a working group appointed by the Minister  for Education and Training (Australian Government - Department of Education, Academic  Centres of Cyber Security Excellence Program Guidelines, 2017).  11 These four were chosen because, to the best of our knowledge, they are the only ones that have established a rigorous  certification process for cybersecurity degrees. To ensure relevant cases were included, ENISA sent a request to EU  Member States in order to verify the existence of cybersecurity degree certifications. Although the Netherlands has  established some criteria to create a national map of cybersecurity degrees (https://www.dcypher.nl/en/map-dutch- cybersecurity-higher-education), only France and the United Kingdom have a formalised process about which information is  publicly available. For countries outside the EU, we checked national cybersecurity strategies and other policy documents  to verify whether or not other countries with a strong digital and cybersecurity posture (as defined by De Zan, 2019, pp. 78- 79) have degree certifications, but no other case studies were found.  https://www.dcypher.nl/en/map-dutch-cybersecurity-higher-education https://www.dcypher.nl/en/map-dutch-cybersecurity-higher-education  CYBERSECURITY SKILLS DEVELOPMENT IN THE EU  December 2019  16  Overall, ACCSEs (Australian Government - Department of Education, Academic Centres of Cyber  Security Excellence (ACCSE), 2019) target the national skills shortage of both technical and non-  technical cybersecurity expertise, and their intended impact is to:   encourage more students to study cybersecurity as an academic discipline;   increase the number of cybersecurity graduates with skills ready to be deployed in Australia’s  industry;   support cybersecurity research addressing key cybersecurity issues.  The Australian government also set short- and long-term outcomes that should be achieved with  this policy. Among the short-term results, ACCSEs are expected to:   advance collaboration with other universities, businesses and the government;   increase interest in their own programmes and activities;   have more internships supported by the private sector.  In the long term, the government expects ACCSEs to:   increase the number of skilled cybersecurity graduates entering the workforce and improve  the basic cybersecurity knowledge of non-cybersecurity graduates;   promote the provision of professional executive training;   increase the number of cybersecurity professionals coming from under-represented segments  of society;   conduct research projects that contribute to the cybersecurity strategy and the Science and  Research Priorities and to increase commercialisation outputs.  To become an ACCSE, a university must propose an integrated strategy to deliver degree,  research and professional programmes that will meet certain outcomes (Australian Government  - Department of Education, Academic Centres of Cyber Security Excellence Program Guidelines,  2017). In particular:   degree programmes should:  o be coherent and provide specific cybersecurity skills;  o have opportunities for workplace training and business mentoring;  o favour exchanges between the stakeholders within the cyber ecosystem;  o maintain sustained enrolment, strong graduation rates and employment outcomes;  o make cybersecurity courses available to students with no IT background;  o develop a plan to make cybersecurity more inclusive for women and indigenous  populations;   research programmes should:  o be in fields included in Excellence in Research for Australia;  o deliver high-calibre research outputs under the framework of the Science and  Research Priorities;  o have a strategy for engagement with stakeholders that make use of research  outputs;  o have a track record of commercialised research;   professional programmes should:  o be designed for both a technical and a non-technical audience;  o produce IT generalists in cybersecurity as well as more specific profiles that the  labour market needs.  CYBERSECURITY SKILLS DEVELOPMENT IN THE EU  December 2019  17  4.2 FRANCE  In France, ANSSI is responsible for the SecNumedu labelling programme, whose aim is to  inform students and employers that a degree meets the criteria of cybersecurity teaching and  training as defined by ANSSI. SecNumedu is based on criteria developed by ANSSI in  partnership with the industry, academia, professional associations and the Ministry of  Education.  Certification lasts for 3 years and allows degrees to be displayed on ANSSI’s website (12).  As a prerequisite for the application, degrees can be labelled if they meet one of the following  criteria.   The university course awards a bachelor’s (licence) or master’s degree.   An engineering degree (13) is recognised by the French Commission des Titres d’Ingénieurs.   The mastère spécialisé is recognised by the French Conférence des Grandes Ecoles.   Level I and II professional certifications are included in the Répertoire national des  certifications professionnelles (RNCP).  In order to be certified, a cybersecurity programme has to sign a convention and make an  application to ANSSI, which has 2 months to assess it (14). Within ANSSI, the Centre de  formation à la sécurité des systèmes d’information (CFSSI) is the body in charge of evaluating  the application.  By signing the convention, the educational/training organisation commits to following the  professional paths of alumni for 5 years after graduation, to provide updated information on the  degree each year and to accept monitoring and verification by ANSSI (15).  In the application, training organisations should highlight key elements such as the following (16).   Dominant content of the training. Training is considered predominantly technical when  more than 50 % of the course is dedicated to practical technical activities (17); it is regarded as  predominantly organisational when the practical technical activities account for less than  50 % of the course (18).   Level of competence in security. The training organisation should indicate the levels of  proficiency in security knowledge and skills at which students are supposed to start and  conclude the academic programme (19); higher proficiency levels require practical activities to  be included in the programme, such as laboratory work.   Distribution of teaching practices. The practical elements of the training must be at least  50 % of the course.   Course volume and work dedicated to security. To be eligible for the label, taught courses  and practical activities in cybersecurity should cover 70 % of the total or more than 400 hours.   Legal aspects. Personal data protection and other legal topics must be included in the  training programme.  12 https://www.ssi.gouv.fr/en/cybersecurity-in-france/formations/secnumedu-labeling-of-higher-education-courses-in- cybersecurity  13 Note that in France an engineering degree is basically a master’s degree in a technology field, whereas the mastère  spécialisé is a 1-year post-master’s specialisation programme.  14 See https://www.ssi.gouv.fr/particulier/formations/secnumedu/f-a-q-secnumedu/.  15 See https://www.ssi.gouv.fr/uploads/2017/11/anssi-secnumedu-charte_v2-2016-07-22_en.pdf.  16 The following list of criteria is non-exhaustive. For the full list, please refer to  https://www.ssi.gouv.fr/uploads/2017/11/anssi-secnumedu-f-02_v2.0_dossier_en.pdf  17These might include, for example, software development, reverse engineering, cryptography and secure development.  18Organisational courses typically include methodological work, risk analysis and organisational audits, definition of security  policies, etc.  19 The levels are: no skills, awareness, application, mastery and specialised. An organisation cannot claim graduates’ level  of competence to be application, mastery or specialised without practical activities in their programmes.  https://www.ssi.gouv.fr/en/cybersecurity-in-france/formations/secnumedu-labeling-of-higher-education-courses-in-cybersecurity https://www.ssi.gouv.fr/en/cybersecurity-in-france/formations/secnumedu-labeling-of-higher-education-courses-in-cybersecurity https://www.ssi.gouv.fr/particulier/formations/secnumedu/f-a-q-secnumedu/ https://www.ssi.gouv.fr/uploads/2017/11/anssi-secnumedu-charte_v2-2016-07-22_en.pdf https://www.ssi.gouv.fr/uploads/2017/11/anssi-secnumedu-f-02_v2.0_dossier_en.pdf  CYBERSECURITY SKILLS DEVELOPMENT IN THE EU  December 2019  18   Alumni professional paths follow-up. The organisation should keep track of the types of  jobs that alumni obtain in the first 5 years after graduation.   Teaching faculty. The application should give the profiles of the teaching faculty, including  the ratio of faculty with a pure academic background to faculty with an industry background.   Professional certification. The training organisation should state whether the degree  includes courses dedicated to preparing students for a professional certificate or certification  is obtained by the students during the programme.  At the time of writing, there are 59 degree programmes that can boast the SecNumedu label:   13 masters’,   7 mastères spécialisés,   17 ingénieurs (including one ingénieur de spécialisation),   3 RNCP Level I   19 Licence pro  4.3 UNITED KINGDOM  In the United Kingdom, the National Cyber Security Centre (NSCS) certifies bachelors’,  integrated masters’ and masters’ degrees, and apprenticeships. This initiative directly stems  from the UK Cyber Security Strategy 2016-21, which states that ‘the UK requires more talented  and qualified cybersecurity professionals’20. According to the NCSC (NCSC, 2019), certification  should help:   universities to attract highly talented students;   employers to understand skills and knowledge that students possess;   students to make more informed decisions on the value of their degrees.  To be in scope, degrees should have a minimum amount of credits in computer science or  cybersecurity, depending on whether they are bachelors’ or masters’ degrees. For example, a  bachelor’s degree in computer science and cybersecurity should have a minimum of 160 credits  in taught computer science courses (21) and at least 90 credits in cybersecurity topics (22);  masters’ degrees in general cybersecurity should have 70 % of their taught modules on  cybersecurity; masters’ degrees in digital forensics should have 70 % of their taught modules on  digital forensics subject areas.  The NCSC provides either a provisional or a full certification, which is valid for 5 years (23).  Universities that apply for certification need to submit an application detailing:   the teaching faculty,   the taught cybersecurity courses,   the types of examinations used to assess students,   how students do their dissertations,   how many students enrol and their grades,   students’ feedback on the course.  20https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/567242/national_cyber _security_strategy_2016.pdf  21 The computer science subject areas come from the computer science curricula 2013 developed by the Association for  Computing Machinery and the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers.  22 Numbers of cybersecurity credits vary according to Pathways. The cybersecurity topics (i.e. ‘Security Discipline Principles  and Skills Groups’) stem from the IISP Information Security Skills Framework.  23 See https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/information/ncsc-degree-certification-call-new-applicants-0.  https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/567242/national_cyber_security_strategy_2016.pdf https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/567242/national_cyber_security_strategy_2016.pdf https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/information/ncsc-degree-certification-call-new-applicants-0  CYBERSECURITY SKILLS DEVELOPMENT IN THE EU  December 2019  19  Applications from universities are examined by a panel with members from the NCSC, other  government departments, industry, professional bodies and academia. Each of the components  of the application is marked 0 to 4 depending on the level of evidence provided. The average for  all sections must be at least 3, which means that the evidence provided is of a good  standard (24).  At the time of writing, in the United Kingdom there are 33 certified degrees with either  provisional or full certification (NCSC, 2019):   4 certified bachelors’ degrees (1 full certification; 3 provisional certifications),   3 provisionally certified integrated masters’ degrees,   26 certified masters’ degrees (16 full certifications; 10 provisional certifications).  In 2013, the centres for doctoral training (CDTs) in cybersecurity were established as a part of  the 2011 national cybersecurity programme. A CDT in cybersecurity provides a 4-year  programme: enrolled doctoral students attend a taught component in their first year and  undertake a specific research project with a clear focus on cybersecurity in the remaining 3  years. The taught component should account for 25 % of the doctoral programme, enhance  students’ technical knowledge across all areas of cybersecurity, be relevant to business  demands, expose students to activities other than research (for example public engagement).  The subsequent research element should directly draw from the taught component, reflect the  expertise of the teaching staff, contribute to a multidisciplinary understanding of cybersecurity  and possibly have an impact beyond academia (EPSRC, 2012).  Universities applying to become CDTs in cybersecurity need to produce evidence of the  following.   Scope of the proposed CDT. The university should indicate the main cybersecurity domain it  wishes to focus on while emphasising the multidisciplinary scope of the programme.   Strategy and alignment. It should provide an explanation of the CDT’s strategy and how this  aligns with the United Kingdom’s cybersecurity needs; it should detail how the admission  process of students will take place and what kind of profiles suit the CDT’s strategy.   International standing. It should provide evidence of success in the delivery of masters’ or  doctoral courses and production of scientific research.   Taught course component. It should describe the curriculum of the courses provided and  provision of external training, highlight past successes in the delivery of similar courses and  have a plan to teach non-technical/transferable skills.   Research component. It should describe the process for generating dissertations and  potential supervisory arrangements.   Engagement with industry and users. A plan for engagement with the industry should be  set out, including dissemination and outreach strategies.   Management. The application should describe the management structure, including a list of  key academic staff and a nomination for director.  4.4 UNITED STATES  In the United States, the NSA sponsors centres of academic excellence (CAEs) in  cybersecurity. There are two types of CAE: cyberdefence and cyber operations.  The DHS and the NSA jointly sponsor the CAE in cyberdefence (CAE-CD) programme, which  started in 1999 (NSA-CSS, 2019).  24 See https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/files/Certification-Degree-Apprenticeships-Issue-1_0-Feb-2019.pdf.  https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/files/Certification-Degree-Apprenticeships-Issue-1_0-Feb-2019.pdf  CYBERSECURITY SKILLS DEVELOPMENT IN THE EU  December 2019  20  The declared scope of the programme is the reduction of national vulnerabilities through the  promotion of cybersecurity higher education and research. There are currently 272 institutions  in the United States that are recognised as CAEs-CD. Regionally accredited 2-year, 4-year and  graduate-level institutions in the United States could become CAEs. These institutions are  formally recognised by the US government, but they do not receive direct funding from it. They  can apply for two different designations:   CAE in CD education (CAE-CDE) for associate, bachelors’, masters’ and doctoral  programmes,   CAE in CD research.  Depending on the level of the programme, organisations must meet different criteria. For  example, for a CAE-CDE bachelor’s, master’s, doctoral designation an organisation should  submit documentation covering the following (NSA-DHS, 2019):   support from the management of the institution;   delivery of a cyberdefence curriculum over the previous 3 years (25);   student skills development and assessment, detailing the courses required for the  development of scholarly skills, courses requiring laboratory exercises/hands-on assignments,  students’ participations in cybersecurity competitions and how the programme facilitates  interactions with cybersecurity practitioners;   the entity’s status as the main centre for cybersecurity education and practice, whose purpose  is to give guidance on CD information and be the focal point for collaboration and outreach  activities;   profile of cybersecurity faculty, with biographies and curricula vitae including academic  presentations, publications and support to students’ activities such as clubs and competitions;   how cybersecurity is taught in a multidisciplinary manner and how it is integrated into other  degree programmes within the academic institution;   if the institution has a security policy for the protection of its information systems;   how outreach and collaboration activities go beyond the institution and branch out to other  education institutions, the CAE community and industry.  Applications are reviewed by qualified cybersecurity professionals and subject matter experts  from CAE institutions, the government and the industry. If successful, an institution keeps the  designation for 5 years (NSA-CSS, 2019).  The CAE in cyber operations (CAE-CO) programme is complementary to the CAE-CD, with the  aim of supporting the National Initiative for Cybersecurity Education (NICE) and increasing the  pipeline of cybersecurity professionals. This programme has a strong foundation in computer  science, computer engineering and electrical engineering, and is particularly devoted to the  study of technologies and tools enabling cyber operations such as collection, exploitation and  response (NSA-CSS, 2019). At the time of writing, there are 21 CAE-CO designated institutions,  13 providing bachelors’ courses and 8 providing masters’ courses (26).  Institutions can apply for either the fundamental or the advanced programme. Requisites for the  fundamental programme include the following (27).   Academic content. The programme must include 100 % of the mandatory academic content  of the cybersecurity knowledge unit and 10 out of the 17 optional content units.  25 The curriculum must have courses mapped onto the list of foundational, core and optional cybersecurity knowledge units.  26 See https://www.nsa.gov/resources/students-educators/centers-academic-excellence/cae-co-centers/.  27 See https://www.nsa.gov/resources/students-educators/centers-academic-excellence/cae-co-advanced/.  https://www.nsa.gov/resources/students-educators/centers-academic-excellence/cae-co-centers/ https://www.nsa.gov/resources/students-educators/centers-academic-excellence/cae-co-advanced/  CYBERSECURITY SKILLS DEVELOPMENT IN THE EU  December 2019  21   Cyber operations recognition. The specialisation in cyber operations must be recognised  through a certificate.   Curricula review. A CAE-CO fundamental programme must have a strong foundation in  computer science, computer engineering or electrical engineering.   Cyber operations as an interdisciplinary science. The curriculum must expose students to  the policy, social, legal and ethical aspects of cyber operations and may include courses from  multiple colleges within a university as well as from multiple programmes and disciplines.   Robust and active cyber operations academic programme. The programme must provide  data on when cybersecurity operation courses were last taught.   Faculty and student involvement. Faculty and students should be involved in cyber  operations research.   Learning activities. Students ought to participate in clubs, cyber exercises and other  outreach activities to expand the cyber operations community.   Commitment to support the programme. There is commitment to support the CAE-CO  programme through the CAE-CO summer internship programme, and faculty participates in  knowledge exchange programmes.  4.5 CYBERSECURITY DEGREE CERTIFICATIONS: SUMMARY OF MAIN  FEATURES  Australia, France, the United Kingdom and the United States have set up schemes to certify  that national computer science degrees with a focus on cybersecurity, and cybersecurity  degrees, meet standards that their cybersecurity organisations have established. Although  processes and criteria differ, they also have several commonalities.  Not surprisingly, certification is awarded to degrees that provide an adequate amount of  taught courses and activities that are specific to cybersecurity. This is done to differentiate  courses that are in cybersecurity (or computer science degrees with a clear focus on  cybersecurity) from IT courses that could claim to provide some sort of cybersecurity education  but not enough to form well-rounded cybersecurity graduates.  Certification is typically awarded to those institutions that can show in great detail how  cybersecurity education is provided. For example, national authorities often inquire about the  structure of the curriculum and if more practical training is included. Moreover, a number of  certification processes ask directly about the kind of examinations students undergo, including  for example how students do their dissertations, what courses take place to increase students’  academic skills, how much time students spend on hands-on activities and if students are  encouraged to attend cybersecurity competitions. Finally, academic institutions often have to  declare whether or not the degree prepares students for a professional organisation.  A lot of importance is placed on the quality of the faculty, meaning that national authorities  request biographies and curricula vitae of lecturers. Academic institutions are often asked to  clarify the nature of the cybersecurity research that faculty is engaged in and if at least part of  the faculty has an industry background.  Degrees that have a broader interdisciplinary focus have more chance of being certified. For  example, topics that are not solely technical are strongly encouraged, such as legal courses on  data protection. Sometimes, even degrees that are not purely technical but have a predominant  organisational component can receive certification, although generally speaking the emphasis is  on teaching foundational engineering and computer science knowledge. In sum, cybersecurity  should be taught in a multidisciplinary manner and students should be exposed to a variety of  aspects of cybersecurity: policy, social, legal and ethical.  CYBERSECURITY SKILLS DEVELOPMENT IN THE EU  December 2019  22  National authorities place importance on external outreach activities and collaboration  opportunities that degrees have in place. From various education-to-labour market initiatives,  such as workplace training, business mentoring or internships and traineeships, to more  academic forms of collaborations with similar institutions, states seem to sponsor those degrees  that enhance and enrich a vigorous national cybersecurity ecosystem.  Finally, governments are interested in knowing about academic and employment outcomes.  Most notably, they seek to know how many students enrol each year, how many graduates a  course produces and possibly the types of jobs alumni end up securing after obtaining the degree.  CYBERSECURITY SKILLS DEVELOPMENT IN THE EU  December 2019  23  5. THE EU DIGITAL AND  CYBERSECURITY  EDUCATION POLICY &  ENISA’S HIGHER EDUCATION  DATABASE  This section details the activities that the European Commission and ENISA have put in place to  develop digital and cybersecurity education within the EU. In doing so, this section  contextualises ENISA’s work programme (ENISA, 2019) for supporting the EU Member States  in cybersecurity skill development (Output O.3.3.3) within a broader institutional and policy  framework. It also describes how the information collected in Sections 2 and 3 has been used to  inform the establishment of ENISA’s Cybersecurity Higher Education Database.  5.1 THE EU DIGITAL AND CYBERSECURITY EDUCATION POLICY  Interest in cybersecurity education and skills is of long standing within the EU and it has been a  policy concern since the publication by the European Commission of the first EU cybersecurity  strategy in 2013 (European Commission, High Representative of the European for Foreign  Affairs, & Policy, Cybersecurity Strategy of the European Union: An Open, Safe and Secure  Cyberspace, 2013). In the strategy document, the Commission invited Member States to  increase their education and training efforts around network and information security (NIS)  topics and to plan a ‘NIS driving licence’ as a voluntary certification programme to promote  enhanced skills and competence of IT professionals.  In the assessment of the EU 2013 cybersecurity strategy (28), the Commission reiterated that  ‘Awareness raising and skills development remain relevant Strategy objectives, for which  continuous efforts at both national and EU level are needed’.  This was considered urgent  especially in the light of the results of a public consultation, which listed skills development,  education and training of cybersecurity professionals among the top 5 challenges (in a list of 16)  for the future of EU cybersecurity.  In 2017, in the Joint Communication ‘Resilience, deterrence and defence: Building strong  cybersecurity for the EU’ (European Commission, High Representative of the European for  Foreign Affairs, & Policy, Resilience, Deterrence and Defence: Building strong cybersecurity for  the EU, 2017), the European Commission and the High Representative of the Union for Foreign  Affairs and Security Policy confirmed again that ‘there is a strong education dimension to  cybersecurity’ and that ‘effective cybersecurity relies heavily on the skills of the people  concerned’. They recommended that together with Member States, the EU should make a  contribution to enhance cybersecurity education and skills by building on the work of the Digital  Skills and Jobs Coalition, for example through the establishment of cybersecurity  apprenticeships for small and medium-sized enterprises, while action should be taken to  streamline cybersecurity into skills programmes, e-government and awareness campaigns.  The Joint Communication also called for the establishment of a European cybersecurity  industrial, technology and research competence centre and a network of national cybersecurity  28 See https://ec.europa.eu/transparency/regdoc/rep/other/SWD-2017-295-F1-EN-0-0.PDF (p. 34).  https://ec.europa.eu/transparency/regdoc/rep/other/SWD-2017-295-F1-EN-0-0.PDF  CYBERSECURITY SKILLS DEVELOPMENT IN THE EU  December 2019  24  coordination centres. The identifiied objective would be to help the EU retain and develop the  cybersecurity technological and industrial capabilities that are necessary to secure the digital  single market. According to the proposal, this initiative should provide input to policymakers  involved in increasing cybersecurity skills and help develop a qualified EU cybersecurity  workforce (European Commission, Proposal for a European Cybersecurity Competence  Network and Centre | Digital Single Market, 2019). In 2019, four pilot projects (29) —  CONCORDIA, ECHO, SPARTA and CyberSec4Europe — were launched to establish and  operate a pilot for a European cybersecurity competence network and to develop a common  European cybersecurity research and innovation roadmap. Among other goals, the four projects  will implement activities to increase training courses or programmes to tackle the CSSS in the  EU.  These activities have been complemented by the Digital Education Action Plan, which includes  ‘Cybersecurity in Education — Raising awareness of teachers and students’ (30) among the 11  actions to support the use of technology and the development of digital competences in  education. The Action Plan’s main tasks include an EU awareness campaign on cyberculture,  promoting basic cybersecurity practices among children, parents and educators, and a course  for educators to equip them with the pedagogical tools for teaching cybersecurity in primary and  secondary schools.  5.2 ENISA ROLE IN CYBERSECURITY EDUCATION  In this context, ENISA has been an active player in cybersecurity education, awareness and  research. Since 2012, the Agency has produced seven publications that are highly relevant to  the topic, ranging from broader NIS education roadmaps and public–private partnerships to  workforce development and the status of privacy and NIS curricula (31).  ENISA also helps organise the European Cyber Security Challenge (ECSC) (32). The ECSC is a  cybersecurity competition aimed at increasing talent across Europe and connecting highly  skilled individuals with leading industry organisations. The ECSC started in 2014, when three  national teams competed against each other in Fürstenfeld (Austria) on challenges with such  names as APT Network, Forensic Challenge, Java Hash Collisions, SQL Injections and Licence  Key Circumventions. After the first edition in 2014, more editions took place. The most recent  one took place in Bucharest in 2019 (33), where 20 teams and approximately 200 participants  from all over Europe tried to win cybersecurity challenges based on a curriculum developed by  experts from academia, industry and ENISA.  ENISA and the European Commission have also been running the European Cyber Security  Month (ECSM) (34) since 2012. The ECSM is an EU-wide awareness campaign fostering  cybersecurity knowledge among citizens by promoting education, sharing of good practices and  competitions in data and information security. The campaign targets both the general public but  also more specific groups such as IT experts, NIS authorities and academic organisations. The  2018 edition (35) registered new highs compared with the previous ones in terms of number of  activities (+ 6.5 %, from 532 to 567), social media followers (+ 28 %, from 12 894 to 16 500),  29 See https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/four-eu-pilot-projects-launched-prepare-european-cybersecurity- competence-network.  30 See https://ec.europa.eu/education/education-in-the-eu/european-education-area/digital-education-action-plan-action-7- cybersecurity-in-education_en.  31 These publications, which can be found at https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/cybersecurity-education?tab=publications,  are Network information security in education (2012), Collaborative solutions for network information security in education  (2012), Brokerage model for network and information security in education (2014), Public private partnerships in network  and information security education (2014), Roadmap for NIS education programmes in Europe (2014), Cybersecurity  education snapshot for workforce development in the EU (2015) and Status of privacy and NIS course curricula in EU  Member States (2015).  32 https://www.europeancybersecuritychallenge.eu/.  33 https://europeancybersecuritychallenge.eu/past-editions.  34 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/cybersecurity-education/european-cyber-security-month.  35 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/ecsm-2018-deployment-report/at_download/fullReport.  https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/four-eu-pilot-projects-launched-prepare-european-cybersecurity-competence-network https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/four-eu-pilot-projects-launched-prepare-european-cybersecurity-competence-network https://ec.europa.eu/education/education-in-the-eu/european-education-area/digital-education-action-plan-action-7-cybersecurity-in-education_en https://ec.europa.eu/education/education-in-the-eu/european-education-area/digital-education-action-plan-action-7-cybersecurity-in-education_en https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/cybersecurity-education?tab=publications https://www.europeancybersecuritychallenge.eu/ https://europeancybersecuritychallenge.eu/past-editions https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/cybersecurity-education/european-cyber-security-month https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/ecsm-2018-deployment-report/at_download/fullReport  CYBERSECURITY SKILLS DEVELOPMENT IN THE EU  December 2019  25  online reach (+ 4.6 %, from 86.5 million to 90.5 million) and publications mentioning the ECSM  (+ 400 %, from 330 to 1 655).  5.3 ENISA CYBERSECURITY HIGHER EDUCATION DATABASE  In this rather broad context, the present study tackles the policy challenge of the CSSS  (Section 2); considers what relevant stakeholders and experts have said about current  challenges in cybersecurity education and skills issues (Section 3); incorporates evidence from  national certification processes in Australia, France, the United Kingdom and the United States  (Section 4); and complements other activities in cybersecurity education and skills within the EU  (Section 5). In particular, this study aims to:  Promote a series of new activities in the area of cyber security skill development which will focus  on identifying current national and EU wide initiatives. The main output of this activity will be a  database of existing services and programs in the EU that aim to enhance cyber security skills  among EU citizens, in general, and cyber security experts, in particular. (ENISA, 2019)  To accomplish this task, ENISA is in the process of establishing the Cybersecurity Higher  Education Database. The Database is an updated version of the older Cybersecurity Education  Map, the two main novelties being a new user interface (an updated online map) and more  information on the cybersecurity degrees listed.  The Database aims to become the main point of reference for all citizens looking to upskill their  cybersecurity knowledge and skills. In essence, it is a list of cybersecurity degrees in EEA  countries and Switzerland. The database has basic filters that give essential information about  cybersecurity degrees, but also more advanced information that should allow citizens to make  more informed decisions about cybersecurity degrees (36).  Higher education institutions can add a degree in the Database if the degree is recognised by a  national authority of an EU or EFTA Member State and:   for a bachelor’s degree, at least 25 % of taught courses are on cybersecurity topics;   for a master’s degree, at least 40 % of taught courses are on cybersecurity topics;   for a PhD degree, students conduct research on a cybersecurity topic.  The term ‘cybersecurity topic’ refers to the topics in the knowledge areas of the Cybersecurity  Curricula 2017 developed by the Joint Task Force on Cybersecurity Education (Joint Task  Force on Cybersecurity Education, 2017). These knowledge areas are:   data security,   software security,   component security,   connection security,   system security,   human security,   organisational security,   societal security (37).  36 We recognise that professional certificates in a specific cybersecurity topic or field might be used as a solution to provide  specialised personnel able to respond to the immediate needs of the labour market. Hence, short-term solutions that  include collaboration between industry, professional certification bodies and academia might able to reduce limited  shortages of specific cybersecurity professionals. The Cybersecurity Higher Education Map does not at the moment include  professional certificates, but future iterations of the database might.  37 For a more detailed list of topics, please refer to Chapter 4 of Cybersecurity curricula 2017: Curriculum Guidelines for  Post-Secondary Degree Programs in Cybersecurity (https://www.acm.org/binaries/content/assets/education/curricula- recommendations/csec2017.pdf).  https://www.acm.org/binaries/content/assets/education/curricula-recommendations/csec2017.pdf https://www.acm.org/binaries/content/assets/education/curricula-recommendations/csec2017.pdf  CYBERSECURITY SKILLS DEVELOPMENT IN THE EU  December 2019  26  Higher education institutions will be invited to add relevant cybersecurity degrees and will be  asked to provide evidence of the taught cybersecurity courses that the degree offers. If a  degree does not offer the minimum required number of cybersecurity courses, it will be not be  included in the database. This is done to make sure the Database is relevant to people looking  for cybersecurity-specific degrees.  One of the main features of the new Cybersecurity Higher Education Database is the updated  information that it will contain about cybersecurity degrees. When universities enter their  degrees, they will be asked to provide standard mandatory information, including:   institution/university name,   degree/programme name,   type of degree/programme (bachelor’s, master’s or PhD),   delivery (classroom, online, blended, etc.),   language of instruction,   country and city,   degree’s online homepage/URL  They will have to answer the following questions as well.   Does the degree provide a specialisation in a particular cybersecurity topic?   Is the degree certified by a national cybersecurity authority following a formal certification  process?  Besides this standard information, however, higher education institutions will be encouraged to  provide more data. This information will be optional and therefore institutions will decide  whether or not to provide it. This optional information is meant to assist citizens even more in  finding and choosing the cybersecurity degree that best suits their needs. This additional  information is based on the relevant factors that emerged from the analyses in Sections 3 and 4  of this document (38). The optional information that may be added answers the following  questions.   Does the degree prepare students to undertake any professional certification?   Does the degree include a compulsory internship as a part of the degree programme?   Are there modules/lectures/units taught by professionals/specialists currently employed in the  industry?   What is the cost of tuition fees for EU citizens?   How many credits are included in the degree?   How many credits are in security computing or engineering topics (39)?   How many credits are in social science topics (40)?   How many credits are in organisational and managerial topics (41)?   How many female students graduated last year?   When was the degree established?  (38 Although some of this optional information is derived from the criteria that countries use to certify cybersecurity degrees,  the Database is not meant as a certification/accreditation process. The main difference between an application for national  certification and an application for inclusion in ENISA’s Database is that applications for national certification are reviewed  by a committee of national experts who evaluate the degree in accordance with a set of criteria. In contrast, an application  to be added to the map is not based on a qualitative assessment of the application; rather, ENISA will ensure that the  content provided respects the basic requirement (minimum percentage of taught cybersecurity courses depending on the  level of the degree) of the Database and that the additional information provided is truthful.  39 For example system security, network security, component security, data security and software security.  40 For example law, ethics, policy, privacy and criminology.  41 For example business, risk management and compliance.  CYBERSECURITY SKILLS DEVELOPMENT IN THE EU  December 2019  27  6. SUMMARY AND  RECOMMENDATIONS  This report started with an analysis of one of the most discussed issues in cybersecurity: the  skills shortage. Section 2 provided information on the worldwide shortage, and later zeroed in  on the situation in the EU, where nevertheless granular data are lacking compared with, for  example, Australia, the United Kingdom and the United States. Although the CSSS is  compounded by several factors, this report outlines four seemingly principal reasons. The first  two relate to the way employers (either public or private) recruit and value cyber security  professionals. Employers tend to look for professionals with years of experience, certifications  and relevant degrees, but these people are hard to find in this highly constrained labour market.  Because of this scarcity, employers should be probably both increasing their salaries to attract  more people into the sector and provide adequate training, but they seldom do. On the other  hand, there are two reasons why the education and training system could be also hold  responsible for the current labour market gridlock: it is not incentivizing enough students to join  cyber security-relevant degrees and seems unable to equip them with the right cyber security  knowledge and skills, which could give them better chances to become cyber security  professionals one day.  Summarising the views of the main stakeholders, Section 3 argues that most of the problems  that are beleaguering cybersecurity education and training — few cybersecurity courses in  computing curricula, poor alignment between educational offers and labour market demands,  little emphasis on multidisciplinary knowledge, and prominence of theory-based education  rather than hands-on training — revolve around the need to redefine educational and training  pathways to give a more unified standard on the knowledge and skills that students should  develop.  One way to do this is to bring major stakeholders to sit around a table and clearly define what  cybersecurity students ought to know and be able to do upon graduation and before entering  the labour market. To accomplish this, four states — Australia, France, the United Kingdom and  the United States — have established certification procedures to confirm that cybersecurity  degrees comply with the quality standards that national groups of experts have agreed upon.  Certification processes and requirements vary among these four states, but six major elements  are recurrent.  A certified higher education cybersecurity degree should have:   enough specific credits dedicated to cybersecurity courses and activities;   a structured curriculum, possibly including a practical/training component or specific  types of examinations and activities such as cybersecurity competitions;   a high-quality teaching faculty, which might include lecturers from the industry;   a broader multi-/interdisciplinary focus;   outreach activities and collaborations with the rest of the national cybersecurity  ecosystem;   information on academic and employment outcomes.  CYBERSECURITY SKILLS DEVELOPMENT IN THE EU  December 2019  28  In this context, ENISA created the Cybersecurity Higher Education Database to list  cybersecurity higher education degrees in EEA countries and Switzerland. The aim of the  Database is to become the premier source of information for citizens looking to upscale their  cybersecurity knowledge and skills by enrolling in a higher education degree course. The  Database is meant to help citizens navigate the growing cybersecurity educational offer and  help them make more informed decisions about the type of degree that is most suitable. The  information that institutions will provide to populate the Database is based on similar criteria to  those that countries use to certify national cybersecurity degrees. By creating a single and easy-  to-use online platform where citizens can find relevant information on cybersecurity degrees,  ENISA seeks to close potential information gaps — which arise, for example, when students  might be interested in a cybersecurity career but have no information on the best educational  pathways available — and bring cybersecurity supply and demand closer together.  6.1 CONSIDERATIONS  This report puts forward three main considerations.  a) When academia, employers and governments come together to determine what educational  and training experiences would be appropriate for cybersecurity, they recognise the  importance of achieving conceptual clarity on what it means to equip students with the right  cybersecurity knowledge and skills.  Clarifying this will help mitigate one factor that compounds the CSSS. This is also useful  because it better defines who should do what in developing the skills and knowledge of the  national cybersecurity workforce. This is especially true because employers should  recognise that higher education institutions are not necessarily meant to provide graduates  with the specific skills for a particular job; rather, they are intended to give students the  knowledge, skills and methods that will equip them to constantly engage with an evolving  threat scenario. As pointed out by Malan et al. (2018), cybersecurity should be seen as a  very technical subject requiring many years of experience. Therefore, even students who  obtain degrees that are highly relevant will need to develop their knowledge and skills further  once they leave the educational system, which implies that they must be provided with the  right opportunities for training. As Professor Steve Furnell puts it:  I think that care needs to be taken about how much we regard graduates as being directly  ‘qualified to work’ in the IT security field. Even as degree graduates, I would not necessarily  regard them as qualified practitioners. They should certainly have a good level of supporting  knowledge and some of the skills, but there will equally be various aspects that they have  not been able to put into practice ‘for real’ at that stage.(42)  Taking this into account, certification of cybersecurity degrees might be an important turning  point in a comprehensive cybersecurity workforce development strategy. This is because it  could clarify what knowledge and skills the education system is supposed to instil and,  consequently, what sort of training and further learning opportunities employers should  provide when students enter the workforce. In other words, cybersecurity degree certification  clarifies what education systems are supposed to achieve when training students, but also  defines the point at which employers should take over in continuing to develop the  workforce.  This recognises the fact that each stakeholder has a role in the formation and development  of skills of the national cybersecurity workforce. Because of the potential impact of  certification, it would be important to rigorously assess the expected outcomes. For  example, in the United Kingdom (Malan, Lale-Demoz, & Rampton, 2018) revealed that,  42 See https://media.kaspersky.com/uk/Kaspersky-Cyberskills-Report_UK.pdf  https://media.kaspersky.com/uk/Kaspersky-Cyberskills-Report_UK.pdf  CYBERSECURITY SKILLS DEVELOPMENT IN THE EU  December 2019  29  when students consider whether or not to apply for a degree in cybersecurity, they value the  ties between the academic institution and the industry — in the form of NCSC certification —  as important. Future research should further determine the benefits of certification for  students and employers and whether or not it effectively provides a more skilled workforce  and helps mitigate the CSSS.  b) However, determining what the right skills are is only a portion of a much wider problem that  is worsened by several other factors. This report concentrated on only one of the main  causes attributed to the CSSS. Although cybersecurity degree certification could be a step in  the right direction, it cannot be considered the only solution. In fact, some countries have  articulated cybersecurity education and skills strategies in which policies such as  certification are only one of several instruments.  The CSSS is both a qualitative and a quantitative issue, meaning that it should be tackled  along these two dimensions. Increasing the quality of cybersecurity graduates through  certified degrees is certainly useful to make cybersecurity job candidates more employable,  but this is not sufficient if the pipeline of professionals is not ample enough to guarantee that  vacancies are filled. For example, a national education system might be able to produce 100  quality candidates a year, but if the states needs 1 000 a year the shortage will persist.  Therefore, if states decide to implement strategies to cope with the CSSS, they must  differentiate between policies to increase the quality of candidates and those to increase  their number. For example, in the United Kingdom, in the 2016-17 academic year 79 905  students in higher education studied computer science, while 5 827 were enrolled in  cybersecurity courses (Malan, Lale-Demoz, & Rampton, 2018). This means that only 7 % of  students studying IT-related courses had a particular focus on security. Future research  should investigate whether or not policies could be able to incentivise large swaths of  students to enter educational pathways that would help create a self-sustained cybersecurity  workforce.  c) Moreover, scholars studying the intersection of education with the labour market have long  warned about the need to go beyond initiatives that target only the supply side of the  equation. (Mayhew & Keep, 2014). Incorporating policies to tackle issues that arise on the  demand side of the labour market, including deployment and ‘skill utilisation’, might be  beneficial (Buchanan, Finegold, Mayhew, & Warhurst, 2017). For example, Keep (Keep,  2017) argues that:  the alternative is to branch out and to adopt policies that see education and training as a  component within a much broader set of policies concerned with economic development,  business improvement, workplace innovation, productivity growth, and job quality.  There is plentiful evidence suggesting that the CSSS is affected by problems that are  generated on the demand side of the equation as well, namely when employers ask for  several years of professional experience and professional certification or are unwilling to  invest in human capital by providing training opportunities. Because of that, it would be  particularly promising to find solutions easing the transition from the education system into  the labour market and giving an active and systematic role to employers in developing the  cybersecurity workforce.  This does not seem to be an easy task and it probably requires further understanding of  what happens to cybersecurity graduates once they leave education. When a shortage  occurs, one would expect most cybersecurity students to quickly fill cybersecurity vacancies  as soon as they graduate. There is evidence suggesting otherwise. For example, one third  CYBERSECURITY SKILLS DEVELOPMENT IN THE EU  December 2019  30  of cybersecurity graduates in the United Kingdom go into positions that are unrelated to  cybersecurity (Malan, Lale-Demoz, & Rampton, 2018).  In the context of a shortage with potential implications for national security and economic  development, further research should thoroughly investigate the causes of such leakage.  Furthermore, easing the transition from the education system to the labour market is an  effort that probably requires a stronger and mature partnership between academia,  employers and the government. In this context, there seems to be an opportunity to study  how, perhaps after the adoption of certified cybersecurity degrees, employers might pledge  to increase the number of junior/entry-level opportunities and thus disrupt the bottlenecks  that are currently worsening the shortage.  6.2 RECOMMENDATIONS  In the light of this discussion, this report recommends further investigation of the following.  The impact of the certification of cybersecurity degrees on the CSSS. A rigorous and  systematic analysis of the implementation and outcomes of already established national  certification can give insights into potential best practices, which can be implemented in other  national contexts, after careful consideration of the characteristics of local education systems  and labour markets. For example, impact evaluations could compare certified cybersecurity  degrees with non-certified degrees and measure:   to what extent students improve their cybersecurity knowledge and skills;   to what extent certified degrees attract students who before enrolling are only marginally  interested in cybersecurity as a career opportunity;   the percentage of students landing a cybersecurity job, and the job’s role, sector, seniority and  wage level;   the time that students take to find a job after graduation;   the level of satisfaction of employers with graduates from certified cybersecurity programmes;   the level of satisfaction of educators with partnership with the industry;   the level of satisfaction of students with the degree;   other specific outcomes that certified programmes might produce, for example inclusion levels  of less represented segments of the population or increased collaboration with the national  cyber ecosystems.  The uptake and promotion of ENISA’s Cybersecurity Higher Education Database. The  Database will be a useful instrument for citizens only if it includes most, if not all, relevant  cybersecurity degrees in Europe. If the Database achieves this objective, it will also enable  further analysis of the evolving status of cybersecurity education in the EU. It will be in the best  interest of higher education institutions to proactively add their cybersecurity degrees to the  database, as this will be another way their educational offer can be further promoted and  publicised. In this context, it is important to find out:   what incentives are most likely to actively encourage higher education institutions to add their  degrees to the Database;   if the promotion of the Database in EU-wide awareness campaigns (such as the ECSM) could  be seen as a strong incentive;   how to make sure the Database becomes the premier source of information for citizens,  especially for students in secondary and tertiary education looking to continue the  development of their cybersecurity knowledge and skills with higher-level degrees.  CYBERSECURITY SKILLS DEVELOPMENT IN THE EU  December 2019  31  The nature and characteristics of the CSSS in the EU. This report aggregated the available  data to gain a better understanding of the CSSS, but also noted the lack of granular and  essential information on the shortage in the EU, especially in comparison with information  available in other countries. As the design of policies to mitigate the shortage should be  preceded by a detailed analysis of the problem, there are still too many gaps in our knowledge  of the EU CSSS that should be filled. For example, more research should answer current  practical concerns such as:   the number of vacancies that remain completely unfilled or stay open for longer than 3  months;   the depth of the cybersecurity market, represented by the ratio of the current cybersecurity  workforce to the number of cybersecurity vacancies;   the requirements in terms of years of professional experience, education and certification that  employers request, particularly for junior or mid-level cybersecurity jobs;   the median wage that EU cybersecurity professionals earn depending on their job role and  seniority level;   the job roles that are in highest demand, using already established frameworks (43);   the number of students who graduate with degrees that are directly relevant to a job in  cybersecurity;   the number of students with relevant cybersecurity degrees who do not end up in the  cybersecurity sector;   the potential effect of artificial intelligence and automation on the cybersecurity labour market.  Policy interventions are most effective in increasing the pipeline of professionals. To  make sure the shortage is addressed for what it is (a quantitative as well as a qualitative issue),  policy measures should ensure that more professionals come through the pipeline. Policies  such as degree certification most probably help to increase the quality of knowledge and skills,  but it is unclear to what extent they induce more people to join the sector. There are other  policies that have been deployed to increase career interest in cybersecurity, such as  competitions, challenges, career awareness campaigns and retraining programmes for  professionals already in the workforce. More should be known about:   the extent to which these programmes have been successful in achieving their outcomes;   whether or not they can be scaled up to meet current demand, especially in the light of what  seems to be a broader IT and STEM shortage.  Design of a comprehensive cybersecurity workforce development strategy. The design of  a comprehensive cybersecurity workforce development strategy that goes beyond policies  targeting only the education and training system. Instead, it should promote an active role for  employers in developing a national cybersecurity workforce. In this respect, ENISA can play a  role as a community builder and make sure all stakeholders’ needs are addressed in the  process. Although some governments have already designed quite comprehensive strategies to  deal with the shortage, most of the policy initiatives have been directed to spur changes in the  higher education system (44). Whereas these efforts have probably been necessary, more is  needed to create a virtuous cycle that guarantees a good match between workers’ supply and  labour market demands. Hence, employers should be fully integrated in the development of a  cybersecurity workforce and their role should be clarified.  43 For example the US National Initiative for Cybersecurity Education’s Cybersecurity Workforce Framework or the UK  Chartered Institute of Information Security Roles Framework.  44 For examples of these initiatives, see De Zan (2019).  CYBERSECURITY SKILLS DEVELOPMENT IN THE EU  December 2019  32  In particular, it should be investigated:   what policies can ease the transition from the education system to the labour market and  promote skill utilisation in cybersecurity;   to what extent employers can smooth current labour market bottlenecks by offering more  entry-level opportunities for graduates;   what kind of training schemes and other workplace innovation policies best facilitate the entry  and retention of cybersecurity employees;   to what extent employers should be responsible for training from scratch (and paying for it)  individuals with no cybersecurity relevant backgrounds if the education and training system is  unable to produce enough cybersecurity graduates.

It  poses threats with a high impact on the data, information technology systems and networks that  form the dorsal spine of modern societies. This shortage can be further analysed into two  concurrent issues: a quantitative one and a qualitative one. The quantitative issue is related to  the insufficient supply of cybersecurity professionals to meet the requirements of the job market  and the qualitative one is related to the inadequacy of professional skills to meet the market’s  needs.  This report focuses on the status of the cybersecurity education system and the inability to  attract more students to study cybersecurity and to produce graduates with the right  cybersecurity knowledge and skills. It argues that many of the current issues in cybersecurity  education could be ameliorated by redesigning educational and training pathways that define  knowledge and skills that students should possess upon graduation and after entering the  labour market.  This analysis describes how four states — Australia, France, the United Kingdom and the  United States — have attempted to rethink cybersecurity degrees using certification. These  certification schemes have been established for various purposes. The main objectives include  having more graduates with skills readily deployable by the industry, helping employers  understand skills and knowledge that students have developed in their academic careers, and  assisting people to choose their degree options. The ultimate impact of degree certification is to  reduce the CSSS through the promotion of cybersecurity education, research and awareness.  Currently, 387 cybersecurity degrees have been certified by the national authorities of these  four states. Although processes and criteria differ, certifications share some commonalities:   a specific focus and enough credits dedicated specifically to cybersecurity courses and  activities,   a structured curriculum, possibly with a practical/training component or specific types of  examinations and activities such as cybersecurity competitions,   a high-quality teaching faculty, which might include lecturers from industry,   a broader multi-/interdisciplinary focus,   external outreach activities and collaborations with the rest of the national cybersecurity  ecosystem,   information on degrees’ educational and employment outcomes.  In this context, ENISA has created the Cybersecurity Higher Education Database, an  interactive-list of cybersecurity degrees in EEA countries and Switzerland. The Database aims  to become the main point of reference for all European citizens looking to upskill their  cybersecurity knowledge and skills through a higher education degree. By checking the  Database, citizens should be able to make more informed decisions about cybersecurity  education and training, choosing the degree that is most suitable to their needs. In determining  what information workers and employers might find most useful, the Database has drawn  significantly from both the scientific literature (Section 3 of this report) and the criteria that are  used by national authorities when accrediting degrees (Section 4).  CYBERSECURITY SKILLS DEVELOPMENT IN THE EU  December 2019  4  There are three main considerations that this report sets forth:   Certification of cybersecurity degrees (as illustrated in Section 4) could be beneficial in  the design of a comprehensive cybersecurity workforce development strategy. It could  be a significant first step mainly because it clarifies what knowledge and skills the education  system is supposed to instil and, consequently, what employers can expect when students  graduate and apply for a job in their organisations. Future research is essential to identify the  key benefits of certifications for students and employers and if they effectively provide a more  skilled workforce.   However, determining what the right knowledge and skills means is only part of a much  wider problem, which is compounded by several other factors. Although certification  could be a step in the right direction, it cannot be considered the only solution to the shortage.  The CSSS is both a qualitative and a quantitative issue, and it should be tackled accordingly.  Increasing the quality of cybersecurity graduates through certified degrees is certainly useful  to make potential job candidates more employable, but not sufficient if the pipeline of  professionals is not plentiful enough to guarantee that job vacancies are filled. Future  research should identify what policies are able to incentivise seemingly large swaths of  students to enter academic and learning paths more conducive to cybersecurity careers.   Finally, and despite the focus of this report, policies should go beyond initiatives that  solely target national education and training systems. Policies would benefit greatly from  incorporating measures dealing with issues that are generated on the demand side of the  labour market. Currently, there is ample evidence suggesting that the CSSS is affected by  problems that originate from the demand side of the labour market equation, such as  employers’ unwillingness to invest in cybersecurity human capital, and high-level entry  requirements. Because of that, it would be particularly promising to find solutions easing the  transition from the education system into the labour market and thus encourage employers to  become systematic players in the development of a national cybersecurity workforce.  In the light of these considerations, this report recommends further investigating the following:   The impact of cybersecurity degree certification on the cybersecurity skills shortage. A  rigorous and systematic analysis of the implementation and outcomes of already established  national certifications can provide insights into potential best practices that can be  implemented in other countries;   The uptake and promotion of ENISA’s Cybersecurity Higher Education Database. The  Database will be a useful instrument for citizens and employers only if it includes most  cybersecurity degrees in the EU. If this is achieved, it will also enable further analysis of the  changing state of EU cybersecurity education.   The nature and characteristics of the cybersecurity skills shortage in the EU. This report  aggregates the available data to gain a better understanding of the CSSS in the EU, but also  notes the lack of granular and essential information. As the design of policies to mitigate the  shortage should be preceded by a full understanding of it, there are still too many gaps in  knowledge that should be filled.   The policy interventions that are most effective in increasing the pipeline of  professionals. To make sure the shortage is addressed both as a quantitative and a  qualitative issue, mitigation strategies should include measures that ensure the pipeline of  professionals is effectively augmented. There are policies that have been deployed to  increase interest in cybersecurity careers, and more needs to be known about the extent to  which these programmes have been successful and if they could be scaled up to meet the  growing labour market demand.  CYBERSECURITY SKILLS DEVELOPMENT IN THE EU  December 2019  5   How to design comprehensive cybersecurity workforce development strategies that go  beyond policies targeting only the education and training system. Such strategies should  promote the role of active employers in developing a national cybersecurity workforce.  Although some comprehensive strategies addressing the shortage have been established,  most of the attention has been directed towards spurring changes in higher education. More is  needed to create a virtuous cycle that guarantees a good match between the supply of  workers and the requirements of jobs, taking into account the primary role that employers  should have in sustaining the cybersecurity workforce. In this respect, ENISA can play a role  as a community builder and make sure all stakeholders’ needs are addressed in the process.  CYBERSECURITY SKILLS DEVELOPMENT IN THE EU  December 2019  6  1. INTRODUCTION  The cybersecurity skills shortage (CSSS) is the lack of qualified cybersecurity professionals in  the labour market (McGuinness, Pouliakas, & Redmond, 2018). This is usually characterised by  unfilled or hard-to-fill vacancies and raises in the wages that professionals with relevant skills in  and knowledge of cybersecurity can command.  The shortfall of a cybersecurity workforce capable of handling cybersecurity tasks represents an  issue for both economic development and national security. The rapid digitisation of the global  economy means that data, networks and systems have become the spine of modern societies.  Threats to their confidentiality, integrity or availability suggest that countries might see their  economic flourishing being hampered (The Council of Economic Advisers, 2018). Moreover,  cybersecurity issues have been elevated to national security threats (Bate, 2017). Having  realised the negative consequences that the escalation of cybersecurity attacks might have  even in the offline world, countries have been proactively preparing countermeasures to  counteract malign operations, while meeting in international fora to agree on norms of  acceptable behaviour in cyberspace.  Hence, having enough professionals to secure information systems is becoming an absolute  priority for policymakers, as is often expressed in countries’ cybersecurity strategies (De Zan,  2019).  The cybersecurity skill shortage is a multidimensional policy issue that is compounded by  several factors. Among these is that the relevant stakeholders — government, academia and  industry — have expressed the need to redesign educational and training pathways and, by  doing that, to define the right cybersecurity knowledge and skills that students should be  equipped with once they graduate with a degree in cybersecurity. In the context of the shortage,  employers lament that is hard for them to recognise the skills that potential cybersecurity  candidates have, or to find them at all. Therefore, getting stakeholders to agree on what these  right cybersecurity knowledge and skills are is an important step to overcome one of the major  hurdles that is currently impeding the establishment of a sustained cybersecurity workforce.  The aim of this report is to analyse what policies countries have adopted to determine the  cybersecurity knowledge and skills that students should have acquired before graduating with a  cybersecurity degree. This research uses the experiences of four states — Australia, France,  the United Kingdom and the United States — and describes the processes and criteria through  which these states certify their national cybersecurity degrees.  Subsequently, this report explains how this information was used as input to the creation of the  Cybersecurity Higher Education Database, whose goal is to become the premier source of  information for EU citizens looking to brush up their cybersecurity knowledge and skills. It has  the ultimate goal of linking citizens with high-quality cybersecurity degrees and therefore of  closing information gaps that have the potential to worsen the CSSS.  This report is organised as follows:   Section 2 defines the cybersecurity skills shortage and explains the major factors behind it;   Section 3 delves into the origins of one of the causes of the shortage, explaining why major  stakeholders seem to agree on the need to set standards for cybersecurity degrees through  certification;  This report  focuses on the  state of the  cybersecurity  education and  actions to be  taken in order  to form  graduates with  the right  cybersecurity  knowledge  and skills.  CYBERSECURITY SKILLS DEVELOPMENT IN THE EU  December 2019  7   Section 4 reports the processes and criteria that Australia, France, the United Kingdom and  the United States have established to certify cybersecurity degrees;   Section 5 describes EU policies in digital and cybersecurity education and the creation of the  Cybersecurity Higher Education Database;   Section 6 discusses the implications of establishing certification for cybersecurity degrees and  gives some recommendations on activities and/or research that could be implemented to  enhance our understanding of the shortage, to mitigate it more effectively.  CYBERSECURITY SKILLS DEVELOPMENT IN THE EU  December 2019  8  2. THE CYBERSECURITY  SKILLS SHORTAGE  This section attempts to clarify the nature of the CSSS by presenting the available evidence on  this issue. First it introduces general information on the CSSS worldwide, and then it focuses on  the shortage in the EU. This section makes the point that the shortage can be attributed to  various causes, including employers and workplace malpractice, but also some issues  concerning cybersecurity education, which will be thoroughly presented in Section 3.  2.1 THE CYBERSECURITY SKILLS SHORTAGE WORLDWIDE  There are various indicators suggesting that cybersecurity is one of the most constrained sectors  in the labour market. Figures based on the US market (Burningglass, 2019) shows that in 2019:   cybersecurity job postings had increased by 94 % since 2013, while information technology  (IT) vacancies had increased by only 30 %;   cybersecurity jobs accounted for 13 % of all IT jobs, but their salaries commanded a 16 %  premium over other IT ones (1);   cybersecurity vacancies also took 20 % longer to fill than those in other IT occupations;   the ratio of currently employed cybersecurity professionals to vacancies had not changed  since 2015-16, being stable at 2.3, whereas by comparison there were 5.8 employed workers  for any other job in the economy (2).  Although results should be interpreted with caution (3), industry research almost unanimously  concludes that a CSSS is well established.  The 2019 annual report by the Enterprise Strategy Group and the Information Systems Security  Association (Oltsik, 2019) claims that the CSSS has an impact on 74 % of organisations. The  main consequences of the CSSS are increased workload on existing staff, inability to train or to  learn new technologies, and aggressive recruitment tactics by headhunters to secure talented  professionals.  Similarly, the Information Systems Audit and Control Association (ISACA, 2019) found that 58 %  of organisations have unfilled cybersecurity vacancies and that for 60 % of them it takes a  minimum of 3 months before a position is filled. The main reason that these positions remain  unfilled is the apparent lack of qualified professionals applying; 29 % of organisations report that  fewer than 25 % of candidates are well qualified for the job.  Finally, the 2019 cybersecurity workforce study by the International Information System Security  Certification Consortium ((ISC)², 2019) estimated the current global shortage to be around 4.07  million professionals and that the workforce would need to grow by 145 % to meet labour  market demand. In the survey, approximately 65 % of organisations declare they have a  shortage of staff for cybersecurity tasks; among cybersecurity professionals, the lack of skilled  and experienced cybersecurity security personnel is the top concern; finally, 51 % of  1 The average advertised salary was almost USD 94 000.  2 These statistics are probably more representative of the US than the EU cybersecurity labour market.  3 Industry research employing surveys falls short of providing strong scientific results on the incidence of the CSSS. These  surveys are beleaguered by serious methodological issues to such an extent that caution should be exercised when using  these data to design public policies. Issues include non-randomisation of the population surveyed, poor choice of indicators  and doubtful quantification of the shortage at the international level. However, this research is useful insofar as it underlines  a policy issue that has been underinvestigated and needs careful consideration from both researchers and policymakers.  CYBERSECURITY SKILLS DEVELOPMENT IN THE EU  December 2019  9  organisations claim that, because of the lack of personnel, they are at moderate-extreme risk of  suffering a security breach.  2.2 THE CYBERSECURITY SKILLS SHORTAGE IN THE EUROPEAN  UNION  There is a lack of data on the CSSS in the EU, but the most specific information can usually be  found in selected industry reports, in a number of national policy documents and in locally  conducted research.  In 2017, the European Commission suggested that the main reason why some Member States  had been better able to establish computer emergency response teams was a ‘cybersecurity  skills gap’ throughout the EU. Indeed, consultations with Member States had identified a  ‘cybersecurity awareness and skills gap in the population’ as being among the key obstacles to  building a secure cyberspace. Notwithstanding the availability of almost 500 university and  training courses across Europe, ‘the cybersecurity skills gap across all sectors remains a major  challenge and the talent pool is not keeping up the pace’(4)  The 2019 (ISC)² cybersecurity workforce study ((ISC)², 2019) asserted that there is a shortage  of approximately 291 000 cybersecurity professionals in Europe up from the previous estimate  of 142 000 professionals that had been given in the 2018 report.  This result is complemented by what participants in a Symantec CISO Forum said in February  2019 (Symantec, 2019), when they concluded that hiring cybersecurity personnel takes at least  6 months, with between 9 and 12 months not being unusual. On a similar note, a survey  commissioned by the cybersecurity firm Trend Micro (Trend Micro, 2019) discovered that 33 %  of 1 125 chief information security officers in the United States and the EU have difficulty hiring  new talent and 49 % believe this might expose their organisations to greater risks.  More alarmingly, IT professionals in Germany, France and the United Kingdom and around the  world are convinced that the shortage of cybersecurity personnel is here to stay, as they predict  that an average of 16 % cybersecurity vacancies may go unfilled by 2020 (CSIS, 2016).  Besides industry reports, statements from governments and evidence from research conducted  nationally indicate that various Member States of the EU have similar labour market issues in  the cybersecurity sector.  Table 1: Quotes on the cybersecurity skills shortage in the EU  Member State Government statements Other reports  Italy  ‘Italy has a vast problem in relation  to cybersecurity education.’  (Presidenza del Consiglio dei  Ministri, 2018)  ‘Italy seems to be affected by the  same challenges that are impeding a  smooth match between cybersecurity  supply and demand as in other  countries.’ (De Zan, 2019)  France  ‘The content and number of initial  training and higher education  programmes for cybersecurity  professions do not meet the needs of  businesses and administrations.’  (Premier Ministre, 2015)  ‘Cybersecurity faces a constant talent  shortage. While French companies  and administrations are becoming  aware of cybersecurity challenges,  more than 5 000 jobs are currently  available in this sector in France.’  (PwC, 2019)  4 https://ec.europa.eu/transparency/regdoc/rep/other/SWD-2017-295-F1-EN-0-0.PDF  https://ec.europa.eu/transparency/regdoc/rep/other/SWD-2017-295-F1-EN-0-0.PDF  CYBERSECURITY SKILLS DEVELOPMENT IN THE EU  December 2019  10  Germany -  ‘The shortage of IT security specialists  no longer affects only the economy,  but also increasingly the public  sector.’ (Schuetze, 2018)  Netherlands  ‘There is a growing demand from the  business community and public  authorities for innovative solutions to  cybersecurity issues and well-trained  personnel. This shortage on the  labour market leads to scarce  cybersecurity knowledge in  organizations, which makes them  insufficiently resilient to digital  threats.’ (National Coordinator for  Security & Counterterrorism, 2018)  ‘Many organizations experience a  shortage of cybersecurity  professionals.’ (Centraal Planbureau,  2018)  Spain  ‘Spain should have technical and  human resources to give it the  necessary technological autonomy  and appropriate skills training for  secure use of cyberspace, making  cybersecurity the key enabler for an  entrepreneurial nation.’ (Presidencia  del Gobierno, 2019)  ‘The lack of professionals specialised  in cybersecurity is one of the main  challenges currently facing both the  public and private sectors in the  current environment.’ (Europa Press,  2017)  United Kingdom  “The challenge is much more complex  than simply a shortage of  cybersecurity professionals — there is  a broader cybersecurity capability gap  in the UK.’ (HM Government, 2018)  “Of the 1.32 million UK businesses,  we estimate that around 710,000 have  a basic technical cybersecurity skills  gap and 407,000 have a high-level  technical cybersecurity skills gap.’  (Pedley, McHenry, Motha, & Navin,  2018)  2.3 THE CAUSES OF THE SHORTAGE  Four main causes might be attributed to the cybersecurity skills shortage Two of them can be  broadly credited to issues within the workplace and exacerbated by employers, while the  remaining two are associated with issues affecting the education and training system (5).This  section provides evidence on the former, and the next section is focused on the latter.  Two elements that compound the shortage can be attributed to employers or more generally to  the labour market. The first one is the high expectations that employers have about the skill  level of candidates that the current labour market can offer, while the second one is the lack of  sufficient and suitable training provided to employees.  The cybersecurity job market is relatively immature and very dynamic, and the job specifications  are highly dependent on the organisation size and sector. In particular, the job specifications are  different if the organisation operates outside the cybersecurity industry. In this case, recruitment  in cybersecurity roles is rare and mostly limited to large firms (Pedley, McHenry, Motha, &  Navin, 2018).  Small and medium-sized enterprises not specialised in job security tend to prefer generalist IT  staff with some understanding of cybersecurity, whereas larger firms and firms specialised in  cybersecurity have need of specialised staff focused on one of the subdisciplines of  cybersecurity (6).  5 See https://www.newamerica.org/cybersecurity-initiative/reports/cybersecurity-workforce-development/.  6 The types of advanced professional roles are wide ranging, representing the diversity of the industries and the services  required by the outsourcing company. Some of the typical job roles required by the market include security architecture,  security engineering, security operation, forensic analysis and penetration testing.  https://www.newamerica.org/cybersecurity-initiative/reports/cybersecurity-workforce-development/  CYBERSECURITY SKILLS DEVELOPMENT IN THE EU  December 2019  11  In the United Kingdom, businesses believe that the shortage has its origins in the novelty and  immaturity of cybersecurity as a profession, the lack of graduates in science, technology,  engineering and mathematics (STEM)-related disciplines, and the poor awareness of  cybersecurity as a career option. In observing that employers value experience more than  academic degrees, it is, however, recognised that businesses should do more to equip students  with hands-on experience through internships and apprenticeships (De Zan, 2019).  Furthermore, employers are not offering the right level of training, which is stymieing both the  creation of a sustained workforce pipeline and the professional development of current  employees. If training is not offered, junior or mid-level professionals with a more general  background, but no specialised knowledge and skills in cybersecurity, cannot further develop  the necessary intellectual, managerial and technological skills to perform their daily activities.  So, if adequate training is not provided, professionals will probably not be able to keep up with  the pace of constant innovation at which their adversaries run. As a senior decision-maker  within the EU puts it:  The shortage is really dominated by a lack of understanding and adaption on our way of training  people and fostering their development in the industry based on the way cybersecurity is  evolving. Anonymous interview, (De Zan, 2019) p.37  Therefore, employers have potentially a very important role to play in reducing the current  shortage and this should be carefully considered when designing cybersecurity workforce  development policies.  Nonetheless, there are at least two other factors worsening the CSSS that can be attributed to  issues within the education and training system. One is the inability to encourage more students  to enter academic pathways that are more easily associated with a cybersecurity job; the other  is the failure to produce candidates with the right knowledge and skills.  The next section provides an overview of the issues that academia, industry and governments  have found to be afflicting cybersecurity education, with a particular focus on the difficulties that  academia faces in equipping graduates with cybersecurity knowledge and skills that would  make them more employable in the labour market.  CYBERSECURITY SKILLS DEVELOPMENT IN THE EU  December 2019  12  3. CHALLENGES IN  CYBERSECURITY  EDUCATION AND TRAINING  This section provides an overview of the status of cybersecurity education, highlighting the  major issues that stakeholders from governments, academia and the industry have noted about  the field (7).  The European Cyber Security Organisation argues that governments should tackle the  cybersecurity skills gap through more educational and training offers. Curriculum designers are  failing to realise the importance of having a multidisciplinary curriculum. (European Cyber  Security Organisation, 2018) To be able to do their job well, professionals need an  understanding of a variety of cybersecurity knowledge areas, ranging from more technical topics  to social and legal aspects. Whereas it is true that universities should not be training for the  labour market, the educational and training system should ensure the employability of students.  Consequently, one of the objectives of the educational and training system should be to give  students a holistic understanding of cybersecurity, while at the same time preparing them for a  job. A possible solution to these challenges would be to better integrate the industry with  educational institutions.  The Europe Policy Committee of the Association for Computing Machinery (Gagliardi, Hankin,  Gal-Ezer, McGettrick, & Meitern, 2016) indicates that students should be taught computing  before entering university, and cybersecurity concerns should be included. To do that, savvy  teachers are essential and should be expected to have a formal education as well as being well  trained on the subject. Cybersecurity should be incorporated in higher education computing  curricula to make sure graduates enter the workforce knowing the ethical implications of their  work and how to develop secure systems, while acknowledging that cybersecurity is a  comprehensive system issue. On a similar note, (Krutz & Richards, 2017) suggest that only 1  out of the 36 best computer science degrees in the United States requires a course in  cybersecurity. Students who show a basic understanding of cybersecurity usually have a  competitive advantage over other candidates when they apply for jobs. Therefore, it is time for  universities to start teaching more cybersecurity (8).  (Conklin, Cline, & Roosa, 2014) posit that one of the biggest concerns in cybersecurity  education is students’ lack of hands-on experience, resulting in a skills mismatch between what  the industry would like to see in a candidate and the skills that they actually possess. The  central theme of this concern is training versus education. Education tends to focus on the  7 This section reviews the major issues in cybersecurity education found in the literature. Although this might not always  portray current cybersecurity education issues within the EU, most of these problems seem to be generalisable to a few EU  national education and training systems.  8 Similar and complementary views are expressed by (Siraj, Taylor, Kaza, & Ghafoor, 2015), who also champion better  integration of security in computer science curricula, although they realise the education system faces big challenges such  as lack of faculty able to teach security, and a scarcity of teaching resources or spare rooms in computer science degrees.  A complementary perspective is given by Rowe et al. (Rowe, Lunt, & Ekstrom, 2011). They argue that computer science  provides an excellent basis to build an advanced cybersecurity curriculum, but currently there are various aspects that are  not covered by IT programmes, which should: (a) include a pervasive up-to-date security component in their curriculum  structures; (b) familiarise students with cybersecurity terminology; (c) teach students in a cybersecurity context; and (d)  introduce an advanced focus on the prepare, defend and act principles.  Mission-specific  and purpose-driven  cyber security  degrees would  greatly improve the  success of students  moving into the  workforce.  (Henry, 2017)  The IT industry  continues to evolve  at a rapid pace, and  despite the obvious  advancements in IT  education, most  graduates are not  ready to help  companies in  ramping up security  immediately.  (Kaspersky Lab,  2016)  CYBERSECURITY SKILLS DEVELOPMENT IN THE EU  December 2019  13  reasons, the theory and the mechanisms behind the material (9). The industry would like  workers who are ready to work from day 1. However, technology changes fast and the students  need to learn transferable skills that can be used throughout a lifelong career. Therefore, the  authors suggest that cybersecurity degree providers should balance the employability of the  students with providing the foundations for future professionals to update their skills in such a  dynamic environment.  (Vishik & Heisel, 2015) provide one of the few portraits of cybersecurity education in the EU. In  their research, they found cybersecurity education to be growing, but unevenly across Europe.  This is why many gaps still remain. According to them, different conceptualisations of the  science of cybersecurity have led to a variety of educational offerings, creating obstacles to the  creation of a common cybersecurity educational framework. They argue that there are  constraints on those students who wish to acquire an all-round skill set in cybersecurity, as  graduates have to specialise in either technical or societal cybersecurity issues, but not both.  Another challenge is the responsiveness of cybersecurity curricula to the evolution of the field.  So far, cybersecurity curricula have struggled to keep up, mainly because they lack  mechanisms to quickly incorporate material on emerging threats or new skills (10).  To sum up, this review found that there are several issues affecting cybersecurity education,  which include the lack of cybersecurity educators, poor interaction with the industry, little  understanding of the labour market, outdated or unrealistic platforms in education environments  and difficulties in keeping pace with the outside world.  Many other issues revolve around the idea of redefining educational and training pathways to  give a more unified standard for the knowledge and skills that students should acquire when  they enrol in a cybersecurity degree. When stakeholders stress the need to teach more  cybersecurity in computer science degrees, underline the poor alignment between education  and labour market demands, propose more multidisciplinary expertise and encourage educators  to promote more hands-on education, they are suggesting rethinking cybersecurity curricula and  educational experiences, taking all these factors into account.  Redefining curricula and educational paths is one of the major challenges regarding the  cybersecurity skill shortage. In fact, major stakeholders in the debate do not necessarily agree  on what the right cybersecurity knowledge and skills really are and we now witness a situation  where employers keep complaining that it is hard for them to identify and recruit graduates with  the right cybersecurity skills and knowledge when they hire for entry-level positions (ISACA,  2019).  There is a case for establishing a baseline in cybersecurity education and agreeing on the  knowledge and skills that degree courses should teach. One way to address this challenge is  for the relevant stakeholders — namely academia, governments and employers — to sit around  a table and discuss the basic knowledge and skills that students should develop when they  undertake a computing degree with a focus on cybersecurity. Because of their central role in  providing overarching educational frameworks, governments are more likely to take the lead in  setting up this partnership to improve the quality of cybersecurity education, and ENISA could  assist in the process of coordination among the EU initiatives.  9 Teaching a student to develop and implement specific firewall rules on a router is training. Teaching a student about  firewall rules, how they are used to implement a perimeter defence, and their strengths and weaknesses is the role of  education.  10 In sum, education and training are facing difficulties in matching the dynamic requirements of the workplace, even though  a number of EU Member States are making efforts to better link universities with the industry. This disconnection apparently  occurs because programmes are limited and do not have enough funding. To deal with these issues, Vishik and Heisel  formulate the following recommendations: (a) a multidisciplinary focus; (b) responsiveness to changes in technology and  societal environments; (c) end-to-end skill development; (d) alignment of curricula and training with demand for skills; (e)  using appropriate methodologies for teaching cybersecurity at all levels, from awareness to specialised expertise; and (f)  bringing all Member States to agree upon a baseline of cybersecurity education and skills indicators.  Academia,  governments  and employers  need to discuss  the cybersecurity  knowledge and  skills that  students should  develop during a  computing  degree course.  ENISA could  assist in the  process of  coordination  among the EU  cybersecurity  educational  initiatives.  CYBERSECURITY SKILLS DEVELOPMENT IN THE EU  December 2019  14  The next session describes how Australia, France, the United Kingdom and the United States  have set up certification schemes for cybersecurity degrees.  CYBERSECURITY SKILLS DEVELOPMENT IN THE EU  December 2019  15  4. THE CERTIFICATION OF  CYBERSECURITY DEGREES  This section describes the main criteria and processes through which four states — Australia,  France, the United Kingdom and the United States — have established certification schemes for  their national cybersecurity degrees. There are currently 387 degrees that are certified by  national authorities of these four states (11). These states established certification for  cybersecurity degrees mainly for the following reasons:   to have more graduates with skills readily deployable by the industry;   to help employers understand skills and knowledge that students have developed in their  academic careers;   to assist students in making more informed decisions about their degree choices.  When national authorities award certification, they attest that a degree meets the standards and  criteria that a group of experts considers necessary for a degree focusing on cybersecurity.  These certifications are overseen by states’ main cybersecurity national institutions, namely the  Agence Nationale de la Sécurité des Systèmes d’Information (ANSSI) in France, the  Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the National Security Agency (NSA) in the United  States, and the National Cyber Security Center (NCSC) in the United Kingdom, with the  exception of Australia, where the process is supervised by the Department of Education.  The expected ultimate impact of the certification of cybersecurity degrees is to reduce the CSSS  and mitigate national vulnerabilities through the promotion of cybersecurity education, research  and awareness.  4.1 AUSTRALIA  In Australia, two academic centres of cybersecurity excellence (ACCSEs) were established at  the University of Melbourne and Edith Cowan University in 2017. As part of the Australian  cybersecurity strategy, the establishment of the two ACCSEs directly supports one of the key  themes (building ‘A cyber smart nation’) of the country’s strategic vision and follows an  investment of AUD 1.9 million over 4 years by the government (Australian Government -  Department of Education, Academic Centres of Cyber Security Excellence (ACCSE), 2019).  This initiative is also aligned with the Cyber Security Science and Research Priorities, which aim  to enhance Australian leadership in innovative cybersecurity research and innovation. The  applications to become ACCSEs were assessed by a working group appointed by the Minister  for Education and Training (Australian Government - Department of Education, Academic  Centres of Cyber Security Excellence Program Guidelines, 2017).  11 These four were chosen because, to the best of our knowledge, they are the only ones that have established a rigorous  certification process for cybersecurity degrees. To ensure relevant cases were included, ENISA sent a request to EU  Member States in order to verify the existence of cybersecurity degree certifications. Although the Netherlands has  established some criteria to create a national map of cybersecurity degrees (https://www.dcypher.nl/en/map-dutch- cybersecurity-higher-education), only France and the United Kingdom have a formalised process about which information is  publicly available. For countries outside the EU, we checked national cybersecurity strategies and other policy documents  to verify whether or not other countries with a strong digital and cybersecurity posture (as defined by De Zan, 2019, pp. 78- 79) have degree certifications, but no other case studies were found.  https://www.dcypher.nl/en/map-dutch-cybersecurity-higher-education https://www.dcypher.nl/en/map-dutch-cybersecurity-higher-education  CYBERSECURITY SKILLS DEVELOPMENT IN THE EU  December 2019  16  Overall, ACCSEs (Australian Government - Department of Education, Academic Centres of Cyber  Security Excellence (ACCSE), 2019) target the national skills shortage of both technical and non-  technical cybersecurity expertise, and their intended impact is to:   encourage more students to study cybersecurity as an academic discipline;   increase the number of cybersecurity graduates with skills ready to be deployed in Australia’s  industry;   support cybersecurity research addressing key cybersecurity issues.  The Australian government also set short- and long-term outcomes that should be achieved with  this policy. Among the short-term results, ACCSEs are expected to:   advance collaboration with other universities, businesses and the government;   increase interest in their own programmes and activities;   have more internships supported by the private sector.  In the long term, the government expects ACCSEs to:   increase the number of skilled cybersecurity graduates entering the workforce and improve  the basic cybersecurity knowledge of non-cybersecurity graduates;   promote the provision of professional executive training;   increase the number of cybersecurity professionals coming from under-represented segments  of society;   conduct research projects that contribute to the cybersecurity strategy and the Science and  Research Priorities and to increase commercialisation outputs.  To become an ACCSE, a university must propose an integrated strategy to deliver degree,  research and professional programmes that will meet certain outcomes (Australian Government  - Department of Education, Academic Centres of Cyber Security Excellence Program Guidelines,  2017). In particular:   degree programmes should:  o be coherent and provide specific cybersecurity skills;  o have opportunities for workplace training and business mentoring;  o favour exchanges between the stakeholders within the cyber ecosystem;  o maintain sustained enrolment, strong graduation rates and employment outcomes;  o make cybersecurity courses available to students with no IT background;  o develop a plan to make cybersecurity more inclusive for women and indigenous  populations;   research programmes should:  o be in fields included in Excellence in Research for Australia;  o deliver high-calibre research outputs under the framework of the Science and  Research Priorities;  o have a strategy for engagement with stakeholders that make use of research  outputs;  o have a track record of commercialised research;   professional programmes should:  o be designed for both a technical and a non-technical audience;  o produce IT generalists in cybersecurity as well as more specific profiles that the  labour market needs.  CYBERSECURITY SKILLS DEVELOPMENT IN THE EU  December 2019  17  4.2 FRANCE  In France, ANSSI is responsible for the SecNumedu labelling programme, whose aim is to  inform students and employers that a degree meets the criteria of cybersecurity teaching and  training as defined by ANSSI. SecNumedu is based on criteria developed by ANSSI in  partnership with the industry, academia, professional associations and the Ministry of  Education.  Certification lasts for 3 years and allows degrees to be displayed on ANSSI’s website (12).  As a prerequisite for the application, degrees can be labelled if they meet one of the following  criteria.   The university course awards a bachelor’s (licence) or master’s degree.   An engineering degree (13) is recognised by the French Commission des Titres d’Ingénieurs.   The mastère spécialisé is recognised by the French Conférence des Grandes Ecoles.   Level I and II professional certifications are included in the Répertoire national des  certifications professionnelles (RNCP).  In order to be certified, a cybersecurity programme has to sign a convention and make an  application to ANSSI, which has 2 months to assess it (14). Within ANSSI, the Centre de  formation à la sécurité des systèmes d’information (CFSSI) is the body in charge of evaluating  the application.  By signing the convention, the educational/training organisation commits to following the  professional paths of alumni for 5 years after graduation, to provide updated information on the  degree each year and to accept monitoring and verification by ANSSI (15).  In the application, training organisations should highlight key elements such as the following (16).   Dominant content of the training. Training is considered predominantly technical when  more than 50 % of the course is dedicated to practical technical activities (17); it is regarded as  predominantly organisational when the practical technical activities account for less than  50 % of the course (18).   Level of competence in security. The training organisation should indicate the levels of  proficiency in security knowledge and skills at which students are supposed to start and  conclude the academic programme (19); higher proficiency levels require practical activities to  be included in the programme, such as laboratory work.   Distribution of teaching practices. The practical elements of the training must be at least  50 % of the course.   Course volume and work dedicated to security. To be eligible for the label, taught courses  and practical activities in cybersecurity should cover 70 % of the total or more than 400 hours.   Legal aspects. Personal data protection and other legal topics must be included in the  training programme.  12 https://www.ssi.gouv.fr/en/cybersecurity-in-france/formations/secnumedu-labeling-of-higher-education-courses-in- cybersecurity  13 Note that in France an engineering degree is basically a master’s degree in a technology field, whereas the mastère  spécialisé is a 1-year post-master’s specialisation programme.  14 See https://www.ssi.gouv.fr/particulier/formations/secnumedu/f-a-q-secnumedu/.  15 See https://www.ssi.gouv.fr/uploads/2017/11/anssi-secnumedu-charte_v2-2016-07-22_en.pdf.  16 The following list of criteria is non-exhaustive. For the full list, please refer to  https://www.ssi.gouv.fr/uploads/2017/11/anssi-secnumedu-f-02_v2.0_dossier_en.pdf  17These might include, for example, software development, reverse engineering, cryptography and secure development.  18Organisational courses typically include methodological work, risk analysis and organisational audits, definition of security  policies, etc.  19 The levels are: no skills, awareness, application, mastery and specialised. An organisation cannot claim graduates’ level  of competence to be application, mastery or specialised without practical activities in their programmes.  https://www.ssi.gouv.fr/en/cybersecurity-in-france/formations/secnumedu-labeling-of-higher-education-courses-in-cybersecurity https://www.ssi.gouv.fr/en/cybersecurity-in-france/formations/secnumedu-labeling-of-higher-education-courses-in-cybersecurity https://www.ssi.gouv.fr/particulier/formations/secnumedu/f-a-q-secnumedu/ https://www.ssi.gouv.fr/uploads/2017/11/anssi-secnumedu-charte_v2-2016-07-22_en.pdf https://www.ssi.gouv.fr/uploads/2017/11/anssi-secnumedu-f-02_v2.0_dossier_en.pdf  CYBERSECURITY SKILLS DEVELOPMENT IN THE EU  December 2019  18   Alumni professional paths follow-up. The organisation should keep track of the types of  jobs that alumni obtain in the first 5 years after graduation.   Teaching faculty. The application should give the profiles of the teaching faculty, including  the ratio of faculty with a pure academic background to faculty with an industry background.   Professional certification. The training organisation should state whether the degree  includes courses dedicated to preparing students for a professional certificate or certification  is obtained by the students during the programme.  At the time of writing, there are 59 degree programmes that can boast the SecNumedu label:   13 masters’,   7 mastères spécialisés,   17 ingénieurs (including one ingénieur de spécialisation),   3 RNCP Level I   19 Licence pro  4.3 UNITED KINGDOM  In the United Kingdom, the National Cyber Security Centre (NSCS) certifies bachelors’,  integrated masters’ and masters’ degrees, and apprenticeships. This initiative directly stems  from the UK Cyber Security Strategy 2016-21, which states that ‘the UK requires more talented  and qualified cybersecurity professionals’20. According to the NCSC (NCSC, 2019), certification  should help:   universities to attract highly talented students;   employers to understand skills and knowledge that students possess;   students to make more informed decisions on the value of their degrees.  To be in scope, degrees should have a minimum amount of credits in computer science or  cybersecurity, depending on whether they are bachelors’ or masters’ degrees. For example, a  bachelor’s degree in computer science and cybersecurity should have a minimum of 160 credits  in taught computer science courses (21) and at least 90 credits in cybersecurity topics (22);  masters’ degrees in general cybersecurity should have 70 % of their taught modules on  cybersecurity; masters’ degrees in digital forensics should have 70 % of their taught modules on  digital forensics subject areas.  The NCSC provides either a provisional or a full certification, which is valid for 5 years (23).  Universities that apply for certification need to submit an application detailing:   the teaching faculty,   the taught cybersecurity courses,   the types of examinations used to assess students,   how students do their dissertations,   how many students enrol and their grades,   students’ feedback on the course.  20https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/567242/national_cyber _security_strategy_2016.pdf  21 The computer science subject areas come from the computer science curricula 2013 developed by the Association for  Computing Machinery and the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers.  22 Numbers of cybersecurity credits vary according to Pathways. The cybersecurity topics (i.e. ‘Security Discipline Principles  and Skills Groups’) stem from the IISP Information Security Skills Framework.  23 See https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/information/ncsc-degree-certification-call-new-applicants-0.  https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/567242/national_cyber_security_strategy_2016.pdf https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/567242/national_cyber_security_strategy_2016.pdf https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/information/ncsc-degree-certification-call-new-applicants-0  CYBERSECURITY SKILLS DEVELOPMENT IN THE EU  December 2019  19  Applications from universities are examined by a panel with members from the NCSC, other  government departments, industry, professional bodies and academia. Each of the components  of the application is marked 0 to 4 depending on the level of evidence provided. The average for  all sections must be at least 3, which means that the evidence provided is of a good  standard (24).  At the time of writing, in the United Kingdom there are 33 certified degrees with either  provisional or full certification (NCSC, 2019):   4 certified bachelors’ degrees (1 full certification; 3 provisional certifications),   3 provisionally certified integrated masters’ degrees,   26 certified masters’ degrees (16 full certifications; 10 provisional certifications).  In 2013, the centres for doctoral training (CDTs) in cybersecurity were established as a part of  the 2011 national cybersecurity programme. A CDT in cybersecurity provides a 4-year  programme: enrolled doctoral students attend a taught component in their first year and  undertake a specific research project with a clear focus on cybersecurity in the remaining 3  years. The taught component should account for 25 % of the doctoral programme, enhance  students’ technical knowledge across all areas of cybersecurity, be relevant to business  demands, expose students to activities other than research (for example public engagement).  The subsequent research element should directly draw from the taught component, reflect the  expertise of the teaching staff, contribute to a multidisciplinary understanding of cybersecurity  and possibly have an impact beyond academia (EPSRC, 2012).  Universities applying to become CDTs in cybersecurity need to produce evidence of the  following.   Scope of the proposed CDT. The university should indicate the main cybersecurity domain it  wishes to focus on while emphasising the multidisciplinary scope of the programme.   Strategy and alignment. It should provide an explanation of the CDT’s strategy and how this  aligns with the United Kingdom’s cybersecurity needs; it should detail how the admission  process of students will take place and what kind of profiles suit the CDT’s strategy.   International standing. It should provide evidence of success in the delivery of masters’ or  doctoral courses and production of scientific research.   Taught course component. It should describe the curriculum of the courses provided and  provision of external training, highlight past successes in the delivery of similar courses and  have a plan to teach non-technical/transferable skills.   Research component. It should describe the process for generating dissertations and  potential supervisory arrangements.   Engagement with industry and users. A plan for engagement with the industry should be  set out, including dissemination and outreach strategies.   Management. The application should describe the management structure, including a list of  key academic staff and a nomination for director.  4.4 UNITED STATES  In the United States, the NSA sponsors centres of academic excellence (CAEs) in  cybersecurity. There are two types of CAE: cyberdefence and cyber operations.  The DHS and the NSA jointly sponsor the CAE in cyberdefence (CAE-CD) programme, which  started in 1999 (NSA-CSS, 2019).  24 See https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/files/Certification-Degree-Apprenticeships-Issue-1_0-Feb-2019.pdf.  https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/files/Certification-Degree-Apprenticeships-Issue-1_0-Feb-2019.pdf  CYBERSECURITY SKILLS DEVELOPMENT IN THE EU  December 2019  20  The declared scope of the programme is the reduction of national vulnerabilities through the  promotion of cybersecurity higher education and research. There are currently 272 institutions  in the United States that are recognised as CAEs-CD. Regionally accredited 2-year, 4-year and  graduate-level institutions in the United States could become CAEs. These institutions are  formally recognised by the US government, but they do not receive direct funding from it. They  can apply for two different designations:   CAE in CD education (CAE-CDE) for associate, bachelors’, masters’ and doctoral  programmes,   CAE in CD research.  Depending on the level of the programme, organisations must meet different criteria. For  example, for a CAE-CDE bachelor’s, master’s, doctoral designation an organisation should  submit documentation covering the following (NSA-DHS, 2019):   support from the management of the institution;   delivery of a cyberdefence curriculum over the previous 3 years (25);   student skills development and assessment, detailing the courses required for the  development of scholarly skills, courses requiring laboratory exercises/hands-on assignments,  students’ participations in cybersecurity competitions and how the programme facilitates  interactions with cybersecurity practitioners;   the entity’s status as the main centre for cybersecurity education and practice, whose purpose  is to give guidance on CD information and be the focal point for collaboration and outreach  activities;   profile of cybersecurity faculty, with biographies and curricula vitae including academic  presentations, publications and support to students’ activities such as clubs and competitions;   how cybersecurity is taught in a multidisciplinary manner and how it is integrated into other  degree programmes within the academic institution;   if the institution has a security policy for the protection of its information systems;   how outreach and collaboration activities go beyond the institution and branch out to other  education institutions, the CAE community and industry.  Applications are reviewed by qualified cybersecurity professionals and subject matter experts  from CAE institutions, the government and the industry. If successful, an institution keeps the  designation for 5 years (NSA-CSS, 2019).  The CAE in cyber operations (CAE-CO) programme is complementary to the CAE-CD, with the  aim of supporting the National Initiative for Cybersecurity Education (NICE) and increasing the  pipeline of cybersecurity professionals. This programme has a strong foundation in computer  science, computer engineering and electrical engineering, and is particularly devoted to the  study of technologies and tools enabling cyber operations such as collection, exploitation and  response (NSA-CSS, 2019). At the time of writing, there are 21 CAE-CO designated institutions,  13 providing bachelors’ courses and 8 providing masters’ courses (26).  Institutions can apply for either the fundamental or the advanced programme. Requisites for the  fundamental programme include the following (27).   Academic content. The programme must include 100 % of the mandatory academic content  of the cybersecurity knowledge unit and 10 out of the 17 optional content units.  25 The curriculum must have courses mapped onto the list of foundational, core and optional cybersecurity knowledge units.  26 See https://www.nsa.gov/resources/students-educators/centers-academic-excellence/cae-co-centers/.  27 See https://www.nsa.gov/resources/students-educators/centers-academic-excellence/cae-co-advanced/.  https://www.nsa.gov/resources/students-educators/centers-academic-excellence/cae-co-centers/ https://www.nsa.gov/resources/students-educators/centers-academic-excellence/cae-co-advanced/  CYBERSECURITY SKILLS DEVELOPMENT IN THE EU  December 2019  21   Cyber operations recognition. The specialisation in cyber operations must be recognised  through a certificate.   Curricula review. A CAE-CO fundamental programme must have a strong foundation in  computer science, computer engineering or electrical engineering.   Cyber operations as an interdisciplinary science. The curriculum must expose students to  the policy, social, legal and ethical aspects of cyber operations and may include courses from  multiple colleges within a university as well as from multiple programmes and disciplines.   Robust and active cyber operations academic programme. The programme must provide  data on when cybersecurity operation courses were last taught.   Faculty and student involvement. Faculty and students should be involved in cyber  operations research.   Learning activities. Students ought to participate in clubs, cyber exercises and other  outreach activities to expand the cyber operations community.   Commitment to support the programme. There is commitment to support the CAE-CO  programme through the CAE-CO summer internship programme, and faculty participates in  knowledge exchange programmes.  4.5 CYBERSECURITY DEGREE CERTIFICATIONS: SUMMARY OF MAIN  FEATURES  Australia, France, the United Kingdom and the United States have set up schemes to certify  that national computer science degrees with a focus on cybersecurity, and cybersecurity  degrees, meet standards that their cybersecurity organisations have established. Although  processes and criteria differ, they also have several commonalities.  Not surprisingly, certification is awarded to degrees that provide an adequate amount of  taught courses and activities that are specific to cybersecurity. This is done to differentiate  courses that are in cybersecurity (or computer science degrees with a clear focus on  cybersecurity) from IT courses that could claim to provide some sort of cybersecurity education  but not enough to form well-rounded cybersecurity graduates.  Certification is typically awarded to those institutions that can show in great detail how  cybersecurity education is provided. For example, national authorities often inquire about the  structure of the curriculum and if more practical training is included. Moreover, a number of  certification processes ask directly about the kind of examinations students undergo, including  for example how students do their dissertations, what courses take place to increase students’  academic skills, how much time students spend on hands-on activities and if students are  encouraged to attend cybersecurity competitions. Finally, academic institutions often have to  declare whether or not the degree prepares students for a professional organisation.  A lot of importance is placed on the quality of the faculty, meaning that national authorities  request biographies and curricula vitae of lecturers. Academic institutions are often asked to  clarify the nature of the cybersecurity research that faculty is engaged in and if at least part of  the faculty has an industry background.  Degrees that have a broader interdisciplinary focus have more chance of being certified. For  example, topics that are not solely technical are strongly encouraged, such as legal courses on  data protection. Sometimes, even degrees that are not purely technical but have a predominant  organisational component can receive certification, although generally speaking the emphasis is  on teaching foundational engineering and computer science knowledge. In sum, cybersecurity  should be taught in a multidisciplinary manner and students should be exposed to a variety of  aspects of cybersecurity: policy, social, legal and ethical.  CYBERSECURITY SKILLS DEVELOPMENT IN THE EU  December 2019  22  National authorities place importance on external outreach activities and collaboration  opportunities that degrees have in place. From various education-to-labour market initiatives,  such as workplace training, business mentoring or internships and traineeships, to more  academic forms of collaborations with similar institutions, states seem to sponsor those degrees  that enhance and enrich a vigorous national cybersecurity ecosystem.  Finally, governments are interested in knowing about academic and employment outcomes.  Most notably, they seek to know how many students enrol each year, how many graduates a  course produces and possibly the types of jobs alumni end up securing after obtaining the degree.  CYBERSECURITY SKILLS DEVELOPMENT IN THE EU  December 2019  23  5. THE EU DIGITAL AND  CYBERSECURITY  EDUCATION POLICY &  ENISA’S HIGHER EDUCATION  DATABASE  This section details the activities that the European Commission and ENISA have put in place to  develop digital and cybersecurity education within the EU. In doing so, this section  contextualises ENISA’s work programme (ENISA, 2019) for supporting the EU Member States  in cybersecurity skill development (Output O.3.3.3) within a broader institutional and policy  framework. It also describes how the information collected in Sections 2 and 3 has been used to  inform the establishment of ENISA’s Cybersecurity Higher Education Database.  5.1 THE EU DIGITAL AND CYBERSECURITY EDUCATION POLICY  Interest in cybersecurity education and skills is of long standing within the EU and it has been a  policy concern since the publication by the European Commission of the first EU cybersecurity  strategy in 2013 (European Commission, High Representative of the European for Foreign  Affairs, & Policy, Cybersecurity Strategy of the European Union: An Open, Safe and Secure  Cyberspace, 2013). In the strategy document, the Commission invited Member States to  increase their education and training efforts around network and information security (NIS)  topics and to plan a ‘NIS driving licence’ as a voluntary certification programme to promote  enhanced skills and competence of IT professionals.  In the assessment of the EU 2013 cybersecurity strategy (28), the Commission reiterated that  ‘Awareness raising and skills development remain relevant Strategy objectives, for which  continuous efforts at both national and EU level are needed’.  This was considered urgent  especially in the light of the results of a public consultation, which listed skills development,  education and training of cybersecurity professionals among the top 5 challenges (in a list of 16)  for the future of EU cybersecurity.  In 2017, in the Joint Communication ‘Resilience, deterrence and defence: Building strong  cybersecurity for the EU’ (European Commission, High Representative of the European for  Foreign Affairs, & Policy, Resilience, Deterrence and Defence: Building strong cybersecurity for  the EU, 2017), the European Commission and the High Representative of the Union for Foreign  Affairs and Security Policy confirmed again that ‘there is a strong education dimension to  cybersecurity’ and that ‘effective cybersecurity relies heavily on the skills of the people  concerned’. They recommended that together with Member States, the EU should make a  contribution to enhance cybersecurity education and skills by building on the work of the Digital  Skills and Jobs Coalition, for example through the establishment of cybersecurity  apprenticeships for small and medium-sized enterprises, while action should be taken to  streamline cybersecurity into skills programmes, e-government and awareness campaigns.  The Joint Communication also called for the establishment of a European cybersecurity  industrial, technology and research competence centre and a network of national cybersecurity  28 See https://ec.europa.eu/transparency/regdoc/rep/other/SWD-2017-295-F1-EN-0-0.PDF (p. 34).  https://ec.europa.eu/transparency/regdoc/rep/other/SWD-2017-295-F1-EN-0-0.PDF  CYBERSECURITY SKILLS DEVELOPMENT IN THE EU  December 2019  24  coordination centres. The identifiied objective would be to help the EU retain and develop the  cybersecurity technological and industrial capabilities that are necessary to secure the digital  single market. According to the proposal, this initiative should provide input to policymakers  involved in increasing cybersecurity skills and help develop a qualified EU cybersecurity  workforce (European Commission, Proposal for a European Cybersecurity Competence  Network and Centre | Digital Single Market, 2019). In 2019, four pilot projects (29) —  CONCORDIA, ECHO, SPARTA and CyberSec4Europe — were launched to establish and  operate a pilot for a European cybersecurity competence network and to develop a common  European cybersecurity research and innovation roadmap. Among other goals, the four projects  will implement activities to increase training courses or programmes to tackle the CSSS in the  EU.  These activities have been complemented by the Digital Education Action Plan, which includes  ‘Cybersecurity in Education — Raising awareness of teachers and students’ (30) among the 11  actions to support the use of technology and the development of digital competences in  education. The Action Plan’s main tasks include an EU awareness campaign on cyberculture,  promoting basic cybersecurity practices among children, parents and educators, and a course  for educators to equip them with the pedagogical tools for teaching cybersecurity in primary and  secondary schools.  5.2 ENISA ROLE IN CYBERSECURITY EDUCATION  In this context, ENISA has been an active player in cybersecurity education, awareness and  research. Since 2012, the Agency has produced seven publications that are highly relevant to  the topic, ranging from broader NIS education roadmaps and public–private partnerships to  workforce development and the status of privacy and NIS curricula (31).  ENISA also helps organise the European Cyber Security Challenge (ECSC) (32). The ECSC is a  cybersecurity competition aimed at increasing talent across Europe and connecting highly  skilled individuals with leading industry organisations. The ECSC started in 2014, when three  national teams competed against each other in Fürstenfeld (Austria) on challenges with such  names as APT Network, Forensic Challenge, Java Hash Collisions, SQL Injections and Licence  Key Circumventions. After the first edition in 2014, more editions took place. The most recent  one took place in Bucharest in 2019 (33), where 20 teams and approximately 200 participants  from all over Europe tried to win cybersecurity challenges based on a curriculum developed by  experts from academia, industry and ENISA.  ENISA and the European Commission have also been running the European Cyber Security  Month (ECSM) (34) since 2012. The ECSM is an EU-wide awareness campaign fostering  cybersecurity knowledge among citizens by promoting education, sharing of good practices and  competitions in data and information security. The campaign targets both the general public but  also more specific groups such as IT experts, NIS authorities and academic organisations. The  2018 edition (35) registered new highs compared with the previous ones in terms of number of  activities (+ 6.5 %, from 532 to 567), social media followers (+ 28 %, from 12 894 to 16 500),  29 See https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/four-eu-pilot-projects-launched-prepare-european-cybersecurity- competence-network.  30 See https://ec.europa.eu/education/education-in-the-eu/european-education-area/digital-education-action-plan-action-7- cybersecurity-in-education_en.  31 These publications, which can be found at https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/cybersecurity-education?tab=publications,  are Network information security in education (2012), Collaborative solutions for network information security in education  (2012), Brokerage model for network and information security in education (2014), Public private partnerships in network  and information security education (2014), Roadmap for NIS education programmes in Europe (2014), Cybersecurity  education snapshot for workforce development in the EU (2015) and Status of privacy and NIS course curricula in EU  Member States (2015).  32 https://www.europeancybersecuritychallenge.eu/.  33 https://europeancybersecuritychallenge.eu/past-editions.  34 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/cybersecurity-education/european-cyber-security-month.  35 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/ecsm-2018-deployment-report/at_download/fullReport.  https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/four-eu-pilot-projects-launched-prepare-european-cybersecurity-competence-network https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/four-eu-pilot-projects-launched-prepare-european-cybersecurity-competence-network https://ec.europa.eu/education/education-in-the-eu/european-education-area/digital-education-action-plan-action-7-cybersecurity-in-education_en https://ec.europa.eu/education/education-in-the-eu/european-education-area/digital-education-action-plan-action-7-cybersecurity-in-education_en https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/cybersecurity-education?tab=publications https://www.europeancybersecuritychallenge.eu/ https://europeancybersecuritychallenge.eu/past-editions https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/cybersecurity-education/european-cyber-security-month https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/ecsm-2018-deployment-report/at_download/fullReport  CYBERSECURITY SKILLS DEVELOPMENT IN THE EU  December 2019  25  online reach (+ 4.6 %, from 86.5 million to 90.5 million) and publications mentioning the ECSM  (+ 400 %, from 330 to 1 655).  5.3 ENISA CYBERSECURITY HIGHER EDUCATION DATABASE  In this rather broad context, the present study tackles the policy challenge of the CSSS  (Section 2); considers what relevant stakeholders and experts have said about current  challenges in cybersecurity education and skills issues (Section 3); incorporates evidence from  national certification processes in Australia, France, the United Kingdom and the United States  (Section 4); and complements other activities in cybersecurity education and skills within the EU  (Section 5). In particular, this study aims to:  Promote a series of new activities in the area of cyber security skill development which will focus  on identifying current national and EU wide initiatives. The main output of this activity will be a  database of existing services and programs in the EU that aim to enhance cyber security skills  among EU citizens, in general, and cyber security experts, in particular. (ENISA, 2019)  To accomplish this task, ENISA is in the process of establishing the Cybersecurity Higher  Education Database. The Database is an updated version of the older Cybersecurity Education  Map, the two main novelties being a new user interface (an updated online map) and more  information on the cybersecurity degrees listed.  The Database aims to become the main point of reference for all citizens looking to upskill their  cybersecurity knowledge and skills. In essence, it is a list of cybersecurity degrees in EEA  countries and Switzerland. The database has basic filters that give essential information about  cybersecurity degrees, but also more advanced information that should allow citizens to make  more informed decisions about cybersecurity degrees (36).  Higher education institutions can add a degree in the Database if the degree is recognised by a  national authority of an EU or EFTA Member State and:   for a bachelor’s degree, at least 25 % of taught courses are on cybersecurity topics;   for a master’s degree, at least 40 % of taught courses are on cybersecurity topics;   for a PhD degree, students conduct research on a cybersecurity topic.  The term ‘cybersecurity topic’ refers to the topics in the knowledge areas of the Cybersecurity  Curricula 2017 developed by the Joint Task Force on Cybersecurity Education (Joint Task  Force on Cybersecurity Education, 2017). These knowledge areas are:   data security,   software security,   component security,   connection security,   system security,   human security,   organisational security,   societal security (37).  36 We recognise that professional certificates in a specific cybersecurity topic or field might be used as a solution to provide  specialised personnel able to respond to the immediate needs of the labour market. Hence, short-term solutions that  include collaboration between industry, professional certification bodies and academia might able to reduce limited  shortages of specific cybersecurity professionals. The Cybersecurity Higher Education Map does not at the moment include  professional certificates, but future iterations of the database might.  37 For a more detailed list of topics, please refer to Chapter 4 of Cybersecurity curricula 2017: Curriculum Guidelines for  Post-Secondary Degree Programs in Cybersecurity (https://www.acm.org/binaries/content/assets/education/curricula- recommendations/csec2017.pdf).  https://www.acm.org/binaries/content/assets/education/curricula-recommendations/csec2017.pdf https://www.acm.org/binaries/content/assets/education/curricula-recommendations/csec2017.pdf  CYBERSECURITY SKILLS DEVELOPMENT IN THE EU  December 2019  26  Higher education institutions will be invited to add relevant cybersecurity degrees and will be  asked to provide evidence of the taught cybersecurity courses that the degree offers. If a  degree does not offer the minimum required number of cybersecurity courses, it will be not be  included in the database. This is done to make sure the Database is relevant to people looking  for cybersecurity-specific degrees.  One of the main features of the new Cybersecurity Higher Education Database is the updated  information that it will contain about cybersecurity degrees. When universities enter their  degrees, they will be asked to provide standard mandatory information, including:   institution/university name,   degree/programme name,   type of degree/programme (bachelor’s, master’s or PhD),   delivery (classroom, online, blended, etc.),   language of instruction,   country and city,   degree’s online homepage/URL  They will have to answer the following questions as well.   Does the degree provide a specialisation in a particular cybersecurity topic?   Is the degree certified by a national cybersecurity authority following a formal certification  process?  Besides this standard information, however, higher education institutions will be encouraged to  provide more data. This information will be optional and therefore institutions will decide  whether or not to provide it. This optional information is meant to assist citizens even more in  finding and choosing the cybersecurity degree that best suits their needs. This additional  information is based on the relevant factors that emerged from the analyses in Sections 3 and 4  of this document (38). The optional information that may be added answers the following  questions.   Does the degree prepare students to undertake any professional certification?   Does the degree include a compulsory internship as a part of the degree programme?   Are there modules/lectures/units taught by professionals/specialists currently employed in the  industry?   What is the cost of tuition fees for EU citizens?   How many credits are included in the degree?   How many credits are in security computing or engineering topics (39)?   How many credits are in social science topics (40)?   How many credits are in organisational and managerial topics (41)?   How many female students graduated last year?   When was the degree established?  (38 Although some of this optional information is derived from the criteria that countries use to certify cybersecurity degrees,  the Database is not meant as a certification/accreditation process. The main difference between an application for national  certification and an application for inclusion in ENISA’s Database is that applications for national certification are reviewed  by a committee of national experts who evaluate the degree in accordance with a set of criteria. In contrast, an application  to be added to the map is not based on a qualitative assessment of the application; rather, ENISA will ensure that the  content provided respects the basic requirement (minimum percentage of taught cybersecurity courses depending on the  level of the degree) of the Database and that the additional information provided is truthful.  39 For example system security, network security, component security, data security and software security.  40 For example law, ethics, policy, privacy and criminology.  41 For example business, risk management and compliance.  CYBERSECURITY SKILLS DEVELOPMENT IN THE EU  December 2019  27  6. SUMMARY AND  RECOMMENDATIONS  This report started with an analysis of one of the most discussed issues in cybersecurity: the  skills shortage. Section 2 provided information on the worldwide shortage, and later zeroed in  on the situation in the EU, where nevertheless granular data are lacking compared with, for  example, Australia, the United Kingdom and the United States. Although the CSSS is  compounded by several factors, this report outlines four seemingly principal reasons. The first  two relate to the way employers (either public or private) recruit and value cyber security  professionals. Employers tend to look for professionals with years of experience, certifications  and relevant degrees, but these people are hard to find in this highly constrained labour market.  Because of this scarcity, employers should be probably both increasing their salaries to attract  more people into the sector and provide adequate training, but they seldom do. On the other  hand, there are two reasons why the education and training system could be also hold  responsible for the current labour market gridlock: it is not incentivizing enough students to join  cyber security-relevant degrees and seems unable to equip them with the right cyber security  knowledge and skills, which could give them better chances to become cyber security  professionals one day.  Summarising the views of the main stakeholders, Section 3 argues that most of the problems  that are beleaguering cybersecurity education and training — few cybersecurity courses in  computing curricula, poor alignment between educational offers and labour market demands,  little emphasis on multidisciplinary knowledge, and prominence of theory-based education  rather than hands-on training — revolve around the need to redefine educational and training  pathways to give a more unified standard on the knowledge and skills that students should  develop.  One way to do this is to bring major stakeholders to sit around a table and clearly define what  cybersecurity students ought to know and be able to do upon graduation and before entering  the labour market. To accomplish this, four states — Australia, France, the United Kingdom and  the United States — have established certification procedures to confirm that cybersecurity  degrees comply with the quality standards that national groups of experts have agreed upon.  Certification processes and requirements vary among these four states, but six major elements  are recurrent.  A certified higher education cybersecurity degree should have:   enough specific credits dedicated to cybersecurity courses and activities;   a structured curriculum, possibly including a practical/training component or specific  types of examinations and activities such as cybersecurity competitions;   a high-quality teaching faculty, which might include lecturers from the industry;   a broader multi-/interdisciplinary focus;   outreach activities and collaborations with the rest of the national cybersecurity  ecosystem;   information on academic and employment outcomes.  CYBERSECURITY SKILLS DEVELOPMENT IN THE EU  December 2019  28  In this context, ENISA created the Cybersecurity Higher Education Database to list  cybersecurity higher education degrees in EEA countries and Switzerland. The aim of the  Database is to become the premier source of information for citizens looking to upscale their  cybersecurity knowledge and skills by enrolling in a higher education degree course. The  Database is meant to help citizens navigate the growing cybersecurity educational offer and  help them make more informed decisions about the type of degree that is most suitable. The  information that institutions will provide to populate the Database is based on similar criteria to  those that countries use to certify national cybersecurity degrees. By creating a single and easy-  to-use online platform where citizens can find relevant information on cybersecurity degrees,  ENISA seeks to close potential information gaps — which arise, for example, when students  might be interested in a cybersecurity career but have no information on the best educational  pathways available — and bring cybersecurity supply and demand closer together.  6.1 CONSIDERATIONS  This report puts forward three main considerations.  a) When academia, employers and governments come together to determine what educational  and training experiences would be appropriate for cybersecurity, they recognise the  importance of achieving conceptual clarity on what it means to equip students with the right  cybersecurity knowledge and skills.  Clarifying this will help mitigate one factor that compounds the CSSS. This is also useful  because it better defines who should do what in developing the skills and knowledge of the  national cybersecurity workforce. This is especially true because employers should  recognise that higher education institutions are not necessarily meant to provide graduates  with the specific skills for a particular job; rather, they are intended to give students the  knowledge, skills and methods that will equip them to constantly engage with an evolving  threat scenario. As pointed out by Malan et al. (2018), cybersecurity should be seen as a  very technical subject requiring many years of experience. Therefore, even students who  obtain degrees that are highly relevant will need to develop their knowledge and skills further  once they leave the educational system, which implies that they must be provided with the  right opportunities for training. As Professor Steve Furnell puts it:  I think that care needs to be taken about how much we regard graduates as being directly  ‘qualified to work’ in the IT security field. Even as degree graduates, I would not necessarily  regard them as qualified practitioners. They should certainly have a good level of supporting  knowledge and some of the skills, but there will equally be various aspects that they have  not been able to put into practice ‘for real’ at that stage.(42)  Taking this into account, certification of cybersecurity degrees might be an important turning  point in a comprehensive cybersecurity workforce development strategy. This is because it  could clarify what knowledge and skills the education system is supposed to instil and,  consequently, what sort of training and further learning opportunities employers should  provide when students enter the workforce. In other words, cybersecurity degree certification  clarifies what education systems are supposed to achieve when training students, but also  defines the point at which employers should take over in continuing to develop the  workforce.  This recognises the fact that each stakeholder has a role in the formation and development  of skills of the national cybersecurity workforce. Because of the potential impact of  certification, it would be important to rigorously assess the expected outcomes. For  example, in the United Kingdom (Malan, Lale-Demoz, & Rampton, 2018) revealed that,  42 See https://media.kaspersky.com/uk/Kaspersky-Cyberskills-Report_UK.pdf  https://media.kaspersky.com/uk/Kaspersky-Cyberskills-Report_UK.pdf  CYBERSECURITY SKILLS DEVELOPMENT IN THE EU  December 2019  29  when students consider whether or not to apply for a degree in cybersecurity, they value the  ties between the academic institution and the industry — in the form of NCSC certification —  as important. Future research should further determine the benefits of certification for  students and employers and whether or not it effectively provides a more skilled workforce  and helps mitigate the CSSS.  b) However, determining what the right skills are is only a portion of a much wider problem that  is worsened by several other factors. This report concentrated on only one of the main  causes attributed to the CSSS. Although cybersecurity degree certification could be a step in  the right direction, it cannot be considered the only solution. In fact, some countries have  articulated cybersecurity education and skills strategies in which policies such as  certification are only one of several instruments.  The CSSS is both a qualitative and a quantitative issue, meaning that it should be tackled  along these two dimensions. Increasing the quality of cybersecurity graduates through  certified degrees is certainly useful to make cybersecurity job candidates more employable,  but this is not sufficient if the pipeline of professionals is not ample enough to guarantee that  vacancies are filled. For example, a national education system might be able to produce 100  quality candidates a year, but if the states needs 1 000 a year the shortage will persist.  Therefore, if states decide to implement strategies to cope with the CSSS, they must  differentiate between policies to increase the quality of candidates and those to increase  their number. For example, in the United Kingdom, in the 2016-17 academic year 79 905  students in higher education studied computer science, while 5 827 were enrolled in  cybersecurity courses (Malan, Lale-Demoz, & Rampton, 2018). This means that only 7 % of  students studying IT-related courses had a particular focus on security. Future research  should investigate whether or not policies could be able to incentivise large swaths of  students to enter educational pathways that would help create a self-sustained cybersecurity  workforce.  c) Moreover, scholars studying the intersection of education with the labour market have long  warned about the need to go beyond initiatives that target only the supply side of the  equation. (Mayhew & Keep, 2014). Incorporating policies to tackle issues that arise on the  demand side of the labour market, including deployment and ‘skill utilisation’, might be  beneficial (Buchanan, Finegold, Mayhew, & Warhurst, 2017). For example, Keep (Keep,  2017) argues that:  the alternative is to branch out and to adopt policies that see education and training as a  component within a much broader set of policies concerned with economic development,  business improvement, workplace innovation, productivity growth, and job quality.  There is plentiful evidence suggesting that the CSSS is affected by problems that are  generated on the demand side of the equation as well, namely when employers ask for  several years of professional experience and professional certification or are unwilling to  invest in human capital by providing training opportunities. Because of that, it would be  particularly promising to find solutions easing the transition from the education system into  the labour market and giving an active and systematic role to employers in developing the  cybersecurity workforce.  This does not seem to be an easy task and it probably requires further understanding of  what happens to cybersecurity graduates once they leave education. When a shortage  occurs, one would expect most cybersecurity students to quickly fill cybersecurity vacancies  as soon as they graduate. There is evidence suggesting otherwise. For example, one third  CYBERSECURITY SKILLS DEVELOPMENT IN THE EU  December 2019  30  of cybersecurity graduates in the United Kingdom go into positions that are unrelated to  cybersecurity (Malan, Lale-Demoz, & Rampton, 2018).  In the context of a shortage with potential implications for national security and economic  development, further research should thoroughly investigate the causes of such leakage.  Furthermore, easing the transition from the education system to the labour market is an  effort that probably requires a stronger and mature partnership between academia,  employers and the government. In this context, there seems to be an opportunity to study  how, perhaps after the adoption of certified cybersecurity degrees, employers might pledge  to increase the number of junior/entry-level opportunities and thus disrupt the bottlenecks  that are currently worsening the shortage.  6.2 RECOMMENDATIONS  In the light of this discussion, this report recommends further investigation of the following.  The impact of the certification of cybersecurity degrees on the CSSS. A rigorous and  systematic analysis of the implementation and outcomes of already established national  certification can give insights into potential best practices, which can be implemented in other  national contexts, after careful consideration of the characteristics of local education systems  and labour markets. For example, impact evaluations could compare certified cybersecurity  degrees with non-certified degrees and measure:   to what extent students improve their cybersecurity knowledge and skills;   to what extent certified degrees attract students who before enrolling are only marginally  interested in cybersecurity as a career opportunity;   the percentage of students landing a cybersecurity job, and the job’s role, sector, seniority and  wage level;   the time that students take to find a job after graduation;   the level of satisfaction of employers with graduates from certified cybersecurity programmes;   the level of satisfaction of educators with partnership with the industry;   the level of satisfaction of students with the degree;   other specific outcomes that certified programmes might produce, for example inclusion levels  of less represented segments of the population or increased collaboration with the national  cyber ecosystems.  The uptake and promotion of ENISA’s Cybersecurity Higher Education Database. The  Database will be a useful instrument for citizens only if it includes most, if not all, relevant  cybersecurity degrees in Europe. If the Database achieves this objective, it will also enable  further analysis of the evolving status of cybersecurity education in the EU. It will be in the best  interest of higher education institutions to proactively add their cybersecurity degrees to the  database, as this will be another way their educational offer can be further promoted and  publicised. In this context, it is important to find out:   what incentives are most likely to actively encourage higher education institutions to add their  degrees to the Database;   if the promotion of the Database in EU-wide awareness campaigns (such as the ECSM) could  be seen as a strong incentive;   how to make sure the Database becomes the premier source of information for citizens,  especially for students in secondary and tertiary education looking to continue the  development of their cybersecurity knowledge and skills with higher-level degrees.  CYBERSECURITY SKILLS DEVELOPMENT IN THE EU  December 2019  31  The nature and characteristics of the CSSS in the EU. This report aggregated the available  data to gain a better understanding of the CSSS, but also noted the lack of granular and  essential information on the shortage in the EU, especially in comparison with information  available in other countries. As the design of policies to mitigate the shortage should be  preceded by a detailed analysis of the problem, there are still too many gaps in our knowledge  of the EU CSSS that should be filled. For example, more research should answer current  practical concerns such as:   the number of vacancies that remain completely unfilled or stay open for longer than 3  months;   the depth of the cybersecurity market, represented by the ratio of the current cybersecurity  workforce to the number of cybersecurity vacancies;   the requirements in terms of years of professional experience, education and certification that  employers request, particularly for junior or mid-level cybersecurity jobs;   the median wage that EU cybersecurity professionals earn depending on their job role and  seniority level;   the job roles that are in highest demand, using already established frameworks (43);   the number of students who graduate with degrees that are directly relevant to a job in  cybersecurity;   the number of students with relevant cybersecurity degrees who do not end up in the  cybersecurity sector;   the potential effect of artificial intelligence and automation on the cybersecurity labour market.  Policy interventions are most effective in increasing the pipeline of professionals. To  make sure the shortage is addressed for what it is (a quantitative as well as a qualitative issue),  policy measures should ensure that more professionals come through the pipeline. Policies  such as degree certification most probably help to increase the quality of knowledge and skills,  but it is unclear to what extent they induce more people to join the sector. There are other  policies that have been deployed to increase career interest in cybersecurity, such as  competitions, challenges, career awareness campaigns and retraining programmes for  professionals already in the workforce. More should be known about:   the extent to which these programmes have been successful in achieving their outcomes;   whether or not they can be scaled up to meet current demand, especially in the light of what  seems to be a broader IT and STEM shortage.  Design of a comprehensive cybersecurity workforce development strategy. The design of  a comprehensive cybersecurity workforce development strategy that goes beyond policies  targeting only the education and training system. Instead, it should promote an active role for  employers in developing a national cybersecurity workforce. In this respect, ENISA can play a  role as a community builder and make sure all stakeholders’ needs are addressed in the  process. Although some governments have already designed quite comprehensive strategies to  deal with the shortage, most of the policy initiatives have been directed to spur changes in the  higher education system (44). Whereas these efforts have probably been necessary, more is  needed to create a virtuous cycle that guarantees a good match between workers’ supply and  labour market demands. Hence, employers should be fully integrated in the development of a  cybersecurity workforce and their role should be clarified.  43 For example the US National Initiative for Cybersecurity Education’s Cybersecurity Workforce Framework or the UK  Chartered Institute of Information Security Roles Framework.  44 For examples of these initiatives, see De Zan (2019).  CYBERSECURITY SKILLS DEVELOPMENT IN THE EU  December 2019  32  In particular, it should be investigated:   what policies can ease the transition from the education system to the labour market and  promote skill utilisation in cybersecurity;   to what extent employers can smooth current labour market bottlenecks by offering more  entry-level opportunities for graduates;   what kind of training schemes and other workplace innovation policies best facilitate the entry  and retention of cybersecurity employees;   to what extent employers should be responsible for training from scratch (and paying for it)  individuals with no cybersecurity relevant backgrounds if the education and training system is  unable to produce enough cybersecurity graduates.

    "abstract": "This report focuses on the status of the cybersecurity education system and the inability to attract more students in studying cybersecurity and to produce graduates with “the right cybersecurity knowledge and skills”. It argues that many of the current issues in cybersecurity education could be lessened by redesigning educational and training pathways that define knowledge and skills which students should possess upon graduation and after entering the labour market. Four countries – Australia, France, the United Kingdom and the United States – have attempted to rethink cybersecurity degrees using certifications. In this context, ENISA created the Cybersecurity Higher Education Database, which is an interactive database of cybersecurity degrees in EEA countries and Switzerland."

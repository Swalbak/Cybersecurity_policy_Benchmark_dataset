The objectives of the Conference were:  a) to exchange good practices in the field of international cyber-crisis cooperation and cyber  exercises;  b) to bring together the stakeholders that organise and have experience in cyber-crisis  cooperation and cyber exercises in order to enable/enhance cooperation between them;  and  c) to identify gaps and challenges in the field of international cyber-crisis cooperation and in  cyber exercises.  The Second ENISA International Conference on Cyber-Crisis Cooperation and Exercises was a  unique high-profile international event that aimed to directly support the new cyber security  strategy2 of the European Union by helping various constituents in their efforts to establish a more  coherent cyber security policy. Additionally, the conference was a key knowledge sharing platform  for national and governmental level cyber security experts. It also facilitated debate and information  exchange, and offered networking opportunities to both technical experts and executive  stakeholders.  The event presented an excellent opportunity for the participants to share thoughts, opinions and  expertise in the field of cyber-crisis cooperation, focusing on topics such as:  1. Cyber security and crisis management exercises  2. National NIS incident management and cooperation plans  3. Alerting systems and information exchange platforms for cross-border NIS cooperation  4. Integrated situational awareness. Data collection, abstraction, visualisation  5. Governance models, practices and escalation procedures for cyber-crisis management  6. International NIS cooperation for incident management and response  7. Legal aspects of NIS cooperation and information sharing  8. Handling public relations and media in the case of major cyber-incidents  9. Breach notification / regulatory affairs: ENISA as the reporting point for the Member States  10. Cooperation procedures involving civilian and national security stakeholders  The conference achieved its objectives and succeeded in creating an open and collaborative  platform for sharing experience and insights between the 120+ participants. Moreover, leveraging  on the success of the Second ENISA International Conference on Cyber-Crisis Cooperation and  Exercises, the Agency aims to continue organise follow-up actions and is considering a third such  conference in the years to come.  1  More information is available at: http://www.enisa.europa.eu/c3e/conference  2  See also the EU Cybersecurity plan to protect open internet and online freedom and opportunity – Cyberecurity strategy and Proposal  for a Directive available at http://ec.europa.eu/digital-agenda/en/news/eu-cybersecurity-plan-protect-open-internet-and-online-freedom- and-opportunity-cyber-security  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/c3e/conference http://ec.europa.eu/digital-agenda/en/news/eu-cybersecurity-plan-protect-open-internet-and-online-freedom-and-opportunity-cyber-security http://ec.europa.eu/digital-agenda/en/news/eu-cybersecurity-plan-protect-open-internet-and-online-freedom-and-opportunity-cyber-security  Report on the Second International Conference on Cyber-crisis Cooperation and Exercises  September 2013  Page 2  2 Agenda  The conference speeches were grouped under nine major themes.

The speaker gave a summary of the relevant  work of ENISA and the European Commission in the field of cyber-crisis cooperation and cyber  exercises. He also gave an overview of the key elements of the European Union’s Cyber Security  Strategy and its overall relevance for the Member States’ economy and society.  The conference included eight sessions. Below we summarise the key messages, the insights and the  comments by the speakers, the panellists and the audience during these sessions.  4.1 Governance models, practices and cooperation procedures for cyber- crisis management  The first session of the conference introduced a set of viewpoints on cooperation models during a  large-scale cyber-crisis. The lessons learned from prior cyber-crisis exercises indicate that a valuable  governance model for the crisis management activities is a well-established and effectively  implemented formal advisory board in which the stakeholders should work together closely during  a cyber-crisis.  Information sharing and analysis within such a formal advisory board provides better strategic  guidance during the mitigation phase of the crisis, shaping the decision-making process. A crucial  point highlighted during the discussions was that such a group should encompass various fields of  expertise and should also be constantly ‘nurtured’ via informal meetings and exercises.  A presentation on existing activities for developing crisis cooperation frameworks at EU level  emphasised the need for a layered approach. The European Cyber-Crisis Cooperation Framework  (ECCCF) is a strong procedural triple-layer framework for cooperation between EU public  organisations – supporting the Member States’ needs. The ECCCF defines generic crisis management  functions for each of the following three layers:   technical,   operational, and   strategic/political.  In particular, the technical layer of the ECCCF provides for the key assumption that although there is  still room for improvement, the cooperation and information exchange procedures in place between  national structures involved, e.g., Computer Emergency Response Teams (CERTs) are robust. It has  been determined that CERTs have long-standing information exchange channels or at least  understandings that work sufficiently well for them to know how to pass to one another the relevant  and actionable information, especially in the case of a large-scale cyber-incidents.  At the operational level the EU cyber community is still in the capability-building phase. The recent  pan-European cyber exercises4 indicate that this community should focus on: the threat analysis,  situational assessment and mitigation action measures. Cyber security agencies, CERTs, IT ministries,  regulators, communications authorities, etc., will all need to increase their efforts in adopting in  their daily work the EU Standard Operational Procedures (SOP), written by and for EU cyber security  crisis managers. These provide a set of good practices to improve information exchange and  3  Note that this report is not a full summary of all presentations. The latter are available to download at the  website of the event: www.enisa.europa.eu/ccce-conference  4  Visit: www.enisa.europa.eu/c3e  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/ccce-conference http://www.enisa.europa.eu/c3e  Report on the Second International Conference on Cyber-crisis Cooperation and Exercises  September 2013  Page 6  cooperation at operational level between countries during multinational cyber-crises, in order to  speed up the understanding of their causes and the mitigation of their impacts.  From an EU perspective it is relevant to highlight that at the strategic/political level there are  already existing European crisis management procedures, namely the EU integrated political crisis  response arrangements (formerly known as crisis coordination agreements). Although they do not  explicitly cover cyber-crises, these crisis management procedures are generic enough to meet any  crisis, including cyber. On the other hand, it is acknowledged that the existence of cooperation  frameworks and mechanisms does not by itself ensure positive cyber-crisis outcomes. The pan-  European cyber exercise, Cyber Europe 2014, will focus on exploring the crisis cooperation  mechanisms of all layers.  The first theme of the ENISA conference also gave insights into the preparedness response to the  cyber security challenges from the United States perspective. An interesting insight was provided  into actions undertaken by NIST in order to work with the relevant stakeholders for jointly  developing a voluntary framework for reducing cyber risks to critical infrastructure – in response to  the national US policy reflected by the US Executive Order 13636 on improving critical infrastructure  cyber security.  This US voluntary cyber security framework is being developed in an open manner with input from  stakeholders in industry, academia and government, including a public review and comment  process, workshops, and other means of engagement. The cyber security framework is intended to  be leveraged by organisations looking to establish or improve a cybersecurity programme, to  communicate cyber security requirements with stakeholders and/or to identify gaps.  All the above viewpoints were complemented by the European Commission’s views and initiatives  reflected in the European Cyber Security Strategy and in the draft Directive on Network and  Information Security.  The session also revealed the importance of public–private partnerships when it comes to  responding effectively to cyber-crises. An excellent example is the partnership in the Netherlands  that has proved useful both during real cyber-crisis incidents, and also before such incidents through  its risk assessment and mitigation measures.  4.2 Cyber-crisis management and cooperation exercises  The second session of the conference stressed the importance of having the right expectations set  prior to performing cyber-crisis exercises. Techniques used by cyber adversaries are continuously  evolving – techniques which incorporate innovative elements, starting from the use of popular  websites for information gathering, steganography 5  and aggressive identity theft techniques,  combined with the use of massive resources, both technical and human.  Several lessons learnt from real-life cases were presented, illustrating the value of cyber intelligence  sharing with private industry and national CERTs as well as the usefulness of information sharing  platforms and information exchange standards.  The presenters also highlighted the importance of cross-layer cooperation, for instance linking the  policymakers to technical people and vice versa, in particular during national cyber exercises. A  popular view amongst the conference participants was that nation-wide cyber-crisis management  5  A general term to describe techniques for hiding messages within otherwise legitimate/normal ones.  Report on the Second International Conference on Cyber-crisis Cooperation and Exercises  September 2013  Page 7  and cooperation exercises are key in strengthening society’s ability to manage national IT-related  crises, primarily by developing the capability for public and private actors to cooperate and  coordinate with one another.  Key characteristics of the cyber-crisis management and cooperation exercises were emphasised by  the speakers. Depending on the amount of effort invested by organisations, such exercises can  provide ‘pressured’ situations as close to reality as one would feel during a crisis. Setting such  ambitious goals requires persistence and continuous improvement.  The main acknowledged benefits of the exercises could be summarised as follows:   Enhancement of participants’ capability in analysing consequences and response measures   Obtaining an increased knowledge of ‘available’ resources for cyber-crisis management   Preparation of alternative platforms for communication in case of a large-scale cyber-crisis  or threat   Creation of the opportunity to immediately update cyber-preparedness policies, plans and  processes.  Since a cyber-crisis situation can only be resolved by cooperation and information sharing, special  emphasis was placed on the mutual benefits achieved by the participants in multinational and  multilevel cyber exercises in terms of ensuring preparedness. However, it was acknowledged that  despite good preparation and collaborative approaches, such exercises may not always reach their  objective to initiate real information sharing and multinational collaboration between participating  nations. Expectations of such collaboration should be realistic and well balanced with the actual  level of contribution from each party involved.  4.3 Governance models, practices and cooperation procedures for general  crisis management  The third session of the conference brought to the audience the key lessons learned from crisis  management and cooperation in domains that are significantly different from the cyber security  domain. The session made obvious to all the many conceptual similarities in crisis management in  classic areas such as public health, disease prevention and control, aviation and air traffic  management. One particular example is the early warning and response system and intelligence  information systems used for disease prevention and control in order to ensure cooperation and  adequate management of crises. Inspirational examples of how the public health threats are  detected and reported and on how (rapid) risk assessments are undertaken can be further  extrapolated for the cyber security domain. It is clear that the story of one industry’s challenges and  how it overcame the adversities and applied the lessons learned can often be conceptually ‘cloned’  to the cyber security domain too.  Another practical example of a crisis management and coordination mechanism that is  comprehensive in nature (covering a cyber dimension too) came from the aviation sector, air traffic  management in particular. In this example, the key actors involved have clearly acknowledged the  high relevance of the cyber-crisis elements, and supported the execution of a specific cyber exercise  (codenamed ‘Cyber13’ cyber security exercise) in order to effectively test the governance models,  practices and cooperation procedures. Amongst the key lessons learned, we highlight the following:   Reporting lines on cyber issues need to be clarified   Development and use of crisis management support tools is essential in order to ensure  effective cooperation  Report on the Second International Conference on Cyber-crisis Cooperation and Exercises  September 2013  Page 8   Crisis management procedures should be kept flexible, so out-of-the box solutions can  emerge   Country-level points of contact (Focal Points) should play a key role in the coordination and  communication during major cyber events, involving national-level cyber security expertise,  in addition to the EU-level one.  The recently established European Cyber Crime Centre (EC3) that is operational within Europol has a  key role in fighting cyber-crime. The discussion focused on the benefits of tackling in a coordinated  manner the collateral significant threats of ever-increasing cyber criminality.  These examples emphasise that – in line with the prior experience of other sectors – building an  effective cyber-crisis management community is an intensive, sustained and time-consuming  process, which takes time to mature. The advantage, though, is that cyber-crisis management  communities can learn a lot from more traditional crisis management experiences in other areas.  4.4 Cyber-exercise scenarios: supply chain integrity  The session closing the first conference day provided insights into the good practices used in the  private sector to appropriately safeguard the integrity of the supply chain, in particular within the  telecommunications and information technology sectors.  In today’s global economy, almost all technology products depend on global supply chains. As the  dependence on ICT technologies increases in all areas of life and work, concerns have been  expressed about the integrity of diverse international supply chains. Standards bodies have  responded to these concerns by developing standards addressing various aspects of supply chain  integrity. Moreover, organisations in various industry segments have developed best practices to  deal with international suppliers and global supply chains.  The good practice approaches and concepts applied in the traditional supply chain integrity can be  also adapted to the cyber domain as well. A key prerequisite is that there is a need for a coordinated  general framework that unifies these ideas, as well as for more efforts from the standards bodies  and industry associations.  Various types of crises that may impact the supply chains were illustrated, including (specifically)  cyber-crises – with a view that preparedness, availability of resources and development of  capabilities are key for successfully overcoming them.  Another interesting topic was the need to find the right balance between an open- versus closed-  source model of approach in the supply chain (technology and software, in particular). There is a  clear need for a framework to support a trusted supply chain for software and technology  components that have relevance to, for example, critical (ICT) infrastructures, governments, and  public services.  4.5 Issues in cyber security crisis management, cooperation and information  exchange  During the fifth session the conference participants had the opportunity to learn about the cyber  security situation in parts of the Asia-Pacific region. It showed that cyber-attacks can be motivated  by cultural and political influences and agendas. Details were shared with the audience on certain  patterns observed in the mechanisms by which these massive cyber-attacks emerge.  Report on the Second International Conference on Cyber-crisis Cooperation and Exercises  September 2013  Page 9  A set of interesting observations and correlations emerged from the monitoring and analysis of  several relevant cyber-attacks noted in the Asia-Pacific region, as for example:   It is relatively difficult to grasp activity trends using automatic monitoring tools;   Sharing cyber-attack tools has become an extremely common trend, therefore the impact of  simultaneous attacks by users without extensive knowledge or skills about cyber-attacks has  increased significantly;   Some Asia-Pacific countries, such as Japan, are mainly focused on building framework and  strengthening the systems. The focus is on ‘protection’ rather than on ‘response’.  A key catalyst of the cyber security management and information exchange process is adequate  cyber-incident reporting. Such reporting, carried out after the incident has been resolved, helps us  understand threats, vulnerabilities and the impact of incidents. Therefore, there is a strong opinion  that incident reporting is vital to improve risk assessment, and to allow industry and government to  improve cyber security.  During this session, ENISA gave an overview of the different types of incident reporting legislation in  the EU and facilitated a discussion with the audience on how to set up an efficient and effective  framework of incident reporting across Europe. Finally, there was a discussion of the impact of  European legislation translated into actual measures – ENISA provided highlights on the security  processes and information flows of the Telecom reform in Article 13a.6 Of high relevance here was  the information on the reporting tools available.  4.6 Technical issues in cyber-crisis cooperation and exercises  This session provided insight into the increasing professionalisation of technical cyber exercises and  the possibility of gaining experience through ‘lessons learned’. Examples included the competitive  element of the Locked Shields competition, and the cyber security drills for the energy sector in  Qatar. This also indicated that both developed and emerging economies are faced with the same set  of cyber threat categories and each has to find its own measures in order to safeguard both national  and trading interests.  One of the conclusions during the session was that one key success factor in good preparation of the  national or regional cyber exercises is ample training and prior preparation. Another key success  factor is a strong incentive to organise and participate in sectoral, national or regional cyber  exercises where the ‘nobody is left behind’ principle prevails. Transparency, realistic participant  expectations, mutual respect and active contribution to the exercises are other key elements.  An interesting presentation and analysis was made on the series of Distributed Denial of Service  (DDoS) attacks targeting web services in the Czech Republic in March 2013. The series of cyber-  attacks were well prepared in terms of planning, selection of the targets, good order of the targets,  volume of the attacks and methods used for attacks. Despite the challenge raised by the attacks  themselves, this situation was very enlightening for the Czech Republic and its Internet community –  lessons were learned, technical information exchanged and the cyber-crisis cooperation mechanisms  were further strengthened at national level. The presentation gave an overview of the attack and  what type of solution and defence mechanisms were used to mitigate it. The participants were also  informed about the process of information sharing and assessment and on the role and actions of  existing Czech CERT/CSIRT teams during the attacks at national and international levels. The positive  6  See: http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2009:337:0037:0069:EN:PDF and  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/Incidents-reporting  http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2009:337:0037:0069:EN:PDF https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/Incidents-reporting  Report on the Second International Conference on Cyber-crisis Cooperation and Exercises  September 2013  Page 10  and also negative outcomes from this situation were presented, including key observations and  changes made as a result of this event in the Czech Republic.  The importance of cyber-crisis exercises like Cyber Europe 2012 was highlighted as extremely  valuable in enabling those concerned to respond effectively during the major incident in the Czech  Republic.  4.7 Infrastructures related to cyber-crisis cooperation and exercises  The seventh session of the conference demonstrated the ever-increasing complexity of cyber  security and the importance of infrastructures and professional training of cyber security experts –  with the participants noting that the solid knowledge and skills of these experts represent a key  asset. It was predicted that in the next decade skilled and competent cyber defence personnel will  be a scarce and expensive resource – both in Europe and worldwide. In this context, it is relevant to  highlight that the Defence part of the EU cyber security strategy emphasises awareness, skills and  training.  The European Defence Agency (EDA) recently concluded a holistic landscaping study on Cyber  Defence capabilities, taking into account what exists in Member States and EU institutions both on  the civil and the military side. This study provided the impetus to pursue several work strands,  including cyber defence training and awareness to improve cyber resilience of future operations.  EDA’s presentation addressed training-related findings of its stocktaking study and gave insights on  current training, exercises and awareness activities.  Complementing these views, but still in the same area of the cyber knowledge and skills as a  fundamental ‘infrastructure’ asset, ENISA gave the participants a fresh overview of the on-going  initiatives with regard to technical training for CERTs. Emphasis was placed on the need for a variety  of types of training to respond to different requirements including legal, operational, technical and  cooperation aspects for CERTs. The key success factor for such training is that it must be specifically  tailored to fulfil the needs of this specific audience.  A fresh insight was presented by the European Commission on the Testa New Generation (Testa NG)  communication platform that aims to support the exchange of electronic data between European  and Member States’ administrations in a secure, reliable and efficient way. The need and  expectation for additional security levels and services that should be on top of the current network  security architecture was a main driver for Testa NG.  A key challenge mentioned for the further roll-out of secure infrastructures (of the magnitude of  Testa NG) relates to the legal requirements with regard to the handling of EU Classified Information  (EUCI) within EU Member States, third countries and international organisations.  Report on the Second International Conference on Cyber-crisis Cooperation and Exercises  September 2013  Page 11  4.8 Challenges and approaches of cyber risk assessments  The final session of the conference concentrated on  illustrating the key trends and practices for  preparing National Risk Assessments (NRA) in the  context of the lifecycle of National Contingency  Plans (NCPs). 7  Such activities are aimed at  identifying risks and assessing the impacts of  potential incidents. As an overall contextual  element, it is relevant to mention that in the  Cybersecurity Strategy for the EU and the  accompanied proposed NIS Directive 8  the  European Commission specifically call for the  development of national contingency plans (see for  example Article 5 of the proposed NIS Directive)  and for regular exercises testing large-scale  networks’ security incident response and disaster  recovery, as a step towards closer pan-European  coordination.  ENISA has carried out extensive work on national  plans relevant to cyber security, and highlighted a  number of interesting aspects and inspirational  examples related to the applied national-level methodologies. For instance, the fact that most  countries use scenario-based approaches where actors are gathered together to consider threat  scenarios and impacts, or that most of the approaches to the conduct of an NRA are based on a  decentralised model where each actor prepares their own risk assessment to be integrated by a  coordinating authority.  Challenges noted were presented too, in particular:   The lack of a harmonised national framework for cyber security, particularly terminology   The incomplete and diverse risk assessment methodologies used   Lack of comprehensive methods to address identified cyber threats   Need for effective risk management and preparedness capacity and skills   Need to establish and share a catalogue of scenarios to help the EU Member States in their  NRAs.  In this context, it was recommended that there should be greater exchange of knowledge about risk  analysis expertise with other domains that assess complex cross-border risks, such as border security  financial services or public health, and to further facilitate access to EU scientific expertise on NRA.  An EU Member State presented insights on the steps taken towards a National Cyber Risk  Assessment, revealing that this exercise helped in the identification and prioritisation of critical  7  See the ENISA 2011, study on National Contingency Plans www.enisa.europa.eu/c3e/nis-cooperation-plans  8 ‘Cybersecurity Strategy of the European Union: An Open, Safe and Secure Cyberspace - JOIN(2013) 1 final -  7/2/2013’ and ‘Proposal for a Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council concerning measures to  ensure a high common level of network and information security across the Union - COM(2013) 48 final -  7/2/2013’.

Moreover, it provided valuable input to several national cyber security strategy  actions and complemented the national risk assessments in other areas.  Another interesting viewpoint was also presented from an US perspective – where the speaker  highlighted the need to overcome legal barriers before rolling out best practices on cyber risk  assessments from the governmental to private sector. This example also showed that the size of the  country and the relative number of actors involved is not important when it comes to having a  strong resolve to face the cyber security conundrum.  In 2013, ENISA will release an analysis of the existing practices in the area of National Risk  Assessment. This document will be the basis of a pilot programme which will support Member States  in developing comprehensive risk assessment capabilities. Similar activities have supported EU  Member States in their efforts to set up National Contingency Plans for CIIP.  5 Main conclusions  In this section we summarise the high-level conclusions9 of the conference, based on the presenters’  opinions, the presentations and feedback from the audience. These high-level findings will further  support and enhance cyber-crisis management and cooperation in Europe.   The international community in cyber-crisis management, cooperation and exercises should  be supported further through the provision of similar opportunities to ENISA’s series of  International Conferences. In addition to the discussions sparked by the presentations made  by the different speakers, such an event provides for excellent networking opportunities.  These types of networks are of paramount importance for effective cross-border cyber-crisis  cooperation.   Cyber-crisis exercises provide an excellent way to test and maintain cooperation  procedures, plans and structures for dealing with large-scale crises. Ideas and knowledge in  this area should be exchanged as far as possible and efforts should be aligned with each  other, at national and international levels. Such exercises should be complemented with  technical cyber security training that focuses mainly on skills development.   There is a strong call for better cooperation within and between public and private sectors  as the challenges faced by both private and public are strikingly similar. Not only should  cooperation be an initiative worth pursuing, but best practices of both sides ought to be  shared and learned from.   It was noted that there are numerous public initiatives that perhaps should align in terms  of objectives and activities, prior to linking up with both private enterprises and solutions.   It is essential to have the right people at the table who can speak a common language.  Technical experts and policymakers should meet in a neutral environment and find a way to  talk a common language to bridge any differences and work out constructive solutions.   The important decision on full disclosure to the public in the event of a crisis (and the  potential counter-productive reaction of the public as well as giving the attackers tactical  9  The order of this list does not suggest any priority in the activities to be undertaken.  Report on the Second International Conference on Cyber-crisis Cooperation and Exercises  September 2013  Page 13  knowledge on the progress of the defensive side) versus covert cooperation remains a  balancing act. Many difficulties and intricacies make a one-size-fits-all solution impossible.  The stakeholders seemed to agree that every organisation should make this decision for  itself in order to find the right fit.   There should be a balance between the focus on building cyber capabilities versus the focus  on building a framework and strengthening the system. Both the ‘Protect’ and the ‘Respond’  strategies may be equally valid.   There is an expectation to create a security accreditation scheme of infrastructure elements  (supporting cyber cooperation), while it is acknowledged that accrediting such networks is  neither necessary nor sufficient for building trust.   In the next decade skilled and competent cyber personnel will be a scarce and expensive  resource – both in Europe and worldwide. The ever-increasing complexity of cyber security  emphasises the importance of professional training of cyber security experts. Technical  cyber security exercises will help in this area.   Public–private partnerships to develop valid scenarios and assess their impact on services  and infrastructures are the recommended way forward to perform national-level risk  assessments, depending on the specifics of each country. The actors involved should not  hesitate to seek guidance and obtain good practices from other countries or European  organisations.  5.1 Recommendations for future Conferences  Below are some recommendations for the future conferences on Cyber-Crisis Cooperation and  Exercises:   Future events should move in the direction of focusing on specific topics in the area of  Cyber-Crisis Cooperation and Exercises. The focus could be associated with the location of  the event. For example, a future conference hosted in a non-EU country could focus on  international cooperation on exercises.   The private sector should have a clear stand in the future conferences, focusing on their role  in cyber-crisis cooperation but also on potential threats and scenarios for exercises in the  private sector.   Partnerships should be sought for future events. For example, synergies with other  established events, collaboration with and sponsorships from the public and private sector  stakeholders, etc.  Report on the Second International Conference on Cyber-crisis Cooperation and Exercises  September 2013  Page 14  Report on the Second International Conference on Cyber-crisis Cooperation and Exercises  September 2013  Page 15  PO Box 1309, 710 01 Heraklion, Greece  Tel: +30 28 14 40 9710  info@enisa.europa.eu  www.enisa.europa.eu  ENISA  European Union Agency for Network and Information Security  Science and Technology Park of Crete (ITE)  Vassilika Vouton, 700 13, Heraklion, Greece  Athens Office  1 Vasilisis Sofias  151 24, Marousi, Athens, Greece  doi: 10.2824/2584",

The objectives of the Conference were:  a) to exchange good practices in the field of international cyber-crisis cooperation and cyber  exercises;  b) to bring together the stakeholders that organise and have experience in cyber-crisis  cooperation and cyber exercises in order to enable/enhance cooperation between them;  and  c) to identify gaps and challenges in the field of international cyber-crisis cooperation and in  cyber exercises.  The Second ENISA International Conference on Cyber-Crisis Cooperation and Exercises was a  unique high-profile international event that aimed to directly support the new cyber security  strategy2 of the European Union by helping various constituents in their efforts to establish a more  coherent cyber security policy. Additionally, the conference was a key knowledge sharing platform  for national and governmental level cyber security experts. It also facilitated debate and information  exchange, and offered networking opportunities to both technical experts and executive  stakeholders.  The event presented an excellent opportunity for the participants to share thoughts, opinions and  expertise in the field of cyber-crisis cooperation, focusing on topics such as:  1. Cyber security and crisis management exercises  2. National NIS incident management and cooperation plans  3. Alerting systems and information exchange platforms for cross-border NIS cooperation  4. Integrated situational awareness. Data collection, abstraction, visualisation  5. Governance models, practices and escalation procedures for cyber-crisis management  6. International NIS cooperation for incident management and response  7. Legal aspects of NIS cooperation and information sharing  8. Handling public relations and media in the case of major cyber-incidents  9. Breach notification / regulatory affairs: ENISA as the reporting point for the Member States  10. Cooperation procedures involving civilian and national security stakeholders  The conference achieved its objectives and succeeded in creating an open and collaborative  platform for sharing experience and insights between the 120+ participants. Moreover, leveraging  on the success of the Second ENISA International Conference on Cyber-Crisis Cooperation and  Exercises, the Agency aims to continue organise follow-up actions and is considering a third such  conference in the years to come.  1  More information is available at: http://www.enisa.europa.eu/c3e/conference  2  See also the EU Cybersecurity plan to protect open internet and online freedom and opportunity – Cyberecurity strategy and Proposal  for a Directive available at http://ec.europa.eu/digital-agenda/en/news/eu-cybersecurity-plan-protect-open-internet-and-online-freedom- and-opportunity-cyber-security  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/c3e/conference http://ec.europa.eu/digital-agenda/en/news/eu-cybersecurity-plan-protect-open-internet-and-online-freedom-and-opportunity-cyber-security http://ec.europa.eu/digital-agenda/en/news/eu-cybersecurity-plan-protect-open-internet-and-online-freedom-and-opportunity-cyber-security  Report on the Second International Conference on Cyber-crisis Cooperation and Exercises  September 2013  Page 2  2 Agenda  The conference speeches were grouped under nine major themes.

The speaker gave a summary of the relevant  work of ENISA and the European Commission in the field of cyber-crisis cooperation and cyber  exercises. He also gave an overview of the key elements of the European Union’s Cyber Security  Strategy and its overall relevance for the Member States’ economy and society.  The conference included eight sessions. Below we summarise the key messages, the insights and the  comments by the speakers, the panellists and the audience during these sessions.  4.1 Governance models, practices and cooperation procedures for cyber- crisis management  The first session of the conference introduced a set of viewpoints on cooperation models during a  large-scale cyber-crisis. The lessons learned from prior cyber-crisis exercises indicate that a valuable  governance model for the crisis management activities is a well-established and effectively  implemented formal advisory board in which the stakeholders should work together closely during  a cyber-crisis.  Information sharing and analysis within such a formal advisory board provides better strategic  guidance during the mitigation phase of the crisis, shaping the decision-making process. A crucial  point highlighted during the discussions was that such a group should encompass various fields of  expertise and should also be constantly ‘nurtured’ via informal meetings and exercises.  A presentation on existing activities for developing crisis cooperation frameworks at EU level  emphasised the need for a layered approach. The European Cyber-Crisis Cooperation Framework  (ECCCF) is a strong procedural triple-layer framework for cooperation between EU public  organisations – supporting the Member States’ needs. The ECCCF defines generic crisis management  functions for each of the following three layers:   technical,   operational, and   strategic/political.  In particular, the technical layer of the ECCCF provides for the key assumption that although there is  still room for improvement, the cooperation and information exchange procedures in place between  national structures involved, e.g., Computer Emergency Response Teams (CERTs) are robust. It has  been determined that CERTs have long-standing information exchange channels or at least  understandings that work sufficiently well for them to know how to pass to one another the relevant  and actionable information, especially in the case of a large-scale cyber-incidents.  At the operational level the EU cyber community is still in the capability-building phase. The recent  pan-European cyber exercises4 indicate that this community should focus on: the threat analysis,  situational assessment and mitigation action measures. Cyber security agencies, CERTs, IT ministries,  regulators, communications authorities, etc., will all need to increase their efforts in adopting in  their daily work the EU Standard Operational Procedures (SOP), written by and for EU cyber security  crisis managers. These provide a set of good practices to improve information exchange and  3  Note that this report is not a full summary of all presentations. The latter are available to download at the  website of the event: www.enisa.europa.eu/ccce-conference  4  Visit: www.enisa.europa.eu/c3e  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/ccce-conference http://www.enisa.europa.eu/c3e  Report on the Second International Conference on Cyber-crisis Cooperation and Exercises  September 2013  Page 6  cooperation at operational level between countries during multinational cyber-crises, in order to  speed up the understanding of their causes and the mitigation of their impacts.  From an EU perspective it is relevant to highlight that at the strategic/political level there are  already existing European crisis management procedures, namely the EU integrated political crisis  response arrangements (formerly known as crisis coordination agreements). Although they do not  explicitly cover cyber-crises, these crisis management procedures are generic enough to meet any  crisis, including cyber. On the other hand, it is acknowledged that the existence of cooperation  frameworks and mechanisms does not by itself ensure positive cyber-crisis outcomes. The pan-  European cyber exercise, Cyber Europe 2014, will focus on exploring the crisis cooperation  mechanisms of all layers.  The first theme of the ENISA conference also gave insights into the preparedness response to the  cyber security challenges from the United States perspective. An interesting insight was provided  into actions undertaken by NIST in order to work with the relevant stakeholders for jointly  developing a voluntary framework for reducing cyber risks to critical infrastructure – in response to  the national US policy reflected by the US Executive Order 13636 on improving critical infrastructure  cyber security.  This US voluntary cyber security framework is being developed in an open manner with input from  stakeholders in industry, academia and government, including a public review and comment  process, workshops, and other means of engagement. The cyber security framework is intended to  be leveraged by organisations looking to establish or improve a cybersecurity programme, to  communicate cyber security requirements with stakeholders and/or to identify gaps.  All the above viewpoints were complemented by the European Commission’s views and initiatives  reflected in the European Cyber Security Strategy and in the draft Directive on Network and  Information Security.  The session also revealed the importance of public–private partnerships when it comes to  responding effectively to cyber-crises. An excellent example is the partnership in the Netherlands  that has proved useful both during real cyber-crisis incidents, and also before such incidents through  its risk assessment and mitigation measures.  4.2 Cyber-crisis management and cooperation exercises  The second session of the conference stressed the importance of having the right expectations set  prior to performing cyber-crisis exercises. Techniques used by cyber adversaries are continuously  evolving – techniques which incorporate innovative elements, starting from the use of popular  websites for information gathering, steganography 5  and aggressive identity theft techniques,  combined with the use of massive resources, both technical and human.  Several lessons learnt from real-life cases were presented, illustrating the value of cyber intelligence  sharing with private industry and national CERTs as well as the usefulness of information sharing  platforms and information exchange standards.  The presenters also highlighted the importance of cross-layer cooperation, for instance linking the  policymakers to technical people and vice versa, in particular during national cyber exercises. A  popular view amongst the conference participants was that nation-wide cyber-crisis management  5  A general term to describe techniques for hiding messages within otherwise legitimate/normal ones.  Report on the Second International Conference on Cyber-crisis Cooperation and Exercises  September 2013  Page 7  and cooperation exercises are key in strengthening society’s ability to manage national IT-related  crises, primarily by developing the capability for public and private actors to cooperate and  coordinate with one another.  Key characteristics of the cyber-crisis management and cooperation exercises were emphasised by  the speakers. Depending on the amount of effort invested by organisations, such exercises can  provide ‘pressured’ situations as close to reality as one would feel during a crisis. Setting such  ambitious goals requires persistence and continuous improvement.  The main acknowledged benefits of the exercises could be summarised as follows:   Enhancement of participants’ capability in analysing consequences and response measures   Obtaining an increased knowledge of ‘available’ resources for cyber-crisis management   Preparation of alternative platforms for communication in case of a large-scale cyber-crisis  or threat   Creation of the opportunity to immediately update cyber-preparedness policies, plans and  processes.  Since a cyber-crisis situation can only be resolved by cooperation and information sharing, special  emphasis was placed on the mutual benefits achieved by the participants in multinational and  multilevel cyber exercises in terms of ensuring preparedness. However, it was acknowledged that  despite good preparation and collaborative approaches, such exercises may not always reach their  objective to initiate real information sharing and multinational collaboration between participating  nations. Expectations of such collaboration should be realistic and well balanced with the actual  level of contribution from each party involved.  4.3 Governance models, practices and cooperation procedures for general  crisis management  The third session of the conference brought to the audience the key lessons learned from crisis  management and cooperation in domains that are significantly different from the cyber security  domain. The session made obvious to all the many conceptual similarities in crisis management in  classic areas such as public health, disease prevention and control, aviation and air traffic  management. One particular example is the early warning and response system and intelligence  information systems used for disease prevention and control in order to ensure cooperation and  adequate management of crises. Inspirational examples of how the public health threats are  detected and reported and on how (rapid) risk assessments are undertaken can be further  extrapolated for the cyber security domain. It is clear that the story of one industry’s challenges and  how it overcame the adversities and applied the lessons learned can often be conceptually ‘cloned’  to the cyber security domain too.  Another practical example of a crisis management and coordination mechanism that is  comprehensive in nature (covering a cyber dimension too) came from the aviation sector, air traffic  management in particular. In this example, the key actors involved have clearly acknowledged the  high relevance of the cyber-crisis elements, and supported the execution of a specific cyber exercise  (codenamed ‘Cyber13’ cyber security exercise) in order to effectively test the governance models,  practices and cooperation procedures. Amongst the key lessons learned, we highlight the following:   Reporting lines on cyber issues need to be clarified   Development and use of crisis management support tools is essential in order to ensure  effective cooperation  Report on the Second International Conference on Cyber-crisis Cooperation and Exercises  September 2013  Page 8   Crisis management procedures should be kept flexible, so out-of-the box solutions can  emerge   Country-level points of contact (Focal Points) should play a key role in the coordination and  communication during major cyber events, involving national-level cyber security expertise,  in addition to the EU-level one.  The recently established European Cyber Crime Centre (EC3) that is operational within Europol has a  key role in fighting cyber-crime. The discussion focused on the benefits of tackling in a coordinated  manner the collateral significant threats of ever-increasing cyber criminality.  These examples emphasise that – in line with the prior experience of other sectors – building an  effective cyber-crisis management community is an intensive, sustained and time-consuming  process, which takes time to mature. The advantage, though, is that cyber-crisis management  communities can learn a lot from more traditional crisis management experiences in other areas.  4.4 Cyber-exercise scenarios: supply chain integrity  The session closing the first conference day provided insights into the good practices used in the  private sector to appropriately safeguard the integrity of the supply chain, in particular within the  telecommunications and information technology sectors.  In today’s global economy, almost all technology products depend on global supply chains. As the  dependence on ICT technologies increases in all areas of life and work, concerns have been  expressed about the integrity of diverse international supply chains. Standards bodies have  responded to these concerns by developing standards addressing various aspects of supply chain  integrity. Moreover, organisations in various industry segments have developed best practices to  deal with international suppliers and global supply chains.  The good practice approaches and concepts applied in the traditional supply chain integrity can be  also adapted to the cyber domain as well. A key prerequisite is that there is a need for a coordinated  general framework that unifies these ideas, as well as for more efforts from the standards bodies  and industry associations.  Various types of crises that may impact the supply chains were illustrated, including (specifically)  cyber-crises – with a view that preparedness, availability of resources and development of  capabilities are key for successfully overcoming them.  Another interesting topic was the need to find the right balance between an open- versus closed-  source model of approach in the supply chain (technology and software, in particular). There is a  clear need for a framework to support a trusted supply chain for software and technology  components that have relevance to, for example, critical (ICT) infrastructures, governments, and  public services.  4.5 Issues in cyber security crisis management, cooperation and information  exchange  During the fifth session the conference participants had the opportunity to learn about the cyber  security situation in parts of the Asia-Pacific region. It showed that cyber-attacks can be motivated  by cultural and political influences and agendas. Details were shared with the audience on certain  patterns observed in the mechanisms by which these massive cyber-attacks emerge.  Report on the Second International Conference on Cyber-crisis Cooperation and Exercises  September 2013  Page 9  A set of interesting observations and correlations emerged from the monitoring and analysis of  several relevant cyber-attacks noted in the Asia-Pacific region, as for example:   It is relatively difficult to grasp activity trends using automatic monitoring tools;   Sharing cyber-attack tools has become an extremely common trend, therefore the impact of  simultaneous attacks by users without extensive knowledge or skills about cyber-attacks has  increased significantly;   Some Asia-Pacific countries, such as Japan, are mainly focused on building framework and  strengthening the systems. The focus is on ‘protection’ rather than on ‘response’.  A key catalyst of the cyber security management and information exchange process is adequate  cyber-incident reporting. Such reporting, carried out after the incident has been resolved, helps us  understand threats, vulnerabilities and the impact of incidents. Therefore, there is a strong opinion  that incident reporting is vital to improve risk assessment, and to allow industry and government to  improve cyber security.  During this session, ENISA gave an overview of the different types of incident reporting legislation in  the EU and facilitated a discussion with the audience on how to set up an efficient and effective  framework of incident reporting across Europe. Finally, there was a discussion of the impact of  European legislation translated into actual measures – ENISA provided highlights on the security  processes and information flows of the Telecom reform in Article 13a.6 Of high relevance here was  the information on the reporting tools available.  4.6 Technical issues in cyber-crisis cooperation and exercises  This session provided insight into the increasing professionalisation of technical cyber exercises and  the possibility of gaining experience through ‘lessons learned’. Examples included the competitive  element of the Locked Shields competition, and the cyber security drills for the energy sector in  Qatar. This also indicated that both developed and emerging economies are faced with the same set  of cyber threat categories and each has to find its own measures in order to safeguard both national  and trading interests.  One of the conclusions during the session was that one key success factor in good preparation of the  national or regional cyber exercises is ample training and prior preparation. Another key success  factor is a strong incentive to organise and participate in sectoral, national or regional cyber  exercises where the ‘nobody is left behind’ principle prevails. Transparency, realistic participant  expectations, mutual respect and active contribution to the exercises are other key elements.  An interesting presentation and analysis was made on the series of Distributed Denial of Service  (DDoS) attacks targeting web services in the Czech Republic in March 2013. The series of cyber-  attacks were well prepared in terms of planning, selection of the targets, good order of the targets,  volume of the attacks and methods used for attacks. Despite the challenge raised by the attacks  themselves, this situation was very enlightening for the Czech Republic and its Internet community –  lessons were learned, technical information exchanged and the cyber-crisis cooperation mechanisms  were further strengthened at national level. The presentation gave an overview of the attack and  what type of solution and defence mechanisms were used to mitigate it. The participants were also  informed about the process of information sharing and assessment and on the role and actions of  existing Czech CERT/CSIRT teams during the attacks at national and international levels. The positive  6  See: http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2009:337:0037:0069:EN:PDF and  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/Incidents-reporting  http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2009:337:0037:0069:EN:PDF https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/Incidents-reporting  Report on the Second International Conference on Cyber-crisis Cooperation and Exercises  September 2013  Page 10  and also negative outcomes from this situation were presented, including key observations and  changes made as a result of this event in the Czech Republic.  The importance of cyber-crisis exercises like Cyber Europe 2012 was highlighted as extremely  valuable in enabling those concerned to respond effectively during the major incident in the Czech  Republic.  4.7 Infrastructures related to cyber-crisis cooperation and exercises  The seventh session of the conference demonstrated the ever-increasing complexity of cyber  security and the importance of infrastructures and professional training of cyber security experts –  with the participants noting that the solid knowledge and skills of these experts represent a key  asset. It was predicted that in the next decade skilled and competent cyber defence personnel will  be a scarce and expensive resource – both in Europe and worldwide. In this context, it is relevant to  highlight that the Defence part of the EU cyber security strategy emphasises awareness, skills and  training.  The European Defence Agency (EDA) recently concluded a holistic landscaping study on Cyber  Defence capabilities, taking into account what exists in Member States and EU institutions both on  the civil and the military side. This study provided the impetus to pursue several work strands,  including cyber defence training and awareness to improve cyber resilience of future operations.  EDA’s presentation addressed training-related findings of its stocktaking study and gave insights on  current training, exercises and awareness activities.  Complementing these views, but still in the same area of the cyber knowledge and skills as a  fundamental ‘infrastructure’ asset, ENISA gave the participants a fresh overview of the on-going  initiatives with regard to technical training for CERTs. Emphasis was placed on the need for a variety  of types of training to respond to different requirements including legal, operational, technical and  cooperation aspects for CERTs. The key success factor for such training is that it must be specifically  tailored to fulfil the needs of this specific audience.  A fresh insight was presented by the European Commission on the Testa New Generation (Testa NG)  communication platform that aims to support the exchange of electronic data between European  and Member States’ administrations in a secure, reliable and efficient way. The need and  expectation for additional security levels and services that should be on top of the current network  security architecture was a main driver for Testa NG.  A key challenge mentioned for the further roll-out of secure infrastructures (of the magnitude of  Testa NG) relates to the legal requirements with regard to the handling of EU Classified Information  (EUCI) within EU Member States, third countries and international organisations.  Report on the Second International Conference on Cyber-crisis Cooperation and Exercises  September 2013  Page 11  4.8 Challenges and approaches of cyber risk assessments  The final session of the conference concentrated on  illustrating the key trends and practices for  preparing National Risk Assessments (NRA) in the  context of the lifecycle of National Contingency  Plans (NCPs). 7  Such activities are aimed at  identifying risks and assessing the impacts of  potential incidents. As an overall contextual  element, it is relevant to mention that in the  Cybersecurity Strategy for the EU and the  accompanied proposed NIS Directive 8  the  European Commission specifically call for the  development of national contingency plans (see for  example Article 5 of the proposed NIS Directive)  and for regular exercises testing large-scale  networks’ security incident response and disaster  recovery, as a step towards closer pan-European  coordination.  ENISA has carried out extensive work on national  plans relevant to cyber security, and highlighted a  number of interesting aspects and inspirational  examples related to the applied national-level methodologies. For instance, the fact that most  countries use scenario-based approaches where actors are gathered together to consider threat  scenarios and impacts, or that most of the approaches to the conduct of an NRA are based on a  decentralised model where each actor prepares their own risk assessment to be integrated by a  coordinating authority.  Challenges noted were presented too, in particular:   The lack of a harmonised national framework for cyber security, particularly terminology   The incomplete and diverse risk assessment methodologies used   Lack of comprehensive methods to address identified cyber threats   Need for effective risk management and preparedness capacity and skills   Need to establish and share a catalogue of scenarios to help the EU Member States in their  NRAs.  In this context, it was recommended that there should be greater exchange of knowledge about risk  analysis expertise with other domains that assess complex cross-border risks, such as border security  financial services or public health, and to further facilitate access to EU scientific expertise on NRA.  An EU Member State presented insights on the steps taken towards a National Cyber Risk  Assessment, revealing that this exercise helped in the identification and prioritisation of critical  7  See the ENISA 2011, study on National Contingency Plans www.enisa.europa.eu/c3e/nis-cooperation-plans  8 ‘Cybersecurity Strategy of the European Union: An Open, Safe and Secure Cyberspace - JOIN(2013) 1 final -  7/2/2013’ and ‘Proposal for a Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council concerning measures to  ensure a high common level of network and information security across the Union - COM(2013) 48 final -  7/2/2013’.

Moreover, it provided valuable input to several national cyber security strategy  actions and complemented the national risk assessments in other areas.  Another interesting viewpoint was also presented from an US perspective – where the speaker  highlighted the need to overcome legal barriers before rolling out best practices on cyber risk  assessments from the governmental to private sector. This example also showed that the size of the  country and the relative number of actors involved is not important when it comes to having a  strong resolve to face the cyber security conundrum.  In 2013, ENISA will release an analysis of the existing practices in the area of National Risk  Assessment. This document will be the basis of a pilot programme which will support Member States  in developing comprehensive risk assessment capabilities. Similar activities have supported EU  Member States in their efforts to set up National Contingency Plans for CIIP.  5 Main conclusions  In this section we summarise the high-level conclusions9 of the conference, based on the presenters’  opinions, the presentations and feedback from the audience. These high-level findings will further  support and enhance cyber-crisis management and cooperation in Europe.   The international community in cyber-crisis management, cooperation and exercises should  be supported further through the provision of similar opportunities to ENISA’s series of  International Conferences. In addition to the discussions sparked by the presentations made  by the different speakers, such an event provides for excellent networking opportunities.  These types of networks are of paramount importance for effective cross-border cyber-crisis  cooperation.   Cyber-crisis exercises provide an excellent way to test and maintain cooperation  procedures, plans and structures for dealing with large-scale crises. Ideas and knowledge in  this area should be exchanged as far as possible and efforts should be aligned with each  other, at national and international levels. Such exercises should be complemented with  technical cyber security training that focuses mainly on skills development.   There is a strong call for better cooperation within and between public and private sectors  as the challenges faced by both private and public are strikingly similar. Not only should  cooperation be an initiative worth pursuing, but best practices of both sides ought to be  shared and learned from.   It was noted that there are numerous public initiatives that perhaps should align in terms  of objectives and activities, prior to linking up with both private enterprises and solutions.   It is essential to have the right people at the table who can speak a common language.  Technical experts and policymakers should meet in a neutral environment and find a way to  talk a common language to bridge any differences and work out constructive solutions.   The important decision on full disclosure to the public in the event of a crisis (and the  potential counter-productive reaction of the public as well as giving the attackers tactical  9  The order of this list does not suggest any priority in the activities to be undertaken.  Report on the Second International Conference on Cyber-crisis Cooperation and Exercises  September 2013  Page 13  knowledge on the progress of the defensive side) versus covert cooperation remains a  balancing act. Many difficulties and intricacies make a one-size-fits-all solution impossible.  The stakeholders seemed to agree that every organisation should make this decision for  itself in order to find the right fit.   There should be a balance between the focus on building cyber capabilities versus the focus  on building a framework and strengthening the system. Both the ‘Protect’ and the ‘Respond’  strategies may be equally valid.   There is an expectation to create a security accreditation scheme of infrastructure elements  (supporting cyber cooperation), while it is acknowledged that accrediting such networks is  neither necessary nor sufficient for building trust.   In the next decade skilled and competent cyber personnel will be a scarce and expensive  resource – both in Europe and worldwide. The ever-increasing complexity of cyber security  emphasises the importance of professional training of cyber security experts. Technical  cyber security exercises will help in this area.   Public–private partnerships to develop valid scenarios and assess their impact on services  and infrastructures are the recommended way forward to perform national-level risk  assessments, depending on the specifics of each country. The actors involved should not  hesitate to seek guidance and obtain good practices from other countries or European  organisations.  5.1 Recommendations for future Conferences  Below are some recommendations for the future conferences on Cyber-Crisis Cooperation and  Exercises:   Future events should move in the direction of focusing on specific topics in the area of  Cyber-Crisis Cooperation and Exercises. The focus could be associated with the location of  the event. For example, a future conference hosted in a non-EU country could focus on  international cooperation on exercises.   The private sector should have a clear stand in the future conferences, focusing on their role  in cyber-crisis cooperation but also on potential threats and scenarios for exercises in the  private sector.   Partnerships should be sought for future events. For example, synergies with other  established events, collaboration with and sponsorships from the public and private sector  stakeholders, etc.  Report on the Second International Conference on Cyber-crisis Cooperation and Exercises  September 2013  Page 14  Report on the Second International Conference on Cyber-crisis Cooperation and Exercises  September 2013  Page 15  PO Box 1309, 710 01 Heraklion, Greece  Tel: +30 28 14 40 9710  info@enisa.europa.eu  www.enisa.europa.eu  ENISA  European Union Agency for Network and Information Security  Science and Technology Park of Crete (ITE)  Vassilika Vouton, 700 13, Heraklion, Greece  Athens Office  1 Vasilisis Sofias  151 24, Marousi, Athens, Greece  doi: 10.2824/2584",

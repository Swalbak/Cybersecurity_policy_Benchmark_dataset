Collaboration between  Computer Security Incident Response Teams (CSIRTs) and Law Enforcement Agencies (LEAs) is key for  finding such information and for fighting against cybercrime.  A number of attacks that recently hit critical sectors brought an increased level of cooperation, partly out  of necessity, Wannacry (ENISA, 2017a) and ‘NotPetya’ (an updated version of Petya) attacks (Europol,  2017a) being the most recent examples. The legal and organisational aspects are an important component  for the cooperation.  This report aims to support the cooperation between CSIRTs - in particular national/governmental CSIRTs -  and LEAs in their fight against cybercrime, by providing information on the legal and organisational  aspects, identifying current shortcomings, and formulating and proposing recommendations on legal and  organisational aspects to further enhance the cooperation.  The data for this report was collected via desk research, interviews with subject-matter experts, and an  online survey.  The data collected confirmed that CSIRTs and LEAs often exchange information during the incident  handling/investigations, both formally and informally, and that trust is the key success factor for the  cooperation. However, it is clear that there are challenges related to the variety of legal systems and legal  provisions in the different Member States. Adding further complexity is the diversity of communication  channels between the various Member States that represents an issue in terms of the effectiveness to  fight crime.  Core recommendations to improve legal and organisational aspects of the cooperation in particular  between national/governmental CSIRTs and LEAs include:   CSIRTs and LEAs should place liaison officers on both ends and ENISA should propose ways to  facilitate the liaison officers’ coordination;   CSIRTs and LEAs, with the support of ENISA and Europol’s EC3, should formalise intelligence exchange;   CSIRTs and LEAs should adopt and use simplified standardised forms for data requests and simplified  standardised procedures for their information sharing;   National/governmental CSIRTs and national law enforcement training centres, with the support of  ENISA and Europol’s EC3, should further invest in CSIRT-LEA training and skills development;   Member States, ENISA and Europol’s EC3 should further invest in networking events and trust- relationships between CSIRTs and LEAs;   ENISA should analyse the implementation of the NIS Directive and the application of GDPR focusing  on successes as well as challenges to ensure that shortcomings are addressed;   Member States should clearly identify which information CSIRTs and LEAs are allowed/obliged to  share between them under the current legal framework;   Member States should have in place legislation that well define under which conditions CSIRTs and  LEAs are allowed/obliged to share and accountability when they share, as well as reflect on turning  information sharing between (national) CSIRTs and LEAs mandatory;  Improving Cooperation between CSIRTs and Law Enforcement: Legal and Organisational Aspects  Version 1.0  |  November 2017  08   Member States, with the support of ENISA, should promote a culture of information sharing between  CSIRTs and LEAs within the country and cross-border;   Member States, ENISA and Europol’s EC3, should promote the improvement of maturity of LEAs and  CSIRTs in order to better facilitate the information exchange;   CSIRTs and LEAs should develop internal security policies permitting and supporting information  sharing with CSIRT/LEAs counterpart;   CSIRTs, with the support of ENISA and Europol’s EC3, should make available and LEAs take advantage  of CSIRTs dataset, expertise and contacts.  In parallel to this report, ENISA has published a complementary report on Tools and Methodologies to  Support Cooperation between CSIRTs and Law Enforcement (ENISA, 2017), which focuses on technical  aspects and which is available on the ENISA website.  Improving Cooperation between CSIRTs and Law Enforcement: Legal and Organisational Aspects  Version 1.0  |  November 2017  09  1. Introduction  Purpose  The purpose of this report on Improving Cooperation between CSIRTs and Law Enforcement: Legal and  Organisational Aspects is to understand the legal and organisational aspects of the cooperation between  Computer Security Incident Response Teams (CSIRTs) and Law Enforcement Agencies (LEAs), including of  their communication.  While this report focuses on the legal and organisational aspects, some considerations are also made  about the technical aspects. However, the technical aspects of this cooperation are addressed in more  detail in the ENISA report on Tools and Methodologies to Support Cooperation between CSIRTs and Law  Enforcement (ENISA, 2017).  Background of the Report  The ENISA Programming Document 2017-2019 (ENISA, 2017b) includes “Objective 4.2. - CSIRT and NIS  community building”. Under Objective 4.2, “Output 4.2.1 - Support the fight against cybercrime and  collaboration between CSIRTs and LEA” has the goal to “to build upon the progress ENISA has made in  supporting different operational communities (e.g. CSIRT, law enforcement, European FI-ISAC) to enhance  mutually satisfactory ways to collaborate and support good practices among different stakeholders in  operational communities in Europe” (ENISA, 2017b, p. 52).  This report contributes to the implementation of Output 4.2.1, in particular to what is foreseen as “Further  improvement of communication between CSIRTs and LEA (based on 2011 report ‘Flair for Sharing’)”  (ENISA, 2011a).  Report Objectives and Scope  Report Objectives  The main objectives of this report are to:   Provide information on legal and organisational aspects of the cooperation between CSIRTs - especially  national/governmental CSIRTs - and LEAs, in particular of their communication;   Identify current1 challenges - mainly legal and organisational ones - that CSIRTs and LEAs face in their  cooperation to fight against cybercrime;   Formulate and propose recommendations to enhance mutually satisfactory ways of cooperation,  including communication, within the current legal framework and to further improve, if needed, the  legal framework for the cooperation and the organisational aspects of it.  Report Scope  The geographical coverage of this report is limited to the EU (European Union, 2017) and EFTA (EFTA, n.d.)2  countries. This does not mean however that all these countries are covered in the report and that no  reference to other countries outside EU and EFTA is made therein.  1 Cut-off date for this report: 1 November 2017.  2 In this report “n.d.” stands for “no date” and it is used in the references when no date could be found for the cited  source.  Improving Cooperation between CSIRTs and Law Enforcement: Legal and Organisational Aspects  Version 1.0  |  November 2017  10  The report does not target a specific sector; considerations made can apply to cooperation between CSIRTs  and LEAs to fight against cybercrime in all sectors (from finance to energy, from transport to health).  The area of the fight against terrorism is outside the scope of this report, although many of the developed  considerations can be extended to it.  Concerning CSIRTs, the report focuses in particular on national/governmental ones.  Target Audience  The intended target audience are CSIRTs - mainly national/governmental CSIRTs but not limited to them -,  LEAs, and in general public and private organisations with an interest in NIS.  Additionally, policy and law makers may benefit from select aspects of analysis as well as  recommendations of this report, as they prepare policies and legislation for the purpose of enhancing the  cooperation between the two important communities in fighting cybercrime, being CSIRTs and LEAs.  Key Concepts and Definitions  In the context of this report, the following definitions – below listed in alphabetical order – apply:   Challenge refers to “a situation that poses difficulties, a situation where one or more than one  obstacle is present and need to be overcome/removed, and where determination is required” (Portesi,  2008). In this report challenges – as well as the aspects of the cooperation - are grouped in “legal”,  “organisational” and “technical”.   Classification (of events or incidents) “is designed to group related things together and to define the  relationship these things have to each other [… (ENISA, 2011b)]. In addition, classification is the  repartition of events and incidents into classes, not to be confused with the level of classification of a  document [… (ENISA, 2015a)]” (ENISA, 2016a, p. 59).   Communication in most cases refers to the information sharing between CSIRTs and LEAs. Sometimes  the term “communication” is also used in its legal sense of “policy document with no mandatory  authority” (European Judicial Network, n.d.), such as the Commission Communication on  Strengthening Europe's Cyber Resilience System (European Commission, 2016). In a few cases it refers  to the transmitted information or – especially when in plural – to a system used to transmit the  information. Communication is an essential component of the cooperation between CSIRTs and LEAs.   Computer Security Incident Response Team (CSIRT) or Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT)  is “an organisation that studies computer and network security in order to provide incident response  services to victims of attacks, publish alerts concerning vulnerabilities and threats, and […] offer other  information to help improve computer and network security”. At present, “both terms (CERT and  CSIRT) are used in a synonymous manner, with CSIRT being the more precise term” (ENISA, 2015b, p.  7) (ENISA, 2015a, p. 12) (ENISA, 2016b, p. 10).   Cooperation and collaboration here are synonymous in this document. They refer to the joint work of  CSIRTs and LEAs, their coordination of actions, their reciprocal help and their joining efforts to fight  against cybercrime.   Criminal investigations “refers to the investigatory phase beginning with a police officer becoming  aware of the fact that criminal activity is going to be committed or has been committed and it ends  when the case is solved” (Portesi, 2008, p. 109) and/or closed.   Cybercrime is an umbrella term. An unequivocal definition of cybercrime does not exist. In general we  refer by it to “Any offense where the modus operandi or signature [which refers to “the mental and  emotional motivations” (Geberth, 1995)] involves the use of a computer network in any way” (Casey,  2004, p. 667). Cybercrime includes both crimes where computer is an object (e.g. illegal access to an  information system) or a tool (e.g. storage of illegal images on a computer device or usage of a  Improving Cooperation between CSIRTs and Law Enforcement: Legal and Organisational Aspects  Version 1.0  |  November 2017  11  computer to plan a murder) of crime. It must be noted that “While many aspects of cybercrime are  firmly established, other areas of cybercrime have witnessed a striking upsurge in activity, including  attacks on an unprecedented scale, as cybercrime continues to take new forms and new directions”  (Europol, 2017).   Governmental CSIRTs are teams whose constituency are the public administration networks. Currently  “in the EU, governmental CSIRTs are typically used to protect the cyberspace of governmental  institutions including critical infrastructure as well as to ensure cyber-crisis management” (ENISA,  2015c, p. 9).   Information sharing refers to “the exchange of a variety of network and information security related  information such as risks, vulnerabilities, threats and internal security issues as well as good practice”  (ENISA, 2010, p. 9).   Incident is “any event having an actual adverse effect on the security of network and information  systems” (European Parliament and Council of the European Union, 2016a).   Incident handling refers to “all procedures supporting the detection, analysis and containment of an  incident and the response thereto” (European Parliament and Council of the European Union, 2016a).   Law enforcement and Law Enforcement Agencies (LEAs) are terms used in this report as synonymous  and they refer to “agencies responsible for maintaining public order and enforcing the law, particularly  the activities of prevention, detection, and investigation of crime and the apprehension of criminals”  (BJS, n.d.)   Legal aspects refer to the dimensions of the CSIRT-LEA cooperation that relate to the rules and policies  shaping and governing it, including obligations, discretion, prohibition to share information in their  effort to fight against cybercrime.   Malware Information Sharing Platform (MISP) is an “Open Source Threat Intelligence Platform &  Open Standards for Threat Information Sharing” (MISP, 2017) and it is “a combination of a community  of members, a knowledge base on malware and a web-based platform” (NATO NCI Agency).   Methodology is a term used in this report with two main meanings. First, in its meaning in research, it  refers to which kind of data are collected (e.g. qualitative or quantitative) and how (i.e. methods of  data collection; see for example Chapter 2 - Methodology). Second, in the sense of ways how CSIRTs  and LEAs share information in their joint effort to fight against cybercrime.   National CSIRT: a CSIRT that “acts as national point of contact (PoC) for information sharing (like  incident reports, vulnerability information and other) with other national […] CSIRTs in the EU Member  States and worldwide. National […] CSIRT can be considered as “CERT of last resort”, which is just  another definition of a unique national PoC with a coordinating role. In a lot of cases a national […]  CSIRTs also acts as governmental […] CSIRT. Definitions may vary across the EU Member States”  (ENISA, 2009, p. 8).   National cyber security strategy or national strategy on the security of network and information  systems refers to the “framework providing strategic objectives and priorities on the security of  network and information systems at national level” (European Parliament and Council of the European  Union, 2016a).   Network and information system refers to “(a) an electronic communications network […]; (b) any  device or group of interconnected or related devices, one or more of which, pursuant to a program,  perform automatic processing of digital data; or (c) digital data stored, processed, retrieved or  transmitted by elements covered under points (a) and (b) for the purposes of their operation, use,  protection and maintenance” (European Parliament and Council of the European Union, 2016a).   Organisational aspects refer to those dimensions of the CSIRT-LEA cooperation that relate to steps  taken, procedures followed, resources available, etc. in their cooperation to fight against cybercrime.   Practices refers to “something that is usually or regularly done, often as a habit, tradition, or custom”  (Cambridge University Press, n.d.).  http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/regularly http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/habit http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/tradition http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/custom  Improving Cooperation between CSIRTs and Law Enforcement: Legal and Organisational Aspects  Version 1.0  |  November 2017  12   Standard: in a very broad sense means refers to something normally used or widely accepted. “In  simple terms, a standard is a document that provides rules or guidelines to achieve order in a given  context” (ETSI, n.d.). “Standards are produced for many different products and services, and may be  created for company, national, regional or global application. They may be used on a voluntary basis,  or made mandatory by company policy, national or international regulation, or by law.  In Europe there are three different categories of standard:   international standard – a standard adopted by an international standardisation organisation   European standard – a standard adopted by a European standardisation body   national standard – a standard adopted by a national standardisation body and made available to  the public” (ETSI, n.d.).   Taxonomy “is defined as a classification of terms. Three characteristics define a taxonomy:   a form of classification scheme to group related things together and to define the relationship  these things have to each other;   a semantic vocabulary to describe knowledge and information assets; and   a knowledge map to give users an immediately grasp of the overall structure of the knowledge  domain covered by the taxonomy, which should be comprehensive, predictable and easy to  navigate” (ENISA, 2016a, p. 7).  “There is currently no consensus on concepts and definitions related to taxonomies” (ENISA, 2016a, p.  5).   Technical aspects refer to the dimensions of the CSIRT-LEA cooperation that relate to the tools (e.g.  applications, the platforms) and the methodologies used by CSIRTs and LEAs to share information in  their effort to fight against cybercrime.   Traffic Light Protocol (TLP) “is a means for someone sharing information to inform their audience  about any limitations in further spreading this information. It is used in almost all CSIRT communities  and some Information Analysis and Sharing Centres (ISACs). The TLP can be used in all forms of  communication, whether written or oral. […] The TLP is in principle easy to use: the sharer of  information tags the information with a colour. Tagging information consists simply of adding  “TLP:COLOUR” [Red, Amber, Green, White] on a document or part of it. The meaning of the colour  indicates the possibilities for further spreading of the information. Over the years, different wordings  of the TLP have surfaced, but the CSIRT community recently made an effort to clarify the TLP.” “Since  the TLP’s use is ubiquitous in certain communities, it would be easy to think that it is the ultimate  solution for sharing information. It is not. The TLP’s use of four categories is simple, if not simplistic.  There will always be cases where it is not suited to the situation at hand. For example, a presentation  in a meeting of representatives of CSIRTs could be TLP:RED for most of them, except for the one team  present who is able to act on the information, for whom TLP:AMBER would be more suitable. It is  possible to build more complicated examples ad libitum, where the only way out is old-fashioned,  extensive, distribution lists. This does not mean that the TLP is useless. On the contrary, its simplicity  and universality make it ideal for many real-life situations. It is just not a silver bullet” (ENISA, n.d.).  Improving Cooperation between CSIRTs and Law Enforcement: Legal and Organisational Aspects  Version 1.0  |  November 2017  13  2. Methodology  To collect data for this report mainly a qualitative methodological approach has been adopted: indeed, due  to the rather new field addressed, primarily qualitative research has been conducted, in other words a  “Research for the purpose of developing “sensitizing concepts” [- which are “directions along which to  look” (Blumer, 1954, p. 7) -] and verstehen (understanding) rather than quantitative measurement”  (Hagan, 1997, p. 510).  However, some quantitative data has also been collected: an online survey has been conducted to validate  and complement the findings from the desk research and the interviews. The quantitative research carried  out allowed the collection of some “data in the form of numbers” and produced some simple “Descriptive  statistics that includes frequency distributions such as rates, proportions, and percentages as well as  graphic representations of data such as pie charts […and] bar graphs” (Bayens & Roberson, 2011, p. 25).  Information Collection Instruments Used  Desk Research  A first desk research was conducted based on publicly available information sources, including ENISA  publications. The findings from this desk research were particularly useful also for drafting of the  questionnaire to support the interviews.  In addition to the material listed in Chapter 6 - Bibliography/References, examples of sources consulted  and of material reviewed collected during the desk research can be found in Annex D: Samples of Material  Collected During the Desk Research Not Included in the Bibliography/References.  A supplementary desk research was conducted to address specific topics that the project team deemed  appropriate to examine in more depth following the analysis of the data collected via the interviews. These  included areas such as incident handling, information sharing taxonomies, information sharing tools and  platforms, information sharing groups and initiatives, legislation and policies.  The findings from the desk research were particularly useful also for the drafting of the questionnaire to  support the interviews.  Interviews  Structured interviews were conducted with four CSIRT representatives from three Member States and with  five LEA representatives from three Member States. The interviews were conducted during the period  from May 2017 and July 2017. They were mainly conducted via phone and they lasted each around ninety  minutes. Interviewees received the questions in advance and in most cases they had the opportunity to  review the notes taken by the interviewers (project team) with their replies.  Two questionnaires were prepared to support the interviews, one for the interviews with the CSIRTs, one  for the interviews with the LEA (see Annex B: Samples of Questionnaires to Support the Interviews). Some  questions were open questions; most were yes/no questions. For all questions, including yes/no,  interviewees could add comments and additional information.  May-June 2017 was a particularly challenging period to meet interviewees availably, not least because of  their engagement in responding to incidents such as WannaCry and ‘NotPetya’ ransomware attacks.  Some data collected for the report on technical aspects mentioned above were also used to complete and  validate the data collected for this report.  Improving Cooperation between CSIRTs and Law Enforcement: Legal and Organisational Aspects  Version 1.0  |  November 2017  14  Online Survey  An online survey was conducted to collect additional data to validate and further substantiate some  findings. It was composed of eight questions (see Annex C: Questions in the Online Survey), all with closed  answers and some with the possibility to add additional comments and provide more details related to the  answers. Several rounds of testing took place. The estimated time to fill in the online survey was less than  ten minutes.  The survey was developed by using the EUSurvey, a survey tool which is “supported by the European  Commission's ISA programme, which promotes interoperability solutions for European public  administrations” (European Commission, n.d. a).  The invitation to fill the survey was sent to the closed ENISA mailing list of European national and  governmental CSIRTs, which includes around forty-five teams. In addition, it was sent via Europol to the  European Union Cybercrime Task Force (EUCTF), which is “composed of the Heads of the designated  National Cybercrime Units throughout the EU Member States and Europol” (Council of the European  Union, 2017a, p. 13).  The survey was launched in August 2017 and was open for around two weeks. The data collected via the  online survey was used to validate the data collected through the desk research and interviews and also to  produce some simple statistics.  Twenty-five replies were received: thirteen respondents were from CSIRT community, eleven from the law  enforcement community and one belonged to both areas. An overview of the composition of the  respondents based on the community they belong to is presented hereinafter in Figure 1.  Figure 1 – Overview of Respondents to the Online Survey Based on the Community They Belong to  Twenty-three respondents were from nineteen of the twenty-eight EU Member States (European Union,  2017), two respondents were from EFTA countries (EFTA, n.d.).  Most respondents replied to all questions, despite most questions not being mandatory. Some  respondents used the comment box to provide extra information.  Improving Cooperation between CSIRTs and Law Enforcement: Legal and Organisational Aspects  Version 1.0  |  November 2017  15  Data Used to Develop the Recommendations  The recommendations in Chapter 5.2 have been developed based on research findings and the results of  this report as well as of the parallel ENISA report on Tools and Methodologies to Support Cooperation  between CSIRTs and Law Enforcement (ENISA, 2017).  Selection and Classification of the Stakeholders  This research was carried out in order to understand how the cooperation, in particular communication,  between the two mentioned communities can be further improved. This is aimed at supporting the fight  against cybercrime and collaboration between CSIRTs and LEAs, as envisaged by the ENISA Programming  Document 2017-2019 (ENISA, 2017b).  The stakeholders selected for the interviews were:   First, CSIRTs, mostly, national CSIRTs and governmental CSIRTs. However, in order to better  understand how communication between CSIRTs and LEAs really works, some CSIRTs have been  interviewed, which were neither national CSIRTs nor governmental CSIRTs;   Second, LEAs, in particular national LEAs from different European Union countries, were interviewed.  However, some local LEAs were also interviewed for a better understanding of the local realities.  The key stakeholders for this report are all CSIRTs and LEAs exchanging data between each other. Additional  report recipients are legislators and all those who can define policies and procedures for improving  communication between CSIRTs and LEAs.  Contribution by Subject Matter Experts  ENISA selected four external subject-matter experts from the List of NIS Experts compiled following the  ENISA Call for Expression of Interest (CEI) (Ref. ENISA M-CEI-17-T01), who contributed to this report ad  personam by supporting the data collection and analysis. These experts contributed inter alia to the report  with their legal expertise in NIS (including but not limited to policy monitoring activities, legal framework  relevant to the information sharing, and digital forensics) and their expertise in NIS aspects of cybercrime  and in incident response.  In addition to ENISA internal reviewers and project team reviewers, some external experts/organisations  peer-reviewed this report (or part of it) and their feedback were incorporated in the final draft.  Improving Cooperation between CSIRTs and Law Enforcement: Legal and Organisational Aspects  Version 1.0  |  November 2017  16  3. Overview of the Policy Context  Some General Remarks Regarding the Cooperation between CSIRTs and LEAs  Below follow some preliminary remarks related to the context surrounding the cooperation between  CSIRTs and LEAs to fight against cybercrime.  Not all Incidents Are Cybercrimes and Not All Cybercrimes Are Incidents  In the absence of an unequivocal definition of cybercrime, in general by it we can refer both to crime  having a computer as a target and crimes where computer is a tool to commit traditional or news crimes.  By “incident” is meant “any event having an actual adverse effect on the security of network and  information system” (Article 7 (7) of the NIS Directive (European Parliament and Council of the European  Union, 2016a)).  On the one hand, there might be accidental unforeseeable events that have an adverse effect on the  security of a system and that can be considered as incidents. However, because they are not intentional  and could not be even foreseen, in principle, they cannot be considered as a cybercrime. On the other  hand, crimes where computer is merely a tool (e.g. storage of illegal images on a computer or using a  computer to plan a murder) can be considered in a broad sense as cybercrime, but they are not defined as  incidents.  Cooperation between CSIRTs and LEAs Does Not Take Place for All Cybercrime Cases  There are some cases where cooperation between CSIRTs and LEAs does not take place. For example,  because the crime under police investigations involves computers but it is not an incident (see 3.1.1). The  other example is when an incident is not reported as a crime, for instance, because the victim is afraid of  possible reputational damages, or does not know how and to whom to report it.  CSIRT and LEAs are Different as Well as Their Objectives  CSIRTs focus on preventing and mitigating incidents and, as highlighted in previous ENISA’s studies CSIRTs  “compared to the investigatory character of LEAs […] [CSIRTs] operate on an informal basis [see (ENISA,  2011a)], which allegedly permits them to be agile in their response” (ENISA, 2012, p. 27). By comparison,  LEAs are generally bound by a formal procedural approach of following rules and a hierarchical authority  for the purpose of supporting criminal investigations and the producing evidence to be used before a Court  of Law. This is partly due to the different objectives that each community is trying to achieve but it is also  bound up with discreet features of each community. LEAs are for instance driven by Penal Law procedures  because of the sort of standards that pervade their work (e.g. in maintaining the evidential chain,  motivating and often justifying decisions, adhering to the framework concerning the rights of investigated  parties, etc.) (ENISA, 2012, p. 27). When investigations end before a court, a clear path is required to justify  the way evidence has been collected in a way that and legal objections of the suspect and her defence can  be successfully confronted. Apart from that, LEAs work as any other hierarchical organization where  usually justification of decisions may need to take place.  CSIRTs and LEAs, and Other Actors  CSIRTs and LEAs are not the sole actors when it comes to cope with cybercrime. Their cooperation in  fighting cybercrime is accompanied by other actors and usually there is also interaction of CSIRTs and LEAs  with other entities, there are several other actors that are part of the scene, such as:   The criminal - or more correctly as far as he/she is not sentenced - the suspect;   The victim, which can be an individual, a company, or a private organisation;  Improving Cooperation between CSIRTs and Law Enforcement: Legal and Organisational Aspects  Version 1.0  |  November 2017  17   The judiciary, in other words, public prosecutors and judges who come to play their important role in  cases where the conditions to prosecute are met;   The telecommunication operators;   The internet service providers;   The systems and network administrators (e.g. of the victim, of third persons or even of the criminal),  that might have important pieces of information to support not only the incident handing but also the  crime investigation;   The IT security companies, that provide information and solutions, in some cases even in real time  during the incident mitigations and criminal investigations;   The insurance companies, with which the victims might have stipulated insurances to cover  cybercrime damages;   The national cyber security authorities (e.g. cyber security centres);   The intelligence community;   The military;   The subject-matter experts who might belong to one of the organisations mentioned in this list or may  act as individuals;   The CSIRTs Network that as provided in Article 12 of the NIS Directive (European Parliament and  Council of the European Union, 2016a) is “composed of representatives of the Member States' CSIRTs  and CERT-EU” and other national, supranational and international CSIRTs networks, ISACs and fora  (e.g. FIRST, TF-CSIRT, and European FI-ISAC);   The malware and threat information sharing groups, including MISP project (MISP Project, n.d.).   ENISA that provides the Secretariat of the CSIRTs Network and actively supports the cooperation  among the CSIRTs and, together with Europol’s EC3, the cooperation between CSIRTs and LEAs;   Europol’s European Cybercrime Centre (EC3) set in 2013 by Europol “to strengthen the law  enforcement response to cybercrime in the EU and thus to help protect European citizens, businesses  and governments from online crime” (European Cybercrime Centre - EC3, n.d.);   The international law enforcement agencies, including INTERPOL (INTERPOL, n.d.);   Academia;   Other stakeholders, for instance, subjects other than those mentioned above that might be affected  by the incident handling/cybercrime response: examples are clients of the victims (for instance when  the victim, for instance a bank or an electricity company, provide services) or other subjects somehow  sharing – even involuntarily and unaware of the crime – hardware and software with the criminal.  Variety of CSIRTs, LEAs, and Ways of Cooperating  Services offered, consistency, size and maturity level vary considerably from CSIRT to CSIRT.  National and governmental CSIRTs play particularly important roles: “Currently in the EU, governmental  CSIRTs are typically used to protect the cyberspace of governmental institutions including critical  infrastructure as well as to ensure cyber-crisis management. National CSIRTs, on the other hand, are  playing different roles in different countries. In some countries they are responsible for the whole IP  address space of that country, in others they also take the role of ‘last resort’ when no security contact  point for an IP address can be found. In any case, when another country has to be contacted regarding  solving an incident, national CSIRTs are often asked to help to find the right contact person. Increasingly  CSIRTs expect other teams with comparable competences to react to their requests in a timely manner and  to handle shared information professionally” (ENISA, 2015c, p. 9).  In many European countries there are also sectorial CSIRTs. They handle incidents and assist in particular  critical sectors (e.g. finance, health, energy). Their constituency is about the sector as a whole.  Improving Cooperation between CSIRTs and Law Enforcement: Legal and Organisational Aspects  Version 1.0  |  November 2017  18  Like for CSIRTs, there are many kinds of LEAs. For instance, there are local, federal, national, supranational  and international LEAs. Also responsibilities and powers might vary from LEA to LEA. There are LEAs that  are specialised in cybercrime investigations. Also size and resources of LEAs might be quite different from  LEA to LEA and, in general, depending on the country.  The overall cooperation between CSIRTs and LEAs is affected by the type of CSIRT and LEA involved, and  whether liaison officers are appointed or not.  CSIRTs and LEAs share information both formally (e.g. in the context of an official written request for  information regarding a specific case) and informally (e.g. when information is shared orally during an  informal phone call). Both formal and informal channels require a legal basis and either type of  information sharing between CSIRTs and LEAs need to be in line with applicable legislation.  The level and sophistication of information shared depends also on the level of formalisation of the  cooperation between CSIRTs and LEAs.  According to the results from the online survey shown in Figure 2, CSIRTs and LEAs share mainly three  types of information: malicious campaign and context information, IP addresses, and information on the  modus operandi of the attacker and indicators of compromise (IOC).  Figure 2 - Information Shared Formally between CSIRTs and LEAs according to the Online Survey  In addition to formal information sharing, CSIRT and LEAs share information informally.  According to the results from the online survey shown in Figure 3, most information shared informally are  indicators of compromise (IOC), malicious campaigns and context information, IP addresses, statistics and  reports on cases dealt with and on trends, and information on modus operandi of the attacker.  Improving Cooperation between CSIRTs and Law Enforcement: Legal and Organisational Aspects  Version 1.0  |  November 2017  19  Figure 3 - Information Shared Informally According to the Online Survey  Figure 4 provides some compared data regarding which data are shared formally and informally.  Figure 4 - Comparison Between Kind of Information Shared Between CSIRTs and LEAs Formally and Informally, According to the  Data Collected Via the Online Survey  According to the data collected via the online survey, personal information (other than IP addresses) does  not often seem to be the object of information sharing between CSIRTs and LEAs, neither formally nor  informally.  Improving Cooperation between CSIRTs and Law Enforcement: Legal and Organisational Aspects  Version 1.0  |  November 2017  20  According to the data collected via the interviews, two different levels of cooperation between the CSIRTs  and LEAs can be identified:   A cooperation at higher level via the liaison officer (when there is a liaison office). At this higher level  the general framework of the cooperation is set but the actual materialisation of this framework is  often ad hoc, depending on the case   Ad hoc specific cooperation is the cooperation between the CSIRT and LEA personnel working on the  specific case dealt with  Level of formalities might also vary depending on the level of cooperation and on the country. The second  level of cooperation is almost always facilitated by the liaison office, if present, and a result of the first  level of cooperation.  Importance of Reciprocal Feedback  As it emerged both from the interviews and the online survey, feedback represents an important element  to improve the cooperation between CSIRTs and LEAs. See Figure 5.  Figure 5: Overview of How Much Feedback Would Improve the Cooperation Between CSIRT and LE, According to the Data  Collected Via the Online Survey  Main Legal and Policy Framework for the Cooperation between CSIRTs and LEAs  The legal and policy context plays an important role in governing and shaping the cooperation between  CSIRTs and LEAs in fighting against cybercrime. The section hereinafter describes some of the most  relevant international and EU legislation and policies in the field.  It is worth mentioning the need for technology-neutral laws. On the one hand, the cybercrime landscape is  changing very fast; on the other hand, it usually takes a long time to create a piece of legislation, especially  in the case of international law. This is why it is extremely important to create such legislative solutions  which will be efficient not only today, but also in five and ten years’ time or more.  Improving Cooperation between CSIRTs and Law Enforcement: Legal and Organisational Aspects  Version 1.0  |  November 2017  21  Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime (“Budapest Convention”)  The Council of Europe (CoE) (Council of Europe, n.d.) was established in 1949 to uphold and strengthen  human rights, democracy and the rule of law within Europe. The Council consists of forty-seven Member  States, including all the Members of the European Union.  In 1995 the CoE presented a report concerning the adequacy of criminal procedures laws in the area of  computer-related threats and hacking. Following this initiative, in 1997 the Committee of Experts on Crime  in Cyberspace was established to prepare a convention which could facilitate international cooperation in  the investigation and prosecution of computer crimes. The Convention on Cybercrime was opened for  signature in Budapest, Hungary, in November 2001.  The Convention on Cybercrime (ETS No. 185) (Council of Europe, 2001) (Council of Europe, n.d. a), also  called the “Budapest Convention”, is the first international treaty and remains the most relevant  international treaty on cybercrime and electronic evidence. It requires Parties to criminalise offences  against and by means of computers in their domestic criminal law (Articles 2 to 11), to provide their law  enforcement with the necessary powers to secure electronic evidence not only in relation to cybercrime  but any crime entailing evidence on a computer systems (Articles 16 to 21) – while making these powers  subject to rule of law safeguards (Article 15), and to engage in international cooperation on cybercrime  and electronic evidence (Articles 23 to 35).  The Cybercrime Convention Committee (T-CY) representing the Parties to this treaty assesses the  implementation of the treaty, issues Guidance Notes and may also prepare additional protocols to the  Convention. The European Union (including the European Commission and the Council of the European  Union, Eurojust, Europol and ENISA) are observers in this Committee.  The Convention is not only open to the Members of the CoE but any country committed and able to  implement this treaty may accede. By October 2017, fifty-six States – European countries but also  Australia, Canada, Chile, Costa Rica, Dominican Republic, Japan, Senegal, Sri Lanka, USA and others – had  been Parties and a further fourteen had signed it or been invited to accede. All EU Member States had  signed the Convention, and all except for two had also ratified it. The Chart of signatures and ratifications  of the Convention is available on the Council of Europe website (Council of Europe, n.d. b).  The Additional Protocol to the Convention on Cybercrime, concerning the criminalisation of acts of a racist  and xenophobic nature committed through computer systems (ETS No.189) of 28 January 2003 “entails an  extension of the Cybercrime Convention’s scope, including its substantive, procedural and international  cooperation provisions, so as to cover also offences of racist or xenophobic propaganda. Thus, apart from  harmonising the substantive law elements of such behaviour, the Protocol aims at improving the ability of  the Parties to make use of the means and avenues of international cooperation set out in the Convention  […] in this area” (Council of Europe, n.d. c).  As also mentioned in the recent Joint Communication on Resilience, Deterrence and Defence: Building  strong cybersecurity for the EU (European Commission and High Representative of the Union for Foreign  Affairs and Security Policy, 2017), “A possible addition of a protocol to the Convention is now being  explored [ (Council of Europe Cybercrime Convention Committee, 2017)], which could also provide a useful  opportunity to address the issue of cross-border access to electronic evidence in an international context.  Rather than the creation of new international legal instruments for cybercrime issues, the EU calls for all  countries to design appropriate national legislation and pursue cooperation within this existing  international framework”. The negotiation of such a Protocol commenced in September 2017 and is  expected to be completed by December 2019.  Improving Cooperation between CSIRTs and Law Enforcement: Legal and Organisational Aspects  Version 1.0  |  November 2017  22  Directive on Attack Against Information Systems  The Directive on attacks against information systems (European Parliament and Council of the European  Union, 2013), replacing Council Framework Decision 2005/222/JHA (Council of the European Union, 2005),  entered into force in August 2013 and its implementation deadline was in September 2015. This Directive  integrated elements of the Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime (Council of Europe, 2001).  The Directive was an important step in the EU’s effort to create the European rules to combat cybercrime.  According to the Directive there are four main substantive offences (together, the “Substantive Offences”)  of:   Illegal access to information systems   Illegal system interference   Illegal data interference; and   Illegal interception.  The Directive also increases the cooperation between competent authorities to enable a response to urgent  information requests with a response time of no more than eight hours and also to monitor and record  statistical data and report on cybercrime offences and criminal convictions.  As foreseen according to the Directive, the European Commission has compiled a report assessing the  extent to which the Member States have taken the necessary measures in order to comply with this  Directive. This report was published on 13 September 2017 (European Commission, 2017a).  Europe 2020, the Digital Agenda for Europe (DAE), Digital Single Market Strategy for Europe  (DSM), and the Cyber Security Strategy (CSS)  3.2.3.1 Europe 2020  In June 2010, ten-years strategy EUROPE 2020 A strategy for smart, sustainable and inclusive growth  (European Commission, 2010a) from the European Commission was issued. It sets objectives for the  growth of the European Union. One of the pillars was the Digital Agenda.  3.2.3.2 Digital Agenda for Europe  Launched in May 2010, A Digital Agenda for Europe (DAE) (European Commission, 2010b) is the action plan  for Europe for making the best use of information and communication technologies (ICT) so that the  sustainable digital future could be build. The main goal of the document was to take actions which will  remove obstacles to maximising the potential of ICTs, with long-term investments to minimise future  problems. The Digital Agenda “is aimed at boosting Europe’s economy by delivering sustainable economic  and social benefits from a digital single market” (European Commission, 2014).  3.2.3.3 Digital Single Market Strategy for Europe (DSM Strategy)  Creating the Digital Single Market is one of the seven goals of the Digital Agenda. As the continuation of  this policy, in May 2015, A Digital Single Market Strategy for Europe (European Commission, 2015a) was  adopted. It contains a number of initiatives, the implementation of which should open up digital  opportunities for people and business and enhance Europe’s position as a world leader in the digital  economy.  There are three pillars of the DSM Strategy:  1. Better access for consumers and business to online goods (helping to make the EU’s digital world a  seamless and level marketplace to buy and sell)  Improving Cooperation between CSIRTs and Law Enforcement: Legal and Organisational Aspects  Version 1.0  |  November 2017  23  2. The right environment for digital networks and services (designing rules which match the pace of  technology and support infrastructure development)  3. Economy and Society (ensuring that Europe’s economy, industry and employment take full advantage  of what digitalisation offers)  “Trust and security are at the core of the Digital Single Market Strategy, while the fight against cybercrime  is one of the three pillars of the European Agenda on Security” (European Commission, 2015b). Without  these two elements the European Union could not create right environment for digital economy to grow.  The Commission leads a big number of projects whose aim is to boost internet trust and security.  In May 2017 the Commission has published the mid-term review of the DSM Strategy (European  Commission, 2017b), which took stock of the progress made and called on co-legislators to swiftly act on  all proposals already presented, as well as outlines further actions on online platforms, data economy and  cybersecurity.  3.2.3.4 Cyber Security Strategy (CSS) and Joint Communication on Resilience, Deterrence and Defence  As one of the initiatives of the DSM Strategy supporting the Digital Agenda, in 2013 European Commission  presented the Cybersecurity Strategy of the European Union: An Open, Safe and Secure Cyberspace  (European Commission and High Representative of the European Union for Foreign Affairs and Security  Policy, 2013). It was the first strategic document on the European level which only referred to  cybersecurity. The document sets out the EU's approach on best preventing and responding to cyber  disruptions and attacks. The Strategy also emphasises that fundamental rights, democracy and the rule of  law need to be protected in cyberspace.  Achieving cyber resilience and drastically reducing cybercrime are given as strategic priorities and actions.  To do it, it was recognised that the effective cooperation between public authorities and the private sector  is absolutely crucial. The strategy also stressed that the national NIS competent authorities should  collaborate and exchange information with other regulatory bodies.  In September 2017 the European Commission and the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affiairs  and Security Policy presented the Joint Communication on Resilience, Deterrence and Defence: Building  strong cybersecurity for the EU (European Commission and High Representative of the Union for Foreign  Affairs and Security Policy, 2017). Three main goals for Europe are identified as:  1. Building EU resilience to cyberattacks  2. Creating effective EU cyber deterrence  3. Strengthening international cooperation on cybersecurity  Public-private cooperation against cybercrime is named as one of the most important activity’s in the field  of creating effective EU cyber deterrence. It is underlined that “cooperation with the private sector,  including industry and civil society, is fundamental for public authorities to fight crime effectively”  (European Commission and High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, 2017).  The financial sector was pointed as an example of such cooperation (addressing online fraud and  cybercrime). It is also emphasised that “private undertaking need to be able to share information on  concrete incidents with law enforcement – including personal data – in full respect of data protection  rules” (European Commission and High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy,  2017).  The public-private cooperation in the field of fighting cybercrime accentuates the need of cooperation  between LEA and CSIRT established in different sectors such as finance, energy or telecommunication. This  creates new challenges, since every sector has its own specificities and CSIRT constituency might be  Improving Cooperation between CSIRTs and Law Enforcement: Legal and Organisational Aspects  Version 1.0  |  November 2017  24  different from sector to sector. The NIS Directive requires the establishment of CSIRTs for so called  essential services operators (more about NIS Directive in the next section).  NIS Directive  The Directive (EU) 2016/1148 concerning measures for a high common level of security of network and  information systems across the Union (European Parliament and Council of the European Union, 2016a) (so  called “NIS Directive”) was adopted in July 2016. The initial project of the NIS Directive was presented  jointly with the European Cybersecurity Strategy in 2013 (European Commission and High Representative  of the European Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, 2013).  The NIS Directive “lays down measures with a view to achieving a high common level of security of  network and information systems within the Union so as to improve the functioning of the internal  market” (Article 1). The NIS Directive creates the culture of security across sectors which are vital for our  economy and society and moreover rely heavily on ICTs, such as energy, transport, water, banking,  financial market infrastructures, healthcare and digital infrastructure. Businesses in these sectors that are  identified by the Member States as operators of essential services will have to take appropriate security  measures and to notify serious incidents to the relevant national authority. Also key digital service  providers (search engines, cloud computing services and online marketplaces) will have to comply with the  security and notification requirements under the NIS Directive.  The NIS Directive provides obligations for all Member States to adopt a national cyber security strategy  and to designate national competent authorities, single points of contact and CSIRTs with tasks related to  the security of network and information systems. Both the operators of essential services and the digital  service providers are required to report the incidents. In addition, they are also required to take  appropriate and proportionate technical and organisational measures to manage the risks posed to the  security of network and information systems which they use in their operations.  The NIS Directive also creates a new mechanism for cooperation among all the Member States. This  cooperation will take place within the Cooperation Network, which is composed of the Cooperation Group  and the CSIRTs Network. The Cooperation Group supports and facilitates strategic cooperation and the  exchange of information among Member States. The CSIRTs Network supports and promotes promote  swift and effective operational cooperation on specific cybersecurity incidents and sharing information  about risks.  The CSIRTs Network already proved its effectiveness during two large scale incidents: WannaCry and  ‘NotPetya’.  Communication on Strengthening Europe's Cyber Resilience System and Recommendation on  Coordinated Response to Large Scale Cybersecurity Incidents and Crises (“Blueprint”)  The Communication from the European Commission on Strengthening Europe's Cyber Resilience System  and Fostering a Competitive and Innovative Cybersecurity Industry (European Commission, 2016) was  presented in July 2016.  It has three goals:  1. Stepping up cooperation to enhance preparedness and deal with cyber incidents  2. Addressing challenges facing Europe’s cybersecurity Single Market  3. Nurturing industrial capabilities in the field of cybersecurity  Improving Cooperation between CSIRTs and Law Enforcement: Legal and Organisational Aspects  Version 1.0  |  November 2017  25  In the field of information sharing and cooperation among the Member States, the Commission decided to  prepare a cooperation blueprint to handle large-scale cyber incidents on the EU level, facilitate the  creation of an “information hub” to support the exchange of information between EU bodies and Member  States as well as work in the close cooperation with Member States, ENISA, EEAS and other relevant EU  bodies to establish a cybersecurity training platform.  Training and exercises are identified as one of the best tools to increase the cooperation between Member  States, because they are the opportunity to practice and test the procedures and – if they are not efficient  – to reformulate them.  In September 2017, the European Commission issued the Recommendation on Coordinated Response to  Large Scale Cybersecurity Incidents and Crises (European Commission, 2017c), that recommends inter alia  the following:   “Member States and EU institutions should establish an EU Cybersecurity Crisis Response Framework  integrating the objectives and modalities of cooperation presented in the Blueprint following the  guiding principles described therein” (see point (1));   “Member States should ensure that their national crisis management mechanisms adequately address  cybersecurity incident response as well as provide necessary procedures for cooperation at EU level  within the context of the EU Framework” (see point (4);   “Member States should make full use of the opportunities offered by the Cybersecurity Digital Service  Infrastructures (DSI) programme of the Connecting Europe Facility (CEF) [ (European Commission, n.d.  c)], and cooperate with the Commission to ensure that the Core Service Platform cooperation  mechanism, currently under development, provides the necessary functionalities and fulfils their  requirements for cooperation also during cybersecurity crises”;   “Member States, with the assistance of ENISA and building on previous work in this area, should  cooperate in developing and adopting a common taxonomy and template for situational reports to  describe the technical causes and impacts of cybersecurity incidents to further enhance their technical  and operational cooperation during crises” (see point (7)).  European Agenda for Security  In April 2015 the European Agenda for Security for the period 2015-2020 (European Commission, 2015c)  was adopted. The European Commission goal was to support Member States' cooperation in tackling  security threats and step up common efforts in the fight against terrorism, organised crime and  cybercrime. The Agenda sets out the concrete tools and measures which will be used in this joint work to  ensure security and tackle these three most pressing threats more effectively.  Naming fighting against cybercrime as one of the three main goals, the document also confirms how  important this issue has become for the whole of Europe. The international nature of cybercrime is very  hard to fight and that was the reason to name reinforcing tools to fight cybercrime as the one of the key  action.  European Investigation Order  Directive 2014/41/EU (European Parliament and Council of the European Union, 2014) concerns the  European Investigation Order (EIO) in criminal matters.  The EIO is “a judicial decision which has been issued or validated by a judicial authority of a Member State  (‘the issuing State’) to have one or several specific investigative measure(s) carried out in another Member  State (‘the executing State’) to obtain evidence in accordance with this Directive” (Article 1).  Improving Cooperation between CSIRTs and Law Enforcement: Legal and Organisational Aspects  Version 1.0  |  November 2017  26  The EIO replaces the traditional letters rogatory, freezing orders and the European evidence warrant. The  mentioned Directive establishes a single investigative tool valid for any type of evidence. Therefore, the  EIO may be relevant for digital evidence stored by CSIRTs of one or more other Member States that a LEA  needs to gather.  The deadline for the transposition of this Directive into national law was 22 May 2017. However, the  situation at 26 October 2017 is that the Directive 2014/41/EU is transposed into national laws in sixteen  Member States.  European Public Prosecutor's Office (EPPO)  The regulation establishing the European Public Prosecutor’s Office (EPPO) (Council of the European  Union, 2017b) was adopted on 12 October 2017 by Member States which are part of the EPPO enhanced  cooperation. So far, twenty Member States have joined such an enhanced cooperation, i.e. Austria,  Belgium, Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Estonia, Germany, Greece, Spain, Finland, France, Italy,  Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Portugal, Romania, Slovenia, and Slovakia (European Council, Council of the  European Union, 2017c). The EPPO is an independent body of the EU which will be in charge of  investigating, prosecuting and bringing to justice the perpetrators of offences against the EU’s financial  interests. The creation of the EPPO is aimed at improving transnational investigations and it is likely to play  a role in facilitating the cooperation between LEAs and CSIRTs of different countries when they have to  exchange data concerning offenses against the EU’s financial interests.  EU Data Protection Legislation  3.2.9.1 Principle of EU Data Protection legislation  The main principles inspiring data protection legislation in the EU are the following:   Article 8 (Right to respect for private and family life) of the Convention for the Protection of Human  Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, also known as the European Convention on Human Rights (Council  of Europe, 1950);   Article 7 (Respect for private and family life) of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European  Union (European Parliament, Council and Commission, 2000);   Article 8 (Protection of personal data) of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union  (European Parliament, Council and Commission, 2000);   Article 16 (on the protection of personal data) (ex Article 286 TEC) of the Treaty on the Functioning of  the European Union (TFEU) (The Member States ).  3.2.9.2 General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)  The Regulation (EU) 2016/679 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of  personal data and on the free movement of such data, also known as “General Data Protection Regulation”  (European Parliament and Council of the European Union, 2016b), repealing Directive 95/46/EC (European  Parliament and Council of the European Union, 1995), was adopted by the EU Parliament on 14 April 2016,  it is already in force and, as provided in Article 99, it will apply from 25 May 2018. This new legislation was  designed to harmonise data privacy laws across Europe, to protect and empower all EU citizen’s data  privacy and to reshape the way organisations across the region approach data privacy (European  Commision, 2017).  The GDPR is the answer to the development of modern technologies. It introduces significant changes in  the EU Data protection legislation. First of all, it increases the territorial scope of the jurisdiction (it applies  to all companies processing the personal data and data of subject residing in the Union). The GDPR also  introduces significant penalties for companies for a breach of regulations. With the GDPR privacy by design  Improving Cooperation between CSIRTs and Law Enforcement: Legal and Organisational Aspects  Version 1.0  |  November 2017  27  (for more information on privacy by design see also (ENISA, 2014), which has existed so far as a concept,  becomes now “essential elements in EU data protection rules” (European Commision, 2017).  With the definition of personal data as any information related to a natural person or “Data Subject”, that  can be used to directly or indirectly identify the person, there is also the common understanding that IP  addresses are personal data. They can be directly or indirectly related to the individuals and those  individuals could be identified.  Based on applicable legislation and the common interpretation, in principle also when dealing with IP  addresses CSIRTs process personal data: according to the decision of the European Court of Justice on  dynamic IP addresses (Court of Justice of the European Union, 2016), the IP addresses are personal data  also if the data subject cannot be identified without the intervention of the third party.  According to the Article 23 of the GDPR those rules can be restricted in case of national security, defence,  public security, the prevention, investigation, detection or prosecution of criminal offences or the  execution of criminal penalties, including the safeguarding and the prevention of threats to public security.  However, that creates uncertainty when personal data is processed in criminal investigations, defence,  public and state security. Also the Recital 49 of the GDPR sets the legal ground for the processing of  personal data by CSIRTs by affirming that: “The processing of personal data to the extent strictly necessary  and proportionate for the purposes of ensuring network and information security, […] and the security of  the related services offered by, or accessible via, those networks and systems, by public authorities, by  computer emergency response teams (CERTs), computer security incident response teams (CSIRTs), by  providers of electronic communications networks and services and by providers of security technologies  and services, constitutes a legitimate interest of the data controller concerned.”  The processing of personal data to the extent that is strictly necessary and proportionate for the purposes  of ensuring network and information security (i.e. the ability of a network or an information system to  resist, at a given level of confidence, accidental events or unlawful or malicious actions that compromise  the availability, authenticity, integrity and confidentiality of stored or transmitted personal data, and the  security of the related services offered by, or accessible via, those networks and systems, by public  authorities, by CSIRTs, by providers of electronic communications networks and services and by providers  of security technologies and services) constitutes a legitimate interest of the data controller concerned.  This could, for example, include preventing unauthorised access to electronic communications networks  and malicious code distribution and stopping “denial of service” attacks and damage to computer and  electronic communication system.  With the GDPR regulation CSIRTs should carefully plan the collection and processing of data and  information, personal data included. The CSIRT community should also avoid processing personal data  which is not consistent with the purposes, processing sensitive personal data unless strictly required and  sharing personal data that is not necessary or required to by law. Because of that, a close consultation and  cooperation between CSIRTs and Data Protection Authorities is advisable.  3.2.9.3 Directive on Privacy and Electronic Communications  The Directive 2002/58/EC concerning the processing of personal data and the protection of privacy in the  electronic communications sector (so called “Directive on Privacy and eCommunications”) (European  Parliament and Council of the European Union, 2002) as amended by Directive 2009/136/EC (European  Parliament and Council of the European Union, 2009), aims to harmonise the provisions of the Member  States required to ensure an equivalent level of protection of fundamental rights and freedoms, and in  particular the right to privacy and to confidentiality, with respect to the processing of personal data in the  Improving Cooperation between CSIRTs and Law Enforcement: Legal and Organisational Aspects  Version 1.0  |  November 2017  28  electronic communication sector and to ensure the free movement of such data and of electronic  communication equipment and services in the European Union.  GDPR (European Parliament and Council of the European Union, 2016b) clarifies that Directive 2002/58/EC  continues to apply after the adoption of the Regulation, but that once the GDPR is adopted, “Directive  2002/58/EC should be reviewed in particular in order to ensure consistency with this Regulation” (Recital  173).  There is a Proposal for a Regulation concerning the respect for private life and the protection of personal  data in electronic communications and repealing Directive 2002/58/EC (Regulation on Privacy and  eCommunications) (European Commission, 2017d). The proposed regulation seeks to increase the  protection of people’s private life and open up new opportunities for business. Two areas of the proposal  are of particular interest to this CSIRT-LE cooperation, namely:   Communications content and metadata: privacy is an issue in terms of communications content and  metadata, e.g. time and place of a call being made, as metadata is often relied upon to trace suspects  and activities leading to the conclusion that anonymization and deletion might be privacy enhancing  measures. According to the proposal processing can be carried out following consent of the parties  involved, which clearly must be given at a time prior to the investigation;   New business opportunities: once consent is granted for communications data (content and  metadata) to be processed, telecoms operators can develop a broader set of business activities and  services. In the proposed Regulation the case of heat maps indicating the presence of individuals is  mentioned. Having an exact inventory of such business models along with their functionalities and  impact for criminal investigations are likely to be of help to CSIRT and LE investigations.  This proposal follows the ordinary legislative procedure (ex-codecision procedure) (European Council,  Council of the European Union, n.d.) (European Parliament, n.d.).  The decision-making process related to  this proposal can be monitored by consulting the related Procedure File (2017/0003(COD) (European  Parliament, n.d. a) in the European Parliament Legislative Observatory database (European Parliament,  n.d. b).  3.2.9.4 LEA DP Directive  The Directive (EU) 2016/680 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal  data by competent authorities for the purposes of the prevention, investigation, detection or prosecution of  criminal offences or the execution of criminal penalties (referred as “LEA DP Directive”) (European  Parliament and Council of the European Union, 2016) repeals the Council Framework Decision  2008/977/JHA (Council of the European Union, 2008).  This Directive sets the legal basis for processing of personal data by competent authorities and law  enforcement agencies in the framework of criminal investigation. According to Article 10, processing of  personal data relating to criminal convictions and offences or related security measures should be carried  out only under the control of official authority or when the processing is authorised by Union or Member  State law providing for appropriate safeguards for the rights and freedoms of data subjects.  Directive on the Use of Passenger Name Record (PNR) Data for the Prevention, Detection,  Investigation and Prosecution of Terrorist Offences and Serious crime  The Directive (EU) 2016/681 addresses issues related to the use of Passenger Name Record (PNR) data for  the prevention, detection, investigation and prosecution of terrorist offences and serious crime (European  Parliament and Council of the European Union, 2016c). Among the serious crimes, computer-related  crime/cybercrime punishable by a custodial sentence or a detention order for a maximum period of at  least three years under the national law of a Member State is included.  Improving Cooperation between CSIRTs and Law Enforcement: Legal and Organisational Aspects  Version 1.0  |  November 2017  29  Article 18 par. 1 states that “Member States shall bring into force the laws, regulations and administrative  provisions necessary to comply with this Directive by 25 May 2018”. The Directive (EU) 2016/681 provides  that the effective use of PNR data is necessary to prevent, detect, investigate and prosecute terrorist  offences and serious crime. This implies the need to process PNR data safely. For this reason, there should  be CSIRTs specifically dedicated to ensuring the security of PNRs.  In addition, this Directive provides that the exchange of data between air carrier and LEA should only be  carried out by means of a push method, i.e. the air carriers transfer the required PNR data to the authority  requesting them, thus allowing air carriers to retain control of what data is provided. In particular, it is not  recommended the use of a “pull” method, where the competent authorities of the Member State  requiring the PNR data can access the air carrier's reservation system and extract a copy of the required  PNR data.  ENISA Regulation  ENISA, the European Union Agency for Network and Information Security, was established in 2004. The  Regulation (EU) No 526/2013 set out the current mandate and tasks for ENISA (European Parliament and  Council of the European Union, 2013). ENISA is a “centre of expertise for cyber security in Europe”  (ENISA,  n.d. c). The Agency cooperates with Members States and private sector to deliver both advice and  solutions. ENISA facilitates Pan-European Cyber Security Exercises (Cyber Europe), which main goal is to  strengthen cooperation in the field of cybersecurity on both European and state level. Standard Operation  Procedures, which were prepared during these exercises are the tool to exchange information on a  European level.  Since 2013 the challenges related to network and information security have evolved. ENISA acquired also  new tasks. According to the NIS Directive (European Parliament and Council of the European Union,  2016a), for instance, the Agency provides the Secretariat of CSIRTs Network.  The role that ENISA plays in the security of electronic communications is also highlighted by Proposal for a  Directive establishing the European Electronic Communications Code (European Parliament and Council of  the European Union, 2016d). In fact, such a proposal provides that “Competent authorities should ensure  that the integrity and availability of public communications networks are maintained. ENISA should  contribute to an enhanced level of security of electronic communications by, amongst other things,  providing expertise and advice, and promoting the exchange of best practices” (Recital 92).  In September 2017 the European Commission presented a proposal for a new mandate for ENISA  (European Commision, 2017a) (European Commission, 2017b). According to this proposal, the reformed  ENISA would have a permanent stronger mandate with related adequate resources.  This proposal, submitted to the Council of the European Union and to the European Parliament, follows  the ordinary legislative procedure (ex-codecision procedure) (European Council, Council of the European  Union, n.d.) (European Parliament, n.d.).  Europol Regulation  The legal framework for the European Union Agency for Law Enforcement Cooperation (Europol) was set in  Regulation 2016/794 (European Parliament and Council of the European Union, 2016e) adopted in May  2016, replacing and repealing previous Council Decisions concerning Europol (Decisions 2009/371/JHA,  2009/934/JHA, 2009/935/JHA, 2009/936/JHA and 2009/968/JHA). Europol assists the Member States in  fight against serious international crime and terrorism.  In 2013 Europol set up the European Cybercrime Centre (EC3). EC3’s goal is to strengthen the law  enforcement response to cybercrime in the EU. In fighting against cybercrime EC3 serves as the central hub  Improving Cooperation between CSIRTs and Law Enforcement: Legal and Organisational Aspects  Version 1.0  |  November 2017  30  for criminal information and intelligence, supports operations and investigations by Member States. It offers  operational analysis, coordination and its considerable expertise, provides a variety of strategic-analysis  products that enable informed decision-making at the tactical and strategic levels on combating and  preventing cybercrime. EC3 supports also training and capability-building in Member States and provides  technical and digital forensic support capabilities to investigate and operations.  Relevant ECJ Case Law  Case law from the Court of Justice of the European Union (ECJ) is also relevant for the CSIRTs and LEAs  cooperation. There is case law related to the concept of personal data, jurisprudence on IP addresses and  data retention.  An example is the ECJ Judgment of 6 November 2003 in Case 101/2001 - Lindqvist (Court of Justice of the  European Union, 2003) where the Court endorsed a broad approach to the concept of personal data: “The  term personal data used in Article 3(1) of Directive 95/46 covers, according to the definition in Article 2(a)  thereof, any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person” (par. 24).  Concerning IP addresses, an important ECJ Judgement is that of the 24 November 2011 in Case 70/10  Scarlet v. SABAM (Court of Justice of the European Union, 2011). According to it, “an Internet Service  Provider (ISP) could not be compelled to install a filtering system for all electronic communications, both  incoming and outgoing, passing via its services and aimed at detecting and preventing an unlawful  exchange of copyrighted works”.  In its recent judgement of 19 October 2016 related to Case 582/14 – Patrick Breyer v. Germany (Court of  Justice of the European Union, 2016), the ECJ refers to its judgement in case 70/10, by stating that “As a  preliminary point, it must be noted that, in paragraph 51 of the judgment of 24 November 2011, Scarlet  Extended (C‑70/10, EU:C:2011:771), which concerned inter alia the interpretation of the same directive,  the Court held essentially that the IP addresses of internet users were protected personal data because  they allow users to be precisely identified” (par. 33) but that such “finding by the Court related to the  situation in which the collection and identification of the IP addresses of internet users is carried out by  internet service providers (par. 34). In Judgement in case 582/14, the Court ruled that “Article 2(a) of  Directive 95/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24 October 1995 on the protection of  individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data must be  interpreted as meaning that a dynamic IP address registered by an online media services provider when a  person accesses a website that the provider makes accessible to the public constitutes personal data  within the meaning of that provision, in relation to that provider, where the latter has the legal means  which enable it to identify the data subject with additional data which the internet service provider has  about that person.”  Also ECJ case law in the field of data retention is relevant when discussing cooperation between CSIRTs and  LEAs.  The Directive 2006/24/EC (European Parliament and Council of the European Union, 2006) - no longer in  force - was related to the retention of data generated or processed in connection with the provision of  publicly available electronic communications services or of public communications networks and amended  Directive 2002/58/EC (European Parliament and Council of the European Union, 2002). The Judgment in  Joined Cases C-293/12 and C-594/12 Digital Rights Ireland and Seitlinger and Others (Court of justice of the  European Union, 2014), of 8 April 2014 of Grand Chamber, declared Directive 2006/24/EC invalid because  of the breach of the principle of proportionality. This is for various reasons, including, in particular, the  following:  Improving Cooperation between CSIRTs and Law Enforcement: Legal and Organisational Aspects  Version 1.0  |  November 2017  31   Directive 2006/24/EC did not require any relationship between the retained data and a threat to public  security. This Directive did not foresee restrictions to a particular time period and/or a particular  geographical zone. Moreover, it did not foresee restrictions to persons that could be involved, in one  way or another, in a serious crime, or to persons who could, for other reasons, contribute, by the  retention of their data, to the prevention, detection or prosecution of serious offences (see par. 59).   Directive 2006/24/EC did not provide any objective criterion aimed at determining the limits of the  access of the competent national authorities to the data and their subsequent use for the purposes of  prevention, detection or criminal prosecutions concerning offences. In general, in case of offence, a  national authority can interfere with the fundamental rights enshrined in Articles 7 and 8 of the  Charter only if the extent and seriousness of the offence are so high to justify this. Each directive  should be harmonised with the Charter (see par. 60).   Moreover, Directive 2006/24/EC did not provide any objective criterion that could guarantee that the  number of persons authorised to access and process the data retained is limited to what is strictly  necessary.   Furthermore, Directive 2006/24/EC did not provide substantive and procedural conditions about the  access to the data and the related processing by the competent national authorities (see par. 61). In  addition, the Directive was inadequate from the perspective of management of data retention period.   Finally, it should be pointed out that the Directive did not establish that the acquired data are kept  only in the territory of the European Union (see par. 68).  Also the Judgment of the Court of Justice (Grand Chamber) of 21 December 2016, in Joined Cases C-203/15  and C-698/15 (Court of Justice of the European Union, 2016), Tele2 Sverige AB v Post- och telestyrelsen and  Secretary of State for the Home Department (UK) v Tom Watson and Others, has potential interest for  CSIRTs who carry out the processing of personal data in connection with the provision of publicly available  electronic communications services in public communications networks.  The ECJ in this Judgement clarified that the measures related to the retention of data for the purpose of  combating crime also fall within the scope of Directive 2002/58/EC in the light of the general structure of  this Directive (see par. 73). In addition, it stated that every access of the competent national authorities to  retained data requires a prior review carried out either by a court or by an independent administrative  body, except in cases of validly established urgency (see par. 120).  The above mentioned ECJ case law concerns relevant issues such as IP addresses as personal data. This  jurisprudence does not specifically address cooperation between CSIRTs and LEAs however it is discussed  in this report as an example of case law that might be relevant also in the field of CSIRT-LE cooperation.  Some Article 29 Working Party Relevant Opinions  Opinions of Article 29 Data Protection Working Party might be relevant too when discussing cooperation  between CSIRTs and LEAs.  An example is Opinion 4/2007 (Article 29 Data Protection Working Party, 2007), adopted on 20 June 2007,  analysed the concept of personal data. In this regard, the opinion recalled the definition of personal data  contained in the Directive 95/46/EC (European Parliament and Council of the European Union, 1995) and  referred to the broad approach interpretation endorsed by the ECJ in Case 101/2001 - Lindqvist (Court of  Justice of the European Union, 2003) mentioned above.  The opinion proposes a balanced solution. On the one hand, it recalled that European legislator adopts a  wide notion of “personal data”. On the other hand, it stated that the scope of the data protection rules  should not be overstretched. In this opinion is stated that “unless the Internet Service Provider is in a  position to distinguish with absolute certainty that the data correspond to users that cannot be identified,  Improving Cooperation between CSIRTs and Law Enforcement: Legal and Organisational Aspects  Version 1.0  |  November 2017  32  it will have to treat all IP information as personal data, to be on the safe side” (Article 29 Data Protection  Working Party, 2007, p. 17).  National Legal and Policy Framework for the Cooperation between CSIRTs and LEAs  Also the national legal and policy frameworks govern and shape the cooperation between CSIRTs and LEAs.  Transposition of the international and European law is an important component of the national criminal  law and criminal procedure law. There might be however some specificities in legislative provisions  depending on the country.  EU Cybersecurity Policy Funding Initiatives and EU Instruments to Support Cyber Security  Collaboration at International Scale  Among the EU funding initiatives in the field of cybersecurity (for an overview see: (European Commission,  2017c)), we can mention: Horizon 2020 (H2010) programme (European Commission, n.d. b) “to pursue  cybersecurity research and innovation under the contractual public-private partnership on cybersecurity  for the period 2017-2020” (European Commission, 2017c); Connecting Europe Facility (CEF) (European  Commission, n.d. c), dedicated to the Digital Service Infrastructures (DSIs), cybersecurity being one of the  areas supported under the DSIs stream within the CEF (MeliCERTes facility for instance, which “aims to  facilitate swift and effective operational cooperation” for the CSIRTs Network (European Commission,  2017e) is an example of project conducted in the context of CEF); and the Internal Security Fund (ISF) to  “promote the implementation of the Internal Security Strategy, law enforcement cooperation and the  management of the Union's external borders” (European Commission, n.d. d).  In addition, there are some EU-instruments that play a role in support of the cyber security collaboration at  international scale, such Instrument contributing to Stability and Peace (IcSP) (European Commission, n.d.  e), European Neighbourhood Instrument (ENI) (European Union External Service, 2017) and Instrument of  Pre-accession (IPA) (European Commission, n.d. f).  Improving Cooperation between CSIRTs and Law Enforcement: Legal and Organisational Aspects  Version 1.0  |  November 2017  33  4. Challenges in the Cooperation between CSIRTs and LEAs  According to the data collected via the online survey, during the incident handling/investigation CSIRTs and  LEAs often share information. See Figure 6.  Figure 6 - Frequency of Information Sharing between CSIRT-LE During Incident Handling/Investigation, According to Data  Collected Via the Online Survey  According to the data collected, in addition to building trust, there are some challenging aspects related to  the cooperation between CSIRTs and LEAs. These can be classified into legal, organisational, and technical  challenges. Figure 7 presents all these challenges.  Figure 7 – Overview of Challenging Aspects of the CSIRTs-LEAs Cooperation According to the Data Collected via the Online  Survey  - Clustered Columns  Improving Cooperation between CSIRTs and Law Enforcement: Legal and Organisational Aspects  Version 1.0  |  November 2017  34  While overall for the CSIRTs and LEAs, the legal aspects represent the most challenging aspects of the  cooperation, if we look at the aggregated replies on aspects representing the “highest challenge” and a “high  challenge”, we can observe that the organisational aspects are considered as the biggest challenge.  According to the replies received from the online survey, the technical aspects are the smallest concern. See  Figure 8 below.  Figure 8 - Overview of Challenging Aspects of the CSIRTs-LEAs Cooperation According to the Data Collected via the Online  Survey  - Stacked Columns  Legal Challenges  Below some legal challenges highlighted during the interviews are addressed. They belong mainly to two  groups of challenges. First there are challenges related to the EU legislation under implementation. The  second are those challenges which are related to the diversity in the national legal systems.  Relevant EU Legislation Currently Under Implementation  First, the transitions’ period (periods during which an EU directive is transposed into Member States’  national law) represents a challenge: during the transition period efforts and adjustments to new legal  settings are required. Second, there are some challenges related to the implementation of specific pieces  of legislation itself.  4.1.1.1 NIS Directive  Article 9 of the NIS Directive (European Parliament and Council of the European Union, 2016a) states that  “Each Member State shall designate one or more CSIRTs which shall comply with the requirements set out  in point (1) of Annex I [requirements and tasks of CSIRTs], covering at least the sectors referred to in Annex  II [i.e. energy, transport, banking, financial market infrastructures, health, drinking water supply and  distribution, digital infrastructure] and the services referred to in Annex III [online marketplace, online  Improving Cooperation between CSIRTs and Law Enforcement: Legal and Organisational Aspects  Version 1.0  |  November 2017  35  search engine, and cloud computing service], responsible for risk and incident handling in accordance with  a well-defined process”.  One issue is that the spectrum of sectors in the NIS Directive is the minimum spectrum of sectors of  operators of essential services, in other words, the list of sectors of essential services in the NIS Directive is  not an exhaustive one. Moreover, the implementation of the NIS Directive could change the constituency  of the current national/governmental CSIRTs and this might impact the current cooperation between LEAs  and CSIRTs within the counties.  In addition, as provided in Article 2, par. 2 (a), the NIS Directive “lays down obligations for all Member  States to adopt a national strategy on the security of network and information systems”, in other words to  adopt a “framework providing strategic objectives and priorities on the security of network and  information systems at national level” (see Article 4 (3)). Most countries have already complied with this  provision; however, a few still need to adopt such strategy to comply by the set deadline to the NIS  Directive.  Finally, the NIS Directive anticipated that “Each Member State shall designate one or more national  competent authorities on the security of network and information systems” (see Article 8, par. 1) and  “have adequate resources to carry out, in an effective and efficient manner, the tasks assigned to them  and thereby to fulfil the objectives of this Directive” (see Article 8, par. 5). Similar provisions (see Article 9,  par. 2) in terms of resources are foreseen for the CSIRTs covering at least the sectors of essential services  mentioned in Annex II and services in Annex III (see above). This means that Member States need to have  adequate resources reserved to give an effective implementation to the NIS Directive and contribute to  reach the achievement of “a high common level of security of network and information systems within the  Union so as to improve the functioning of the internal market” (see Article 1).  4.1.1.2 LEA Data Protection Directive  The main challenge in the implementation of the LEA Data Protection Directive is related to the cost factor.  In order to ensure the right to the protection of personal data, the Directive provides for a number of  obligations for the data controllers. Inevitably, the fulfilment of these obligations implies costs in terms of  both staff and technical means. This could be a possible reason for resistance by data controllers to the  application of the Directive in the processing of personal data.  4.1.1.3 GDPR  The GDPR (European Parliament and Council of the European Union, 2016b) shall apply from 25 May 2018  (see Article 99 - Entry into force and application).  From the interviews conducted, the issue of IP addresses as personal data was not identified as a challenge  for the CSIRTs and LEAs cooperation. According to the data collected, IP addresses are usually considered  as personal data and treated as such. It is however important that the Member States make the right  application of the GDPR, in particular Article 23 (providing restrictions to data protections law in certain  situations and under certain circumstances) and take in due account the Recital 49 (legal ground in  processing of personal data by CSIRTs).  The retention of data and IP addresses as personal data could become an issue for the CSIRTs community  and could cause serious issues in cybercrime investigation. This is why the Member States should be very  specific in using the restriction provided in Article 23 and in applying the GDPR also in the light of Recital  49. Without that, the cooperation between CSIRTs and LEAs could become tougher. This could also impact  the CSIRTs community by making the information exchange more formalised affecting the agile culture of  CSIRTs.  Improving Cooperation between CSIRTs and Law Enforcement: Legal and Organisational Aspects  Version 1.0  |  November 2017  36  Diversity of the Legal Framework between Member States  Finally, there are the challenges related to the variety of legal systems and legal provisions in the Member  States. These challenges are particularly important. First, an event might be considered as a crime in one  country, while in another country it is not a crime. Secondly, there is a problem related to the data  retention. The diversity of conservation times between the various Member States represents a serious  problem in terms of the effectiveness of the fight against crime.  Organisational Challenges  The world of ICT is constantly evolving, because of this the challenges faced in communication between  CSIRTs and LEAs are also constantly changing. The following challenges should be recognised and  discussed.  Limitations in Skills and Availability of Specialised Personnel  A major challenge is related to the available human resources. This is because, in some cases, the CSIRTs  and LEAs have limited specialised personnel to meet actual needs. Generally, interviews have shown that,  especially in time of high workload, the number of CSIRT/LEA personnel is not enough to facilitate their  cooperation, including their communication.  Insufficient Training  Training, including publicly available online training resources, supports the development of skills within  the CSIRTs community and law enforcement community. Such training is generally targeting either the  CSIRTs - see for instance (ENISA, n.d. d) - or the LEAs, rarely both. Most of the time CSIRTs and LEAs do not  perform common training, thus they do not have the chance to form a common ground and use the same  tools, methods and terminology.  Training should concern technical but also legal and organisational aspects of the information sharing  between CSIRTs and LEAs. According to the data collected, not always do personnel receive sufficient  training on legal and organisational matters and in most cases personnel does not receive refresher  training on possible new legislative developments.  Lack of Defined and Agreed Procedures for the Information Sharing between CSIRTs and LEAs  Another important challenge is the lack of defined procedures to fulfil the obligation to share. As emerged  from the interviews, both CSIRT and LEAs sometime are lacking defined procedures, e.g. the CSIRTs to  identify whether an incident is likely to be a crime, and the LEAs to provide information to CSIRTs.  Need for a Better Knowledge of Recognised International Standards  A further challenge is the need for a better knowledge of standards relevant in the area of cooperation  between CSIRTs and LEAs. There are indeed several standards, such as some standards developed by ETSI,  ISO, and NIST, that play/could play a role in facilitating the cooperation between CSIRT and LEAs. However,  in order for CSIRTs and LEAs to take advantage from the existing standards for further enhancing their  cooperation, they need to have a better knowledge of such standards and their implementation.  Need for Building and Maintaining Trust between CSIRTs and LEAs  The mutual trust seems to be the main success factor determining the cooperation between CSIRTs and  LEAs. The vast majority of the online survey participants agreed that the most important success factor in  the cooperation between CSIRT and LEAs is trust (72%): 84% of the CSIRT community, 63% of LEA  community. In Figure 9 an overview is provided on most important success factor according to the  responses to the online survey.  Improving Cooperation between CSIRTs and Law Enforcement: Legal and Organisational Aspects  Version 1.0  |  November 2017  37  Figure 9 – Most Important Success Factor in the Cooperation between CSIRTs and LEAs According to Data from the Online  Survey  Knowing each other, understanding the culture of the other side (CSIRTs for LEAs and vice versa) and  building mutual trust by working together on many cases and various occasions, have a significant impact  on overall cooperation and collaboration within these two communities. It takes a while to build the  mutual trust and to understand restrictions and culture of the other community (LEAs for CSIRTs and vice  versa). For this reason, the personal relations are very important.  As emerged from the desk research and from the interviews, building and maintaining trust is a process  that requires investment of resources and time. Moreover, turnover of personnel, especially of those who  play the role of liaison officers, is a challenge for the cooperation between CSIRTs and LEAs because trust  building requires time and investment also in establish and maintain good personal relations.  Technical challenges  In this report technical aspects, including technical challenges, of cooperation between CSIRTs and LEAs  are addressed only very briefly. More information can be found in the ENISA report on Tools and  Methodologies to Support Cooperation between CSIRTs and Law Enforcement (ENISA, 2017).  Keeping Information Systems and Tools Up-to-Date  A first technical challenge concerns the need for a continuous software update. The need to continuously  upgrade the IT equipment involves a further challenge, related to the adequacy of the resources available  to CSIRTs and LEAs. Interviews have shown that such resources are not always available but some  economic weaknesses can be overcome thanks to the goodwill between the CSIRT and LEA personnel who,  in many cases and under the condition that it is legal, spontaneously share both software and information.  Improving Cooperation between CSIRTs and Law Enforcement: Legal and Organisational Aspects  Version 1.0  |  November 2017  38  Differences in the Modalities in Data Transmission  A second technical challenge identified concerns the need to overcome the different technical modalities  used by the various CSIRTs and LEAs for data transmission between them. This diversity is due to the fact  that CSIRTs and LEAs have different purposes. CSIRTs aim to counteract incidents, while LEAs aim to catch  the criminal.  Differences in Toolkit Used  The toolkit that is used is also very different between CSIRTs and LEAs. The former are more inclined to use  open-source tools and create custom ones. The latter usually need to have commercial, somehow verified  or acknowledged tools, so that the result of their analysis is by no means questioned in the court of law.  Improving Cooperation between CSIRTs and Law Enforcement: Legal and Organisational Aspects  Version 1.0  |  November 2017  39  5. Conclusions and Recommendations  Conclusions  Using the analysis of the results collected from the desk research, the interviews with subject-matter  experts, and the online survey, a number of trends have become clear, more specifically regarding:   CSIRTs and LEAs have different roles and objectives   CSIRTs and LEAs often share information, both formally and informally   Trust is a key factor for the information sharing   Legal frameworks and organisational challenges to the cooperation can further be worked out in a way  that cooperation between the two communities is further facilitated  Different Roles and Objectives  CSIRTs and LEAs have different but complementary roles and operate in different ways.  There is clear evidence that there are strong synergies between both communities. Findings from the  interviews have found that CSIRTs operate more on an informal basis, while LEAs are generally bound by a  more procedural approach of following rules and a hierarchical authority.  Information Sharing  CSIRTs and LEAs share often information both formally and informally. There is a lack of defined and  agreed procedure for the information sharing. CSIRTs and LEAs use a variety of methods and tools for the  representation and classification of data regarding incidents and events.  Trust  It is clear from the data collected that trust is of paramount importance for both CSIRTs and LEAs when it  comes to information sharing. Trust is seen as an enabler while a lack of trust is seen as a challenge in turn  hindering cooperation. In particular, the issue of reputational damage for a party involved in information  exchange seems to be a significant concern which has an impact on the information exchange between  both parties.  Trust is a process, not a state, which means that it is an ongoing effort that should be always sought and  strengthened. Confidence building measures, cooperation and building of mutual interests between the  two communities are key elements.  Legal Frameworks and Organisational Challenges  The data collected showed that there are challenges around the variety of legal systems and legal  provisions in the Member States. One challenge to be considered is that an incident considered as a crime  in a country, might not be a crime in another country. Furthermore, issues arise around data retention,  and in particular the diversity of data retention periods between the various Member States. This seems to  represent a serious problem in terms of the effectiveness to fight crime.  According to the data collected, there is a need for a better knowledge of standards relevant in the area of  cooperation between CSIRTs and LEAs. Indeed, in order for CSIRTs and LEAs to take advantage from the  existing standards for further enhancing cooperation, the knowledge of such standards and their  implementation by both parties should be enhanced.  In addition to the key points outline above, it is clear that training should concern technical but also legal  and organisational aspects of the information sharing. Training and skills development should cover  Improving Cooperation between CSIRTs and Law Enforcement: Legal and Organisational Aspects  Version 1.0  |  November 2017  40  changes or developments in the legal and policy framework relevant for the cooperation between CSIRTs  and LEAs, including their communication.  Recommendations  In order to further improve the cooperation, including the communication, between CSIRTs - mainly  national/governmental - and LEAs, some specific recommendations related to legal/organisational aspects  of their cooperation are proposed.  It must be noted that these recommendations have been developed based on the data and results of this  report as well as of the parallel ENISA report on Tools and Methodologies to Support Cooperation between  CSIRTs and Law Enforcement (ENISA, 2017).  The recommendations below are as much as possible focused on CSIRT-LEA cooperation; they should be  seen as additional to other more general and high level recommendations like to balance privacy and  security, or promote, where appropriate, harmonisation of criminal law among the Member States.  Place Liaison Officers on Both Ends and Facilitate Coordination Among Liaison Officers Across  Europe  It could be very useful to establish liaison officers within each organisation - LEA personnel into  national/governmental CSIRTs and CSIRT personnel into LEAs. This would be beneficial in the process of  trust building between CSIRTs and LEAs and in the process of providing reciprocal feedback. Placing  officers from national/governmental CSIRT within LEAs and vice versa (LEA officers in  national/governmental CSIRTs) would be of support for the development of a more uniformed approach to  collaboration and information sharing.  Recommendation for:   ENISA: to collect successful case studies of cooperation that has been enhanced by the presence of  liaison officers and share them with CSIRTs and LEAs communities, propose a list of main requirements  and tasks for liaison officers as well as models for liaison officers’ appointment (e.g. via secondment,  etc.)   ENISA: to propose ways for facilitating the liaison officers’ coordination across Europe   National/governmental CSIRTs and LEAs: to identify liaison officers (LEA officers in  national/governmental CSIRTs and vice versa)   Member States: to foresee the role of the liaison as a translator between both parties and allocate  resources for liaisons at national/governmental CSIRTs and LEAs   ENISA and Europol’s EC3: to propose a role description for liaison officers and models for such  placement, in order to get a more uniform approach in the different Member States   ENISA and Europol’s EC3: to collect information on the working procedures of the liaisons and review  them regularly  Formalise Intelligence Exchange  To establish a mechanism for monthly intelligence exchange between CSIRTs and LEAs, that would be also  accompanied with the relevant and agreed statistics, would be of help for fighting against cybercrime. In  addition, this will also help in trust building.  Recommendation for:   CSIRTs and LEAs: to collect data and share them as much as they can and as much as they are allowed  to   CSIRTs and LEAs: to develop a methodology on how data quality can be evaluated (and improved)  Improving Cooperation between CSIRTs and Law Enforcement: Legal and Organisational Aspects  Version 1.0  |  November 2017  41   CSIRTs: to make the Traffic Light Protocol (TLP) more well-known outside CSIRT community, especially  to the LEA community   ENISA and Europol’s EC3: to maintain and publish statistics of their respective constituencies (so other  can learn from trending)   CSIRTs and LEAs Liaisons Officers: to assist in simplifying the information exchange process and work  out relevance check procedures before sharing, and review them regularly  Simplify and Standardise the Forms for Data Requests and the Procedures to Share Information  Between CSIRTs and LEAs  To develop and to use the same forms for data requests from/to CSIRTs and LEAs and vice versa would  improve the cooperation. The forms should be developed in a way that they are in line with the common  taxonomy for CSIRTs and LEAs (Europol - European Cybercrime Centre, n.d.) - a new version of the  common taxonomy for CSIRTs and LEAs is expected to be released at beginning of 2018. Regarding  common taxonomy for CSIRTs and LEAs see (ENISA, 2015a), (ENISA, 2017). The forms should contain fields  for as a minimum all the information included in the taxonomy and should clearly indicate whether the  information received can be passed to other actors (e.g. other CSIRTs) involved in the  investigation/incident handling.  Recommendation for:   CSIRTs and LEAs: to articulate their requirements regarding how these forms and procedure should be  used   ENISA and Europol’s EC3: to collect the requirements from the CSIRTs and LEAs regarding the forms  and the procedures, to develop and propose standardised forms and standardised procedures to be  adopted by the CSIRTs and LEAs communities   ENISA and Europol’s EC3: to promote the adoption of standardised forms and procedures   CSIRTs and LEAs: to adopt and use standardised forms and standardised procedures for their  information sharing  Further Invest in CSIRT-LEA Joint Training and in Skills Development  The creation of joint training and skills development between CSIRTs and LEAs would help share existing  practices but will also allow the development of collaborative approaches in the future.  Good training plays a central role in improving the cooperation, including communication, of CSIRTs and.  ENISA and Europol’s EC3, possibly together with CEPOL, should work to extend the ENISA training material  for the law enforcement operations. In addition, joint training for CSIRTs and LEAs should be facilitated.  Those training materials should focus mainly on mutual understanding of languages used by both CSIRTs  and LEAs. There should be common understanding of legal the technical matters, including challenges  faced by one or by both communities.  There should be joint exercises based on actual cases, where CSIRTs and LEAs will practice jointly fighting  cybercrime.  If standardised forms for data exchange between CSIRTs and LEAs are developed and standardised  procedures made available, they should also be covered during the training too. The training should also  focus on (personal) data processing.  CSIRT and LEA senior management should also promote common training sessions; this can be carried out  e.g. through conferences and access to virtual library. It is important to develop the awareness that such a  joint training is necessary. Therefore, it should not be conceived as occasional, but instead continuously  Improving Cooperation between CSIRTs and Law Enforcement: Legal and Organisational Aspects  Version 1.0  |  November 2017  42  scheduled at regular intervals. In addition, it is important to ensure the quality of training through the  involvement of highly qualified individuals and the use of suitable material, including the one freely  accessible on the ENISA site.  Recommendation for:   National/governmental CSIRTs and national law enforcement training centres: to organise CSIRT-LEA  joint training   ENISA and Europol’s EC3, possibly together with CEPOL: to extend the ENISA training material to be  fitted for the law enforcement work   ENISA and Europol’s EC3, possibly together with CEPOL: to facilitate joint training for CSIRTs and LEAs   CSIRTs and LEAs: to provide the training requirements to the facilitators of the joint training   CSIRTs and LEAs: to participate in the joint training  Further Invest in Networking Events and Trust-Relationships between CSIRTs and LEAs  Events at national and EU level that bring together both CSIRTs - in particular national/governmental - and  LEAs helps not only to improve their contacts and provide reciprocal feedback, but also to provide them  with the opportunities to identify synergies and ways to further improve their cooperation. Some of such  events are already organised at national level. At EU level, an annual workshop for CSIRTs and LEAs is  organised jointly by ENISA and Europol’s EC3. This kind of events should be continued and further  promoted. Online meetings and seminars should be also considered.  Recommendation for:   Member States: to organise – or where already existing – continue to organise such events for their  CSIRTs - in particular national/governmental - and the LEAs at national level   ENISA and Europol’s EC3: to facilitate the setting-up of sessions and side-events dedicated to CSIRTs  and LEAs cooperation during CSIRTs (e.g. FIRST, TF-CSIRT) and LEAs conferences   ENISA and Europol’s EC3: to continue organising events for the CSIRTs - in particular  national/governmental and for the LEAs at EU level, to create and consolidate contacts, and to  enhance trust   CSIRTs and LEAs: to actively participate in the events with both technical teams and liaison officers and  engage in an open discussion towards a further enhanced cooperation   ENISA: to compile studies addressing aspects of cooperation between CSIRTs and LEAs and delving  deeper into specific issues of their cooperation  Effectively Implement the NIS Directive and Apply the GDPR  In 2016 the EU put into force two important pieces of legislation, the NIS Directive and the GDPR. The  effective implementation of the NIS Directive and application of GDPR will have positive effect on the  common understanding between CSIRTs and LEAs in regard to the legal aspects of their work, and on their  cooperation.  The NIS Directive aims at achieving a high common level of security of network and information systems  across the Union. Legislators should work to transpose this directive into national law as soon as possible,  in the view of the deadline of the 9 May 2018. Moreover, ENISA should provide reports on the  implementation of this directive. In order to ensure any shortcomings are addressed, these reports should  focus on both successes and challenges.  On the other hand, the GDPR is a Regulation which aims to harmonise the data privacy laws across Europe,  and to better safeguard EU citizens’ privacy. As discussed earlier in this report (see 3.2.9.2), Recital 49 of  the GDPR sets the legal ground for the processing of personal data by CSIRTs. As a regulation, it is directly  Improving Cooperation between CSIRTs and Law Enforcement: Legal and Organisational Aspects  Version 1.0  |  November 2017  43  effective in Member States; however, it leaves room in certain occasions for Member States to legislate.  For that reason, and since the GDPR will apply starting from 25 of May, 2018, Member States should work  on national laws to cover those needs, as well as to promote the compliance of all affected entities to the  GDPR. Similar to the NIS Directive, ENISA should provide reports on the application of GDPR, focusing on  successes and challenges.  Recommendation for:   EU Member States: to organise at national level events to promote the NIS Directive, and its effective  implementation within country   EU Member States: to organise at national level events to promote the GDPR, and its effective  application within country   ENISA: to analyse the implementation of the NIS Directive and the application of the GDPR focusing on  successes as well as challenges to ensure that any shortcomings are addressed  Clearly Identify Which Information CSIRTs and LEAs Are Allowed/Obliged to Share between  Them under the Current Legal Framework  To enhance the cooperation between CSIRTs and LEAs, it would be beneficial to have a clear identification  of which information CSIRTs and LEAs are allowed/obliged to share between them under the current legal  framework. This would help to point out possible legislative gaps and, accordingly, if appropriate, take  actions to fill these gaps.  Recommendation for:   Member States: to conduct studies to clearly identify which information under the current legal  framework CSIRTs and LEAs are allowed/obliged to share between them and possible legislative gaps  in their jurisdiction in relation to CSIRTs and LEAs cooperation   CSIRTs, in particular national CSIRTs, and LEAs: whenever they identify a need for new legislation or  for a change in the current legislation governing their cooperation, to express such need via their  formal and informal channels   ENISA: to collect data from the Member States and present an overview of which information CSIRTs -  in particular national/governmental CSIRT - and LEAs can/are obliged to share between them under  the current legal framework  Have in Place Legislation that Well Define Under Which Conditions CSIRTs and LEAs are  Allowed/Obliged to Share Information Between Them and their Accountability When They  Share and Reply to the Requests (CSIRT to LEA/LEA to CSIRT), as well as Reflect on Turning  Information Sharing Between (National) CSIRTs and LEAs Mandatory  To further enhance the cooperation between CSIRTs and LEAs, is also important for members of those  teams to have well-defined obligations and accountability to share information. This would also stimulate  discussion at Member State level about the nature of information sharing, and ultimately conclude if  information sharing, especially between national/governmental CSIRTs and LEAs, should be turned to  mandatory (where it is not already mandatory).  Recommendation for:   Member States: to have in place legislation that well define under which condition CSIRTs and LEAs are  allowed/obliged to share and their accountability when they share information between them and  reply to the requests (CSIRT to LEA/LEA to CSIRT), as well as to reflect on turning information sharing  between (national/governmental) CSIRTs and LEAs mandatory (where it is not mandatory already)  Improving Cooperation between CSIRTs and Law Enforcement: Legal and Organisational Aspects  Version 1.0  |  November 2017  44   Member States: to reflect on turning information sharing between (national) CSIRTs and LEAs  mandatory   European Commission and ENISA: to assist the Members States by developing model legislation to  govern and support CSIRTs and LEAs cooperation  Promote a Culture of Information Sharing Between CSIRTs and LEAs Within the Country and  Cross-Border  Apart from the legal obligations for sharing and the standardisation of the form of requests that were  described above, information exchange is also a culture that should be promoted between CSIRTs and  LEAs. Best practices as well as use cases that information exchange assisted the efficient resolution of an  incident/crime within the country of cross-border can be used as a basis for creating or further improving  an information sharing mind-set among members of law enforcement and incident response teams.  Recommendation for:   ENISA: to develop material specifically to promote the culture of information sharing between CSIRTs  and LEAs.   Member States: to use ENISA material as well as specific use cases in order to create or further  improve a sharing mind-set between LEAs and CSIRTs  Promote the Improvement of Maturity of LEAs and CSIRTs in Order to Better Facilitate the  Information Sharing  The maturity of an organisation in terms of people, processes and technology is an important factor of the  ability of the organisation to share information efficiently with other parties. For CSIRTs there are already  several maturity models which are used as an audit base for the acceptance of a team in closed groups  that focus on information sharing; an example is the ENISA online maturity assessment (ENISA, n.d. b). On  CSIRT maturity see: (ENISA, n.d. a), (ENISA, 2015c), (ENISA, 2017c), and (ENISA, 2016c)  The data collected did not provide any indication that similar models currently exist for the law  enforcement. The formulation of maturity models for LEAs would give them the chance to compare and  improve their capabilities based on commonly accepted standards, and thus reach and prove a level of  maturity that would make information exchange with CSIRTs easier.  Recommendation for:   ENISA: to promote the importance of maturity improvement and of maturity models   Europol’s EC3: to develop a maturity model for LEAs, similar to CSIRT models, that would describe  people, processes and technology parameters based on which LEAs could measure and improve their  maturity level   Europol’s EC3: to disseminate the maturity model to Member States LEAs and provide assistance on  the way that it can be used for measurement and improvement of their maturity   Member States: to promote the use of maturity models by their CSIRTs - in particular  national/governmental - and LEAs for the improvement of their capabilities, with the view of further  enhancing the cooperation between CSIRTs and LEAs  Develop Internal Security Policies Permitting and Supporting Information Sharing with  CSIRTs/LEA Counterpart  It is important that the internal security policies of CSIRTs allow as much as possible the information  sharing with the law enforcement and vice versa. So, when developing new internal security policies, both  Improving Cooperation between CSIRTs and Law Enforcement: Legal and Organisational Aspects  Version 1.0  |  November 2017  45  CSIRTs and LEAs should take this into account in order not to run the risk that information sharing  permitted by law might be hindered at the level of internal security policies.  Recommendation for:   CSIRTs and LEAs: when developing their internal security policy to shape them in a way that they do  not represent an obstacle to the information sharing with their CSIRT/LEA counterpart.  5.2.12 Make Available and Take Advantage of CSIRTs Dataset, Expertise and Contacts  CSIRTs can enrich LEAs intelligence that would be useful for LEAs investigations/prosecutions. LEAs could  have access to CSIRTs data via Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) and thus enrich their own  investigation data.  Practical examples of datasets that could be shared between CSIRTs and LEA are: annotation services for IP  addresses such as Passive DNS, Passive SSL; public information leaks; datasets about crawled information  from the darknet; and measurements based on backscatter in case of distributed denial of service attacks.  In addition, CSIRTs can provide technical expertise during LEAs investigations when needed/requested. The  CSIRTs network of contacts can be very useful during LEAs investigations.  Recommendation for:   ENISA and Europol’s EC3: to work out procedures on how the trust relationship CSIRT-constituency  can be maintained when allowing LEA access to datasets   ENISA and CSIRTs: to develop methodologies to support LEAs coordination with CSIRTs during  investigations   CSIRTs: to provide enrichment services to LEAs for their investigations   CSIRTs: to provide technical expertise during law enforcement investigation upon request   CSIRTs: to provide access to their network of contacts to LEAs for their investigations   LEAs: to make use of CSIRTs dataset, expertise and contacts and LEAs provide feedback on the quality  of the dataset, expertise and contacts.

Collaboration between  Computer Security Incident Response Teams (CSIRTs) and Law Enforcement Agencies (LEAs) is key for  finding such information and for fighting against cybercrime.  A number of attacks that recently hit critical sectors brought an increased level of cooperation, partly out  of necessity, Wannacry (ENISA, 2017a) and ‘NotPetya’ (an updated version of Petya) attacks (Europol,  2017a) being the most recent examples. The legal and organisational aspects are an important component  for the cooperation.  This report aims to support the cooperation between CSIRTs - in particular national/governmental CSIRTs -  and LEAs in their fight against cybercrime, by providing information on the legal and organisational  aspects, identifying current shortcomings, and formulating and proposing recommendations on legal and  organisational aspects to further enhance the cooperation.  The data for this report was collected via desk research, interviews with subject-matter experts, and an  online survey.  The data collected confirmed that CSIRTs and LEAs often exchange information during the incident  handling/investigations, both formally and informally, and that trust is the key success factor for the  cooperation. However, it is clear that there are challenges related to the variety of legal systems and legal  provisions in the different Member States. Adding further complexity is the diversity of communication  channels between the various Member States that represents an issue in terms of the effectiveness to  fight crime.  Core recommendations to improve legal and organisational aspects of the cooperation in particular  between national/governmental CSIRTs and LEAs include:   CSIRTs and LEAs should place liaison officers on both ends and ENISA should propose ways to  facilitate the liaison officers’ coordination;   CSIRTs and LEAs, with the support of ENISA and Europol’s EC3, should formalise intelligence exchange;   CSIRTs and LEAs should adopt and use simplified standardised forms for data requests and simplified  standardised procedures for their information sharing;   National/governmental CSIRTs and national law enforcement training centres, with the support of  ENISA and Europol’s EC3, should further invest in CSIRT-LEA training and skills development;   Member States, ENISA and Europol’s EC3 should further invest in networking events and trust- relationships between CSIRTs and LEAs;   ENISA should analyse the implementation of the NIS Directive and the application of GDPR focusing  on successes as well as challenges to ensure that shortcomings are addressed;   Member States should clearly identify which information CSIRTs and LEAs are allowed/obliged to  share between them under the current legal framework;   Member States should have in place legislation that well define under which conditions CSIRTs and  LEAs are allowed/obliged to share and accountability when they share, as well as reflect on turning  information sharing between (national) CSIRTs and LEAs mandatory;  Improving Cooperation between CSIRTs and Law Enforcement: Legal and Organisational Aspects  Version 1.0  |  November 2017  08   Member States, with the support of ENISA, should promote a culture of information sharing between  CSIRTs and LEAs within the country and cross-border;   Member States, ENISA and Europol’s EC3, should promote the improvement of maturity of LEAs and  CSIRTs in order to better facilitate the information exchange;   CSIRTs and LEAs should develop internal security policies permitting and supporting information  sharing with CSIRT/LEAs counterpart;   CSIRTs, with the support of ENISA and Europol’s EC3, should make available and LEAs take advantage  of CSIRTs dataset, expertise and contacts.  In parallel to this report, ENISA has published a complementary report on Tools and Methodologies to  Support Cooperation between CSIRTs and Law Enforcement (ENISA, 2017), which focuses on technical  aspects and which is available on the ENISA website.  Improving Cooperation between CSIRTs and Law Enforcement: Legal and Organisational Aspects  Version 1.0  |  November 2017  09  1. Introduction  Purpose  The purpose of this report on Improving Cooperation between CSIRTs and Law Enforcement: Legal and  Organisational Aspects is to understand the legal and organisational aspects of the cooperation between  Computer Security Incident Response Teams (CSIRTs) and Law Enforcement Agencies (LEAs), including of  their communication.  While this report focuses on the legal and organisational aspects, some considerations are also made  about the technical aspects. However, the technical aspects of this cooperation are addressed in more  detail in the ENISA report on Tools and Methodologies to Support Cooperation between CSIRTs and Law  Enforcement (ENISA, 2017).  Background of the Report  The ENISA Programming Document 2017-2019 (ENISA, 2017b) includes “Objective 4.2. - CSIRT and NIS  community building”. Under Objective 4.2, “Output 4.2.1 - Support the fight against cybercrime and  collaboration between CSIRTs and LEA” has the goal to “to build upon the progress ENISA has made in  supporting different operational communities (e.g. CSIRT, law enforcement, European FI-ISAC) to enhance  mutually satisfactory ways to collaborate and support good practices among different stakeholders in  operational communities in Europe” (ENISA, 2017b, p. 52).  This report contributes to the implementation of Output 4.2.1, in particular to what is foreseen as “Further  improvement of communication between CSIRTs and LEA (based on 2011 report ‘Flair for Sharing’)”  (ENISA, 2011a).  Report Objectives and Scope  Report Objectives  The main objectives of this report are to:   Provide information on legal and organisational aspects of the cooperation between CSIRTs - especially  national/governmental CSIRTs - and LEAs, in particular of their communication;   Identify current1 challenges - mainly legal and organisational ones - that CSIRTs and LEAs face in their  cooperation to fight against cybercrime;   Formulate and propose recommendations to enhance mutually satisfactory ways of cooperation,  including communication, within the current legal framework and to further improve, if needed, the  legal framework for the cooperation and the organisational aspects of it.  Report Scope  The geographical coverage of this report is limited to the EU (European Union, 2017) and EFTA (EFTA, n.d.)2  countries. This does not mean however that all these countries are covered in the report and that no  reference to other countries outside EU and EFTA is made therein.  1 Cut-off date for this report: 1 November 2017.  2 In this report “n.d.” stands for “no date” and it is used in the references when no date could be found for the cited  source.  Improving Cooperation between CSIRTs and Law Enforcement: Legal and Organisational Aspects  Version 1.0  |  November 2017  10  The report does not target a specific sector; considerations made can apply to cooperation between CSIRTs  and LEAs to fight against cybercrime in all sectors (from finance to energy, from transport to health).  The area of the fight against terrorism is outside the scope of this report, although many of the developed  considerations can be extended to it.  Concerning CSIRTs, the report focuses in particular on national/governmental ones.  Target Audience  The intended target audience are CSIRTs - mainly national/governmental CSIRTs but not limited to them -,  LEAs, and in general public and private organisations with an interest in NIS.  Additionally, policy and law makers may benefit from select aspects of analysis as well as  recommendations of this report, as they prepare policies and legislation for the purpose of enhancing the  cooperation between the two important communities in fighting cybercrime, being CSIRTs and LEAs.  Key Concepts and Definitions  In the context of this report, the following definitions – below listed in alphabetical order – apply:   Challenge refers to “a situation that poses difficulties, a situation where one or more than one  obstacle is present and need to be overcome/removed, and where determination is required” (Portesi,  2008). In this report challenges – as well as the aspects of the cooperation - are grouped in “legal”,  “organisational” and “technical”.   Classification (of events or incidents) “is designed to group related things together and to define the  relationship these things have to each other [… (ENISA, 2011b)]. In addition, classification is the  repartition of events and incidents into classes, not to be confused with the level of classification of a  document [… (ENISA, 2015a)]” (ENISA, 2016a, p. 59).   Communication in most cases refers to the information sharing between CSIRTs and LEAs. Sometimes  the term “communication” is also used in its legal sense of “policy document with no mandatory  authority” (European Judicial Network, n.d.), such as the Commission Communication on  Strengthening Europe's Cyber Resilience System (European Commission, 2016). In a few cases it refers  to the transmitted information or – especially when in plural – to a system used to transmit the  information. Communication is an essential component of the cooperation between CSIRTs and LEAs.   Computer Security Incident Response Team (CSIRT) or Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT)  is “an organisation that studies computer and network security in order to provide incident response  services to victims of attacks, publish alerts concerning vulnerabilities and threats, and […] offer other  information to help improve computer and network security”. At present, “both terms (CERT and  CSIRT) are used in a synonymous manner, with CSIRT being the more precise term” (ENISA, 2015b, p.  7) (ENISA, 2015a, p. 12) (ENISA, 2016b, p. 10).   Cooperation and collaboration here are synonymous in this document. They refer to the joint work of  CSIRTs and LEAs, their coordination of actions, their reciprocal help and their joining efforts to fight  against cybercrime.   Criminal investigations “refers to the investigatory phase beginning with a police officer becoming  aware of the fact that criminal activity is going to be committed or has been committed and it ends  when the case is solved” (Portesi, 2008, p. 109) and/or closed.   Cybercrime is an umbrella term. An unequivocal definition of cybercrime does not exist. In general we  refer by it to “Any offense where the modus operandi or signature [which refers to “the mental and  emotional motivations” (Geberth, 1995)] involves the use of a computer network in any way” (Casey,  2004, p. 667). Cybercrime includes both crimes where computer is an object (e.g. illegal access to an  information system) or a tool (e.g. storage of illegal images on a computer device or usage of a  Improving Cooperation between CSIRTs and Law Enforcement: Legal and Organisational Aspects  Version 1.0  |  November 2017  11  computer to plan a murder) of crime. It must be noted that “While many aspects of cybercrime are  firmly established, other areas of cybercrime have witnessed a striking upsurge in activity, including  attacks on an unprecedented scale, as cybercrime continues to take new forms and new directions”  (Europol, 2017).   Governmental CSIRTs are teams whose constituency are the public administration networks. Currently  “in the EU, governmental CSIRTs are typically used to protect the cyberspace of governmental  institutions including critical infrastructure as well as to ensure cyber-crisis management” (ENISA,  2015c, p. 9).   Information sharing refers to “the exchange of a variety of network and information security related  information such as risks, vulnerabilities, threats and internal security issues as well as good practice”  (ENISA, 2010, p. 9).   Incident is “any event having an actual adverse effect on the security of network and information  systems” (European Parliament and Council of the European Union, 2016a).   Incident handling refers to “all procedures supporting the detection, analysis and containment of an  incident and the response thereto” (European Parliament and Council of the European Union, 2016a).   Law enforcement and Law Enforcement Agencies (LEAs) are terms used in this report as synonymous  and they refer to “agencies responsible for maintaining public order and enforcing the law, particularly  the activities of prevention, detection, and investigation of crime and the apprehension of criminals”  (BJS, n.d.)   Legal aspects refer to the dimensions of the CSIRT-LEA cooperation that relate to the rules and policies  shaping and governing it, including obligations, discretion, prohibition to share information in their  effort to fight against cybercrime.   Malware Information Sharing Platform (MISP) is an “Open Source Threat Intelligence Platform &  Open Standards for Threat Information Sharing” (MISP, 2017) and it is “a combination of a community  of members, a knowledge base on malware and a web-based platform” (NATO NCI Agency).   Methodology is a term used in this report with two main meanings. First, in its meaning in research, it  refers to which kind of data are collected (e.g. qualitative or quantitative) and how (i.e. methods of  data collection; see for example Chapter 2 - Methodology). Second, in the sense of ways how CSIRTs  and LEAs share information in their joint effort to fight against cybercrime.   National CSIRT: a CSIRT that “acts as national point of contact (PoC) for information sharing (like  incident reports, vulnerability information and other) with other national […] CSIRTs in the EU Member  States and worldwide. National […] CSIRT can be considered as “CERT of last resort”, which is just  another definition of a unique national PoC with a coordinating role. In a lot of cases a national […]  CSIRTs also acts as governmental […] CSIRT. Definitions may vary across the EU Member States”  (ENISA, 2009, p. 8).   National cyber security strategy or national strategy on the security of network and information  systems refers to the “framework providing strategic objectives and priorities on the security of  network and information systems at national level” (European Parliament and Council of the European  Union, 2016a).   Network and information system refers to “(a) an electronic communications network […]; (b) any  device or group of interconnected or related devices, one or more of which, pursuant to a program,  perform automatic processing of digital data; or (c) digital data stored, processed, retrieved or  transmitted by elements covered under points (a) and (b) for the purposes of their operation, use,  protection and maintenance” (European Parliament and Council of the European Union, 2016a).   Organisational aspects refer to those dimensions of the CSIRT-LEA cooperation that relate to steps  taken, procedures followed, resources available, etc. in their cooperation to fight against cybercrime.   Practices refers to “something that is usually or regularly done, often as a habit, tradition, or custom”  (Cambridge University Press, n.d.).  http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/regularly http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/habit http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/tradition http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/custom  Improving Cooperation between CSIRTs and Law Enforcement: Legal and Organisational Aspects  Version 1.0  |  November 2017  12   Standard: in a very broad sense means refers to something normally used or widely accepted. “In  simple terms, a standard is a document that provides rules or guidelines to achieve order in a given  context” (ETSI, n.d.). “Standards are produced for many different products and services, and may be  created for company, national, regional or global application. They may be used on a voluntary basis,  or made mandatory by company policy, national or international regulation, or by law.  In Europe there are three different categories of standard:   international standard – a standard adopted by an international standardisation organisation   European standard – a standard adopted by a European standardisation body   national standard – a standard adopted by a national standardisation body and made available to  the public” (ETSI, n.d.).   Taxonomy “is defined as a classification of terms. Three characteristics define a taxonomy:   a form of classification scheme to group related things together and to define the relationship  these things have to each other;   a semantic vocabulary to describe knowledge and information assets; and   a knowledge map to give users an immediately grasp of the overall structure of the knowledge  domain covered by the taxonomy, which should be comprehensive, predictable and easy to  navigate” (ENISA, 2016a, p. 7).  “There is currently no consensus on concepts and definitions related to taxonomies” (ENISA, 2016a, p.  5).   Technical aspects refer to the dimensions of the CSIRT-LEA cooperation that relate to the tools (e.g.  applications, the platforms) and the methodologies used by CSIRTs and LEAs to share information in  their effort to fight against cybercrime.   Traffic Light Protocol (TLP) “is a means for someone sharing information to inform their audience  about any limitations in further spreading this information. It is used in almost all CSIRT communities  and some Information Analysis and Sharing Centres (ISACs). The TLP can be used in all forms of  communication, whether written or oral. […] The TLP is in principle easy to use: the sharer of  information tags the information with a colour. Tagging information consists simply of adding  “TLP:COLOUR” [Red, Amber, Green, White] on a document or part of it. The meaning of the colour  indicates the possibilities for further spreading of the information. Over the years, different wordings  of the TLP have surfaced, but the CSIRT community recently made an effort to clarify the TLP.” “Since  the TLP’s use is ubiquitous in certain communities, it would be easy to think that it is the ultimate  solution for sharing information. It is not. The TLP’s use of four categories is simple, if not simplistic.  There will always be cases where it is not suited to the situation at hand. For example, a presentation  in a meeting of representatives of CSIRTs could be TLP:RED for most of them, except for the one team  present who is able to act on the information, for whom TLP:AMBER would be more suitable. It is  possible to build more complicated examples ad libitum, where the only way out is old-fashioned,  extensive, distribution lists. This does not mean that the TLP is useless. On the contrary, its simplicity  and universality make it ideal for many real-life situations. It is just not a silver bullet” (ENISA, n.d.).  Improving Cooperation between CSIRTs and Law Enforcement: Legal and Organisational Aspects  Version 1.0  |  November 2017  13  2. Methodology  To collect data for this report mainly a qualitative methodological approach has been adopted: indeed, due  to the rather new field addressed, primarily qualitative research has been conducted, in other words a  “Research for the purpose of developing “sensitizing concepts” [- which are “directions along which to  look” (Blumer, 1954, p. 7) -] and verstehen (understanding) rather than quantitative measurement”  (Hagan, 1997, p. 510).  However, some quantitative data has also been collected: an online survey has been conducted to validate  and complement the findings from the desk research and the interviews. The quantitative research carried  out allowed the collection of some “data in the form of numbers” and produced some simple “Descriptive  statistics that includes frequency distributions such as rates, proportions, and percentages as well as  graphic representations of data such as pie charts […and] bar graphs” (Bayens & Roberson, 2011, p. 25).  Information Collection Instruments Used  Desk Research  A first desk research was conducted based on publicly available information sources, including ENISA  publications. The findings from this desk research were particularly useful also for drafting of the  questionnaire to support the interviews.  In addition to the material listed in Chapter 6 - Bibliography/References, examples of sources consulted  and of material reviewed collected during the desk research can be found in Annex D: Samples of Material  Collected During the Desk Research Not Included in the Bibliography/References.  A supplementary desk research was conducted to address specific topics that the project team deemed  appropriate to examine in more depth following the analysis of the data collected via the interviews. These  included areas such as incident handling, information sharing taxonomies, information sharing tools and  platforms, information sharing groups and initiatives, legislation and policies.  The findings from the desk research were particularly useful also for the drafting of the questionnaire to  support the interviews.  Interviews  Structured interviews were conducted with four CSIRT representatives from three Member States and with  five LEA representatives from three Member States. The interviews were conducted during the period  from May 2017 and July 2017. They were mainly conducted via phone and they lasted each around ninety  minutes. Interviewees received the questions in advance and in most cases they had the opportunity to  review the notes taken by the interviewers (project team) with their replies.  Two questionnaires were prepared to support the interviews, one for the interviews with the CSIRTs, one  for the interviews with the LEA (see Annex B: Samples of Questionnaires to Support the Interviews). Some  questions were open questions; most were yes/no questions. For all questions, including yes/no,  interviewees could add comments and additional information.  May-June 2017 was a particularly challenging period to meet interviewees availably, not least because of  their engagement in responding to incidents such as WannaCry and ‘NotPetya’ ransomware attacks.  Some data collected for the report on technical aspects mentioned above were also used to complete and  validate the data collected for this report.  Improving Cooperation between CSIRTs and Law Enforcement: Legal and Organisational Aspects  Version 1.0  |  November 2017  14  Online Survey  An online survey was conducted to collect additional data to validate and further substantiate some  findings. It was composed of eight questions (see Annex C: Questions in the Online Survey), all with closed  answers and some with the possibility to add additional comments and provide more details related to the  answers. Several rounds of testing took place. The estimated time to fill in the online survey was less than  ten minutes.  The survey was developed by using the EUSurvey, a survey tool which is “supported by the European  Commission's ISA programme, which promotes interoperability solutions for European public  administrations” (European Commission, n.d. a).  The invitation to fill the survey was sent to the closed ENISA mailing list of European national and  governmental CSIRTs, which includes around forty-five teams. In addition, it was sent via Europol to the  European Union Cybercrime Task Force (EUCTF), which is “composed of the Heads of the designated  National Cybercrime Units throughout the EU Member States and Europol” (Council of the European  Union, 2017a, p. 13).  The survey was launched in August 2017 and was open for around two weeks. The data collected via the  online survey was used to validate the data collected through the desk research and interviews and also to  produce some simple statistics.  Twenty-five replies were received: thirteen respondents were from CSIRT community, eleven from the law  enforcement community and one belonged to both areas. An overview of the composition of the  respondents based on the community they belong to is presented hereinafter in Figure 1.  Figure 1 – Overview of Respondents to the Online Survey Based on the Community They Belong to  Twenty-three respondents were from nineteen of the twenty-eight EU Member States (European Union,  2017), two respondents were from EFTA countries (EFTA, n.d.).  Most respondents replied to all questions, despite most questions not being mandatory. Some  respondents used the comment box to provide extra information.  Improving Cooperation between CSIRTs and Law Enforcement: Legal and Organisational Aspects  Version 1.0  |  November 2017  15  Data Used to Develop the Recommendations  The recommendations in Chapter 5.2 have been developed based on research findings and the results of  this report as well as of the parallel ENISA report on Tools and Methodologies to Support Cooperation  between CSIRTs and Law Enforcement (ENISA, 2017).  Selection and Classification of the Stakeholders  This research was carried out in order to understand how the cooperation, in particular communication,  between the two mentioned communities can be further improved. This is aimed at supporting the fight  against cybercrime and collaboration between CSIRTs and LEAs, as envisaged by the ENISA Programming  Document 2017-2019 (ENISA, 2017b).  The stakeholders selected for the interviews were:   First, CSIRTs, mostly, national CSIRTs and governmental CSIRTs. However, in order to better  understand how communication between CSIRTs and LEAs really works, some CSIRTs have been  interviewed, which were neither national CSIRTs nor governmental CSIRTs;   Second, LEAs, in particular national LEAs from different European Union countries, were interviewed.  However, some local LEAs were also interviewed for a better understanding of the local realities.  The key stakeholders for this report are all CSIRTs and LEAs exchanging data between each other. Additional  report recipients are legislators and all those who can define policies and procedures for improving  communication between CSIRTs and LEAs.  Contribution by Subject Matter Experts  ENISA selected four external subject-matter experts from the List of NIS Experts compiled following the  ENISA Call for Expression of Interest (CEI) (Ref. ENISA M-CEI-17-T01), who contributed to this report ad  personam by supporting the data collection and analysis. These experts contributed inter alia to the report  with their legal expertise in NIS (including but not limited to policy monitoring activities, legal framework  relevant to the information sharing, and digital forensics) and their expertise in NIS aspects of cybercrime  and in incident response.  In addition to ENISA internal reviewers and project team reviewers, some external experts/organisations  peer-reviewed this report (or part of it) and their feedback were incorporated in the final draft.  Improving Cooperation between CSIRTs and Law Enforcement: Legal and Organisational Aspects  Version 1.0  |  November 2017  16  3. Overview of the Policy Context  Some General Remarks Regarding the Cooperation between CSIRTs and LEAs  Below follow some preliminary remarks related to the context surrounding the cooperation between  CSIRTs and LEAs to fight against cybercrime.  Not all Incidents Are Cybercrimes and Not All Cybercrimes Are Incidents  In the absence of an unequivocal definition of cybercrime, in general by it we can refer both to crime  having a computer as a target and crimes where computer is a tool to commit traditional or news crimes.  By “incident” is meant “any event having an actual adverse effect on the security of network and  information system” (Article 7 (7) of the NIS Directive (European Parliament and Council of the European  Union, 2016a)).  On the one hand, there might be accidental unforeseeable events that have an adverse effect on the  security of a system and that can be considered as incidents. However, because they are not intentional  and could not be even foreseen, in principle, they cannot be considered as a cybercrime. On the other  hand, crimes where computer is merely a tool (e.g. storage of illegal images on a computer or using a  computer to plan a murder) can be considered in a broad sense as cybercrime, but they are not defined as  incidents.  Cooperation between CSIRTs and LEAs Does Not Take Place for All Cybercrime Cases  There are some cases where cooperation between CSIRTs and LEAs does not take place. For example,  because the crime under police investigations involves computers but it is not an incident (see 3.1.1). The  other example is when an incident is not reported as a crime, for instance, because the victim is afraid of  possible reputational damages, or does not know how and to whom to report it.  CSIRT and LEAs are Different as Well as Their Objectives  CSIRTs focus on preventing and mitigating incidents and, as highlighted in previous ENISA’s studies CSIRTs  “compared to the investigatory character of LEAs […] [CSIRTs] operate on an informal basis [see (ENISA,  2011a)], which allegedly permits them to be agile in their response” (ENISA, 2012, p. 27). By comparison,  LEAs are generally bound by a formal procedural approach of following rules and a hierarchical authority  for the purpose of supporting criminal investigations and the producing evidence to be used before a Court  of Law. This is partly due to the different objectives that each community is trying to achieve but it is also  bound up with discreet features of each community. LEAs are for instance driven by Penal Law procedures  because of the sort of standards that pervade their work (e.g. in maintaining the evidential chain,  motivating and often justifying decisions, adhering to the framework concerning the rights of investigated  parties, etc.) (ENISA, 2012, p. 27). When investigations end before a court, a clear path is required to justify  the way evidence has been collected in a way that and legal objections of the suspect and her defence can  be successfully confronted. Apart from that, LEAs work as any other hierarchical organization where  usually justification of decisions may need to take place.  CSIRTs and LEAs, and Other Actors  CSIRTs and LEAs are not the sole actors when it comes to cope with cybercrime. Their cooperation in  fighting cybercrime is accompanied by other actors and usually there is also interaction of CSIRTs and LEAs  with other entities, there are several other actors that are part of the scene, such as:   The criminal - or more correctly as far as he/she is not sentenced - the suspect;   The victim, which can be an individual, a company, or a private organisation;  Improving Cooperation between CSIRTs and Law Enforcement: Legal and Organisational Aspects  Version 1.0  |  November 2017  17   The judiciary, in other words, public prosecutors and judges who come to play their important role in  cases where the conditions to prosecute are met;   The telecommunication operators;   The internet service providers;   The systems and network administrators (e.g. of the victim, of third persons or even of the criminal),  that might have important pieces of information to support not only the incident handing but also the  crime investigation;   The IT security companies, that provide information and solutions, in some cases even in real time  during the incident mitigations and criminal investigations;   The insurance companies, with which the victims might have stipulated insurances to cover  cybercrime damages;   The national cyber security authorities (e.g. cyber security centres);   The intelligence community;   The military;   The subject-matter experts who might belong to one of the organisations mentioned in this list or may  act as individuals;   The CSIRTs Network that as provided in Article 12 of the NIS Directive (European Parliament and  Council of the European Union, 2016a) is “composed of representatives of the Member States' CSIRTs  and CERT-EU” and other national, supranational and international CSIRTs networks, ISACs and fora  (e.g. FIRST, TF-CSIRT, and European FI-ISAC);   The malware and threat information sharing groups, including MISP project (MISP Project, n.d.).   ENISA that provides the Secretariat of the CSIRTs Network and actively supports the cooperation  among the CSIRTs and, together with Europol’s EC3, the cooperation between CSIRTs and LEAs;   Europol’s European Cybercrime Centre (EC3) set in 2013 by Europol “to strengthen the law  enforcement response to cybercrime in the EU and thus to help protect European citizens, businesses  and governments from online crime” (European Cybercrime Centre - EC3, n.d.);   The international law enforcement agencies, including INTERPOL (INTERPOL, n.d.);   Academia;   Other stakeholders, for instance, subjects other than those mentioned above that might be affected  by the incident handling/cybercrime response: examples are clients of the victims (for instance when  the victim, for instance a bank or an electricity company, provide services) or other subjects somehow  sharing – even involuntarily and unaware of the crime – hardware and software with the criminal.  Variety of CSIRTs, LEAs, and Ways of Cooperating  Services offered, consistency, size and maturity level vary considerably from CSIRT to CSIRT.  National and governmental CSIRTs play particularly important roles: “Currently in the EU, governmental  CSIRTs are typically used to protect the cyberspace of governmental institutions including critical  infrastructure as well as to ensure cyber-crisis management. National CSIRTs, on the other hand, are  playing different roles in different countries. In some countries they are responsible for the whole IP  address space of that country, in others they also take the role of ‘last resort’ when no security contact  point for an IP address can be found. In any case, when another country has to be contacted regarding  solving an incident, national CSIRTs are often asked to help to find the right contact person. Increasingly  CSIRTs expect other teams with comparable competences to react to their requests in a timely manner and  to handle shared information professionally” (ENISA, 2015c, p. 9).  In many European countries there are also sectorial CSIRTs. They handle incidents and assist in particular  critical sectors (e.g. finance, health, energy). Their constituency is about the sector as a whole.  Improving Cooperation between CSIRTs and Law Enforcement: Legal and Organisational Aspects  Version 1.0  |  November 2017  18  Like for CSIRTs, there are many kinds of LEAs. For instance, there are local, federal, national, supranational  and international LEAs. Also responsibilities and powers might vary from LEA to LEA. There are LEAs that  are specialised in cybercrime investigations. Also size and resources of LEAs might be quite different from  LEA to LEA and, in general, depending on the country.  The overall cooperation between CSIRTs and LEAs is affected by the type of CSIRT and LEA involved, and  whether liaison officers are appointed or not.  CSIRTs and LEAs share information both formally (e.g. in the context of an official written request for  information regarding a specific case) and informally (e.g. when information is shared orally during an  informal phone call). Both formal and informal channels require a legal basis and either type of  information sharing between CSIRTs and LEAs need to be in line with applicable legislation.  The level and sophistication of information shared depends also on the level of formalisation of the  cooperation between CSIRTs and LEAs.  According to the results from the online survey shown in Figure 2, CSIRTs and LEAs share mainly three  types of information: malicious campaign and context information, IP addresses, and information on the  modus operandi of the attacker and indicators of compromise (IOC).  Figure 2 - Information Shared Formally between CSIRTs and LEAs according to the Online Survey  In addition to formal information sharing, CSIRT and LEAs share information informally.  According to the results from the online survey shown in Figure 3, most information shared informally are  indicators of compromise (IOC), malicious campaigns and context information, IP addresses, statistics and  reports on cases dealt with and on trends, and information on modus operandi of the attacker.  Improving Cooperation between CSIRTs and Law Enforcement: Legal and Organisational Aspects  Version 1.0  |  November 2017  19  Figure 3 - Information Shared Informally According to the Online Survey  Figure 4 provides some compared data regarding which data are shared formally and informally.  Figure 4 - Comparison Between Kind of Information Shared Between CSIRTs and LEAs Formally and Informally, According to the  Data Collected Via the Online Survey  According to the data collected via the online survey, personal information (other than IP addresses) does  not often seem to be the object of information sharing between CSIRTs and LEAs, neither formally nor  informally.  Improving Cooperation between CSIRTs and Law Enforcement: Legal and Organisational Aspects  Version 1.0  |  November 2017  20  According to the data collected via the interviews, two different levels of cooperation between the CSIRTs  and LEAs can be identified:   A cooperation at higher level via the liaison officer (when there is a liaison office). At this higher level  the general framework of the cooperation is set but the actual materialisation of this framework is  often ad hoc, depending on the case   Ad hoc specific cooperation is the cooperation between the CSIRT and LEA personnel working on the  specific case dealt with  Level of formalities might also vary depending on the level of cooperation and on the country. The second  level of cooperation is almost always facilitated by the liaison office, if present, and a result of the first  level of cooperation.  Importance of Reciprocal Feedback  As it emerged both from the interviews and the online survey, feedback represents an important element  to improve the cooperation between CSIRTs and LEAs. See Figure 5.  Figure 5: Overview of How Much Feedback Would Improve the Cooperation Between CSIRT and LE, According to the Data  Collected Via the Online Survey  Main Legal and Policy Framework for the Cooperation between CSIRTs and LEAs  The legal and policy context plays an important role in governing and shaping the cooperation between  CSIRTs and LEAs in fighting against cybercrime. The section hereinafter describes some of the most  relevant international and EU legislation and policies in the field.  It is worth mentioning the need for technology-neutral laws. On the one hand, the cybercrime landscape is  changing very fast; on the other hand, it usually takes a long time to create a piece of legislation, especially  in the case of international law. This is why it is extremely important to create such legislative solutions  which will be efficient not only today, but also in five and ten years’ time or more.  Improving Cooperation between CSIRTs and Law Enforcement: Legal and Organisational Aspects  Version 1.0  |  November 2017  21  Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime (“Budapest Convention”)  The Council of Europe (CoE) (Council of Europe, n.d.) was established in 1949 to uphold and strengthen  human rights, democracy and the rule of law within Europe. The Council consists of forty-seven Member  States, including all the Members of the European Union.  In 1995 the CoE presented a report concerning the adequacy of criminal procedures laws in the area of  computer-related threats and hacking. Following this initiative, in 1997 the Committee of Experts on Crime  in Cyberspace was established to prepare a convention which could facilitate international cooperation in  the investigation and prosecution of computer crimes. The Convention on Cybercrime was opened for  signature in Budapest, Hungary, in November 2001.  The Convention on Cybercrime (ETS No. 185) (Council of Europe, 2001) (Council of Europe, n.d. a), also  called the “Budapest Convention”, is the first international treaty and remains the most relevant  international treaty on cybercrime and electronic evidence. It requires Parties to criminalise offences  against and by means of computers in their domestic criminal law (Articles 2 to 11), to provide their law  enforcement with the necessary powers to secure electronic evidence not only in relation to cybercrime  but any crime entailing evidence on a computer systems (Articles 16 to 21) – while making these powers  subject to rule of law safeguards (Article 15), and to engage in international cooperation on cybercrime  and electronic evidence (Articles 23 to 35).  The Cybercrime Convention Committee (T-CY) representing the Parties to this treaty assesses the  implementation of the treaty, issues Guidance Notes and may also prepare additional protocols to the  Convention. The European Union (including the European Commission and the Council of the European  Union, Eurojust, Europol and ENISA) are observers in this Committee.  The Convention is not only open to the Members of the CoE but any country committed and able to  implement this treaty may accede. By October 2017, fifty-six States – European countries but also  Australia, Canada, Chile, Costa Rica, Dominican Republic, Japan, Senegal, Sri Lanka, USA and others – had  been Parties and a further fourteen had signed it or been invited to accede. All EU Member States had  signed the Convention, and all except for two had also ratified it. The Chart of signatures and ratifications  of the Convention is available on the Council of Europe website (Council of Europe, n.d. b).  The Additional Protocol to the Convention on Cybercrime, concerning the criminalisation of acts of a racist  and xenophobic nature committed through computer systems (ETS No.189) of 28 January 2003 “entails an  extension of the Cybercrime Convention’s scope, including its substantive, procedural and international  cooperation provisions, so as to cover also offences of racist or xenophobic propaganda. Thus, apart from  harmonising the substantive law elements of such behaviour, the Protocol aims at improving the ability of  the Parties to make use of the means and avenues of international cooperation set out in the Convention  […] in this area” (Council of Europe, n.d. c).  As also mentioned in the recent Joint Communication on Resilience, Deterrence and Defence: Building  strong cybersecurity for the EU (European Commission and High Representative of the Union for Foreign  Affairs and Security Policy, 2017), “A possible addition of a protocol to the Convention is now being  explored [ (Council of Europe Cybercrime Convention Committee, 2017)], which could also provide a useful  opportunity to address the issue of cross-border access to electronic evidence in an international context.  Rather than the creation of new international legal instruments for cybercrime issues, the EU calls for all  countries to design appropriate national legislation and pursue cooperation within this existing  international framework”. The negotiation of such a Protocol commenced in September 2017 and is  expected to be completed by December 2019.  Improving Cooperation between CSIRTs and Law Enforcement: Legal and Organisational Aspects  Version 1.0  |  November 2017  22  Directive on Attack Against Information Systems  The Directive on attacks against information systems (European Parliament and Council of the European  Union, 2013), replacing Council Framework Decision 2005/222/JHA (Council of the European Union, 2005),  entered into force in August 2013 and its implementation deadline was in September 2015. This Directive  integrated elements of the Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime (Council of Europe, 2001).  The Directive was an important step in the EU’s effort to create the European rules to combat cybercrime.  According to the Directive there are four main substantive offences (together, the “Substantive Offences”)  of:   Illegal access to information systems   Illegal system interference   Illegal data interference; and   Illegal interception.  The Directive also increases the cooperation between competent authorities to enable a response to urgent  information requests with a response time of no more than eight hours and also to monitor and record  statistical data and report on cybercrime offences and criminal convictions.  As foreseen according to the Directive, the European Commission has compiled a report assessing the  extent to which the Member States have taken the necessary measures in order to comply with this  Directive. This report was published on 13 September 2017 (European Commission, 2017a).  Europe 2020, the Digital Agenda for Europe (DAE), Digital Single Market Strategy for Europe  (DSM), and the Cyber Security Strategy (CSS)  3.2.3.1 Europe 2020  In June 2010, ten-years strategy EUROPE 2020 A strategy for smart, sustainable and inclusive growth  (European Commission, 2010a) from the European Commission was issued. It sets objectives for the  growth of the European Union. One of the pillars was the Digital Agenda.  3.2.3.2 Digital Agenda for Europe  Launched in May 2010, A Digital Agenda for Europe (DAE) (European Commission, 2010b) is the action plan  for Europe for making the best use of information and communication technologies (ICT) so that the  sustainable digital future could be build. The main goal of the document was to take actions which will  remove obstacles to maximising the potential of ICTs, with long-term investments to minimise future  problems. The Digital Agenda “is aimed at boosting Europe’s economy by delivering sustainable economic  and social benefits from a digital single market” (European Commission, 2014).  3.2.3.3 Digital Single Market Strategy for Europe (DSM Strategy)  Creating the Digital Single Market is one of the seven goals of the Digital Agenda. As the continuation of  this policy, in May 2015, A Digital Single Market Strategy for Europe (European Commission, 2015a) was  adopted. It contains a number of initiatives, the implementation of which should open up digital  opportunities for people and business and enhance Europe’s position as a world leader in the digital  economy.  There are three pillars of the DSM Strategy:  1. Better access for consumers and business to online goods (helping to make the EU’s digital world a  seamless and level marketplace to buy and sell)  Improving Cooperation between CSIRTs and Law Enforcement: Legal and Organisational Aspects  Version 1.0  |  November 2017  23  2. The right environment for digital networks and services (designing rules which match the pace of  technology and support infrastructure development)  3. Economy and Society (ensuring that Europe’s economy, industry and employment take full advantage  of what digitalisation offers)  “Trust and security are at the core of the Digital Single Market Strategy, while the fight against cybercrime  is one of the three pillars of the European Agenda on Security” (European Commission, 2015b). Without  these two elements the European Union could not create right environment for digital economy to grow.  The Commission leads a big number of projects whose aim is to boost internet trust and security.  In May 2017 the Commission has published the mid-term review of the DSM Strategy (European  Commission, 2017b), which took stock of the progress made and called on co-legislators to swiftly act on  all proposals already presented, as well as outlines further actions on online platforms, data economy and  cybersecurity.  3.2.3.4 Cyber Security Strategy (CSS) and Joint Communication on Resilience, Deterrence and Defence  As one of the initiatives of the DSM Strategy supporting the Digital Agenda, in 2013 European Commission  presented the Cybersecurity Strategy of the European Union: An Open, Safe and Secure Cyberspace  (European Commission and High Representative of the European Union for Foreign Affairs and Security  Policy, 2013). It was the first strategic document on the European level which only referred to  cybersecurity. The document sets out the EU's approach on best preventing and responding to cyber  disruptions and attacks. The Strategy also emphasises that fundamental rights, democracy and the rule of  law need to be protected in cyberspace.  Achieving cyber resilience and drastically reducing cybercrime are given as strategic priorities and actions.  To do it, it was recognised that the effective cooperation between public authorities and the private sector  is absolutely crucial. The strategy also stressed that the national NIS competent authorities should  collaborate and exchange information with other regulatory bodies.  In September 2017 the European Commission and the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affiairs  and Security Policy presented the Joint Communication on Resilience, Deterrence and Defence: Building  strong cybersecurity for the EU (European Commission and High Representative of the Union for Foreign  Affairs and Security Policy, 2017). Three main goals for Europe are identified as:  1. Building EU resilience to cyberattacks  2. Creating effective EU cyber deterrence  3. Strengthening international cooperation on cybersecurity  Public-private cooperation against cybercrime is named as one of the most important activity’s in the field  of creating effective EU cyber deterrence. It is underlined that “cooperation with the private sector,  including industry and civil society, is fundamental for public authorities to fight crime effectively”  (European Commission and High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, 2017).  The financial sector was pointed as an example of such cooperation (addressing online fraud and  cybercrime). It is also emphasised that “private undertaking need to be able to share information on  concrete incidents with law enforcement – including personal data – in full respect of data protection  rules” (European Commission and High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy,  2017).  The public-private cooperation in the field of fighting cybercrime accentuates the need of cooperation  between LEA and CSIRT established in different sectors such as finance, energy or telecommunication. This  creates new challenges, since every sector has its own specificities and CSIRT constituency might be  Improving Cooperation between CSIRTs and Law Enforcement: Legal and Organisational Aspects  Version 1.0  |  November 2017  24  different from sector to sector. The NIS Directive requires the establishment of CSIRTs for so called  essential services operators (more about NIS Directive in the next section).  NIS Directive  The Directive (EU) 2016/1148 concerning measures for a high common level of security of network and  information systems across the Union (European Parliament and Council of the European Union, 2016a) (so  called “NIS Directive”) was adopted in July 2016. The initial project of the NIS Directive was presented  jointly with the European Cybersecurity Strategy in 2013 (European Commission and High Representative  of the European Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, 2013).  The NIS Directive “lays down measures with a view to achieving a high common level of security of  network and information systems within the Union so as to improve the functioning of the internal  market” (Article 1). The NIS Directive creates the culture of security across sectors which are vital for our  economy and society and moreover rely heavily on ICTs, such as energy, transport, water, banking,  financial market infrastructures, healthcare and digital infrastructure. Businesses in these sectors that are  identified by the Member States as operators of essential services will have to take appropriate security  measures and to notify serious incidents to the relevant national authority. Also key digital service  providers (search engines, cloud computing services and online marketplaces) will have to comply with the  security and notification requirements under the NIS Directive.  The NIS Directive provides obligations for all Member States to adopt a national cyber security strategy  and to designate national competent authorities, single points of contact and CSIRTs with tasks related to  the security of network and information systems. Both the operators of essential services and the digital  service providers are required to report the incidents. In addition, they are also required to take  appropriate and proportionate technical and organisational measures to manage the risks posed to the  security of network and information systems which they use in their operations.  The NIS Directive also creates a new mechanism for cooperation among all the Member States. This  cooperation will take place within the Cooperation Network, which is composed of the Cooperation Group  and the CSIRTs Network. The Cooperation Group supports and facilitates strategic cooperation and the  exchange of information among Member States. The CSIRTs Network supports and promotes promote  swift and effective operational cooperation on specific cybersecurity incidents and sharing information  about risks.  The CSIRTs Network already proved its effectiveness during two large scale incidents: WannaCry and  ‘NotPetya’.  Communication on Strengthening Europe's Cyber Resilience System and Recommendation on  Coordinated Response to Large Scale Cybersecurity Incidents and Crises (“Blueprint”)  The Communication from the European Commission on Strengthening Europe's Cyber Resilience System  and Fostering a Competitive and Innovative Cybersecurity Industry (European Commission, 2016) was  presented in July 2016.  It has three goals:  1. Stepping up cooperation to enhance preparedness and deal with cyber incidents  2. Addressing challenges facing Europe’s cybersecurity Single Market  3. Nurturing industrial capabilities in the field of cybersecurity  Improving Cooperation between CSIRTs and Law Enforcement: Legal and Organisational Aspects  Version 1.0  |  November 2017  25  In the field of information sharing and cooperation among the Member States, the Commission decided to  prepare a cooperation blueprint to handle large-scale cyber incidents on the EU level, facilitate the  creation of an “information hub” to support the exchange of information between EU bodies and Member  States as well as work in the close cooperation with Member States, ENISA, EEAS and other relevant EU  bodies to establish a cybersecurity training platform.  Training and exercises are identified as one of the best tools to increase the cooperation between Member  States, because they are the opportunity to practice and test the procedures and – if they are not efficient  – to reformulate them.  In September 2017, the European Commission issued the Recommendation on Coordinated Response to  Large Scale Cybersecurity Incidents and Crises (European Commission, 2017c), that recommends inter alia  the following:   “Member States and EU institutions should establish an EU Cybersecurity Crisis Response Framework  integrating the objectives and modalities of cooperation presented in the Blueprint following the  guiding principles described therein” (see point (1));   “Member States should ensure that their national crisis management mechanisms adequately address  cybersecurity incident response as well as provide necessary procedures for cooperation at EU level  within the context of the EU Framework” (see point (4);   “Member States should make full use of the opportunities offered by the Cybersecurity Digital Service  Infrastructures (DSI) programme of the Connecting Europe Facility (CEF) [ (European Commission, n.d.  c)], and cooperate with the Commission to ensure that the Core Service Platform cooperation  mechanism, currently under development, provides the necessary functionalities and fulfils their  requirements for cooperation also during cybersecurity crises”;   “Member States, with the assistance of ENISA and building on previous work in this area, should  cooperate in developing and adopting a common taxonomy and template for situational reports to  describe the technical causes and impacts of cybersecurity incidents to further enhance their technical  and operational cooperation during crises” (see point (7)).  European Agenda for Security  In April 2015 the European Agenda for Security for the period 2015-2020 (European Commission, 2015c)  was adopted. The European Commission goal was to support Member States' cooperation in tackling  security threats and step up common efforts in the fight against terrorism, organised crime and  cybercrime. The Agenda sets out the concrete tools and measures which will be used in this joint work to  ensure security and tackle these three most pressing threats more effectively.  Naming fighting against cybercrime as one of the three main goals, the document also confirms how  important this issue has become for the whole of Europe. The international nature of cybercrime is very  hard to fight and that was the reason to name reinforcing tools to fight cybercrime as the one of the key  action.  European Investigation Order  Directive 2014/41/EU (European Parliament and Council of the European Union, 2014) concerns the  European Investigation Order (EIO) in criminal matters.  The EIO is “a judicial decision which has been issued or validated by a judicial authority of a Member State  (‘the issuing State’) to have one or several specific investigative measure(s) carried out in another Member  State (‘the executing State’) to obtain evidence in accordance with this Directive” (Article 1).  Improving Cooperation between CSIRTs and Law Enforcement: Legal and Organisational Aspects  Version 1.0  |  November 2017  26  The EIO replaces the traditional letters rogatory, freezing orders and the European evidence warrant. The  mentioned Directive establishes a single investigative tool valid for any type of evidence. Therefore, the  EIO may be relevant for digital evidence stored by CSIRTs of one or more other Member States that a LEA  needs to gather.  The deadline for the transposition of this Directive into national law was 22 May 2017. However, the  situation at 26 October 2017 is that the Directive 2014/41/EU is transposed into national laws in sixteen  Member States.  European Public Prosecutor's Office (EPPO)  The regulation establishing the European Public Prosecutor’s Office (EPPO) (Council of the European  Union, 2017b) was adopted on 12 October 2017 by Member States which are part of the EPPO enhanced  cooperation. So far, twenty Member States have joined such an enhanced cooperation, i.e. Austria,  Belgium, Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Estonia, Germany, Greece, Spain, Finland, France, Italy,  Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Portugal, Romania, Slovenia, and Slovakia (European Council, Council of the  European Union, 2017c). The EPPO is an independent body of the EU which will be in charge of  investigating, prosecuting and bringing to justice the perpetrators of offences against the EU’s financial  interests. The creation of the EPPO is aimed at improving transnational investigations and it is likely to play  a role in facilitating the cooperation between LEAs and CSIRTs of different countries when they have to  exchange data concerning offenses against the EU’s financial interests.  EU Data Protection Legislation  3.2.9.1 Principle of EU Data Protection legislation  The main principles inspiring data protection legislation in the EU are the following:   Article 8 (Right to respect for private and family life) of the Convention for the Protection of Human  Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, also known as the European Convention on Human Rights (Council  of Europe, 1950);   Article 7 (Respect for private and family life) of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European  Union (European Parliament, Council and Commission, 2000);   Article 8 (Protection of personal data) of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union  (European Parliament, Council and Commission, 2000);   Article 16 (on the protection of personal data) (ex Article 286 TEC) of the Treaty on the Functioning of  the European Union (TFEU) (The Member States ).  3.2.9.2 General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)  The Regulation (EU) 2016/679 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of  personal data and on the free movement of such data, also known as “General Data Protection Regulation”  (European Parliament and Council of the European Union, 2016b), repealing Directive 95/46/EC (European  Parliament and Council of the European Union, 1995), was adopted by the EU Parliament on 14 April 2016,  it is already in force and, as provided in Article 99, it will apply from 25 May 2018. This new legislation was  designed to harmonise data privacy laws across Europe, to protect and empower all EU citizen’s data  privacy and to reshape the way organisations across the region approach data privacy (European  Commision, 2017).  The GDPR is the answer to the development of modern technologies. It introduces significant changes in  the EU Data protection legislation. First of all, it increases the territorial scope of the jurisdiction (it applies  to all companies processing the personal data and data of subject residing in the Union). The GDPR also  introduces significant penalties for companies for a breach of regulations. With the GDPR privacy by design  Improving Cooperation between CSIRTs and Law Enforcement: Legal and Organisational Aspects  Version 1.0  |  November 2017  27  (for more information on privacy by design see also (ENISA, 2014), which has existed so far as a concept,  becomes now “essential elements in EU data protection rules” (European Commision, 2017).  With the definition of personal data as any information related to a natural person or “Data Subject”, that  can be used to directly or indirectly identify the person, there is also the common understanding that IP  addresses are personal data. They can be directly or indirectly related to the individuals and those  individuals could be identified.  Based on applicable legislation and the common interpretation, in principle also when dealing with IP  addresses CSIRTs process personal data: according to the decision of the European Court of Justice on  dynamic IP addresses (Court of Justice of the European Union, 2016), the IP addresses are personal data  also if the data subject cannot be identified without the intervention of the third party.  According to the Article 23 of the GDPR those rules can be restricted in case of national security, defence,  public security, the prevention, investigation, detection or prosecution of criminal offences or the  execution of criminal penalties, including the safeguarding and the prevention of threats to public security.  However, that creates uncertainty when personal data is processed in criminal investigations, defence,  public and state security. Also the Recital 49 of the GDPR sets the legal ground for the processing of  personal data by CSIRTs by affirming that: “The processing of personal data to the extent strictly necessary  and proportionate for the purposes of ensuring network and information security, […] and the security of  the related services offered by, or accessible via, those networks and systems, by public authorities, by  computer emergency response teams (CERTs), computer security incident response teams (CSIRTs), by  providers of electronic communications networks and services and by providers of security technologies  and services, constitutes a legitimate interest of the data controller concerned.”  The processing of personal data to the extent that is strictly necessary and proportionate for the purposes  of ensuring network and information security (i.e. the ability of a network or an information system to  resist, at a given level of confidence, accidental events or unlawful or malicious actions that compromise  the availability, authenticity, integrity and confidentiality of stored or transmitted personal data, and the  security of the related services offered by, or accessible via, those networks and systems, by public  authorities, by CSIRTs, by providers of electronic communications networks and services and by providers  of security technologies and services) constitutes a legitimate interest of the data controller concerned.  This could, for example, include preventing unauthorised access to electronic communications networks  and malicious code distribution and stopping “denial of service” attacks and damage to computer and  electronic communication system.  With the GDPR regulation CSIRTs should carefully plan the collection and processing of data and  information, personal data included. The CSIRT community should also avoid processing personal data  which is not consistent with the purposes, processing sensitive personal data unless strictly required and  sharing personal data that is not necessary or required to by law. Because of that, a close consultation and  cooperation between CSIRTs and Data Protection Authorities is advisable.  3.2.9.3 Directive on Privacy and Electronic Communications  The Directive 2002/58/EC concerning the processing of personal data and the protection of privacy in the  electronic communications sector (so called “Directive on Privacy and eCommunications”) (European  Parliament and Council of the European Union, 2002) as amended by Directive 2009/136/EC (European  Parliament and Council of the European Union, 2009), aims to harmonise the provisions of the Member  States required to ensure an equivalent level of protection of fundamental rights and freedoms, and in  particular the right to privacy and to confidentiality, with respect to the processing of personal data in the  Improving Cooperation between CSIRTs and Law Enforcement: Legal and Organisational Aspects  Version 1.0  |  November 2017  28  electronic communication sector and to ensure the free movement of such data and of electronic  communication equipment and services in the European Union.  GDPR (European Parliament and Council of the European Union, 2016b) clarifies that Directive 2002/58/EC  continues to apply after the adoption of the Regulation, but that once the GDPR is adopted, “Directive  2002/58/EC should be reviewed in particular in order to ensure consistency with this Regulation” (Recital  173).  There is a Proposal for a Regulation concerning the respect for private life and the protection of personal  data in electronic communications and repealing Directive 2002/58/EC (Regulation on Privacy and  eCommunications) (European Commission, 2017d). The proposed regulation seeks to increase the  protection of people’s private life and open up new opportunities for business. Two areas of the proposal  are of particular interest to this CSIRT-LE cooperation, namely:   Communications content and metadata: privacy is an issue in terms of communications content and  metadata, e.g. time and place of a call being made, as metadata is often relied upon to trace suspects  and activities leading to the conclusion that anonymization and deletion might be privacy enhancing  measures. According to the proposal processing can be carried out following consent of the parties  involved, which clearly must be given at a time prior to the investigation;   New business opportunities: once consent is granted for communications data (content and  metadata) to be processed, telecoms operators can develop a broader set of business activities and  services. In the proposed Regulation the case of heat maps indicating the presence of individuals is  mentioned. Having an exact inventory of such business models along with their functionalities and  impact for criminal investigations are likely to be of help to CSIRT and LE investigations.  This proposal follows the ordinary legislative procedure (ex-codecision procedure) (European Council,  Council of the European Union, n.d.) (European Parliament, n.d.).  The decision-making process related to  this proposal can be monitored by consulting the related Procedure File (2017/0003(COD) (European  Parliament, n.d. a) in the European Parliament Legislative Observatory database (European Parliament,  n.d. b).  3.2.9.4 LEA DP Directive  The Directive (EU) 2016/680 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal  data by competent authorities for the purposes of the prevention, investigation, detection or prosecution of  criminal offences or the execution of criminal penalties (referred as “LEA DP Directive”) (European  Parliament and Council of the European Union, 2016) repeals the Council Framework Decision  2008/977/JHA (Council of the European Union, 2008).  This Directive sets the legal basis for processing of personal data by competent authorities and law  enforcement agencies in the framework of criminal investigation. According to Article 10, processing of  personal data relating to criminal convictions and offences or related security measures should be carried  out only under the control of official authority or when the processing is authorised by Union or Member  State law providing for appropriate safeguards for the rights and freedoms of data subjects.  Directive on the Use of Passenger Name Record (PNR) Data for the Prevention, Detection,  Investigation and Prosecution of Terrorist Offences and Serious crime  The Directive (EU) 2016/681 addresses issues related to the use of Passenger Name Record (PNR) data for  the prevention, detection, investigation and prosecution of terrorist offences and serious crime (European  Parliament and Council of the European Union, 2016c). Among the serious crimes, computer-related  crime/cybercrime punishable by a custodial sentence or a detention order for a maximum period of at  least three years under the national law of a Member State is included.  Improving Cooperation between CSIRTs and Law Enforcement: Legal and Organisational Aspects  Version 1.0  |  November 2017  29  Article 18 par. 1 states that “Member States shall bring into force the laws, regulations and administrative  provisions necessary to comply with this Directive by 25 May 2018”. The Directive (EU) 2016/681 provides  that the effective use of PNR data is necessary to prevent, detect, investigate and prosecute terrorist  offences and serious crime. This implies the need to process PNR data safely. For this reason, there should  be CSIRTs specifically dedicated to ensuring the security of PNRs.  In addition, this Directive provides that the exchange of data between air carrier and LEA should only be  carried out by means of a push method, i.e. the air carriers transfer the required PNR data to the authority  requesting them, thus allowing air carriers to retain control of what data is provided. In particular, it is not  recommended the use of a “pull” method, where the competent authorities of the Member State  requiring the PNR data can access the air carrier's reservation system and extract a copy of the required  PNR data.  ENISA Regulation  ENISA, the European Union Agency for Network and Information Security, was established in 2004. The  Regulation (EU) No 526/2013 set out the current mandate and tasks for ENISA (European Parliament and  Council of the European Union, 2013). ENISA is a “centre of expertise for cyber security in Europe”  (ENISA,  n.d. c). The Agency cooperates with Members States and private sector to deliver both advice and  solutions. ENISA facilitates Pan-European Cyber Security Exercises (Cyber Europe), which main goal is to  strengthen cooperation in the field of cybersecurity on both European and state level. Standard Operation  Procedures, which were prepared during these exercises are the tool to exchange information on a  European level.  Since 2013 the challenges related to network and information security have evolved. ENISA acquired also  new tasks. According to the NIS Directive (European Parliament and Council of the European Union,  2016a), for instance, the Agency provides the Secretariat of CSIRTs Network.  The role that ENISA plays in the security of electronic communications is also highlighted by Proposal for a  Directive establishing the European Electronic Communications Code (European Parliament and Council of  the European Union, 2016d). In fact, such a proposal provides that “Competent authorities should ensure  that the integrity and availability of public communications networks are maintained. ENISA should  contribute to an enhanced level of security of electronic communications by, amongst other things,  providing expertise and advice, and promoting the exchange of best practices” (Recital 92).  In September 2017 the European Commission presented a proposal for a new mandate for ENISA  (European Commision, 2017a) (European Commission, 2017b). According to this proposal, the reformed  ENISA would have a permanent stronger mandate with related adequate resources.  This proposal, submitted to the Council of the European Union and to the European Parliament, follows  the ordinary legislative procedure (ex-codecision procedure) (European Council, Council of the European  Union, n.d.) (European Parliament, n.d.).  Europol Regulation  The legal framework for the European Union Agency for Law Enforcement Cooperation (Europol) was set in  Regulation 2016/794 (European Parliament and Council of the European Union, 2016e) adopted in May  2016, replacing and repealing previous Council Decisions concerning Europol (Decisions 2009/371/JHA,  2009/934/JHA, 2009/935/JHA, 2009/936/JHA and 2009/968/JHA). Europol assists the Member States in  fight against serious international crime and terrorism.  In 2013 Europol set up the European Cybercrime Centre (EC3). EC3’s goal is to strengthen the law  enforcement response to cybercrime in the EU. In fighting against cybercrime EC3 serves as the central hub  Improving Cooperation between CSIRTs and Law Enforcement: Legal and Organisational Aspects  Version 1.0  |  November 2017  30  for criminal information and intelligence, supports operations and investigations by Member States. It offers  operational analysis, coordination and its considerable expertise, provides a variety of strategic-analysis  products that enable informed decision-making at the tactical and strategic levels on combating and  preventing cybercrime. EC3 supports also training and capability-building in Member States and provides  technical and digital forensic support capabilities to investigate and operations.  Relevant ECJ Case Law  Case law from the Court of Justice of the European Union (ECJ) is also relevant for the CSIRTs and LEAs  cooperation. There is case law related to the concept of personal data, jurisprudence on IP addresses and  data retention.  An example is the ECJ Judgment of 6 November 2003 in Case 101/2001 - Lindqvist (Court of Justice of the  European Union, 2003) where the Court endorsed a broad approach to the concept of personal data: “The  term personal data used in Article 3(1) of Directive 95/46 covers, according to the definition in Article 2(a)  thereof, any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person” (par. 24).  Concerning IP addresses, an important ECJ Judgement is that of the 24 November 2011 in Case 70/10  Scarlet v. SABAM (Court of Justice of the European Union, 2011). According to it, “an Internet Service  Provider (ISP) could not be compelled to install a filtering system for all electronic communications, both  incoming and outgoing, passing via its services and aimed at detecting and preventing an unlawful  exchange of copyrighted works”.  In its recent judgement of 19 October 2016 related to Case 582/14 – Patrick Breyer v. Germany (Court of  Justice of the European Union, 2016), the ECJ refers to its judgement in case 70/10, by stating that “As a  preliminary point, it must be noted that, in paragraph 51 of the judgment of 24 November 2011, Scarlet  Extended (C‑70/10, EU:C:2011:771), which concerned inter alia the interpretation of the same directive,  the Court held essentially that the IP addresses of internet users were protected personal data because  they allow users to be precisely identified” (par. 33) but that such “finding by the Court related to the  situation in which the collection and identification of the IP addresses of internet users is carried out by  internet service providers (par. 34). In Judgement in case 582/14, the Court ruled that “Article 2(a) of  Directive 95/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24 October 1995 on the protection of  individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data must be  interpreted as meaning that a dynamic IP address registered by an online media services provider when a  person accesses a website that the provider makes accessible to the public constitutes personal data  within the meaning of that provision, in relation to that provider, where the latter has the legal means  which enable it to identify the data subject with additional data which the internet service provider has  about that person.”  Also ECJ case law in the field of data retention is relevant when discussing cooperation between CSIRTs and  LEAs.  The Directive 2006/24/EC (European Parliament and Council of the European Union, 2006) - no longer in  force - was related to the retention of data generated or processed in connection with the provision of  publicly available electronic communications services or of public communications networks and amended  Directive 2002/58/EC (European Parliament and Council of the European Union, 2002). The Judgment in  Joined Cases C-293/12 and C-594/12 Digital Rights Ireland and Seitlinger and Others (Court of justice of the  European Union, 2014), of 8 April 2014 of Grand Chamber, declared Directive 2006/24/EC invalid because  of the breach of the principle of proportionality. This is for various reasons, including, in particular, the  following:  Improving Cooperation between CSIRTs and Law Enforcement: Legal and Organisational Aspects  Version 1.0  |  November 2017  31   Directive 2006/24/EC did not require any relationship between the retained data and a threat to public  security. This Directive did not foresee restrictions to a particular time period and/or a particular  geographical zone. Moreover, it did not foresee restrictions to persons that could be involved, in one  way or another, in a serious crime, or to persons who could, for other reasons, contribute, by the  retention of their data, to the prevention, detection or prosecution of serious offences (see par. 59).   Directive 2006/24/EC did not provide any objective criterion aimed at determining the limits of the  access of the competent national authorities to the data and their subsequent use for the purposes of  prevention, detection or criminal prosecutions concerning offences. In general, in case of offence, a  national authority can interfere with the fundamental rights enshrined in Articles 7 and 8 of the  Charter only if the extent and seriousness of the offence are so high to justify this. Each directive  should be harmonised with the Charter (see par. 60).   Moreover, Directive 2006/24/EC did not provide any objective criterion that could guarantee that the  number of persons authorised to access and process the data retained is limited to what is strictly  necessary.   Furthermore, Directive 2006/24/EC did not provide substantive and procedural conditions about the  access to the data and the related processing by the competent national authorities (see par. 61). In  addition, the Directive was inadequate from the perspective of management of data retention period.   Finally, it should be pointed out that the Directive did not establish that the acquired data are kept  only in the territory of the European Union (see par. 68).  Also the Judgment of the Court of Justice (Grand Chamber) of 21 December 2016, in Joined Cases C-203/15  and C-698/15 (Court of Justice of the European Union, 2016), Tele2 Sverige AB v Post- och telestyrelsen and  Secretary of State for the Home Department (UK) v Tom Watson and Others, has potential interest for  CSIRTs who carry out the processing of personal data in connection with the provision of publicly available  electronic communications services in public communications networks.  The ECJ in this Judgement clarified that the measures related to the retention of data for the purpose of  combating crime also fall within the scope of Directive 2002/58/EC in the light of the general structure of  this Directive (see par. 73). In addition, it stated that every access of the competent national authorities to  retained data requires a prior review carried out either by a court or by an independent administrative  body, except in cases of validly established urgency (see par. 120).  The above mentioned ECJ case law concerns relevant issues such as IP addresses as personal data. This  jurisprudence does not specifically address cooperation between CSIRTs and LEAs however it is discussed  in this report as an example of case law that might be relevant also in the field of CSIRT-LE cooperation.  Some Article 29 Working Party Relevant Opinions  Opinions of Article 29 Data Protection Working Party might be relevant too when discussing cooperation  between CSIRTs and LEAs.  An example is Opinion 4/2007 (Article 29 Data Protection Working Party, 2007), adopted on 20 June 2007,  analysed the concept of personal data. In this regard, the opinion recalled the definition of personal data  contained in the Directive 95/46/EC (European Parliament and Council of the European Union, 1995) and  referred to the broad approach interpretation endorsed by the ECJ in Case 101/2001 - Lindqvist (Court of  Justice of the European Union, 2003) mentioned above.  The opinion proposes a balanced solution. On the one hand, it recalled that European legislator adopts a  wide notion of “personal data”. On the other hand, it stated that the scope of the data protection rules  should not be overstretched. In this opinion is stated that “unless the Internet Service Provider is in a  position to distinguish with absolute certainty that the data correspond to users that cannot be identified,  Improving Cooperation between CSIRTs and Law Enforcement: Legal and Organisational Aspects  Version 1.0  |  November 2017  32  it will have to treat all IP information as personal data, to be on the safe side” (Article 29 Data Protection  Working Party, 2007, p. 17).  National Legal and Policy Framework for the Cooperation between CSIRTs and LEAs  Also the national legal and policy frameworks govern and shape the cooperation between CSIRTs and LEAs.  Transposition of the international and European law is an important component of the national criminal  law and criminal procedure law. There might be however some specificities in legislative provisions  depending on the country.  EU Cybersecurity Policy Funding Initiatives and EU Instruments to Support Cyber Security  Collaboration at International Scale  Among the EU funding initiatives in the field of cybersecurity (for an overview see: (European Commission,  2017c)), we can mention: Horizon 2020 (H2010) programme (European Commission, n.d. b) “to pursue  cybersecurity research and innovation under the contractual public-private partnership on cybersecurity  for the period 2017-2020” (European Commission, 2017c); Connecting Europe Facility (CEF) (European  Commission, n.d. c), dedicated to the Digital Service Infrastructures (DSIs), cybersecurity being one of the  areas supported under the DSIs stream within the CEF (MeliCERTes facility for instance, which “aims to  facilitate swift and effective operational cooperation” for the CSIRTs Network (European Commission,  2017e) is an example of project conducted in the context of CEF); and the Internal Security Fund (ISF) to  “promote the implementation of the Internal Security Strategy, law enforcement cooperation and the  management of the Union's external borders” (European Commission, n.d. d).  In addition, there are some EU-instruments that play a role in support of the cyber security collaboration at  international scale, such Instrument contributing to Stability and Peace (IcSP) (European Commission, n.d.  e), European Neighbourhood Instrument (ENI) (European Union External Service, 2017) and Instrument of  Pre-accession (IPA) (European Commission, n.d. f).  Improving Cooperation between CSIRTs and Law Enforcement: Legal and Organisational Aspects  Version 1.0  |  November 2017  33  4. Challenges in the Cooperation between CSIRTs and LEAs  According to the data collected via the online survey, during the incident handling/investigation CSIRTs and  LEAs often share information. See Figure 6.  Figure 6 - Frequency of Information Sharing between CSIRT-LE During Incident Handling/Investigation, According to Data  Collected Via the Online Survey  According to the data collected, in addition to building trust, there are some challenging aspects related to  the cooperation between CSIRTs and LEAs. These can be classified into legal, organisational, and technical  challenges. Figure 7 presents all these challenges.  Figure 7 – Overview of Challenging Aspects of the CSIRTs-LEAs Cooperation According to the Data Collected via the Online  Survey  - Clustered Columns  Improving Cooperation between CSIRTs and Law Enforcement: Legal and Organisational Aspects  Version 1.0  |  November 2017  34  While overall for the CSIRTs and LEAs, the legal aspects represent the most challenging aspects of the  cooperation, if we look at the aggregated replies on aspects representing the “highest challenge” and a “high  challenge”, we can observe that the organisational aspects are considered as the biggest challenge.  According to the replies received from the online survey, the technical aspects are the smallest concern. See  Figure 8 below.  Figure 8 - Overview of Challenging Aspects of the CSIRTs-LEAs Cooperation According to the Data Collected via the Online  Survey  - Stacked Columns  Legal Challenges  Below some legal challenges highlighted during the interviews are addressed. They belong mainly to two  groups of challenges. First there are challenges related to the EU legislation under implementation. The  second are those challenges which are related to the diversity in the national legal systems.  Relevant EU Legislation Currently Under Implementation  First, the transitions’ period (periods during which an EU directive is transposed into Member States’  national law) represents a challenge: during the transition period efforts and adjustments to new legal  settings are required. Second, there are some challenges related to the implementation of specific pieces  of legislation itself.  4.1.1.1 NIS Directive  Article 9 of the NIS Directive (European Parliament and Council of the European Union, 2016a) states that  “Each Member State shall designate one or more CSIRTs which shall comply with the requirements set out  in point (1) of Annex I [requirements and tasks of CSIRTs], covering at least the sectors referred to in Annex  II [i.e. energy, transport, banking, financial market infrastructures, health, drinking water supply and  distribution, digital infrastructure] and the services referred to in Annex III [online marketplace, online  Improving Cooperation between CSIRTs and Law Enforcement: Legal and Organisational Aspects  Version 1.0  |  November 2017  35  search engine, and cloud computing service], responsible for risk and incident handling in accordance with  a well-defined process”.  One issue is that the spectrum of sectors in the NIS Directive is the minimum spectrum of sectors of  operators of essential services, in other words, the list of sectors of essential services in the NIS Directive is  not an exhaustive one. Moreover, the implementation of the NIS Directive could change the constituency  of the current national/governmental CSIRTs and this might impact the current cooperation between LEAs  and CSIRTs within the counties.  In addition, as provided in Article 2, par. 2 (a), the NIS Directive “lays down obligations for all Member  States to adopt a national strategy on the security of network and information systems”, in other words to  adopt a “framework providing strategic objectives and priorities on the security of network and  information systems at national level” (see Article 4 (3)). Most countries have already complied with this  provision; however, a few still need to adopt such strategy to comply by the set deadline to the NIS  Directive.  Finally, the NIS Directive anticipated that “Each Member State shall designate one or more national  competent authorities on the security of network and information systems” (see Article 8, par. 1) and  “have adequate resources to carry out, in an effective and efficient manner, the tasks assigned to them  and thereby to fulfil the objectives of this Directive” (see Article 8, par. 5). Similar provisions (see Article 9,  par. 2) in terms of resources are foreseen for the CSIRTs covering at least the sectors of essential services  mentioned in Annex II and services in Annex III (see above). This means that Member States need to have  adequate resources reserved to give an effective implementation to the NIS Directive and contribute to  reach the achievement of “a high common level of security of network and information systems within the  Union so as to improve the functioning of the internal market” (see Article 1).  4.1.1.2 LEA Data Protection Directive  The main challenge in the implementation of the LEA Data Protection Directive is related to the cost factor.  In order to ensure the right to the protection of personal data, the Directive provides for a number of  obligations for the data controllers. Inevitably, the fulfilment of these obligations implies costs in terms of  both staff and technical means. This could be a possible reason for resistance by data controllers to the  application of the Directive in the processing of personal data.  4.1.1.3 GDPR  The GDPR (European Parliament and Council of the European Union, 2016b) shall apply from 25 May 2018  (see Article 99 - Entry into force and application).  From the interviews conducted, the issue of IP addresses as personal data was not identified as a challenge  for the CSIRTs and LEAs cooperation. According to the data collected, IP addresses are usually considered  as personal data and treated as such. It is however important that the Member States make the right  application of the GDPR, in particular Article 23 (providing restrictions to data protections law in certain  situations and under certain circumstances) and take in due account the Recital 49 (legal ground in  processing of personal data by CSIRTs).  The retention of data and IP addresses as personal data could become an issue for the CSIRTs community  and could cause serious issues in cybercrime investigation. This is why the Member States should be very  specific in using the restriction provided in Article 23 and in applying the GDPR also in the light of Recital  49. Without that, the cooperation between CSIRTs and LEAs could become tougher. This could also impact  the CSIRTs community by making the information exchange more formalised affecting the agile culture of  CSIRTs.  Improving Cooperation between CSIRTs and Law Enforcement: Legal and Organisational Aspects  Version 1.0  |  November 2017  36  Diversity of the Legal Framework between Member States  Finally, there are the challenges related to the variety of legal systems and legal provisions in the Member  States. These challenges are particularly important. First, an event might be considered as a crime in one  country, while in another country it is not a crime. Secondly, there is a problem related to the data  retention. The diversity of conservation times between the various Member States represents a serious  problem in terms of the effectiveness of the fight against crime.  Organisational Challenges  The world of ICT is constantly evolving, because of this the challenges faced in communication between  CSIRTs and LEAs are also constantly changing. The following challenges should be recognised and  discussed.  Limitations in Skills and Availability of Specialised Personnel  A major challenge is related to the available human resources. This is because, in some cases, the CSIRTs  and LEAs have limited specialised personnel to meet actual needs. Generally, interviews have shown that,  especially in time of high workload, the number of CSIRT/LEA personnel is not enough to facilitate their  cooperation, including their communication.  Insufficient Training  Training, including publicly available online training resources, supports the development of skills within  the CSIRTs community and law enforcement community. Such training is generally targeting either the  CSIRTs - see for instance (ENISA, n.d. d) - or the LEAs, rarely both. Most of the time CSIRTs and LEAs do not  perform common training, thus they do not have the chance to form a common ground and use the same  tools, methods and terminology.  Training should concern technical but also legal and organisational aspects of the information sharing  between CSIRTs and LEAs. According to the data collected, not always do personnel receive sufficient  training on legal and organisational matters and in most cases personnel does not receive refresher  training on possible new legislative developments.  Lack of Defined and Agreed Procedures for the Information Sharing between CSIRTs and LEAs  Another important challenge is the lack of defined procedures to fulfil the obligation to share. As emerged  from the interviews, both CSIRT and LEAs sometime are lacking defined procedures, e.g. the CSIRTs to  identify whether an incident is likely to be a crime, and the LEAs to provide information to CSIRTs.  Need for a Better Knowledge of Recognised International Standards  A further challenge is the need for a better knowledge of standards relevant in the area of cooperation  between CSIRTs and LEAs. There are indeed several standards, such as some standards developed by ETSI,  ISO, and NIST, that play/could play a role in facilitating the cooperation between CSIRT and LEAs. However,  in order for CSIRTs and LEAs to take advantage from the existing standards for further enhancing their  cooperation, they need to have a better knowledge of such standards and their implementation.  Need for Building and Maintaining Trust between CSIRTs and LEAs  The mutual trust seems to be the main success factor determining the cooperation between CSIRTs and  LEAs. The vast majority of the online survey participants agreed that the most important success factor in  the cooperation between CSIRT and LEAs is trust (72%): 84% of the CSIRT community, 63% of LEA  community. In Figure 9 an overview is provided on most important success factor according to the  responses to the online survey.  Improving Cooperation between CSIRTs and Law Enforcement: Legal and Organisational Aspects  Version 1.0  |  November 2017  37  Figure 9 – Most Important Success Factor in the Cooperation between CSIRTs and LEAs According to Data from the Online  Survey  Knowing each other, understanding the culture of the other side (CSIRTs for LEAs and vice versa) and  building mutual trust by working together on many cases and various occasions, have a significant impact  on overall cooperation and collaboration within these two communities. It takes a while to build the  mutual trust and to understand restrictions and culture of the other community (LEAs for CSIRTs and vice  versa). For this reason, the personal relations are very important.  As emerged from the desk research and from the interviews, building and maintaining trust is a process  that requires investment of resources and time. Moreover, turnover of personnel, especially of those who  play the role of liaison officers, is a challenge for the cooperation between CSIRTs and LEAs because trust  building requires time and investment also in establish and maintain good personal relations.  Technical challenges  In this report technical aspects, including technical challenges, of cooperation between CSIRTs and LEAs  are addressed only very briefly. More information can be found in the ENISA report on Tools and  Methodologies to Support Cooperation between CSIRTs and Law Enforcement (ENISA, 2017).  Keeping Information Systems and Tools Up-to-Date  A first technical challenge concerns the need for a continuous software update. The need to continuously  upgrade the IT equipment involves a further challenge, related to the adequacy of the resources available  to CSIRTs and LEAs. Interviews have shown that such resources are not always available but some  economic weaknesses can be overcome thanks to the goodwill between the CSIRT and LEA personnel who,  in many cases and under the condition that it is legal, spontaneously share both software and information.  Improving Cooperation between CSIRTs and Law Enforcement: Legal and Organisational Aspects  Version 1.0  |  November 2017  38  Differences in the Modalities in Data Transmission  A second technical challenge identified concerns the need to overcome the different technical modalities  used by the various CSIRTs and LEAs for data transmission between them. This diversity is due to the fact  that CSIRTs and LEAs have different purposes. CSIRTs aim to counteract incidents, while LEAs aim to catch  the criminal.  Differences in Toolkit Used  The toolkit that is used is also very different between CSIRTs and LEAs. The former are more inclined to use  open-source tools and create custom ones. The latter usually need to have commercial, somehow verified  or acknowledged tools, so that the result of their analysis is by no means questioned in the court of law.  Improving Cooperation between CSIRTs and Law Enforcement: Legal and Organisational Aspects  Version 1.0  |  November 2017  39  5. Conclusions and Recommendations  Conclusions  Using the analysis of the results collected from the desk research, the interviews with subject-matter  experts, and the online survey, a number of trends have become clear, more specifically regarding:   CSIRTs and LEAs have different roles and objectives   CSIRTs and LEAs often share information, both formally and informally   Trust is a key factor for the information sharing   Legal frameworks and organisational challenges to the cooperation can further be worked out in a way  that cooperation between the two communities is further facilitated  Different Roles and Objectives  CSIRTs and LEAs have different but complementary roles and operate in different ways.  There is clear evidence that there are strong synergies between both communities. Findings from the  interviews have found that CSIRTs operate more on an informal basis, while LEAs are generally bound by a  more procedural approach of following rules and a hierarchical authority.  Information Sharing  CSIRTs and LEAs share often information both formally and informally. There is a lack of defined and  agreed procedure for the information sharing. CSIRTs and LEAs use a variety of methods and tools for the  representation and classification of data regarding incidents and events.  Trust  It is clear from the data collected that trust is of paramount importance for both CSIRTs and LEAs when it  comes to information sharing. Trust is seen as an enabler while a lack of trust is seen as a challenge in turn  hindering cooperation. In particular, the issue of reputational damage for a party involved in information  exchange seems to be a significant concern which has an impact on the information exchange between  both parties.  Trust is a process, not a state, which means that it is an ongoing effort that should be always sought and  strengthened. Confidence building measures, cooperation and building of mutual interests between the  two communities are key elements.  Legal Frameworks and Organisational Challenges  The data collected showed that there are challenges around the variety of legal systems and legal  provisions in the Member States. One challenge to be considered is that an incident considered as a crime  in a country, might not be a crime in another country. Furthermore, issues arise around data retention,  and in particular the diversity of data retention periods between the various Member States. This seems to  represent a serious problem in terms of the effectiveness to fight crime.  According to the data collected, there is a need for a better knowledge of standards relevant in the area of  cooperation between CSIRTs and LEAs. Indeed, in order for CSIRTs and LEAs to take advantage from the  existing standards for further enhancing cooperation, the knowledge of such standards and their  implementation by both parties should be enhanced.  In addition to the key points outline above, it is clear that training should concern technical but also legal  and organisational aspects of the information sharing. Training and skills development should cover  Improving Cooperation between CSIRTs and Law Enforcement: Legal and Organisational Aspects  Version 1.0  |  November 2017  40  changes or developments in the legal and policy framework relevant for the cooperation between CSIRTs  and LEAs, including their communication.  Recommendations  In order to further improve the cooperation, including the communication, between CSIRTs - mainly  national/governmental - and LEAs, some specific recommendations related to legal/organisational aspects  of their cooperation are proposed.  It must be noted that these recommendations have been developed based on the data and results of this  report as well as of the parallel ENISA report on Tools and Methodologies to Support Cooperation between  CSIRTs and Law Enforcement (ENISA, 2017).  The recommendations below are as much as possible focused on CSIRT-LEA cooperation; they should be  seen as additional to other more general and high level recommendations like to balance privacy and  security, or promote, where appropriate, harmonisation of criminal law among the Member States.  Place Liaison Officers on Both Ends and Facilitate Coordination Among Liaison Officers Across  Europe  It could be very useful to establish liaison officers within each organisation - LEA personnel into  national/governmental CSIRTs and CSIRT personnel into LEAs. This would be beneficial in the process of  trust building between CSIRTs and LEAs and in the process of providing reciprocal feedback. Placing  officers from national/governmental CSIRT within LEAs and vice versa (LEA officers in  national/governmental CSIRTs) would be of support for the development of a more uniformed approach to  collaboration and information sharing.  Recommendation for:   ENISA: to collect successful case studies of cooperation that has been enhanced by the presence of  liaison officers and share them with CSIRTs and LEAs communities, propose a list of main requirements  and tasks for liaison officers as well as models for liaison officers’ appointment (e.g. via secondment,  etc.)   ENISA: to propose ways for facilitating the liaison officers’ coordination across Europe   National/governmental CSIRTs and LEAs: to identify liaison officers (LEA officers in  national/governmental CSIRTs and vice versa)   Member States: to foresee the role of the liaison as a translator between both parties and allocate  resources for liaisons at national/governmental CSIRTs and LEAs   ENISA and Europol’s EC3: to propose a role description for liaison officers and models for such  placement, in order to get a more uniform approach in the different Member States   ENISA and Europol’s EC3: to collect information on the working procedures of the liaisons and review  them regularly  Formalise Intelligence Exchange  To establish a mechanism for monthly intelligence exchange between CSIRTs and LEAs, that would be also  accompanied with the relevant and agreed statistics, would be of help for fighting against cybercrime. In  addition, this will also help in trust building.  Recommendation for:   CSIRTs and LEAs: to collect data and share them as much as they can and as much as they are allowed  to   CSIRTs and LEAs: to develop a methodology on how data quality can be evaluated (and improved)  Improving Cooperation between CSIRTs and Law Enforcement: Legal and Organisational Aspects  Version 1.0  |  November 2017  41   CSIRTs: to make the Traffic Light Protocol (TLP) more well-known outside CSIRT community, especially  to the LEA community   ENISA and Europol’s EC3: to maintain and publish statistics of their respective constituencies (so other  can learn from trending)   CSIRTs and LEAs Liaisons Officers: to assist in simplifying the information exchange process and work  out relevance check procedures before sharing, and review them regularly  Simplify and Standardise the Forms for Data Requests and the Procedures to Share Information  Between CSIRTs and LEAs  To develop and to use the same forms for data requests from/to CSIRTs and LEAs and vice versa would  improve the cooperation. The forms should be developed in a way that they are in line with the common  taxonomy for CSIRTs and LEAs (Europol - European Cybercrime Centre, n.d.) - a new version of the  common taxonomy for CSIRTs and LEAs is expected to be released at beginning of 2018. Regarding  common taxonomy for CSIRTs and LEAs see (ENISA, 2015a), (ENISA, 2017). The forms should contain fields  for as a minimum all the information included in the taxonomy and should clearly indicate whether the  information received can be passed to other actors (e.g. other CSIRTs) involved in the  investigation/incident handling.  Recommendation for:   CSIRTs and LEAs: to articulate their requirements regarding how these forms and procedure should be  used   ENISA and Europol’s EC3: to collect the requirements from the CSIRTs and LEAs regarding the forms  and the procedures, to develop and propose standardised forms and standardised procedures to be  adopted by the CSIRTs and LEAs communities   ENISA and Europol’s EC3: to promote the adoption of standardised forms and procedures   CSIRTs and LEAs: to adopt and use standardised forms and standardised procedures for their  information sharing  Further Invest in CSIRT-LEA Joint Training and in Skills Development  The creation of joint training and skills development between CSIRTs and LEAs would help share existing  practices but will also allow the development of collaborative approaches in the future.  Good training plays a central role in improving the cooperation, including communication, of CSIRTs and.  ENISA and Europol’s EC3, possibly together with CEPOL, should work to extend the ENISA training material  for the law enforcement operations. In addition, joint training for CSIRTs and LEAs should be facilitated.  Those training materials should focus mainly on mutual understanding of languages used by both CSIRTs  and LEAs. There should be common understanding of legal the technical matters, including challenges  faced by one or by both communities.  There should be joint exercises based on actual cases, where CSIRTs and LEAs will practice jointly fighting  cybercrime.  If standardised forms for data exchange between CSIRTs and LEAs are developed and standardised  procedures made available, they should also be covered during the training too. The training should also  focus on (personal) data processing.  CSIRT and LEA senior management should also promote common training sessions; this can be carried out  e.g. through conferences and access to virtual library. It is important to develop the awareness that such a  joint training is necessary. Therefore, it should not be conceived as occasional, but instead continuously  Improving Cooperation between CSIRTs and Law Enforcement: Legal and Organisational Aspects  Version 1.0  |  November 2017  42  scheduled at regular intervals. In addition, it is important to ensure the quality of training through the  involvement of highly qualified individuals and the use of suitable material, including the one freely  accessible on the ENISA site.  Recommendation for:   National/governmental CSIRTs and national law enforcement training centres: to organise CSIRT-LEA  joint training   ENISA and Europol’s EC3, possibly together with CEPOL: to extend the ENISA training material to be  fitted for the law enforcement work   ENISA and Europol’s EC3, possibly together with CEPOL: to facilitate joint training for CSIRTs and LEAs   CSIRTs and LEAs: to provide the training requirements to the facilitators of the joint training   CSIRTs and LEAs: to participate in the joint training  Further Invest in Networking Events and Trust-Relationships between CSIRTs and LEAs  Events at national and EU level that bring together both CSIRTs - in particular national/governmental - and  LEAs helps not only to improve their contacts and provide reciprocal feedback, but also to provide them  with the opportunities to identify synergies and ways to further improve their cooperation. Some of such  events are already organised at national level. At EU level, an annual workshop for CSIRTs and LEAs is  organised jointly by ENISA and Europol’s EC3. This kind of events should be continued and further  promoted. Online meetings and seminars should be also considered.  Recommendation for:   Member States: to organise – or where already existing – continue to organise such events for their  CSIRTs - in particular national/governmental - and the LEAs at national level   ENISA and Europol’s EC3: to facilitate the setting-up of sessions and side-events dedicated to CSIRTs  and LEAs cooperation during CSIRTs (e.g. FIRST, TF-CSIRT) and LEAs conferences   ENISA and Europol’s EC3: to continue organising events for the CSIRTs - in particular  national/governmental and for the LEAs at EU level, to create and consolidate contacts, and to  enhance trust   CSIRTs and LEAs: to actively participate in the events with both technical teams and liaison officers and  engage in an open discussion towards a further enhanced cooperation   ENISA: to compile studies addressing aspects of cooperation between CSIRTs and LEAs and delving  deeper into specific issues of their cooperation  Effectively Implement the NIS Directive and Apply the GDPR  In 2016 the EU put into force two important pieces of legislation, the NIS Directive and the GDPR. The  effective implementation of the NIS Directive and application of GDPR will have positive effect on the  common understanding between CSIRTs and LEAs in regard to the legal aspects of their work, and on their  cooperation.  The NIS Directive aims at achieving a high common level of security of network and information systems  across the Union. Legislators should work to transpose this directive into national law as soon as possible,  in the view of the deadline of the 9 May 2018. Moreover, ENISA should provide reports on the  implementation of this directive. In order to ensure any shortcomings are addressed, these reports should  focus on both successes and challenges.  On the other hand, the GDPR is a Regulation which aims to harmonise the data privacy laws across Europe,  and to better safeguard EU citizens’ privacy. As discussed earlier in this report (see 3.2.9.2), Recital 49 of  the GDPR sets the legal ground for the processing of personal data by CSIRTs. As a regulation, it is directly  Improving Cooperation between CSIRTs and Law Enforcement: Legal and Organisational Aspects  Version 1.0  |  November 2017  43  effective in Member States; however, it leaves room in certain occasions for Member States to legislate.  For that reason, and since the GDPR will apply starting from 25 of May, 2018, Member States should work  on national laws to cover those needs, as well as to promote the compliance of all affected entities to the  GDPR. Similar to the NIS Directive, ENISA should provide reports on the application of GDPR, focusing on  successes and challenges.  Recommendation for:   EU Member States: to organise at national level events to promote the NIS Directive, and its effective  implementation within country   EU Member States: to organise at national level events to promote the GDPR, and its effective  application within country   ENISA: to analyse the implementation of the NIS Directive and the application of the GDPR focusing on  successes as well as challenges to ensure that any shortcomings are addressed  Clearly Identify Which Information CSIRTs and LEAs Are Allowed/Obliged to Share between  Them under the Current Legal Framework  To enhance the cooperation between CSIRTs and LEAs, it would be beneficial to have a clear identification  of which information CSIRTs and LEAs are allowed/obliged to share between them under the current legal  framework. This would help to point out possible legislative gaps and, accordingly, if appropriate, take  actions to fill these gaps.  Recommendation for:   Member States: to conduct studies to clearly identify which information under the current legal  framework CSIRTs and LEAs are allowed/obliged to share between them and possible legislative gaps  in their jurisdiction in relation to CSIRTs and LEAs cooperation   CSIRTs, in particular national CSIRTs, and LEAs: whenever they identify a need for new legislation or  for a change in the current legislation governing their cooperation, to express such need via their  formal and informal channels   ENISA: to collect data from the Member States and present an overview of which information CSIRTs -  in particular national/governmental CSIRT - and LEAs can/are obliged to share between them under  the current legal framework  Have in Place Legislation that Well Define Under Which Conditions CSIRTs and LEAs are  Allowed/Obliged to Share Information Between Them and their Accountability When They  Share and Reply to the Requests (CSIRT to LEA/LEA to CSIRT), as well as Reflect on Turning  Information Sharing Between (National) CSIRTs and LEAs Mandatory  To further enhance the cooperation between CSIRTs and LEAs, is also important for members of those  teams to have well-defined obligations and accountability to share information. This would also stimulate  discussion at Member State level about the nature of information sharing, and ultimately conclude if  information sharing, especially between national/governmental CSIRTs and LEAs, should be turned to  mandatory (where it is not already mandatory).  Recommendation for:   Member States: to have in place legislation that well define under which condition CSIRTs and LEAs are  allowed/obliged to share and their accountability when they share information between them and  reply to the requests (CSIRT to LEA/LEA to CSIRT), as well as to reflect on turning information sharing  between (national/governmental) CSIRTs and LEAs mandatory (where it is not mandatory already)  Improving Cooperation between CSIRTs and Law Enforcement: Legal and Organisational Aspects  Version 1.0  |  November 2017  44   Member States: to reflect on turning information sharing between (national) CSIRTs and LEAs  mandatory   European Commission and ENISA: to assist the Members States by developing model legislation to  govern and support CSIRTs and LEAs cooperation  Promote a Culture of Information Sharing Between CSIRTs and LEAs Within the Country and  Cross-Border  Apart from the legal obligations for sharing and the standardisation of the form of requests that were  described above, information exchange is also a culture that should be promoted between CSIRTs and  LEAs. Best practices as well as use cases that information exchange assisted the efficient resolution of an  incident/crime within the country of cross-border can be used as a basis for creating or further improving  an information sharing mind-set among members of law enforcement and incident response teams.  Recommendation for:   ENISA: to develop material specifically to promote the culture of information sharing between CSIRTs  and LEAs.   Member States: to use ENISA material as well as specific use cases in order to create or further  improve a sharing mind-set between LEAs and CSIRTs  Promote the Improvement of Maturity of LEAs and CSIRTs in Order to Better Facilitate the  Information Sharing  The maturity of an organisation in terms of people, processes and technology is an important factor of the  ability of the organisation to share information efficiently with other parties. For CSIRTs there are already  several maturity models which are used as an audit base for the acceptance of a team in closed groups  that focus on information sharing; an example is the ENISA online maturity assessment (ENISA, n.d. b). On  CSIRT maturity see: (ENISA, n.d. a), (ENISA, 2015c), (ENISA, 2017c), and (ENISA, 2016c)  The data collected did not provide any indication that similar models currently exist for the law  enforcement. The formulation of maturity models for LEAs would give them the chance to compare and  improve their capabilities based on commonly accepted standards, and thus reach and prove a level of  maturity that would make information exchange with CSIRTs easier.  Recommendation for:   ENISA: to promote the importance of maturity improvement and of maturity models   Europol’s EC3: to develop a maturity model for LEAs, similar to CSIRT models, that would describe  people, processes and technology parameters based on which LEAs could measure and improve their  maturity level   Europol’s EC3: to disseminate the maturity model to Member States LEAs and provide assistance on  the way that it can be used for measurement and improvement of their maturity   Member States: to promote the use of maturity models by their CSIRTs - in particular  national/governmental - and LEAs for the improvement of their capabilities, with the view of further  enhancing the cooperation between CSIRTs and LEAs  Develop Internal Security Policies Permitting and Supporting Information Sharing with  CSIRTs/LEA Counterpart  It is important that the internal security policies of CSIRTs allow as much as possible the information  sharing with the law enforcement and vice versa. So, when developing new internal security policies, both  Improving Cooperation between CSIRTs and Law Enforcement: Legal and Organisational Aspects  Version 1.0  |  November 2017  45  CSIRTs and LEAs should take this into account in order not to run the risk that information sharing  permitted by law might be hindered at the level of internal security policies.  Recommendation for:   CSIRTs and LEAs: when developing their internal security policy to shape them in a way that they do  not represent an obstacle to the information sharing with their CSIRT/LEA counterpart.  5.2.12 Make Available and Take Advantage of CSIRTs Dataset, Expertise and Contacts  CSIRTs can enrich LEAs intelligence that would be useful for LEAs investigations/prosecutions. LEAs could  have access to CSIRTs data via Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) and thus enrich their own  investigation data.  Practical examples of datasets that could be shared between CSIRTs and LEA are: annotation services for IP  addresses such as Passive DNS, Passive SSL; public information leaks; datasets about crawled information  from the darknet; and measurements based on backscatter in case of distributed denial of service attacks.  In addition, CSIRTs can provide technical expertise during LEAs investigations when needed/requested. The  CSIRTs network of contacts can be very useful during LEAs investigations.  Recommendation for:   ENISA and Europol’s EC3: to work out procedures on how the trust relationship CSIRT-constituency  can be maintained when allowing LEA access to datasets   ENISA and CSIRTs: to develop methodologies to support LEAs coordination with CSIRTs during  investigations   CSIRTs: to provide enrichment services to LEAs for their investigations   CSIRTs: to provide technical expertise during law enforcement investigation upon request   CSIRTs: to provide access to their network of contacts to LEAs for their investigations   LEAs: to make use of CSIRTs dataset, expertise and contacts and LEAs provide feedback on the quality  of the dataset, expertise and contacts.

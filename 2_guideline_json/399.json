Good practices on the implementation of regulatory technical standards  December 2018  03  Executive Summary  The Second Payment Services Directive1 (PSD2) was adopted by the European Parliament on 25 November  2015. The directive entered into force in January 2016, but Member States had two additional years to  transpose the directive into their national legislations.  The main objective of this study is to identify the differences introduced by Member States in the  implementation of the PSD2. In particular, the aim is to analyse the adaptation of the PSD2 guidelines in the  field of security, such as measures for operational and security risks, and the notification of major incidents.  In addition, an overview will be provided of how different EU Member States approach the transposition of  the directive and the preparation of Member States by requiring them to comply adequately, for example,  through the competent authorities for registration, authorisation, and supervision of payment service  providers (PSPs). PSPs have to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, authenticity, and security of sensitive  payment data and personalised security credentials of payment service users. In order to meet these  requirements, PSPs must implement the guidelines set out in the directive, regulatory technical standards,  and best practice guidelines.  For this reason, ENISA has launched a project to ascertain the real state of the PSD2 implementation in the  different Member States. The main purpose of this project is to provide an overview of the transposition of  the PSD2 and of how each country is carrying out the implementation.  Transposition of the PSD2 is, at the time of publication, on-going with 23 Member States having completed  the transposition and five Member States where the transposition is expected to be completed by the end  of 2018. Some of the main observations regarding the transposition in the different Member States are the  following:  - As regards the competent national authorities for supervision, monitoring, and reporting of major  incidents, Member States have adopted different approaches, some opting for a single entity, while  others dividing the tasks among different actors.  - As regards the security measures for operational and security risks, most of the Member States will apply  the guideline published by the EBA  - As regards major incidents reporting in Member States, most states directly apply the document  published by the EBA  - As regards notification thresholds, most Member States have followed the EBA notification guidelines,  though some have introduced minor modifications.  Finally, requirements regarding security measures and incident notification are part of both the PSD2 and  the NIS Directive; the report provides a mapping between the relevant requirements as a useful tool for  operators that need to comply with both.  1 https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:32015L2366  https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:32015L2366  Good practices on the implementation of regulatory technical standards  December 2018  04  Glossary  MS  Member State  CA  Competent Authority  EBA  European Banking Authority  ECB  European Central Bank  ENISA  European Union Agency for Network and Information Security  PSP  Payment Service Provider  ASPSP  Account Servicing Payment Service Provider  PIS  Payment Initiation Service  PISP  Payment Initiation Service Provider  AIS  Account Information Service  AISP  Account Information Service Provider  PSU  Payment Service User  SCA  Strong Customer Authentication  DL  Dynamically Link  EEA  European Economic Area  Good practices on the implementation of regulatory technical standards  December 2018  05  Content  Executive Summary 3  Glossary 4  1.

Introduction  Context and objectives of the study  The main goal of the Second Payment Services Directive (PSD2)2 is to promote competition and innovation  in financial services and to protect the security of payment service users (PSU). It will affect everything, from  the way payments are made online, to what information is sent when making a payment. PSD2 focuses on  the use of technology in financial services, introducing new technological requirements and measures to  guarantee the confidentiality, integrity, availability, and authenticity of user information.  The goal of this study is to:   Analyse how Articles 95, 96, and 98 of the PSD2 are transposed nationally in all 28 Member States of the  European Union (EU);   Analyse common aspects and differences among the different EU Member States with regard to the  transposition of the aforementioned articles of the PSD2; and   Identify good practices in the implementation of PSD2, taking into account the needs of national  authorities, the needs of industry, the European Central Bank, and the European Banking Authority.  Target Audience  The target audience for this report is the European Banking Authority (EBA), the European Central Bank  (ECB) and the national competent authorities in EU Member States.  The PSD2 was adopted by the European Parliament on 25 November 2015. This directive is an extension of  the First Payment Services Directive (PSD1, Directive 2007/64/EU) published in 2007. The deadline for the  Member States to transpose the directive into their national legislation was January 13, 2018.  The directive introduces fundamental changes in the payment service industry, such as third party access to  bank infrastructures, transparency of user information, security of personalised security credentials,  traceability of payment transactions, monitoring of security incidents, major incident reporting, etc.  The PSD2 reinforces the security of technological uses to ensure the confidentiality, integrity and availability  of sensitive payment data, for which it is necessary to implement a framework for operational risk  management and security with the following security measures:   Awareness of the payment service users   Consent of consumers   Strong customer authentication   Authentication code with dynamic link   Dedicated interface   Monitoring of security measures  The PSD2 requires that all payment service providers notify security incidents in order to promote good risk  management practices and ensure that information is shared between the public and private sectors:   Operators’ essential services in the financial sectors   Public entities of incident response centres   Public administrations  2 https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:32015L2366  Good practices on the implementation of regulatory technical standards  December 2018  8  Methodology  This study was carried out using a five-step methodology that begins with the definition of the scope. Then  it moves on to the initial stage of identification of the essential aspects of the Payment Services Directive.  The third and fourth steps include the verification of the transposition of the PSD2 into the national  legislation of the Member States and an evaluation of the transposition. Finally, the study ends with  conclusions.   Scope definition: The first step was to establish the structure, objectives, and focus of the project.   Identification of topics: Identification and in-depth analysis of the most important topics of the directive.   Verification of the status of the transposition: Analysis of the status of the transposition in the different  Member States of the EU.   Analysis of the national transposition: Comparison of the requirements of the national transposition of  Member States with respect to the original directive.   Conclusions: As a result of the activities described here, the information obtained was organised and  developed into this document, using the information gathered during the desktop research and  following the structure found in the index of this document. The final step was to check the content,  making sure that the information was reliable and accurate.  Structure of the document  This document is structured as follows:   Chapter 1. Introduction: Brief presentation of the report, listing the objectives defined and describing  the methodology followed.   Chapter 2. Dimension of the report: List of the different actors and services involved in the transposition  of the PSD2 into the 28 Member States of the European Union.   Chapter 3. Overview of the implementation of the PSD2: General analysis of the state of the strategy  into the 28 Member States of the European Union.   Chapter 4. Current state of PSD2 transposition in EU Member States: General analysis of the state of the  strategy in the 28 Member States of the European Union.   Chapter 5.

Source of data and information  The sources of the data and the information gathered to develop the study are as follows:   Publications and comments made by EBA   Other reports published by ENISA  Scope definition Identification of  topics  Verification of the  status of the  transposition  Evaluation of the  national  transposition Conclusions  Good practices on the implementation of regulatory technical standards  December 2018  9   Publications and comments from the competent authorities of the EU Member States   Directives, regulatory technical standards, and guidelines of the PSD2  Scope of the report  The Member States involved in the study are the 28 Member States of the European Union. At the time of  publication, most of the Member States have completed the transposition of the PSD2, not full transposition  is in the Netherlands, Portugal and Romania.  Types of actors  In each Member State, there will be one or several competent authorities, who will oversee and guarantee  the operation of the directive between financial entities of the Member States and the cross-border  cooperation with the EBA and ECB:   Competent authorities grant authorisations to exercise the financial tasks, control and decide on the  possibility of revoking the authorisations granted.  Good practices on the implementation of regulatory technical standards  December 2018  10   Competent supervisory authorities monitor compliance with the directive by payment institutions,  empowering them to exercise fundamental rights.   Competent notification authorities receive periodic notifications from payment service providers about  updated assessments of operational and security risks, statistical data of payment transactions made,  and serious incidents identified.   Competent sanctioning authorities impose sanctions in case of infringement of the provisions of national  law resulting from the transposition.  The following European competent authorities are also included, to whom national authorities should  provide information on payment services:   The European Banking Authority (EBA) guarantees fair competition in that market, avoiding unjustifiable  discrimination against any existing player in the market.   The European Central Bank (ECB) is responsible for overseeing the banking system and regulating the  money stock in an economy.   The European Union Agency for Network and Information Security (ENISA) is the centre of expertise for  cybersecurity in Europe.

Overview of the implementation of the PSD2  Current Status by Member States  This section presents the information obtained on how the different EU Member States approach the  implementation of the PSD2 and the contact information of the competent national authorities.  The scope of this study includes the analysis of cybersecurity topics in the payment service environments  issued by the following entities:   The European Parliament and the Council of the European Union, the PSD2 and the regulatory technical  standards of Article 98.1 (PSD2);   Second Payment Services Directive (Directive (EU) 2015/23663);   Article 98.1 (PSD2): Regulatory Technical Standards (RTS) for strong customer authentication (SCA)  and common and secure open standards of communication (Regulation (EU) 2018/3894);   The European Banking Authority, the good practice guidelines of Articles 95.3 and 96.3 of the PSD2;   Article 95.3 (PSD2): Security measures for operational and security risks of payment services  (EBA/GL/2017/175)   Article 96.3 (PSD2): Major incident reporting (EBA/GL/2017/106)  The RTS of Article 98.1 of the PSD2 is a commission delegated regulation of the European Parliament and  the Council, so there is no need for transposition and it is directly enforceable.  On the other hand, the guidelines published by the EBA require confirmation of compliance by the Member  States. If the countries comply with the EBA guidelines, they can apply the guidelines published by the EBA  directly or adapting them to the national law.  Compliance with the directive requires the supervision of the Competent Authorities. In the area of  cybersecurity, most of the EU Member States (MS) have a Computer Security Incident Response Team  (CSIRT). At the European level, there is the European Union Agency for Network and Information Security  (ENISA), operational since 1 September 2005. ENISA is a centre of expertise for cybersecurity in Europe,  contributing to a high level of network and information security in the EU, developing and promoting a  culture of cybersecurity in society to help the proper functioning of the internal market. Finally, at the  national level, there are competent national authorities for supervision, monitoring, and reporting of major  incidents.  3

Good practices on the transposition of PSD2  This chapter presents an analysis of the state of the implementation of the PSD2 in the 28 Member States  of the EU. The information presented here is accurate as of the date the study was finalised, i.e. September  2018.  Overview  The PSD2 is applicable since 13 January, 2018. Currently, almost all Member States have completed the  transposition of the new directive, with only one country, expected to finalise the transposition in the  beginning of 2019.  The Member States implement the PSD2 based on the national transposition procedures of the directives.  Each state can apply a different implementation type, such as:   Adapting the PSD2 to a new law and subrogating the current laws applied to payment services and  electronic money.   Updating the law of PSD1 with the new requirements of the PSD2.   Modifying the current laws related to the requirements of the PSD2 in the appropriate domain.  3.1.1 Competent Authorities  The PSD2 requires Member States to establish competent authorities for the registration, authorisation, and  supervision of payment service providers. Most MS have established the national central bank as the only  competent authority, while other MS, in addition to the national central bank, also have financial authorities  as their supervisory authorities. Examples include Croatia (National Bank for credit institutions and Financial  Services Supervisory Agency for investment firms), Germany (Federal Financial Supervisory Authority and  Bundesbank), and the United Kingdom (Prudential Regulation Authority and Financial Conduct Authority).  The authorities represented are valid only for PSD2 regulation. It should be noted, that other competent  authorities might be involved on a national level, through other legislative means, such as  Memorandum of Understanding, specific national legislation, and others.

Graph 2. Guideline on the security measures adaptation status  Currently, only 50% of the countries have responded to how they will adapt the guideline on security  measures, the rest are pending response. It is estimated that all countries will have made the adaptation  before the end of the year 2018, with the exception of Denmark, Germany and Slovakia, which notified that  the adaptation will take place in 2019.  The PSD2 requires PSPs to provide competent authorities with an updated and complete assessment of  operational and security risks associated with payment services. All States have established an annual  periodicity, but there are some that specify the delivery date, such as:   Estonia requires PSPs to submit the evaluation once a year but no later than 1 March.   Latvia and Poland require PSPs to submit the evaluation before 31 January.   Sweden requires PSPs to submit the evaluation before 21 February.  3.2.1 Mapping of the PSD 2 security measures to the NIS Directive  The PSD 2 has guidelines on security and operational risks with measures proposed. The NIS directive defines  minimum security measures grouped in security domains.  As PSD 2 covers payment service providers and the NIS Directive covers credit institutions, it will be useful  to have a basic mapping of the security measures and controls to help both the regulators and the  institutions.  50%  0%  50%  50%  In the process of implementation Adapted to the national law Fully complies with the EBA guideline  Good practices on the implementation of regulatory technical standards  December 2018  18  NIS DIRECTIVE PSD2  Security Domains Security sub-domains Security Measures Guideline Section  1.

Graph 4. Member States with parallel communication  Each competent authority establishes a communication channel for the notification of incidents, which can  be a web portal, email, telephone call, etc. Most authorities prefer the web portal channel, since it allows  for greater traceability and management of incidents.  Graph 5. Incident Reporting Channel  The notifications through web portals require that PSPs be previously registered, so that the authorities can  authenticate the providers that have sent the notifications and subsequently carry out a follow-up. The  competent authorities that use web portals have published a user manual on the necessary procedures for  the notifications of incidents.  3.3.2 Notification threshold  The competent authorities require PSPs to use the EBA templates to inform them of the incident. The  template will be progressively completed in three phases: initial, intermediate and final.   Phase I. Initial report   PSPs should send the initial report to the competent authority within 4 hours from the moment the  major operational or security incident was first detected.  89%  11%  One authority  Several authorities  31%  11%  58% Web portal Channel  Email Channel  In process of implementation  Good practices on the implementation of regulatory technical standards  December 2018  21   PSPs should also submit an initial report to the competent authority when a previously non-major  incident becomes a major incident.   PSPs should include headline-level information of the incident.   PSPs should also include in their initial report the date for the next update, which should be as soon  as possible and under no circumstances go beyond 3 business days.   Phase II. Intermediate report   PSPs should submit intermediate reports every time they consider that there is a relevant status  update or by the date for the next update indicated in the previous report.   PSPs should submit to the competent authority a first intermediate report with a more detailed  description of the incident and its consequences.   PSPs should indicate in each report the date for the next update, which should be as soon as possible  and under no circumstances go beyond 3 business days.   PSPs should send the last intermediate report when regular activities have been recovered and  business is back to normal, informing the competent authority of this circumstance.   Phase III. Final report   PSPs should send a final report when the root cause analysis has taken place and there are actual  figures available to replace any estimates.   PSPs should deliver the final report to the competent authority within a maximum of 2 weeks after  business is deemed back to normal.   PSPs should aim to include in their final reports full information.  Most states have followed the EBA notification guidelines. Some of the states have made minimal  modifications:   Czech Republic   It is not allowed to subcontract notifications of incidents   Italy7  This is valid only for European significant institutions, under the SSM Incident reporting framework. For other  institutions, a different incident reporting procedures are currently available8.   The initial notification must be made before 2 hours after the detection of the incidents.   The intermediate notification must be made before 10 working days from the previous notification.   The final notification must be made within 20 working days of the previous notification.   France and Malta   Notify 2 competent authorities, National Central Bank and Supervision Authority.  Regarding the statistical data on fraud related to the different means of payment, Member States require  PSPs to deliver them once a year, with the exception of Sweden, which will provide them once a semester,  before 21 February and before 21 August.  7 This is valid only for European Significant  Institutions, under the SSM Incident reporting framework.  8 https://www.bancaditalia.it/statistiche/raccolta-dati/segnalazioni/rilevazioni-vigilanza/index.html  https://www.bancaditalia.it/statistiche/raccolta-dati/segnalazioni/rilevazioni-vigilanza/index.html  Good practices on the implementation of regulatory technical standards  December 2018  22  3.3.3 Mapping of notification criteria of the PSD 2 and the NIS Directive  The PSD 2 and the NIS directive both have notification requirements, which in some cases might crossover  each other. PSD 2 covers payment service providers and the NIS covers credit institutions, which in some  cases might be the same institution.

Handling operational and security-related risks  1. A PSP shall establish a framework of appropriate risk mitigation measures and control mechanisms to manage the operational  and security risks associated with the payment services provided. As part of this framework, the PSP has to establish and apply  effective incident handling procedures. This must include, in particular, the detection and classification of serious operational and  security incidents.  2. The PSP shall provide the Financial Market Authority (FMA) annually with an updated and comprehensive assessment of the  operational and security risks related to the payment services provided. In particular, the assessment shall indicate whether risk  mitigation measures and control mechanisms taken to control risks are appropriate. The FMA may stipulate that the update of  the valuation must be made at shorter intervals.  FMA comments9: The Financial Market Authority shall take into account European convergence in respect of supervisory tools  and supervisory procedures in the enforcement of the provisions under national and European law. In this regard, the Guidelines  and Recommendations and other measures passed by resolution that are issued by the European Banking Authority (EBA) must  be applied. In addition, the warnings and recommendations passed by the European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB) must also be  complied with.  These Guidelines derive from the mandate given to the EBA in Article 95(3) of Directive (EU) 2015/23662 (PSD2). These Guidelines  specify requirements for the establishment; implementation and monitoring of the security measures that PSPs must take, in  accordance with Article 95(1) of Directive (EU) 2015/2366, to manage the operational and security risks relating to the payment  services they provide.  Austria will comply with the guideline on the security measures for operational and security risks of payment services issued by  the EBA.  4.1.2 Guidelines on Major Incident Reporting  GUIDELINES ON MAJOR INCIDENT REPORTING (ARTICLE 96.3 OF PSD2)  ZaDig §86.

If the incident affects or could affect the financial interests of its PSUs, the PSP shall immediately notify its PSUs of the  incident. The notification must clarify any action that PSUs can take to limit the negative impact of the incident.  (2) The FMA shall, upon receipt of a notification pursuant to paragraph 1, immediately inform EBA and the ECB of the relevant  details of the incident. In cooperation with these authorities, the FMA has to examine the relevance of the incident to other  relevant Union authorities and to inform them accordingly. After the FMA has examined the relevance of the incident to the  relevant authorities, it also informs them accordingly. If necessary, the FMA must take all necessary precautions for the immediate  safety of the financial system.  (3) PSPs have provided the FMA with statistical data on frauds related to different means of payment once a year. The FMA must  make these data available to the EBA and the ECB in an aggregated form.  Additional notes  PSPs shall inform the FMA in writing in the event of a serious security incident.  Measures to mitigate security incidents delivered to users shall be clear.

In this regard, the Guidelines  and Recommendations and other measures passed by resolution that are issued by the European Banking Authority (EBA) must  be applied. In addition, the warnings and recommendations passed by the European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB) must also be  complied with.  These Guidelines derive from the mandate given to the EBA in Article 96(3) of Directive (EU) 2015/2366 of the European  Parliament and of the Council of 25 November 2015 on payment services in the internal market, amending Directives 2002/65/EC,  2009/110/EC and 2013/36/EU and Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010, and repealing Directive 2007/64/EC (PSD2).  In particular, these Guidelines specify the criteria for the classification of major operational or security incidents by PSPs as well  as the format and procedures they should follow to communicate, as laid down in Article 96(1) of the above-mentioned directive,  such incidents to the CA in the home MS.  In addition, these Guidelines deal with the way these CAs should assess the relevance of the incident and the details of the  incident reports that, according to Article 96(2) of the said directive, they shall share with other domestic authorities.  Moreover, these Guidelines also deal with the sharing with the EBA and the ECB of the relevant details of the incidents reported,  for the purposes of promoting a common and consistent approach.  4.1.3 Regulatory Technical Standards on authentication and communication  AUSTRIA  ZaDig §4.

The FIN-FSA recommends that payment service providers comply with the EBA’s Guidelines on the Security Measures for  Operational and Security Risks of Payment Services under PSD2 (EBA/GL/2017/17). PSPs shall also submit annually to the FIN-FSA  a free-form assessment of the operational and security risks of payment services. The first assessment shall be submitted for 2018  by 28 February 2019.  Incidents relating to operational and security risks of payment services shall be reported in accordance the  EBA Guidelines (EBA/GL/2017/10), adhering to major incident classifications and reporting deadlines.

Finland has not made changes with respect to the requirements of the EBA guidelines.  4.9.3 Finland: Regulatory Technical Standards on authentication and communication  FINLAND  (HE 132/2017 vp) Section 85b Identification  The new paragraph to be added to Chapter 10 (some provisions and entry into force) would provide for the obligation of the PSP  to use SCA in accordance with Articles 97 and 98 of the Directive. SCA is defined in Section 8, paragraph 24 of the Act.  Paragraph 4 stipulates that the SCA referred to in subsections 1 and 2 and the security measures referred to in subsection 3 shall  meet the more stringent requirements set out in the Commission's RTS referred to in Article 98 of the Payment Services Directive.  Pursuant to Article 98 (1) (a) and (c) of the Directive, the EBA shall draw up draft standards for those standards, which shall be  submitted for approval by the Commission in accordance with Article 4. (B), secures and maintains fair competition between all  PSPs (1), (2) and point (c)), ensure technological neutrality and business neutrality (point (d)) and enable the development of  user-friendly and innovative payment methods that are readily available (point (e)). In order to revise the standards in the  development of technology and business models, Article 5 provides that the EBA will regularly review them and update them as  necessary.  According to Article 98 (1) (b) of the Directive, the Commission's RTS also specify the exceptions to the application of Article 97  (1) to (3) of the Directive, namely exceptions to the obligation of SCA and the protection of the confidentiality and integrity of  personal identification numbers. This is proposed to be provided for in paragraph 5 of the law, which stipulates that the  obligations under section 1-3 may be waived if the Commission's RTS so provide. According to Article 98 (3) of the Directive,  exceptions must be based on the level of risk (a) of the service provided, the number of transactions, the frequency or both (point  (b)) and the payment channel used for the execution of the payment transaction (c). The intention is that the unreasonably heavy  identification requirements would prevent, for example, the development of near pay. The exceptions referred to here also apply  to what has been said above for the general preparation and purpose, acceptance and review of standards.  (HE 132/2017 vp) Section 85c Communication Standards  This paragraph would provide for the obligation of the PSP to comply with common and secure open standards for communication  with other PSPs, payers and payees in their contacts on the identification, authentication, disclosure, disclosure and security  measures, the requirements of which are laid down in the Commission's RTS issued under Article 98 (1) (d). The preparation and  the purpose of the standards, the adoption and the review are concerned with the provisions of Article 85 (2), (4) and (5) of the  Directive. Article 65 (2) (c), Article 66 (3) (d) and (4) (a) and Article 67 (2) (c) and (3) (a) of the Directive refer to Article 95 (1) (d).

As part of that framework, the PSP must establish and  maintain effective incident management procedures, including for the detection and classification of major operational and  security incidents.  (2) Each PSP must provide to the FCA an updated and comprehensive assessment of the operational and security risks relating to  the payment services it provides and on the adequacy of the mitigation measures and control mechanisms implemented in  response to those risks.  (3) Such assessment must—  (a) be provided on an annual basis, or at such shorter intervals as the FCA may direct; and  (b) be provided in such form and manner, and contain such information, as the FCA may direct.  Additional Notes  The United Kingdom requires PSPs to have a framework with adequate mitigating measures and  control mechanisms to manage operational and security risks related to payment services,  including effective incident detection and classification procedures.  The United Kingdom requires PSPs to provide the FCA with an updated and comprehensive  assessment of the operational and security risks associated with payment services on an annual  or shorter interval basis.  FCA Comments2: On 12 December 2017 the European Banking Authority published final  Guidelines (link is external) on security measures for operational and security risks of payments  services under the revised Payment Services Directive ('the Guidelines').  All payment service providers (PSPs) will be expected to comply with the Guidelines from 13  January 2018 in addition to the requirements set out in Regulation 98 (Management of  operational and security risks) of the Payment Services Regulations 2017. This includes firms  undertaking account information and payment initiation services.  The Financial Conduct Authority will comply with these Guidelines. We will consult on our  approach to applying these Guidelines and our expectations on PSPs’ future reporting  requirements in 2018. Businesses wishing to apply for authorisation or registration (and PSPs  re-applying) should bear in mind that applications must contain a statement of the applicant’s  security policy, including a description of the applicant’s measures to comply with Regulation  98(1), taking into account the Guidelines.  The United Kingdom will comply with the guideline on the security measures for operational and  security risks of payment services issued by the EBA.  4.28.2 United Kingdom: Guidelines on Major Incident Reporting  GUIDELINES ON MAJOR INCIDENT REPORTING (ARTICLE 96.3 OF PSD2)  Incident reporting  99.—(1) If a PSP becomes aware of a major operational or security incident, the PSP must, without undue delay, notify the FCA.  (2) A notification under paragraph (1) must be in such form and manner, and contain such information, as the FCA may direct.  (3) If the incident has or may have an impact on the financial interests of its PSUs, the PSP must, without undue delay, inform its  PSUs of the incident and of all measures that they can take to mitigate the adverse effects of the incident.  (4) Upon receipt of the notification referred to in paragraph (1), the FCA must—  (a) without undue delay, provide the relevant details of the incident to the EBA and to the ECB;  (b) notify any other relevant authorities in the UK; and  (c) co-operate with the EBA and the ECB in assessing the relevance of the incident to authorities outside of the UK.  (5) If the FCA receives notification of an incident from the EBA or the ECB it must take any appropriate measures to protect the  immediate safety of the financial system.  Reporting requirements  109.—(4) Each authorised payment institution, small payment institution and registered account information service provider,  and each credit institution and electronic money institution which is authorised in the United Kingdom and provides payment  services, must provide to the FCA statistical data on fraud relating to different means of payment.  (5) Such data must be provided at least once per year, and must be provided in such form as the FCA may direct.  Good practices on the implementation of regulatory technical standards  December 2018  71  (6) The FCA must provide such data in an aggregated form to the EBA and the ECB.  Additional Notes  The United Kingdom has not made changes with respect to the requirements of the PSD2.

Good practices on the implementation of regulatory technical standards  December 2018  03  Executive Summary  The Second Payment Services Directive1 (PSD2) was adopted by the European Parliament on 25 November  2015. The directive entered into force in January 2016, but Member States had two additional years to  transpose the directive into their national legislations.  The main objective of this study is to identify the differences introduced by Member States in the  implementation of the PSD2. In particular, the aim is to analyse the adaptation of the PSD2 guidelines in the  field of security, such as measures for operational and security risks, and the notification of major incidents.  In addition, an overview will be provided of how different EU Member States approach the transposition of  the directive and the preparation of Member States by requiring them to comply adequately, for example,  through the competent authorities for registration, authorisation, and supervision of payment service  providers (PSPs). PSPs have to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, authenticity, and security of sensitive  payment data and personalised security credentials of payment service users. In order to meet these  requirements, PSPs must implement the guidelines set out in the directive, regulatory technical standards,  and best practice guidelines.  For this reason, ENISA has launched a project to ascertain the real state of the PSD2 implementation in the  different Member States. The main purpose of this project is to provide an overview of the transposition of  the PSD2 and of how each country is carrying out the implementation.  Transposition of the PSD2 is, at the time of publication, on-going with 23 Member States having completed  the transposition and five Member States where the transposition is expected to be completed by the end  of 2018. Some of the main observations regarding the transposition in the different Member States are the  following:  - As regards the competent national authorities for supervision, monitoring, and reporting of major  incidents, Member States have adopted different approaches, some opting for a single entity, while  others dividing the tasks among different actors.  - As regards the security measures for operational and security risks, most of the Member States will apply  the guideline published by the EBA  - As regards major incidents reporting in Member States, most states directly apply the document  published by the EBA  - As regards notification thresholds, most Member States have followed the EBA notification guidelines,  though some have introduced minor modifications.  Finally, requirements regarding security measures and incident notification are part of both the PSD2 and  the NIS Directive; the report provides a mapping between the relevant requirements as a useful tool for  operators that need to comply with both.  1 https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:32015L2366  https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:32015L2366  Good practices on the implementation of regulatory technical standards  December 2018  04  Glossary  MS  Member State  CA  Competent Authority  EBA  European Banking Authority  ECB  European Central Bank  ENISA  European Union Agency for Network and Information Security  PSP  Payment Service Provider  ASPSP  Account Servicing Payment Service Provider  PIS  Payment Initiation Service  PISP  Payment Initiation Service Provider  AIS  Account Information Service  AISP  Account Information Service Provider  PSU  Payment Service User  SCA  Strong Customer Authentication  DL  Dynamically Link  EEA  European Economic Area  Good practices on the implementation of regulatory technical standards  December 2018  05  Content  Executive Summary 3  Glossary 4  1.

Introduction  Context and objectives of the study  The main goal of the Second Payment Services Directive (PSD2)2 is to promote competition and innovation  in financial services and to protect the security of payment service users (PSU). It will affect everything, from  the way payments are made online, to what information is sent when making a payment. PSD2 focuses on  the use of technology in financial services, introducing new technological requirements and measures to  guarantee the confidentiality, integrity, availability, and authenticity of user information.  The goal of this study is to:   Analyse how Articles 95, 96, and 98 of the PSD2 are transposed nationally in all 28 Member States of the  European Union (EU);   Analyse common aspects and differences among the different EU Member States with regard to the  transposition of the aforementioned articles of the PSD2; and   Identify good practices in the implementation of PSD2, taking into account the needs of national  authorities, the needs of industry, the European Central Bank, and the European Banking Authority.  Target Audience  The target audience for this report is the European Banking Authority (EBA), the European Central Bank  (ECB) and the national competent authorities in EU Member States.  The PSD2 was adopted by the European Parliament on 25 November 2015. This directive is an extension of  the First Payment Services Directive (PSD1, Directive 2007/64/EU) published in 2007. The deadline for the  Member States to transpose the directive into their national legislation was January 13, 2018.  The directive introduces fundamental changes in the payment service industry, such as third party access to  bank infrastructures, transparency of user information, security of personalised security credentials,  traceability of payment transactions, monitoring of security incidents, major incident reporting, etc.  The PSD2 reinforces the security of technological uses to ensure the confidentiality, integrity and availability  of sensitive payment data, for which it is necessary to implement a framework for operational risk  management and security with the following security measures:   Awareness of the payment service users   Consent of consumers   Strong customer authentication   Authentication code with dynamic link   Dedicated interface   Monitoring of security measures  The PSD2 requires that all payment service providers notify security incidents in order to promote good risk  management practices and ensure that information is shared between the public and private sectors:   Operators’ essential services in the financial sectors   Public entities of incident response centres   Public administrations  2 https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:32015L2366  Good practices on the implementation of regulatory technical standards  December 2018  8  Methodology  This study was carried out using a five-step methodology that begins with the definition of the scope. Then  it moves on to the initial stage of identification of the essential aspects of the Payment Services Directive.  The third and fourth steps include the verification of the transposition of the PSD2 into the national  legislation of the Member States and an evaluation of the transposition. Finally, the study ends with  conclusions.   Scope definition: The first step was to establish the structure, objectives, and focus of the project.   Identification of topics: Identification and in-depth analysis of the most important topics of the directive.   Verification of the status of the transposition: Analysis of the status of the transposition in the different  Member States of the EU.   Analysis of the national transposition: Comparison of the requirements of the national transposition of  Member States with respect to the original directive.   Conclusions: As a result of the activities described here, the information obtained was organised and  developed into this document, using the information gathered during the desktop research and  following the structure found in the index of this document. The final step was to check the content,  making sure that the information was reliable and accurate.  Structure of the document  This document is structured as follows:   Chapter 1. Introduction: Brief presentation of the report, listing the objectives defined and describing  the methodology followed.   Chapter 2. Dimension of the report: List of the different actors and services involved in the transposition  of the PSD2 into the 28 Member States of the European Union.   Chapter 3. Overview of the implementation of the PSD2: General analysis of the state of the strategy  into the 28 Member States of the European Union.   Chapter 4. Current state of PSD2 transposition in EU Member States: General analysis of the state of the  strategy in the 28 Member States of the European Union.   Chapter 5. Good practices on PSD2 transposition: Most common aspects analysed in the transpositions  and graphs of the results obtained.  Source of data and information  The sources of the data and the information gathered to develop the study are as follows:   Publications and comments made by EBA   Other reports published by ENISA  Scope definition Identification of  topics  Verification of the  status of the  transposition  Evaluation of the  national  transposition Conclusions  Good practices on the implementation of regulatory technical standards  December 2018  9   Publications and comments from the competent authorities of the EU Member States   Directives, regulatory technical standards, and guidelines of the PSD2  Scope of the report  The Member States involved in the study are the 28 Member States of the European Union. At the time of  publication, most of the Member States have completed the transposition of the PSD2, not full transposition  is in the Netherlands, Portugal and Romania.  Types of actors  In each Member State, there will be one or several competent authorities, who will oversee and guarantee  the operation of the directive between financial entities of the Member States and the cross-border  cooperation with the EBA and ECB:   Competent authorities grant authorisations to exercise the financial tasks, control and decide on the  possibility of revoking the authorisations granted.  Good practices on the implementation of regulatory technical standards  December 2018  10   Competent supervisory authorities monitor compliance with the directive by payment institutions,  empowering them to exercise fundamental rights.   Competent notification authorities receive periodic notifications from payment service providers about  updated assessments of operational and security risks, statistical data of payment transactions made,  and serious incidents identified.   Competent sanctioning authorities impose sanctions in case of infringement of the provisions of national  law resulting from the transposition.  The following European competent authorities are also included, to whom national authorities should  provide information on payment services:   The European Banking Authority (EBA) guarantees fair competition in that market, avoiding unjustifiable  discrimination against any existing player in the market.   The European Central Bank (ECB) is responsible for overseeing the banking system and regulating the  money stock in an economy.   The European Union Agency for Network and Information Security (ENISA) is the centre of expertise for  cybersecurity in Europe.

Overview of the implementation of the PSD2  Current Status by Member States  This section presents the information obtained on how the different EU Member States approach the  implementation of the PSD2 and the contact information of the competent national authorities.  The scope of this study includes the analysis of cybersecurity topics in the payment service environments  issued by the following entities:   The European Parliament and the Council of the European Union, the PSD2 and the regulatory technical  standards of Article 98.1 (PSD2);   Second Payment Services Directive (Directive (EU) 2015/23663);   Article 98.1 (PSD2): Regulatory Technical Standards (RTS) for strong customer authentication (SCA)  and common and secure open standards of communication (Regulation (EU) 2018/3894);   The European Banking Authority, the good practice guidelines of Articles 95.3 and 96.3 of the PSD2;   Article 95.3 (PSD2): Security measures for operational and security risks of payment services  (EBA/GL/2017/175)   Article 96.3 (PSD2): Major incident reporting (EBA/GL/2017/106)  The RTS of Article 98.1 of the PSD2 is a commission delegated regulation of the European Parliament and  the Council, so there is no need for transposition and it is directly enforceable.  On the other hand, the guidelines published by the EBA require confirmation of compliance by the Member  States. If the countries comply with the EBA guidelines, they can apply the guidelines published by the EBA  directly or adapting them to the national law.  Compliance with the directive requires the supervision of the Competent Authorities. In the area of  cybersecurity, most of the EU Member States (MS) have a Computer Security Incident Response Team  (CSIRT). At the European level, there is the European Union Agency for Network and Information Security  (ENISA), operational since 1 September 2005. ENISA is a centre of expertise for cybersecurity in Europe,  contributing to a high level of network and information security in the EU, developing and promoting a  culture of cybersecurity in society to help the proper functioning of the internal market. Finally, at the  national level, there are competent national authorities for supervision, monitoring, and reporting of major  incidents.  3

Good practices on the transposition of PSD2  This chapter presents an analysis of the state of the implementation of the PSD2 in the 28 Member States  of the EU. The information presented here is accurate as of the date the study was finalised, i.e. September  2018.  Overview  The PSD2 is applicable since 13 January, 2018. Currently, almost all Member States have completed the  transposition of the new directive, with only one country, expected to finalise the transposition in the  beginning of 2019.  The Member States implement the PSD2 based on the national transposition procedures of the directives.  Each state can apply a different implementation type, such as:   Adapting the PSD2 to a new law and subrogating the current laws applied to payment services and  electronic money.   Updating the law of PSD1 with the new requirements of the PSD2.   Modifying the current laws related to the requirements of the PSD2 in the appropriate domain.  3.1.1 Competent Authorities  The PSD2 requires Member States to establish competent authorities for the registration, authorisation, and  supervision of payment service providers. Most MS have established the national central bank as the only  competent authority, while other MS, in addition to the national central bank, also have financial authorities  as their supervisory authorities. Examples include Croatia (National Bank for credit institutions and Financial  Services Supervisory Agency for investment firms), Germany (Federal Financial Supervisory Authority and  Bundesbank), and the United Kingdom (Prudential Regulation Authority and Financial Conduct Authority).  The authorities represented are valid only for PSD2 regulation. It should be noted, that other competent  authorities might be involved on a national level, through other legislative means, such as  Memorandum of Understanding, specific national legislation, and others.

Graph 2. Guideline on the security measures adaptation status  Currently, only 50% of the countries have responded to how they will adapt the guideline on security  measures, the rest are pending response. It is estimated that all countries will have made the adaptation  before the end of the year 2018, with the exception of Denmark, Germany and Slovakia, which notified that  the adaptation will take place in 2019.  The PSD2 requires PSPs to provide competent authorities with an updated and complete assessment of  operational and security risks associated with payment services. All States have established an annual  periodicity, but there are some that specify the delivery date, such as:   Estonia requires PSPs to submit the evaluation once a year but no later than 1 March.   Latvia and Poland require PSPs to submit the evaluation before 31 January.   Sweden requires PSPs to submit the evaluation before 21 February.  3.2.1 Mapping of the PSD 2 security measures to the NIS Directive  The PSD 2 has guidelines on security and operational risks with measures proposed. The NIS directive defines  minimum security measures grouped in security domains.  As PSD 2 covers payment service providers and the NIS Directive covers credit institutions, it will be useful  to have a basic mapping of the security measures and controls to help both the regulators and the  institutions.  50%  0%  50%  50%  In the process of implementation Adapted to the national law Fully complies with the EBA guideline  Good practices on the implementation of regulatory technical standards  December 2018  18  NIS DIRECTIVE PSD2  Security Domains Security sub-domains Security Measures Guideline Section  1.

Graph 4. Member States with parallel communication  Each competent authority establishes a communication channel for the notification of incidents, which can  be a web portal, email, telephone call, etc. Most authorities prefer the web portal channel, since it allows  for greater traceability and management of incidents.  Graph 5. Incident Reporting Channel  The notifications through web portals require that PSPs be previously registered, so that the authorities can  authenticate the providers that have sent the notifications and subsequently carry out a follow-up. The  competent authorities that use web portals have published a user manual on the necessary procedures for  the notifications of incidents.  3.3.2 Notification threshold  The competent authorities require PSPs to use the EBA templates to inform them of the incident. The  template will be progressively completed in three phases: initial, intermediate and final.   Phase I. Initial report   PSPs should send the initial report to the competent authority within 4 hours from the moment the  major operational or security incident was first detected.  89%  11%  One authority  Several authorities  31%  11%  58% Web portal Channel  Email Channel  In process of implementation  Good practices on the implementation of regulatory technical standards  December 2018  21   PSPs should also submit an initial report to the competent authority when a previously non-major  incident becomes a major incident.   PSPs should include headline-level information of the incident.   PSPs should also include in their initial report the date for the next update, which should be as soon  as possible and under no circumstances go beyond 3 business days.   Phase II. Intermediate report   PSPs should submit intermediate reports every time they consider that there is a relevant status  update or by the date for the next update indicated in the previous report.   PSPs should submit to the competent authority a first intermediate report with a more detailed  description of the incident and its consequences.   PSPs should indicate in each report the date for the next update, which should be as soon as possible  and under no circumstances go beyond 3 business days.   PSPs should send the last intermediate report when regular activities have been recovered and  business is back to normal, informing the competent authority of this circumstance.   Phase III. Final report   PSPs should send a final report when the root cause analysis has taken place and there are actual  figures available to replace any estimates.   PSPs should deliver the final report to the competent authority within a maximum of 2 weeks after  business is deemed back to normal.   PSPs should aim to include in their final reports full information.  Most states have followed the EBA notification guidelines. Some of the states have made minimal  modifications:   Czech Republic   It is not allowed to subcontract notifications of incidents   Italy7  This is valid only for European significant institutions, under the SSM Incident reporting framework. For other  institutions, a different incident reporting procedures are currently available8.   The initial notification must be made before 2 hours after the detection of the incidents.   The intermediate notification must be made before 10 working days from the previous notification.   The final notification must be made within 20 working days of the previous notification.   France and Malta   Notify 2 competent authorities, National Central Bank and Supervision Authority.  Regarding the statistical data on fraud related to the different means of payment, Member States require  PSPs to deliver them once a year, with the exception of Sweden, which will provide them once a semester,  before 21 February and before 21 August.  7 This is valid only for European Significant  Institutions, under the SSM Incident reporting framework.  8 https://www.bancaditalia.it/statistiche/raccolta-dati/segnalazioni/rilevazioni-vigilanza/index.html  https://www.bancaditalia.it/statistiche/raccolta-dati/segnalazioni/rilevazioni-vigilanza/index.html  Good practices on the implementation of regulatory technical standards  December 2018  22  3.3.3 Mapping of notification criteria of the PSD 2 and the NIS Directive  The PSD 2 and the NIS directive both have notification requirements, which in some cases might crossover  each other. PSD 2 covers payment service providers and the NIS covers credit institutions, which in some  cases might be the same institution.  PSD2 CRITERIA NIS DIRECTIVE CRITERIA  PSUs affected  No. of users affected by the disruption of the  essential service  Service downtime  Duration of the incident  Other PSPs or relevant infrastructures potentially  affected  Geographical spread with regard to the area  affected by the incident  Economic impact  Reputational impact  Economic impact  High Level of internal escalation  Transactions affected  Good practices on the implementation of regulatory technical standards  December 2018  23  4.

Finland has not made changes with respect to the requirements of the EBA guidelines.  4.9.3 Finland: Regulatory Technical Standards on authentication and communication  FINLAND  (HE 132/2017 vp) Section 85b Identification  The new paragraph to be added to Chapter 10 (some provisions and entry into force) would provide for the obligation of the PSP  to use SCA in accordance with Articles 97 and 98 of the Directive. SCA is defined in Section 8, paragraph 24 of the Act.  Paragraph 4 stipulates that the SCA referred to in subsections 1 and 2 and the security measures referred to in subsection 3 shall  meet the more stringent requirements set out in the Commission's RTS referred to in Article 98 of the Payment Services Directive.  Pursuant to Article 98 (1) (a) and (c) of the Directive, the EBA shall draw up draft standards for those standards, which shall be  submitted for approval by the Commission in accordance with Article 4. (B), secures and maintains fair competition between all  PSPs (1), (2) and point (c)), ensure technological neutrality and business neutrality (point (d)) and enable the development of  user-friendly and innovative payment methods that are readily available (point (e)). In order to revise the standards in the  development of technology and business models, Article 5 provides that the EBA will regularly review them and update them as  necessary.  According to Article 98 (1) (b) of the Directive, the Commission's RTS also specify the exceptions to the application of Article 97  (1) to (3) of the Directive, namely exceptions to the obligation of SCA and the protection of the confidentiality and integrity of  personal identification numbers. This is proposed to be provided for in paragraph 5 of the law, which stipulates that the  obligations under section 1-3 may be waived if the Commission's RTS so provide. According to Article 98 (3) of the Directive,  exceptions must be based on the level of risk (a) of the service provided, the number of transactions, the frequency or both (point  (b)) and the payment channel used for the execution of the payment transaction (c). The intention is that the unreasonably heavy  identification requirements would prevent, for example, the development of near pay. The exceptions referred to here also apply  to what has been said above for the general preparation and purpose, acceptance and review of standards.  (HE 132/2017 vp) Section 85c Communication Standards  This paragraph would provide for the obligation of the PSP to comply with common and secure open standards for communication  with other PSPs, payers and payees in their contacts on the identification, authentication, disclosure, disclosure and security  measures, the requirements of which are laid down in the Commission's RTS issued under Article 98 (1) (d). The preparation and  the purpose of the standards, the adoption and the review are concerned with the provisions of Article 85 (2), (4) and (5) of the  Directive. Article 65 (2) (c), Article 66 (3) (d) and (4) (a) and Article 67 (2) (c) and (3) (a) of the Directive refer to Article 95 (1) (d).

The business  sectors for these entities are depicted in Annex II of the NIS Directive.  One of the main objectives of the NIS Directive is to enact security measures for operators of essential  services (OES) across the European Union, in order to achieve a high common level of Security of Network  and Information Systems.  The current report provides a substantial and comprehensive mapping of the security requirements for OES,  as they have been agreed in the NISD Cooperation Group, to sector specific information security standards.  Initially, ENISA conducted desktop research on international security standards, guidelines and good  practices per sector. Finally, the security requirements for OES were mapped to international standards used  by operators covering all business sectors under scope. This report is a living document that we will augment  on a regular basis to keep it up to date with the latest developments.  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/ https://www.facebook.com/ENISAEUAGENCY https://twitter.com/enisa_eu http://www.linkedin.com/company/european-network-and-information-security-agency-enisa- https://www.youtube.com/user/ENISAvideos http://www.enisa.europa.eu/front-page/RSS  Mapping of OES Security Requirements to Specific Sectors  December 2017  05  European Union Agency for Network and Information Security  ENISA - The EU Cyber Security Agency  Follow the EU cyber security affairs of ENISA:  www.enisa.europa.eu & Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, YouTube, RSS feeds  1 Introduction  This report provides the mapping  of security measures for OES to international standards used by operators  in the business sectors mentioned in Annex II of the NIS Directive1, namely energy, transport, banking,  financial market infrastructures, health, drinking water supply & distribution and digital infrastructures.  The current report involves the security requirements for OES, as they have been defined in the specific work  stream of the Cooperation Group of the NIS Directive, and they are presented in details in ENISA’s deliverable  “Baseline Security Requirements for OES”. The mapping of security requirements for OES to specific sector  standards contributes to achieving a common and converged level of security in network and information  systems (Article 3 of the NIS Directive) at EU level. This report is a ‘living document’ that we will augment on  a regular basis to keep it up to date with the latest developments.  It is important to note that the security measures described in this document derived from the work  performed under the specific work stream of the NIS Directive Cooperation Group for the security measures  for OES. The proposed security measures are not intended to replace existing standards, frameworks or  good-practices in use by OES. However, operators could map the standards they use (internally) to the  proposed security measures, and in this way assess their information security practices against the  requirements adopted by the Cooperation Group.  1.1 Background  The NIS Directive was adopted by the European Parliament on the 6th of July, 2016 and entered into force in  August 2016. Member States have 21 months to transpose the Directive into their national legislation and 6  more months to identify operators of essential services.  The ultimate goal of the NIS Directive is to ensure a culture of network and information systems security  across sectors (i.e. energy, transport, water, banking, financial market infrastructures, healthcare and digital  infrastructure), vital for our society and economy and heavily dependent on ICT (Article 5 §2-b, NISD). The  operators identified by the Member States as OES should take appropriate and proportionate technical and  organisational measures to manage the risks posed to the security of network and information systems  which they use in their operations (Article 14 §1, NISD). Therefore, this mapping contributes to the  establishment of a harmonised baseline security level of OES across EU.  1.2 Target Audience  The intended audience of this report consists of the OES as well as the public authorities for the following  (sub)sectors:   Energy  o Electricity  o Oil  1 http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32016L1148&from=EN  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/ https://www.facebook.com/ENISAEUAGENCY https://twitter.com/enisa_eu http://www.linkedin.com/company/european-network-and-information-security-agency-enisa- https://www.youtube.com/user/ENISAvideos http://www.enisa.europa.eu/front-page/RSS http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32016L1148&from=EN  Mapping of OES Security Requirements to Specific Sectors  December 2017  06  European Union Agency for Network and Information Security  ENISA - The EU Cyber Security Agency  Follow the EU cyber security affairs of ENISA:  www.enisa.europa.eu & Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, YouTube, RSS feeds  o Gas   Transport  o Air Transport  o Rail Transport  o Water Transport  o Road Transport   Banking   Financial Market Infrastructures   Health   Drinking Water Supply & Distribution   Digital Infrastructures  1.3 Goal and Scope of the report  The main goal of this report is to associate the security requirements for OES, adopted by the Cooperation  Group, with information security standards applicable to the sectors of interest as mentioned above and  referred to in the Annex II of the NIS Directive. In order to achieve a common, baseline, cross-sector  (horizontal) framework of security measures for the OES at EU level, the security requirements for the OES  are primarily mapped to the most frequently used international information security standards by operators  in each of these sectors.  1.4 Methodology  Initially, ENISA conducted a desktop research of international information security standards, guidelines and  good practices, relevant to security measures applicable by OES of the business sectors in scope. The final  output of the desktop research is contained in the tables [Table 1,Table 2,Table 4,Table 6,Table 8,Table 9,  Table 11, Table 12, Table 14, Table 16 ,Table 17 ], depicting the existing information security standards and  good practices for each sector, as found in section 2.  The next step of the methodology was to map the identified and agreed by the Cooperation Group security  measures for OES to the most commonly applicable sector specific standards by the operators of the  business sectors.  Finally, the security measures were mapped to the three (3) most frequently used international standards,  across all the sectors of interest, as found below:   ISO 27001  ISO/IEC 270012, part of the growing ISO/IEC 27000 family of standards, is an Information Security  Management Systems (ISMS) standard published in October 2013 by the International Organization  for Standardization (ISO) and the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC). ISO/IEC 27001  formally specifies a management system that is intended to bring information security under  explicit management control.  2 https://www.iso.org/isoiec-27001-information-security.html  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/ https://www.facebook.com/ENISAEUAGENCY https://twitter.com/enisa_eu http://www.linkedin.com/company/european-network-and-information-security-agency-enisa- https://www.youtube.com/user/ENISAvideos http://www.enisa.europa.eu/front-page/RSS  Mapping of OES Security Requirements to Specific Sectors  December 2017  07  European Union Agency for Network and Information Security  ENISA - The EU Cyber Security Agency  Follow the EU cyber security affairs of ENISA:  www.enisa.europa.eu & Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, YouTube, RSS feeds   ANSI ISA/IEC 624433  ISA (International Society of Automation) and IEC have developed the IEC 624434 series of standards  in order to address the need to design cybersecurity robustness and resilience into industrial  automation control systems (IACS). The concept of industrial automation and control systems  electronic security is applied in the broadest possible sense, encompassing all types of plants,  facilities, and systems in all industries. IEC 62443 targets people, processes, systems, solutions and  components/products.   NIST Framework for Improving Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity5  This Framework6 enables organizations – regardless of size, degree of cybersecurity risk, or  cybersecurity sophistication to apply the principles and best practices of risk management to  improving the security and resilience of critical infrastructure. The Framework provides structure to  today’s multiple approaches to cybersecurity by assembling standards, guidelines, and practices  that are working effectively in industry today. Moreover, because it references globally recognized  standards for cybersecurity, the Framework can also be used by organizations located outside the  United States and can serve as a model for international cooperation on strengthening critical  infrastructure cybersecurity.  The above standards were selected according to:   the results of the survey that was filled in by the representatives of EU Member States, in the  Cooperation Group. The survey was launched on 6th March 2017 and it was active until 15th May  2017. More specifically, ISO 27001 was emerged by the survey as the most commonly followed  standard.   the input provided during phone interviews by EU operators in the sectors; referred to the NIS  Directive. More specifically,  o ANSI ISA/IEC 62443 is the most applicable international standard for IACS (Industrial  Automation and Control Systems), as they constitute the core components of the OES;  o NIST Cybersecurity Framework is followed by some European utilities which operate in U.S.  and therefore they need a common denominator and ground policy.  3 These documents were originally referred to as ANSI/ISA-99 or ISA99 standards, as they were created by the International Society  for Automation (ISA) and publicly released as American National Standards Institute (ANSI) documents. In 2010, they were  renumbered to be the ANSI/ISA-62443 series. This change was intended to align the ISA and ANSI document numbering  with the corresponding International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) standards  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyber_security_standards  4 https://www.isa.org/store/ansi/isa-62443-3-3-990303-2013-security-for-industrial-automation-and-control-systems-part-3-3- system-security-requirements-and-security-levels/116785  5 The Version 1.0 of the NIST Cybersecurity Framework was taken into account for the mapping it, as the newest  version of the framework is still in draft status.  6 https://www.nist.gov/sites/default/files/documents/cyberframework/cybersecurity-framework-021214.pdf  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/ https://www.facebook.com/ENISAEUAGENCY https://twitter.com/enisa_eu http://www.linkedin.com/company/european-network-and-information-security-agency-enisa- https://www.youtube.com/user/ENISAvideos http://www.enisa.europa.eu/front-page/RSS https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Society_of_Automation https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Society_of_Automation https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_National_Standards_Institute https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Electrotechnical_Commission https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyber_security_standards  Mapping of OES Security Requirements to Specific Sectors  December 2017  08  European Union Agency for Network and Information Security  ENISA - The EU Cyber Security Agency  Follow the EU cyber security affairs of ENISA:  www.enisa.europa.eu & Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, YouTube, RSS feeds  2 Mapping of Baseline Security Measures for OESs per sector  With the adoption of the Directive on security of Network and Information Systems (NIS) in 2016, a baseline  level of security in network and information systems is aimed to be achieved at EU level. This will support  the broader vision of the EU Digital Single Market7, whilst protecting the interests of the European society  and the provision of essential services to European citizens.  The following subsections present the mapping of the proposed security measures by the NIS Directive  Cooperation Group to industry specific standards that are usually applied by operators covering the sectors  under scope.  2.1 Energy  The European Union's prosperity and security hinges on a stable and abundant supply of energy. As energy  is a vital part of Europe's economy and of modern lifestyles, European citizens expect uninterrupted flows  of energy and access to energy sources. Numerous policies have been introduced to secure and create a  European sustainable energy network, like the NIS Directive. The NIS Directive distinguishes the subsectors  of Electricity, Oil and Gas for the Energy sector.  Table 1 below, lists international standards and good practices applicable across all the Energy subsectors  of interest. It is the outcome of the conducted desktop research and it is not an all-inclusive table, as it is  mainly based on bibliography.

Due to a great range of threats, cyber security and physical safety of the transport sector can no longer be  treated separately14. Among the good practices for the transport sector, the “Roadmap to Secure Control  Systems in the Transportation Sector” 15 is included, while there are no specific cybersecurity standards.  Therefore, risk management methodologies and security standards usually incorporate measures of both  natures, cyber and physical as well. Besides ISO 27001 and ISA/IEC 62443 standards that are mainly followed  by transport operators, in the following sections, the mapping of security measures to specific subsector  standards is presented respectively.  2.2.1 Air Transport  Table 6 lists international standards and good practices applicable across the Air Transport sector.

As this standard is not publicly available, the mapping of security measures to this  standard is not presented.  Nevertheless, ISO 27001 is the most applicable standard for both vehicle and road-side infrastructure, while  ANSI ISA/IEC 62443 is usually applied in the road side infrastructure. The mapping of the security measures  to these two standards is provided below in section 3, Table 22.  2.3 Financial and Banking  Table 12 lists international standards and good practices applicable across the Financial and Banking  sector.  24 https://www.iso.org/standard/70918.html  25 https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/#iso:std:iso:26262:-1:en  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/ https://www.facebook.com/ENISAEUAGENCY https://twitter.com/enisa_eu http://www.linkedin.com/company/european-network-and-information-security-agency-enisa- https://www.youtube.com/user/ENISAvideos http://www.enisa.europa.eu/front-page/RSS  Mapping of OES Security Requirements to Specific Sectors  December 2017  28  European Union Agency for Network and Information Security  ENISA - The EU Cyber Security Agency  Follow the EU cyber security affairs of ENISA:  www.enisa.europa.eu & Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, YouTube, RSS feeds  SECTOR STANDARDS  GOOD PRACTICES  Financial &  Banking   ISO/TR 13569:2005   Gramm–Leach–Bliley Act   Sarbanes–Oxley Act   Payment services (PSD 2) - Directive (EU)  2015/2366   EBA on the security of internet payments26   ISO/IEC 27015:2012 Information technology -  Security techniques – Information security  management guidelines for financial services   American National Standards Institute (ANSI) X9  series   Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard  (PCI DSS)   Basel II27   Draft Guidelines on the security measures for  operational and security risks of payment services  under PSD228   CPMI-IOSCO Guidance on cyber resilience for  financial market infrastructure29   SEC OCIE Cybersecurity30]  Table 12: International standards and good practices applicable across the Financial and Banking sector  According to input taken by Financial and Banking institutions in EU, Table 13, illustrates the mapping of  security measures to sector specific standards and good practices, such as:   ISO/TR 13569:2005 Financial services -- Information security guidelines31  provides guidelines on  the development of an information security programme for institutions in the financial services  industry. Considerations for the selection and implementation of security controls, and the elements  required to manage information security risk within a modern financial services institution are  discussed.   Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLB Act or GLBA) 32 , also known as the Financial Modernization Act of  1999, is a federal law enacted in the United States to control the ways that financial institutions deal  with the private information of individuals. It requires financial institutions – companies that offer  consumers financial products or services like loans, financial or investment advice, or insurance – to  explain their information-sharing practices to their customers and to safeguard sensitive data.   Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (SOX) 33 is an act passed by U.S. Congress in 2002 to protect investors  from the possibility of fraudulent accounting activities by corporations. The SOX Act mandated strict  reforms to improve financial disclosures from corporations and prevent accounting fraud.  26 http://www.eba.europa.eu/regulation-and-policy/consumer-protection-and-financial-innovation/guidelines-on-the-security-of- internet-payments  27Basel II or International Convergence of Capital Measurement and Capital Standards is a set of recommendations  issued by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision. Basel II is considered by the Basel Committee to be instrumental  in assessments of risk provided by banks’ internal systems as inputs to capital calculations. Its relevance is complicated,  since it is partially dependant on whether or not local governments have adopted it into their local regulations (or if  Basel I has), and how this adoption has occurred.

It takes into account emerging and innovative payment services, such as  internet and mobile payments. It sets out rules concerning strict security requirements for electronic  payments and the protection of consumers' financial data, guaranteeing safe authentication and  reducing the risk of fraud; the transparency of conditions and information requirements for payment  services; the rights and obligations of users and providers of payment services.   Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) 35 is an information security standard for  organizations that handle branded credit cards from the major card schemes. The PCI Standard is  mandated by the card brands and administered by the Payment Card Industry Security Standards  Council.

It  defines guidelines to support the interpretation and implementation in health informatics of ISO/IEC  27002 and is a companion to that International Standard.   Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) 39 required the Secretary of  the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to develop regulations protecting the  privacy and security of certain health information. The Security Standards for the Protection of  Electronic Protected Health Information (the Security Rule) 40 establish a national set of security  standards for protecting certain health information that is held or transferred in electronic form. The  Security Rule operationalizes the protections contained in the Privacy Rule41 by addressing the  technical and non-technical safeguards that organizations called “covered entities” must put in place  to secure individuals’ “electronic protected health information” (e-PHI).  37 http://www.etsi.org/technologies-clusters/technologies/ehealth  38 https://www.iso.org/standard/62777.html  39 https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/security/index.html?language=es  40 https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/privacy/index.html?language=es  41 https://www.awwa.org/store/productdetail.aspx?productid=20779  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/ https://www.facebook.com/ENISAEUAGENCY https://twitter.com/enisa_eu http://www.linkedin.com/company/european-network-and-information-security-agency-enisa- https://www.youtube.com/user/ENISAvideos http://www.enisa.europa.eu/front-page/RSS http://www.etsi.org/technologies-clusters/technologies/ehealth https://www.awwa.org/store/productdetail.aspx?productid=20779  Mapping of OES Security Requirements to Specific Sectors  December 2017  38  European Union Agency for Network and Information Security  ENISA -

The standards and good practices, that are usually applied by the operators of all the sectors referred to in  the NIS Directive, were identified through the survey filled in by the Cooperation Group representatives, as  well as by the feedback provided by EU operators, are:   ISO 27001 Revision 2013, which is the most globally widespread standard covering all aspects of  information security management systems across all the sectors.   ISA/IEC 62443, which is a series of standards that define procedures for implementing electronically  secure Industrial Automation and Control Systems (IACS). This guidance applies to end-users (i.e.  asset owner), system integrators, security practitioners, and control systems manufacturers  responsible for manufacturing, designing, implementing, or managing industrial automation and  control systems.   NIST Cybersecurity Framework, which despite the fact that is not compulsory even in the U.S., it is  usually followed by EU operators that work beyond EU’s territory as it is a good point of reference  for cybersecurity requirements.

The business  sectors for these entities are depicted in Annex II of the NIS Directive.  One of the main objectives of the NIS Directive is to enact security measures for operators of essential  services (OES) across the European Union, in order to achieve a high common level of Security of Network  and Information Systems.  The current report provides a substantial and comprehensive mapping of the security requirements for OES,  as they have been agreed in the NISD Cooperation Group, to sector specific information security standards.  Initially, ENISA conducted desktop research on international security standards, guidelines and good  practices per sector. Finally, the security requirements for OES were mapped to international standards used  by operators covering all business sectors under scope. This report is a living document that we will augment  on a regular basis to keep it up to date with the latest developments.  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/ https://www.facebook.com/ENISAEUAGENCY https://twitter.com/enisa_eu http://www.linkedin.com/company/european-network-and-information-security-agency-enisa- https://www.youtube.com/user/ENISAvideos http://www.enisa.europa.eu/front-page/RSS  Mapping of OES Security Requirements to Specific Sectors  December 2017  05  European Union Agency for Network and Information Security  ENISA - The EU Cyber Security Agency  Follow the EU cyber security affairs of ENISA:  www.enisa.europa.eu & Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, YouTube, RSS feeds  1 Introduction  This report provides the mapping  of security measures for OES to international standards used by operators  in the business sectors mentioned in Annex II of the NIS Directive1, namely energy, transport, banking,  financial market infrastructures, health, drinking water supply & distribution and digital infrastructures.  The current report involves the security requirements for OES, as they have been defined in the specific work  stream of the Cooperation Group of the NIS Directive, and they are presented in details in ENISA’s deliverable  “Baseline Security Requirements for OES”. The mapping of security requirements for OES to specific sector  standards contributes to achieving a common and converged level of security in network and information  systems (Article 3 of the NIS Directive) at EU level. This report is a ‘living document’ that we will augment on  a regular basis to keep it up to date with the latest developments.  It is important to note that the security measures described in this document derived from the work  performed under the specific work stream of the NIS Directive Cooperation Group for the security measures  for OES. The proposed security measures are not intended to replace existing standards, frameworks or  good-practices in use by OES. However, operators could map the standards they use (internally) to the  proposed security measures, and in this way assess their information security practices against the  requirements adopted by the Cooperation Group.  1.1 Background  The NIS Directive was adopted by the European Parliament on the 6th of July, 2016 and entered into force in  August 2016. Member States have 21 months to transpose the Directive into their national legislation and 6  more months to identify operators of essential services.  The ultimate goal of the NIS Directive is to ensure a culture of network and information systems security  across sectors (i.e. energy, transport, water, banking, financial market infrastructures, healthcare and digital  infrastructure), vital for our society and economy and heavily dependent on ICT (Article 5 §2-b, NISD). The  operators identified by the Member States as OES should take appropriate and proportionate technical and  organisational measures to manage the risks posed to the security of network and information systems  which they use in their operations (Article 14 §1, NISD). Therefore, this mapping contributes to the  establishment of a harmonised baseline security level of OES across EU.  1.2 Target Audience  The intended audience of this report consists of the OES as well as the public authorities for the following  (sub)sectors:   Energy  o Electricity  o Oil  1 http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32016L1148&from=EN  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/ https://www.facebook.com/ENISAEUAGENCY https://twitter.com/enisa_eu http://www.linkedin.com/company/european-network-and-information-security-agency-enisa- https://www.youtube.com/user/ENISAvideos http://www.enisa.europa.eu/front-page/RSS http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32016L1148&from=EN  Mapping of OES Security Requirements to Specific Sectors  December 2017  06  European Union Agency for Network and Information Security  ENISA - The EU Cyber Security Agency  Follow the EU cyber security affairs of ENISA:  www.enisa.europa.eu & Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, YouTube, RSS feeds  o Gas   Transport  o Air Transport  o Rail Transport  o Water Transport  o Road Transport   Banking   Financial Market Infrastructures   Health   Drinking Water Supply & Distribution   Digital Infrastructures  1.3 Goal and Scope of the report  The main goal of this report is to associate the security requirements for OES, adopted by the Cooperation  Group, with information security standards applicable to the sectors of interest as mentioned above and  referred to in the Annex II of the NIS Directive. In order to achieve a common, baseline, cross-sector  (horizontal) framework of security measures for the OES at EU level, the security requirements for the OES  are primarily mapped to the most frequently used international information security standards by operators  in each of these sectors.  1.4 Methodology  Initially, ENISA conducted a desktop research of international information security standards, guidelines and  good practices, relevant to security measures applicable by OES of the business sectors in scope. The final  output of the desktop research is contained in the tables [Table 1,Table 2,Table 4,Table 6,Table 8,Table 9,  Table 11, Table 12, Table 14, Table 16 ,Table 17 ], depicting the existing information security standards and  good practices for each sector, as found in section 2.  The next step of the methodology was to map the identified and agreed by the Cooperation Group security  measures for OES to the most commonly applicable sector specific standards by the operators of the  business sectors.  Finally, the security measures were mapped to the three (3) most frequently used international standards,  across all the sectors of interest, as found below:   ISO 27001  ISO/IEC 270012, part of the growing ISO/IEC 27000 family of standards, is an Information Security  Management Systems (ISMS) standard published in October 2013 by the International Organization  for Standardization (ISO) and the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC). ISO/IEC 27001  formally specifies a management system that is intended to bring information security under  explicit management control.  2 https://www.iso.org/isoiec-27001-information-security.html  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/ https://www.facebook.com/ENISAEUAGENCY https://twitter.com/enisa_eu http://www.linkedin.com/company/european-network-and-information-security-agency-enisa- https://www.youtube.com/user/ENISAvideos http://www.enisa.europa.eu/front-page/RSS  Mapping of OES Security Requirements to Specific Sectors  December 2017  07  European Union Agency for Network and Information Security  ENISA - The EU Cyber Security Agency  Follow the EU cyber security affairs of ENISA:  www.enisa.europa.eu & Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, YouTube, RSS feeds   ANSI ISA/IEC 624433  ISA (International Society of Automation) and IEC have developed the IEC 624434 series of standards  in order to address the need to design cybersecurity robustness and resilience into industrial  automation control systems (IACS). The concept of industrial automation and control systems  electronic security is applied in the broadest possible sense, encompassing all types of plants,  facilities, and systems in all industries. IEC 62443 targets people, processes, systems, solutions and  components/products.   NIST Framework for Improving Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity5  This Framework6 enables organizations – regardless of size, degree of cybersecurity risk, or  cybersecurity sophistication to apply the principles and best practices of risk management to  improving the security and resilience of critical infrastructure. The Framework provides structure to  today’s multiple approaches to cybersecurity by assembling standards, guidelines, and practices  that are working effectively in industry today. Moreover, because it references globally recognized  standards for cybersecurity, the Framework can also be used by organizations located outside the  United States and can serve as a model for international cooperation on strengthening critical  infrastructure cybersecurity.  The above standards were selected according to:   the results of the survey that was filled in by the representatives of EU Member States, in the  Cooperation Group. The survey was launched on 6th March 2017 and it was active until 15th May  2017. More specifically, ISO 27001 was emerged by the survey as the most commonly followed  standard.   the input provided during phone interviews by EU operators in the sectors; referred to the NIS  Directive. More specifically,  o ANSI ISA/IEC 62443 is the most applicable international standard for IACS (Industrial  Automation and Control Systems), as they constitute the core components of the OES;  o NIST Cybersecurity Framework is followed by some European utilities which operate in U.S.  and therefore they need a common denominator and ground policy.  3 These documents were originally referred to as ANSI/ISA-99 or ISA99 standards, as they were created by the International Society  for Automation (ISA) and publicly released as American National Standards Institute (ANSI) documents. In 2010, they were  renumbered to be the ANSI/ISA-62443 series. This change was intended to align the ISA and ANSI document numbering  with the corresponding International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) standards  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyber_security_standards  4 https://www.isa.org/store/ansi/isa-62443-3-3-990303-2013-security-for-industrial-automation-and-control-systems-part-3-3- system-security-requirements-and-security-levels/116785  5 The Version 1.0 of the NIST Cybersecurity Framework was taken into account for the mapping it, as the newest  version of the framework is still in draft status.  6 https://www.nist.gov/sites/default/files/documents/cyberframework/cybersecurity-framework-021214.pdf  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/ https://www.facebook.com/ENISAEUAGENCY https://twitter.com/enisa_eu http://www.linkedin.com/company/european-network-and-information-security-agency-enisa- https://www.youtube.com/user/ENISAvideos http://www.enisa.europa.eu/front-page/RSS https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Society_of_Automation https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Society_of_Automation https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_National_Standards_Institute https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Electrotechnical_Commission https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyber_security_standards  Mapping of OES Security Requirements to Specific Sectors  December 2017  08  European Union Agency for Network and Information Security  ENISA - The EU Cyber Security Agency  Follow the EU cyber security affairs of ENISA:  www.enisa.europa.eu & Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, YouTube, RSS feeds  2 Mapping of Baseline Security Measures for OESs per sector  With the adoption of the Directive on security of Network and Information Systems (NIS) in 2016, a baseline  level of security in network and information systems is aimed to be achieved at EU level. This will support  the broader vision of the EU Digital Single Market7, whilst protecting the interests of the European society  and the provision of essential services to European citizens.  The following subsections present the mapping of the proposed security measures by the NIS Directive  Cooperation Group to industry specific standards that are usually applied by operators covering the sectors  under scope.  2.1 Energy  The European Union's prosperity and security hinges on a stable and abundant supply of energy. As energy  is a vital part of Europe's economy and of modern lifestyles, European citizens expect uninterrupted flows  of energy and access to energy sources. Numerous policies have been introduced to secure and create a  European sustainable energy network, like the NIS Directive. The NIS Directive distinguishes the subsectors  of Electricity, Oil and Gas for the Energy sector.  Table 1 below, lists international standards and good practices applicable across all the Energy subsectors  of interest. It is the outcome of the conducted desktop research and it is not an all-inclusive table, as it is  mainly based on bibliography.

Due to a great range of threats, cyber security and physical safety of the transport sector can no longer be  treated separately14. Among the good practices for the transport sector, the “Roadmap to Secure Control  Systems in the Transportation Sector” 15 is included, while there are no specific cybersecurity standards.  Therefore, risk management methodologies and security standards usually incorporate measures of both  natures, cyber and physical as well. Besides ISO 27001 and ISA/IEC 62443 standards that are mainly followed  by transport operators, in the following sections, the mapping of security measures to specific subsector  standards is presented respectively.  2.2.1 Air Transport  Table 6 lists international standards and good practices applicable across the Air Transport sector.

As this standard is not publicly available, the mapping of security measures to this  standard is not presented.  Nevertheless, ISO 27001 is the most applicable standard for both vehicle and road-side infrastructure, while  ANSI ISA/IEC 62443 is usually applied in the road side infrastructure. The mapping of the security measures  to these two standards is provided below in section 3, Table 22.  2.3 Financial and Banking  Table 12 lists international standards and good practices applicable across the Financial and Banking  sector.  24 https://www.iso.org/standard/70918.html  25 https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/#iso:std:iso:26262:-1:en  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/ https://www.facebook.com/ENISAEUAGENCY https://twitter.com/enisa_eu http://www.linkedin.com/company/european-network-and-information-security-agency-enisa- https://www.youtube.com/user/ENISAvideos http://www.enisa.europa.eu/front-page/RSS  Mapping of OES Security Requirements to Specific Sectors  December 2017  28  European Union Agency for Network and Information Security  ENISA - The EU Cyber Security Agency  Follow the EU cyber security affairs of ENISA:  www.enisa.europa.eu & Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, YouTube, RSS feeds  SECTOR STANDARDS  GOOD PRACTICES  Financial &  Banking   ISO/TR 13569:2005   Gramm–Leach–Bliley Act   Sarbanes–Oxley Act   Payment services (PSD 2) - Directive (EU)  2015/2366   EBA on the security of internet payments26   ISO/IEC 27015:2012 Information technology -  Security techniques – Information security  management guidelines for financial services   American National Standards Institute (ANSI) X9  series   Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard  (PCI DSS)   Basel II27   Draft Guidelines on the security measures for  operational and security risks of payment services  under PSD228   CPMI-IOSCO Guidance on cyber resilience for  financial market infrastructure29   SEC OCIE Cybersecurity30]  Table 12: International standards and good practices applicable across the Financial and Banking sector  According to input taken by Financial and Banking institutions in EU, Table 13, illustrates the mapping of  security measures to sector specific standards and good practices, such as:   ISO/TR 13569:2005 Financial services -- Information security guidelines31  provides guidelines on  the development of an information security programme for institutions in the financial services  industry. Considerations for the selection and implementation of security controls, and the elements  required to manage information security risk within a modern financial services institution are  discussed.   Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLB Act or GLBA) 32 , also known as the Financial Modernization Act of  1999, is a federal law enacted in the United States to control the ways that financial institutions deal  with the private information of individuals. It requires financial institutions – companies that offer  consumers financial products or services like loans, financial or investment advice, or insurance – to  explain their information-sharing practices to their customers and to safeguard sensitive data.   Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (SOX) 33 is an act passed by U.S. Congress in 2002 to protect investors  from the possibility of fraudulent accounting activities by corporations. The SOX Act mandated strict  reforms to improve financial disclosures from corporations and prevent accounting fraud.  26 http://www.eba.europa.eu/regulation-and-policy/consumer-protection-and-financial-innovation/guidelines-on-the-security-of- internet-payments  27Basel II or International Convergence of Capital Measurement and Capital Standards is a set of recommendations  issued by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision. Basel II is considered by the Basel Committee to be instrumental  in assessments of risk provided by banks’ internal systems as inputs to capital calculations. Its relevance is complicated,  since it is partially dependant on whether or not local governments have adopted it into their local regulations (or if  Basel I has), and how this adoption has occurred.

It takes into account emerging and innovative payment services, such as  internet and mobile payments. It sets out rules concerning strict security requirements for electronic  payments and the protection of consumers' financial data, guaranteeing safe authentication and  reducing the risk of fraud; the transparency of conditions and information requirements for payment  services; the rights and obligations of users and providers of payment services.   Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) 35 is an information security standard for  organizations that handle branded credit cards from the major card schemes. The PCI Standard is  mandated by the card brands and administered by the Payment Card Industry Security Standards  Council. The standard was created to increase controls around cardholder data to reduce credit card  fraud.  34 https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/payment-services-psd-2-directive-eu-2015-2366_en  35 https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/documents/PCI%20SSC%20Quick%20Reference%20Guide.pdf  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/ https://www.facebook.com/ENISAEUAGENCY https://twitter.com/enisa_eu http://www.linkedin.com/company/european-network-and-information-security-agency-enisa- https://www.youtube.com/user/ENISAvideos http://www.enisa.europa.eu/front-page/RSS  Mapping of OES Security Requirements to Specific Sectors  December 2017  30  European Union Agency for Network and Information Security  ENISA -

It  defines guidelines to support the interpretation and implementation in health informatics of ISO/IEC  27002 and is a companion to that International Standard.   Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) 39 required the Secretary of  the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to develop regulations protecting the  privacy and security of certain health information. The Security Standards for the Protection of  Electronic Protected Health Information (the Security Rule) 40 establish a national set of security  standards for protecting certain health information that is held or transferred in electronic form. The  Security Rule operationalizes the protections contained in the Privacy Rule41 by addressing the  technical and non-technical safeguards that organizations called “covered entities” must put in place  to secure individuals’ “electronic protected health information” (e-PHI).  37 http://www.etsi.org/technologies-clusters/technologies/ehealth  38 https://www.iso.org/standard/62777.html  39 https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/security/index.html?language=es  40 https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/privacy/index.html?language=es  41 https://www.awwa.org/store/productdetail.aspx?productid=20779  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/ https://www.facebook.com/ENISAEUAGENCY https://twitter.com/enisa_eu http://www.linkedin.com/company/european-network-and-information-security-agency-enisa- https://www.youtube.com/user/ENISAvideos http://www.enisa.europa.eu/front-page/RSS http://www.etsi.org/technologies-clusters/technologies/ehealth https://www.awwa.org/store/productdetail.aspx?productid=20779  Mapping of OES Security Requirements to Specific Sectors  December 2017  38  European Union Agency for Network and Information Security  ENISA -

The standards and good practices, that are usually applied by the operators of all the sectors referred to in  the NIS Directive, were identified through the survey filled in by the Cooperation Group representatives, as  well as by the feedback provided by EU operators, are:   ISO 27001 Revision 2013, which is the most globally widespread standard covering all aspects of  information security management systems across all the sectors.   ISA/IEC 62443, which is a series of standards that define procedures for implementing electronically  secure Industrial Automation and Control Systems (IACS). This guidance applies to end-users (i.e.  asset owner), system integrators, security practitioners, and control systems manufacturers  responsible for manufacturing, designing, implementing, or managing industrial automation and  control systems.   NIST Cybersecurity Framework, which despite the fact that is not compulsory even in the U.S., it is  usually followed by EU operators that work beyond EU’s territory as it is a good point of reference  for cybersecurity requirements.

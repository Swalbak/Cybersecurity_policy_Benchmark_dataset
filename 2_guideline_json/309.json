The integration of new technology in an already complex IT  infrastructure opens up new challenges regarding data protection and cybersecurity. Moreover,  the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has been a further catalyst for cyberattacks on healthcare  organisations1,2,3. Typical examples are phishing attacks that aim to collect user credentials of  healthcare professionals and ransomware4 against hospitals and other Healthcare  Organisations (HCO).  At the same time this pandemic stresses the need for remote healthcare services, since the  system was overwhelmed in some countries and physical presence was a risk for the spread of  the pandemic. In this context, Cloud solutions have provided elasticity and fast access for the  deployment of new services including «virtual» health and telemedicine.  This study aims to provide Cloud security practices for the healthcare sector and identify  security aspects, including relevant data protection aspects, to be taken into account  when procuring Cloud services for the healthcare industry.  The set of general practices aims to help IT professionals in the healthcare security contexts to  establish and maintain Cloud security while selecting and deploying appropriate technical and  organisational measures. The identification of relevant threats and risks to Cloud services in the  healthcare industry and security and data protection requirements are also covered by the  scope of this report. Further objectives include the presentation of informative and practice-  oriented use cases and their analysis of relevant threats and Cloud security measures.  The overall conclusion derived from the study, is that Cloud integration in the healthcare sector  in the EU is still in its infancy. Some healthcare organisations hesitate to adopt Cloud services,  because they are challenged by a dense and complex legal basis, and new technologies.  Furthermore, the loss of data governance and processing of personal data in the Cloud makes  healthcare organisations hesitant to adopt Cloud services. Other healthcare organisations use  PaaS for connecting medical devices with a web-application for remote monitoring of patients or  SaaS for documentation and scheduling doctor-patient consultations. Some countries are in the  beginning of forming a Government Cloud (G-Cloud) to satisfy such needs. There are also  various government managed services such as electronic prescription and electronic health  records, which run on government-owned resources, such as private Clouds and state owned  datacentres and Clouds.  The study is structured around three use cases, which are the most prominent in using Cloud or  to be using in the future, namely Electronic Health Record, Remote Care and Medical Devices.  A set of 17 security and data protection measures has been identified to be relevant for  ensuring Cloud security and have been assessed based on the use case.  1 https://www.verdict.co.uk/healthcare/  2 https://healthitsecurity.com/news/covid-19-impact-on-ransomware-threats-healthcare-cybersecurity  3 https://healthitsecurity.com/news/the-10-biggest-healthcare-data-breaches-of-2020-so-far  4 https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/alerts/aa20-302a  https://www.verdict.co.uk/healthcare/ https://healthitsecurity.com/news/covid-19-impact-on-ransomware-threats-healthcare-cybersecurity https://healthitsecurity.com/news/the-10-biggest-healthcare-data-breaches-of-2020-so-far https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/alerts/aa20-302a  CLOUD SECURITY FOR HEALTHCARE SERVICES  January 2021  8  1. INTRODUCTION  1.1 CONTEXT OF THE REPORT  The healthcare sector is one of the sectors most vulnerable to cyber attacks5. Simultaneously,  the digitalisation of the healthcare sector is moving forward, and digital solutions or electronic  records continuously replace paper-based processes. The transformation affects services along  the complete healthcare delivery chain, i.e. medication, appointment scheduling, patient  records, inpatient and outpatient care as well as inpatient and remote monitoring or self-  management.  Digitalisation offers new solutions to improve patient care and gain operational excellence in  healthcare organisations. Cloud solutions for healthcare services offer an excellent opportunity  to increase operational efficiency, cut costs on IT expenditure and improve cybersecurity and  data protection. This is since Cloud service providers have resources such as personnel,  knowledge of technology, and the financial means to improve cybersecurity and data protection  continuously. These are the same factors that sometimes have proven to hinder advances in  the maturity of data protection and cybersecurity at healthcare organisations.  The COVID-19 pandemic has pushed Cloud-based technology usage in the healthcare sector,  especially in telemedicine, for patient-doctor consultations and artificial intelligence for triaging  purposes. The further integration of Cloud computing services in the healthcare sector also  raises security and data protection concerns. This report therefore aims to help ensure Cloud  security for healthcare.  1.2 OBJECTIVE  This report's overall objective is to provide the target audience with a set of guidelines to ensure  cybersecurity and security of personal data processing when procuring Cloud services for  providing healthcare services and a clear understanding of the corresponding responsibilities.  The goals are to provide an overview of the landscape of the applicable EU legislative  instruments relevant to Cloud services in the healthcare sector and the main cybersecurity and  data protection challenges, relevant to security of personal data processing, of Cloud customers  from the healthcare sector.  1.3 SCOPE  The study's scope is Cloud services that support the broader eHealth ecosystem, such as  healthcare services and facilities, medical devices and equipment, medical services, or  managed care. It is not limited to a specific Cloud architecture, neither deployment nor service  model. The study focuses on showing relevant threats, measures, and responsibility by  analysing three representative use cases, electronic health record, remote care, and medical  devices.  The set of guidelines for Cloud security of healthcare services (output) is primarily for Cloud  customers, such as healthcare organisations or medical device manufacturers. The study,  investigation, and the output are centred on the European Union and European Free Trade  Association (EFTA) member states.  5 IBM, X-Force Threat Intelligence Index, 2020, pp. 39., see also Moore, J., Which sectors are most vulnerable to cyber  attacks, 2020. https://www.ifsecglobal.com/cyber-security/which-sectors-are-most-vulnerable-to-cyber attacks/  COVID-19  pandemic  indicated how  vulnerable the  healthcare  sector is to  cyberattacks  and the need for  “tele” medicine  also as a more  secure solution.  https://www.ifsecglobal.com/cyber-security/which-sectors-are-most-vulnerable-to-cyber%20attacks/  CLOUD SECURITY FOR HEALTHCARE SERVICES  January 2021  9  1.4 TARGET AUDIENCE  The target audience of the study’s output acceptable practices for ensuring Cloud security for  healthcare services is anyone interested in using Cloud technology in the healthcare sector.  The main focus is on Cloud customers in healthcare, primarily:   IT health professionals (CISO, CIO, IT procurement specialists, and IT-teams in charge  of purchasing Cloud services)   Healthcare professionals in managerial positions seeking advice on whether to procure  Cloud services  The report may be useful to IT professionals from medical device manufacturers and possibly,  policymakers and Cloud service providers.  1.5 METHODOLOGY  The applied methodology of this study comprises four steps.   Step 1 Desk Research: Extensive desk research for gathering information identifying  Cloud services supporting healthcare services, Cloud security threats, and security  controls for providing Cloud security for healthcare in general and during the  procuring process.   Step 2 Questionnaire and semi-structured interviews: Experts and  representatives from the healthcare and Cloud technology industry of ENISA’s expert  network have provided information on Cloud-based healthcare services, its  associated risks and opportunities, Cloud security and cybersecurity requirements in  general, and implemented or identified cybersecurity and data protection measures  from their point of view. Interviews have been conducted to collect additional valuable  input from the experts.   Step 3 Analysis: The analysis of the results from step 1 and step 2 provides input for  the report and its objectives. This step supports the identification of security  challenges and the validation of the use cases. Based on the analysis results, the first  draft of the report has been drafted.   Step 4 Review and validation: The last step comprises the review and validation by  ENISA’s expert group. The final version of the report is drafted, taking into account  the feedback from the experts.  1.6 STRUCTURE OF THE DOCUMENT  The report is structured as follows:   Section 1 – Introduction provides introductory information on the report and  describes the scope, objectives, target audience, and the applied methodology.   Section 2 – Cloud Services in Healthcare outlines Cloud service terminology,  characteristics, and responsibilities. It includes an overview of Cloud services in  healthcare identified through desk research and interviews.   Section 3 – Cybersecurity considerations in Cloud for Healthcare entails  cybersecurity and data protection considerations for the use of Cloud for healthcare  services. It also includes a threat taxonomy based on the ENISA procurement guide.   Section 4 – Use cases shows a description of the possible use cases, the factors to  be considered when conducting the respective risk analyses in terms of risk likelihood  and impact, and appropriate security measures, relevant to personal data processing,  for risk mitigation.   Section 5 – Cloud security measures in healthcare lists and presents measures  for ensuring Cloud security for healthcare services, including additional data  protection considerations.  CLOUD SECURITY FOR HEALTHCARE SERVICES  January 2021  10  2. HEALTHCARE IN THE  CLOUD  2.1 POLICY CONTEXT  Legislation plays an important role in defining cybersecurity requirements and adopting  cybersecurity and data protection related measures. In the case of healthcare and the Cloud,  the policy landscape at national or European level is still at early stages of development. Very  few MS have Cloud-related guidelines specifically for the healthcare sector, simply because if  Cloud security guidance is in place, it applies to all critical sectors; all Member States consider  healthcare a critical sector.  The general conclusion derived from the desk research and expert interviews shows that MS  have a dedicated legislation for healthcare activities (not necessarily covering cybersecurity)  and in several cases they adopt cybersecurity guidelines for Cloud computing; there is no case  of healthcare and Cloud specific legislation. This corresponds to the assessment of the  healthcare sector as critical, thus required to abide by overall cybersecurity legislations and  guidelines.  At the same time, identification of requirements deriving from national or European legislation,  proves crucial when procuring Cloud services. Some healthcare services, electronic health  records for instance, have a separate law entailing security and data protection requirements.  And eventually, to some extent the general practices overlap.  The illustration below depicts the legislative situation regarding Cloud security and healthcare.  From a legal requirements perspective, we examined four topic-related dimensions: privacy,  cybersecurity, Cloud security, and healthcare.  Figure 1: Legislations related to Cloud security and healthcare  CLOUD SECURITY FOR HEALTHCARE SERVICES  January 2021  11  The most relevant legal documents or guidelines at EU level are summarised below.  2.1.1 The Network and Information Security Directive (NISD)  The Network and Information Security Directive (NISD) 2016/1148/EU6, which came into force in  May 2018, has two main goals: the implementation of minimum security requirements and the  establishment of cybersecurity notifications for both Operators of Essential Services and Digital  Service Providers. Healthcare providers, namely hospitals, are identified as Operators of  Essential Services in most Member States. At the same time Cloud Service Providers are  considered Digital Service Providers. Therefore, both these types of organisations will have to  take the Directive and the relevant national law into account when contracting a Cloud service.  The Directive goes beyond implementation of security requirements, as it gives power to the  regulatory bodies to audit the Operators of Essential Services to ensure the level of  cybersecurity in the organisation is acceptable and as per the provisions of the Directive. At the  same time, the Directive puts in scope specific services which span among the designated  essential sectors. In the healthcare ecosystem, this can be translated as cybersecurity  requirements for all products so it should be included as a provision in the procurement  process.  For the Digital Service Providers, the decision on the details of cybersecurity measures resides  with the MS, since the Directive leaves a certain level of flexibility. In the case of Cloud services  offered to an operator of essential healthcare service, both parties need to agree on how the  legal requirements will be met before reaching a contractual agreement.  2.1.2 General Data Protection Regulation  The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)7 came into force on 25 May 2018. It sets the  rules for the processing and free movement of personal data and applies to all domains of the  public and private sector; however, some specific derogations are defined for data concerning  health, aimed at protecting the rights of data subjects and confidentiality of their personal health  data and at the same time preserving the benefits of data processing for research and public  health purposes.  The GDPR considers health data as a \"special category\" of personal data which are considered  to be sensitive by nature and imposes a higher standard of protection for their processing.  Organisations (Data controllers) processing health data have the following obligations (among  others):   to implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure security of  the processing systems, services and personal data,   to perform data protection impact assessment, and   to report data breaches which are likely to result in a risk to the rights and freedoms of  individuals within 72 hours after having become aware of them.  The GDPR expanded the scope of application of EU data protection law requirements to the  data processors as well. This means that Cloud service providers, acting as data processors on  behalf of the data controller, have obligations as data controllers but their obligations would not  necessarily be the same.  2.1.3 Non regulatory guidelines  Prior to the adoption of GDPR, in 2012, the European Data Protection Supervisor (EDPS) had  issued an opinion on the use of Cloud Computing and provided guidance indicating security  measures for data protection but also sharing considerations in respect to responsibilities  6 https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/dir/2016/1148/oj  7 https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2016/679/oj  https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/dir/2016/1148/oj https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2016/679/oj  CLOUD SECURITY FOR HEALTHCARE SERVICES  January 2021  12  between data processor and data controller. This can be used as a basis for Cloud security  requirements solicitation from the healthcare sectors as well.  In 2015, the Joint Action to Support the eHealth Network (JASEHN) issued a report8 on the use  of Cloud computing in health focusing primarily on the secondary use of health data where  amongst other explains the responsibility shift between the HCO and the CSP based on the  service model (IaaS, PaaS, SaaS etc).  In 2018, the European Data Protection Board (EDPB) and the EDPS issued an opinion9  specifically for healthcare namely on data protection for eHealth Digital Service Infrastructure  compiled under the directive on patients’ rights to cross-border healthcare. Amongst other  things, the opinion includes requirements for more secure information exchange (i.e.  encryption), secure data storage and that the EC, as data processor, has to clarify the  governing rules of the processing.  2.2 CLOUD COMPUTING BASICS  2.2.1 Cloud Services  As per previous ENISA publications10, the basic types of Cloud services can be explained in the  following diagram:  Figure 2: Basic types of Cloud services  Interpreting the diagram from left to right:   Infrastructure as a Service: In IaaS, the provider delivers computing resources (virtual  hardware), accessible online. The software providing access to the resources is called  the hypervisor. Generally speaking there are two types of resources: processing power  8 https://webgate.ec.europa.eu/chafea_pdb/health/projects/677102/outputs  9 https://edps.europa.eu/data-protection/our-work/publications/opinions/edpb-edps-joint-opinion-ehdsi_en  10 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/cloud-and-big-data  https://webgate.ec.europa.eu/chafea_pdb/health/projects/677102/outputs https://edps.europa.eu/data-protection/our-work/publications/opinions/edpb-edps-joint-opinion-ehdsi_en https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/cloud-and-big-data  CLOUD SECURITY FOR HEALTHCARE SERVICES  January 2021  13  (including network resources), and (block) storage (memory resources). Examples  include Amazon’s Elastic Compute Cloud, Google’s Compute Engine, Amazon Simple  Storage Service, Dropbox, Rackspace, etc. Note that object storage services (e.g.  Dropbox) are often considered SaaS.   Platform as a Service: In PaaS, the provider delivers a platform, or more precisely,  application servers, for customers to run applications on. PaaS providers sometimes  provide a software development tool for the platform. Examples of applications running  on these platforms are scripts (PHP, Python, e.g.) or byte code (Java servlets, C#).  Examples include Google App engine, Microsoft Azure, Amazon Elastic Beanstalk, etc.   Software as a Service: In SaaS, the provider delivers full-fledged software or  applications, via the internet. Applications range from email servers, document editors,  customer relationship management systems, and so on. SaaS services can often be  accessed with a browser or a web services client. Note that it is not uncommon for  SaaS providers to run their applications on an IaaS or PaaS from another provider. An  example is the video streaming site Netflix (SaaS) which runs on Amazon AWS  computing services (PaaS/IaaS).   Facilities denote the physical structures and supplies such as networks, cooling,  power, etc.   Organisation denotes the human resources, the policies and procedures for  maintaining the facilities and supporting the delivery of the services.  2.2.2 Cloud Deployment models  Private Cloud is a model in which one customer has exclusive access to the Cloud  infrastructure and computational resources, that can be hosted by the customer itself or a  provider, over a private network.  Public Cloud refers to a shared Cloud infrastructure and computational resources that are  available and reachable over the public internet.  Hybrid Cloud is a model for a group of users that share the same Cloud infrastructure and the  computational resource. The premises may be owned, managed, and operated by one or more  of the organisations in the community, a third party, or both. It may exist on the community’s  location (on-site) or the third-party’s location (off-site).  Governmental Cloud (g-Cloud) is a Cloud environment where the Cloud infrastructure is  owned, governed and run by the government or a state-owned entity using own resources or a  selected third-party provider. In addition, the governmental Cloud enables the public body to  provide services to public sector stakeholders, to citizens and enterprises.  For the purpose of this report, the definition of governmental Cloud is presented based on  ENISA’s reports11.  2.2.3 Division of responsibilities  Similarly depending on the service model selected, the responsibilities might lie either on the  side of the customer or of the provider; the higher you move in the service stack as a customer  the fewer technical responsibilities one has to implement. Note that this diagram is for  illustration only and does not provide an exhaustive list of security processes on the provider’s  or the customer’s side. In specific settings there may be specific agreements about the  11 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/cloud-and-big-data/cloud-security  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/cloud-and-big-data/cloud-security  CLOUD SECURITY FOR HEALTHCARE SERVICES  January 2021  14  outsourcing of security tasks. An IaaS provider, for example, might have a service for patching  the Operating System (OS) of customers. Sometimes such services are offered by a third-party  (and this is also known as Security-As-A-Service or SECaaS).  At this point, it needs to be stressed that cybersecurity is always a shared responsibility- so  regardless of the service model acquired, the customer always has a role in the cybersecurity or  privacy requirements adoption.  Figure 3: Division of responsibilities of Cloud services  From the data protection perspective, the definitions and most likely assignment of roles are as  follows:   Data controller: “the natural or legal person, public authority, agency or other body  which, alone or jointly with others, determines the purposes and means of the  processing of personal data” GDPR Art. 4(7).   Data processor: “a natural or legal person, public authority, agency or other body  which processes personal data on behalf of the controller” GDPR Art. 4 (7).  Depending on the service model (IaaS/PaaS/SaaS), the data processor might be the  CSP or the customer. The higher a healthcare organisation moves up the Cloud  services stack, the more processing power the Cloud provider has.  2.3 TYPES OF CLOUD SERVICES IN HEALTHCARE  In the healthcare sector, Cloud solutions exist for different healthcare services and their number  is increasing. In this chapter, we provide a non-exhaustive overview of the currently identified  Cloud solutions for healthcare systems. These solutions may come in different cloud service  types (e.g. SaaS, PaaS etc.) or cloud deployment models. The following descriptions focus  primarily on the types of functions and services supported by existing cloud services as  opposed to the deployment models and relevant architectures.  CLOUD SECURITY FOR HEALTHCARE SERVICES  January 2021  15  Table 1: Non-exhaustive overview of the currently identified Cloud solutions for healthcare systems  Type of cloud services  Description  Enterprise resource  planning systems  (ERP systems)  Enterprise resources planning systems support the management of patients, appointments, medical  staff’s schedules and inventory. Dedicated parts of an ERP system could be available as Cloud- based solutions, for instance:   Patient management system   Health insurance management   Billing and human resource management   Other non-clinical data management  Health information  systems (HIS)  Health information systems are used for managing healthcare data and entail demographic and  medical patient data, which comprise records, images, or even videos. In the area of health  information systems, the following types are available or used as a Cloud-based solution:   Electronic health record (EHR)   Picture archiving and communication system (PACS)   Electronic prescription information system   Radiology information system (RIS)   Laboratory information system (LIS)   Clinical decision support (CDS)   Remote patient monitoring (RPM)  Communication  services  Middleware is a communication service to transfer data between systems or devices with a different  physical location. For instance, in a Cloud-based solution for a remote monitoring solution, only the  transfer from the device to the electronic health record is Cloud-based with the medical data being  stored at a data storage facility in the healthcare organisation.  Office management  Healthcare organisations use Cloud-based file servers for document archiving or mail servers for  internal and external communication.  Cloud-based network  Cloud-based networks enable healthcare organisations to share infrastructure on an as-needed  basis; therefore, having more flexibility if more resources in particular situations are required.  Health data analytics  Health data analytics need a lot of computing power. Healthcare organisations outsource this task  with Cloud technologies.  Artificial intelligence12, machine learning is used to support medical research, diagnosis (e.g. cancer13  or cardiac pathology14), data analysis (e.g. glucose measurement), treatment recommendation, and  patient engagement. The use of Cloud computing technology for this area is continuously evaluated.  Medical devices  Medical devices identify data that can be accessed through a mobile app or a web-based platform  from different stakeholders. The healthcare services provided using Cloud-based medical devices are  blood pressure measurement using electronic stethoscope15, glucose measurement, and  electrocardiogram. The goal is to enable patients to measure heart rates or insulin level at home while  the data is directly available to healthcare professionals for treating or scheduling an appointment.  Diagnostic cameras that support healthcare professionals during the diagnosis also belong to this  category.  Telemedicine services  Telemedicine is a healthcare service provided using telecommunication technology. The areas of  application comprise of teleconsultation and tele assistance using conference or video-conference  tools.  Medication monitoring  Medication assistance16 supports patients following their medication through real-time monitoring. It is  a further remote healthcare technology application17 together with telemedicine and medical devices.  Supply chain  management  Supply Chain Management guarantees the timely availability of safe medical devices for use in the  healthcare processes. This includes equipment, implants, disposables and medical software.  12 Davenport and Kalakota, 2019  13 Junaid Ahmad, Vinai, Bilal, 2015 and Sadhasivam, Balamurugan, and Pandi, 2018  14 Agliari et al., 2020  15 Leng et al. 2015  16 Ventsislav and Rosen, 2016  17 Cavoukian et al., 2010  CLOUD SECURITY FOR HEALTHCARE SERVICES  January 2021  16  3. CYBERSECURITY  CONSIDERATIONS IN CLOUD  FOR HEALTHCARE  3.1 CLOUD SECURITY CHALLENGES FOR HEALTHCARE  In this section, we present the main challenges regarding Cloud security, derived from the input  of different experts collected through interviews. Even if the list is not exhaustive, the identified  challenges comprise trends and obstacles regarding cybersecurity and data protection of the  healthcare sector and the risks from Cloud-based healthcare services.   Lack of trust of Cloud solutions: Overall, it has become evident that stakeholders in  the healthcare sector (patients, physicians, medical staff, and healthcare organisation  management) indicated a lack of trust of Cloud solutions. For example, patients'  concern for their medical data being stored at the facilities Cloud service provider is  often reduced due to the pre-existing relationship of trust between patient and doctor  and due to the higher valuation of the patient’s health over data protection and  cybersecurity. In the case of medical staff, they tend to be less aware of cybersecurity  and data protection. Therefore, it is a challenge to raise awareness for security-related  topics and train in new authentication or identification technology. Also, human  resources do nοt need to necessarily understand security and technologies- however  they should be aware of the offerings of the Cloud providers in terms of that expertise.  Without training and education, the occurrence of human errors and social engineering  attacks is more likely.   Lack of security and technology expertise: Moving the entire IT infrastructure or  individual services from on site to the Cloud requires human resources that understand  Cloud technologies and the associated security and data protection aspects. These  knowledge requirements may not be covered by the same IT personnel responsible for  the on-site infrastructure and eventually result in job termination. To migrate back from  the Cloud to on-site infrastructure may be more challenging under such circumstances.  Furthermore, the demand for Cloud security experts for the healthcare sector is higher  than its supply, hindering Cloud computing advancement.   Cybersecurity investment is not a priority: A lack of healthcare organisation  management support or restricted public financing results in less financial support to  further promote the digitalisation and to increase cybersecurity and data protection  maturity in the healthcare sector.   Proving regulatory compliance of the CSP:  In several cases, Cloud customers  have difficulty identifying which Cloud service provider is compliant with their set of  legal requirements which sometimes limits their options for CSP collaboration.  Assessment by the cloud customer of the Cloud provider’s compliance is rarely  possible or only with considerable financial resources. However, many CSPs provide  this publicly via their compliance websites, and is often backed up from independent  3rd parties or even, sometimes, through government certification/assurance programs.  In the other hand, regulatory requirements are so complex when it comes to  healthcare-related data that CSPs do not even include these types of customers in  their business model.  CLOUD SECURITY FOR HEALTHCARE SERVICES  January 2021  17   Integration of Cloud with legacy systems difficulties: The integration of Cloud  solutions with already existing healthcare organisation infrastructure or connecting  several devices in-house and cross border, involves a great challenge and even results  in refraining from using Cloud services. Moreover, in most cases, legacy systems are a  part of health IT infrastructure. These systems are not supported by updates from their  suppliers, which complicates integration and interoperability with new technology.  Consequently, this makes these systems vulnerable to cybersecurity attacks. Hybrid  deployment models allow a mix of health IT systems to partner with CSP  services/solutions to deliver the most customizable needs to health care organisations.  At the same time, the cost of deploying extra security features or integrating security  elements with the on premise security perimeter is very high.  3.2 DATA PROTECTION CHALLENGES IN THE CLOUD  Similarly, in this section we present the main data protection-related challenges as derived from  interviews with experts focusing mostly on the technical requirements for Cloud services in  healthcare:   Privacy by design techniques: The healthcare provider needs to understand whether  the Cloud provider has followed a privacy-by-design approach (both policies and  measures) when developing and deploying the service. The GDPR introduces a legal  requirement on privacy by design and by default for both data controllers and data  processors. Some of the techniques mentioned are minimising the processing of  personal data, pseudonymising personal data as soon as possible, transparency with  regard to the functions and processing of personal data, enabling the data subject to  monitor the data processing and enabling the controller to create and improve security  features. Such approaches and strategies can be achieved through the use of  particular technologies and policies, such as authentication, attribute-based  credentials, secure private communications, anonymity and pseudonymity, statistical  disclosure control, privacy preserving computations, and others18.   Data management: Healthcare organisations as authorised parties (after receiving  consent) collect, structure and manage patient data. In some cases the information is  automatically transferred to the Cloud (i.e. from a medical device) or it is input by a  delegated party (i.e. medical practitioner). Depending on the type of service in the  Cloud, the input information might be created by a different actor making accuracy of  information a great issue. Controls for ensuring data accuracy should be in place, even  if performed by third parties. Organisations need to establish their own data  governance model/frameworks for understanding what kind of data is the most  sensitive and then applying the required level of controls. Another issue to consider is  interoperability, specifically for healthcare. This is a sector where Cloud computing  brings many benefits due to its flexible range of services.   Data deletion: It is extremely important to be able to erase data after retention time  has expired, but also upon data subject’s request without undue delay. The data  subjects can substantiate their requests with one of the grounds foreseen in GDPR,  such as when the data is no longer necessary for the initial purpose or when the data  subject withdraws consent. Cloud providers have partially addressed the issue of  identifying storage areas of chunks of information (data tagging). However, effective  deletion of data is still a technical challenge.   Data portability: This challenge goes hand in hand with vendor lock-in, the most  common risk regarding Cloud Computing. Data portability refers to the transfer of one’s  18 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/big-data-protection  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/big-data-protection  CLOUD SECURITY FOR HEALTHCARE SERVICES  January 2021  18  data from one provider to another without loss upon their request. For healthcare  certain standards are in place (like HL7) to ensure interoperability and thus portability.   Encryption: One of the most important and at the same time difficult measures to  implement is encryption. It is important to ensure secrecy and integrity but it has to be  applied in all the different channels of data transfer and storage. Encryption measures  need to be implemented at both client and server level but also in the channel that  connects them. Responsibility then resides in both the Cloud customer and the Cloud  provider and has huge implications from a technical and legal perspective. At the same  time, few CSPs share the encryption keys with their customer leaving full control to the  provider.  3.3 CYBERSECURITY THREATS  Following the threat taxonomy of ENISA’s procurement guide19 (ENISA, 2020), this section  shows how the specific cybersecurity in healthcare can have implications for Cloud services.  Table 2: Cybersecurity Threats in healthcare and implications for Cloud services  High-level threat Threat Description  Natural phenomena Fire, floods or earthquakes  Natural forces affect the Cloud infrastructure and eventually  could result in a destruction of relevant systems, network  components, or devices. Although the threat probability is low,  the impact might be huge.  Supply chain failure Cloud service provider failure  The Cloud services’ availability is highly dependent on the Cloud  service provider. Bankruptcy of the Cloud service provider, for  instance, may threaten the continuous availability of the Cloud  service, which may cause operational outages of healthcare  organisations due to service failure. In the case of the Cloud  provider’s failure, a lack of data export and portability may result  in loss of data. For all supply chain threats, redundancy and  resiliency are critical topics the healthcare organisations should  consider and inquire about.  Supply chain failure Network provider failure  Network connection is crucial to access Cloud services. A  network failure may impact Cloud-based healthcare service  provision and affect the collaboration between different internal  and external partners.  Supply chain failure Power supply failure  Power supply can affect the Cloud service's availability, which  may be critical when a pacemaker's data cannot be observed.  Human errors  Lack of tracing back  functionality  Logs of activities in the Cloud service enable accountability,  serve as evidence in the event of security incidents, and are used  to investigate the causes of security incidents. The Cloud  customer needs to ensure that logging is enabled based on risk.  It also provides transparency for patients in the case of electronic  health records.  Human errors  Unauthorised data access  (information leakage)  Cloud users may gain unauthorised access to data due to  insufficient access management or lack of awareness, which  causes unintentional data disclosure. For example, a Cloud- based electronic health record has more users than a  telemedicine solution.  Human errors Non-compliance  Nowadays, the bring-your-own-device policy is widely applied in  the healthcare sector, which causes variation in endpoint  security. Measures to secure endpoints need to be adopted, and  impacts on compliance, especially for accessing electronic health  records, should be analysed.  19 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/good-practices-for-the-security-of-healthcare-services  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/good-practices-for-the-security-of-healthcare-services  CLOUD SECURITY FOR HEALTHCARE SERVICES  January 2021  19  High-level threat Threat Description  Human errors Unintentional change of data  Entering incorrect data into a healthcare system can result in loss  of integrity and data disclosure to unauthorised users, such as  uploading medical documents to the wrong electronic health  record.  Human errors  Errors by Cloud service  administrators/support staff  If data is not appropriately deleted from a Cloud storage or the  backup media, the data may be accessed later by another Cloud  customer of the same Cloud provider, and eventually result in a  data breach. Configuration errors by Cloud service support staff  may also leave vulnerabilities unpatched and leave entry points  open for malicious attackers.  Malicious action  Malware injection attacks (i.e.  virus, ransomware, worms)  Cloud environments are susceptible to malware injection attacks,  which are a subcategory of web-based attacks. Attackers exploit  vulnerabilities of a web application and embed malicious code  into the normal action course. All Cloud service models are  equally vulnerable to this kind of malicious action. Once the  malicious code is executed, the attacker may eavesdrop,  manipulate or steal data and instigate further attacks.  Malicious action Hijacking  Hijacking infrastructure of the Cloud service provider to mine  cryptocurrency (crypto-jacking) or a medical device (med-jacking)  affects the patient’s safety or the performance of the Cloud  service healthcare provision. Hyper-jacking refers to hijacking the  hypervisor using a virtual machine-based rootkit. Successful  compromise of the hypervisor grants access to the entire  machine and allows the compromise of the virtual machine.  Malicious action  Social Engineering attacks i.e.  Phishing  Social engineering attacks to steal user credentials for SaaS  solutions through phishing, spam, or spear-phishing emails are  always targeted at the weakest link in the security chain, the  human. On the whole, the healthcare sector is commonly known  as less IT savvy and this raises the exposure to cyberattacks.  Strong authentication provided by the Cloud service provider  helps to prevent these kinds of attacks. Successful attacks could  result in data breaches, data leakage, or data theft.  Malicious action Account hijacking20  Account hijacking results from a malicious attacker gaining  access to privileged accounts or sensitive accounts, such as  Cloud service accounts or subscriptions. This threat can result in  severe disruption of Cloud services and the provision of  healthcare services.  Malicious action  Insecure interfaces and  application programming  interfaces  A Cloud computing environment provides user interfaces and  APIs to interconnect devices and interact with the Cloud service.  These interfaces offer an entry point for malicious attackers if  they are poorly designed and lack security measures such as  encryption and access control. Broken or hacked API’s may  result in data breaches.  Malicious action Insider threat  Insiders can be current or former employees of healthcare  organisations, contractors, or other trusted partners, who gain  access from the inside of an organisation. These parties have  had authorized access and may negatively affect the Cloud  service and ultimately result in a data breach.  Malicious action  Isolation failure (Multi- tenancy)  In shared environments, errors or attacks may provide one tenant  with access to another tenant's resources or data. A malicious  attacker may gain access to one specific Cloud customer's  resources or data or even all Cloud customers resulting in data  breaches.  20 Cloud Security Alliance, 2020  CLOUD SECURITY FOR HEALTHCARE SERVICES  January 2021  20  High-level threat Threat Description  Malicious action  Abuse of Cloud computational  resources  Common examples of Cloud computing resource misuse are  launching denial of service attacks, mining cryptocurrency,  starting to propagate phishing or spam emails, and hosting  malicious content in the Cloud environment. The abuse may  affect Cloud services’ availability or performance harming a  patient’s health.  Malicious action Denial of service  Denial of service attacks against the Cloud service overload its  resources due to a flood of requests originating from many  sources and cause its unavailability and inability to process  requests.  Malicious action  Intercepting data in transit  (Man-in-the middle attack)  In a Cloud architecture model, data is transferred from the Cloud  customer to the Cloud service provider. During transition, it may  be intercepted and eventually result in a data breach.  Malicious action Mobile application attacks21  Vulnerability in mobile apps running in the Cloud may also leave  entry points open to be exploited by malicious attackers and  result in data disclosure to unauthorised persons or even data  loss.  System Failure  Network-related technical  failures or attacks  Technical failures of network-related components influence the  availability of Cloud service. Examples include the loss of Internet  connectivity due to failures at the Cloud customer’s or service  provider’s site, a temporary reduction of network bandwidth at the  Cloud customer’s internet service provider, which affects the data  transfer from and to the Cloud service provider, and disruptions  in the global Internet routing infrastructure capping the  connection between the Cloud customer and Cloud service  provider.  System Failure  Insufficient maintenance and  maintenance procedures  Insufficient patch or life cycle management may occur at the  Cloud customer's and the Cloud provider's sites. Failing to  maintain the Cloud infrastructure and leaving software unpatched  may result in disturbances or even failure of the Cloud service.  Eventually, the patient's health may be affected due to  unavailable medical records.  System Failure Software failure  Due to errors, software failure can affect the Cloud services or  medical device data availability and eventually endanger patient  safety.  System Failure Hardware failure  Failure of IT hardware at the Cloud service provider's or  customer's site, limiting the Cloud service's availability, may  severely impact patients' health in emergency cases.  A medical device failure affects real-time data availability in the  Cloud service possibly harming the patient's health.  System Failure  Deployment/ configuration  Error  Technical failure related to system misconfiguration or  interoperability issues in deployment. A cloud migration is a data  centre migration, and it brings along all of the complexities that  traditionally go along with one.  21 OWASP, 2016  CLOUD SECURITY FOR HEALTHCARE SERVICES  January 2021  21  4. USE CASES  In this section, three use cases of Cloud services for healthcare are shown, including a  reference Cloud architecture, factors to be considered during risk assessment, and risk  mitigation measures.  4.1 USE CASE 1 - ELECTRONIC HEALTH RECORD  An electronic health record (EHR) provides services to a wide range of potential users: patients,  doctors, nurses, public health officials, and more. These systems collect, store, manage and  transmit sensitive health data such as patients’ contact details, social insurance numbers,  medical examinations’ results, pathologies, allergies, diagnosis, and treatment plan. Healthcare  professionals are provided with an overview of the history and the status of the patients’ health  and can access it if needed from pre-defined terminals within the healthcare provider’s  premises. After each examination or consultation, patient records are updated with the latest  data by the treating doctor or nurse either by scanning paper-based documents or manually  diagnosing and treatment plans.  Paper-based documents containing patient data are increasingly replaced with EHR in many  countries, allowing health information to be shared in an easy-to-use and standardised way  between different stakeholders such as healthcare professionals and patients. Solutions in this  area often involve the use of Cloud computing resources or partially Cloud-based components.  Patients can access and manage their EHR through a patient portal, which is usually integrated  into Cloud solutions22.  Figure 1: Cloud Architecture Model - Electronic Health Record (EHR)  22 This is an exemplar case as not every EHR deployment uses governmental Clouds provided by the respective ministry. It  is very common to see regional EHR deployments operated on public or private Clouds by public or private EHR providers.  An EHR is typically sourced as SaaS and not at IaaS level but for the sake of completeness in this report, the specific  service model is selected for the EHR.  CLOUD SECURITY FOR HEALTHCARE SERVICES  January 2021  22  OVERVIEW  Service Model IaaS Deployment model Governmental Cloud  Healthcare organisation network  The healthcare organisation network is the Cloud customer of  the governmental IaaS Cloud service provider. It is the body  responsible for developing, maintaining, and deploying the  application for sharing electronic patient records. Healthcare  organisations upload the patient EHRs either through the web  application or through an API, connecting their clinical  information system with the corresponding national data centre  in the Cloud. EHRs are stored at the national datacentre.  Patients access their health records through the web  application.  Cloud service provider  The ministry of health, a government institution, provides the  physical infrastructure for storing the EHRs. That includes,  amongst others, the maintenance of the network infrastructure  and the underlying operating systems.  DEFINITION OF PROCESSING OPERATION AND ITS CONTEXT  Personal data processed  Contact information (patient’s last and first name, address, telephone number, email address),  contact information of relatives for emergency cases, social insurance number, medical  appointments, medical examination results, pathologies, allergies, diagnosis and treatment  plans (medical information), administrative and financial information (invoices, hospitalisation  papers, etc.).  Processing Purpose  Provision of healthcare services (diagnosis, treatment, hospitalisation), treatment planning and  billing  Data Subject Patients, relatives, doctors, nurses  Recipients of the Data Doctors and nurses, administration and accounting department, public health system, patients  Data Processor  IaaS Cloud service provider  ASSESSING CYBERSECURITY RISK IMPACT  When conducting a risk assessment for similar use cases, healthcare organisations should take  into account the possible impact of a cybersecurity incident on confidentiality (e.g. data breach  leading to exposed patient data), integrity (e.g. alteration of important patient data) or availability  (e.g. timely access to patient data during emergency treatment). This would allow the healthcare  organisation to assign an appropriate quantitative or qualitative value to the risk impact  depending on the specific risk assessment methodology used. A brief description of factors to  be considered for risk impact assessment is listed below:  Factor Description  Confidentiality  Within the scope of the specific processing operation, the impact from loss of confidentiality is considerable  given the nature of sensitive information included in the EHR. Data subjects could be expected to encounter  significant adverse effects from unauthorised disclosure of their health data.  Integrity  The impact in case of loss of integrity should be considered particularly if the EHR includes important patient  data that may be used to influence medical decisions. Data subjects may encounter significant or even  irreversible consequences from unauthorised alteration of health data (signals and statistics), which could  even make it difficult for them to receive appropriate treatment.  Availability  Depending on the nature of data included in the EHR and the context of their use, loss of availability may also  be of significant impact. Inability to access the patient’s EHR may hinder timely and accurate treatment of the  data subjects, even putting their lives at risk.  CLOUD SECURITY FOR HEALTHCARE SERVICES  January 2021  23  ASSESSING RISK LIKELIHOOD  The table below describes how the main Cloud security threats may be relevant for the  reference Cloud architecture and the specific use case. Healthcare organisations should use  the information below when assessing the likelihood of a cybersecurity risk. It should however  be noted that the descriptions below only refer to the described use case and additional factors  related to the operational context of the healthcare organisation should be considered before  determining the risk likelihood.  Threat Description  Natural  phenomena  Typically, in such use cases the servers are located in data centres enforcing a suitable level of physical  security requirements, which tends to reduce the respective risk likelihood. Such data centres usually obtain  certificates that show that they are protected against fire, water, or earthquakes and the existence of such  certificates should be factored in the risk likelihood assessment.  Supply chain  failure  As the infrastructure is outsourced to Cloud providers the likelihood of this risk tends to be reduced. The failure  of power supply or other Cloud service disruptions is less likely because the providers are specialised in  maintaining their services. However, even big Cloud platforms are not entirely immune to outages of their Cloud  infrastructure.  Human error An undefined number of employees may be performing personal data processing, and there is no clear policy  regarding granular access to health records. This should be considered as a factor that increases risk  likelihood. Human actors' common mistakes in this use case are the usage of default or weak passwords, lack  of access control to sensitive data, non-compliance with security policies, or the possibility of human error.  However, the obligations of all parties involved in the process should be clearly defined, and awareness-raising  seminars should be organised periodically.  Malicious  actions  Many parties such as healthcare organisations, patients, and public health officials are strongly interconnected in  this Cloud system, which is difficult to isolate from malicious actors completely. Malicious attackers may also be  internal actors who might have direct or indirect access to the Cloud services. Potential attacks in this area might  involve social engineering (e.g., phishing), theft, espionage, malware (e.g., ransomware), or denial of service  attacks. A database containing electronic health records of almost every citizen in a specific country stored  centrally may be an attractive target for malicious attackers. On the other hand, Cloud service providers can  bundle the knowledge of internal and external security experts, which allows them to enforce security measures  more efficiently than proprietary data centres. These factors and especially the operational context of the  healthcare organisation and the Cloud service provider should be assessed when determining the risk likelihood.  System  failures  Software might have errors that cause the service to fail and become unavailable. The EHR is a very central  solution to share patient information and is even legally regulated and requires security certification in most  countries, reducing the occurrence probability. The government infrastructure typically also supports relevant  governmental services that require a stable availability of the services. It can therefore be assumed, that the  probability of system failures, especially hardware is usually relatively low. However, statistics on system  failures or SLAs from the Cloud service provider can provide a more accurate source of data to feed into the  risk assessment study.  4.2 USE CASE 2 – REMOTE CARE  Remote care (as part of Telemedicine) supports remote patient-doctor consultation and has  been increasingly used in recent times due to the pandemic and its circumstances. During  COVID-19, remote care/consultation has been a safe way to provide expert care and advice  lowering infection risk. In some countries, remote care is an established approach to overcome  centralised healthcare infrastructure and large distances. In this use case, we consider a service  provider that offers a video call platform for communication between health professionals and its  patients, individually or in group sessions. The service also offers recording, analysis, and  transcription of the calls to assist the health professionals with medical evaluations, diagnosis,  and documentation.  CLOUD SECURITY FOR HEALTHCARE SERVICES  January 2021  24  Figure 2: Cloud Architecture Model – Remote Care  OVERVIEW  Service Model SaaS Deployment model Public Cloud  Healthcare organisation  The healthcare organisation uses a telemedicine (including audio and video) application for its  doctor-patient consultation. The communication service is offered as a web and mobile  application. The healthcare professionals connect over the internet using a client to access the  Cloud service. Patients connect over the internet using either their computer or mobile phone.  Cloud service provider  The Cloud service provider is a communication technology company offering a SaaS  communication service. Its responsibility includes application development, maintenance, and  providing the underlying infrastructure.  DEFINITION OF PROCESSING OPERATION AND ITS CONTEXT  Personal data processed  Contact Information (last and first name, nickname), video recordings, transcriptions of  recordings  Processing Purpose Provision of healthcare services (patient-doctor consultation)  Data Subject Patients/Medical professionals  Recipients of the Data Medical professionals  Data Processor SaaS Cloud service provider  CLOUD SECURITY FOR HEALTHCARE SERVICES  January 2021  25  ASSESSING CYBERSECURITY RISK IMPACT  When conducting a risk assessment for similar use cases, healthcare organisations should take  into account the possible impact of a cybersecurity incident on confidentiality (e.g. data breach  leading to exposed patient data), integrity (e.g. alteration of important patient data) or availability  (e.g. timely access to patient data). This would allow the healthcare organisation to assign an  appropriate quantitative or qualitative value to the risk impact depending on the specific risk  assessment methodology used.  A brief description of factors to be considered for risk impact assessment is listed below:  Factor Description  Confidentiality  Within the scope of the specific processing operation, the impact from loss of confidentiality can be  considerable as the primary focus of such use cases involves the direct exchange of patient data. Data  subjects may therefore encounter significant adverse effects from unauthorised disclosure of their health  data.  Integrity  The impact of the loss of integrity will depend on the nature of the telemedicine/remote care application. For  non-critical consultation applications the impact may not be as significant, but depending on the context,  alteration of medical data could have high-impact consequences. Data subjects may encounter significant or  even irreversible consequences from unauthorised alteration of health data (signals and statistics), which  could even make it difficult for them to receive appropriate treatment.  Availability  Assessing the impact of loss of availability heavily depends on the context of the telemedicine/remote care  application. This may range from low in the case of standard consultations for which alternative methods of  communication can be used to very high in the case of emergency interventions of medical staff using the  telemedicine platform.  ASSESSING RISK LIKELIHOOD  The table below describes how the main Cloud security threats may be relevant for the  reference Cloud architecture and the specific use case. Healthcare organisations should use  the information below when assessing the likelihood of a cybersecurity risk. It should however  be noted that the descriptions below only refer to the described use case and additional factors  related to the operational context of the healthcare organisation should be considered before  determining the risk likelihood. Similarly the underlying telecommunications infrastructure-  backbone would be a risk factor, however not in the scope of this assessment.  Threat Description  Natural  phenomena  Typically, in such use cases, the servers are located in data centres enforcing a suitable level of physical  security requirements, which tends to reduce the respective risk likelihood. Such data centres usually obtain  certificates that show that they are protected against fire, water, or earthquakes and the existence of such  certificates should be factored into the risk likelihood assessment.  Supply chain  failure  As the infrastructure is outsourced to Cloud providers the likelihood of this risk tends to be reduced. The  failure of power supply or other Cloud service disruptions is less likely because the providers are  specialised in maintaining their services. However, even big Cloud platforms are not entirely immune to  outages of their Cloud infrastructure.  Human error (Video)Conferencing tools are considered standard IT equipment which makes it more likely that users are  familiar with this technology and the relevant interfaces. Especially during the pandemic situation, the  adoption of and familiarisation with videoconferencing solutions has increased significantly. Still, the risk  may be higher when medical staff are less familiar with or un-trained in the use of such tools.  Malicious  actions  During the pandemic, many stakeholders have switched to remote conferencing and telemedicine, which in  turn has led to such solutions becoming more attractive targets. Healthcare organisations also extended the  use of teleconsultation. Potential attacks in this area might involve social engineering (e.g. phishing), theft,  espionage, malware (e.g. ransomware), or denial of service attacks.  System  failures  Videoconferencing technology has been developed and improved for a long time, resulting in well- established software solutions. Nevertheless, software failure might still happen with low likelihood since  Cloud has enough redundancy.  CLOUD SECURITY FOR HEALTHCARE SERVICES  January 2021  26  4.3 USE CASE 3 – MEDICAL DEVICES  Medical device data is made available to different stakeholders using Cloud technology to  enable remote patient monitoring e.g. for heart disease or diabetes patients. Medical device  manufacturers also provide medical device monitoring using Cloud computing technology.  In this use case, we consider a medical device manufacturer that produces a device to measure  certain patient data (e.g. a pacemaker measuring heartbeat). The device itself is not able to  communicate over the internet. However, it can transfer measurements via Bluetooth to  smartphones with an appropriate app from the device manufacturer. The app can then transfer  the aggregated measurements for a month to a Cloud file storage provider and share this  information with the treating doctor.  Figure 3: Cloud Architecture Model - Medical Device  OVERVIEW  Service Model PaaS Deployment model Private Cloud  Healthcare organisation  The healthcare organisation offers its patients a medical device (e.g. pacemaker) that is  connected to their mobile device. Healthcare professionals can access the measured data over  the internet using their clients.  Medical device manufacturer  The medical device manufacturer offers a Cloud service for patient measurements (e.g.  measuring heartbeats) to healthcare organisations. The medical device manufacturer provides  the application and the device and ensures the connection to the Cloud service provider through  APIs for data transfer. It uses PaaS to securely develop and deploy the software, including  sending emails with individualised links containing the uploaded aggregated measurements.  Cloud service provider  The Cloud service provider provides the application platform, including application interfaces  and the underlying Cloud infrastructure that includes network, servers, operating systems, and  storage.  CLOUD SECURITY FOR HEALTHCARE SERVICES  January 2021  27  DEFINITION OF PROCESSING OPERATION AND ITS CONTEXT  Personal data processed Contact information (last and first name), health data (e.g. heartbeat) measurements  Processing Purpose Provision of healthcare services (e.g. sharing heartbeat measurements)  Data Subject Patients  Recipients of the Data Medical professionals  Data Processor  PaaS Cloud service provider  ASSESSING CYBERSECURITY RISK IMPACT  When conducting a risk assessment for similar use cases, healthcare organisations should take  into account the possible impact of a cybersecurity incident on confidentiality (e.g. data breach  leading to exposed patient data), integrity (e.g. alteration of important patient data) or availability  (e.g. timely access to patient data). This would allow the healthcare organisation to assign an  appropriate quantitative or qualitative value to the risk impact depending on the specific risk  assessment methodology used. While this specific use case only involves collection of patient  data that is then subject to examination by medical staff, other use cases involving medical  devices may include the device itself taking actions based on measurements, resulting in a  drastically different risk profile. A brief description of factors to be considered for risk impact  assessment is listed below:  Factor Description  Confidentiality  Loss of confidentiality for similar use cases may cause data subjects to encounter significant adverse effects  from unauthorised disclosure of their health data. Within the scope of the specific processing operation, the  impact from loss of confidentiality is not necessarily considered critical since the disclosure of  measurements such as heartbeats is usually not as severe as disclosing other health data. However if the  data is exchanged in its entirety through unsecure means (i.e. email) poses a risk in itself. In a broader  context, the impact of loss of confidentiality for use cases involving medical devices depends on the nature  of the data involved in the operation.  Integrity  In the case of loss of integrity, data subjects may encounter significant or even irreversible consequences  from unauthorized alteration of health data. For instance, doctors may prescribe inappropriate medication.  This impact is heavily influenced by the overall treatment process; for instance, a doctor might notice  sudden deviations from regular measurements and doctors usually explain treatment procedures or  changes in medication via personal conversations, which might reveal the alteration of data. In the case of  more automated processes or even processes where the device can even act based on the data, the impact  of loss of integrity may be significantly higher.  Availability  The impact of loss of availability may range from moderate to critical depending on the frequency by which  the measurements need to be made available to medical staff or even the nature of the measurements (e.g.  when an anomaly in measurements may indicate a life threatening circumstance). The lack of data may  affect the patient’s health because unavailability affects intervention options.  ASSESSING RISK LIKELIHOOD  The table below describes how the main cloud security threats may be relevant for the  reference cloud architecture and the specific use case. Healthcare organisations should use the  information below when assessing the likelihood of a cybersecurity risk. It should however be  noted that the descriptions below only refer to the described use case and additional factors  related to the operational context of the healthcare organisation should be considered before  determining the risk likelihood.

Such data centres usually obtain  certificates that show that they are protected against fire, water, or earthquakes and the existence of such  certificates should be factored into the risk likelihood assessment.  Supply chain  failure  As the infrastructure is outsourced to Cloud providers, the likelihood of this risk rends to be reduced. The  failure of power supply or other Cloud service disruptions is less likely because the providers are specialised  in maintaining their services. However, even big Cloud platforms are not entirely immune to outages of their  Cloud infrastructure.  Human error The medical devices need to be configured and require patches. The lack of patches or adequate  configuration, procedures, or processing errors may leave the device vulnerable to cyberattacks.  Malicious  actions  The system handles patients' private information, which might be interesting for malicious actors. Malicious  attackers may also be internal actors who might have direct or indirect access to the Cloud services. Potential  attacks in this area might involve theft, espionage, malware (e.g., ransomware), or denial of service attacks.  On the other hand, Cloud service providers can have access to the knowledge of internal and external  security experts, which allows them to enforce security measures more efficiently than proprietary data  centres. These factors and especially the operational context of the healthcare organisation and the Cloud  service provider should be assessed when determining the risk likelihood.  System  failures  Medical devices undergo an extensive certification process that should impact occurrence probability  positively. The software to access the health data may be subjected to failures, but security requirements are  relatively high to ensure patient safety. Network and IT hardware failure may occur and depends heavily on  the location. However, there is very low probability for system failures due to the multi tenancy and  redundancy the Cloud services offer.  CLOUD SECURITY FOR HEALTHCARE SERVICES  January 2021  29  5. CLOUD SECURITY  MEASURES  This section provides a set of guidelines for ensuring cybersecurity and data protection for the  healthcare sector’s Cloud customers procuring and eventually providing Cloud-based  healthcare services. The security measures are based on common frameworks for Cloud  security such as BSI C5 and ANSSI Cloud recommendations, but also the ongoing work on  Cloud certification. This section contains the security measures with corresponding references  to the good practices of ENISA’s procurement guide and the use cases.  5.1 CLOUD SECURITY MEASURES AND GOOD PRACTICES  In general, the Cloud security measures, and the corresponding responsibility depend heavily  on the chosen service and deployment model.  Each Cloud security measure entails:   a reference to the good practices of the Procurement Guide (ENISA, 2020),   a reference to the use case, for which the measure is applicable,   an indication of the responsibility per use case and   additional data protection considerations.  The last item relates to how each security measure eventually satisfies a potential data  protection requirement and shows how through this measure acceptable implementation of the  requirement is met. Some use cases require stronger data protection measures due to the  criticality of the data and the evaluated risk. These enhancement considerations are attached to  the Cloud security measures where applicable.  SM-01 Identify security and data protection requirements  Involve necessary stakeholders such as risk, legal, compliance, or IT department in the procurement process. Requirements  solicitation should entail regulatory compliance.  Investigate and identify requirements such as:   local legislation and pan-area legislation for cloud security, cybersecurity and data protection   internal requirements such as information security policies   legal requirements which apply to a specific healthcare product, for instance, countries enforce specific security and  data protection requirements for electronic health records.   security and data protection requirements of the governmental Cloud service provider.  Check and assess legal requirements for data protection, cybersecurity, and Cloud security. Reconcile legal requirements with  the security controls of the Cloud service provider. In this case, it would be essential for the health care organisation to tag and  assign data based on sensitivity levels, and ensuring that is provided to the CSPs so they can assign higher or lower levels of  controls depending on the data.  Request evidence from the Cloud provider such as certification from third-party auditors to ensure the Cloud provider's adherence  to recognised standards.  Ensure that responsibilities for ensuring compliance between the Cloud customer and Cloud service provider are identified and  understood.  Address security and privacy requirements in the service level agreement between the Cloud customer and the Cloud service  provider. Require proof from the CSP for ensuring compliance with the requirements.  Reference to Good Practice Procurement GP 1.

CONCLUSION  For a number of years healthcare organisations have been contemplating moving part of their  ICT infrastructure and services to the Cloud. Over this period, a number of healthcare-specific  solutions have been developed using a variety of service models and deployment models fit for  purpose. The on-going pandemic has further highlighted the importance of certain healthcare  services that could benefit significantly from a move to the Cloud. The potential improvements in  availability, scalability and reliability of services such as telemedicine, wider deployment and use  of EHR and medical devices for remote patient care come on top of the cybersecurity, economic  and efficiency benefits Cloud services can bring to healthcare organisations.  Yet, the level of adoption of Cloud services in healthcare remains low and generally limited to  administrative processes. A number of factors contribute to this, including lack of trust in Cloud  services, lack of expertise, compliance requirements, particularly in relation to data protection,  and more.  This report aims to help healthcare organisations in taking the next step towards further  adoption of Cloud services. Built around three standard use cases of Cloud services in a  healthcare context, this report highlights the main factors to be considered from a cybersecurity  and data protection standpoint when assessing the relevant risks. The factors can be used in  any risk assessment methodology that the healthcare organisations are currently using.  Moreover, the report proposes a set of security measures for healthcare organisations to  implement when planning their move to Cloud services. These measures cover both  cybersecurity and data protection aspects and are linked to the procurement guidelines for  healthcare organisations previously published by ENISA.  While this report is a step towards supporting healthcare organisations in taking the next step  towards Cloud services it is not enough on its own. Healthcare organisations would require  additional support, such as specific guidance from national and EU authorities, industry  standards on Cloud security, especially in a healthcare context, clear guidelines from Data  Protection Authorities on moving healthcare data to the Cloud and collaboration with Cloud  service providers and medical device manufacturers to develop suitable Cloud solutions.

The integration of new technology in an already complex IT  infrastructure opens up new challenges regarding data protection and cybersecurity. Moreover,  the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has been a further catalyst for cyberattacks on healthcare  organisations1,2,3. Typical examples are phishing attacks that aim to collect user credentials of  healthcare professionals and ransomware4 against hospitals and other Healthcare  Organisations (HCO).  At the same time this pandemic stresses the need for remote healthcare services, since the  system was overwhelmed in some countries and physical presence was a risk for the spread of  the pandemic. In this context, Cloud solutions have provided elasticity and fast access for the  deployment of new services including «virtual» health and telemedicine.  This study aims to provide Cloud security practices for the healthcare sector and identify  security aspects, including relevant data protection aspects, to be taken into account  when procuring Cloud services for the healthcare industry.  The set of general practices aims to help IT professionals in the healthcare security contexts to  establish and maintain Cloud security while selecting and deploying appropriate technical and  organisational measures. The identification of relevant threats and risks to Cloud services in the  healthcare industry and security and data protection requirements are also covered by the  scope of this report. Further objectives include the presentation of informative and practice-  oriented use cases and their analysis of relevant threats and Cloud security measures.  The overall conclusion derived from the study, is that Cloud integration in the healthcare sector  in the EU is still in its infancy. Some healthcare organisations hesitate to adopt Cloud services,  because they are challenged by a dense and complex legal basis, and new technologies.  Furthermore, the loss of data governance and processing of personal data in the Cloud makes  healthcare organisations hesitant to adopt Cloud services. Other healthcare organisations use  PaaS for connecting medical devices with a web-application for remote monitoring of patients or  SaaS for documentation and scheduling doctor-patient consultations. Some countries are in the  beginning of forming a Government Cloud (G-Cloud) to satisfy such needs. There are also  various government managed services such as electronic prescription and electronic health  records, which run on government-owned resources, such as private Clouds and state owned  datacentres and Clouds.  The study is structured around three use cases, which are the most prominent in using Cloud or  to be using in the future, namely Electronic Health Record, Remote Care and Medical Devices.  A set of 17 security and data protection measures has been identified to be relevant for  ensuring Cloud security and have been assessed based on the use case.  1 https://www.verdict.co.uk/healthcare/  2 https://healthitsecurity.com/news/covid-19-impact-on-ransomware-threats-healthcare-cybersecurity  3 https://healthitsecurity.com/news/the-10-biggest-healthcare-data-breaches-of-2020-so-far  4 https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/alerts/aa20-302a  https://www.verdict.co.uk/healthcare/ https://healthitsecurity.com/news/covid-19-impact-on-ransomware-threats-healthcare-cybersecurity https://healthitsecurity.com/news/the-10-biggest-healthcare-data-breaches-of-2020-so-far https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/alerts/aa20-302a  CLOUD SECURITY FOR HEALTHCARE SERVICES  January 2021  8  1. INTRODUCTION  1.1 CONTEXT OF THE REPORT  The healthcare sector is one of the sectors most vulnerable to cyber attacks5. Simultaneously,  the digitalisation of the healthcare sector is moving forward, and digital solutions or electronic  records continuously replace paper-based processes. The transformation affects services along  the complete healthcare delivery chain, i.e. medication, appointment scheduling, patient  records, inpatient and outpatient care as well as inpatient and remote monitoring or self-  management.  Digitalisation offers new solutions to improve patient care and gain operational excellence in  healthcare organisations. Cloud solutions for healthcare services offer an excellent opportunity  to increase operational efficiency, cut costs on IT expenditure and improve cybersecurity and  data protection. This is since Cloud service providers have resources such as personnel,  knowledge of technology, and the financial means to improve cybersecurity and data protection  continuously. These are the same factors that sometimes have proven to hinder advances in  the maturity of data protection and cybersecurity at healthcare organisations.  The COVID-19 pandemic has pushed Cloud-based technology usage in the healthcare sector,  especially in telemedicine, for patient-doctor consultations and artificial intelligence for triaging  purposes. The further integration of Cloud computing services in the healthcare sector also  raises security and data protection concerns. This report therefore aims to help ensure Cloud  security for healthcare.  1.2 OBJECTIVE  This report's overall objective is to provide the target audience with a set of guidelines to ensure  cybersecurity and security of personal data processing when procuring Cloud services for  providing healthcare services and a clear understanding of the corresponding responsibilities.  The goals are to provide an overview of the landscape of the applicable EU legislative  instruments relevant to Cloud services in the healthcare sector and the main cybersecurity and  data protection challenges, relevant to security of personal data processing, of Cloud customers  from the healthcare sector.  1.3 SCOPE  The study's scope is Cloud services that support the broader eHealth ecosystem, such as  healthcare services and facilities, medical devices and equipment, medical services, or  managed care. It is not limited to a specific Cloud architecture, neither deployment nor service  model. The study focuses on showing relevant threats, measures, and responsibility by  analysing three representative use cases, electronic health record, remote care, and medical  devices.  The set of guidelines for Cloud security of healthcare services (output) is primarily for Cloud  customers, such as healthcare organisations or medical device manufacturers. The study,  investigation, and the output are centred on the European Union and European Free Trade  Association (EFTA) member states.  5 IBM, X-Force Threat Intelligence Index, 2020, pp. 39., see also Moore, J., Which sectors are most vulnerable to cyber  attacks, 2020. https://www.ifsecglobal.com/cyber-security/which-sectors-are-most-vulnerable-to-cyber attacks/  COVID-19  pandemic  indicated how  vulnerable the  healthcare  sector is to  cyberattacks  and the need for  “tele” medicine  also as a more  secure solution.  https://www.ifsecglobal.com/cyber-security/which-sectors-are-most-vulnerable-to-cyber%20attacks/  CLOUD SECURITY FOR HEALTHCARE SERVICES  January 2021  9  1.4 TARGET AUDIENCE  The target audience of the study’s output acceptable practices for ensuring Cloud security for  healthcare services is anyone interested in using Cloud technology in the healthcare sector.  The main focus is on Cloud customers in healthcare, primarily:   IT health professionals (CISO, CIO, IT procurement specialists, and IT-teams in charge  of purchasing Cloud services)   Healthcare professionals in managerial positions seeking advice on whether to procure  Cloud services  The report may be useful to IT professionals from medical device manufacturers and possibly,  policymakers and Cloud service providers.  1.5 METHODOLOGY  The applied methodology of this study comprises four steps.   Step 1 Desk Research: Extensive desk research for gathering information identifying  Cloud services supporting healthcare services, Cloud security threats, and security  controls for providing Cloud security for healthcare in general and during the  procuring process.   Step 2 Questionnaire and semi-structured interviews: Experts and  representatives from the healthcare and Cloud technology industry of ENISA’s expert  network have provided information on Cloud-based healthcare services, its  associated risks and opportunities, Cloud security and cybersecurity requirements in  general, and implemented or identified cybersecurity and data protection measures  from their point of view. Interviews have been conducted to collect additional valuable  input from the experts.   Step 3 Analysis: The analysis of the results from step 1 and step 2 provides input for  the report and its objectives. This step supports the identification of security  challenges and the validation of the use cases. Based on the analysis results, the first  draft of the report has been drafted.   Step 4 Review and validation: The last step comprises the review and validation by  ENISA’s expert group. The final version of the report is drafted, taking into account  the feedback from the experts.  1.6 STRUCTURE OF THE DOCUMENT  The report is structured as follows:   Section 1 – Introduction provides introductory information on the report and  describes the scope, objectives, target audience, and the applied methodology.   Section 2 – Cloud Services in Healthcare outlines Cloud service terminology,  characteristics, and responsibilities. It includes an overview of Cloud services in  healthcare identified through desk research and interviews.   Section 3 – Cybersecurity considerations in Cloud for Healthcare entails  cybersecurity and data protection considerations for the use of Cloud for healthcare  services. It also includes a threat taxonomy based on the ENISA procurement guide.   Section 4 – Use cases shows a description of the possible use cases, the factors to  be considered when conducting the respective risk analyses in terms of risk likelihood  and impact, and appropriate security measures, relevant to personal data processing,  for risk mitigation.   Section 5 – Cloud security measures in healthcare lists and presents measures  for ensuring Cloud security for healthcare services, including additional data  protection considerations.  CLOUD SECURITY FOR HEALTHCARE SERVICES  January 2021  10  2. HEALTHCARE IN THE  CLOUD  2.1 POLICY CONTEXT  Legislation plays an important role in defining cybersecurity requirements and adopting  cybersecurity and data protection related measures. In the case of healthcare and the Cloud,  the policy landscape at national or European level is still at early stages of development. Very  few MS have Cloud-related guidelines specifically for the healthcare sector, simply because if  Cloud security guidance is in place, it applies to all critical sectors; all Member States consider  healthcare a critical sector.  The general conclusion derived from the desk research and expert interviews shows that MS  have a dedicated legislation for healthcare activities (not necessarily covering cybersecurity)  and in several cases they adopt cybersecurity guidelines for Cloud computing; there is no case  of healthcare and Cloud specific legislation. This corresponds to the assessment of the  healthcare sector as critical, thus required to abide by overall cybersecurity legislations and  guidelines.  At the same time, identification of requirements deriving from national or European legislation,  proves crucial when procuring Cloud services. Some healthcare services, electronic health  records for instance, have a separate law entailing security and data protection requirements.  And eventually, to some extent the general practices overlap.  The illustration below depicts the legislative situation regarding Cloud security and healthcare.  From a legal requirements perspective, we examined four topic-related dimensions: privacy,  cybersecurity, Cloud security, and healthcare.  Figure 1: Legislations related to Cloud security and healthcare  CLOUD SECURITY FOR HEALTHCARE SERVICES  January 2021  11  The most relevant legal documents or guidelines at EU level are summarised below.  2.1.1 The Network and Information Security Directive (NISD)  The Network and Information Security Directive (NISD) 2016/1148/EU6, which came into force in  May 2018, has two main goals: the implementation of minimum security requirements and the  establishment of cybersecurity notifications for both Operators of Essential Services and Digital  Service Providers. Healthcare providers, namely hospitals, are identified as Operators of  Essential Services in most Member States. At the same time Cloud Service Providers are  considered Digital Service Providers. Therefore, both these types of organisations will have to  take the Directive and the relevant national law into account when contracting a Cloud service.  The Directive goes beyond implementation of security requirements, as it gives power to the  regulatory bodies to audit the Operators of Essential Services to ensure the level of  cybersecurity in the organisation is acceptable and as per the provisions of the Directive. At the  same time, the Directive puts in scope specific services which span among the designated  essential sectors. In the healthcare ecosystem, this can be translated as cybersecurity  requirements for all products so it should be included as a provision in the procurement  process.  For the Digital Service Providers, the decision on the details of cybersecurity measures resides  with the MS, since the Directive leaves a certain level of flexibility. In the case of Cloud services  offered to an operator of essential healthcare service, both parties need to agree on how the  legal requirements will be met before reaching a contractual agreement.  2.1.2 General Data Protection Regulation  The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)7 came into force on 25 May 2018. It sets the  rules for the processing and free movement of personal data and applies to all domains of the  public and private sector; however, some specific derogations are defined for data concerning  health, aimed at protecting the rights of data subjects and confidentiality of their personal health  data and at the same time preserving the benefits of data processing for research and public  health purposes.  The GDPR considers health data as a \"special category\" of personal data which are considered  to be sensitive by nature and imposes a higher standard of protection for their processing.  Organisations (Data controllers) processing health data have the following obligations (among  others):   to implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure security of  the processing systems, services and personal data,   to perform data protection impact assessment, and   to report data breaches which are likely to result in a risk to the rights and freedoms of  individuals within 72 hours after having become aware of them.  The GDPR expanded the scope of application of EU data protection law requirements to the  data processors as well. This means that Cloud service providers, acting as data processors on  behalf of the data controller, have obligations as data controllers but their obligations would not  necessarily be the same.  2.1.3 Non regulatory guidelines  Prior to the adoption of GDPR, in 2012, the European Data Protection Supervisor (EDPS) had  issued an opinion on the use of Cloud Computing and provided guidance indicating security  measures for data protection but also sharing considerations in respect to responsibilities  6 https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/dir/2016/1148/oj  7 https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2016/679/oj  https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/dir/2016/1148/oj https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2016/679/oj  CLOUD SECURITY FOR HEALTHCARE SERVICES  January 2021  12  between data processor and data controller. This can be used as a basis for Cloud security  requirements solicitation from the healthcare sectors as well.  In 2015, the Joint Action to Support the eHealth Network (JASEHN) issued a report8 on the use  of Cloud computing in health focusing primarily on the secondary use of health data where  amongst other explains the responsibility shift between the HCO and the CSP based on the  service model (IaaS, PaaS, SaaS etc).  In 2018, the European Data Protection Board (EDPB) and the EDPS issued an opinion9  specifically for healthcare namely on data protection for eHealth Digital Service Infrastructure  compiled under the directive on patients’ rights to cross-border healthcare. Amongst other  things, the opinion includes requirements for more secure information exchange (i.e.  encryption), secure data storage and that the EC, as data processor, has to clarify the  governing rules of the processing.  2.2 CLOUD COMPUTING BASICS  2.2.1 Cloud Services  As per previous ENISA publications10, the basic types of Cloud services can be explained in the  following diagram:  Figure 2: Basic types of Cloud services  Interpreting the diagram from left to right:   Infrastructure as a Service: In IaaS, the provider delivers computing resources (virtual  hardware), accessible online. The software providing access to the resources is called  the hypervisor. Generally speaking there are two types of resources: processing power  8 https://webgate.ec.europa.eu/chafea_pdb/health/projects/677102/outputs  9 https://edps.europa.eu/data-protection/our-work/publications/opinions/edpb-edps-joint-opinion-ehdsi_en  10 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/cloud-and-big-data  https://webgate.ec.europa.eu/chafea_pdb/health/projects/677102/outputs https://edps.europa.eu/data-protection/our-work/publications/opinions/edpb-edps-joint-opinion-ehdsi_en https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/cloud-and-big-data  CLOUD SECURITY FOR HEALTHCARE SERVICES  January 2021  13  (including network resources), and (block) storage (memory resources). Examples  include Amazon’s Elastic Compute Cloud, Google’s Compute Engine, Amazon Simple  Storage Service, Dropbox, Rackspace, etc. Note that object storage services (e.g.  Dropbox) are often considered SaaS.   Platform as a Service: In PaaS, the provider delivers a platform, or more precisely,  application servers, for customers to run applications on. PaaS providers sometimes  provide a software development tool for the platform. Examples of applications running  on these platforms are scripts (PHP, Python, e.g.) or byte code (Java servlets, C#).  Examples include Google App engine, Microsoft Azure, Amazon Elastic Beanstalk, etc.   Software as a Service: In SaaS, the provider delivers full-fledged software or  applications, via the internet. Applications range from email servers, document editors,  customer relationship management systems, and so on. SaaS services can often be  accessed with a browser or a web services client. Note that it is not uncommon for  SaaS providers to run their applications on an IaaS or PaaS from another provider. An  example is the video streaming site Netflix (SaaS) which runs on Amazon AWS  computing services (PaaS/IaaS).   Facilities denote the physical structures and supplies such as networks, cooling,  power, etc.   Organisation denotes the human resources, the policies and procedures for  maintaining the facilities and supporting the delivery of the services.  2.2.2 Cloud Deployment models  Private Cloud is a model in which one customer has exclusive access to the Cloud  infrastructure and computational resources, that can be hosted by the customer itself or a  provider, over a private network.  Public Cloud refers to a shared Cloud infrastructure and computational resources that are  available and reachable over the public internet.  Hybrid Cloud is a model for a group of users that share the same Cloud infrastructure and the  computational resource. The premises may be owned, managed, and operated by one or more  of the organisations in the community, a third party, or both. It may exist on the community’s  location (on-site) or the third-party’s location (off-site).  Governmental Cloud (g-Cloud) is a Cloud environment where the Cloud infrastructure is  owned, governed and run by the government or a state-owned entity using own resources or a  selected third-party provider. In addition, the governmental Cloud enables the public body to  provide services to public sector stakeholders, to citizens and enterprises.  For the purpose of this report, the definition of governmental Cloud is presented based on  ENISA’s reports11.  2.2.3 Division of responsibilities  Similarly depending on the service model selected, the responsibilities might lie either on the  side of the customer or of the provider; the higher you move in the service stack as a customer  the fewer technical responsibilities one has to implement. Note that this diagram is for  illustration only and does not provide an exhaustive list of security processes on the provider’s  or the customer’s side. In specific settings there may be specific agreements about the  11 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/cloud-and-big-data/cloud-security  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/cloud-and-big-data/cloud-security  CLOUD SECURITY FOR HEALTHCARE SERVICES  January 2021  14  outsourcing of security tasks. An IaaS provider, for example, might have a service for patching  the Operating System (OS) of customers. Sometimes such services are offered by a third-party  (and this is also known as Security-As-A-Service or SECaaS).  At this point, it needs to be stressed that cybersecurity is always a shared responsibility- so  regardless of the service model acquired, the customer always has a role in the cybersecurity or  privacy requirements adoption.  Figure 3: Division of responsibilities of Cloud services  From the data protection perspective, the definitions and most likely assignment of roles are as  follows:   Data controller: “the natural or legal person, public authority, agency or other body  which, alone or jointly with others, determines the purposes and means of the  processing of personal data” GDPR Art. 4(7).   Data processor: “a natural or legal person, public authority, agency or other body  which processes personal data on behalf of the controller” GDPR Art. 4 (7).  Depending on the service model (IaaS/PaaS/SaaS), the data processor might be the  CSP or the customer. The higher a healthcare organisation moves up the Cloud  services stack, the more processing power the Cloud provider has.  2.3 TYPES OF CLOUD SERVICES IN HEALTHCARE  In the healthcare sector, Cloud solutions exist for different healthcare services and their number  is increasing. In this chapter, we provide a non-exhaustive overview of the currently identified  Cloud solutions for healthcare systems. These solutions may come in different cloud service  types (e.g. SaaS, PaaS etc.) or cloud deployment models. The following descriptions focus  primarily on the types of functions and services supported by existing cloud services as  opposed to the deployment models and relevant architectures.  CLOUD SECURITY FOR HEALTHCARE SERVICES  January 2021  15  Table 1: Non-exhaustive overview of the currently identified Cloud solutions for healthcare systems  Type of cloud services  Description  Enterprise resource  planning systems  (ERP systems)  Enterprise resources planning systems support the management of patients, appointments, medical  staff’s schedules and inventory. Dedicated parts of an ERP system could be available as Cloud- based solutions, for instance:   Patient management system   Health insurance management   Billing and human resource management   Other non-clinical data management  Health information  systems (HIS)  Health information systems are used for managing healthcare data and entail demographic and  medical patient data, which comprise records, images, or even videos. In the area of health  information systems, the following types are available or used as a Cloud-based solution:   Electronic health record (EHR)   Picture archiving and communication system (PACS)   Electronic prescription information system   Radiology information system (RIS)   Laboratory information system (LIS)   Clinical decision support (CDS)   Remote patient monitoring (RPM)  Communication  services  Middleware is a communication service to transfer data between systems or devices with a different  physical location. For instance, in a Cloud-based solution for a remote monitoring solution, only the  transfer from the device to the electronic health record is Cloud-based with the medical data being  stored at a data storage facility in the healthcare organisation.  Office management  Healthcare organisations use Cloud-based file servers for document archiving or mail servers for  internal and external communication.  Cloud-based network  Cloud-based networks enable healthcare organisations to share infrastructure on an as-needed  basis; therefore, having more flexibility if more resources in particular situations are required.  Health data analytics  Health data analytics need a lot of computing power. Healthcare organisations outsource this task  with Cloud technologies.  Artificial intelligence12, machine learning is used to support medical research, diagnosis (e.g. cancer13  or cardiac pathology14), data analysis (e.g. glucose measurement), treatment recommendation, and  patient engagement. The use of Cloud computing technology for this area is continuously evaluated.  Medical devices  Medical devices identify data that can be accessed through a mobile app or a web-based platform  from different stakeholders. The healthcare services provided using Cloud-based medical devices are  blood pressure measurement using electronic stethoscope15, glucose measurement, and  electrocardiogram. The goal is to enable patients to measure heart rates or insulin level at home while  the data is directly available to healthcare professionals for treating or scheduling an appointment.  Diagnostic cameras that support healthcare professionals during the diagnosis also belong to this  category.  Telemedicine services  Telemedicine is a healthcare service provided using telecommunication technology. The areas of  application comprise of teleconsultation and tele assistance using conference or video-conference  tools.  Medication monitoring  Medication assistance16 supports patients following their medication through real-time monitoring. It is  a further remote healthcare technology application17 together with telemedicine and medical devices.  Supply chain  management  Supply Chain Management guarantees the timely availability of safe medical devices for use in the  healthcare processes. This includes equipment, implants, disposables and medical software.  12 Davenport and Kalakota, 2019  13 Junaid Ahmad, Vinai, Bilal, 2015 and Sadhasivam, Balamurugan, and Pandi, 2018  14 Agliari et al., 2020  15 Leng et al. 2015  16 Ventsislav and Rosen, 2016  17 Cavoukian et al., 2010  CLOUD SECURITY FOR HEALTHCARE SERVICES  January 2021  16  3. CYBERSECURITY  CONSIDERATIONS IN CLOUD  FOR HEALTHCARE  3.1 CLOUD SECURITY CHALLENGES FOR HEALTHCARE  In this section, we present the main challenges regarding Cloud security, derived from the input  of different experts collected through interviews. Even if the list is not exhaustive, the identified  challenges comprise trends and obstacles regarding cybersecurity and data protection of the  healthcare sector and the risks from Cloud-based healthcare services.   Lack of trust of Cloud solutions: Overall, it has become evident that stakeholders in  the healthcare sector (patients, physicians, medical staff, and healthcare organisation  management) indicated a lack of trust of Cloud solutions. For example, patients'  concern for their medical data being stored at the facilities Cloud service provider is  often reduced due to the pre-existing relationship of trust between patient and doctor  and due to the higher valuation of the patient’s health over data protection and  cybersecurity. In the case of medical staff, they tend to be less aware of cybersecurity  and data protection. Therefore, it is a challenge to raise awareness for security-related  topics and train in new authentication or identification technology. Also, human  resources do nοt need to necessarily understand security and technologies- however  they should be aware of the offerings of the Cloud providers in terms of that expertise.  Without training and education, the occurrence of human errors and social engineering  attacks is more likely.   Lack of security and technology expertise: Moving the entire IT infrastructure or  individual services from on site to the Cloud requires human resources that understand  Cloud technologies and the associated security and data protection aspects. These  knowledge requirements may not be covered by the same IT personnel responsible for  the on-site infrastructure and eventually result in job termination. To migrate back from  the Cloud to on-site infrastructure may be more challenging under such circumstances.  Furthermore, the demand for Cloud security experts for the healthcare sector is higher  than its supply, hindering Cloud computing advancement.   Cybersecurity investment is not a priority: A lack of healthcare organisation  management support or restricted public financing results in less financial support to  further promote the digitalisation and to increase cybersecurity and data protection  maturity in the healthcare sector.   Proving regulatory compliance of the CSP:  In several cases, Cloud customers  have difficulty identifying which Cloud service provider is compliant with their set of  legal requirements which sometimes limits their options for CSP collaboration.  Assessment by the cloud customer of the Cloud provider’s compliance is rarely  possible or only with considerable financial resources. However, many CSPs provide  this publicly via their compliance websites, and is often backed up from independent  3rd parties or even, sometimes, through government certification/assurance programs.  In the other hand, regulatory requirements are so complex when it comes to  healthcare-related data that CSPs do not even include these types of customers in  their business model.  CLOUD SECURITY FOR HEALTHCARE SERVICES  January 2021  17   Integration of Cloud with legacy systems difficulties: The integration of Cloud  solutions with already existing healthcare organisation infrastructure or connecting  several devices in-house and cross border, involves a great challenge and even results  in refraining from using Cloud services. Moreover, in most cases, legacy systems are a  part of health IT infrastructure. These systems are not supported by updates from their  suppliers, which complicates integration and interoperability with new technology.  Consequently, this makes these systems vulnerable to cybersecurity attacks. Hybrid  deployment models allow a mix of health IT systems to partner with CSP  services/solutions to deliver the most customizable needs to health care organisations.  At the same time, the cost of deploying extra security features or integrating security  elements with the on premise security perimeter is very high.  3.2 DATA PROTECTION CHALLENGES IN THE CLOUD  Similarly, in this section we present the main data protection-related challenges as derived from  interviews with experts focusing mostly on the technical requirements for Cloud services in  healthcare:   Privacy by design techniques: The healthcare provider needs to understand whether  the Cloud provider has followed a privacy-by-design approach (both policies and  measures) when developing and deploying the service. The GDPR introduces a legal  requirement on privacy by design and by default for both data controllers and data  processors. Some of the techniques mentioned are minimising the processing of  personal data, pseudonymising personal data as soon as possible, transparency with  regard to the functions and processing of personal data, enabling the data subject to  monitor the data processing and enabling the controller to create and improve security  features. Such approaches and strategies can be achieved through the use of  particular technologies and policies, such as authentication, attribute-based  credentials, secure private communications, anonymity and pseudonymity, statistical  disclosure control, privacy preserving computations, and others18.   Data management: Healthcare organisations as authorised parties (after receiving  consent) collect, structure and manage patient data. In some cases the information is  automatically transferred to the Cloud (i.e. from a medical device) or it is input by a  delegated party (i.e. medical practitioner). Depending on the type of service in the  Cloud, the input information might be created by a different actor making accuracy of  information a great issue. Controls for ensuring data accuracy should be in place, even  if performed by third parties. Organisations need to establish their own data  governance model/frameworks for understanding what kind of data is the most  sensitive and then applying the required level of controls. Another issue to consider is  interoperability, specifically for healthcare. This is a sector where Cloud computing  brings many benefits due to its flexible range of services.   Data deletion: It is extremely important to be able to erase data after retention time  has expired, but also upon data subject’s request without undue delay. The data  subjects can substantiate their requests with one of the grounds foreseen in GDPR,  such as when the data is no longer necessary for the initial purpose or when the data  subject withdraws consent. Cloud providers have partially addressed the issue of  identifying storage areas of chunks of information (data tagging). However, effective  deletion of data is still a technical challenge.   Data portability: This challenge goes hand in hand with vendor lock-in, the most  common risk regarding Cloud Computing. Data portability refers to the transfer of one’s  18 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/big-data-protection  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/big-data-protection  CLOUD SECURITY FOR HEALTHCARE SERVICES  January 2021  18  data from one provider to another without loss upon their request. For healthcare  certain standards are in place (like HL7) to ensure interoperability and thus portability.   Encryption: One of the most important and at the same time difficult measures to  implement is encryption. It is important to ensure secrecy and integrity but it has to be  applied in all the different channels of data transfer and storage. Encryption measures  need to be implemented at both client and server level but also in the channel that  connects them. Responsibility then resides in both the Cloud customer and the Cloud  provider and has huge implications from a technical and legal perspective. At the same  time, few CSPs share the encryption keys with their customer leaving full control to the  provider.  3.3 CYBERSECURITY THREATS  Following the threat taxonomy of ENISA’s procurement guide19 (ENISA, 2020), this section  shows how the specific cybersecurity in healthcare can have implications for Cloud services.  Table 2: Cybersecurity Threats in healthcare and implications for Cloud services  High-level threat Threat Description  Natural phenomena Fire, floods or earthquakes  Natural forces affect the Cloud infrastructure and eventually  could result in a destruction of relevant systems, network  components, or devices. Although the threat probability is low,  the impact might be huge.  Supply chain failure Cloud service provider failure  The Cloud services’ availability is highly dependent on the Cloud  service provider. Bankruptcy of the Cloud service provider, for  instance, may threaten the continuous availability of the Cloud  service, which may cause operational outages of healthcare  organisations due to service failure. In the case of the Cloud  provider’s failure, a lack of data export and portability may result  in loss of data. For all supply chain threats, redundancy and  resiliency are critical topics the healthcare organisations should  consider and inquire about.  Supply chain failure Network provider failure  Network connection is crucial to access Cloud services. A  network failure may impact Cloud-based healthcare service  provision and affect the collaboration between different internal  and external partners.  Supply chain failure Power supply failure  Power supply can affect the Cloud service's availability, which  may be critical when a pacemaker's data cannot be observed.  Human errors  Lack of tracing back  functionality  Logs of activities in the Cloud service enable accountability,  serve as evidence in the event of security incidents, and are used  to investigate the causes of security incidents. The Cloud  customer needs to ensure that logging is enabled based on risk.  It also provides transparency for patients in the case of electronic  health records.  Human errors  Unauthorised data access  (information leakage)  Cloud users may gain unauthorised access to data due to  insufficient access management or lack of awareness, which  causes unintentional data disclosure. For example, a Cloud- based electronic health record has more users than a  telemedicine solution.  Human errors Non-compliance  Nowadays, the bring-your-own-device policy is widely applied in  the healthcare sector, which causes variation in endpoint  security. Measures to secure endpoints need to be adopted, and  impacts on compliance, especially for accessing electronic health  records, should be analysed.  19 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/good-practices-for-the-security-of-healthcare-services  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/good-practices-for-the-security-of-healthcare-services  CLOUD SECURITY FOR HEALTHCARE SERVICES  January 2021  19  High-level threat Threat Description  Human errors Unintentional change of data  Entering incorrect data into a healthcare system can result in loss  of integrity and data disclosure to unauthorised users, such as  uploading medical documents to the wrong electronic health  record.  Human errors  Errors by Cloud service  administrators/support staff  If data is not appropriately deleted from a Cloud storage or the  backup media, the data may be accessed later by another Cloud  customer of the same Cloud provider, and eventually result in a  data breach. Configuration errors by Cloud service support staff  may also leave vulnerabilities unpatched and leave entry points  open for malicious attackers.  Malicious action  Malware injection attacks (i.e.  virus, ransomware, worms)  Cloud environments are susceptible to malware injection attacks,  which are a subcategory of web-based attacks. Attackers exploit  vulnerabilities of a web application and embed malicious code  into the normal action course. All Cloud service models are  equally vulnerable to this kind of malicious action. Once the  malicious code is executed, the attacker may eavesdrop,  manipulate or steal data and instigate further attacks.  Malicious action Hijacking  Hijacking infrastructure of the Cloud service provider to mine  cryptocurrency (crypto-jacking) or a medical device (med-jacking)  affects the patient’s safety or the performance of the Cloud  service healthcare provision. Hyper-jacking refers to hijacking the  hypervisor using a virtual machine-based rootkit. Successful  compromise of the hypervisor grants access to the entire  machine and allows the compromise of the virtual machine.  Malicious action  Social Engineering attacks i.e.  Phishing  Social engineering attacks to steal user credentials for SaaS  solutions through phishing, spam, or spear-phishing emails are  always targeted at the weakest link in the security chain, the  human. On the whole, the healthcare sector is commonly known  as less IT savvy and this raises the exposure to cyberattacks.  Strong authentication provided by the Cloud service provider  helps to prevent these kinds of attacks. Successful attacks could  result in data breaches, data leakage, or data theft.  Malicious action Account hijacking20  Account hijacking results from a malicious attacker gaining  access to privileged accounts or sensitive accounts, such as  Cloud service accounts or subscriptions. This threat can result in  severe disruption of Cloud services and the provision of  healthcare services.  Malicious action  Insecure interfaces and  application programming  interfaces  A Cloud computing environment provides user interfaces and  APIs to interconnect devices and interact with the Cloud service.  These interfaces offer an entry point for malicious attackers if  they are poorly designed and lack security measures such as  encryption and access control. Broken or hacked API’s may  result in data breaches.  Malicious action Insider threat  Insiders can be current or former employees of healthcare  organisations, contractors, or other trusted partners, who gain  access from the inside of an organisation. These parties have  had authorized access and may negatively affect the Cloud  service and ultimately result in a data breach.  Malicious action  Isolation failure (Multi- tenancy)  In shared environments, errors or attacks may provide one tenant  with access to another tenant's resources or data. A malicious  attacker may gain access to one specific Cloud customer's  resources or data or even all Cloud customers resulting in data  breaches.  20 Cloud Security Alliance, 2020  CLOUD SECURITY FOR HEALTHCARE SERVICES  January 2021  20  High-level threat Threat Description  Malicious action  Abuse of Cloud computational  resources  Common examples of Cloud computing resource misuse are  launching denial of service attacks, mining cryptocurrency,  starting to propagate phishing or spam emails, and hosting  malicious content in the Cloud environment. The abuse may  affect Cloud services’ availability or performance harming a  patient’s health.  Malicious action Denial of service  Denial of service attacks against the Cloud service overload its  resources due to a flood of requests originating from many  sources and cause its unavailability and inability to process  requests.  Malicious action  Intercepting data in transit  (Man-in-the middle attack)  In a Cloud architecture model, data is transferred from the Cloud  customer to the Cloud service provider. During transition, it may  be intercepted and eventually result in a data breach.  Malicious action Mobile application attacks21  Vulnerability in mobile apps running in the Cloud may also leave  entry points open to be exploited by malicious attackers and  result in data disclosure to unauthorised persons or even data  loss.  System Failure  Network-related technical  failures or attacks  Technical failures of network-related components influence the  availability of Cloud service. Examples include the loss of Internet  connectivity due to failures at the Cloud customer’s or service  provider’s site, a temporary reduction of network bandwidth at the  Cloud customer’s internet service provider, which affects the data  transfer from and to the Cloud service provider, and disruptions  in the global Internet routing infrastructure capping the  connection between the Cloud customer and Cloud service  provider.  System Failure  Insufficient maintenance and  maintenance procedures  Insufficient patch or life cycle management may occur at the  Cloud customer's and the Cloud provider's sites. Failing to  maintain the Cloud infrastructure and leaving software unpatched  may result in disturbances or even failure of the Cloud service.  Eventually, the patient's health may be affected due to  unavailable medical records.  System Failure Software failure  Due to errors, software failure can affect the Cloud services or  medical device data availability and eventually endanger patient  safety.  System Failure Hardware failure  Failure of IT hardware at the Cloud service provider's or  customer's site, limiting the Cloud service's availability, may  severely impact patients' health in emergency cases.  A medical device failure affects real-time data availability in the  Cloud service possibly harming the patient's health.  System Failure  Deployment/ configuration  Error  Technical failure related to system misconfiguration or  interoperability issues in deployment. A cloud migration is a data  centre migration, and it brings along all of the complexities that  traditionally go along with one.  21 OWASP, 2016  CLOUD SECURITY FOR HEALTHCARE SERVICES  January 2021  21  4. USE CASES  In this section, three use cases of Cloud services for healthcare are shown, including a  reference Cloud architecture, factors to be considered during risk assessment, and risk  mitigation measures.  4.1 USE CASE 1 - ELECTRONIC HEALTH RECORD  An electronic health record (EHR) provides services to a wide range of potential users: patients,  doctors, nurses, public health officials, and more. These systems collect, store, manage and  transmit sensitive health data such as patients’ contact details, social insurance numbers,  medical examinations’ results, pathologies, allergies, diagnosis, and treatment plan. Healthcare  professionals are provided with an overview of the history and the status of the patients’ health  and can access it if needed from pre-defined terminals within the healthcare provider’s  premises. After each examination or consultation, patient records are updated with the latest  data by the treating doctor or nurse either by scanning paper-based documents or manually  diagnosing and treatment plans.  Paper-based documents containing patient data are increasingly replaced with EHR in many  countries, allowing health information to be shared in an easy-to-use and standardised way  between different stakeholders such as healthcare professionals and patients. Solutions in this  area often involve the use of Cloud computing resources or partially Cloud-based components.  Patients can access and manage their EHR through a patient portal, which is usually integrated  into Cloud solutions22.  Figure 1: Cloud Architecture Model - Electronic Health Record (EHR)  22 This is an exemplar case as not every EHR deployment uses governmental Clouds provided by the respective ministry. It  is very common to see regional EHR deployments operated on public or private Clouds by public or private EHR providers.  An EHR is typically sourced as SaaS and not at IaaS level but for the sake of completeness in this report, the specific  service model is selected for the EHR.  CLOUD SECURITY FOR HEALTHCARE SERVICES  January 2021  22  OVERVIEW  Service Model IaaS Deployment model Governmental Cloud  Healthcare organisation network  The healthcare organisation network is the Cloud customer of  the governmental IaaS Cloud service provider. It is the body  responsible for developing, maintaining, and deploying the  application for sharing electronic patient records. Healthcare  organisations upload the patient EHRs either through the web  application or through an API, connecting their clinical  information system with the corresponding national data centre  in the Cloud. EHRs are stored at the national datacentre.  Patients access their health records through the web  application.  Cloud service provider  The ministry of health, a government institution, provides the  physical infrastructure for storing the EHRs. That includes,  amongst others, the maintenance of the network infrastructure  and the underlying operating systems.  DEFINITION OF PROCESSING OPERATION AND ITS CONTEXT  Personal data processed  Contact information (patient’s last and first name, address, telephone number, email address),  contact information of relatives for emergency cases, social insurance number, medical  appointments, medical examination results, pathologies, allergies, diagnosis and treatment  plans (medical information), administrative and financial information (invoices, hospitalisation  papers, etc.).  Processing Purpose  Provision of healthcare services (diagnosis, treatment, hospitalisation), treatment planning and  billing  Data Subject Patients, relatives, doctors, nurses  Recipients of the Data Doctors and nurses, administration and accounting department, public health system, patients  Data Processor  IaaS Cloud service provider  ASSESSING CYBERSECURITY RISK IMPACT  When conducting a risk assessment for similar use cases, healthcare organisations should take  into account the possible impact of a cybersecurity incident on confidentiality (e.g. data breach  leading to exposed patient data), integrity (e.g. alteration of important patient data) or availability  (e.g. timely access to patient data during emergency treatment). This would allow the healthcare  organisation to assign an appropriate quantitative or qualitative value to the risk impact  depending on the specific risk assessment methodology used. A brief description of factors to  be considered for risk impact assessment is listed below:  Factor Description  Confidentiality  Within the scope of the specific processing operation, the impact from loss of confidentiality is considerable  given the nature of sensitive information included in the EHR. Data subjects could be expected to encounter  significant adverse effects from unauthorised disclosure of their health data.  Integrity  The impact in case of loss of integrity should be considered particularly if the EHR includes important patient  data that may be used to influence medical decisions. Data subjects may encounter significant or even  irreversible consequences from unauthorised alteration of health data (signals and statistics), which could  even make it difficult for them to receive appropriate treatment.  Availability  Depending on the nature of data included in the EHR and the context of their use, loss of availability may also  be of significant impact. Inability to access the patient’s EHR may hinder timely and accurate treatment of the  data subjects, even putting their lives at risk.  CLOUD SECURITY FOR HEALTHCARE SERVICES  January 2021  23  ASSESSING RISK LIKELIHOOD  The table below describes how the main Cloud security threats may be relevant for the  reference Cloud architecture and the specific use case. Healthcare organisations should use  the information below when assessing the likelihood of a cybersecurity risk. It should however  be noted that the descriptions below only refer to the described use case and additional factors  related to the operational context of the healthcare organisation should be considered before  determining the risk likelihood.  Threat Description  Natural  phenomena  Typically, in such use cases the servers are located in data centres enforcing a suitable level of physical  security requirements, which tends to reduce the respective risk likelihood. Such data centres usually obtain  certificates that show that they are protected against fire, water, or earthquakes and the existence of such  certificates should be factored in the risk likelihood assessment.  Supply chain  failure  As the infrastructure is outsourced to Cloud providers the likelihood of this risk tends to be reduced. The failure  of power supply or other Cloud service disruptions is less likely because the providers are specialised in  maintaining their services. However, even big Cloud platforms are not entirely immune to outages of their Cloud  infrastructure.  Human error An undefined number of employees may be performing personal data processing, and there is no clear policy  regarding granular access to health records. This should be considered as a factor that increases risk  likelihood. Human actors' common mistakes in this use case are the usage of default or weak passwords, lack  of access control to sensitive data, non-compliance with security policies, or the possibility of human error.  However, the obligations of all parties involved in the process should be clearly defined, and awareness-raising  seminars should be organised periodically.  Malicious  actions  Many parties such as healthcare organisations, patients, and public health officials are strongly interconnected in  this Cloud system, which is difficult to isolate from malicious actors completely. Malicious attackers may also be  internal actors who might have direct or indirect access to the Cloud services. Potential attacks in this area might  involve social engineering (e.g., phishing), theft, espionage, malware (e.g., ransomware), or denial of service  attacks. A database containing electronic health records of almost every citizen in a specific country stored  centrally may be an attractive target for malicious attackers. On the other hand, Cloud service providers can  bundle the knowledge of internal and external security experts, which allows them to enforce security measures  more efficiently than proprietary data centres. These factors and especially the operational context of the  healthcare organisation and the Cloud service provider should be assessed when determining the risk likelihood.  System  failures  Software might have errors that cause the service to fail and become unavailable. The EHR is a very central  solution to share patient information and is even legally regulated and requires security certification in most  countries, reducing the occurrence probability. The government infrastructure typically also supports relevant  governmental services that require a stable availability of the services. It can therefore be assumed, that the  probability of system failures, especially hardware is usually relatively low. However, statistics on system  failures or SLAs from the Cloud service provider can provide a more accurate source of data to feed into the  risk assessment study.  4.2 USE CASE 2 – REMOTE CARE  Remote care (as part of Telemedicine) supports remote patient-doctor consultation and has  been increasingly used in recent times due to the pandemic and its circumstances. During  COVID-19, remote care/consultation has been a safe way to provide expert care and advice  lowering infection risk. In some countries, remote care is an established approach to overcome  centralised healthcare infrastructure and large distances. In this use case, we consider a service  provider that offers a video call platform for communication between health professionals and its  patients, individually or in group sessions. The service also offers recording, analysis, and  transcription of the calls to assist the health professionals with medical evaluations, diagnosis,  and documentation.  CLOUD SECURITY FOR HEALTHCARE SERVICES  January 2021  24  Figure 2: Cloud Architecture Model – Remote Care  OVERVIEW  Service Model SaaS Deployment model Public Cloud  Healthcare organisation  The healthcare organisation uses a telemedicine (including audio and video) application for its  doctor-patient consultation. The communication service is offered as a web and mobile  application. The healthcare professionals connect over the internet using a client to access the  Cloud service. Patients connect over the internet using either their computer or mobile phone.  Cloud service provider  The Cloud service provider is a communication technology company offering a SaaS  communication service. Its responsibility includes application development, maintenance, and  providing the underlying infrastructure.  DEFINITION OF PROCESSING OPERATION AND ITS CONTEXT  Personal data processed  Contact Information (last and first name, nickname), video recordings, transcriptions of  recordings  Processing Purpose Provision of healthcare services (patient-doctor consultation)  Data Subject Patients/Medical professionals  Recipients of the Data Medical professionals  Data Processor SaaS Cloud service provider  CLOUD SECURITY FOR HEALTHCARE SERVICES  January 2021  25  ASSESSING CYBERSECURITY RISK IMPACT  When conducting a risk assessment for similar use cases, healthcare organisations should take  into account the possible impact of a cybersecurity incident on confidentiality (e.g. data breach  leading to exposed patient data), integrity (e.g. alteration of important patient data) or availability  (e.g. timely access to patient data). This would allow the healthcare organisation to assign an  appropriate quantitative or qualitative value to the risk impact depending on the specific risk  assessment methodology used.  A brief description of factors to be considered for risk impact assessment is listed below:  Factor Description  Confidentiality  Within the scope of the specific processing operation, the impact from loss of confidentiality can be  considerable as the primary focus of such use cases involves the direct exchange of patient data. Data  subjects may therefore encounter significant adverse effects from unauthorised disclosure of their health  data.  Integrity  The impact of the loss of integrity will depend on the nature of the telemedicine/remote care application. For  non-critical consultation applications the impact may not be as significant, but depending on the context,  alteration of medical data could have high-impact consequences. Data subjects may encounter significant or  even irreversible consequences from unauthorised alteration of health data (signals and statistics), which  could even make it difficult for them to receive appropriate treatment.  Availability  Assessing the impact of loss of availability heavily depends on the context of the telemedicine/remote care  application. This may range from low in the case of standard consultations for which alternative methods of  communication can be used to very high in the case of emergency interventions of medical staff using the  telemedicine platform.  ASSESSING RISK LIKELIHOOD  The table below describes how the main Cloud security threats may be relevant for the  reference Cloud architecture and the specific use case. Healthcare organisations should use  the information below when assessing the likelihood of a cybersecurity risk. It should however  be noted that the descriptions below only refer to the described use case and additional factors  related to the operational context of the healthcare organisation should be considered before  determining the risk likelihood. Similarly the underlying telecommunications infrastructure-  backbone would be a risk factor, however not in the scope of this assessment.  Threat Description  Natural  phenomena  Typically, in such use cases, the servers are located in data centres enforcing a suitable level of physical  security requirements, which tends to reduce the respective risk likelihood. Such data centres usually obtain  certificates that show that they are protected against fire, water, or earthquakes and the existence of such  certificates should be factored into the risk likelihood assessment.  Supply chain  failure  As the infrastructure is outsourced to Cloud providers the likelihood of this risk tends to be reduced. The  failure of power supply or other Cloud service disruptions is less likely because the providers are  specialised in maintaining their services. However, even big Cloud platforms are not entirely immune to  outages of their Cloud infrastructure.  Human error (Video)Conferencing tools are considered standard IT equipment which makes it more likely that users are  familiar with this technology and the relevant interfaces. Especially during the pandemic situation, the  adoption of and familiarisation with videoconferencing solutions has increased significantly. Still, the risk  may be higher when medical staff are less familiar with or un-trained in the use of such tools.  Malicious  actions  During the pandemic, many stakeholders have switched to remote conferencing and telemedicine, which in  turn has led to such solutions becoming more attractive targets. Healthcare organisations also extended the  use of teleconsultation. Potential attacks in this area might involve social engineering (e.g. phishing), theft,  espionage, malware (e.g. ransomware), or denial of service attacks.  System  failures  Videoconferencing technology has been developed and improved for a long time, resulting in well- established software solutions. Nevertheless, software failure might still happen with low likelihood since  Cloud has enough redundancy.  CLOUD SECURITY FOR HEALTHCARE SERVICES  January 2021  26  4.3 USE CASE 3 – MEDICAL DEVICES  Medical device data is made available to different stakeholders using Cloud technology to  enable remote patient monitoring e.g. for heart disease or diabetes patients. Medical device  manufacturers also provide medical device monitoring using Cloud computing technology.  In this use case, we consider a medical device manufacturer that produces a device to measure  certain patient data (e.g. a pacemaker measuring heartbeat). The device itself is not able to  communicate over the internet. However, it can transfer measurements via Bluetooth to  smartphones with an appropriate app from the device manufacturer. The app can then transfer  the aggregated measurements for a month to a Cloud file storage provider and share this  information with the treating doctor.  Figure 3: Cloud Architecture Model - Medical Device  OVERVIEW  Service Model PaaS Deployment model Private Cloud  Healthcare organisation  The healthcare organisation offers its patients a medical device (e.g. pacemaker) that is  connected to their mobile device. Healthcare professionals can access the measured data over  the internet using their clients.  Medical device manufacturer  The medical device manufacturer offers a Cloud service for patient measurements (e.g.  measuring heartbeats) to healthcare organisations. The medical device manufacturer provides  the application and the device and ensures the connection to the Cloud service provider through  APIs for data transfer. It uses PaaS to securely develop and deploy the software, including  sending emails with individualised links containing the uploaded aggregated measurements.  Cloud service provider  The Cloud service provider provides the application platform, including application interfaces  and the underlying Cloud infrastructure that includes network, servers, operating systems, and  storage.  CLOUD SECURITY FOR HEALTHCARE SERVICES  January 2021  27  DEFINITION OF PROCESSING OPERATION AND ITS CONTEXT  Personal data processed Contact information (last and first name), health data (e.g. heartbeat) measurements  Processing Purpose Provision of healthcare services (e.g. sharing heartbeat measurements)  Data Subject Patients  Recipients of the Data Medical professionals  Data Processor  PaaS Cloud service provider  ASSESSING CYBERSECURITY RISK IMPACT  When conducting a risk assessment for similar use cases, healthcare organisations should take  into account the possible impact of a cybersecurity incident on confidentiality (e.g. data breach  leading to exposed patient data), integrity (e.g. alteration of important patient data) or availability  (e.g. timely access to patient data). This would allow the healthcare organisation to assign an  appropriate quantitative or qualitative value to the risk impact depending on the specific risk  assessment methodology used. While this specific use case only involves collection of patient  data that is then subject to examination by medical staff, other use cases involving medical  devices may include the device itself taking actions based on measurements, resulting in a  drastically different risk profile. A brief description of factors to be considered for risk impact  assessment is listed below:  Factor Description  Confidentiality  Loss of confidentiality for similar use cases may cause data subjects to encounter significant adverse effects  from unauthorised disclosure of their health data. Within the scope of the specific processing operation, the  impact from loss of confidentiality is not necessarily considered critical since the disclosure of  measurements such as heartbeats is usually not as severe as disclosing other health data. However if the  data is exchanged in its entirety through unsecure means (i.e. email) poses a risk in itself. In a broader  context, the impact of loss of confidentiality for use cases involving medical devices depends on the nature  of the data involved in the operation.  Integrity  In the case of loss of integrity, data subjects may encounter significant or even irreversible consequences  from unauthorized alteration of health data. For instance, doctors may prescribe inappropriate medication.  This impact is heavily influenced by the overall treatment process; for instance, a doctor might notice  sudden deviations from regular measurements and doctors usually explain treatment procedures or  changes in medication via personal conversations, which might reveal the alteration of data. In the case of  more automated processes or even processes where the device can even act based on the data, the impact  of loss of integrity may be significantly higher.  Availability  The impact of loss of availability may range from moderate to critical depending on the frequency by which  the measurements need to be made available to medical staff or even the nature of the measurements (e.g.  when an anomaly in measurements may indicate a life threatening circumstance). The lack of data may  affect the patient’s health because unavailability affects intervention options.  ASSESSING RISK LIKELIHOOD  The table below describes how the main cloud security threats may be relevant for the  reference cloud architecture and the specific use case. Healthcare organisations should use the  information below when assessing the likelihood of a cybersecurity risk. It should however be  noted that the descriptions below only refer to the described use case and additional factors  related to the operational context of the healthcare organisation should be considered before  determining the risk likelihood.  CLOUD SECURITY FOR HEALTHCARE SERVICES  January 2021  28  Threat Description  Natural  phenomena  Typically, in such use cases the servers are located in data centres enforcing a suitable level of physical  security requirements, which tends to reduce the respective risk likelihood. Such data centres usually obtain  certificates that show that they are protected against fire, water, or earthquakes and the existence of such  certificates should be factored into the risk likelihood assessment.  Supply chain  failure  As the infrastructure is outsourced to Cloud providers, the likelihood of this risk rends to be reduced. The  failure of power supply or other Cloud service disruptions is less likely because the providers are specialised  in maintaining their services. However, even big Cloud platforms are not entirely immune to outages of their  Cloud infrastructure.  Human error The medical devices need to be configured and require patches. The lack of patches or adequate  configuration, procedures, or processing errors may leave the device vulnerable to cyberattacks.  Malicious  actions  The system handles patients' private information, which might be interesting for malicious actors. Malicious  attackers may also be internal actors who might have direct or indirect access to the Cloud services. Potential  attacks in this area might involve theft, espionage, malware (e.g., ransomware), or denial of service attacks.  On the other hand, Cloud service providers can have access to the knowledge of internal and external  security experts, which allows them to enforce security measures more efficiently than proprietary data  centres. These factors and especially the operational context of the healthcare organisation and the Cloud  service provider should be assessed when determining the risk likelihood.  System  failures  Medical devices undergo an extensive certification process that should impact occurrence probability  positively. The software to access the health data may be subjected to failures, but security requirements are  relatively high to ensure patient safety. Network and IT hardware failure may occur and depends heavily on  the location. However, there is very low probability for system failures due to the multi tenancy and  redundancy the Cloud services offer.  CLOUD SECURITY FOR HEALTHCARE SERVICES  January 2021  29  5. CLOUD SECURITY  MEASURES  This section provides a set of guidelines for ensuring cybersecurity and data protection for the  healthcare sector’s Cloud customers procuring and eventually providing Cloud-based  healthcare services. The security measures are based on common frameworks for Cloud  security such as BSI C5 and ANSSI Cloud recommendations, but also the ongoing work on  Cloud certification. This section contains the security measures with corresponding references  to the good practices of ENISA’s procurement guide and the use cases.  5.1 CLOUD SECURITY MEASURES AND GOOD PRACTICES  In general, the Cloud security measures, and the corresponding responsibility depend heavily  on the chosen service and deployment model.  Each Cloud security measure entails:   a reference to the good practices of the Procurement Guide (ENISA, 2020),   a reference to the use case, for which the measure is applicable,   an indication of the responsibility per use case and   additional data protection considerations.  The last item relates to how each security measure eventually satisfies a potential data  protection requirement and shows how through this measure acceptable implementation of the  requirement is met. Some use cases require stronger data protection measures due to the  criticality of the data and the evaluated risk. These enhancement considerations are attached to  the Cloud security measures where applicable.  SM-01 Identify security and data protection requirements  Involve necessary stakeholders such as risk, legal, compliance, or IT department in the procurement process. Requirements  solicitation should entail regulatory compliance.  Investigate and identify requirements such as:   local legislation and pan-area legislation for cloud security, cybersecurity and data protection   internal requirements such as information security policies   legal requirements which apply to a specific healthcare product, for instance, countries enforce specific security and  data protection requirements for electronic health records.   security and data protection requirements of the governmental Cloud service provider.  Check and assess legal requirements for data protection, cybersecurity, and Cloud security. Reconcile legal requirements with  the security controls of the Cloud service provider. In this case, it would be essential for the health care organisation to tag and  assign data based on sensitivity levels, and ensuring that is provided to the CSPs so they can assign higher or lower levels of  controls depending on the data.  Request evidence from the Cloud provider such as certification from third-party auditors to ensure the Cloud provider's adherence  to recognised standards.  Ensure that responsibilities for ensuring compliance between the Cloud customer and Cloud service provider are identified and  understood.  Address security and privacy requirements in the service level agreement between the Cloud customer and the Cloud service  provider. Require proof from the CSP for ensuring compliance with the requirements.  Reference to Good Practice Procurement GP 1.

Ensure privacy by design principles are followed both for the HCO and the CSP  based on the service model followed.  Cloud customer must ensure that data is securely transferred and verified at a  safe location before the cloud provider could permanently delete the data. The  cloud customer should be responsible for this timely data transfer and the  contractual needs to allow for a proper transfer.  SM-02 Conduct a risk assessment and data protection impact assessment  Conduct a risk assessment according to national guidelines or following a well-known methodology (find some here23) to identify  cybersecurity and data protection threats and risks for new Cloud services and evaluate the impact on the overall IT security risk  Conduct a data protection impact assessment when procuring Cloud services (ENISA tool for evaluating the risk of personal data  processing operation24)  Ensure alignment with the healthcare organisation’s risk appetite by identifying and implementing controls to mitigate identified  risks to the organisation’s risk acceptance level, by refraining from procuring the Cloud service or choosing another provider.  Monitor the risk landscape continuously to be able to identify emerging risk or to enforce further controls.

The Cloud service provider should have a process for handling security incidents according to European or national  legislation.  Identify the responsibilities of Cloud customers and Cloud service providers in the case of a security or data protection incident.  Ensure that internal measures, processes, and roles are in place and aligned with the Cloud service provider’s security  provisions.  Test security incident processes in collaboration with the Cloud service provider and verify how a security incident can be  reported to the Cloud service provider.  Request reports from the Cloud service provider for detected security incidents and the status monitoring of reported security  incidents by the Cloud service provider.  Ensure SLA contains at least performance indicators of defined availability and capacity of the Cloud service, response and  reaction times of the Cloud service provider’s service organisation, notification of predefined maintenance or other planned  downtime, and occurred security incidents either by default or on request.

Ensure  patients/customers are  informed if their data  has been subject to a  security incident.  Ensure legal obligations  to notify are met.  Ensure patients are  informed if their data  has been subjected to a  security incident.  Ensure legal obligations  to notify are met.  For Cloud customer:  ensure the contact  person at the Cloud  service provider is  reachable 24/7 and  response is guaranteed  within a predefined time.  SM-04 Ensure business continuity and disaster recovery  Ensure the Cloud provider notifies planned downtime several days in advance.  Define processes for business continuity and identify the Cloud service provider’s and Cloud customer’s responsibility in the event  of a service disruption. Ensure the Cloud service provider has an effective business continuity management plan (based on best  practices or national guidelines).  Test the business continuity process and ensure that key roles are familiar with their tasks.  Define and document procedures and responsibilities for critical operations that can damage assets stored in the Cloud  computing environment.  Examples of the critical operations are:   installation, changes, and deletion of virtualised devices such as servers, networks, and storage;   termination procedures for Cloud service usage;   backup and restoration.  Ensure monitoring of these operations by a supervisor.  Disaster recovery and data restore  CLOUD SECURITY FOR HEALTHCARE SERVICES  January 2021  32  Identify disaster recovery and data restore requirements of the healthcare organisation. Assess whether the Cloud service needs  provision from two separate locations that give each other redundancy.  Ensure disaster recovery and restore processes of the Cloud service provider are aligned with these identified requirements.  Identify the emergency contact of the Cloud service provider.  Request a test protocol from the Cloud service provider that shows successful disaster recovery and data restore process testing.  Backup  Ensure adequate backup (i.e., offsite backup or a multi-Cloud approach) to ensure business continuity in case of Cloud service  provider failure or data loss.  If the event backup is part of the Cloud service, define or identify backup requirements following information security policies and  legal requirements (to ensure compliance).  Request information on the Cloud service provider's backup capabilities and verify that these meet backup requirements.  Implement backup capabilities if the Cloud provider does not provide them, or the requirements are not met.  Reference to Good Practice Procurement GP 6.

Proper permanent deletion of data upon  customer’s or data subjects is the full responsibility of the Cloud provider.  Data deletion  Ensure data is deleted according to recognised standards or techniques, meaning permanently and irretrievably deleted, and  taking into account backup and log data.  Termination  Request a description of the termination process, disposal and return of Cloud customer’s asset and reuse of resources from the  Cloud service provider.  Ensure the description contains a list of all the assets and documents the schedule for the termination of service, which should  occur promptly.  Reference to Good Practice Procurement  Application to Use Case  Use Case 1 Use Case 2 Use Case 3  x x x  Responsibility  Cloud Customer  Cloud Service Provider x x x  Additional data protection considerations  All necessary measures to ensure data deletion should be in place and  documented in data retention policy (including technical means to support data  stored in several systems). The policy should also include cases of data  replication (storage in multiple sites) which would mean enabling tracing of the  data to ensure complete deletion. Client-side encryption versus server-side  encryption could be a solution to this25.  25 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/privacy-and-security-in-personal-data-clouds  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/privacy-and-security-in-personal-data-clouds  CLOUD SECURITY FOR HEALTHCARE SERVICES  January 2021  33  SM-06 Auditing, logging and monitoring  Define or identify requirements for event logging (for instance, audit trails for patient to control access to their EHR, retention of  logs) and verify if the Cloud service provider meets those requirements.  Determine and evaluate the adequacy of the Cloud service providers logging capabilities for privileged operations. Ensure  privileged operations delegated to the Cloud service provider are logged, and the Cloud service provider provides corresponding  log reports on request. Request documentation from the Cloud service provider of service monitoring capabilities and ensure the  monitoring data is consistent with event logs and SLA terms.  Ensure that the Cloud service provider meets the agreed capacity requirements through continuous monitoring. Monitor and  forecast the use of Cloud services to promptly communicate changes in capacity to the Cloud service provider and ensure quick  adjustment.  Implement additional logging capabilities to close the gap between the Cloud service provider's logging capabilities and the Cloud  customer’s requirements.  Ensure data retention for log data follows legal requirements. Ensure log data is also deleted in the case of termination or change  of provider.  Auditing the Cloud provider is a rather cumbersome task for the healthcare organisation to take over; auditing takes place at  specific intervals to ensure compliance and certification maintenance.

Review the Cloud provider’s encryption practices to ensure they meet the required encryption level, are compatible with other  cryptographic protection, and meet regulatory requirements.  Ensure data transfer from and to the Cloud service for all incoming and outgoing connections is encrypted.  (note for the author: Encryption in transit is always a shared responsibility- the Cloud customer needs to take the appropriate  measures to ensure that encryption will function properly (i.e. provider or patient using outdated browsers with known  vulnerabilities in encryption protocols will result into breaking the encryption measures applied by the CSP).

Identify cryptographic keys for each Cloud service and manage them according to defined requirements and procedures.  In the event the cloud service provider offers key management functionality, request documentation from the Cloud service  provider on the type of keys used, specifications of key management covering procedures for each stage of the key lifecycle such  as generating, changing/updating, string, retiring, retrieving and destroying.  Ensure keys are stored on certified devices (for example, hardware security modules), which ensure the level of protection for the  key material.  Ensure segregation of duties is in place for the key management and is enforced by technical or organisational means.  Ensure a process for recovering encryption keys is in place.  Evaluate an encryption approach (provider- or client-managed key or hold- your-own-key) based on the risk analysis for your data  and business. Where possible, use a client server-managed key.

CONCLUSION  For a number of years healthcare organisations have been contemplating moving part of their  ICT infrastructure and services to the Cloud. Over this period, a number of healthcare-specific  solutions have been developed using a variety of service models and deployment models fit for  purpose. The on-going pandemic has further highlighted the importance of certain healthcare  services that could benefit significantly from a move to the Cloud. The potential improvements in  availability, scalability and reliability of services such as telemedicine, wider deployment and use  of EHR and medical devices for remote patient care come on top of the cybersecurity, economic  and efficiency benefits Cloud services can bring to healthcare organisations.  Yet, the level of adoption of Cloud services in healthcare remains low and generally limited to  administrative processes. A number of factors contribute to this, including lack of trust in Cloud  services, lack of expertise, compliance requirements, particularly in relation to data protection,  and more.  This report aims to help healthcare organisations in taking the next step towards further  adoption of Cloud services. Built around three standard use cases of Cloud services in a  healthcare context, this report highlights the main factors to be considered from a cybersecurity  and data protection standpoint when assessing the relevant risks. The factors can be used in  any risk assessment methodology that the healthcare organisations are currently using.  Moreover, the report proposes a set of security measures for healthcare organisations to  implement when planning their move to Cloud services. These measures cover both  cybersecurity and data protection aspects and are linked to the procurement guidelines for  healthcare organisations previously published by ENISA.  While this report is a step towards supporting healthcare organisations in taking the next step  towards Cloud services it is not enough on its own. Healthcare organisations would require  additional support, such as specific guidance from national and EU authorities, industry  standards on Cloud security, especially in a healthcare context, clear guidelines from Data  Protection Authorities on moving healthcare data to the Cloud and collaboration with Cloud  service providers and medical device manufacturers to develop suitable Cloud solutions.

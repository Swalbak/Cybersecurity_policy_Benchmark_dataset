The Regulation provides for a harmonization of the legal data protection  regime throughout the EU, re-enforces several principles and obligations of the Directive, it repeals and  adds new provisions, including ones on data protection certification, seals and marks. Data protection  certifications, seals and marks have the potential to play a significant role in enabling data controllers to  achieve and demonstrate compliance of their processing operations with GDPR provisions. An additional  function of certification, in the context of the GDPR, is to enhance transparency, since certifications, seals,  and marks allow data subjects to “quickly assess the level of data protection of relevant products and  services”. The objective of this report is to identify and analyse challenges and opportunities of data  protection certification mechanisms, including seals and marks, as introduced by the GDPR, focusing also  on existing initiatives and voluntary schemes.  Certification, as a conformity assessment activity against specified requirements, is performed and  attested by a third party. These requirements are derived from technical standards or legislation, as in the  case of certification under GDPR, where the secondary EU legislation provides the normative framework as  a basis for the assessment requirements. The outcome of a successful certification (process) is a certificate  (thus a document), and/or a seal, that attests that the applicant organisation meets the requirements  (substantive and procedural) specified in the certification scheme, and provided in technical standards or  legislation. In the near future, it is also possible that such requirements, originating from GDPR provisions,  are also provided in technical standards.  Certification can be mandatory, when a relevant obligation for certification is established in legislation or  voluntary when such obligation is not legally imposed, as in the case of GDPR certifications, which rely on  the decision of a data controller or a processor to submit oneself to the certification procedure.  Certification, under GDPR, is well linked to the newly introduced principle of accountability and appears to  be limited to substantive requirements related only to GDPR provisions, must concern specific processing  operations and can only be pursued only by data controllers or data processors, as they perform the  personal data processing.  Currently, several privacy and data protection related certifications exist that are targeted at products and  services, processes, and management systems  and are based on either the existing legislation or technical  standards. Certifications based on the management standards, such as the ISO/IEC 27001 may target a  single business process, a particular service or the whole business process of an organization. There are  also certifications such as EuroPrise, which focus on the processing operations performed within a service  or by a product. The CNIL privacy seals offer a variety of scopes, which range from governance, products  (digital safe boxes), procedures (audit procedures covering the processing of personal data) to courses  (data protection training courses). Certifications targeting governance aspects and management systems  are different from certifications targeting processing (processing as such or processing as part of a service  1 Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 on the protection of  natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, and repealing  Directive 95/46/EC (General Data Protection Regulation), L 119/1 4.5.2016  Recommendations on European Data Protection Certification  Version 1.0  |  November 2017  06  or a product). Certifications on management and governance issues are more “process-oriented” than  “goal-oriented”.  The data protection mechanisms of GDPR Articles 42 and 43 can be considered as goal-oriented  certifications; the focus should not be only on whether measures are in place, but also to what extent such  measures are sufficient in ensuring compliance. However, the GDPR provisions on certification also  introduce a number of challenges that relate to the interpretation of provisions and the terminology, the  disposal of different accreditation models, the consistency of benchmarks and approval procedures by  competent authorities and connected questions of mutual recognition and harmonization at national and  European level.  Following the analysis, the main recommendations of the report are listed below.   National certification bodies and supervisory authorities (DPAs), under the guidance and support of  the European Commission and the European Data Protection Board (EDPB), should pursue a common  approach on inception and deployment of GDPR data protection certification mechanisms.   The European Data Protection Board (EDPB), in close cooperation with national certification bodies  and supervisory authorities (DPAs), should promote an EU scalable approach with approved and widely  accepted criteria.   National certification bodies and supervisory authorities (DPAs), with the support of the European  Data Protection Board (EDPB) and the European Commission, should provide guidance and promote  best practises to ensure consistency and harmonization in the deployment of GDPR data protection  certification mechanisms.   The European Commission and the European Data Protection Board (EDPB) should stimulate the  establishment of safeguards that will ensure trustworthiness and transparency of the certification  process.   The European Commission and the European Data Protection Board (EDPB), in close cooperation with  national certification bodies and supervisory authorities (DPAs), should stimulate the exchange of best  practises and lessons learnt from certification practices in other well established domains (e.g.  cybersecurity).  Recommendations on European Data Protection Certification  Version 1.0  |  November 2017  07  1. Introduction  The General Data Protection Regulation (EU) 679/2016 (‘GDPR’)2 will be, as of 25 May 2018, the main data  protection legal framework in EU directly applicable in all Member States, repealing the Data Protection  Directive 95/46/EC. The Regulation provides for a harmonization of the legal data protection regime  throughout the EU, re-enforces several principles and obligations of the Directive it repeals and introduces  new provisions such as the data protection by design and data protection by default. In order to enhance  transparency of the processing operations of the data controllers and the processors, the Regulation  introduces also specific provisions on certification, seals and marks.  According to Article 42 of GDPR, “The Member States, the supervisory authorities, the Board and the  Commission shall encourage, in particular at Union level, the establishment of data protection certification  mechanisms and of data protection seals and marks, for the purpose of demonstrating compliance with  this Regulation of processing operations by controllers and processors”. In the Recitals of the Regulation, it  is stated, “In order to enhance transparency and compliance with this Regulation, the establishment of  certification mechanisms and data protection seals and marks should be encouraged, allowing data  subjects to quickly assess the level of data protection of relevant products and services”.3  Against this background, in accordance with its 2017 Programming Document4, ENISA initiated a project in  the area of data protection certification mechanisms, seals or marks with the aim of imprinting the current  landscape and providing guidance for further work in the field. This project was executed in parallel to the  Agency’s activities in the area of cybersecurity certification in order to be afterwards able to draw useful  conclusions, experiences and best practises from both domains.  This report is the result of this work and is  expected to consist the basis of the comparative analysis described earlier that can be carried out in the  next years.  Objectives of the report  The objective of this report is to identify and analyse challenges and opportunities of data protection  certification mechanisms, including seals and marks, as introduced by the GDPR, focusing also on existing  initiatives and voluntary schemes.  More specifically the report aims at:   Elaborating on the main aspects of certification, seals and marks in personal data protection.   Identifying existing certifications in the greater area of privacy and/or data protection.   Identifying the main challenges and opportunities, both at organizational and technological level, of  data protection certification regime under GDPR with a look towards a common EU data protection  certification framework.   Making proposals for future steps, both at technological and organisational level, towards data  protection certification that would be a contributor to greater compliance with data protection rules in  the EU.  2 Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 on the protection of  natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, and repealing  Directive 95/46/EC (General Data Protection Regulation), L 119/1 4.5.2016  3 Recital 100 GDPR  4 ENISA (2016) ENISA Programming Document 2017-2019 : Available at  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/corporate/enisa-programming-document-2017-2019/view  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/corporate/enisa-programming-document-2017-2019/view  Recommendations on European Data Protection Certification  Version 1.0  |  November 2017  08  Methodology  The report was supported by an expert group, comprising of: Jelena Burnik (Data Protection Authority of  Slovenia) and Irene Kamara (Tilburg University and Vrije Universiteit Brussel)5. The research was based on  a literature review, legal analysis, and analysis of certifications. Several standards were reviewed, together  with selected existing certification schemes in the broader area of privacy, data protection and conformity  assessment. Significant studies in the field of Privacy seals and certification formed a useful basis for the  analysis of certifications, but also for the identification of issues and challenges of certifications deployed  before the GDPR came into play. The GDPR, especially Articles 42 and 43 of the GDPR, were analysed to  provide insights on the newly introduced data protection certification mechanisms.  Structure of the report  Section 2 of the report introduces basic certification concepts and makes correlations with the data  protection and privacy terminology as used in the GDPR. It aims at familiarising data protection experts  with the terminology of certification and clarifying concepts that are relevant to the GDPR certification,  established in Articles 42 and 43 of the GDPR. Section 3 introduces the key elements of Articles 42 and 43  of the GDPR. Section 4 presents an overview of the research and analysis conducted on the existing  certification schemes relevant to data protection. This part aims to provide insights on how the market of  data protection certification works, before the GDPR applies, and offer lessons for the data protection  certification mechanisms of Art. 42 and 43 of the GDPR. Section 5 focuses on the open questions and  challenges for the establishment and successful take-up of the certifications, but also for the role of  certifications as a transparency and accountability instrument under the GDPR. Lastly, section 6 concludes  the report with recommendations, drawn based on the lessons learned from the analysis of existing  certification schemes and the analysis of the GDPR provisions. These recommendations are meant to  provide high-level guidance to supervisory authorities, certification bodies, and controllers/processors that  intend to be involved in certification in the field of data protection.  5  Disclaimer: Any views expressed in this report by the members of the expert group only reflect their own views and  analysis and do not necessarily reflect or in any way prejudice the views of organizations they are affiliated with.  Recommendations on European Data Protection Certification  Version 1.0  |  November 2017  09  2. Basic concepts in certification  The General Data Protection Regulation introduces provisions on certification to enhance transparency of  the processing operations of the data controllers and the processors. The legislature also envisaged a role  of certification in assisting controllers and processors to demonstrate compliance with the Regulation6. The  following section outlines the main aspects in existing certification practice7, as applicable to the newly  established data protection certification regime under the GDPR.  Normative basis  Certification is a conformity assessment activity.8 Certification entails “the provision of assessment and  impartial third-party attestation that fulfilment of specified requirements has been demonstrated”9. The  requirements are usually derived from technical standards or legislation. The latter is the case of  certification in the field of data protection, where the secondary EU legislation safeguarding the right to  protection of personal data provides the normative framework as a basis for the assessment requirements.  It is also possible that requirements are embedded in a technical standard, which is inspired by the GDPR  provisions. The GDPR provisions need to be further elaborated to be fit-for-purpose for certification. As  the ISO/IEC 17067:2013 standard provides “where it is necessary to elaborate upon the requirements to  remove ambiguity, the explanations should be formulated by competent people and should be made  available to all interested parties”.  Third-party assessment Vs self-assessment  As its definition makes clear, certification is a third-party conformity assessment activity. The assessment is  performed by a party, other than the organisation that seeks certification (first party) and other than the  entity (if any) requiring the organisation to be certified (second party). In terms of data protection, the first  party assessment would be a data controller or a processor self-assessing its compliance with the GDPR.  This model would resemble a data protection impact assessment, in terms of the actors involved in the  process and the nature of a self-assessment exercise. A second party assessment would take place when a  data controller assesses whether a data processor, with which it collaborates, complies with the General  Data Protection Regulation. In that case, a data controller would be the second party in the assessment  process. Certification however requires assessment by a third independent party, which usually is a  certification body. In the case of the GDPR, as explained in section 3, the third party may be either an  accredited certification body or a Data Protection Authority. It is important to stress that while third-party  assessment leads to certification, self-assessment does not lead to certification. The self-assessor may  issue a self-declaration of conformity, but such a declaration has nothing to do with Art. 42 and 43 GDPR.  6 As set out in GDPR Recital 100 and GDPR Article. 42 paragraph 1  7 For example in the context of well established procedures of certification against international ISO/IEC conformity  assessment standards and other.  8 The ISO/IEC 17000 standard defines conformity assessment as: “demonstration that specified requirements  (relating to a product, process, system, person or body are fulfilled”  9 ISO/IEC 17067:2013  Recommendations on European Data Protection Certification  Version 1.0  |  November 2017  10  Certification scheme  A certification scheme is a document that includes the rules, procedures, and management for carrying out  certification for a specific product, process, or service.10 The owner of a certification scheme may be a  certification body, a public (supervisory) authority (for instance a data protection authority), or a private  actor (which nevertheless is not itself active in the sector targeted by its certification scheme).  Certification requirements, procedural aspects and criteria  Following the non-harmonised terminology in the field of certification, several terms are used to signify  identical concepts. According to the terminology proposed by ISO and IEC, a certification requirement is a  requirement “that is fulfilled by the client as a condition of establishing or maintaining certification”. The  term includes both the substantive requirements (otherwise called ‘product/process/person’  requirements) and procedural requirements. The substantive requirements are derived from the  normative basis. Data subjects’ rights (Arts. 15-22 GDPR), data security (Art. 32 GDPR), data protection by  design (Art. 25 (1) GDPR) and data protection by default (Art. 25(2) GDPR) offer, for instance, a normative  basis that may be further specified in substantive certification requirements. At the same time, procedural  requirements are also part of a certification scheme and necessary to be fulfilled by the party seeking  certification.11 Such procedural requirements would for example specify under which conditions a data  controller may use the acquired certificate, what are surveillance periods, the compensation structure, etc.  Some of the procedural aspects are already clarified by the GDPR – for example the length of certification  validity of 3 years (Art. 42(7)). Some existing certification schemes might use the term ‘criteria’ to signify  the substantive (product/process/person) requirements.12 The GDPR seems to refer to the substantive  requirements as the “criteria” and to procedural requirements as “requirements”.  Certificates, seals and marks  The outcome of a successful certification (process) is a certificate (thus a document), and/or a seal, that  attests that the applicant organisation meets the requirements (substantive and procedural) specified in  the certification scheme, and provided in technical standards or legislation. As the following sections of the  report indicate, there is no uniform approach in practice on the outcome of a successful certification  process. In some cases, there is sector-specific legislation that defines the terms and clarifies their legal  significance. In the context of electronic identification and trust services for electronic transactions, the  Regulation 920/2014 defines ‘electronic seal’ as “data in electronic form, which is attached to or logically  associated with other data in electronic form to ensure the latter’s origin and integrity”13 and a ‘certificate  for electronic seal’ as a “an electronic attestation that links electronic seal validation data to a legal person  and confirms the name of that person”14.  Certification schemes may provide that a successful assessment  leads to a certificate or a seal or both.  In addition, there might also be a mark available for use by the organisation that was granted with  certification. Such a mark or logo is a sign of a successful certification process. The terms ‘mark’,  ‘trademark’ or ‘trustmark’ are sometimes used interchangeably in practice, but ‘trademark’ also bears  10 This generic definition based on the ISO/IEC 17067:2013. The issue of the subject matter of the data protection  certification mechanisms as provided in the GDPR is further discussed in section 5.  11 The ISO/IEC 17065:2012 standard provides examples of such requirements. One example is the payment of fee  from the applicant organisation to the certification body.  12 An example is the EuroPrise certification.  13 Art. 3(25) Regulation 910/2014  14 Art. 3(29) Regulation 910/2014  Recommendations on European Data Protection Certification  Version 1.0  |  November 2017  11  legal significance, as it implies a registered trademark in line with national or regional legislation.15 The role  of the mark is to identify the issuer and the aspects covered by the mark in a clear way.16  Accreditation  According to the Regulation 765/2008 (: Accreditation Regulation) accreditation is “an attestation by a  national accreditation body that a conformity assessment body meets the requirements set by harmonised  standards and, where applicable, any additional requirements including those set out in relevant sectoral  schemes, to carry out a specific conformity assessment activity.” In other words, accreditation aims to  ensure that the certification body, or any other conformity assessment body, has the necessary  competence to carry out its tasks. The assessment in the framework of accreditation is not limited to  independence, capacity, resources, and other requirements, but extends to the subject matter, such as for  instance competence in information security or data protection matters. Each Member State has, in  principle, one National Accreditation Body (NAB) which grants accreditation certificates to conformity  assessment bodies. Even though in general a certification body may operate without being accredited, this  is not the case for the data protection certification mechanisms of the GDPR, as Art. 43 explicitly requires  accreditation of the certification body.  Mandatory Vs voluntary certification  Certification may be mandatory, when a relevant obligation for certification is established in legislation.  Examples of mandatory certification exist in the EU legislation, but are scarce.17 The most common  mandatory mark is the CE marking, which however, is not considered certification, but self-declaration of  conformity. Any entity is free to declare its compliance with the harmonised legislation imposing the  obligation to bear a CE marking, in principle, without an assessment from a third independent body. In the  field of EU data protection, both under the Data Protection Directive 95/46/EC and the GDPR, data  protection certification is voluntary. The voluntary nature of certification relates to the decision of a data  controller or a processor to submit oneself to the certification procedure.18 Furthermore, a controller or  processor may choose other or additional means to demonstrate compliance with its legal obligations  stemming from the GDPR.  Privacy-seals Vs data protection certifications  One last clarification should be made regarding the distinction between privacy-related certifications and  seals on the one hand, and data-protection certifications and seals on the other. Such a distinction follows  the distinction of the right to protection of personal data and the right to respect private and family life,  15 For instance, in line with Art. 27(1) of the Directive (EU) 2015/2436, a certification mark means a “trade mark which  is described as such when the mark is applied for and is capable of distinguishing goods or services which are certified  by the proprietor of the mark in respect of material, mode of manufacture of goods or performance of services,  quality, accuracy or other characteristics, from goods and services which are not so certified”.  16 ISO/IEC 17030:2013  17 Directive 2004/49/EC establishes safety certification granted by a public authority as a mandatory requirement for  a railway undertaking to be granted access to a railway infrastructure.

(2017)  Recommendations on European Data Protection Certification  Version 1.0  |  November 2017  12  home and communications.19 This study is primarily concerned with the GDPR certification, which is data  protection certification.20  19 Read further De Hert P. and S. Gutwirth (2008), Gonzalez-Fuster G. (2014)  20 Despite the focus of the study being data protection certification, the research for the following sections was not  limited to strictly data protection related certifications, which are still limited in number due to the newly introduced  provisions in the EU data protection legislation (Art. 42 and 43 GDPR).  Recommendations on European Data Protection Certification  Version 1.0  |  November 2017  13  3. Main elements of GDPR Articles 42 and 43  The GDPR introduced certification as a means for a data controller or a data processor to demonstrate  compliance of a processing operation with the Regulation. An additional function of certification in the  context of the GDPR is to enhance transparency, since certifications, seals, and marks allow data subjects  to “quickly assess the level of data protection of relevant products and services”.21  Certification as an accountability-based mechanism  Certification is well linked to the newly introduced principle of accountability. As already highlighted by the  Article 29 Data Protection Working Party in 2010, data protection needed additional mechanisms that  translate legal requirements into real data protection measures.22 Certification and seals are treated as  accountability-based mechanisms, due to their potential effect to facilitate scalability, compliance,  transparency, and to some extent legal certainty.  Art. 5(2) GDPR requires the data controller to both comply with the principles relating to the processing of  personal data and demonstrate its compliance. Demonstration of compliance in practice may require  multiple actions, such as proper documentation and record keeping (in line with art. 30 GDPR).  Certification can play a role in that respect; a controller that has had its processing operations successfully  evaluated by a certification body, may use the certification and its supporting documentation as an  element to demonstrate compliance to the supervisory authority. The fact that data protection  certification in the GDPR is an accountability-based mechanism is supported by its voluntary nature.23  Certification of compliance with GDPR provisions  As the GDPR provides in Art. 42 (4), a certification pursuant to this Article does not reduce the  responsibility of the controller or the processor for compliance with this Regulation, meaning that  compliance with the GDPR is not possible to be certified. What can be certified, is compliance with (or else:  conformity to) certification criteria that are derived from the GDPR. Compliance with such criteria entails  that a controller or processor at a certain period in time has taken measures to ensure that it fulfils certain  obligations, for instance to secure personal data in a given processing operation.  In general, where the EU legislature, intends to assign a different effect to certification or self-declaration  of conformity, this is explicitly provided in the legislation. For instance, conformity with harmonised  standards that are developed on the basis of the New Approach Directives, offer a presumption of  conformity with the legislation and this is explicitly provided for in the relevant law. Similarly, the CE  marking offers specific effects in relation to the safety of the products. This is not the case in the GDPR,  which does not assign such legal effects to certifications.  Key actors: Certification bodies and Supervisory authorities  The data protection mechanisms as proposed in Art. 42 and 43 GDPR involve mainly the following actors:   The data controller or data processor that aims to apply for certification (‘applicant’)   The certification body   The supervisory authority (data protection authority)  21 Recital 100 GDPR.  22 WP29 (2010), Opinion 3/2010 on the principle of accountability, WP173.  23 Art. 42 (3) GDPR.  Recommendations on European Data Protection Certification  Version 1.0  |  November 2017  14   The European Data Protection Board (EDPB)  The certification bodies and the supervisory authorities are key actors in the certification process.  Certification may be conducted by either a certification body that fulfils the conditions of art. 43 GDPR, or  by a supervisory authority. The GDPR does not determine when the process is conducted by a certification  body and when by a supervisory authority. This legal gap appears to be intentional: Member States and  national supervisory authorities may organise certification at a national level according to their preferred  model. However, we should note the inherent risk to the possibility of cross-border recognition of the  certifications that lies with the adoption of diverse models across Member States, as discussed later in  section 5.  After the evaluation phase, in the case that the applicant fulfils the necessary requirements, certification is  granted by the certification body or the supervisory authority. Certification is issued for three years, and  may be renewed. It is important to mention that even when the certification body issues the certification,  the supervisory authority has several powers, such as to withdraw the certification or order the  certification body to withdraw the certification.24  The supervisory authorities also have the power to approve criteria for certification. Not every certification  in the field of data protection is automatically a data protection certification mechanism as provided in the  GDPR. The national supervisory authority needs to formally approve the certification criteria. Such  approval may constitute an administrative act, with legal effects.25  The European Data Protection Board (EDPB) takes the role of the national supervisory authorities, as  outlined above, in the case of a European Data Protection Seal. The European Data Protection Seal is a  common EU-wide certification, the criteria of which, are approved not by one or more national data  protection authorities, but by the European Data Protection Board.  Scope of certification under GDPR  As highlighted, not every certification in the field of data protection is automatically a data protection  certification mechanism as provided in the GDPR. In fact, the GDPR appears to be quite limiting when  providing the scope of processing activities where data controllers and processors can use certification as  an element to show compliance. The scope is mainly limited by the following conditions:  1. Purpose of certification  According to Article 42 of GDPR, “The Member States, the supervisory authorities, the Board and the  Commission shall encourage, in particular at Union level, the establishment of data protection  certification mechanisms and of data protection seals and marks, for the purpose of demonstrating  compliance with this Regulation of processing operations by controllers and processors”. The purpose of  a data protection certification mechanism under GDPR is thus demonstrating compliance with the  Regulation of processing operations by controllers and processors, which clarifies that the substantive  requirements a client must fulfil must be related to the provisions of the GDPR, for example to  demonstrate compliance with the provision on data security (Art. 32). If a certification mechanism  involves a scope that is not in the scope of the GDPR, for example a data protection education course,  24 Art. 42(7) GDPR.  25 Data Protection Authorities are independent authorities of public (administrative) law. It follows therefore, that the  decision of the Data Protection Authority approving or rejecting criteria for certification may be challenged before  national administrative courts.  Recommendations on European Data Protection Certification  Version 1.0  |  November 2017  15  such a mechanism cannot be used to demonstrate compliance with the GDPR. Such a certification  mechanism would therefore not be in the scope of Art. 42 and 43 GDPR data protection certification  mechanisms. Nevertheless, such certification may exist in the free market and potentially contribute to  raising the levels of data protection awareness.  2. Processing operation  The object of certification must be a processing operation. The GDPR regulates the processing of  personal data, which may be conducted in the context of a product or system or a service. However, the  wording of Art. 42(1) requires that a certification mechanism under GDPR must concern an activity of  data processing. Such an activity may be (also an integral) part of a product, a system, or service, but the  certification must be granted in relation to the processing activit(ies), and not to the product, system or  service as such (e. g. certification of data deletion process in product X).  3. Controllers or processors  The reference to “by controllers or processors” limits the scope of applicants that can opt for  certification under the GDPR to controllers and processors. Producers or manufacturers of products,  systems and services, if they do not process any personal data, as controllers or processors, are not in  the scope of the GDPR certification mechanisms.26  Nevertheless, there might be certifications in the market, aimed at manufacturers (e.g. OS providers and  mobile device manufacturers), in relation to data protection-friendly configuration of products or  systems, which will undoubtedly contribute to raise the level of data protection. However, they will be  outside of the scope of the GDPR data protection certification mechanisms of Art. 42 and 43 GDPR  Accreditation of certification bodies  A substantial part of the GDPR provisions on certification refers to accreditation. The legislature  emphasises the importance of having reliable, competent, and independent bodies carrying out the  certification by devoting Art. 43 GDPR to certification bodies. Art. 43 GDPR requires the certification bodies  that provide data protection certifications to be accredited. The GDPR allows the Member States to select  the accreditation model they will follow, from a selection of three options:  a. accreditation by a Data Protection Authority (or the European Data Protection Board, in the case of the  European Data Protection Seal)27,  b. accreditation by the National Accreditation Body on the basis of the Accreditation Regulation and the  ISO/IEC 17065:2012 standard and additional requirements in the field of data protection provided by  the Data Protection Authority, or  c. both authorities, namely the National Accreditation Body and the competent Data Protection  Authority, collaborating in this task.  26 The provision of Art 42(7) GDPR reiterates the position: “Certification shall be issued to a controller or processor for  a maximum period (..)”  27 Art. 70 (1) (o) GDPR.  Recommendations on European Data Protection Certification  Version 1.0  |  November 2017  16  4. Existing data protection-related certification schemes  In this section, the existing certification landscape in the EU and outside the EU is reviewed, with the aim  of drawing experience already available in the market. Previous research has identified and analysed  several certifications, which have in a broad sense a focus on privacy, data protection and data security.28  The findings suggested that only a small number of EU schemes can be said to relate to the Data  Protection Directive 95/46/EC or the GDPR. Transparency of the certification process, criteria, and  assessment methodology has also been identified as a problematic area.29  Parameters of analysis  To further build on that foundation, the present study focuses on a limited number of existing  certifications that have been identified as the most relevant for discussion in relation to the GDPR  provisions, due to i) their focus on privacy and data protection, ii) requirements based on the EU data  protection legislation or relevant international standards, iii) organisational structure and iv) maturity in  the market. Selected existing certification schemes are presented, analysed according to a number of key  parameters, mainly corresponding to open issues, challenges and opportunities of certification under the  GDPR.  The analysis does not aim to be exhaustive, but to provide a grasp of the current landscape and offer  insights for the GDPR certification. The parameters are summarized below:   Subject matter and scope of certification is concerned with how existing schemes define their scope  and identify what can be certified according to their requirements – whether it is only the data  processing activities that can be certified or the entire products, services or systems. The aim of  certification is also of interest in this regard.   Normative basis. This parameter refers to the normative basis of the analysed certifications.  Subsequently, it is important to identify how the criteria are formulated and to what extent the  certifications offer assurance of compliance with the GDPR or assure that a controller or a processor  “has measures in place to comply with legislation/standard.   Certification process of the analysed certifications is examined, including the roles of involved  stakeholders, the role of the certification body in terms of its independence, the stages of the  certification process, how information is exchanged, the measures that need to be implemented by  the applicant, how the certificate is granted and under which conditions. The GDPR does not instruct  specifically on the process of certification, hence the aim of analysis is to identify the stages of the  certification processes.   Duration of the certification process, post-certification surveillance of issued certifications, validity  period of certification are described, where available, in search of current practices that could inform  future decisions regarding these topics, that are not generally specifically provided for by the GDPR  (except for the length of validity of the certificate).   Accreditation of the certification bodies. The GDPR requires that only certification bodies that are  accredited may grant certifications, and provides for several options of accreditation, either by the  28 Rodrigues R. et. al, 2013 , ENISA, 2013  29 Rodrigues R. et. al, 2013  Recommendations on European Data Protection Certification  Version 1.0  |  November 2017  17  DPA or the national Accreditation body.30 Hence it is important to look at the existing certification  landscape from this aspect.31  Bellow the results of the analysis are presented in relation to the above identified criteria. The analysed  certifications are the following:   ePrivacyseal EU   EuroPrise   CNIL Labels   ICO Privacy Seal (under development)   Certification based ON ISO/IEC 27001   Certification based on ISO/IEC 27018   PrivacyMark system   Privacy by Design by Ryerson University and Deloitte Canada  Subject matter and scope of certifications  The analysis of the scope and subject matter of the existing certifications revealed variations in the existing  practices. Several certifications target products and services, others processes, and others management  systems. Certifications based on the management standards, such as the ISO/IEC 27001 may target a single  business process (e.g. in human resources), a particular service or the whole business process of an  organization. Similarly, the Privacy Mark System (from Japan) focuses on the assessment of a Personal  Information Protection Management System (PMS). The aim of the assessment is to determine whether  the applicant organization manages adequately risks on handling personal information. There are also  certifications such as EuroPrise, which focus on the processing operations performed within a service or by  a product. Within the scope of the EuroPrise certification are IT products such as hardware and software,  IT based services and automated processing of data.  The CNIL privacy seals offer a variety of scopes, which range from governance, products (digital safe  boxes), procedures (audit procedures covering the processing of personal data) to courses (data protection  training courses). Regarding services that are provided by more than one service providers, CNIL provides a  “joint privacy seal”.32 The certifications based on the ISO/IEC 27018 standard target processes that relate  to the processing of Personally Identifiable Information (PII) for providers of public cloud services.  Certifications targeting governance aspects and the management systems are different from certifications  targeting processing (processing as such or processing as part of a service or a product). Certifications on  management and governance issues are more “process-oriented” than “goal-oriented”. The auditor in the  ISO/IEC 27001 certification will ask the applicant whether for instance a Data Retention Policy is in place.  On the other hand, a “goal-oriented” certification is not focusing primarily on the measures taken, but  whether the measures are sufficient to fulfil certain pre-determined goals. The “goal-oriented”  certification therefore focuses more on qualitative elements. To return to the previous example, the  30 See section on ‘Error! Reference source not found.’  31 In the Annex of the Report there is an additional parameter is considered on Resources needed to obtain  certification, in terms of fees as well as organisational resources. The GDPR points to the usefulness of certification  schemes for smaller organizations and companies, hence it will be considered whether a lightweight version of the  scheme already exists among the analysed certifications. The number of issued certificates, where available, is  included in the overview.  32 https://www.cnil.fr/fr/node/682  https://www.cnil.fr/fr/node/682  Recommendations on European Data Protection Certification  Version 1.0  |  November 2017  18  auditor would not only examine whether there is a Data Retention Policy in place, but also whether the  Policy addresses issues that need to be covered by such a policy in the specific organization etc. Such  different approaches have an impact on the effort and the resources the applicant needs to invest, but  also the level of assurance they offer. The data protection mechanisms of Art. 42 and 43 can be  characterised as goal-oriented certifications, as the focus should not be only on whether measures are in  place, but also to what extent such measures are sufficient.  Normative basis and compliance with the legislation  The analysed certifications are based on either the legislation or the technical standards. The ePrivacyseal  derives its criteria from what it refers to as “applicable EU Data Protection Directives” and the GDPR.  Additionally, there is a set of criteria related to Online Behavioural Advertising. The criteria refer to  grounds for processing, data protection principles, and subjects’ rights. EuroPrise certification is based on  the Directive 95/46/EC (and the GDPR) and the ePrivacy Directive.33 The PrivacyMark is based on a  Japanese standard, the requirements of which relate to personal information protection policy,  specification of personal information, relevant legislation, implementation and operation, documentation,  complaints mechanisms, inspections, and preventive actions.  The Privacy by Design certification is neither based on legislation nor a technical standard, but the  Framework of 7 Foundational Principles for Privacy by Design.34  On the topic of the assurance in relation to compliance with the legislation, there can be three main  approaches that are listed below.  4.3.1 Certifications that are independent from legislation  Such are the certifications based on the ISO/IEC standards or other normative documents, such as the  Privacy by Design Principles framework. The Privacy by Design certification provided by Ryerson University  and Deloitte Canada does not signify compliance with the Ontario privacy laws. The ISO/IEC 27018  standard for instance states that it “establishes commonly accepted control objectives, controls and  guidelines for implementing measures to protect Personally Identifiable Information (PII) in accordance  with the privacy principles in ISO/IEC 29100 for the public cloud computing environment”35 These  certifications also do not use legislation as the normative source, but instead use other technical  standards. They may take into account existing legislation, in the sense for instance that the requirements  in the standard may not contradict the legal obligations. However, no direct references to the law are  made.  4.3.2 Certifications that use the legislation as a source for their substantive criteria  The ePrivacyseal EU claims that it attests a product’s “compliance with the list of ePrivacyseal EU criteria,  which reflects the requirements imposed by EU data protection legislation.”36 In that sense, such  certifications do not directly promise to offer compliance with the data protection legislation. They use  33 Directive 2002/58/EC, amended in 2009.  34 By Ann Cavoukian https://www.ipc.on.ca/wp-content/uploads/Resources/7foundationalprinciples.pdf  35 ISO/IEC 27018:2014 “Information technology - Security techniques - Code of practice for protection of personally  identifiable information (PII) in public clouds acting as PII processors”, section 1 (“Scope”)  36 ePrivacyseal EU website: https://www.eprivacy.eu/en/privacy-seals/eprivacyseal/  https://www.ipc.on.ca/wp-content/uploads/Resources/7foundationalprinciples.pdf https://www.eprivacy.eu/en/privacy-seals/eprivacyseal/  Recommendations on European Data Protection Certification  Version 1.0  |  November 2017  19  however the legislation as their normative framework. The criteria for each certification reviewed are  provided as part of Annex A.  4.3.3 Certifications that provide assurance of compliance with the legislation  An example is the CNIL case. The aim of the CNIL privacy seals is to provide a recognition from the French  Data Protection Authority to the applicant that its product, course, procedure “corresponds to the  requirements of the Data Protection Authority” (“confidence indicator”).37  Another example in this stream  is EuroPrise.38  It should be noted that attestation provided by a data protection authority, should not be misinterpreted  as assurance of compliance with the legislation, provided by the authority, in its supervisory role. In view  of avoiding such implications, the CNIL provides a clarification that the CNIL Privacy Seals do not aim to  exempt its holders from administrative fines.39 A different approach was proposed by ICO. ICO announced  in 2015 its plans to introduce a national privacy seal. The aim was to deliver a stamp that an organization  “demonstrates good practice and high data protection compliance standards.” What was interesting about  the announced ICO privacy seals, is that the seal would not only demonstrate compliance with the  requirements of the UK Data Protection Act, but would also show that the certified organization surpasses  the legal requirements and went “above and beyond the call of duty”.40  Certification process  The certification processes of the analysed certifications follow similar, but not identical approaches. The  models usually include:  1. a stage of application and first assessment of the application,  2. evaluation by expert auditors/assessors which leads to an evaluation report,  3. the decision (by person(s) other than the auditor(s)),  4. granting of certification and  5. possibility for re-certification  The exact models and expertise of the certification procedures provide useful examples and good  practices. EuroPrise collaborates with legal and technical experts, which are admitted as experts by  EuroPrise.41 The EuroPrise experts evaluate the product or service and report their findings in an  evaluation report. The Certification Authority (EuroPrise) checks the evaluation report with respect to  completeness, plausibility, and comparability with other certifications. It then drafts an internal  certification report, awards the seal, and publishes a short report. The CNIL employs a Labelling  Committee, at the evaluation stage, which performs the legal analysis, develops recommendations and  plans for corrective actions. The decision is made by the Data Protection Authority in its plenary meeting.  The granting of the CNIL Privacy Seal is published on the website of CNIL and the Official Journal  (Legifrance). The ePrivacyseal includes a workshop in a preparatory stage before the actual evaluation.  37 https://www.cnil.fr/fr/node/682  38 EuroPrise website for instance provides: “We certify the privacy compliance of IT products and IT-based services  with European data protection regulations” https://www.european-privacy-seal.eu/EPS-en/About-EuroPriSe  39 CNIL provides: “The privacy seal informs the public that the procedure or product proposed corresponds to the  requirements of the Data Protection Authority. In this, it plays the role of a confidence indicator. It does not aim to  exempt its holders from administrative formalities.” https://www.cnil.fr/fr/questions-reponses-sur-les-labels-cnil  40 See ICO blog 28 January 2015 https://iconewsblog.org.uk/2015/01/28/what-you-need-to-know-about-ico-privacy- seals/  41 See website of EuroPrise: https://www.european-privacy-seal.eu/EPS-en/Expert-admission  https://www.cnil.fr/fr/node/682 https://www.european-privacy-seal.eu/EPS-en/About-EuroPriSe https://www.cnil.fr/fr/questions-reponses-sur-les-labels-cnil https://iconewsblog.org.uk/2015/01/28/what-you-need-to-know-about-ico-privacy-seals/ https://iconewsblog.org.uk/2015/01/28/what-you-need-to-know-about-ico-privacy-seals/ https://www.european-privacy-seal.eu/EPS-en/Expert-admission  Recommendations on European Data Protection Certification  Version 1.0  |  November 2017  20  During the workshop, legal and technical experts examine the product or service based on the relevant  technical, organizational, and legal requirements.  The Privacy by Design certification has its evaluation and decision phases performed by different  organisations. Deloitte is responsible for scrutinizing the product or service and issuing a report, while the  Privacy by Design Centre of Excellence of the Ryerson University issues a decision on granting the  certification. This is a best practice as it provides guarantees for independence of the actors involved in  each stage. The well-established Privacymark system collaborates with over one thousand assessors,  assessment and training bodies. The assessment of conformity with the standard has two stages, namely  the assessment of the documentation and on-site assessment.  The duration of the certification process is usually not specified. This shortcoming may be attributed to the  diversity of the applications, the size of the organisations, ranging from large industry with complex  systems to SMEs, and varying risk in the operations and systems of the applicants.  With regard to the possibilities of an applicant to challenge the decision of the certification body or  authority to grant the certification, there should be a distinction between internal dispute resolution  mechanisms and judicial review. EuroPrise for instance has a dispute resolution mechanism in place.42 CNIL  on the other hand, does not have such processes in place. However, this does not mean that a rejection  decision by CNIL cannot be challenged. The decisions of supervisory authorities are subject to  administrative law judicial review but for specific grounds, foreseen in national administrative law. The  decision of CNIL to reject an application for certification may therefore be appealed to the Conseil d’Etat  within two months from the publication of the decision.43 This situation is different than the certifications  issued by private organisations. Such organisations might have a dispute resolution mechanism, as  mentioned above, but their decisions can be subject to judicial review by civil law courts (in civil law  juridictions), instead of administrative courts. The legal grounds may potentially be derived from contract  law, due process issues, and competition law issues.  Post-certification stage and monitoring of granted certifications  With regard to the post-certification stage, the analysed certifications follow different practices. In most of  the cases, there is a follow-up after granting the certification. CNIL reserves the right to perform checks at  any time and by any means that the certified product or procedure complies with the conditions of  certification. If such conditions are no longer met, CNIL may withdraw the granted privacy seal (and  certification).  A different model is followed by the Ryerson Privacy by Design certification. The certification  is valid for three years, but each organization needs to renew on an annual basis the certification. The  renewal requires an attestation from the organization that there has not been any change affecting the  granted certification and the payment of a renewal fee. Certifications based on ISO/IEC standards may  include a post-certification surveillance stage, when following the ISO/IEC conformity assessment  standards. According to the ISO/IEC 17065 standard, surveillance44 is necessary for continuing use of a  certification mark which is authorized for placement on a certified product, process or service.  Accreditation  The analysed certifications do not follow common approaches. The ICO seal, which is under development,  follows an approach close to the GDPR accreditation model: the certification body that will be granting the  42 https://www.european-privacy-seal.eu/EPS-en/Dispute-Resolution  43 https://www.cnil.fr/en/all-you-should-know-about-privacy-seals  44 “Surveillance” is defined as “systematic iteration of conformity assessment activities as a basis for maintaining the  validity of the statement of conformity” ISO/IEC 17000 standard.  Recommendations on European Data Protection Certification  Version 1.0  |  November 2017  21  ICO Privacy Seal has to be accredited by the National Accreditation Body (UKAS45) and meet additional  criteria established by the Data Protection Authority. CNIL, grants the seals and has not outsourced this  activity. CNIL is not accredited. The PrivacyMark system, EuroPrise and ePrivacy are not using accredited  certification bodies by the National Accreditation Bodies. Instead, they have a system of training or  accepting trained experts and auditors. The certifications based on the ISO/IEC standards on the other  hand are often granted by accredited National Certification Bodies.  45See website of the UK National Accreditation Body  www.ukas.com  http://www.ukas.com/  Recommendations on European Data Protection Certification  Version 1.0  |  November 2017  22  5. Data Protection Certification: Challenges and open questions  The following section focuses on several challenges that data protection certification under GDPR is likely  to face. Some challenges stem from the GDPR provisions itself, which are only to some extent in harmony  with existing (more mature) frameworks in certification and accreditation in other fields, close to the field  of data protection (cybersecurity, eIDAS Regulation, etc.), while others are a consequence of (national and  international) diversity of the privacy and data protection certifications, that already exist in the market.  Terminology  The meaning of some terms used in GDPR is unclear, among them the term “criteria”. In the certification  context in other sectors the term “requirement” is regularly used to signify the specific levels of service or  contents that have to be fulfilled by an applicant, whereas the term “criteria” is not defined unitedly.  In  some certifications, as highlighted in Chapter 2, the term criteria is used to signify substantive  requirements. The same goes for certification mechanisms/seals/mark, which the GDPR uses collectively,  without differentiating among the legal concepts.  It is important to note, that although certification has not been formally recognized by legislation in the  data protection field before GDPR, certification as a process is already operational in other areas and  sectors – such as security, safety, etc. It is thus important not to reinvent the vocabulary for certification in  data protection that would differ from other areas in general terms, to avoid confusion on the part of  actors already providing certification or actors taking part in standard setting community that might be  also involved in data protection certification and standard setting. The same argument is applicable to  procedures normally known and respected in certification landscape, to which data protection certification  would preferably align.  Subject matter of certification: processing operations  One significant issue relates to the aim and scope of the data protection certifications in line with Art. 42  and 43 GDPR. Approved certifications are mentioned in several provisions such as the data security (Art.  32) and data protection by design and by default (Art. 25).  The ISO/IEC conformity assessment standards  commonly refer to certification of products, services, process and persons.46 There are schemes available  on the market, already offering certification in such cases,47 especially in relation to products and systems  that are intertwined with data processing operations, such as different software used for data processing  or hardware and appliances that are essentially used for data processing activities. However, the wording  of GDPR, as shown in the Annex, is limiting in this regard as it only recognizes certification of processing  operations and not products or services as such. Additionally, it aims at controllers or processors who  might use the products or services designed for their data processing, and not the manufacturers or  produces of these products and services. Any data processing operation needs to be put in context to be  able to assess the data controllers’ or processor’s compliance with data protection rules (e. g. an online  booking system used in healthcare, processing sensitive data has different implications for the user than if  the same booking system was used in marketing, not processing sensitive data). Nonetheless, certification  of products and services, which enable compliant data processing operations of data controllers and  processors, may contribute to raising awareness and offering transparency on the activities of the  controller/processor, or the qualities of a product.  46 ISO/IEC 17065:2012, ISO/IEC 17021-1:2015, ISO/IEC 17024:2012  47 See Annex of the Report  Recommendations on European Data Protection Certification  Version 1.0  |  November 2017  23  Diversity in accreditation models  The GDPR leaves room for manoeuvre for the Member States to decide the accreditation model. The  challenges are linked to the resources the DPAs possess in relation to accreditation following ISO/IEC  17065:2012, if the Data Protection Authorities are to be accrediting by themselves, as well as the resources  and knowledge of accreditation bodies in additional data protection criteria. In practice cooperation  between the two authorities seems a viable solution, however procedures of cooperation need to be  specified and the additional data protection criteria harmonized across EU Member States.  Approval of criteria for certification by Data Protection Authorities and/or EDPB  The GDPR provides that the DPAs and/or the EDPB have the authority to approve criteria for certification.  However, the GDPR does not provide further guidance on benchmarks for the approval of the criteria by  the data protection authorities. Consistency is of utmost importance to ensure same level of quality of the  different data protection certifications.  It is important to arrive at common interpretations regarding approval of certification criteria that are  based on conformity against widely recognized international standards, such as the ISO standards. It is  important to clearly set the roles of EDPB and national DPAs in this regard and also to recognize the  importance of such international standards and their integration in the certification under GDPR. The role  of the Commission in regulating with implementing acts should also be taken into account. It needs to be  clarified who should seek approval of criteria.  EU level vs. national certifications: risks of proliferation of national certifications  As recognized by the GDPR and in other fields of certification, such as security,48 harmonization of  approaches to certification across the EU is a goal to be pursued, due to challenges, posed by proliferation  of nationally focused certifications49. Complex issues of mutual recognition arise in case of different  national approaches, in addition to transparency issues and, especially from the consumer side, lack of  recognition and trust in a potentially large number of seals offering different kinds and levels of protection  of their personal data, in the context of the single market. The GDPR specifically instructs the Member  States, Data protection authorities, the EDPB and the Commission to encourage, in particular at Union  level, the establishment of data protection certification mechanisms and of data protection seals and  marks. However, keeping the focus on harmonized approaches that could be valid throughout the EU  Member States will most likely be challenging; currently many certifications exist in Member States50, as  shown in section 2, most of them not being harmonized neither in terms of procedures nor requirements.  The emergence or recognition of certifications at the EU level will therefore need strong initiative from the  EDPB and/or the European Commission.  On the downside of single EU wide certification approaches, endorsed or developed by authorities, market  initiatives in development of very specialized certifications for specific, or even niche processing  48 Wurster S, et al. Consolidated report on security standards, certification and accreditation – best practice and  lessons learnt: Deliverable 2.2 for the CRISP project. CRISP project, 2015  49 As recognized also in the Discussion paper of Centre for Information Policy Leadership, on the role of certification  mechanisms under GDPR, highlighting the value propositions of the industry, data controllers and processors,  available at: https://www.huntonprivacyblog.com/wp- content/uploads/sites/18/2017/04/cipl_gdpr_certifications_discussion_paper_12_april_2017.pdf  50 In Germany alone more than 40 certifications in the data protection field exist; and updated list from February  2017 is available at: https://stiftungdatenschutz.org/fileadmin/Redaktion/PDF/Zertifizierungsuebersicht/SDS- Zertifizierungsuebersicht_02_2017.pdf.  https://www.huntonprivacyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/18/2017/04/cipl_gdpr_certifications_discussion_paper_12_april_2017.pdf https://www.huntonprivacyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/18/2017/04/cipl_gdpr_certifications_discussion_paper_12_april_2017.pdf https://stiftungdatenschutz.org/fileadmin/Redaktion/PDF/Zertifizierungsuebersicht/SDS-Zertifizierungsuebersicht_02_2017.pdf https://stiftungdatenschutz.org/fileadmin/Redaktion/PDF/Zertifizierungsuebersicht/SDS-Zertifizierungsuebersicht_02_2017.pdf  Recommendations on European Data Protection Certification  Version 1.0  |  November 2017  24  operations, may hamper the development of specific certifications targeting niche sectors. Mutual  recognition of such certifications across the EU should be an impetus in such cases.  Under the GDPR, the DPAs and the EDPB both have the task to approve certification criteria, submitted to  them by providers of data protection certification mechanisms, which may result in conflicting decisions.  That may be in the case of cross border providers of certifications, which might have gained approval of  their criteria in one Member State, but have been confronted with a negative decision by the EDPB or  another Member State. To ensure legal certainty these procedures will have to be streamlined and mutual  recognition issues considered also in the relation DPAs – EDPB.  Since many different forms of certifications under the GDPR may coexist, namely national, EU wide,  offered by public and private bodies, there is a risk of confusion on the market, and hence low trust in the  seals.51 The GDPR provides in Art. 42(8) that the EDPB shall collate all certification mechanisms and data  protection seals and marks in a register and shall make them publicly available by any appropriate means.  It is not clear however whether this only refers to the certification mechanisms approved by the EDPB  (with EU wide notion) or also to the national approved certification mechanisms.  Since under GDPR DPAs  will have to be informed about each issued or withdrawn certification, it would be beneficial, in terms of  transparency, trust, and mutual recognition issues, that the above register maintained by the EDPB would  include all approved certification mechanisms, either national or EU recognized.  Cross-border recognition of national certifications  The existence and prioritization of an open EU single market and the fact that many services (especially on  the internet) are cross border in nature, raises many important challenges of mutual recognition of the  certifications under the GDPR. For certification to be an efficient tool in aiding compliance with data  protection rules, it needs, among other conditions, to be recognized as beneficial by data controllers and  processors. The benefits may include showing accountability and demonstrating compliance, as well as the  effect of certification on graduation of sanctions and corporate liability 52.  a. Cross-border recognition of national certifications  Mutual recognition of certifications issued by authorities or certification bodies in different Member States  and possibly also by the EDPB is one of the crucial questions of added value of a certification to a data  controller or processor operating cross border. The challenges for mutual recognition of certifications are  linked to the:   Lack of harmonization of procedures and requirements in existing data protection certification  landscape which is likely to continue, as the GDPR allows many different forms of certification  formats to (co)exist.  This might be beneficial in terms of considering specific interests of sectors at  the level of Member States, however for cross border service providers lack of harmonization of  requirements and procedures is a direct obstacle in the motivation to invest in acquiring different  certifications in different Member States that are not mutually recognized.   Additionally, there will be challenges for DPAs, being faced with certifications data controllers and  processors have acquired in other Member States.  51 This can to some extent be observed from the US experience with seals where it is hard for an individual to assess  which certifications indeed have value in good protection of privacy (Rodrigues R. 2013)  52 Tomšič A, Burnik J, et al. Consolidated report on enhancing confidence and acceptability of new certification  measures. Deliverable D7.1 for the CRISP project. CRISP project, 2017. 19 p.  Recommendations on European Data Protection Certification  Version 1.0  |  November 2017  25  DPAs also have the authority to approve certification criteria. However, their procedures of approval are  likely to differ, which also means the results of their approval might differ in different Member States,  from, for example, a certification body, operating cross border, seeking approval of its certification criteria.  b. Recognition of certifications from outside the EU and certifications against international standards  Many data protection certification schemes currently exist outside the EU, and it is to be expected that the  issuers will either seek formal approval of their certification criteria from EU DPAs or that data controllers  from outside the EU that are conducting business in the EU will be looking for assurances based on their  certification acquired outside the EU. In such cases the same arguments of mutual recognition and  harmonization of such possible recognitions can be applied as above. It would be beneficial if decisions of  EU bodies regarding such foreign certifications were aligned and that they have the resources to be able to  arrive at such non-conflicting decisions (procedural guidelines, ways of informing each other, of  cooperating in procedures of recognitions and possible approvals).  Function creep of DPAs when acting as certification body/body approving criteria,  and supervisory authority  The GDPR allows different models of certification processes to (co)exist across Member States, also in  terms of the body issuing certification. Although there are many benefits of certification relevant for the  DPAs acting in their capacity as supervisory authorities (such as endorsement of compliance by soft  approaches, facilitation of inspection supervisions in cases where certification documentation is a  trustworthy demonstration of data controllers’ accountability and compliance), there are also challenges  to be avoided in case the DPAs opt for such a dual role. If the supervisory body both assesses conformity of  the applicant against requirements based on the GDPR and issues certification, while at the same being  entrusted with the power of supervision over the same processing operations of the data controller or  processor, challenges related to a conflict of interest arise. Even more so, if certification is provided for a  fee and the DPA is the beneficiary of the revenues from certification. If such a dual role is assumed by the  DPA, measures need to be put in place to mitigate risks of potential function creep. As all available models  come with specific challenges and advantages, depending also on the specificities of each Member State,  there cannot be, at least for now, a most or least preferable model.  Recommendations on European Data Protection Certification  Version 1.0  |  November 2017  26  6. Recommendations  The last part of this report outlines recommendations for development of the European data protection  certification under GDPR that would contribute to compliance and fulfil the aims of transparency and  accountability. The recommendations are relevant for the European Commision, the European Data  Protection Board (EDPB) and the supervisory authorities who are in position to develop common and  harmonized understanding of GDPR data protection certification mechanisms and provide further  guidelines and clarifications where open questions and challenges arise, as well as to the organizations  who are interested in issuing certifications or seeking certifications.  Common approach on GDPR data protection certification mechanisms  Due to the issues related to (non-existent) certification terminology in the text of the GDPR, but also issues  that might arise from the adoption of diverse accreditation models and certification processes, it is crucial  that the national supervisory authorities adopt a common approach. Such common approach and  understanding should be extended to all relevant issues of scope, aim, and criteria of the data protection  certification mechanisms under GDPR. This novel endeavour of certification stemming from secondary  data protection legislation should learn from examples in other fields, where such certifications are already  operational, but also successful existing certifications. Such an exercise based on existing knowledge can  function as a useful basis for the development of certifications in the field, to the extent permitted by the  conditions and requirements of the GDPR.  A common approach should also be adopted in relation to the criteria that are being approved by DPAs  and EDPB, most importantly regarding their level of detail and whether they are assessed directly against  GDPR or against a more developed list of broader criteria, developed on the basis of GDPR53. It is  important to deploy an aligned approach on whether the criteria only relate to the substantive  requirements based on GDPR or also to procedural requirements of a certification mechanism (or scheme),  such as the surveillance periods, the condition for granting the seal, etc.  The data subjects need to know whether a certification mechanism is approved in line with Art. 42 and 43  GPDR. For the certifications which are out of the scope of the GDPR certification provisions, any added  value to the contribution of raising awareness on data protection overall should be highlighted.  There should be procedures in place to aid data controllers and DPAs in cases that certifications issued in  one EU Member State are used in another Member State. Mechanisms to help could relate to provision of  information and documentation, but also mutual recognition. An example is a common register of all  issued/withdrawn certification mechanisms, and if possible certifications as well,  in all EU Member States  and development of guidelines as to the procedures that should be followed in mutual recognition  procedures.  National certification bodies and supervisory authorities (DPAs), under the guidance and support of  the European Commission and the European Data Protection Board (EDPB), should pursue a common  approach on inception and deployment of GDPR data protection certification mechanisms.  53 Such broad criteria and more specific requirements, developed on the basis of GDPR, are specified in a CEN  Workshop Agreement no.  17147:2017  , stemming form the foundations of EU co-funded project CRISP. Available:  https://www.nen.nl/NEN-Shop/Norm/CWA-171472017-en.htm  Recommendations on European Data Protection Certification  Version 1.0  |  November 2017  27  Guidance regarding open questions to ensure consistency  As the report highlights, there are several open questions, where guidance would be beneficial. Further  guidance is also in the interest of harmonization and with the look to future developments in the area of  privacy and data protection. The following topics would benefit from further guidance:  1) The procedures for mutual recognition of national certifications by the Data Protection Authorities  2) Compatibility of certifications based on international standards (such as ISO/IEC) and non-EU  certifications with GDPR  3) With regard to the Register with issued certifications to be kept by the EDBP:  a) Does it refer only to EDPB approved certification mechanisms, or to nationally approve as well?  b) Is it open to public?  c) Does it refer to certification mechanisms alone or to all issued certifications?  4) Accreditation models and procedures to avoid conflict of interests and ensure consistency with  Regulation 765/2008.  5) In relation to the criteria for certification, approved by DPAs and EDPB, guidance is necessary on:  a) What are the procedures for approval and how consistency can be ensured?  b) Are the criteria approved directly against GDPR provisions or against a list of broader criteria  specifying the GDPR provisions that may be developed by the authorities?  6) Common guidelines should be developed on the procedures that the DPA, as well as the EDBP, are to  follow in approval of certification criteria in order to achieve harmonization and avoid mutual  recognition issues.  7) Post-certification surveillance measures.  8) Transparency thresholds and complaints mechanisms.  National certification bodies and supervisory authorities (DPAs), with the support of the European  Data Protection Board (EDPB) and the European Commission, should provide guidance and promote  best practises to ensure consistency and harmonization in the deployment of GDPR data protection  certification mechanisms.  Safeguards to avoid function creep  The GDPR allows for different models of engagement of Data Protection Authorities in the processes of  accreditation and certification. In order to avoid function creep. It is recommended that a Data Protection  Authority does not function as the sole accreditation and certification body.  Additionally, in the case that a Data Protection Authority performs all the stages of certification, without  the involvement of a certification body, safeguards for mitigation of the risk of conflict of interest with its  supervisory capacity, should be put in place. Such measures may include separation of the staff conducting  certification from the staff conducting supervisory activities, resolution of the issue of monetary  compensation to the supervisory authority.  Recommendations on European Data Protection Certification  Version 1.0  |  November 2017  28  The European Commission and the European Data Protection Board (EDPB) should stimulate the  establishment of safeguards that will ensure trustworthiness of the certification process.  Approval of high-quality and transparent certifications with sufficient guarantees  As diverse certifications already exist on the market it is to be expected that this trend is likely to continue.  In this regard promotion of quality schemes is recommended in order not allow for the market to be  flooded with untrustworthy certifications. Simplicity, openness and transparency54 are among the most  important signs of quality of a certification mechanism that should include:   Transparent procedures and transparency regarding scheme fees   Publicly accessible summary reports on certifications, and   Publicity of criteria, requirements and methods for evaluation.   On spot audits in combination to documentation reviews   Regular post-certification surveillance and updates of certifications, when necessary   Transparent complaints mechanism   Auditors’ competences.  The European Commission and the European Data Protection Board (EDPB) should stimulate the  establishment of safeguards that will ensure transparency of the certification process.  Promotion of an EU approach  As recognized in other fields of certification, such as security,55 harmonization of approaches to  certification across the EU is a goal to be pursued, due to challenges, posed by proliferation of nationally  focused certifications in relation to market recognition, trust, economic factors and (legal) uncertainty. The  EDPD has the mandate to approve EU wide criteria, that lead to the European Data Protection Seal.  Scaling for SMEs  As provided by the GDPR, development of certification mechanisms should be encouraged, keeping in  mind specific needs of small, medium and micro enterprises (SMEs). There are many enterprises falling in  that category. At the same time, SMEs may be processing large quantities of personal data, which may  pose significant risks to individuals (for instance in the market of m-Health apps). As certification may be a  lengthy and costly process SMEs are unlikely to be motivated to undertake certification due to their  resource limitations. However, SMEs with low risk processing operations may benefit from using the  published approved criteria to assess their level of conformity. Such self-assessment would not lead to  certification or issuance of a seal, since it does not fulfil the conditions of Art. 42 and 43 GDPR.  54 Golyardi S, Hortensius D, Lau YY, Burnik J et al.

Recommendations on European Data Protection Certification  Version 1.0  |  November 2017  29  Nevertheless, it may still have an added value for the SMEs themselves and their demonstration of  compliance (with self-made documentation) to the supervisory authorities.  The European Data Protection Board (EDPB), in close cooperation with national certification bodies  and supervisory authorities (DPAs), should promote an EU scalable approach with approved and  widely accepted criteria.  Exchange best practices and lessons learnt with certification practises in other  domains  Data protection certification mechanisms, seals or marks under GDPR have specificities that do not allow  for a direct analogy with existing successful certification practises and approaches in other domains, such  as ICT security. GDPR provisions require that a certification mechanism must concern an activity of data  processing. Such activity may be (also an integral) part of a product, a system, or service, but the  certification must be granted in relation to the processing activit(ies), and not to the product, system or  service as such, which is not the case in the aforementioned example of ICT security certification.  Nevertheless, the experience accumulated and the best practises already implemented in other domains  could support European Commission, EDPB and national certification and supervisory authorities on  further laying out and implementing certification mechanisms under GDPR. Such experience56 can pertain  identification and analysis of relevant market needs and trends to better match demand and supply,  mutual recognition procedures, identification of standardisation gaps and coordination of standardisation  activities at EU level.  The European Commission and the European Data Protection Board (EDPB), in close cooperation with  national certification bodies and supervisory authorities (DPAs), should stimulate the exchange of  best practises and lessons learnt from certification practices in other well established domains (e.g.  cybersecurity).  56 See for example relevant ENISA’s work in this field: https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/standards/certification  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/standards/certification  Recommendations on European Data Protection Certification  Version 1.0  |  November 2017  30  7.

Recommendations on European Data Protection Certification  Version 1.0  |  November 2017  32  Annex A: Analysis of existing certifications overview  ePrivacyseal  ePrivacyseal  Scope & Subject matter  The ePrivacyseal certifies products or services, that are in line with the pre-determined  criteria catalogue of the ePrivacyseal scheme.57  Requirements & Normative basis  ePrivacyseal states that it derives the criteria from the ‘European data privacy law’, which  they refer to as the ‘applicable EU Data Protection Directives’ and the EU General Data  Protection Regulation. In addition, there is a set of criteria related to the ‘Online Behavioral  Advertising’ framework. In terms of topics, the criteria cover a broad range of topics, such as  the principles of processing, grounds for lawful processing, and data subjects’ rights.  Certification process  The certification process of the ePrivacySeal EU involves five stages:   Definition of targets   Workshop   Optimisation   Final Evaluation   Certification  Stages 1-3 are preparatory for the evaluation process (‘final evaluation’ stage). In the  context of the workshop, technical and legal experts examine the product or service on the  basis of relevant technical, organisational and legal requirements. The final evaluation stage  entails testing from the auditors according to the ePrivacy criteria catalogue and  recommendations for improvements. The final phase of the process is the application for  seal and the licensing of the ePrivacyseal.  ePrivacy provides that consulting and audit services are provided by the ePrivacy GmbH, the  assignment of the privacy seal occurs through another company, the ePrivacyseal GmbH.  Accreditation of certification body  The ePrivacy GmbH does not provide that it is itself an accredited certification body by the  National Accreditation Body of Germany, where the enterprise is established.  Duration of process Not specified  Post-certification surveillance Not specified  Validity period of certification Two years, re-certification is possible  Resources  Information regarding the costs of the services are available in the Terms and Conditions of  the ePrivacy.58  Issued certifications ePrivacyseal EU has been awarded to 27 companies (until September 2017)59.  57 The criteria catalogue is available online.  https://www.eprivacy.eu/fileadmin/Redakteur/PDF/Kriterienkataloge/ePrivacyseal_criteria_catalog_EU_july_2016.p df  58 General Terms and Conditions of Business, version of December 2016  https://www.eprivacy.eu/fileadmin/Redakteur/PDF/2016.12_ePrivacy_General_T_C_EN.pdf  59 https://www.eprivacy.eu/en/customers/awarded-seals/#seal5  https://www.eprivacy.eu/fileadmin/Redakteur/PDF/Kriterienkataloge/ePrivacyseal_criteria_catalog_EU_july_2016.pdf https://www.eprivacy.eu/fileadmin/Redakteur/PDF/Kriterienkataloge/ePrivacyseal_criteria_catalog_EU_july_2016.pdf https://www.eprivacy.eu/en/customers/awarded-seals/#seal5  Recommendations on European Data Protection Certification  Version 1.0  |  November 2017  33  EuroPrise  EuroPrise  Scope & Subject matter  The subjects of the scheme are IT products such as hardware (e.g., a hardware  firewall) and software (e.g., a database application in a hospital) and IT-based  services and automated processing of data (e.g., commissioned data processing,  websites). Evaluation of such a service includes auditing of live performance of  data processing. Evaluated is either the complete product (e.g., a piece of  software) or a part of a product. EuroPrise also certifies websites and  “commissioned data processing”.60  The aim of certification is increasing market transparency for privacy relevant  products and an enlargement of the market for Privacy Enhancing Technologies  and increase of trust in IT by certifying privacy compliance with European data  protection regulations (Europrise 2017).  Requirements & Normative basis  One list of criteria based on the Directive 95/46/EC and the ePrivacy Directive, and  a list of criteria based on the GDPR and the ePrivacy Directive are available on the  website of EuroPrise. The criteria are formulated as questions. According to  EuroPrise: “ Not each and every question will be applicable to each and every  product or service. The certification authority shall ensure that in any certification  procedure the relevant criteria are applied and that all related questions are  answered in a plausible manner, the appropriate granularity, and at a uniform and  comparable level.”61 However, there is no information available on the assessment  methodology on the applicability of such criteria.  Certification process  (1) EuroPrise experts evaluate the product or service  in line with the evaluation criteria specified for intended usage, legal framework  and technical environment of the product. They report their findings in an  evaluation report. The evaluation criteria include: overview of fundamental issues,  legitimacy of data processing, technical-organizational measures, data subject's  rights.  (2) Certification body checks the evaluation results  The certification body checks the evaluation report with respect to completeness,  plausibility and comparability with other certifications.  A certification report is  published. Additionally, a short public report summarizing the evaluation findings is  published.  (3) Award of European Privacy Seal  The certification body compiles an internal certification report, awards of the seal  and publishes of the short public report. The certification is granted by the  EuroPrise Gmbh, the only entity issuing certificates and performing certification  assessment.  Accreditation of certification body No information available  Duration of process Not specified  Post-certification surveillance Not specified  Validity period of certification Two years, re-certification is possible  60 https://www.european-privacy-seal.eu/EPS-en/certifications-offered  61 The criteria catalogue is available online.  https://www.european-privacy-seal.eu/EPS-en/Criteria  https://www.european-privacy-seal.eu/EPS-en/certifications-offered https://www.european-privacy-seal.eu/EPS-en/Criteria  Recommendations on European Data Protection Certification  Version 1.0  |  November 2017  34  Resources  Costs for the evaluation by the experts and fees for certification by the certification  bodies. The evaluation costs are negotiated between applicant and expert. The  costs for certification are set by certification body.  Issued certifications From 2008 until September 2017: 68 Certifications (including re-certifications)  Recommendations on European Data Protection Certification  Version 1.0  |  November 2017  35  CNIL Labels  CNIL Labels  Scope & Subject matter  The subject of certification may be any natural person or legal entity, whose  procedure or product corresponds to one of the standards published by the  CNIL in the Official Journal.  Requirements & Normative basis  Requirements are currently set in 4 standards:  1. Audit procedures covering the processing of personal data: The processing  audit privacy seal delivered by the CNIL does not directly apply to processing  carried out. It applies to the audit procedure which is used to check that these  processes are compliant with the French data protection act. The procedure  describes the various stages and processes according to which such an audit must  be prepared, implemented and finalised. It also includes requirements regarding  the organisation performing the audit, and the auditors themselves. It can be  issued for processing audit procedures carried out by service providers  (consulting firms, lawyers, etc.,) or by organisations (in this case, we speak of an  internal audit). CNIL’s privacy seal is delivered to legal and technical audits.  2. Data protection training courses: CNIL's privacy seal can be delivered for  internal training courses to an organisation, either for training courses in the  classroom or via e-learning, providing they meet the requirements of the  standard.  3. Digital safe boxes: they differ from a storage space in that the data that is  stored there (documents and some meta data) is only accessible to the holder of  the safe box, and to any persons whom he/she may have mandated. Service- providers who carry out a digital safe box (operators) or propose one to users  (suppliers) may apply for the privacy seal. The request may therefore be made  jointly by the operator and its customer (the supplier).  4. Personal Data governance procedures are all measures, rules and best  practices for managing an organisation's personal data. CNIL examines the  compliance of the request for certification of the organisation with 25  requirements, all cumulative, in the standard relative to three topics: internal  organisation of the management of personal data; the procedure for checking  compliance of processing with the Act; the management of complaints and  incidents (CNIL 2017).  5. A certificate is recognition by the CNIL that a product or a procedure is  compliant with the provisions of the French Data Protection Act. It does not aim  to exempt its holders from administrative formalities (CNIL 2017)  Certification process  The procedure consists of the following stages:  1. Application: the applicant sends its request on a form, available at the CNIL  website. It must provide all elements for demonstrating that its procedure or  product is compliant with the requirements of the standard.  2. Admissibility assessment: CNIL has 2 months to analyse the admissibility of  an application. Failing this, it is deemed to be admissible.  3. Examination by the Privacy Seals unit of CNIL where exchanges may take  place between the privacy seal division and the applicant to clarify some points  in the application.  Recommendations on European Data Protection Certification  Version 1.0  |  November 2017  36  4. Compliance assessment by the Labelling Committee: When examination by  Privy Seals Unit is complete, it is presented to the certification committee, which  performs Legal analysis, develops recommendations and plan of corrective  actions.  5. Presentation and granting of the privacy seal: The decision to deliver a  privacy seal is made by the Data Protection Authority meeting in its plenary  configuration.  6. Notification and publication. The decision is sent to the applicant,  accompanied by personalised logos in the name of the holder of the privacy seal,  as well as the regulations for using the brand, and it is published on the CNIL’s  website, then on Légifrance (CNIL 2017)62  Accreditation of certification  body  Not applicable (The seals are awarded only by the CNIL, there are no  certification bodies involved)  Duration of process  Examination of the application for certification takes place in two stages: the  admissibility of the application and the examination. The CNIL has 2 months to  analyse the admissibility of an application. The period of examination varies. The  privacy seal must be delivered within 6 months from reception of the last  elements necessary to satisfying the requirements of the standard.  Post-certification surveillance  The CNIL may check at any time and by any means that the certified product or  procedure complies with the conditions defined in the standard. CNIL can  withdraw a privacy seal. On its Internet site, the CNIL keeps an up-to-date list of  products and procedures that are certified, with the identity of their holders.  Validity period of certification 3 years, re-certification/renewal is possible  Resources  No fee is paid to CNIL for award of a seal. However, the applicant may need to  devote organization resources to comply with standards and adapt its practices.  Issued certifications  CNIL has issued 91 certifications (including re-certifications) until September  201763  62 See for instance:  https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichCnil.do?oldAction=rechExpCnil&id=CNILTEXT000032460877&fastReqId=183075 7081&fastPos=1  63 https://www.cnil.fr/fr/labels  https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichCnil.do?oldAction=rechExpCnil&id=CNILTEXT000032460877&fastReqId=1830757081&fastPos=1 https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichCnil.do?oldAction=rechExpCnil&id=CNILTEXT000032460877&fastReqId=1830757081&fastPos=1 https://www.cnil.fr/fr/labels  Recommendations on European Data Protection Certification  Version 1.0  |  November 2017  37  ICO Privacy Seal  ICO Privacy Seal (under development) *  Scope & Subject matter  In 2015, the UK Information Commissioner announced its intention to  introduce a national privacy seal, as a stamp of approval ‘which  demonstrates good privacy practice and high data protection  compliance standards’.64 The aim of the seal is not only to demonstrate  compliance of the certified organisation with the requirements of the  UK Data Protection Act, but to show that it surpasses the legal  requirements ‘when it comes to looking after people’s information’.  The ICO Privacy Seal will show that the certified organisation went  ‘above and beyond the call of duty’.  The scheme operators (other than the ICO) will focus on different  sectors, processes, products or areas of compliance.65  Requirements & Normative basis Requirements from the UK Data Protection Act  Certification process  Organisations wishing to apply for an ICO privacy seal will then be able  to make an application to a relevant scheme operator. Organisations  will be awarded an ICO privacy seal ‘if they can show that they meet  the operator’s assessment criteria and in doing so demonstrate that  they meet the highest data protection standards’. Despite not directly  involved in the process of awarding the ICO privacy seal, the data  protection authority will retain powers over the overall operation of  the seal, such as the power to withdraw the endorsement to a scheme  operator.  Accreditation of certification body  National Accreditation Body of the UK (UKAS)66 and will need to meet  additional criteria established by the ICO.  Duration of process Not specified  Post-certification surveillance  Not specified, only the intention of the ICO to retain powers over the  overall operation of the seal.

Certified organisation is able to identify and mitigate information  security risks to desired levels, improve trust into its services and  manage information security processes.  Requirements & Normative basis  ISO/IEC 27001 defines the mandatory requirements for an Information  Security Management System (ISMS).  Certification process  The certification process includes:  1. A two-stage initial audit, defined by the ISO/IEC 17021 and ISO/IEC  27006 standards,  where:  2. Stage 1 is dedicated to the review of the documented ISMS against  the standard,  and  3. Stage 2 to the review of the implementation of the ISMS within the  business and evidence of adherence.  4. Surveillance audits in the first and second years that are carried  out in order to verify that the organisation remain compliant to the  standard,  5. A recertification audit in the third year prior to expiration of  certification. The certification can later be renewed for subsequent  three-year periods (ENISA 2013).  6. The certificate can be revoked or suspended if the annual audit  finds reasons for it. The certification body suspends certification in cases  when, for example, the client's certified management system has  persistently or seriously failed to meet certification requirements,  including requirements for the effectiveness of the management  system, the certified client does not allow surveillance or recertification  audits to be conducted at the required frequencies, or the certified  client has voluntarily requested a suspension (ENISA 2013).  Accreditation of certification body  ISO directs its clients to accredited certification bodies, which have  acquired independent confirmation of competence by an Accreditation  Body. Accredited certification bodies must be able to offer certification  in conformity with ISO/IEC 17021-1 standard, which contains principles  and requirements for the competence, consistency and impartiality of  bodies providing audit and certification of all types of management  systems and ISO/IEC 27006 standard which provides requirements for  bodies providing audit and certification of information security  management systems (criteria document for accreditation, peer  assessment or other audit processes) (ISO 2017).  Duration of process  The length of the certification procedure as a whole depends on the  scope of certification. According to a previous study the time period  that was required for the surveyed companies in order to prepare for  Recommendations on European Data Protection Certification  Version 1.0  |  November 2017  39  the certification varied between 3 and 18 months, the majority of the  companies required about 6 to 12 months in order to complete the  preparation.

The Regulation provides for a harmonization of the legal data protection  regime throughout the EU, re-enforces several principles and obligations of the Directive, it repeals and  adds new provisions, including ones on data protection certification, seals and marks. Data protection  certifications, seals and marks have the potential to play a significant role in enabling data controllers to  achieve and demonstrate compliance of their processing operations with GDPR provisions. An additional  function of certification, in the context of the GDPR, is to enhance transparency, since certifications, seals,  and marks allow data subjects to “quickly assess the level of data protection of relevant products and  services”. The objective of this report is to identify and analyse challenges and opportunities of data  protection certification mechanisms, including seals and marks, as introduced by the GDPR, focusing also  on existing initiatives and voluntary schemes.  Certification, as a conformity assessment activity against specified requirements, is performed and  attested by a third party. These requirements are derived from technical standards or legislation, as in the  case of certification under GDPR, where the secondary EU legislation provides the normative framework as  a basis for the assessment requirements. The outcome of a successful certification (process) is a certificate  (thus a document), and/or a seal, that attests that the applicant organisation meets the requirements  (substantive and procedural) specified in the certification scheme, and provided in technical standards or  legislation. In the near future, it is also possible that such requirements, originating from GDPR provisions,  are also provided in technical standards.  Certification can be mandatory, when a relevant obligation for certification is established in legislation or  voluntary when such obligation is not legally imposed, as in the case of GDPR certifications, which rely on  the decision of a data controller or a processor to submit oneself to the certification procedure.  Certification, under GDPR, is well linked to the newly introduced principle of accountability and appears to  be limited to substantive requirements related only to GDPR provisions, must concern specific processing  operations and can only be pursued only by data controllers or data processors, as they perform the  personal data processing.  Currently, several privacy and data protection related certifications exist that are targeted at products and  services, processes, and management systems  and are based on either the existing legislation or technical  standards. Certifications based on the management standards, such as the ISO/IEC 27001 may target a  single business process, a particular service or the whole business process of an organization. There are  also certifications such as EuroPrise, which focus on the processing operations performed within a service  or by a product. The CNIL privacy seals offer a variety of scopes, which range from governance, products  (digital safe boxes), procedures (audit procedures covering the processing of personal data) to courses  (data protection training courses). Certifications targeting governance aspects and management systems  are different from certifications targeting processing (processing as such or processing as part of a service  1 Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 on the protection of  natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, and repealing  Directive 95/46/EC (General Data Protection Regulation), L 119/1 4.5.2016  Recommendations on European Data Protection Certification  Version 1.0  |  November 2017  06  or a product). Certifications on management and governance issues are more “process-oriented” than  “goal-oriented”.  The data protection mechanisms of GDPR Articles 42 and 43 can be considered as goal-oriented  certifications; the focus should not be only on whether measures are in place, but also to what extent such  measures are sufficient in ensuring compliance. However, the GDPR provisions on certification also  introduce a number of challenges that relate to the interpretation of provisions and the terminology, the  disposal of different accreditation models, the consistency of benchmarks and approval procedures by  competent authorities and connected questions of mutual recognition and harmonization at national and  European level.  Following the analysis, the main recommendations of the report are listed below.   National certification bodies and supervisory authorities (DPAs), under the guidance and support of  the European Commission and the European Data Protection Board (EDPB), should pursue a common  approach on inception and deployment of GDPR data protection certification mechanisms.   The European Data Protection Board (EDPB), in close cooperation with national certification bodies  and supervisory authorities (DPAs), should promote an EU scalable approach with approved and widely  accepted criteria.   National certification bodies and supervisory authorities (DPAs), with the support of the European  Data Protection Board (EDPB) and the European Commission, should provide guidance and promote  best practises to ensure consistency and harmonization in the deployment of GDPR data protection  certification mechanisms.   The European Commission and the European Data Protection Board (EDPB) should stimulate the  establishment of safeguards that will ensure trustworthiness and transparency of the certification  process.   The European Commission and the European Data Protection Board (EDPB), in close cooperation with  national certification bodies and supervisory authorities (DPAs), should stimulate the exchange of best  practises and lessons learnt from certification practices in other well established domains (e.g.  cybersecurity).  Recommendations on European Data Protection Certification  Version 1.0  |  November 2017  07  1. Introduction  The General Data Protection Regulation (EU) 679/2016 (‘GDPR’)2 will be, as of 25 May 2018, the main data  protection legal framework in EU directly applicable in all Member States, repealing the Data Protection  Directive 95/46/EC. The Regulation provides for a harmonization of the legal data protection regime  throughout the EU, re-enforces several principles and obligations of the Directive it repeals and introduces  new provisions such as the data protection by design and data protection by default. In order to enhance  transparency of the processing operations of the data controllers and the processors, the Regulation  introduces also specific provisions on certification, seals and marks.  According to Article 42 of GDPR, “The Member States, the supervisory authorities, the Board and the  Commission shall encourage, in particular at Union level, the establishment of data protection certification  mechanisms and of data protection seals and marks, for the purpose of demonstrating compliance with  this Regulation of processing operations by controllers and processors”. In the Recitals of the Regulation, it  is stated, “In order to enhance transparency and compliance with this Regulation, the establishment of  certification mechanisms and data protection seals and marks should be encouraged, allowing data  subjects to quickly assess the level of data protection of relevant products and services”.3  Against this background, in accordance with its 2017 Programming Document4, ENISA initiated a project in  the area of data protection certification mechanisms, seals or marks with the aim of imprinting the current  landscape and providing guidance for further work in the field. This project was executed in parallel to the  Agency’s activities in the area of cybersecurity certification in order to be afterwards able to draw useful  conclusions, experiences and best practises from both domains.  This report is the result of this work and is  expected to consist the basis of the comparative analysis described earlier that can be carried out in the  next years.  Objectives of the report  The objective of this report is to identify and analyse challenges and opportunities of data protection  certification mechanisms, including seals and marks, as introduced by the GDPR, focusing also on existing  initiatives and voluntary schemes.  More specifically the report aims at:   Elaborating on the main aspects of certification, seals and marks in personal data protection.   Identifying existing certifications in the greater area of privacy and/or data protection.   Identifying the main challenges and opportunities, both at organizational and technological level, of  data protection certification regime under GDPR with a look towards a common EU data protection  certification framework.   Making proposals for future steps, both at technological and organisational level, towards data  protection certification that would be a contributor to greater compliance with data protection rules in  the EU.  2 Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 on the protection of  natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, and repealing  Directive 95/46/EC (General Data Protection Regulation), L 119/1 4.5.2016  3 Recital 100 GDPR  4 ENISA (2016) ENISA Programming Document 2017-2019 : Available at  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/corporate/enisa-programming-document-2017-2019/view  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/corporate/enisa-programming-document-2017-2019/view  Recommendations on European Data Protection Certification  Version 1.0  |  November 2017  08  Methodology  The report was supported by an expert group, comprising of: Jelena Burnik (Data Protection Authority of  Slovenia) and Irene Kamara (Tilburg University and Vrije Universiteit Brussel)5. The research was based on  a literature review, legal analysis, and analysis of certifications. Several standards were reviewed, together  with selected existing certification schemes in the broader area of privacy, data protection and conformity  assessment. Significant studies in the field of Privacy seals and certification formed a useful basis for the  analysis of certifications, but also for the identification of issues and challenges of certifications deployed  before the GDPR came into play. The GDPR, especially Articles 42 and 43 of the GDPR, were analysed to  provide insights on the newly introduced data protection certification mechanisms.  Structure of the report  Section 2 of the report introduces basic certification concepts and makes correlations with the data  protection and privacy terminology as used in the GDPR. It aims at familiarising data protection experts  with the terminology of certification and clarifying concepts that are relevant to the GDPR certification,  established in Articles 42 and 43 of the GDPR. Section 3 introduces the key elements of Articles 42 and 43  of the GDPR. Section 4 presents an overview of the research and analysis conducted on the existing  certification schemes relevant to data protection. This part aims to provide insights on how the market of  data protection certification works, before the GDPR applies, and offer lessons for the data protection  certification mechanisms of Art. 42 and 43 of the GDPR. Section 5 focuses on the open questions and  challenges for the establishment and successful take-up of the certifications, but also for the role of  certifications as a transparency and accountability instrument under the GDPR. Lastly, section 6 concludes  the report with recommendations, drawn based on the lessons learned from the analysis of existing  certification schemes and the analysis of the GDPR provisions. These recommendations are meant to  provide high-level guidance to supervisory authorities, certification bodies, and controllers/processors that  intend to be involved in certification in the field of data protection.  5  Disclaimer: Any views expressed in this report by the members of the expert group only reflect their own views and  analysis and do not necessarily reflect or in any way prejudice the views of organizations they are affiliated with.  Recommendations on European Data Protection Certification  Version 1.0  |  November 2017  09  2. Basic concepts in certification  The General Data Protection Regulation introduces provisions on certification to enhance transparency of  the processing operations of the data controllers and the processors. The legislature also envisaged a role  of certification in assisting controllers and processors to demonstrate compliance with the Regulation6. The  following section outlines the main aspects in existing certification practice7, as applicable to the newly  established data protection certification regime under the GDPR.  Normative basis  Certification is a conformity assessment activity.8 Certification entails “the provision of assessment and  impartial third-party attestation that fulfilment of specified requirements has been demonstrated”9. The  requirements are usually derived from technical standards or legislation. The latter is the case of  certification in the field of data protection, where the secondary EU legislation safeguarding the right to  protection of personal data provides the normative framework as a basis for the assessment requirements.  It is also possible that requirements are embedded in a technical standard, which is inspired by the GDPR  provisions. The GDPR provisions need to be further elaborated to be fit-for-purpose for certification. As  the ISO/IEC 17067:2013 standard provides “where it is necessary to elaborate upon the requirements to  remove ambiguity, the explanations should be formulated by competent people and should be made  available to all interested parties”.  Third-party assessment Vs self-assessment  As its definition makes clear, certification is a third-party conformity assessment activity. The assessment is  performed by a party, other than the organisation that seeks certification (first party) and other than the  entity (if any) requiring the organisation to be certified (second party). In terms of data protection, the first  party assessment would be a data controller or a processor self-assessing its compliance with the GDPR.  This model would resemble a data protection impact assessment, in terms of the actors involved in the  process and the nature of a self-assessment exercise. A second party assessment would take place when a  data controller assesses whether a data processor, with which it collaborates, complies with the General  Data Protection Regulation. In that case, a data controller would be the second party in the assessment  process. Certification however requires assessment by a third independent party, which usually is a  certification body. In the case of the GDPR, as explained in section 3, the third party may be either an  accredited certification body or a Data Protection Authority. It is important to stress that while third-party  assessment leads to certification, self-assessment does not lead to certification. The self-assessor may  issue a self-declaration of conformity, but such a declaration has nothing to do with Art. 42 and 43 GDPR.  6 As set out in GDPR Recital 100 and GDPR Article. 42 paragraph 1  7 For example in the context of well established procedures of certification against international ISO/IEC conformity  assessment standards and other.  8 The ISO/IEC 17000 standard defines conformity assessment as: “demonstration that specified requirements  (relating to a product, process, system, person or body are fulfilled”  9 ISO/IEC 17067:2013  Recommendations on European Data Protection Certification  Version 1.0  |  November 2017  10  Certification scheme  A certification scheme is a document that includes the rules, procedures, and management for carrying out  certification for a specific product, process, or service.10 The owner of a certification scheme may be a  certification body, a public (supervisory) authority (for instance a data protection authority), or a private  actor (which nevertheless is not itself active in the sector targeted by its certification scheme).  Certification requirements, procedural aspects and criteria  Following the non-harmonised terminology in the field of certification, several terms are used to signify  identical concepts. According to the terminology proposed by ISO and IEC, a certification requirement is a  requirement “that is fulfilled by the client as a condition of establishing or maintaining certification”. The  term includes both the substantive requirements (otherwise called ‘product/process/person’  requirements) and procedural requirements. The substantive requirements are derived from the  normative basis. Data subjects’ rights (Arts. 15-22 GDPR), data security (Art. 32 GDPR), data protection by  design (Art. 25 (1) GDPR) and data protection by default (Art. 25(2) GDPR) offer, for instance, a normative  basis that may be further specified in substantive certification requirements. At the same time, procedural  requirements are also part of a certification scheme and necessary to be fulfilled by the party seeking  certification.11 Such procedural requirements would for example specify under which conditions a data  controller may use the acquired certificate, what are surveillance periods, the compensation structure, etc.  Some of the procedural aspects are already clarified by the GDPR – for example the length of certification  validity of 3 years (Art. 42(7)). Some existing certification schemes might use the term ‘criteria’ to signify  the substantive (product/process/person) requirements.12 The GDPR seems to refer to the substantive  requirements as the “criteria” and to procedural requirements as “requirements”.  Certificates, seals and marks  The outcome of a successful certification (process) is a certificate (thus a document), and/or a seal, that  attests that the applicant organisation meets the requirements (substantive and procedural) specified in  the certification scheme, and provided in technical standards or legislation. As the following sections of the  report indicate, there is no uniform approach in practice on the outcome of a successful certification  process. In some cases, there is sector-specific legislation that defines the terms and clarifies their legal  significance. In the context of electronic identification and trust services for electronic transactions, the  Regulation 920/2014 defines ‘electronic seal’ as “data in electronic form, which is attached to or logically  associated with other data in electronic form to ensure the latter’s origin and integrity”13 and a ‘certificate  for electronic seal’ as a “an electronic attestation that links electronic seal validation data to a legal person  and confirms the name of that person”14.  Certification schemes may provide that a successful assessment  leads to a certificate or a seal or both.  In addition, there might also be a mark available for use by the organisation that was granted with  certification. Such a mark or logo is a sign of a successful certification process. The terms ‘mark’,  ‘trademark’ or ‘trustmark’ are sometimes used interchangeably in practice, but ‘trademark’ also bears  10 This generic definition based on the ISO/IEC 17067:2013. The issue of the subject matter of the data protection  certification mechanisms as provided in the GDPR is further discussed in section 5.  11 The ISO/IEC 17065:2012 standard provides examples of such requirements. One example is the payment of fee  from the applicant organisation to the certification body.  12 An example is the EuroPrise certification.  13 Art. 3(25) Regulation 910/2014  14 Art. 3(29) Regulation 910/2014  Recommendations on European Data Protection Certification  Version 1.0  |  November 2017  11  legal significance, as it implies a registered trademark in line with national or regional legislation.15 The role  of the mark is to identify the issuer and the aspects covered by the mark in a clear way.16  Accreditation  According to the Regulation 765/2008 (: Accreditation Regulation) accreditation is “an attestation by a  national accreditation body that a conformity assessment body meets the requirements set by harmonised  standards and, where applicable, any additional requirements including those set out in relevant sectoral  schemes, to carry out a specific conformity assessment activity.” In other words, accreditation aims to  ensure that the certification body, or any other conformity assessment body, has the necessary  competence to carry out its tasks. The assessment in the framework of accreditation is not limited to  independence, capacity, resources, and other requirements, but extends to the subject matter, such as for  instance competence in information security or data protection matters. Each Member State has, in  principle, one National Accreditation Body (NAB) which grants accreditation certificates to conformity  assessment bodies. Even though in general a certification body may operate without being accredited, this  is not the case for the data protection certification mechanisms of the GDPR, as Art. 43 explicitly requires  accreditation of the certification body.  Mandatory Vs voluntary certification  Certification may be mandatory, when a relevant obligation for certification is established in legislation.  Examples of mandatory certification exist in the EU legislation, but are scarce.17 The most common  mandatory mark is the CE marking, which however, is not considered certification, but self-declaration of  conformity. Any entity is free to declare its compliance with the harmonised legislation imposing the  obligation to bear a CE marking, in principle, without an assessment from a third independent body. In the  field of EU data protection, both under the Data Protection Directive 95/46/EC and the GDPR, data  protection certification is voluntary. The voluntary nature of certification relates to the decision of a data  controller or a processor to submit oneself to the certification procedure.18 Furthermore, a controller or  processor may choose other or additional means to demonstrate compliance with its legal obligations  stemming from the GDPR.  Privacy-seals Vs data protection certifications  One last clarification should be made regarding the distinction between privacy-related certifications and  seals on the one hand, and data-protection certifications and seals on the other. Such a distinction follows  the distinction of the right to protection of personal data and the right to respect private and family life,  15 For instance, in line with Art. 27(1) of the Directive (EU) 2015/2436, a certification mark means a “trade mark which  is described as such when the mark is applied for and is capable of distinguishing goods or services which are certified  by the proprietor of the mark in respect of material, mode of manufacture of goods or performance of services,  quality, accuracy or other characteristics, from goods and services which are not so certified”.  16 ISO/IEC 17030:2013  17 Directive 2004/49/EC establishes safety certification granted by a public authority as a mandatory requirement for  a railway undertaking to be granted access to a railway infrastructure.

(2017)  Recommendations on European Data Protection Certification  Version 1.0  |  November 2017  12  home and communications.19 This study is primarily concerned with the GDPR certification, which is data  protection certification.20  19 Read further De Hert P. and S. Gutwirth (2008), Gonzalez-Fuster G. (2014)  20 Despite the focus of the study being data protection certification, the research for the following sections was not  limited to strictly data protection related certifications, which are still limited in number due to the newly introduced  provisions in the EU data protection legislation (Art. 42 and 43 GDPR).  Recommendations on European Data Protection Certification  Version 1.0  |  November 2017  13  3. Main elements of GDPR Articles 42 and 43  The GDPR introduced certification as a means for a data controller or a data processor to demonstrate  compliance of a processing operation with the Regulation. An additional function of certification in the  context of the GDPR is to enhance transparency, since certifications, seals, and marks allow data subjects  to “quickly assess the level of data protection of relevant products and services”.21  Certification as an accountability-based mechanism  Certification is well linked to the newly introduced principle of accountability. As already highlighted by the  Article 29 Data Protection Working Party in 2010, data protection needed additional mechanisms that  translate legal requirements into real data protection measures.22 Certification and seals are treated as  accountability-based mechanisms, due to their potential effect to facilitate scalability, compliance,  transparency, and to some extent legal certainty.  Art. 5(2) GDPR requires the data controller to both comply with the principles relating to the processing of  personal data and demonstrate its compliance. Demonstration of compliance in practice may require  multiple actions, such as proper documentation and record keeping (in line with art. 30 GDPR).  Certification can play a role in that respect; a controller that has had its processing operations successfully  evaluated by a certification body, may use the certification and its supporting documentation as an  element to demonstrate compliance to the supervisory authority. The fact that data protection  certification in the GDPR is an accountability-based mechanism is supported by its voluntary nature.23  Certification of compliance with GDPR provisions  As the GDPR provides in Art. 42 (4), a certification pursuant to this Article does not reduce the  responsibility of the controller or the processor for compliance with this Regulation, meaning that  compliance with the GDPR is not possible to be certified. What can be certified, is compliance with (or else:  conformity to) certification criteria that are derived from the GDPR. Compliance with such criteria entails  that a controller or processor at a certain period in time has taken measures to ensure that it fulfils certain  obligations, for instance to secure personal data in a given processing operation.  In general, where the EU legislature, intends to assign a different effect to certification or self-declaration  of conformity, this is explicitly provided in the legislation. For instance, conformity with harmonised  standards that are developed on the basis of the New Approach Directives, offer a presumption of  conformity with the legislation and this is explicitly provided for in the relevant law. Similarly, the CE  marking offers specific effects in relation to the safety of the products. This is not the case in the GDPR,  which does not assign such legal effects to certifications.  Key actors: Certification bodies and Supervisory authorities  The data protection mechanisms as proposed in Art. 42 and 43 GDPR involve mainly the following actors:   The data controller or data processor that aims to apply for certification (‘applicant’)   The certification body   The supervisory authority (data protection authority)  21 Recital 100 GDPR.  22 WP29 (2010), Opinion 3/2010 on the principle of accountability, WP173.  23 Art. 42 (3) GDPR.  Recommendations on European Data Protection Certification  Version 1.0  |  November 2017  14   The European Data Protection Board (EDPB)  The certification bodies and the supervisory authorities are key actors in the certification process.  Certification may be conducted by either a certification body that fulfils the conditions of art. 43 GDPR, or  by a supervisory authority. The GDPR does not determine when the process is conducted by a certification  body and when by a supervisory authority. This legal gap appears to be intentional: Member States and  national supervisory authorities may organise certification at a national level according to their preferred  model. However, we should note the inherent risk to the possibility of cross-border recognition of the  certifications that lies with the adoption of diverse models across Member States, as discussed later in  section 5.  After the evaluation phase, in the case that the applicant fulfils the necessary requirements, certification is  granted by the certification body or the supervisory authority. Certification is issued for three years, and  may be renewed. It is important to mention that even when the certification body issues the certification,  the supervisory authority has several powers, such as to withdraw the certification or order the  certification body to withdraw the certification.24  The supervisory authorities also have the power to approve criteria for certification. Not every certification  in the field of data protection is automatically a data protection certification mechanism as provided in the  GDPR. The national supervisory authority needs to formally approve the certification criteria. Such  approval may constitute an administrative act, with legal effects.25  The European Data Protection Board (EDPB) takes the role of the national supervisory authorities, as  outlined above, in the case of a European Data Protection Seal. The European Data Protection Seal is a  common EU-wide certification, the criteria of which, are approved not by one or more national data  protection authorities, but by the European Data Protection Board.  Scope of certification under GDPR  As highlighted, not every certification in the field of data protection is automatically a data protection  certification mechanism as provided in the GDPR. In fact, the GDPR appears to be quite limiting when  providing the scope of processing activities where data controllers and processors can use certification as  an element to show compliance. The scope is mainly limited by the following conditions:  1. Purpose of certification  According to Article 42 of GDPR, “The Member States, the supervisory authorities, the Board and the  Commission shall encourage, in particular at Union level, the establishment of data protection  certification mechanisms and of data protection seals and marks, for the purpose of demonstrating  compliance with this Regulation of processing operations by controllers and processors”. The purpose of  a data protection certification mechanism under GDPR is thus demonstrating compliance with the  Regulation of processing operations by controllers and processors, which clarifies that the substantive  requirements a client must fulfil must be related to the provisions of the GDPR, for example to  demonstrate compliance with the provision on data security (Art. 32). If a certification mechanism  involves a scope that is not in the scope of the GDPR, for example a data protection education course,  24 Art. 42(7) GDPR.  25 Data Protection Authorities are independent authorities of public (administrative) law. It follows therefore, that the  decision of the Data Protection Authority approving or rejecting criteria for certification may be challenged before  national administrative courts.  Recommendations on European Data Protection Certification  Version 1.0  |  November 2017  15  such a mechanism cannot be used to demonstrate compliance with the GDPR. Such a certification  mechanism would therefore not be in the scope of Art. 42 and 43 GDPR data protection certification  mechanisms. Nevertheless, such certification may exist in the free market and potentially contribute to  raising the levels of data protection awareness.  2. Processing operation  The object of certification must be a processing operation. The GDPR regulates the processing of  personal data, which may be conducted in the context of a product or system or a service. However, the  wording of Art. 42(1) requires that a certification mechanism under GDPR must concern an activity of  data processing. Such an activity may be (also an integral) part of a product, a system, or service, but the  certification must be granted in relation to the processing activit(ies), and not to the product, system or  service as such (e. g. certification of data deletion process in product X).  3. Controllers or processors  The reference to “by controllers or processors” limits the scope of applicants that can opt for  certification under the GDPR to controllers and processors. Producers or manufacturers of products,  systems and services, if they do not process any personal data, as controllers or processors, are not in  the scope of the GDPR certification mechanisms.26  Nevertheless, there might be certifications in the market, aimed at manufacturers (e.g. OS providers and  mobile device manufacturers), in relation to data protection-friendly configuration of products or  systems, which will undoubtedly contribute to raise the level of data protection. However, they will be  outside of the scope of the GDPR data protection certification mechanisms of Art. 42 and 43 GDPR  Accreditation of certification bodies  A substantial part of the GDPR provisions on certification refers to accreditation. The legislature  emphasises the importance of having reliable, competent, and independent bodies carrying out the  certification by devoting Art. 43 GDPR to certification bodies. Art. 43 GDPR requires the certification bodies  that provide data protection certifications to be accredited. The GDPR allows the Member States to select  the accreditation model they will follow, from a selection of three options:  a. accreditation by a Data Protection Authority (or the European Data Protection Board, in the case of the  European Data Protection Seal)27,  b. accreditation by the National Accreditation Body on the basis of the Accreditation Regulation and the  ISO/IEC 17065:2012 standard and additional requirements in the field of data protection provided by  the Data Protection Authority, or  c. both authorities, namely the National Accreditation Body and the competent Data Protection  Authority, collaborating in this task.  26 The provision of Art 42(7) GDPR reiterates the position: “Certification shall be issued to a controller or processor for  a maximum period (..)”  27 Art. 70 (1) (o) GDPR.  Recommendations on European Data Protection Certification  Version 1.0  |  November 2017  16  4. Existing data protection-related certification schemes  In this section, the existing certification landscape in the EU and outside the EU is reviewed, with the aim  of drawing experience already available in the market. Previous research has identified and analysed  several certifications, which have in a broad sense a focus on privacy, data protection and data security.28  The findings suggested that only a small number of EU schemes can be said to relate to the Data  Protection Directive 95/46/EC or the GDPR. Transparency of the certification process, criteria, and  assessment methodology has also been identified as a problematic area.29  Parameters of analysis  To further build on that foundation, the present study focuses on a limited number of existing  certifications that have been identified as the most relevant for discussion in relation to the GDPR  provisions, due to i) their focus on privacy and data protection, ii) requirements based on the EU data  protection legislation or relevant international standards, iii) organisational structure and iv) maturity in  the market. Selected existing certification schemes are presented, analysed according to a number of key  parameters, mainly corresponding to open issues, challenges and opportunities of certification under the  GDPR.  The analysis does not aim to be exhaustive, but to provide a grasp of the current landscape and offer  insights for the GDPR certification. The parameters are summarized below:   Subject matter and scope of certification is concerned with how existing schemes define their scope  and identify what can be certified according to their requirements – whether it is only the data  processing activities that can be certified or the entire products, services or systems. The aim of  certification is also of interest in this regard.   Normative basis. This parameter refers to the normative basis of the analysed certifications.  Subsequently, it is important to identify how the criteria are formulated and to what extent the  certifications offer assurance of compliance with the GDPR or assure that a controller or a processor  “has measures in place to comply with legislation/standard.   Certification process of the analysed certifications is examined, including the roles of involved  stakeholders, the role of the certification body in terms of its independence, the stages of the  certification process, how information is exchanged, the measures that need to be implemented by  the applicant, how the certificate is granted and under which conditions. The GDPR does not instruct  specifically on the process of certification, hence the aim of analysis is to identify the stages of the  certification processes.   Duration of the certification process, post-certification surveillance of issued certifications, validity  period of certification are described, where available, in search of current practices that could inform  future decisions regarding these topics, that are not generally specifically provided for by the GDPR  (except for the length of validity of the certificate).   Accreditation of the certification bodies. The GDPR requires that only certification bodies that are  accredited may grant certifications, and provides for several options of accreditation, either by the  28 Rodrigues R. et. al, 2013 , ENISA, 2013  29 Rodrigues R. et. al, 2013  Recommendations on European Data Protection Certification  Version 1.0  |  November 2017  17  DPA or the national Accreditation body.30 Hence it is important to look at the existing certification  landscape from this aspect.31  Bellow the results of the analysis are presented in relation to the above identified criteria. The analysed  certifications are the following:   ePrivacyseal EU   EuroPrise   CNIL Labels   ICO Privacy Seal (under development)   Certification based ON ISO/IEC 27001   Certification based on ISO/IEC 27018   PrivacyMark system   Privacy by Design by Ryerson University and Deloitte Canada  Subject matter and scope of certifications  The analysis of the scope and subject matter of the existing certifications revealed variations in the existing  practices. Several certifications target products and services, others processes, and others management  systems. Certifications based on the management standards, such as the ISO/IEC 27001 may target a single  business process (e.g. in human resources), a particular service or the whole business process of an  organization. Similarly, the Privacy Mark System (from Japan) focuses on the assessment of a Personal  Information Protection Management System (PMS). The aim of the assessment is to determine whether  the applicant organization manages adequately risks on handling personal information. There are also  certifications such as EuroPrise, which focus on the processing operations performed within a service or by  a product. Within the scope of the EuroPrise certification are IT products such as hardware and software,  IT based services and automated processing of data.  The CNIL privacy seals offer a variety of scopes, which range from governance, products (digital safe  boxes), procedures (audit procedures covering the processing of personal data) to courses (data protection  training courses). Regarding services that are provided by more than one service providers, CNIL provides a  “joint privacy seal”.32 The certifications based on the ISO/IEC 27018 standard target processes that relate  to the processing of Personally Identifiable Information (PII) for providers of public cloud services.  Certifications targeting governance aspects and the management systems are different from certifications  targeting processing (processing as such or processing as part of a service or a product). Certifications on  management and governance issues are more “process-oriented” than “goal-oriented”. The auditor in the  ISO/IEC 27001 certification will ask the applicant whether for instance a Data Retention Policy is in place.  On the other hand, a “goal-oriented” certification is not focusing primarily on the measures taken, but  whether the measures are sufficient to fulfil certain pre-determined goals. The “goal-oriented”  certification therefore focuses more on qualitative elements. To return to the previous example, the  30 See section on ‘Error! Reference source not found.’  31 In the Annex of the Report there is an additional parameter is considered on Resources needed to obtain  certification, in terms of fees as well as organisational resources. The GDPR points to the usefulness of certification  schemes for smaller organizations and companies, hence it will be considered whether a lightweight version of the  scheme already exists among the analysed certifications. The number of issued certificates, where available, is  included in the overview.  32 https://www.cnil.fr/fr/node/682  https://www.cnil.fr/fr/node/682  Recommendations on European Data Protection Certification  Version 1.0  |  November 2017  18  auditor would not only examine whether there is a Data Retention Policy in place, but also whether the  Policy addresses issues that need to be covered by such a policy in the specific organization etc. Such  different approaches have an impact on the effort and the resources the applicant needs to invest, but  also the level of assurance they offer. The data protection mechanisms of Art. 42 and 43 can be  characterised as goal-oriented certifications, as the focus should not be only on whether measures are in  place, but also to what extent such measures are sufficient.  Normative basis and compliance with the legislation  The analysed certifications are based on either the legislation or the technical standards. The ePrivacyseal  derives its criteria from what it refers to as “applicable EU Data Protection Directives” and the GDPR.  Additionally, there is a set of criteria related to Online Behavioural Advertising. The criteria refer to  grounds for processing, data protection principles, and subjects’ rights. EuroPrise certification is based on  the Directive 95/46/EC (and the GDPR) and the ePrivacy Directive.33 The PrivacyMark is based on a  Japanese standard, the requirements of which relate to personal information protection policy,  specification of personal information, relevant legislation, implementation and operation, documentation,  complaints mechanisms, inspections, and preventive actions.  The Privacy by Design certification is neither based on legislation nor a technical standard, but the  Framework of 7 Foundational Principles for Privacy by Design.34  On the topic of the assurance in relation to compliance with the legislation, there can be three main  approaches that are listed below.  4.3.1 Certifications that are independent from legislation  Such are the certifications based on the ISO/IEC standards or other normative documents, such as the  Privacy by Design Principles framework. The Privacy by Design certification provided by Ryerson University  and Deloitte Canada does not signify compliance with the Ontario privacy laws. The ISO/IEC 27018  standard for instance states that it “establishes commonly accepted control objectives, controls and  guidelines for implementing measures to protect Personally Identifiable Information (PII) in accordance  with the privacy principles in ISO/IEC 29100 for the public cloud computing environment”35 These  certifications also do not use legislation as the normative source, but instead use other technical  standards. They may take into account existing legislation, in the sense for instance that the requirements  in the standard may not contradict the legal obligations. However, no direct references to the law are  made.  4.3.2 Certifications that use the legislation as a source for their substantive criteria  The ePrivacyseal EU claims that it attests a product’s “compliance with the list of ePrivacyseal EU criteria,  which reflects the requirements imposed by EU data protection legislation.”36 In that sense, such  certifications do not directly promise to offer compliance with the data protection legislation. They use  33 Directive 2002/58/EC, amended in 2009.  34 By Ann Cavoukian https://www.ipc.on.ca/wp-content/uploads/Resources/7foundationalprinciples.pdf  35 ISO/IEC 27018:2014 “Information technology - Security techniques - Code of practice for protection of personally  identifiable information (PII) in public clouds acting as PII processors”, section 1 (“Scope”)  36 ePrivacyseal EU website: https://www.eprivacy.eu/en/privacy-seals/eprivacyseal/  https://www.ipc.on.ca/wp-content/uploads/Resources/7foundationalprinciples.pdf https://www.eprivacy.eu/en/privacy-seals/eprivacyseal/  Recommendations on European Data Protection Certification  Version 1.0  |  November 2017  19  however the legislation as their normative framework. The criteria for each certification reviewed are  provided as part of Annex A.  4.3.3 Certifications that provide assurance of compliance with the legislation  An example is the CNIL case. The aim of the CNIL privacy seals is to provide a recognition from the French  Data Protection Authority to the applicant that its product, course, procedure “corresponds to the  requirements of the Data Protection Authority” (“confidence indicator”).37  Another example in this stream  is EuroPrise.38  It should be noted that attestation provided by a data protection authority, should not be misinterpreted  as assurance of compliance with the legislation, provided by the authority, in its supervisory role. In view  of avoiding such implications, the CNIL provides a clarification that the CNIL Privacy Seals do not aim to  exempt its holders from administrative fines.39 A different approach was proposed by ICO. ICO announced  in 2015 its plans to introduce a national privacy seal. The aim was to deliver a stamp that an organization  “demonstrates good practice and high data protection compliance standards.” What was interesting about  the announced ICO privacy seals, is that the seal would not only demonstrate compliance with the  requirements of the UK Data Protection Act, but would also show that the certified organization surpasses  the legal requirements and went “above and beyond the call of duty”.40  Certification process  The certification processes of the analysed certifications follow similar, but not identical approaches. The  models usually include:  1. a stage of application and first assessment of the application,  2. evaluation by expert auditors/assessors which leads to an evaluation report,  3. the decision (by person(s) other than the auditor(s)),  4. granting of certification and  5. possibility for re-certification  The exact models and expertise of the certification procedures provide useful examples and good  practices. EuroPrise collaborates with legal and technical experts, which are admitted as experts by  EuroPrise.41 The EuroPrise experts evaluate the product or service and report their findings in an  evaluation report. The Certification Authority (EuroPrise) checks the evaluation report with respect to  completeness, plausibility, and comparability with other certifications. It then drafts an internal  certification report, awards the seal, and publishes a short report. The CNIL employs a Labelling  Committee, at the evaluation stage, which performs the legal analysis, develops recommendations and  plans for corrective actions. The decision is made by the Data Protection Authority in its plenary meeting.  The granting of the CNIL Privacy Seal is published on the website of CNIL and the Official Journal  (Legifrance). The ePrivacyseal includes a workshop in a preparatory stage before the actual evaluation.  37 https://www.cnil.fr/fr/node/682  38 EuroPrise website for instance provides: “We certify the privacy compliance of IT products and IT-based services  with European data protection regulations” https://www.european-privacy-seal.eu/EPS-en/About-EuroPriSe  39 CNIL provides: “The privacy seal informs the public that the procedure or product proposed corresponds to the  requirements of the Data Protection Authority. In this, it plays the role of a confidence indicator. It does not aim to  exempt its holders from administrative formalities.” https://www.cnil.fr/fr/questions-reponses-sur-les-labels-cnil  40 See ICO blog 28 January 2015 https://iconewsblog.org.uk/2015/01/28/what-you-need-to-know-about-ico-privacy- seals/  41 See website of EuroPrise: https://www.european-privacy-seal.eu/EPS-en/Expert-admission  https://www.cnil.fr/fr/node/682 https://www.european-privacy-seal.eu/EPS-en/About-EuroPriSe https://www.cnil.fr/fr/questions-reponses-sur-les-labels-cnil https://iconewsblog.org.uk/2015/01/28/what-you-need-to-know-about-ico-privacy-seals/ https://iconewsblog.org.uk/2015/01/28/what-you-need-to-know-about-ico-privacy-seals/ https://www.european-privacy-seal.eu/EPS-en/Expert-admission  Recommendations on European Data Protection Certification  Version 1.0  |  November 2017  20  During the workshop, legal and technical experts examine the product or service based on the relevant  technical, organizational, and legal requirements.  The Privacy by Design certification has its evaluation and decision phases performed by different  organisations. Deloitte is responsible for scrutinizing the product or service and issuing a report, while the  Privacy by Design Centre of Excellence of the Ryerson University issues a decision on granting the  certification. This is a best practice as it provides guarantees for independence of the actors involved in  each stage. The well-established Privacymark system collaborates with over one thousand assessors,  assessment and training bodies. The assessment of conformity with the standard has two stages, namely  the assessment of the documentation and on-site assessment.  The duration of the certification process is usually not specified. This shortcoming may be attributed to the  diversity of the applications, the size of the organisations, ranging from large industry with complex  systems to SMEs, and varying risk in the operations and systems of the applicants.  With regard to the possibilities of an applicant to challenge the decision of the certification body or  authority to grant the certification, there should be a distinction between internal dispute resolution  mechanisms and judicial review. EuroPrise for instance has a dispute resolution mechanism in place.42 CNIL  on the other hand, does not have such processes in place. However, this does not mean that a rejection  decision by CNIL cannot be challenged. The decisions of supervisory authorities are subject to  administrative law judicial review but for specific grounds, foreseen in national administrative law. The  decision of CNIL to reject an application for certification may therefore be appealed to the Conseil d’Etat  within two months from the publication of the decision.43 This situation is different than the certifications  issued by private organisations. Such organisations might have a dispute resolution mechanism, as  mentioned above, but their decisions can be subject to judicial review by civil law courts (in civil law  juridictions), instead of administrative courts. The legal grounds may potentially be derived from contract  law, due process issues, and competition law issues.  Post-certification stage and monitoring of granted certifications  With regard to the post-certification stage, the analysed certifications follow different practices. In most of  the cases, there is a follow-up after granting the certification. CNIL reserves the right to perform checks at  any time and by any means that the certified product or procedure complies with the conditions of  certification. If such conditions are no longer met, CNIL may withdraw the granted privacy seal (and  certification).  A different model is followed by the Ryerson Privacy by Design certification. The certification  is valid for three years, but each organization needs to renew on an annual basis the certification. The  renewal requires an attestation from the organization that there has not been any change affecting the  granted certification and the payment of a renewal fee. Certifications based on ISO/IEC standards may  include a post-certification surveillance stage, when following the ISO/IEC conformity assessment  standards. According to the ISO/IEC 17065 standard, surveillance44 is necessary for continuing use of a  certification mark which is authorized for placement on a certified product, process or service.  Accreditation  The analysed certifications do not follow common approaches. The ICO seal, which is under development,  follows an approach close to the GDPR accreditation model: the certification body that will be granting the  42 https://www.european-privacy-seal.eu/EPS-en/Dispute-Resolution  43 https://www.cnil.fr/en/all-you-should-know-about-privacy-seals  44 “Surveillance” is defined as “systematic iteration of conformity assessment activities as a basis for maintaining the  validity of the statement of conformity” ISO/IEC 17000 standard.  Recommendations on European Data Protection Certification  Version 1.0  |  November 2017  21  ICO Privacy Seal has to be accredited by the National Accreditation Body (UKAS45) and meet additional  criteria established by the Data Protection Authority. CNIL, grants the seals and has not outsourced this  activity. CNIL is not accredited. The PrivacyMark system, EuroPrise and ePrivacy are not using accredited  certification bodies by the National Accreditation Bodies. Instead, they have a system of training or  accepting trained experts and auditors. The certifications based on the ISO/IEC standards on the other  hand are often granted by accredited National Certification Bodies.  45See website of the UK National Accreditation Body  www.ukas.com  http://www.ukas.com/  Recommendations on European Data Protection Certification  Version 1.0  |  November 2017  22  5. Data Protection Certification: Challenges and open questions  The following section focuses on several challenges that data protection certification under GDPR is likely  to face. Some challenges stem from the GDPR provisions itself, which are only to some extent in harmony  with existing (more mature) frameworks in certification and accreditation in other fields, close to the field  of data protection (cybersecurity, eIDAS Regulation, etc.), while others are a consequence of (national and  international) diversity of the privacy and data protection certifications, that already exist in the market.  Terminology  The meaning of some terms used in GDPR is unclear, among them the term “criteria”. In the certification  context in other sectors the term “requirement” is regularly used to signify the specific levels of service or  contents that have to be fulfilled by an applicant, whereas the term “criteria” is not defined unitedly.  In  some certifications, as highlighted in Chapter 2, the term criteria is used to signify substantive  requirements. The same goes for certification mechanisms/seals/mark, which the GDPR uses collectively,  without differentiating among the legal concepts.  It is important to note, that although certification has not been formally recognized by legislation in the  data protection field before GDPR, certification as a process is already operational in other areas and  sectors – such as security, safety, etc. It is thus important not to reinvent the vocabulary for certification in  data protection that would differ from other areas in general terms, to avoid confusion on the part of  actors already providing certification or actors taking part in standard setting community that might be  also involved in data protection certification and standard setting. The same argument is applicable to  procedures normally known and respected in certification landscape, to which data protection certification  would preferably align.  Subject matter of certification: processing operations  One significant issue relates to the aim and scope of the data protection certifications in line with Art. 42  and 43 GDPR. Approved certifications are mentioned in several provisions such as the data security (Art.  32) and data protection by design and by default (Art. 25).  The ISO/IEC conformity assessment standards  commonly refer to certification of products, services, process and persons.46 There are schemes available  on the market, already offering certification in such cases,47 especially in relation to products and systems  that are intertwined with data processing operations, such as different software used for data processing  or hardware and appliances that are essentially used for data processing activities. However, the wording  of GDPR, as shown in the Annex, is limiting in this regard as it only recognizes certification of processing  operations and not products or services as such. Additionally, it aims at controllers or processors who  might use the products or services designed for their data processing, and not the manufacturers or  produces of these products and services. Any data processing operation needs to be put in context to be  able to assess the data controllers’ or processor’s compliance with data protection rules (e. g. an online  booking system used in healthcare, processing sensitive data has different implications for the user than if  the same booking system was used in marketing, not processing sensitive data). Nonetheless, certification  of products and services, which enable compliant data processing operations of data controllers and  processors, may contribute to raising awareness and offering transparency on the activities of the  controller/processor, or the qualities of a product.  46 ISO/IEC 17065:2012, ISO/IEC 17021-1:2015, ISO/IEC 17024:2012  47 See Annex of the Report  Recommendations on European Data Protection Certification  Version 1.0  |  November 2017  23  Diversity in accreditation models  The GDPR leaves room for manoeuvre for the Member States to decide the accreditation model. The  challenges are linked to the resources the DPAs possess in relation to accreditation following ISO/IEC  17065:2012, if the Data Protection Authorities are to be accrediting by themselves, as well as the resources  and knowledge of accreditation bodies in additional data protection criteria. In practice cooperation  between the two authorities seems a viable solution, however procedures of cooperation need to be  specified and the additional data protection criteria harmonized across EU Member States.  Approval of criteria for certification by Data Protection Authorities and/or EDPB  The GDPR provides that the DPAs and/or the EDPB have the authority to approve criteria for certification.  However, the GDPR does not provide further guidance on benchmarks for the approval of the criteria by  the data protection authorities. Consistency is of utmost importance to ensure same level of quality of the  different data protection certifications.  It is important to arrive at common interpretations regarding approval of certification criteria that are  based on conformity against widely recognized international standards, such as the ISO standards. It is  important to clearly set the roles of EDPB and national DPAs in this regard and also to recognize the  importance of such international standards and their integration in the certification under GDPR. The role  of the Commission in regulating with implementing acts should also be taken into account. It needs to be  clarified who should seek approval of criteria.  EU level vs. national certifications: risks of proliferation of national certifications  As recognized by the GDPR and in other fields of certification, such as security,48 harmonization of  approaches to certification across the EU is a goal to be pursued, due to challenges, posed by proliferation  of nationally focused certifications49. Complex issues of mutual recognition arise in case of different  national approaches, in addition to transparency issues and, especially from the consumer side, lack of  recognition and trust in a potentially large number of seals offering different kinds and levels of protection  of their personal data, in the context of the single market. The GDPR specifically instructs the Member  States, Data protection authorities, the EDPB and the Commission to encourage, in particular at Union  level, the establishment of data protection certification mechanisms and of data protection seals and  marks. However, keeping the focus on harmonized approaches that could be valid throughout the EU  Member States will most likely be challenging; currently many certifications exist in Member States50, as  shown in section 2, most of them not being harmonized neither in terms of procedures nor requirements.  The emergence or recognition of certifications at the EU level will therefore need strong initiative from the  EDPB and/or the European Commission.  On the downside of single EU wide certification approaches, endorsed or developed by authorities, market  initiatives in development of very specialized certifications for specific, or even niche processing  48 Wurster S, et al. Consolidated report on security standards, certification and accreditation – best practice and  lessons learnt: Deliverable 2.2 for the CRISP project. CRISP project, 2015  49 As recognized also in the Discussion paper of Centre for Information Policy Leadership, on the role of certification  mechanisms under GDPR, highlighting the value propositions of the industry, data controllers and processors,  available at: https://www.huntonprivacyblog.com/wp- content/uploads/sites/18/2017/04/cipl_gdpr_certifications_discussion_paper_12_april_2017.pdf  50 In Germany alone more than 40 certifications in the data protection field exist; and updated list from February  2017 is available at: https://stiftungdatenschutz.org/fileadmin/Redaktion/PDF/Zertifizierungsuebersicht/SDS- Zertifizierungsuebersicht_02_2017.pdf.  https://www.huntonprivacyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/18/2017/04/cipl_gdpr_certifications_discussion_paper_12_april_2017.pdf https://www.huntonprivacyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/18/2017/04/cipl_gdpr_certifications_discussion_paper_12_april_2017.pdf https://stiftungdatenschutz.org/fileadmin/Redaktion/PDF/Zertifizierungsuebersicht/SDS-Zertifizierungsuebersicht_02_2017.pdf https://stiftungdatenschutz.org/fileadmin/Redaktion/PDF/Zertifizierungsuebersicht/SDS-Zertifizierungsuebersicht_02_2017.pdf  Recommendations on European Data Protection Certification  Version 1.0  |  November 2017  24  operations, may hamper the development of specific certifications targeting niche sectors. Mutual  recognition of such certifications across the EU should be an impetus in such cases.  Under the GDPR, the DPAs and the EDPB both have the task to approve certification criteria, submitted to  them by providers of data protection certification mechanisms, which may result in conflicting decisions.  That may be in the case of cross border providers of certifications, which might have gained approval of  their criteria in one Member State, but have been confronted with a negative decision by the EDPB or  another Member State. To ensure legal certainty these procedures will have to be streamlined and mutual  recognition issues considered also in the relation DPAs – EDPB.  Since many different forms of certifications under the GDPR may coexist, namely national, EU wide,  offered by public and private bodies, there is a risk of confusion on the market, and hence low trust in the  seals.51 The GDPR provides in Art. 42(8) that the EDPB shall collate all certification mechanisms and data  protection seals and marks in a register and shall make them publicly available by any appropriate means.  It is not clear however whether this only refers to the certification mechanisms approved by the EDPB  (with EU wide notion) or also to the national approved certification mechanisms.  Since under GDPR DPAs  will have to be informed about each issued or withdrawn certification, it would be beneficial, in terms of  transparency, trust, and mutual recognition issues, that the above register maintained by the EDPB would  include all approved certification mechanisms, either national or EU recognized.  Cross-border recognition of national certifications  The existence and prioritization of an open EU single market and the fact that many services (especially on  the internet) are cross border in nature, raises many important challenges of mutual recognition of the  certifications under the GDPR. For certification to be an efficient tool in aiding compliance with data  protection rules, it needs, among other conditions, to be recognized as beneficial by data controllers and  processors. The benefits may include showing accountability and demonstrating compliance, as well as the  effect of certification on graduation of sanctions and corporate liability 52.  a. Cross-border recognition of national certifications  Mutual recognition of certifications issued by authorities or certification bodies in different Member States  and possibly also by the EDPB is one of the crucial questions of added value of a certification to a data  controller or processor operating cross border. The challenges for mutual recognition of certifications are  linked to the:   Lack of harmonization of procedures and requirements in existing data protection certification  landscape which is likely to continue, as the GDPR allows many different forms of certification  formats to (co)exist.  This might be beneficial in terms of considering specific interests of sectors at  the level of Member States, however for cross border service providers lack of harmonization of  requirements and procedures is a direct obstacle in the motivation to invest in acquiring different  certifications in different Member States that are not mutually recognized.   Additionally, there will be challenges for DPAs, being faced with certifications data controllers and  processors have acquired in other Member States.  51 This can to some extent be observed from the US experience with seals where it is hard for an individual to assess  which certifications indeed have value in good protection of privacy (Rodrigues R. 2013)  52 Tomšič A, Burnik J, et al. Consolidated report on enhancing confidence and acceptability of new certification  measures. Deliverable D7.1 for the CRISP project. CRISP project, 2017. 19 p.  Recommendations on European Data Protection Certification  Version 1.0  |  November 2017  25  DPAs also have the authority to approve certification criteria. However, their procedures of approval are  likely to differ, which also means the results of their approval might differ in different Member States,  from, for example, a certification body, operating cross border, seeking approval of its certification criteria.  b. Recognition of certifications from outside the EU and certifications against international standards  Many data protection certification schemes currently exist outside the EU, and it is to be expected that the  issuers will either seek formal approval of their certification criteria from EU DPAs or that data controllers  from outside the EU that are conducting business in the EU will be looking for assurances based on their  certification acquired outside the EU. In such cases the same arguments of mutual recognition and  harmonization of such possible recognitions can be applied as above. It would be beneficial if decisions of  EU bodies regarding such foreign certifications were aligned and that they have the resources to be able to  arrive at such non-conflicting decisions (procedural guidelines, ways of informing each other, of  cooperating in procedures of recognitions and possible approvals).  Function creep of DPAs when acting as certification body/body approving criteria,  and supervisory authority  The GDPR allows different models of certification processes to (co)exist across Member States, also in  terms of the body issuing certification. Although there are many benefits of certification relevant for the  DPAs acting in their capacity as supervisory authorities (such as endorsement of compliance by soft  approaches, facilitation of inspection supervisions in cases where certification documentation is a  trustworthy demonstration of data controllers’ accountability and compliance), there are also challenges  to be avoided in case the DPAs opt for such a dual role. If the supervisory body both assesses conformity of  the applicant against requirements based on the GDPR and issues certification, while at the same being  entrusted with the power of supervision over the same processing operations of the data controller or  processor, challenges related to a conflict of interest arise. Even more so, if certification is provided for a  fee and the DPA is the beneficiary of the revenues from certification. If such a dual role is assumed by the  DPA, measures need to be put in place to mitigate risks of potential function creep. As all available models  come with specific challenges and advantages, depending also on the specificities of each Member State,  there cannot be, at least for now, a most or least preferable model.  Recommendations on European Data Protection Certification  Version 1.0  |  November 2017  26  6. Recommendations  The last part of this report outlines recommendations for development of the European data protection  certification under GDPR that would contribute to compliance and fulfil the aims of transparency and  accountability. The recommendations are relevant for the European Commision, the European Data  Protection Board (EDPB) and the supervisory authorities who are in position to develop common and  harmonized understanding of GDPR data protection certification mechanisms and provide further  guidelines and clarifications where open questions and challenges arise, as well as to the organizations  who are interested in issuing certifications or seeking certifications.  Common approach on GDPR data protection certification mechanisms  Due to the issues related to (non-existent) certification terminology in the text of the GDPR, but also issues  that might arise from the adoption of diverse accreditation models and certification processes, it is crucial  that the national supervisory authorities adopt a common approach. Such common approach and  understanding should be extended to all relevant issues of scope, aim, and criteria of the data protection  certification mechanisms under GDPR. This novel endeavour of certification stemming from secondary  data protection legislation should learn from examples in other fields, where such certifications are already  operational, but also successful existing certifications. Such an exercise based on existing knowledge can  function as a useful basis for the development of certifications in the field, to the extent permitted by the  conditions and requirements of the GDPR.  A common approach should also be adopted in relation to the criteria that are being approved by DPAs  and EDPB, most importantly regarding their level of detail and whether they are assessed directly against  GDPR or against a more developed list of broader criteria, developed on the basis of GDPR53. It is  important to deploy an aligned approach on whether the criteria only relate to the substantive  requirements based on GDPR or also to procedural requirements of a certification mechanism (or scheme),  such as the surveillance periods, the condition for granting the seal, etc.  The data subjects need to know whether a certification mechanism is approved in line with Art. 42 and 43  GPDR. For the certifications which are out of the scope of the GDPR certification provisions, any added  value to the contribution of raising awareness on data protection overall should be highlighted.  There should be procedures in place to aid data controllers and DPAs in cases that certifications issued in  one EU Member State are used in another Member State. Mechanisms to help could relate to provision of  information and documentation, but also mutual recognition. An example is a common register of all  issued/withdrawn certification mechanisms, and if possible certifications as well,  in all EU Member States  and development of guidelines as to the procedures that should be followed in mutual recognition  procedures.  National certification bodies and supervisory authorities (DPAs), under the guidance and support of  the European Commission and the European Data Protection Board (EDPB), should pursue a common  approach on inception and deployment of GDPR data protection certification mechanisms.  53 Such broad criteria and more specific requirements, developed on the basis of GDPR, are specified in a CEN  Workshop Agreement no.  17147:2017  , stemming form the foundations of EU co-funded project CRISP. Available:  https://www.nen.nl/NEN-Shop/Norm/CWA-171472017-en.htm  Recommendations on European Data Protection Certification  Version 1.0  |  November 2017  27  Guidance regarding open questions to ensure consistency  As the report highlights, there are several open questions, where guidance would be beneficial. Further  guidance is also in the interest of harmonization and with the look to future developments in the area of  privacy and data protection. The following topics would benefit from further guidance:  1) The procedures for mutual recognition of national certifications by the Data Protection Authorities  2) Compatibility of certifications based on international standards (such as ISO/IEC) and non-EU  certifications with GDPR  3) With regard to the Register with issued certifications to be kept by the EDBP:  a) Does it refer only to EDPB approved certification mechanisms, or to nationally approve as well?  b) Is it open to public?  c) Does it refer to certification mechanisms alone or to all issued certifications?  4) Accreditation models and procedures to avoid conflict of interests and ensure consistency with  Regulation 765/2008.  5) In relation to the criteria for certification, approved by DPAs and EDPB, guidance is necessary on:  a) What are the procedures for approval and how consistency can be ensured?  b) Are the criteria approved directly against GDPR provisions or against a list of broader criteria  specifying the GDPR provisions that may be developed by the authorities?  6) Common guidelines should be developed on the procedures that the DPA, as well as the EDBP, are to  follow in approval of certification criteria in order to achieve harmonization and avoid mutual  recognition issues.  7) Post-certification surveillance measures.  8) Transparency thresholds and complaints mechanisms.  National certification bodies and supervisory authorities (DPAs), with the support of the European  Data Protection Board (EDPB) and the European Commission, should provide guidance and promote  best practises to ensure consistency and harmonization in the deployment of GDPR data protection  certification mechanisms.  Safeguards to avoid function creep  The GDPR allows for different models of engagement of Data Protection Authorities in the processes of  accreditation and certification. In order to avoid function creep. It is recommended that a Data Protection  Authority does not function as the sole accreditation and certification body.  Additionally, in the case that a Data Protection Authority performs all the stages of certification, without  the involvement of a certification body, safeguards for mitigation of the risk of conflict of interest with its  supervisory capacity, should be put in place. Such measures may include separation of the staff conducting  certification from the staff conducting supervisory activities, resolution of the issue of monetary  compensation to the supervisory authority.  Recommendations on European Data Protection Certification  Version 1.0  |  November 2017  28  The European Commission and the European Data Protection Board (EDPB) should stimulate the  establishment of safeguards that will ensure trustworthiness of the certification process.  Approval of high-quality and transparent certifications with sufficient guarantees  As diverse certifications already exist on the market it is to be expected that this trend is likely to continue.  In this regard promotion of quality schemes is recommended in order not allow for the market to be  flooded with untrustworthy certifications. Simplicity, openness and transparency54 are among the most  important signs of quality of a certification mechanism that should include:   Transparent procedures and transparency regarding scheme fees   Publicly accessible summary reports on certifications, and   Publicity of criteria, requirements and methods for evaluation.   On spot audits in combination to documentation reviews   Regular post-certification surveillance and updates of certifications, when necessary   Transparent complaints mechanism   Auditors’ competences.  The European Commission and the European Data Protection Board (EDPB) should stimulate the  establishment of safeguards that will ensure transparency of the certification process.  Promotion of an EU approach  As recognized in other fields of certification, such as security,55 harmonization of approaches to  certification across the EU is a goal to be pursued, due to challenges, posed by proliferation of nationally  focused certifications in relation to market recognition, trust, economic factors and (legal) uncertainty. The  EDPD has the mandate to approve EU wide criteria, that lead to the European Data Protection Seal.  Scaling for SMEs  As provided by the GDPR, development of certification mechanisms should be encouraged, keeping in  mind specific needs of small, medium and micro enterprises (SMEs). There are many enterprises falling in  that category. At the same time, SMEs may be processing large quantities of personal data, which may  pose significant risks to individuals (for instance in the market of m-Health apps). As certification may be a  lengthy and costly process SMEs are unlikely to be motivated to undertake certification due to their  resource limitations. However, SMEs with low risk processing operations may benefit from using the  published approved criteria to assess their level of conformity. Such self-assessment would not lead to  certification or issuance of a seal, since it does not fulfil the conditions of Art. 42 and 43 GDPR.  54 Golyardi S, Hortensius D, Lau YY, Burnik J et al.

Recommendations on European Data Protection Certification  Version 1.0  |  November 2017  29  Nevertheless, it may still have an added value for the SMEs themselves and their demonstration of  compliance (with self-made documentation) to the supervisory authorities.  The European Data Protection Board (EDPB), in close cooperation with national certification bodies  and supervisory authorities (DPAs), should promote an EU scalable approach with approved and  widely accepted criteria.  Exchange best practices and lessons learnt with certification practises in other  domains  Data protection certification mechanisms, seals or marks under GDPR have specificities that do not allow  for a direct analogy with existing successful certification practises and approaches in other domains, such  as ICT security. GDPR provisions require that a certification mechanism must concern an activity of data  processing. Such activity may be (also an integral) part of a product, a system, or service, but the  certification must be granted in relation to the processing activit(ies), and not to the product, system or  service as such, which is not the case in the aforementioned example of ICT security certification.  Nevertheless, the experience accumulated and the best practises already implemented in other domains  could support European Commission, EDPB and national certification and supervisory authorities on  further laying out and implementing certification mechanisms under GDPR. Such experience56 can pertain  identification and analysis of relevant market needs and trends to better match demand and supply,  mutual recognition procedures, identification of standardisation gaps and coordination of standardisation  activities at EU level.  The European Commission and the European Data Protection Board (EDPB), in close cooperation with  national certification bodies and supervisory authorities (DPAs), should stimulate the exchange of  best practises and lessons learnt from certification practices in other well established domains (e.g.  cybersecurity).  56 See for example relevant ENISA’s work in this field: https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/standards/certification  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/standards/certification  Recommendations on European Data Protection Certification  Version 1.0  |  November 2017  30  7.

Recommendations on European Data Protection Certification  Version 1.0  |  November 2017  32  Annex A: Analysis of existing certifications overview  ePrivacyseal  ePrivacyseal  Scope & Subject matter  The ePrivacyseal certifies products or services, that are in line with the pre-determined  criteria catalogue of the ePrivacyseal scheme.57  Requirements & Normative basis  ePrivacyseal states that it derives the criteria from the ‘European data privacy law’, which  they refer to as the ‘applicable EU Data Protection Directives’ and the EU General Data  Protection Regulation. In addition, there is a set of criteria related to the ‘Online Behavioral  Advertising’ framework. In terms of topics, the criteria cover a broad range of topics, such as  the principles of processing, grounds for lawful processing, and data subjects’ rights.  Certification process  The certification process of the ePrivacySeal EU involves five stages:   Definition of targets   Workshop   Optimisation   Final Evaluation   Certification  Stages 1-3 are preparatory for the evaluation process (‘final evaluation’ stage). In the  context of the workshop, technical and legal experts examine the product or service on the  basis of relevant technical, organisational and legal requirements. The final evaluation stage  entails testing from the auditors according to the ePrivacy criteria catalogue and  recommendations for improvements. The final phase of the process is the application for  seal and the licensing of the ePrivacyseal.  ePrivacy provides that consulting and audit services are provided by the ePrivacy GmbH, the  assignment of the privacy seal occurs through another company, the ePrivacyseal GmbH.  Accreditation of certification body  The ePrivacy GmbH does not provide that it is itself an accredited certification body by the  National Accreditation Body of Germany, where the enterprise is established.  Duration of process Not specified  Post-certification surveillance Not specified  Validity period of certification Two years, re-certification is possible  Resources  Information regarding the costs of the services are available in the Terms and Conditions of  the ePrivacy.58  Issued certifications ePrivacyseal EU has been awarded to 27 companies (until September 2017)59.  57 The criteria catalogue is available online.  https://www.eprivacy.eu/fileadmin/Redakteur/PDF/Kriterienkataloge/ePrivacyseal_criteria_catalog_EU_july_2016.p df  58 General Terms and Conditions of Business, version of December 2016  https://www.eprivacy.eu/fileadmin/Redakteur/PDF/2016.12_ePrivacy_General_T_C_EN.pdf  59 https://www.eprivacy.eu/en/customers/awarded-seals/#seal5  https://www.eprivacy.eu/fileadmin/Redakteur/PDF/Kriterienkataloge/ePrivacyseal_criteria_catalog_EU_july_2016.pdf https://www.eprivacy.eu/fileadmin/Redakteur/PDF/Kriterienkataloge/ePrivacyseal_criteria_catalog_EU_july_2016.pdf https://www.eprivacy.eu/en/customers/awarded-seals/#seal5  Recommendations on European Data Protection Certification  Version 1.0  |  November 2017  33  EuroPrise  EuroPrise  Scope & Subject matter  The subjects of the scheme are IT products such as hardware (e.g., a hardware  firewall) and software (e.g., a database application in a hospital) and IT-based  services and automated processing of data (e.g., commissioned data processing,  websites). Evaluation of such a service includes auditing of live performance of  data processing. Evaluated is either the complete product (e.g., a piece of  software) or a part of a product. EuroPrise also certifies websites and  “commissioned data processing”.60  The aim of certification is increasing market transparency for privacy relevant  products and an enlargement of the market for Privacy Enhancing Technologies  and increase of trust in IT by certifying privacy compliance with European data  protection regulations (Europrise 2017).  Requirements & Normative basis  One list of criteria based on the Directive 95/46/EC and the ePrivacy Directive, and  a list of criteria based on the GDPR and the ePrivacy Directive are available on the  website of EuroPrise. The criteria are formulated as questions. According to  EuroPrise: “ Not each and every question will be applicable to each and every  product or service. The certification authority shall ensure that in any certification  procedure the relevant criteria are applied and that all related questions are  answered in a plausible manner, the appropriate granularity, and at a uniform and  comparable level.”61 However, there is no information available on the assessment  methodology on the applicability of such criteria.  Certification process  (1) EuroPrise experts evaluate the product or service  in line with the evaluation criteria specified for intended usage, legal framework  and technical environment of the product. They report their findings in an  evaluation report. The evaluation criteria include: overview of fundamental issues,  legitimacy of data processing, technical-organizational measures, data subject's  rights.  (2) Certification body checks the evaluation results  The certification body checks the evaluation report with respect to completeness,  plausibility and comparability with other certifications.  A certification report is  published. Additionally, a short public report summarizing the evaluation findings is  published.  (3) Award of European Privacy Seal  The certification body compiles an internal certification report, awards of the seal  and publishes of the short public report. The certification is granted by the  EuroPrise Gmbh, the only entity issuing certificates and performing certification  assessment.  Accreditation of certification body No information available  Duration of process Not specified  Post-certification surveillance Not specified  Validity period of certification Two years, re-certification is possible  60 https://www.european-privacy-seal.eu/EPS-en/certifications-offered  61 The criteria catalogue is available online.  https://www.european-privacy-seal.eu/EPS-en/Criteria  https://www.european-privacy-seal.eu/EPS-en/certifications-offered https://www.european-privacy-seal.eu/EPS-en/Criteria  Recommendations on European Data Protection Certification  Version 1.0  |  November 2017  34  Resources  Costs for the evaluation by the experts and fees for certification by the certification  bodies. The evaluation costs are negotiated between applicant and expert. The  costs for certification are set by certification body.  Issued certifications From 2008 until September 2017: 68 Certifications (including re-certifications)  Recommendations on European Data Protection Certification  Version 1.0  |  November 2017  35  CNIL Labels  CNIL Labels  Scope & Subject matter  The subject of certification may be any natural person or legal entity, whose  procedure or product corresponds to one of the standards published by the  CNIL in the Official Journal.  Requirements & Normative basis  Requirements are currently set in 4 standards:  1. Audit procedures covering the processing of personal data: The processing  audit privacy seal delivered by the CNIL does not directly apply to processing  carried out. It applies to the audit procedure which is used to check that these  processes are compliant with the French data protection act. The procedure  describes the various stages and processes according to which such an audit must  be prepared, implemented and finalised. It also includes requirements regarding  the organisation performing the audit, and the auditors themselves. It can be  issued for processing audit procedures carried out by service providers  (consulting firms, lawyers, etc.,) or by organisations (in this case, we speak of an  internal audit). CNIL’s privacy seal is delivered to legal and technical audits.  2. Data protection training courses: CNIL's privacy seal can be delivered for  internal training courses to an organisation, either for training courses in the  classroom or via e-learning, providing they meet the requirements of the  standard.  3. Digital safe boxes: they differ from a storage space in that the data that is  stored there (documents and some meta data) is only accessible to the holder of  the safe box, and to any persons whom he/she may have mandated. Service- providers who carry out a digital safe box (operators) or propose one to users  (suppliers) may apply for the privacy seal. The request may therefore be made  jointly by the operator and its customer (the supplier).  4. Personal Data governance procedures are all measures, rules and best  practices for managing an organisation's personal data. CNIL examines the  compliance of the request for certification of the organisation with 25  requirements, all cumulative, in the standard relative to three topics: internal  organisation of the management of personal data; the procedure for checking  compliance of processing with the Act; the management of complaints and  incidents (CNIL 2017).  5. A certificate is recognition by the CNIL that a product or a procedure is  compliant with the provisions of the French Data Protection Act. It does not aim  to exempt its holders from administrative formalities (CNIL 2017)  Certification process  The procedure consists of the following stages:  1. Application: the applicant sends its request on a form, available at the CNIL  website. It must provide all elements for demonstrating that its procedure or  product is compliant with the requirements of the standard.  2. Admissibility assessment: CNIL has 2 months to analyse the admissibility of  an application. Failing this, it is deemed to be admissible.  3. Examination by the Privacy Seals unit of CNIL where exchanges may take  place between the privacy seal division and the applicant to clarify some points  in the application.  Recommendations on European Data Protection Certification  Version 1.0  |  November 2017  36  4. Compliance assessment by the Labelling Committee: When examination by  Privy Seals Unit is complete, it is presented to the certification committee, which  performs Legal analysis, develops recommendations and plan of corrective  actions.  5. Presentation and granting of the privacy seal: The decision to deliver a  privacy seal is made by the Data Protection Authority meeting in its plenary  configuration.  6. Notification and publication. The decision is sent to the applicant,  accompanied by personalised logos in the name of the holder of the privacy seal,  as well as the regulations for using the brand, and it is published on the CNIL’s  website, then on Légifrance (CNIL 2017)62  Accreditation of certification  body  Not applicable (The seals are awarded only by the CNIL, there are no  certification bodies involved)  Duration of process  Examination of the application for certification takes place in two stages: the  admissibility of the application and the examination. The CNIL has 2 months to  analyse the admissibility of an application. The period of examination varies. The  privacy seal must be delivered within 6 months from reception of the last  elements necessary to satisfying the requirements of the standard.  Post-certification surveillance  The CNIL may check at any time and by any means that the certified product or  procedure complies with the conditions defined in the standard. CNIL can  withdraw a privacy seal. On its Internet site, the CNIL keeps an up-to-date list of  products and procedures that are certified, with the identity of their holders.  Validity period of certification 3 years, re-certification/renewal is possible  Resources  No fee is paid to CNIL for award of a seal. However, the applicant may need to  devote organization resources to comply with standards and adapt its practices.  Issued certifications  CNIL has issued 91 certifications (including re-certifications) until September  201763  62 See for instance:  https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichCnil.do?oldAction=rechExpCnil&id=CNILTEXT000032460877&fastReqId=183075 7081&fastPos=1  63 https://www.cnil.fr/fr/labels  https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichCnil.do?oldAction=rechExpCnil&id=CNILTEXT000032460877&fastReqId=1830757081&fastPos=1 https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichCnil.do?oldAction=rechExpCnil&id=CNILTEXT000032460877&fastReqId=1830757081&fastPos=1 https://www.cnil.fr/fr/labels  Recommendations on European Data Protection Certification  Version 1.0  |  November 2017  37  ICO Privacy Seal  ICO Privacy Seal (under development) *  Scope & Subject matter  In 2015, the UK Information Commissioner announced its intention to  introduce a national privacy seal, as a stamp of approval ‘which  demonstrates good privacy practice and high data protection  compliance standards’.64 The aim of the seal is not only to demonstrate  compliance of the certified organisation with the requirements of the  UK Data Protection Act, but to show that it surpasses the legal  requirements ‘when it comes to looking after people’s information’.  The ICO Privacy Seal will show that the certified organisation went  ‘above and beyond the call of duty’.  The scheme operators (other than the ICO) will focus on different  sectors, processes, products or areas of compliance.65  Requirements & Normative basis Requirements from the UK Data Protection Act  Certification process  Organisations wishing to apply for an ICO privacy seal will then be able  to make an application to a relevant scheme operator. Organisations  will be awarded an ICO privacy seal ‘if they can show that they meet  the operator’s assessment criteria and in doing so demonstrate that  they meet the highest data protection standards’. Despite not directly  involved in the process of awarding the ICO privacy seal, the data  protection authority will retain powers over the overall operation of  the seal, such as the power to withdraw the endorsement to a scheme  operator.

Certified organisation is able to identify and mitigate information  security risks to desired levels, improve trust into its services and  manage information security processes.  Requirements & Normative basis  ISO/IEC 27001 defines the mandatory requirements for an Information  Security Management System (ISMS).  Certification process  The certification process includes:  1. A two-stage initial audit, defined by the ISO/IEC 17021 and ISO/IEC  27006 standards,  where:  2. Stage 1 is dedicated to the review of the documented ISMS against  the standard,  and  3. Stage 2 to the review of the implementation of the ISMS within the  business and evidence of adherence.  4. Surveillance audits in the first and second years that are carried  out in order to verify that the organisation remain compliant to the  standard,  5. A recertification audit in the third year prior to expiration of  certification. The certification can later be renewed for subsequent  three-year periods (ENISA 2013).  6. The certificate can be revoked or suspended if the annual audit  finds reasons for it. The certification body suspends certification in cases  when, for example, the client's certified management system has  persistently or seriously failed to meet certification requirements,  including requirements for the effectiveness of the management  system, the certified client does not allow surveillance or recertification  audits to be conducted at the required frequencies, or the certified  client has voluntarily requested a suspension (ENISA 2013).  Accreditation of certification body  ISO directs its clients to accredited certification bodies, which have  acquired independent confirmation of competence by an Accreditation  Body. Accredited certification bodies must be able to offer certification  in conformity with ISO/IEC 17021-1 standard, which contains principles  and requirements for the competence, consistency and impartiality of  bodies providing audit and certification of all types of management  systems and ISO/IEC 27006 standard which provides requirements for  bodies providing audit and certification of information security  management systems (criteria document for accreditation, peer  assessment or other audit processes) (ISO 2017).  Duration of process  The length of the certification procedure as a whole depends on the  scope of certification. According to a previous study the time period  that was required for the surveyed companies in order to prepare for  Recommendations on European Data Protection Certification  Version 1.0  |  November 2017  39  the certification varied between 3 and 18 months, the majority of the  companies required about 6 to 12 months in order to complete the  preparation. The certification process itself did not exceed a week.67  Post-certification surveillance Depends on the certification body that provides the certification  Validity period of certification 3 years  Resources Not specified  Issued certifications  A total of 27536 certificates were issued worldwide in 2015, taking into  account only those awarded by accredited certification bodies (ISO  2015)  67 ENISA 2013, p.19  Recommendations on European Data Protection Certification  Version 1.0  |  November 2017  40  Certification based on ISO/IEC 27018  Certification based on ISO/IEC 27018  Scope & Subject matter  ISO/IEC 27018:2014 Code of Conduct establishes commonly accepted  control objectives, controls and guidelines for implementing measures  to protect Personally Identifiable Information (PII) in accordance with  the privacy principles in ISO/IEC 29100 for the public cloud computing  environment. It specifies guidelines based on ISO/IEC 27002, taking  into consideration the regulatory requirements for the protection of PII  which might be applicable within the context of the information  security risk environment(s) of a provider of public cloud services.  Requirements & Normative basis  Controls relate to Information security policies, organisations of  information security, human resource security, asset management,  access control, cryptography, physical and environmental security,  operations security, communications security, system acquisition – development & maintenance, supplier relationships, information  security incident management, continuity managements, compliance  with legal and contractual requirements.

Requirements & Normative basis  The criteria are based on the 7 foundational principles of Privacy By  Design (The criteria are based on the 7 Foundational Principles of  Privacy by Design:  1. Proactive not Reactive; Preventative not Remedial  2. Privacy as the Default Setting  3. Privacy Embedded into Design  4. Full Functionality – Positive-Sum, not Zero-Sum  5. End-to-End Security – Full Lifecycle Protection  6. Visibility and Transparency – Keep it Open  7. Respect for User Privacy – Keep it User-Centric  The list of criteria and the relevant control activities are available  online.72  Privacy by Design Certification does not signify compliance with  Ontario privacy laws.73  Certification process  The process starts with the application of the interested  organisation. The “Privacy and Big Data Institute” reviews the  application and forwards the information to Deloitte Canada to begin  the assessment. The applicant makes a separate agreement with  Deloitte Canada. Deloitte Deloitte “scrutinize the product(s),  services(s) and/or offering(s) being certified, conduct interviews, and  examine operational processes. Deloitte will then issue a report  based on the assessment methodology and scorecard technique  developed exclusively for Privacy by Design Certification which  examines the organization’s adherence to Privacy by Design”.74  Following Deloitte’s report, the Privacy by Design Centre of  Excellence issues a decision on granting the certification. The  organisation that is granted the Privacy by Design Certification, may  use the relevant seal, called “Certification Shield”.  71 http://www.ryerson.ca/pbdce/certification/  72 http://www.ryerson.ca/content/dam/pbdce/certification/Privacy-by-Design-Certification-Program-Assessment- Methodology-20161011.pdf  73 http://www.ryerson.ca/pbdce/certification/  74 http://www.ryerson.ca/pbdce/certification/process/  http://www.ryerson.ca/content/dam/pbdce/certification/Privacy-by-Design-Certification-Program-Assessment-Methodology-20161011.pdf http://www.ryerson.ca/content/dam/pbdce/certification/Privacy-by-Design-Certification-Program-Assessment-Methodology-20161011.pdf http://www.ryerson.ca/pbdce/certification/ http://www.ryerson.ca/pbdce/certification/process/  Recommendations on European Data Protection Certification  Version 1.0  |  November 2017  43  Accreditation of certification body Not specified  Duration of process Not specified  Post-certification surveillance  Annual.

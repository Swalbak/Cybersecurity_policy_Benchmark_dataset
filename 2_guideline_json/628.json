ENISA welcomes the new proposed cybersecurity act which provides for a strengthened ENISA  with additional resources and staff. In addition to this, ENISA welcomes the 2017 cybersecurity package of  legislative and non-legislative cybersecurity measures. ENISA also looks forward to the new permanent  mandate, for the additional resources and additional budget to contribute to the new tasks provided for in  the current version of the cybersecurity act.  ENISA welcomes cooperation in the area of cybersecurity. Current challenges are common worldwide; a  lot of effort is needed to mitigate the risks and to address the global challenges. Many EU MSs will benefit  from a joint approach and EU institutions and EU bodies such as ENISA can help to foster effective EU  cooperation, maximising the outcome and impact of developed solutions, best practices, methodologies  and mechanisms supporting cybersecurity.  ENISA welcomes the proposed tasks related to the education and improvement of skills to address the  lack of digital and cybersecurity skills in the EU. At EU level, there is an increased need for digital skills and  cybersecurity skills in particular. It is acknowledged currently that 44 % of European citizens do not have  basic digital skills (1); Europe also lacks skilled ICT specialists to fill the growing number of job vacancies in  all sectors of the economy.  The cybersecurity talent shortage (2) is estimated at more than a million openings worldwide with many  thousands of companies having difficulties in filling posts. The problem is here and is likely to stay. The  global shortage of cybersecurity professionals is estimated to rise to two million by 2019 (3). The ENISA  Threat landscape report 2016 acknowledges the skills shortage (4) and recommends engagements in the  areas of cybersecurity education, training and awareness.  ENISA is ready to work closely with all relevant stakeholders to make the certification proposal a reality.  ENISA welcomes the proposal for an EU-wide cybersecurity-certification framework presented in the draft  cybersecurity act. It provides for several assurance levels and specific evaluation criteria. In addition, the  cybersecurity act draft proposes conditions for marking and labelling; it sets out the mechanisms to  demonstrate continual compliance as appropriate; it provides for the conditions to grant maintenance and  extension of a certificate etc.  The proposal is an EU initiative for an EU-based framework that meets the demands of private  stakeholders as well as those of the MSs. The prospect for the market can be significant as the EU can  improve its position in internal market purchasing (private as well as through public procurement) and  become a reference point to meet the challenge posed by global competition.  ENISA is looking forward to assuming the new roles seeking to support the Commission in its duties and  the MSs in transitioning to an EU framework.

For several years ENISA has been improving its planning and in consultation with its management  board (MB) set out priorities for its activities in order to be able to deliver the most urgent, important and  sensitive results for the protection our EU cyberspace. In the preparation of the 2019 work programme  ENISA, together with its MB, decided to prepare the planning by considering two scenarios. These are (a)  Scenario 1, which assumes no change to the current mandate and (b) Scenario 2 where it is assumed that  the cybersecurity act is adopted.  In detail, Scenario 1 (assuming that the new regulation is not in place) uses the resources available in the  multiannual financial framework (MFF) 2014-2020 (COM(2013)519) while Scenario 2, (new regulation in  place by latest mid-2019) adds new tasks and activities as proposed in the Cybersecurity Act  COM(2017)477 using resources as proposed in the draft general budget of the European Union for the  financial year 2019 (5).  In this programming document, the planned activities for 2019 in both scenarios are presented. The  document follows the structure laid down by the new Commission guidelines for programming documents  provided in the context of the framework financial regulation and the five pillars of the ENISA strategy.  Activities are labelled indicating to which scenario these activities belong. Activities labelled as Scenario 2  are only proposed to be delivered if the draft Cybersecurity Act is adopted. Section ‘List of outputs in 2019  work programme’, just before the annexes, summarises the outputs for the two scenarios: the first list  covers the Scenario 1 outputs, to be delivered independent of the adoption of the cybersecurity act, while  the second list includes the new outputs to be delivered as soon as the cybersecurity act is published in the  Official Journal.  I look forward to the next phase in ENISA’s development.

The mission of ENISA has been to contribute to securing Europe’s information society by raising  ‘awareness of network and information security [(NIS)] and to develop and promote a culture, of network  and information security in society for the benefit of citizens, consumers, enterprises and public sector  organisations in the Union’ (6).  ENISA supports the European institutions, the Member States and the business community in addressing,  responding to and especially in preventing NIS problems. It does so through a series of activities across five  areas identified in its strategy.   Expertise: information, knowledge and skill on key NIS issues.   Policy: support policymaking and implementation in the EU.   Capacity: support capacity building across the EU (e.g. through training, recommendations and  awareness-raising activities).   Community: promote the NIS community (e.g. support computer emergency response teams  (CERTs), coordination of pan-European cyber exercises).   Enabling (e.g. engagement with stakeholders and furthering of international relations).  In doing so, ENISA will act ‘without prejudice to the competence of the Member States regarding network  and information security and ... to activities concerning public security, defence, national security’ (7) and in  compliance with the right of initiative of the European Commission. In order to achieve its mission, several  objectives and tasks (8) have been assigned to ENISA.  In line with these objectives and tasks, ENISA carries out its operations under an annual and multiannual  work programme containing all of its planned activities drawn up by the executive director and adopted by  the MB.  ENISA’s approach is strongly impact driven, based on the involvement of all relevant stakeholder  communities, with a strong emphasis on pragmatic solutions that offer a sensible mix of short-term and  long-term improvements. ENISA also provides the EU institutions, bodies and agencies (hereinafter:  ‘European Union institutions’) and the Member States with a mechanism allowing them to call upon its  services to support their NIS capability development (9), resulting in a more agile and flexible approach to  achieving its mission.

ENISA will reinforce these communication channels via the  development of sustainable cooperation in its various domains of competence.   Working closely with competent EU institutions dealing with other aspects of NIS (the European Union  Agency for Law-Enforcement Cooperation (Europol), the European Defence Agency (EDA), the  European External Action Service (EEAS), sectorial agencies, etc.).   Achieving results by leveraging relevant stakeholder communities, allowing ENISA to strengthen its  knowledge of national NIS developments and facilitate the involvement of NIS experts in its activities,  from NIS national competent authorities, the private sector and academia.   Supporting public-private cooperation, with a view to reducing the fragmentation of the digital single  market and support the development of the digital security industry in Europe.  A stronger ENISA as of 2020  • EU policy development and implementation   Proactively contributing to the development of policy in the area of NIS, as well as to other policy  initiatives with cybersecurity elements in different sectors (e.g. energy, transport and finance).   Providing independent opinions and preparatory work for the development and the update of  policy and law.   Supporting EU policy and law in the areas of electronic communications, electronic identity and  trust services, with a view to promoting an enhanced level of cybersecurity.   Assisting Member States in achieving a consistent approach on the implementation of the NISD  across borders and sectors, as well as in other relevant policies and laws.   Providing regular reporting on the state of implementation of the EU legal framework.  • Capacity building   Contributing to the improvement of EU and national public authority capabilities and expertise,  including on incident response and on the supervision of cybersecurity-related regulatory  measures.   Contributing to the establishment of information-sharing and analysis centres (ISACs) in various  sectors by providing information on best practice and guidance on available tools and procedures,  as well as by appropriately addressing regulatory issues related to information sharing.  • Knowledge and information, awareness raising   Becoming a key information hub of the EU for cybersecurity.   Promoting and sharing best practice and initiatives across the EU by pooling information on  cybersecurity deriving from the EU and national institutions, agencies and bodies.   Making advice, guidance and information on critical-infrastructure security best practice available.   In the aftermath of significant cross-border cybersecurity incidents, compiling reports with a view  to providing guidance to businesses and people across the EU.   Regularly organising awareness-raising activities in coordination with MS authorities.  ENISA programming document 2019-2021  final | December 2018  11  • Market-related tasks (standardisation, cybersecurity certification)   Performing a number of functions specifically supporting the internal market and e.g. to provide a  cybersecurity ‘market observatory’ by analysing relevant trends in the cybersecurity market to  better match demand and supply and by supporting EU policy development in ICT standardisation  and ICT cybersecurity certification areas.   With regard to standardisation in particular, facilitating the establishment and uptake of  cybersecurity standards.   Executing the tasks provided for in the context of the future framework for certification.  • Research and innovation (R & I)   Contributing its expertise by advising EU and national authorities on priority setting in research  and development (R & D), including in the context of the contractual public-private partnership on  cybersecurity (cPPP).   Advising the new European cybersecurity research and competence centre on research under the  next multi-annual financial framework   Being involved (when asked to do so by the Commission) in the implementation of research and  innovation (R & I) EU funding programmes.  • Operational cooperation and crisis management   Strengthening the existing preventive operational capabilities, in particular upgrading the pan- European cybersecurity exercises (Cyber Europe).   Supporting operational cooperation as secretariat of the computer-security and incident-response  team (CSIRTs Network) (as per NISD provisions) by ensuring, among other things, the good  functioning of the CSIRTs Network IT infrastructure and communication channels and by ensuring  structured cooperation with CERT-EU, the European Cybercrime Centre (EC3), EDA and other  relevant EU institutions in line with the Commission proposal for the cybersecurity act (10).  • Play a role in the EU cybersecurity blueprint   Presented as part of this package and setting the Commission’s recommendation to Member  States for a coordinated response to large-scale cross-border cybersecurity incidents and crises at  EU level in line with the Commission proposal for the cybersecurity act.   Facilitating cooperation e.g. at blueprint technical (CSIRT) and operational level (single point of  contact), between individual Member States in dealing with emergency response by analysing and  aggregating national situational reports based on information made available to ENISA on a  voluntary basis by Member States and other entities.  • Cybersecurity certification of ICT products and services   European cybersecurity-certification framework for ICT products and services specifies the  essential functions and tasks of ENISA in cybersecurity certification. The draft sets out that ENISA  prepares the European cybersecurity-certification schemes, with the assistance, expert advice and  close cooperation of the European cybersecurity-certification group. Upon the EU Commission’s  request to prepare a scheme for specific ICT products and services, ENISA will work on the scheme  in close cooperation with national certification supervisory authorities represented in the group.  The same may apply upon the request of the Member States or the group.  (10) COM(2017)477  ENISA programming document 2019-2021  final | December 2018  12  Section I. General context  Threat landscape  2017 was the year in which incidents in the cyber-threat landscape have led to the definitive recognition of  some omnipresent facts. We have gained unwavering evidence on monetisation methods, attacks to  democracies, cyber-war, transformation of malicious infrastructures and the dynamics within threat-agent  groups.  But 2017 has also brought successful operations against cybercriminals. Law enforcement, governments  and vendors have managed to shut down illegal dark markets, de-anonymise the darknet and arrest  cybercriminals. Moreover, state-sponsored campaigns have been revealed and details of technologies  deployed by nation states have been leaked. Most remarkable though is the manifestation of the cyber- threat landscape within framework programmes that are about to be established in the area of critical- infrastructure protection: cyber threats make up the basis for the development and implementation of red  and blue teaming activities in financial sector across Europe.  The cybersecurity community is still far from striking the balance between defenders and attackers.  Although 2017 has reached records in security investment, it has also brought new records in cyberattacks  of all kinds, data breaches and information loss. From this perspective, one may argue that there is a  market failure in cybersecurity; that is, the increased defence levels and expenses cannot successfully  reduce levels of cyber-threat exposure.  Whether this is due to a segmented cybersecurity market, lack of awareness or capabilities and skills, are  topics of vivid discussions in the corresponding communities. The fact is however, that in 2017 we have  seen extremely increased amounts of information on cybersecurity incidents, cyber threats and related  matters deluge all kinds of media. This trend is indicative for the high level of interest assigned by the  media to cybersecurity issues.  In summary, the main trends in the 2017 cyber-threat landscape were as follows.   Complexity of attacks and sophistication of malicious actions in cyberspace continued increasing.   Threat agent of all types have advanced in obfuscation (that is, hiding their trails).   Malicious infrastructures continue their transformation towards multipurpose configurable  functions including anonymisation, encryption, detection and evasion.   Monetisation of cybercrime is becoming the main motive of threat agents, in particular cyber- criminals. They take advantage of the anonymity offered by digital currencies.   State-sponsored people or organisations are one of the most omnipresent malicious agents in  cyberspace. They are top concern of commercial and governmental defenders.   Cyber-war is entering dynamically into cyberspace creating increased concerns to critical- infrastructure operators, especially in areas that experience some sort of crisis.   Skills and capabilities are the main concerns for organisations. The extensive need for related  training programmes and educational curricula remains almost unsatisfied.  All these trends are assessed and analysed by means of the content of the ENISA Threat landscape report  2017. Identified open issues leveraged on these trends and proposed policy, business and  research/educational action. They serve as recommendations and are taken into account in the future  activities of ENISA and its stakeholders.  ENISA programming document 2019-2021  final | December 2018  13  In 2017 the frequency and impact of serious incidents grew. The proliferation of ransomware, for example,  reached an approximate 2 000 % increase in 2017 and drew everyone’s attention to the reality of cyber  threats and their possible critical impacts and costs.  The cooperation between law-enforcement agencies and private-sector organisations was an important  factor in identifying malicious activities and infrastructure takedowns and it is likely that such cooperation  activities between communities as well as between Member States, will play an increasingly important role  both in the fight against cybercrime and in the attempt to reinforce EU systems against potential attacks.  Concluding, on top of a quite active cybercrime scene, the ETL has indicated that high profile (state- sponsored) attackers have advanced in line with the developments of the entire threat landscape:  complexity, sophistication and advancements in capabilities have been observed for most of the threat- agent groups. While the race between the ‘good’ and the ‘bad’ guys continues, advancements in  obfuscation and masquerading of threat agents make it more difficult to understand who is who. This  difficulty has led to an alerting phenomenon: the user community cannot differentiate between the bad  and the good and thus lose trust in commercial and even institutional players in cyberspace.  In the context of all these developments, ENISA has identified numerous activities to cope with the trends  of the cyber-threat landscape and increase knowledge and capability levels for various stakeholder groups.  Policy initiatives  Since its set up in 2004 the EU NIS agency, ENISA, has actively contributed to: raising awareness of NIS  challenges in Europe, the development of Member State NIS capacities and the reinforcement of the  cooperation of Member States and other NIS stakeholders.  NIS has been set high in the EU political agenda (notably in the European cybersecurity strategy (2013), the  European cyber defence policy framework (2014) and in the European digital single market (2015)). ENISA  will need to accompany the efforts of Member States and EU institutions in reinforcing NIS across Europe.  Above all, the recent adoption of the European directive on measures to ensure a high common level of NIS  further calls for ENISA to enhance its commitment to supporting a consistent approach towards NIS across  Europe.  While ENISA should continue its well-established activities (from the support to the reinforcement of MS  national capacities to the organisation of cyber-crisis exercises) the adoption of the NISD will require ENISA  to develop further areas of action to accompany the evolution of NIS in Europe. ENISA will play a key role in:  contributing to the NIS technical and operational cooperation by actively supporting MS CSIRT cooperation  within the European CSIRTs Network and the NIS Cooperation Group; providing input and expertise for  policy-level collaboration between national competent authorities as part of the cooperation group;  supporting the reinforcement EU institution NIS in strong cooperation with CERT-EU and with the institutions  themselves. In parallel, ENISA will continue to contribute to the reinforcement of NIS as a driver of the digital  single market (DSM) and more generally of economic growth in Europe, including the development of NIS  and related ICT industries in Europe.  While several EU institutions are mandated to act in the area of cybersecurity (CERT-EU, Europol, the EDA,  the EEAS, etc.) ENISA aims to be the key point of reference for strategic analysis and advice on NIS issues.  ENISA seeks to engage with other stakeholders (in particular the private sector) to use its experience and  expertise to support them in their activities and to engage them in the EU effort to ensure a significant  improvement of the state of cybersecurity in Europe.  The publication of the new EU cybersecurity package with its set of legislative and non-legislative measures  (13 September 2017) has identified ENISA as a key pillar of the EU’s ambition towards the reinforcement of  cybersecurity across Europe. The strategy provides for the strengthening and reinforcing ENISA.

Summarising the key  indicators for the multiannual activities  ENISA developed key indicators to provide the metrics to measure performance, results and impact of the  ENISA outcomes and output. A detailed presentation of key performance indicators (KPIs), key results  indicators (KRIs) and key impact indicators (KII) is provided in Annex B.  Human and financial resource outlook 2019-2021  Annex A1 provided the resource outlook and contains a brief description of new tasks and efficiency gains.  ENISA programming document 2019-2021  final | December 2018  25  Section III. Work programme 2019  The ENISA 2019 work programme follows the layout presented in multiannual programming Section II. In  this section objectives, results and indicators are identified in relation to each activity.  The activities presented in this section follow the structure of the ENISA strategy. After a short description  of the activity the objectives are presented. A short narrative is included, consisting of a description of the  activity and its anticipated added value, the main challenges for 2019 and a link to the multiannual  objectives.  The main outputs/actions in the specific year, for this case for 2019, are listed within each objective. For  each objective there are several outputs set out.  For each output, the following are included in this document.   A description of the specific actions and outcome which are expected to contribute to the  achievement of the objective.   The type of output (in summary table at the end of each activity):  o P: publication (e.g. reports, studies, papers),  o E: event (e.g. conferences, workshops or seminars),  o S: support activity, involving assistance to or close collaboration with e.g. EU institutions or  Member States (as appropriate), for a specific activity that features established and shared  objectives.   KPIs tailored to the type of output in summary table at the end of each activity.   Resources and budget, in a summary table at the end of the section in aggregated form at activity  level.  For each activity there is an objective established that covers the actions that ENISA is carrying out in order  to respond to official ‘Article 14 requests’, named after Article 14 of the ENISA regulation (14), which allows  the MS and EU institutions to make direct requests to ENISA seeking assistance or advice on specific  activities.  In the preparation of the 2019 work programme, ENISA is considering two scenarios. Scenario 1 uses the  resources available in MFF 2014-2020 (COM(2013)519). Scenario 2 (which assumes that the new  regulation will be in place by latest mid-2019), adds new tasks and activities using resources as proposed in  the draft Cybersecurity Act COM(2017)477 and in alignment with the draft 2019 EU general budget . Each  output is labelled accordingly as a Scenario 1 or Scenario 2 output. Activities labelled as Scenario 2 are only  proposed to be delivered if the draft cybersecurity act is adopted.  (14) According to Regulation (EU) No 526/2013. When the cybersecurity act is adopted (Scenario 2), these objectives will be reallocated and relabelled based  on the new legal framework and corresponding articles.  ENISA programming document 2019-2021  final | December 2018  26  Activity 1 — Expertise. Anticipate and support Europe in facing emerging network and  information-security challenges  Objective 1.1. Improving the expertise related to network and information security (NIS)  Output O.1.1.1 — Good practices for the security of the internet of things (IoT) (Scenario 1)  IoT is at the core of operations for many OES as defined in the NISD, especially considering recent  initiatives towards smart infrastructures, industry 4.0 (15), 5G (16), smart grids (17), etc. With a great impact  on the safety of the public, security and privacy, the IoT threat landscape is extremely complex. Therefore,  it is important to understand what exactly needs to be secured and to implement specific security  measures to protect the IoT from cyber threats.  Building on its previous work on IoT security, ENISA will identify and analyse existing IoT security practices  and standards (e.g. in the area of industry 4.0 and critical information infrastructures or consumer  electronics), taking into consideration existing national expertise and practices. ENISA will map the  evolving threat landscape and compare these practices and standards and develop good practices for the  security of the internet of things focusing on its impact on the overall supply chain and considering  relevant interdependencies.  To satisfy these goals, ENISA will take into account and contribute to existing EU policy and regulatory  initiatives (e.g. the NISD, the IoT action plan for Europe (18), the communication on building strong  cybersecurity for the EU (19), the PPP on cybersecurity (20) and the 5G infrastructure public-private  partnership (5G PPP) (21)).  ENISA will develop targeted IoT case studies to identify risks and vulnerabilities, by setting out appropriate  attack scenarios, and providing relevant recommendations and good practice. Moreover, it will consider  establishing e.g. IoT security requirements, maturity levels, procurement guidelines or other means to  promote awareness and to ensure security for safety. ENISA will also consider implementing online tools to  visualise IoT security measures in order to further support stakeholders.  ENISA will also validate the results of the study (e.g. via joint workshops such as the two organised with  Europol/EC3) with relevant national and EU initiatives (e.g. Alliance for the Internet of Things Innovation  (AIOTI), Industrial Internet Consortium IIC (IIC) and interact with important digitised industries in the EU  and IoT stakeholders from the public sector (e.g. DG Communications Networks, Content and Technology,  the Joint Research Centre (JRC), Europol/EC3), as well as from the private sector including operators,  integrators and manufacturers.  This work item builds on previous ENISA work in the area of IoT (WP2017-2018) and smart infrastructures  (WP2015-2017).

Smart cars already available today provide connected, added-value features in order to enhance car users’  experience or improve car safety. With this increased connectivity (which the emergence of 5G is expected  to further promote) novel cybersecurity risks and threats arise and need to be managed. In light of the  NISD, where road authorities and intelligent transport systems are among the entities identified as OES in  the road-transport subsector, there is a growing call for smart-car security to be addressed.  ENISA will build on its previous smart car work (22) and identify and analyse existing security practices and  standards in this area (e.g. UN-ECE dedicated task force (TF) on CYBER, International Organisation for  Standardisation (ISO)/SAE standardisation work) analysing the emerging notions of connectivity and  autonomy. ENISA will review these practices and standards and highlight or suggest good practices and  potential legislative action required for smart car security, safety, connectivity and autonomy, while  mapping the emerging threat landscape.  Building on the previous initiative ‘Europe on the Move’ of May 2017, the European Commission put  forward a strategy to make the EU a world leader for automated and connected mobility (17 May 2018).  To assist the Commission and the Member States in achieving these objectives ENISA will consider and  contribute to existing EU policy and regulatory initiatives (the NISD, the European strategy on cooperative  intelligent transport systems (23), the DG Mobility and Transport C-ITS platform (24), the high-level group  GEAR 2030 (25)), as well as the 3rd mobility package (26) and the communication on connected and  automated mobility (CAM). This agenda provides a common vision for developing and deploying key  technologies, services and infrastructure. Among these actions, it is envisaged that the Commission will  work towards the adoption of a recommendation by the end of 2018 to be addressed to the Member  States and industry. The recommendation would pertain to the use of pioneer spectrum for 5G large-scale  testing, cybersecurity issues and a data-governance framework that enables data sharing, in line with the  initiatives of the 2018 data package. ENISA will take into account industry initiatives such as the European  Automotive Telecom Alliance (EATA) and the 5G automotive alliance.  ENISA will develop targeted smart cars case studies to identify risks and vulnerabilities, by setting out  appropriate attack scenarios, and providing relevant recommendations and good practices to ensure  ‘security for safety’ in regard to connected and autonomous vehicles. This work should support the  Commission in the recommendation deliverable listed in the communication on CAM.  ENISA will examine the concept of information-sharing initiatives among relevant stakeholders in the  automotive sector. This stems from the relevant recommendations of the WP2016 ENISA study, as well as  related industry guidelines, e.g. Association des Constructeurs Européens d'Automobiles (ACEA).  ENISA will also validate the results of the study (e.g. via joint workshops) with relevant national and EU  initiatives (such as EATA and European Road Transport Telematics Implementation Co-ordination  Organisation (ERTICO) and interact with all important smart-car stakeholders from the public sector (such  as the relevant European Commission service, JRC, national road authorities and from the private sector  including automotive manufacturers, Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEMs)).

Output O.1.1.3 — Awareness raising on existing technical specifications for cryptographic algorithms  (Scenario 1)  In the revised cybersecurity strategy of the EU published in September (27), the European Commission  highlights ‘[…] the lack of European capacity on assessing the encryption of products and services used by  the public, businesses and governments within the digital single market. Strong encryption is the basis for  secure digital identification systems that play a key role in effective cybersecurity […]’. Furthermore, in  Article 10 of its proposal for a regulation on ENISA, the ‘EU cybersecurity agency’, repealing Regulation  (EU) 526/2013, of 13 Sept 2017, the European Commission is calling ENISA to ‘…advise the Union and the  Member States on research needs and priorities in the area of cybersecurity, with a view to enabling  effective responses to current and emerging risks and threats, including with respect to new and emerging  information and communications technologies, and to using risk-prevention technologies effective’. One of  the most important technologies satisfying the criteria of security-enhancing as well as privacy-enhancing  technology is encryption.  While acknowledging the importance of crypto-technologies in cybersecurity, encryption is still a key area  of national security, especially for the protection of sensitive governmental systems as well as critical  information infrastructures. To harmonise both market needs and MS responsibilities it is essential to work  together on sharing existing approaches, best practice and knowledge. In international standardisation,  technical specifications for cryptographic algorithms already exist which should be considered at European  level, too. Moreover, at European level the so-called SOGIS-MRA crypto catalogue (28) is already a major  achievement as the first comprehensive collection of cryptographic means agreed on by participating MS  competent authorities.  Working closely with the Member States, ENISA will act as a catalyst to raise awareness of already existing  cryptographic means based on a wider promotion of the SOGIS catalogue. Especially in light of the new EU  certification framework where ENISA plays a significant role, ENISA will start in 2019 to discuss with the  existing SOGIS crypto working group the possibilities of a long-term relationship and exchange. As a  starting point, ENISA will participate in respective meetings of the group.  For standardisation ENISA should facilitate the establishment and take-up of European and international  standards for risk management and for the security of ICT processes, products and services — and this  includes cryptography.  ENISA could engage with ETSI groups concerned with cryptography — primarily TC cyber and its Quantum- Safe Cryptography (QSC) subgroup as well as TC Electronic Signatures and Infrastructures (ESI). ENISA could  also promulgate the outputs of these groups by linking to them from its website. A similar arrangement  could be in place for relevant European Committee for Standardisation (CEN)/European Committee for  Electrotechnical Standardisation (Cenelec) groups (primarily JTC-13 as it begins its work).

Based  on ENISA studies, the current healthcare-sector cybersecurity situation has shown that the level of  cybersecurity is low. For example, most hospitals do not have a chief information-security officer, there is a  lack of security policies, of access control mechanisms; hospitals are easy targets due to their interoperable  systems and due to the high vulnerability of legacy medical devices.  Newly adopted EU legislation has indicated a shift in priorities: the NISD lists healthcare organisations as  OES, the medical devices regulation (29) (MDR) includes obligatory safety and security provisions for  medical devices and there is a Commission communication on enabling digital transformation of health  and care in the digital single market (30).  ENISA, based on previous experience, will support healthcare organisations in enhancing their  cybersecurity level by helping them to make the right decisions when procuring equipment and services  supporting their internal systems. ENISA will identify existing vulnerabilities and risks in healthcare- organisation systems (also those deriving from medical devices). ENISA will map the evolving threat  landscape and collect common practices for ensuring cybersecurity in these interoperable systems. The  ultimate goal is to provide healthcare organisations with a list of security requirements and measures in  order for them to make informed decisions when procuring equipment and services. This is not linked to  the certification topic.  To achieve these goals, ENISA will take into account existing national and EU policies and regulations, such  as the requirements deriving from the NISD and will not contradict and interfere with those provisions and  international standards (such as Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPPA) and ISO  27799) as well as position papers from Commission working groups (MDR working group and the eHealth  network).  ENISA will also validate the results of any studies (e.g. via joint workshops) with relevant national and EU  initiatives and interact with healthcare organisations and policymakers (e.g. ASIP Sante in France, SPMS in  Portugal), NIS competent authorities, as well as with experts from the private sector including operators,  integrators and manufacturers. ENISA will offer experts the possibility to contribute to this work through  informal expert groups.  This work builds on previous work of ENISA in the areas of healthcare security (WP 2015), smart hospitals  (WP 2016) and NISD implementation (WP 2017).  Output O.1.1.5 — Good practices for maritime security (port security) (Scenario 2)  Ports serve a critical function in domestic and international supply-chain activities by connecting sea and  inland transport services. In the EU sea, ports play a significant role, facilitating 90 % of the EU’s external  trade (by weight) and an additional 43 % of internal market exchanges. In addition, ports in the EU  constitute energy hubs for conventional and renewable energies, serve 400 million passengers annually  and generate employment (31). Ports are a critical information infrastructure for water transport and  (29) https://ec.europa.eu/growth/sectors/medical-devices/regulatory-framework_en  (30) https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/communication-enabling-digital-transformation-health-and-care-digital-single-market-  empowering  (31) https://ec.europa.eu/transport/modes/maritime/ports/ports_en  https://ec.europa.eu/growth/sectors/medical-devices/regulatory-framework_en https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/communication-enabling-digital-transformation-health-and-care-digital-single-market-empowering https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/communication-enabling-digital-transformation-health-and-care-digital-single-market-empowering https://ec.europa.eu/transport/modes/maritime/ports/ports_en  ENISA programming document 2019-2021  final | December 2018  30  identified as OES in the NISD, where managing bodies of ports, including their port facilities and entities  operating works and equipment contained within ports are all eligible to be classified as OES.  ENISA will provide port authorities and service providers and developers with good security and resilience  practices when designing, developing and deploying services in order to minimise the exposure of such  networks and services to all relevant cyber-threat categories. The good practices will consider both the  current port ICT environment and the emerging trends in business models and supporting ICT systems.  ENISA will take stock of existing practices and standards and develop good practices with a focus on critical  port services resilience and user safety, while analysing specific-use cases to determine attack scenarios.  In this endeavour ENISA will take into account and contribute to existing EU policy and regulatory  initiatives, such as the NISD and will not contradict and interfere with those national provisions, and  interact with key stakeholders from the public sector, such as DG Mobility and Transport and the European  Maritime Safety agency (EMSA) and from the private sector, such as managing bodies of ports, port  facilities, water-transport companies, operators of vessel-traffic services and ICT-product and service  vendors to collect information and validate study findings.  This work builds on previous work of ENISA in the areas of maritime (2011), intelligent transportation  systems (WP 2015) and smart critical infrastructures (2016).  Objective 1.2. NIS threat landscape and analysis  Output O.1.2.1 — Annual ENISA threat landscape (Scenario 1)  This report will provide an overview of current threats and their consequences. It contains tactical and  strategic information about cyber threats. It also refers to threat agents and attack vectors used. The  ENISA threat landscape (ETL) report is hence a source of generic cyberthreat intelligence (CTI) by means of  interrelated information objects. The contents of the report are based on an intensive information  collection exercise, followed by analysis and consolidation of publicly available information on cyber  threats, including annual incident reports.  The ENISA ETL provides information on threat-exposure reduction. This information will consist of available  controls that are appropriate in order to reduce exposure and so mitigate the resulting risks. In addition to  the ETL, ENISA will make available to the public all relevant material that has been collected during the  year.  The dissemination, concise presentation and online availability of CTI will be in focus in 2019. Available CTI  will be interlinked with other related ENISA results (see also chapter Multiannual priorities (2019-2021) for  Objective 1.2. NIS threat landscape and analysis).  In this manner, ETL stakeholders will be in a position to access and interact with ENISA cyberthreat  information on a permanent basis. In 2019, ENISA will continue the cooperation with CERT-EU in the area  of threat landscaping. This effort will be carried out by means of information exchanges, use of CERT-EU  services and the organisation of common meetings/events. In carrying out this work, collaboration with  related experts (e.g. ENISA ETL stakeholder group) and vendors (through memorandums of  understanding (MoUs)) will be maintained and expanded.  In 2019, ENISA will continue supporting the relevant CTI stakeholder community by organizing a CTI EU  event for dissemination of CTI good practices and providing an interaction platform. This is the main  ENISA programming document 2019-2021  final | December 2018  31  instrument of mobilisation of CTI stakeholders; it will engage in the dissemination of ENISA CTI information  of all kinds (e.g. Info notes).  Output O.1.2.2 — Restricted and public Info notes on NIS (Scenario 1)  ENISA provides guidance on important NIS events and developments through Info Notes. From 2018 ENISA  has produced two distinct types of info note; ‘CSIRT Info Notes’ and ‘general Info Notes’. This will be  continued in 2019.  CSIRT Info Notes  CSIRT Info Notes cover incidents and/or vulnerabilities of an EU dimension that are within the scope of  activities of the CSIRTs network. Such notes will only be published following the agreement of the CSIRTs  network whilst complying with its internal procedures.  General Info Notes  General info notes cover significant developments and announcements in cybersecurity. General info  notes are not a response to incidents or vulnerabilities but are rather explanatory notes e.g. on events that  reach a certain level of public and media attention. For general info notes, ENISA will consult the CSIRTs  network but also other resources as appropriate.  ENISA provides balanced and neutral information on such events, covering issues, points of action,  mitigation measures, summaries, related practices, etc. Hence, the objective of this work is to provide a  neutral overview of the state of play on an incident in a near-time manner.  Both types of Info Notes will be logically integrated with the cyber-threat information, thus building a  single interconnected knowledge base.  ENISA’s intention is to continue providing Info Notes as a reliable and continuous service to its  stakeholders in a timely manner.  Just as with ETL, ENISA will further continuously develop the dissemination efficiency of the procured  cyber-threat information Info Notes. For this purpose, available dissemination channels will be used to  enhance uptake among key stakeholders. In addition to the ENISA website, in 2019 Info Notes will be  disseminated via the ENISA ETL platform.  Output O.1.2.3 — Support incident-reporting activities in the EU (Scenario 1)  As EU-level incident-reporting obligations become more complex, developing efficient reporting schemes  across sectors and across geographical borders, while making sure they remain simple, pragmatic and  relevant for both the public and the private sector without increasing the cost of operation is one of the  objectives of the activities developed by ENISA in this sector.  Current and planned activities in this area include the following.   Incident notification in the telecom sector (Article 13a telecom package). Currently ENISA  facilitates the activities of the informal Article 13a expert group, keeping in touch with industry  and collecting and processing the incidents for the annual incident report. Further support is  needed as the telecom package is currently under review. The new EU electronic-communications  code (EECC) brings significant improvements to the security part along with the incident-reporting  framework.  ENISA programming document 2019-2021  final | December 2018  32   Incident notification for the trust-service providers (Article 19 eIDAS regulation). In 2019 ENISA will  continue receiving the annual incident reports from the competent authorities. ENISA will analyse  them and produce a consolidated, anonymised incident-analysis report. In addition, ENISA will  build on lessons learned from past incidents and recommend good practices to the Member  States. It will also continue engaging with the competent authorities towards a harmonised  implementation of this article and also engage with private-sector stakeholders to better  understand the needs and challenges of the sector.   Incident notification in the context of the NISD. Further guidelines and support are needed from  ENISA to facilitate the smooth implementation of the new provisions, using (where appropriate)  opportunities arising under the CEF. More specifically, ENISA can assist stakeholders in developing  sector-specific incident-reporting frameworks and procedures, develop cross-border incident- reporting frameworks, agree on the parameters and thresholds upon which an incident is  considered significant as well as the ex post analysis of the reported data, make inventories of  suitable tools available etc. ENISA contributes to ensuring the efficient flow of voluntary  information at MS request and to establish common situational awareness in the event of a large- scale cross-border incident.  ENISA has significant expertise on incident reporting at EU level through the work carried out with  Member States and telecoms providers on the transposition of Article 13a of the 2009 telecommunications  framework directive. ENISA also contributed to the interpretation of Article 19 of the eIDAS regulation and  now helps trust-service providers in implementing this article. ENISA will also monitor the developments of  the EECC and include relative tasks upon approval for the legislation.  Output O.1.2.4 — Regular technical reports on cybersecurity situation (Scenario 2)  As the frequency and magnitude of cybersecurity incidents in the EU increase, the Commission recognised  the need to improve shared situation awareness amongst EU and MS policymakers. In particular, the  Commission requested the following in the blueprint.  ‘As part of the regular cooperation at technical level to support Union situational awareness, ENISA should  on a regular basis prepare the EU cybersecurity technical situation report on incidents and threats, based  on publicly available information, its own analysis and reports shared with it by MS CSIRTs (on a voluntary  basis) or NISD single points of contact, European cybercrime centre (EC3) at Europol and CERT-EU and  where appropriate EU intelligence and situation centre (INTCEN) at the European External Action Service  (EEAS). The report should be made available to the relevant instances of the Council, the Commission, the  High representative of the EU (HR/VP) and the CSIRTs network.  The production of such situation reports will leverage many other existing and future ENISA WP activities.  For this particular output, ENISA will produce a summary report of all EU cybersecurity technical situation  reports produced throughout the year. Pending implementation of the blueprint, ENISA will also organise a  workshop with EU, MS and sectorial stakeholders to present the results and gather feedback on ways to  improve the collection, analysis, presentation and distribution mechanisms of the EU cybersecurity  technical situation reports.  In addition to the above, ENISA will create cyberthreat information reports on a quarterly basis. Such  reports will be in par with ENISA Info notes and are the intermediate reports towards the ETL report, the  end year CTI report. Taken together and under the assumption that this information will be prepared in a  structurally consistent manner, it will comprise a unique open-source CTI. It is expected that such an  offering will significantly enhance the capabilities of organisations with low cybersecurity maturity. And  ENISA programming document 2019-2021  final | December 2018  33  will contribute to them having a better understanding of the threat level and being in a position to better  protect themselves.  ENISA will also support the dissemination of CTI good practices. This will enable stakeholders to better  address CTI in their business, vendors to create usable CTI offerings and tools and governmental  organisations to better engage in CTI brokerage. All this will enable CTI usage and will thus contribute to a  more proper, more agile adaptation to real cyber threats.  Objective 1.3. Research, development and innovation (RDI)  Output O.1.3.1 — Supporting cPPP in establishing priorities for EU research & development  (Scenario 1)  ENISA will continue providing analysis of the areas covered by the NISD, the cybersecurity package, the  Commission decision on cPPP and the outcomes of relevant Horizon2020 projects e.g. the CSA projects  (cyber watching, AEGIS and EU-Unity) and will aim to show where R & D activities funded in the context of  H2020, CEF, Transits and GEANT would achieve the greatest impact. On cybersecurity aspects related to  the GDPR, ENISA will work in conjunction with the respective Commission services. ENISA will monitor and  analyse cybersecurity-related directives and initiatives in various sectors (e.g. space, maritime, defence,  transport, automotive) and assess the specific threat landscape in these critical sectors.  ENISA will work closely with ECSO and cPPP on cybersecurity in order to align the work being carried with  the ENISA work programme. In addition, ENISA will continue to support NAPAC by offering a secretariat  function.  ENISA will look into adapting the current best practice and guidelines for protecting EU systems and  networks, services, IoT and cloud ecosystems and supply chains according to the evolving threats. As well  as building specific use cases that can be adopted by the IT security community.  Additionally, ENISA will continue supporting and advising the Commission and organisations in this area  (e.g. ECSO), other agencies (e.g. EDA, ESA), industrial communities as well as the Member States, to meet  their goals by bringing its concrete NIS policy expertise. Relevant contributions will also be made on the  proposal on the creation of the cybersecurity competence network with a European cybersecurity research  and competence centre (32).  Objective 1.4. Response to Article 14 requests under expertise activity (33)  Output O.1.4.1 — Response to requests under expertise activity (Scenario 1)  Article 14 requests allow the MS and EU institutions alike to make direct requests to ENISA when seeking  assistance or advice on specific activities or policy issues. Under this objective, ENISA will address all the  requests related to its area the area of expertise.  The type of outcome and the performance indicators will be set out during the execution year of the work  programme together with the requester.

(34) Article 13a of the amended Framework Directive 2002/21/EC (2002).  (35) Article 19 of the eIDAS regulation (2014).  ENISA programming document 2019-2021  final | December 2018  36  Activity 2 — Policy. Promote network and information security as an EU policy priority  Objective 2.1. Supporting EU policy development  Output O.2.1.1 — Support the preparatory policy discussions in the area of certification of products  and services (Scenario 1)  Taking due account of recent legislative and policy developments, including the draft cybersecurity act.  ENISA will continue working towards meeting preparatory requirements for the certification framework for  ICT security products and services by e.g. promoting mutual recognition or harmonisation of certification  practices up to a certain level, in line with the proposed act. Any planned activity in the area of  cybersecurity certification will respect existing national efforts and interests as well as the principle that,  wherever possible, decisions must be taken at the level of government closest to citizens (‘subsidiarity’) as  it applies in the area of certification, while taking into consideration the ongoing legislative process.  ENISA will provide support for the Commission and the Member States in the policy area on certification of  products and services within the scope of the approved cybersecurity act and for better preparing for the  new EU cybersecurity-certification framework for products and services. Within this framework ENISA will  enter the final year of preparations in anticipation of the coming into force of the cybersecurity act. ENISA  will subsequently seek to stimulate the interaction and involvement of MS governments as well as public  policy and industry stakeholders in the emerging EU certification framework. Transitioning from policy  preparation to policy implementation in good cooperation with the MS governments is demanding for  ENISA as it is conditional to final approval of the cybersecurity act.  ENISA will provide support for the organisation of the EU cybersecurity-certification framework  (organisational and IT systems), supporting the European Commission in its role in the European  cybersecurity-certification group and analysing aspects of functional equivalence of existing certification  schemes across the EU (at the MS as well as the EU level) with the emerging EU certification framework for  facilitating the transition to the new EU framework. ENISA will continue to interact with key stakeholders  associated with the EU cybersecurity-certification framework.  Objective 2.2. Supporting EU policy implementation  Output O.2.2.1 — Recommendations supporting implementation of the eIDAS regulation  (Scenario 1)  ENISA will continue its work on supporting public and private bodies in implementing the eIDAS regulation  by addressing technological aspects and building blocks for trust services. Aspects to be covered will be  agreed with the Commission and MS through the eIDAS expert group. Interacting with the private sector  will enhance the ability of ENISA to make further meaningful contributions to this area. In implementing  the cybersecurity act, ENISA will support the eID efforts of the MS and the Commission. The eIDAS expert  group will be consulted for approval on specific ENISA implementation guidelines and technical  recommendations addressing operational aspects of trust-service providers, conformity-assessment bodies  and supervisory authorities. ENISA will continue to accumulate experience of best-practice and state-of- the-art progress, seeking to emphasise implementation and interoperability aspects. These  recommendations will complement the existing knowledge base that ENISA created for the trust-service  providers. At the same time, ENISA will take account of recommendations and standards being developed  by CEN/Cenelec, ETSI and the ISO and seek to avoid both duplication of work and potentially opposing  approaches. In this regard, ENISA will support the Commission in assessing the relevant standards by  ENISA programming document 2019-2021  final | December 2018  37  reviewing their meeting of requirements of the eIDAS regulation. Furthermore, ENISA will continue to  support the Commission in the implementation of qualified-website-authentication certificates, in  particular by using them for their webpages. Other relevant areas include the non-qualified level of trust  services, mobile services etc.  Output O.2.2.2 — Supporting the implementation of the work programme of the cooperation group  under the NISD (Scenario 1)  ENISA will leverage its expertise and good practice, among others, on critical information infrastructures,  national cybersecurity strategies, CSIRTs, baseline security requirements and incident notification in  numerous sectors (energy, transport, finance etc.), standardisation, ICT certification and others to  contribute to the work of the cooperation group. That would be by reusing or customising existing results  or by developing new, specific results meeting the needs and requirements of the cooperation group.  ENISA can analyse specific issues identified in the second biennial cooperation group work programme  (2018-2020), consult with MS competent authorities, and develop recommendations and suggestions that  would allow the Commission and Member States to make informed decisions on NIS matters. It could be  useful to use the work carried out on OES, DSPs and other service interdependencies as a reference for the  NIS cooperation group work stream on cross-border dependencies.  ENISA will support the work of the Commission in resourcing capabilities on cybersecurity through CEF  (specifically for the national competent authorities under Objective 4 and for OES and DSP under  Objective 2), under NISD objectives.  ENISA will also take stock of the lessons learned from the first year of implementation of the NISD and  recommend good practices to the cooperation group and the Commission on the directive-transposition  process.  In addition, ENISA will continue its efforts supporting the Commission and MSs with the overview of the  NISD implementation and its evaluation by the Member States and the Commission.  Output O.2.2.3 — Assist MS in the implementation of OES and DSP security requirements  (Scenario 1)  Drawing from the experience of the NIS cooperation group, ENISA will assist MSs in the implementation of  OES and DSP security requirements by building on its knowledge and expertise in the area of security  requirements, identification criteria, security measures and notification requirements. ENISA will work  closely with Member States to identify cost effective practices and mature security frameworks.  In deriving such a set of common mechanisms, sector-specific needs are to be taken into account as these  are likely to introduce different priorities (for example, the relative importance of availability and integrity  is likely to be different in the energy sector from those in the banking sector, where different risks prevail).  ENISA will monitor the development of the NISD implementation (across all sectors in the MSs) and  identify possible priorities and tasks for those involved.  However, ENISA will take note of such specific requirements as and when they are identified during the  analysis phase and will then map them to the needs and requirements of DSPs and OES.  ENISA will also compare and validate the results with other relevant approaches in the area of OES (e.g.  Cybersecuirty Capability Maturity Model (C2M2), NICE Capability Maturity Model (NICE-CMM)) or the  generic IT models (e.g. ISO 27001) and interact with all important stakeholders from public as well as the  ENISA programming document 2019-2021  final | December 2018  38  private sector. In this line, online tools which map the security requirements with different approaches and  standards will be developed.  The proper validation of the proposed practices contribute to setting the basis for sufficient convergence  across the EU MSs. The existence of multiple legislation instruments (e.g. GDPR and sector-specific  legislation) with different security requirements on OES and DSP requires a concerted effort from  competent authorities regarding supervision and good-governance practices. In this light, ENISA will take  stock of existing initiatives addressing this problem and will bring together stakeholders from different  security domains to discuss the findings.  Output O.2.2.4 — Supporting the payment services directive (PSD) implementation (Scenario 1)  The second payment-services directive (PSD II) will revolutionise the finance sector and more specifically  the payments industry. It will affect everything from the way payments are made online, to what  information is sent when making a payment. The transposition of the directive was set as January 2018.  ENISA will continue its support for the European Banking Authority (EBA), the European Central Bank (ECB)  and relevant competent public and private stakeholders to develop guidelines and recommendations for  implementing the directive and explore NISD collaboration.  In this context ENISA will help the relevant authorities with presenting the security requirements and  incident-reporting status for each MS on PSD II implementing the directive in with the use of a web tool.  This work item builds on previous work of ENISA in the area of supporting activities in the NISD (WP 2015- 2017).  Output O.2.2.5 — Contribute to the EU policy in the area of privacy and data protection with policy  input on security measures (Scenario 1)  Within the scope of security measures required by the legal framework on personal data protection and  privacy as well as suitable provisions stemming from the draft cybersecurity act for the role of ENISA in this  area, ENISA will continue promoting trust and security in digital services by means of technical analysis on  the implementation of EU legislation addressing privacy and personal data protection. In particular,  aspects of the technical implementation of the GDPR and of the forthcoming privacy regulation will be  addressed. ENISA will support the implementation of the regulatory aspects related to cybersecurity by  making available policy, technical and organisational advice to the Commission in the area of security of  personal data and privacy confidentiality of communications for implementing security measures.  Moreover, ENISA analysis will discuss aspects of shaping technology according to GDPR and ePrivacy  provisions, such as for example data security, data minimisation, anonymisation and pseudonymisation,  privacy by design and by default, mobile applications as well as aspects of privacy standards.  ENISA will seek to bring together the data protection and privacy considerations on one hand with IT  security considerations in the product and services certification area on the other. ENISA will liaise with  stakeholders and policymakers as well as with competent authorities in the Member States and EU  institutions, to ensure that the network and information-security dimension of data protection and privacy  are considered in the EU while striving for synergies between privacy and security and assistance to key  stakeholders, namely the Commission and competent EU bodies.  Currently in its 7th edition, the Annual Privacy Forum (APF) — a conference that has grown to be cost-free  for ENISA in the last two editions — remains the instrument of choice to bring together key communities,  namely policy, academia and industry, in the broader area of privacy and data protection while focusing on  ENISA programming document 2019-2021  final | December 2018  39  privacy related application areas. Cooperation activities with European Data Protection Supervisor, the  European Data Protection Board and national data protection authorities will be further pursued.  Output O.2.2.6 — Guidelines for the European standardisation in ICT security (Scenario 1)  Building on its own policy work, existing standards and the requirements of the Member States, this  activity will seek to make available a gap analysis and/or provide guidance to implement existing NIS  standards. Additionally, ENISA manages the relationship it has developed with the EU standard-developing  organisations (SDOs) (CEN/Cenelec and ETSI) by contributing to their standardisation work at the strategic  and tactical levels (e.g. by joining the CSCG, observing relevant Technical and Conference programme  Committees etc.). New requirements associated primarily with the implementation and secondly  transposition of the EU legal instruments in place in the Member States will be taken into account,  including aspects of the NISD and the GDPR, as well as preparing for the coming into force of the draft  ePrivacy regulation, and the draft cybersecurity act, etc. This output will seek to analyse the gaps and  provide guidelines for, in particular, the development or repositioning of standards, facilitating the  promulgation and adoption of NIS standards. ENISA brings in this relationship its technical and organisation  NIS know-how which can be further leveraged into standards in extending or assessing them to render  them more appropriate to stakeholders and more compliance with the prevailing regulatory framework.  By bringing in its concrete NIS policy expertise, ENISA will produce ‘how to’ and ‘what else’ guides in an  effort to contribute to European standardisation.  In carrying out this work, ENISA will consult with the Member States, industry and standards developing  organisations (e.g. ETSI, CEN, Cenelec), as well as Commission services and agencies with policy  competence as appropriate.  Output O.2.2.7 — Supporting the implementation of European Electronic Communications  Code (EECC) (Scenario 1)  The proposal for the EECC brings substantial improvements to the security component. Built on the general  objectives such as ensuring a high level of security of networks and services, adapting to technological  changes and ensuring consistency with other regulatory initiatives (GDPR, NISD), the EECC, once adopted, is  expected to bring more harmonisation at EU level and several improvements as regards the security part,  such as the following.   Broadening the scope to include also number-independent (Ni) interpersonal communications  services (ICS) (also called over-the-top services (OTTs)).   A comprehensive design of security (focused on availability, integrity, confidentiality and  authenticity of the data and services), that will result in more types of incidents being reported.   Clear criteria to be taken into account when notifying incidents (e.g. socioeconomic impact).  After its approval, ENISA will provide support for Member States and the industry, so as to assure a proper  and efficient implementation of the new requirements in the EECC. ENISA will engage its Article 13a expert  group and the private sector in order to establish guidelines and good practices that will facilitate the  implementation process. ENISA will also further facilitate the coordination of Member States to avoid  diverging national requirements that may create security risks and barriers to the internal market. ENISA  will closely monitor the development of the EECC and identify tasks and priorities for the concerned actors  accordingly.  ENISA programming document 2019-2021  final | December 2018  40  Output O.2.2.8– Supporting the sectorial implementation of the NISD (Scenario 2)  The key NISD obligations are currently implemented horizontally across all NISD sectors. The proposed  measures, namely incident reporting, security requirements and criteria for identifying OES, cover the  aspects which are common across all sectors. They aim at developing a baseline for all OES.  Sector-specific initiatives will have to use the horizontal obligations of the NISD and customise them to  address the specific needs and requirements of each sector. It is extremely important, at this stage, to  facilitate the sectorial implementation of the NISD in a consistent and consistent way. This way we ensure  proper deployment of horizontal measures within the NISD.  In this outcome ENISA will identify for all NISD sectors relevant public and private initiatives at national and  EU level and assess their maturity. ENISA, in close collaboration with the cooperation group (e.g. based on  widely accepted criteria for the prioritisation of the criticality of essential services) and the expertise of  ENISA in given sectors (e.g. health, transport), will select two NISD sectors in sectorial implementation.  In that context ENISA will work with all relevant stakeholders, public and private, in each sector and  subsector, to identify whether and how to customise the horizontal NISD measures. ENISA will do that by  taking under consideration the sectorial specifications, standards, and existing initiatives/schemes.  ENISA will use its expertise and knowledge developed within the NISD (WP 2016, WP 2017, and WP 2018)  and other CIIP-related activities.  ENISA will work under the cooperation group, with MS experts.  Output O.2.2.9 — Hands on tasks in the area of certification of products and services (Scenario 2)  Having adopted the finally approved cybersecurity act and its component on certification, ENISA will  support the Commission and the Member States by carrying out hands on tasks in this area for assisting  them in deploying the framework.  Transitioning from policy preparation to policy implementation is a demanding action for ENISA and it will  include a framework for certification schemes, a support framework as well as structured interactions with  the stakeholders’ community and the tools required to carry out these functions.  Working in cooperation with MS certification supervisory authorities, the European cybersecurity- certification group and other key stakeholders, ENISA will set the stage for implementation by supporting  the functional equivalence of existing certification schemes across the EU (at the MS as well as the EU  level) with the emerging EU cybersecurity-certification framework for integrating existing schemes in the  new EU framework in a flexible way. ENISA will continue working with stakeholders to collect, establish  and understand expectations they have from the EU cybersecurity-certification framework. ENISA will  implement an action plan in order to fulfil a role in the emerging EU cybersecurity certification framework  for quickly taking up the new tasks emanating from the cybersecurity act along with the Member States.  Practical aspects to be considered include but are not limited to identifying new areas in certification,  recommendations on next steps to take at EU level, analysis of impact of certification for manufacturers,  governments and end-users, recommendations on prioritisation of schemes, review of overlaps and gaps  across proposed schemes etc. Areas for possible cybersecurity-certification schemes include IoT, Consumer  Electronics and Cloud Computing, depending of course on requests received by the designated initiator i.e.  ENISA programming document 2019-2021  final | December 2018  41  MS and the Commission (36). ENISA will carry out support activities in the area of certification and if  needed, it will organise its own events in line with the finally approved cybersecurity act bringing together  key stakeholders. There is also a certain degree of internal preparatory work in IT infrastructure and  organisational preparation including management of third party intellectual property rights that will need  to be sorted out, to duly support the EU framework.  Objective 2.3. Response to Article 14 requests under policy activity (37)  Output O.2.3.1 — Response to requests under policy activity (Scenario 1)  Article 14 requests allow the MS and EU institutions to make direct requests to ENISA seeking assistance or  advice on specific activities. Under this objective, ENISA will address all the requests related to the area of  policy development and policy implementation.  The type of outcome and the performance indicators will be set out during the execution year of the work  programme together with the requester.  Although, by definition, it is not possible to accurately estimate the exact number or the output and  outcome of these requests for 2018, the allocated resources are indicated in the summary section at the  end.

Support Europe maintaining state-of-the-art network and  information-security capacities  Objective 3.1. Assist Member State capacity building  Output O.3.1.1 — Update and provide technical training for MS and EU bodies (Scenario 1)  In 2019 most of the activities in this area target at maintaining and extending the collection of good  practice guidelines and training for CSIRT and other operational personnel. ENISA will support the  development of MS incident-response preparedness by providing good practice guidance on key elements  of NIS capacity building with a focus on CSIRT training and services in order to improve skills of CSIRT  teams and their personnel. ENISA will further build upon successful work in the area of ‘training  methodologies and impact assessment’.  In detail, ENISA will continue to provide an update of the training material, according to the findings of the  stocktaking study for training in NISD sectors and provide a new set of training material based on emerging  technologies in order to improve MS CSIRTs skills and capacities to efficiently manage cybersecurity  events. A special emphasis is placed on supporting MS CSIRTs and EU bodies with concrete advice (like  good practice material) and concrete action (like CSIRT training). ENISA will as well offer, upon their  request, direct support to single Member States to provide technical training and advisories.  In 2019, ENISA will further enhance its methodology, seminars and training on: a) cyber-crisis management  and b) the organisation and management of exercises. This activity will build on the current developed  material and infrastructure for on-site and online training on these subjects. In addition, this activity will  cover the delivery of this training upon request.  Output O.3.1.2 — Support EU MS in the development and assessment of NCSs (Scenario 1)  The NISD sets as priority for the MS to adopt a national NIS strategy and to monitor its implementation.  Since 2017 all 28 MS have published a national NIS strategy. However, in order to align the objectives of  the existing national cybersecurity strategies (NCSs) to the requirements of the NISD, many MS will update  their current NCSs.  ENISA programming document 2019-2021  final | December 2018  44  ENISA will continue assisting EU MS to develop their capabilities in the area of NCSs. ENISA, building on  previous years’ work in this area, will assist MS to deploy existing good practices in the related areas and  offer targeted and focused assistance on specific NCSS objectives (e.g. CIIP, creation of PPPs etc.). A  priority in this area will be to ensure that NCSS adequately reflect the priorities and requirements of the  NISD. Each year ENISA focuses on one of the objectives of the strategy (e.g. collaboration, CIIP,  governance).  ENISA will this year, focus on a new objective trending in the NCSS: innovation and start-ups. This derives  from the need for the private sector to have incentives to invest on cybersecurity. This is widely depicted  in the EU National Cybersecurity strategies as the engagement of the private sector that will pave the way  for a digital single market in the EU and for a strong cybersecurity role at international level. ENISA will  investigate the activities the MS take under this objective and examine best practices and new potential  incentives.  ENISA will continue supporting MS in evaluating and assessing their NCSS, as well as, their NIS initiatives.  ENISA will update its NCSS assessment methodology and will validate it with public and private  stakeholders. Then ENISA will make this assessment methodology available to MS to use and remain at  their disposal should they need assistance in implementing it.  Finally, ENISA will enhance the NCSS map with additional valuable information related to the NISD creating  an information hub. As for the past 5 years, ENISA will organise the annual NCSS workshop focusing  validating the findings of the study.  Output O.3.1.3 — Support EU MS in their incident-response development (Scenario 1)  In 2019 ENISA will concentrate its efforts on assisting MS to support their incident-response capabilities by  providing an updated view on the CSIRT landscape and development in Europe. In close cooperation with  the NISD CSIRTs network, ENISA will support the development of MS incident-response capabilities by  providing recommendations on key dimensions of NIS capability building with a focus on the development  and efficient functioning of national and sectorial CSIRTs. ENISA will as well offer, upon their request,  direct support to single Member States to assess and improve their incident-response capabilities,  including assistance in the preparatory phase of CEF proposals.  The main objectives of this output in 2019 is to help MS and another ENISA’s incident-response  stakeholders, such as the EU institutions, bodies and agencies, to develop, extend and deploy their  incident-response capabilities and services in order to meet the ever growing challenges to secure their  networks. Another objective of this output is to further develop and apply ENISA recommendations for  CSIRT baseline capabilities and maturity framework. As a continuous effort, ENISA will continue supporting  cross-border CSIRT community projects, tools development as well as the global dialogue about common  definitions and maturity framework in the incident-response domain.  Output O.3.1.4 — Support EU MS in the development of ISACs for the NISD Sectors (Scenario 2)  For many years ENISA works closely with the main OES in the EU. It has set up several sectorial expert  groups covering sectors such as maritime, finance and health (38). Through this effort and based on this  experience with sectors or sector-specific topics like ICS/SCADA, ENISA holds a unique position in the EU to  fulfil a key role on EU-focused ISACs. It is a natural role for ENISA and continuation of its activities in the  last 10 years to coordinate, in conjunction with CEF funding, the further development, implementation and  (38) https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/critical-information-infrastructures-and-services  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/critical-information-infrastructures-and-services  ENISA programming document 2019-2021  final | December 2018  45  continuation of EU ISACs in the next decade. ENISA is already cooperating with the Commission in  developing the ISAC facilities manager concept arising from proposals to develop ISACs reference in the  CEF Telecom 2018 work programme (39).  ENISA has been working on the topic of CIIP since 2010, so it would make sense to have a special role in  pan-European sectorial ISAC. Some examples would include:   EU aviation ISAC: ENISA plays a key role in the (further) development of this ISAC. Its added value is  mainly based on the network and the specific expertise in the sector (previous and existing studies). The  members consist of airlines and carriers. ENISA is an associate member.   EU Energy ISAC: ENISA plays a key role in the development and professionalisation of this ISAC. ENISA is  a full member and is responsible for providing expertise through organising webinars and educational  sessions for its members. In September 2017, it hosted the ISAC meeting in Athens. The EE-ISAC  members are preferably, and only, operators.   EU Financial Institutions ISAC: This ISAC is the oldest and ENISA has been actively involved for many  years. It supports the ISAC, for example by hosting the mailing list. ENISA’s involvement is mainly to  legitimise EU participation. ENISA is an observer.   EU Rail ISAC: ENISA is facilitating the European railway operators (infrastructure managers and railway  undertakings) creating the European Rail ISAC. Currently more than 23 European stakeholders and the  European Railway Agency (ERA) participate in the ISAC. ENISA offer experience and support.  The September 2017 Joint Communication states: ‘Some first steps have been taken in respect of specific  critical sectors such as aviation, through the creation of EASA, and energy, by developing ISACs. The  Commission will contribute in full to this approach with support from ENISA, with an acceleration needed in  particular for sectors providing essential services as identified in the NISD’.  ENISA will support MS with the creation of national ISACs through engaging all relevant stakeholders:  national competent bodies, the private sector i.e. OES or manufacturers and other relevant bodies and  through assisting, on request, the development of proposals, by Member State endorsed entities, for  funding through CEF. ENISA will use the opportunity to continue promoting CEF resourcing under the  Telecom Call (Objective 2 supporting OES) to further support OES participating in the ISAC. ENISA will also  explore the possibility of synergies across national ISACs (national ISAC to national ISAC) as well as across EU  sectorial ones. This will help the private companies operating in numerous MS to have increased benefits  from such a collaboration.  Objective 3.2. Support EU institutions’ capacity building.  Output O.3.2.1. Representation of ENISA on the Steering Board of CERT-EU and coordination with  other EU agencies using the CERT-EU service (Scenario 1)  In December 2017, the operations of CERT-EU were formalised by way of a new Interinstitutional  Arrangement. The Members of the Steering Board comprise the participating EU institutions and ENISA  which participates as the representative of EU agencies that use the services of CERT-EU.  In this context ENISA will actively participate in the Steering Board of CERT-EU, liaise with the EU agencies  on operational issues related to CERT-EU’s activities in particular through the ICTAC (ICT Advisory  Committee) of the EU agencies and generally to ensure that the viewpoints of the agencies are adequately  (39) https://ec.europa.eu/inea/en/connecting-europe-facility/cef-telecom/apply-funding/2018-cef-telecom-calls-proposals  https://ec.europa.eu/inea/en/connecting-europe-facility/cef-telecom/apply-funding/2018-cef-telecom-calls-proposals  ENISA programming document 2019-2021  final | December 2018  46  represented. ENISA will also report in to the CERT-EU steering board on the evolution of services required  by the agencies.  Output O.3.2.2. Cooperation with relevant EU bodies on initiatives covering NIS dimension related to  their missions (Scenario 1)  Already since 2017, ENISA has increased its cooperation efforts with a number of EU bodies. Notable  examples are the collaboration with CERT-EU in the context of the WannaCry incident as well as the  cooperation in the context of CyCon between Cyber Europe, Cyber Coalition and Locked Shields, and its  contribution for the preparation of the tabletop exercise conducted in the context of the Estonian  Presidency.  In this context, in 2019 ENISA will intensify its cooperation efforts and liaise with the relevant EU bodies (40)  (including EASA, CERT-EU, EDA — including civil/defence cooperation — etc.).  Objective 3.3. Assist in improving private sector capacity building and general awareness  In close collaboration with Member States and with the private sector, ENISA will help the public to gain  essential cybersecurity knowledge and skills to help protect their digital lives. Aspects like cybersecurity  culture and insurance will be further analysed.  In 2018, activities will include promoting the annual ECSM and working with the Member States delivering  projects like the cybersecurity challenges as well as national initiatives, upon request from Member States.  Output O.3.3.1 — European cybersecurity challenges (ECSC) (Scenario 1)  Both the growing need for IT security professionals and skills shortage are widely acknowledged. To help  solve this, ENISA is supporting national cybersecurity competitions for students, security professionals and  even non-IT professionals, with the goal to find cyber talents and encourage all of them to pursue a career  in cybersecurity.  Thus, in order to promote capacity building and awareness in NIS among youngsters and future cybersecurity  experts in the EU MS, ENISA will continue to promote and advise EU MS on running national ‘Cybersecurity  Challenge’ competitions.  ENISA will also continue to support the planning and development of the ECSC 2019 final. The goal for 2019  will be to further increase the interest in this type of events by promoting excellence in the form of cyber  competitions  Output O.3.3.2 — European cybersecurity month (ECSM) deployment (Scenario 1)  The metrics built into the ECSM- European Cybersecurity Month have shown an increased number of  participants, and a better engagement level from year to year. This was made possible with the support of  a vibrant community. In 2019, ENISA will continue reaching out to Member States and the public alike.  Previously proposed pillars remain: support a multi-stakeholder governance approach; encouraging  (40) Memorandum of Understanding between The European Union Agency for Network and Information Security (ENISA), The European Defence Agency  (EDA), Europol’s European Cybercrime Centre (EC3), The Computer Emergency Response Team for the EU institutions, bodies and agencies (CERT-EU),  available at: https://www.eda.europa.eu/docs/default-source/documents/mou—eda-enisa-cert-eu-ec3—23-05-18.pdf  https://www.eda.europa.eu/docs/default-source/documents/mou---eda-enisa-cert-eu-ec3---23-05-18.pdf  ENISA programming document 2019-2021  final | December 2018  47  common public-private activities; assess the impact of activities, optimising and adapting to new  challenges as appropriate.  Output O.3.3.3 — Support EU MS in cybersecurity skills development (Scenario 2)  In 2019, ENISA will promote a series of new activities in the area of cybersecurity skill development which  will focus on identifying current national and EU-wide initiatives. The main output of this activity will be a  database of existing services and programmes in the EU that aim to enhance cybersecurity skills among EU  public in general, and cybersecurity experts in particular. The 2019 stocktaking exercise will cover  academia, public institutions and private companies. As part of this programme, a skills-development  scheme and maturity model will be established, by taking into account existing and similar frameworks  and initiatives.  Objective 3.4. Response to Article 14 requests under capacity activity (41)  Output O.3.4.1 — Response to requests under capacity activity (Scenario 1)  Article 14 requests allow the MS and EU institutions to make direct requests to ENISA seeking assistance or  advice on specific activities. Under this objective, ENISA will address all the requests related to the area of  capacity building.  The type of outcome and the performance indicators will be set out during the execution year of the work  programme together with the requester.  Although, by definition, it is not possible to accurately estimate the exact number or the output and  outcome of these requests for 2018, the allocated resources are indicated in the summary section at the  end.

Foster the emerging European network and information- security community  Objective 4.1. Cyber-crisis cooperation  Output O.4.1.1 — Planning of cyber Europe 2020 and cyber SOPEx (Scenario 1)  In 2020, ENISA will organise the fifth pan-European cyber exercise, Cyber Europe 2020 (CE2020). In 2019  ENISA will prepare the plan of CE2020. This exercise will closely follow up and build upon the lessons  learned and actions from previous exercises, such as CE2018.  CE2020 will focus on testing capabilities and procedures, namely large-scale incident management  cooperation procedures at EU and national-levels. The crisis escalation scenario will be realistic and  focused in order to capture better how incidents are managed and cooperation happens in real life. The  exercise will include explicit scenarios for the CSIRTs network, single points of contact and competent  authorities set up under the NISD, including focusing on one or more of the essential sectors. Also there  will be designs to exercise the various aspects of the cyber-crisis-collaboration blueprint. Depending on the  availability of resources in 2020 ENISA will also enhance the observer role (introduced in 2018) striving to  make best use of observers.  The high-level exercise programme brief will include the strategic dimensions of the exercise will be  prepared based on the lessons learned from CE2018, to drive the whole planning process. The exercise  brief will be given for comments and approval to ENISA’s MB after consultation with the MS Cooperation  Group and the CSIRTs network set up under the NISD. Following this ENISA will assemble group of planners  from the participating countries to work closely towards developing a detailed exercise plan (ExPlan) in  2019. ENISA will involve the group of planners in the relevant planning steps and take into account their  input towards a consented plan. The exercise planning will avoid overlaps with other major related  activities.  ENISA will consult MS and seek agreement of ENISA’s MB after consultation with the cooperation group  and the CSIRTs network set up under the NISD on a possible joint EU-NATO cyber exercise in the coming  year.  Finally, in 2019 ENISA will organise the Cyber SOPEx exercise (formerly known as EuroSOPEx) for the EU  public authorities’ points of contact, as these will be represented in the CSIRTs network only to keep and  even raise the momentum of cooperation in between them. As in previous years the exercise will be  planned with the support of representatives from the involved organisations. The exercise is expected  again to have as high-level goals to raise awareness of cooperation procedures, train participants in using  the cooperation infrastructures, such as the communication and information sharing and ultimately  contribute to increase trust within the CSIRTs network. Guidance should be found in the CSIRTs network on  planning the exercise. There will not be any private entities involved in this exercise.  ENISA programming document 2019-2021  final | December 2018  50  Output O.4.1.2 — Support activities for cyber exercises (Scenario 1)  Since 2014 ENISA started the development of the cyber exercise platform (CEP). CEP hosts a number of  services that ENISA offers to the Member States and EU institutions, such as: exercise organisation and  management, exercise playground with technical incidents, map of exercises and hosting the exercise  development community. In the interests of efficiency, ENISA will seek to align the CEP with the  MeliCERTes facility so that cyber exercises can be integrated in the main operational cooperation platform  under the CSIRTs network.  In addition, new content and exercise incident challenges and material will be developed in order to keep  up the interest of the stakeholders and make CEP a central tool in cybersecurity exercising for all  stakeholders. The CEP platform opens new opportunities for ENISA to enlarge the user base and thus offer  to the operational cybersecurity communities opportunities to exercise and gain experience and  knowledge. One way to develop such exercise incident material will be through the engagement of the  experts’ community.  Finally, following up on possible requests for support by competent authorities, EU bodies and other  relevant organisations to plan and setup technical cyber exercises (CTEx), or other types of exercises,  utilising the technical incidents and the gaming infrastructure in the CEP.  Output O.4.1.3 — Support activities for cyber-crisis management (Scenario 1)  Since 2015, ENISA offers the secretariat to the MS developing EU-level standard cooperation procedures,  which formed the basis of the CSIRTs network SOPs. ENISA will continue to support Member States in the  implementation of the cyber-crisis-collaboration blueprint. In particular, ENISA will further support the  maintenance of the CISRT network SOPs.  The 2016 Communication ‘Strengthening Europe’s Cyber Resilience System and Fostering a Competitive  and Innovative Cybersecurity Industry’ encouraged Member States to make the most out of the NISD  cooperation mechanisms and to enhance cross-border cooperation related to preparedness for a large- scale cyber incident.  The 2017 blueprint called for the establishment of ‘practical implementation guidelines as regards the  integration of their national crisis management and cybersecurity entities and procedures into existing EU  crises management mechanisms, namely the Integrated Political Crisis Response (IPCR) and European  External Action Service Crisis Response Mechanism (EEAS CRM). In particular, Member States should  ensure that appropriate structures are in place to enable the efficient flow of information between their  national crisis management authorities and their representatives at EU level in the context of EU crisis  mechanisms’.  In this light, ENISA will support individual Member States in setting up, improving and testing their own  cyber-crisis management frameworks in order to ensure a smooth adoption of the blueprint and to foster  synergies in crisis management practices across Member States. ENISA will support the cross-border  cooperation between Member States, relevant authorities and facilitate the engagement with the crisis  management framework at national and EU level. Activities offered will range from remote training on  crisis management and public affairs handling, on-site workshops, document revision and tabletop  exercises, including opportunities in CE2020 for testing national crisis management structures.  Last, building upon the after action report from Cyber Europe 2018 and in an effort to improve crisis  management practices at sectorial level, ENISA will draft a report on cyber-crisis management practices in  the aviation sector.  ENISA programming document 2019-2021  final | December 2018  51  Output O.4.1.4 — Supporting the implementation of the information hub (Scenario 2)  Decision-supporting intelligence in the cybersecurity domain is scarce, despite today’s security information  overload (42). ENISA is at the crossroads of most if not all public-private, cross-sector cybersecurity  communities in Europe, from the technical to the strategic level. As indicated in the Commission  communication on building strong cybersecurity for the EU (43), ENISA serves as ‘the focal point for  information and knowledge in the cybersecurity community’. As a result, ENISA is in a unique position to  leverage its network to gather information, process it and foster timely, tailored and highly relevant  situational awareness to support decision-making in both the public and the private European sectors, as  recommended by the Commission in the blueprint:  ‘As part of the regular cooperation at technical level to support European Union situational awareness,  ENISA should on a regular basis prepare the EU cybersecurity technical situation report on incidents and  threats, based on publicly available information, its own analysis and reports shared with it by MS CSIRTs  (on a voluntary basis) or NISD single points of contact, European cybercrime centre (EC3) at Europol and  CERT- EU and where appropriate the EU intelligence and situation centre at the EEAS. The report should be  made available to the relevant instances of the Council, the Commission, the HRVP and the CSIRTs  network’.  In order to support the drafting of these reports and process meaningfully the massive inputs they require,  ENISA has developed in 2018 a prototype to perform automatic classification of documents as well as  simple automatic generation of reports by applying Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning  techniques. This prototype is the first brick of a toolset meant to assist in the development of EU  cybersecurity situation reports, supporting a steady increase and offering guarantees in production time,  quality and consistency.  For this particular output, ENISA will leverage the experience gained in drafting EU Cybersecurity Technical  Situation Reports with the prototype to further develop the Natural Language Processing features in order  for the tool to transition from paragraph-based proposals to the production of meaningful sentences.  Similarly, this experience will be leveraged to further develop the Machine Learning algorithms of the  prototype to allow for a significant increase in number and type of information sources.  Output O.4.1.5 — Supporting the implementation of the cyber-crisis-collaboration blueprint  (Scenario 2)  ENISA will support EU institutions in the implementation of the cyber-crisis-collaboration blueprint. As  specified in the blueprint: ‘The EU cybersecurity crisis response framework should in particular identify the  relevant […]EU institutions […]at all necessary levels — technical, operational, strategic/political and  develop, where necessary, standard operating procedures that define the way in which these cooperate  within the context of EU crisis management mechanisms. Emphasis should be placed on enabling the  exchange of information without undue delay and coordinating the response during large-scale  cybersecurity incidents and crises.’  In particular, ENISA will assist the Commission and the Member States in further developing bilateral and  multilateral procedures for cyber-crisis cooperation with:  (42) Scott J., Spaniel D.

ENISA will drive working groups to initiate or further develop these procedures in the context of the  blueprint, from establishing emergency directories and update processes to structuring cooperation  activities during crises. This is what the blueprint calls as priorities.  ENISA will assist Member States to engage EU cybersecurity crisis response framework with national  cybersecurity crisis response frameworks.  Furthermore, upon request or emerging needs, ENISA will organise workshops and/or tabletop exercises to  validate that these procedures allow for the exchange of information without undue delay, before their  use either in real life or in larger exercises such as Cyber Europe.  Objective 4.2. CSIRT and other NIS community building  Output O.4.2.1 — EU CSIRTs network secretariat and support for EU CSIRTs network community  building (Scenario 1)  ENISA will continue its support to the Commission and Member States in the implementation of the NISD,  in particular in the area of CSIRTs. As part of this activity, ENISA will continue its tasks as the secretariat of  the CSIRTs network and actively support its functioning by suggesting ways to improve cooperation and  trust building among CSIRTs. ENISA will also support this cooperation by developing and providing  guidance and good practices in the area of operational community efforts, such as on information  exchange and secure communication, on request by the members of the CSIRTs network. In particular,  ENISA will be proactive in stimulating discussions within the network and will aim to provide content to  support discussions on policy and technical initiatives according to the CSIRTs network own work  programme (action plan -midterm goals and objectives).  In addition, ENISA will take an active role to support CSIRTs in the CSIRTs network in activities relevant to  the CEF work programme. ENISA will actively support teams in testing and use of the CSP cooperation  mechanism for CSIRTs, known as MeliCERTes of the cybersecurity DSI.  Trust is an important asset for CSIRT operations therefore ENISA will continue to improve the level of trust  in the network by providing trust building exercises and events in coordination with the CSIRTs network  governance.  ENISA will further improve, develop and secure the CSIRTs network infrastructure for its member’s smooth  collaboration and administration use (CSIRTs network portal and other communication means).  ENISA programming document 2019-2021  final | December 2018  53  Output O.4.2.2 — Support the fight against cybercrime and collaboration between CSIRTs and law  enforcement (Scenario 1)  In 2019, ENISA will continue supporting the cooperation between the CSIRT and the law-enforcement  communities and the extensions that this collaboration may have to the judiciary. ENISA will continue its  effort to support the EU-wide objective on fight against cybercrime and continue liaising with various  stakeholders at EU (e.g. Europol and possibly Eurojust), as well as with select stakeholders at MS level.  In particular, in 2019 ENISA will collect input from key stakeholders and prepare a roadmap to further  enhance the cooperation between the CSIRTs and the law enforcement along with their interaction with  the judiciary. The roadmap will not necessarily be made public; it is likely to be distributed instead to select  stakeholders. In addition, ENISA will co-organise together with Europol/EC3 the annual workshop for  national and governmental CSIRTs and their LEA counterparts.  Output O.4.2.3 — Supporting the implementation and development of MeliCERTes platform  (Scenario 1)  By the end of 2019, ENISA will take over the central component of MeliCERTes, which is destined to be the  primary collaboration platform between participating Member States CSIRTs and which is oriented to  enlarge EU MS preparedness, cooperation and coordination to effectively respond to emerging cyber  threats as well as to cross-border incidents. ENISA will also work together with the Commission to set out  (a) the extent of support for the implementation of MeliCERTes running in the CSIRTs premises and (b) the  support for the maintenance of the underlying codebase of the MeliCERTes system. Based on this work,  we will establish corresponding procedures and service level agreement (SLAs) for the support and work  with the Commission to ensure that the code base is correctly supported. In particular ENISA with the  endorsement of the Commission will lead on the development and finalisation of a sustainable governance  arrangement for MeliCERTes with the enabling legal requirements for the participating Member States.  ENISA also will support the work of the Commission in resourcing capabilities on cybersecurity through CEF  calls under the objectives of the NISD, including assistance in the preparatory phase of CEF proposals  related with the support of MeliCERTes platform.  Due to the sensitivity of the data and the level of trust required by our stakeholders, special care and  diligence is needed in order to correctly plan, deploy, administrate and maintain the different systems  related with MeliCERTes platform, therefore high standards of security must be reached in order to  provide internal and external secure operation capabilities, continuous integration of the software and  support to users.  During 2019, ENISA will deploy different systems and processes with the aim of being able to support,  maintain and develop the platform and related activities, including collaboration, involvement and  alignment on cyber exercises and on the CSIRTs network.

ENISA programming document 2019-2021  final | December 2018  56  Activity 5 — Enabling. Improve ENISA’s impact  Objective 5.1. Management and compliance  Management  The executive director is responsible for the overall management of ENISA. The executive director has a  personal assistant.  To support the executive director, the, MB secretariat will continue the administration of the MB meetings  and the administrative correspondence that takes place between meetings, including the management of  the MB portal. In 2019, MB secretariat will continue to support the MB and the executive board in their  functions by providing secretariat assistance.  In relation to the MB, following the applicable rules, one or two (Scenario 2) ordinary meetings will be  organised during 2019 and informal meetings will be held as necessary. The MB portal will be supported  for EB and MB. In relation to the executive board, one formal meeting will be organised per quarter and  informal meetings when necessary.  The resources department (RD) oversees a variety of programmes, projects and services on the overall  management of ENISA, supporting the executive director Decision is areas as personnel, finance,  communications, press, purchasing, technology, facilities management, health, safety, security, protocol,  liaison with local authorities, etc.  The aim of the RD is to provide this assurance and at the same time provide the best level of efficiency and  use of the resources that are made available for ENISA. This also includes coordination with the European  Commission Internal Audit Service (IAS), European Court of Auditors (ECA), European Ombudsman,  European Commission, European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF), DG Human Resources and Security, DG Budget,  DG Communications Networks, Content and Technology, etc. All internal policies related to transparency,  anti-fraud policy, whistle-blowers protection, declarations of interests, etc. are addressed within this  activity.  RD strives to maintain and increase the efficiency and effectives of ENISA, and provide continuous  contribution to the ENISA strategy both internally and externally seeking the optimal solutions for  delivering on the mandate of ENISA and provide the required assurance in compliance.  The aim is to enable ENISA with adequate and modern procedures and tools to minimise the resources  across ENISA maximising the intended delivery of the work programme and statutory commitments.  The core operations department (COD) coordinates the delivery of the core activities of ENISA. As such,  the main role of the COD is to deliver activities A1-A4 of this work programme. The COD also includes the  policy office and the public affairs team and the support of the permanent stakeholders group (PSG) and  national liaison officers (NLO) network is also carried out within COD.  Policy office  Through the policy office, ENISA initiates and further develops strategic cooperation with relevant  stakeholders active in cybersecurity community. For instance, ENISA engages in policy and strategy  discussions with political and policy decision-makers (by participating or organising e.g. MEP breakfasts).  ENISA programming document 2019-2021  final | December 2018  57  Furthermore ENISA engages and further develops strategic relationships with e.g. specific industry sectors  at decision-making level, and identifies the strategic issues on cybersecurity. Some of the results of these  activities of the policy office are published as opinion papers on ENISA webpage. Besides these activities,  more details of the activities delivered by policy office and Public Affairs team are detailed in Objective 5.2  Engagement with stakeholders and international activities.  Quality management is part of the policy office. ENISA implements a quality management system (QMS) to  support its regulatory and strategic goals by means of a quality management approach. The methodology  is based on the plan-do-check-act (PDCA) cycle, documented in a dedicated SOPs and applied accordingly.  Planning activities of ENISA, including single programming document preparation and work programme  coordination are part of policy office list of tasks.  Public affairs team  The public affairs team (PAT) is responsible for coordinating all activities with the media and press,  including press releases, news items and interviews. The PAT team also plays a major role in supporting  events attended by ENISA, ensuring that ENISA is well represented from a public affairs perspective, that  appropriate publicity material is available and, where appropriate, that booths are arranged and  supported.  Internal control  ENISA is aiming implement the new Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission  (COSO) framework 2013 as well as its new requirements in order to be align with the European  Commission.  The exercise will include the adoption of this framework by the MB as well as the assessment of the  compliance of these internal controls.  Internal Control reviews and evaluates risk management, governance and internal control processes of  ENISA, in order to provide, to the Senior Management, executive director and the MB, independent and  objective assurance.  IT  ENISA has launched a project that will run during the second half of 2018 in order to assess information- security risks and determine missing or out of date IT operational procedures. The project will provide a  roadmap and the changes needed in order to mitigate the identified risks. IT Advisory Committee has  decided that data the development of a datacentre recovery site is absolutely necessary in order to  enhance the IT service availability.  By end of 2019 it is expected that all business applications will be securely available on the most widely  used mobile devices. By this timeframe the platform consolidation should be complete and mature, with  adequate, flexible and advance reporting and monitoring tools. Is expected that 2018 will consolidate the  support technology in ENISA with modern, adequate and flexible business applications.  IT is supporting the implementation of a Stakeholders Relationship Management application that will  support the overall stakeholder’s management, communications and internal information sharing. This  application also involves an effective event management platform and internal case management to be  used as service internal client support for requests.  ENISA programming document 2019-2021  final | December 2018  58  Finance, accounting and procurement  The key objective is to ensure the compliance of the financial resources management within the applicable  rules, and in particular with the principle of sound financial management (namely the principles of  effectiveness, efficiency and economy) as set down in the financial regulation. The accounting principles  are followed in order to ensure that financial statements are presented in a manner that is relevant,  reliable, comparable and understandable. Furthermore, ENISA continues its good practice to close  accounts and process payments within the time frame.  ENISA continues the deployment of tools used to simplify and automate its work in the area of budget,  finance and procurement. Further development of in-house systems is expected in the future years to  improve the utilisation of resources, to have a better overview of all financial and procurement processes,  to provide better reporting and a high-level transparency. Internal policies will be revised to ensure that  they are up to date with the financial regulation and procurement rules, but also to implement a clear  guidance for internal use and optimise the available resources.  By mid-2019 an analysis will be made on the cost efficiency of outsourcing activities versus services  received. The aim is to reduce costs and streamline processes in order to achieve a high support level  towards ENISA. The unit strives to minimize the numbers of budget transfers during the year, having  planned and justified carry-overs.  Human resources  The ultimate goal of HR is to attract, select, develop and retain highly qualified staff, to put in place optimal  organisational structures, to promote a safe working environment, to create a culture that reflects ENISA’s  vision and values in which staff can give their best in achieving the organisation’s objectives.

This  includes dealing with matters such as contracts, procurement, employment related matters, data  protection and corporate governance matters. The Legal Affairs function also includes dealing with  complaints to the European Ombudsman and representing ENISA before the European Court of Justice,  General Court or Civil Service Tribunal.  Data Protection Compliance tasks and Data protection Office  The main tasks of the Data Protection Officer (DPO) include (46) the following.   Inform and advise ENISA of its obligations as provided in the applicable legal provisions for the  protection of personal data and document this activity and the responses received.   Monitor the implementation and application of ENISA’s policies in relation to the protection of  personal data and the applicable legal framework for data protection.   Monitor the implementation and application of the applicable legal framework for the protection  of personal data at ENISA, including the requirements for data security, information of data  subjects and their requests in exercising their rights..  (45) ENISA reduced its staffing in 2018 in full compliance with the Art.27 of Interinstitutional Agreement of 02 December 2013 (2013/C 373/01) on 5 % staff  cut.  (46) The tasks of the DPO are explicitly mandated in Regulation (EU) 2018/1725 of the European Parliament and of the  Council of 23 October 2018 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data by the  Union institutions, bodies, offices and agencies and on the free movement of such data, and repealing Regulation (EC) No  45/2001 and Decision No 1247/2002, available at: https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal- content/EN/TXT/?uri=uriserv:OJ.L_.2018.295.01.0039.01.ENG&toc=OJ:L:2018:295:TOC'  https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=uriserv:OJ.L_.2018.295.01.0039.01.ENG&toc=OJ:L:2018:295:TOC https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=uriserv:OJ.L_.2018.295.01.0039.01.ENG&toc=OJ:L:2018:295:TOC  ENISA programming document 2019-2021  final | December 2018  60   Monitor the documentation, notification and communication of personal data in the context of  ENISA’s operations.   Act as ENISA’s contact point for EDPS on issues related to the processing of personal data;  cooperate and consult with EDPS whenever needed.  Information security coordination  The information security officer coordinates the information security management system on behalf of the  authorising officer. In particular, the ISO advises the ICT Unit to develop and implement information- security policies, standards, guidelines and baselines that seek to secure the confidentiality, integrity and  availability of the information systems of ENISA. The ISO is instrumental in incident handling and incident  response and security event monitoring. The ISO also leads the security training for ENISA’s staff and he  provides security guidance on all IT projects, including the evaluation and recommendation of technical  controls. In 2019 the ISO will contribute to such goals as:   Developing assurance frameworks to demonstrate ongoing improvement of the information  security management system. This includes:  o developing KPIs.   Monitoring and reporting the following to IT advisory committee:  o KPI results  o incidents identified and managed  o non-compliances with policy identified and addressed.   Improving the security posture of ENISA by planning penetration tests and vulnerability  assessments.   Advising on security policies and updating existing ones in line with the evolution of threats and  risks.   Improving the internal security training for ENISA staff.   Implementing new systems and tools that can support improvements on information security.  Objective 5.2. Engagement with stakeholders and international activities  Stakeholders communication and dissemination activities  In 2019, ENISA will continue its efforts to improve its focus on key activities and engage the higher possible  number of stakeholders. This includes the various groups of stakeholders that count with institutional,  academia, industry, the public, etc. In its engagement with the stakeholders, ENISA is guided by principles  as balanced representation, openness, transparency and inclusiveness.  Dissemination and Outreach  ENISA will continue developing various tools and channels including the website and with strong emphases  in social media. Dissemination activities are the responsibility of the Stakeholders Communication team  that will seek the appropriate level of outreach activities to take ENISA´s work to all interested and to  provide added value to Europe.  ENISA´s image of quality and trust is paramount for all stakeholders. It is indubitable the importance that  all areas of our society trust in ENISA´s work. The cybersecurity challenges are increasing in the world and  Europe is not an exception. With this objective ENISA´s image needs to be continuously reinforced. The  outreach of ENISA work is essential to create the NIS culture across the several actors in Europe. ENISA is  consistent of this fact and will work with all interested to reach the people that require information about  the work that is developed by ENISA.  ENISA programming document 2019-2021  final | December 2018  61  Several activities are planned in several Member States that will engender the cybersecurity awareness  across Europe, fulfilling ENISA´s mandate, mission and strategy until 2020.

The PSG is composed of ‘nominated members’ and members appointed ‘ad personam’. The total number  of members is 33 and they come from all over Europe. These members constitute a multidisciplinary group  deriving from industry, academia and consumer organisations and are selected upon the basis of their own  specific expertise and personal merits. Three (3) ‘nominated members’ represent national regulatory  authorities, data protection and law-enforcement authorities.  The PSG is established by the ENISA Regulation (EU) No 526/2013. The MB, acting on a proposal by the  executive director, sets up a PSG for a term of office of 2.5 years.  A new PSG was elected in 2017.The Role of the PSG group is to advise the executive director on the  development of ENISA’s work programme, and on ensuring the communication with the relevant  stakeholders on all related issues.  National liaison officer network  ENISA in 2017 has kicked off various activities aiming at strengthening the cooperation with its NLO  network. These activities were continued and were further prepared in 2018. NLOs are key actors for  ENISA programming document 2019-2021  final | December 2018  62  ENISA’s daily work and they warrant the interaction with select public sector entities in the MS while they  provide assurance in outreach, effective liaison with the MS and dissemination of ENISA deliverables.  ENISA will build upon these activities and strength its cooperation with the NLO network, as the first point  of contact for ENISA in the MS, with emphasis on:   NLO meetings to discuss possible improvements in the collaboration with ENISA and input on  selected ENISA projects. Improvements aim at leveraging on the NLO network for the  dissemination of ENISA’s work to the EU Member States and EFTA countries.   The members of the NLO network will continue to receive information on ENISA deliverables,  upcoming ENISA project related tenders, news, working groups entailing requests for identification  of experts in the MS, vacancy notices, and events organised by ENISA or where ENISA contributes  to (for example co-organiser, etc.) as well as time-critical information.   ENISA maintaining and sharing with the NLO network information on all relevant ENISA projects  and activities (e.g. unit responsible for the project, relevant tender results, etc.) while maintaining  and expanding as appropriate online resources available.  Additionally, guidelines provided by the MB on missions, objectives and functioning of the NLO network  will guide the development of this important tool for ENISA for community building.  International relations  Under the executive director’s guidance and initiative, ENISA will seek to strengthen contacts at an  international level  ENISA should participate in international cybersecurity fora such as the OECD, ICANN, IGF in so far as these  groups are discussing items related to our work programme or strategy.   Acting within its mandate, ENISA will develop contacts with important cybersecurity bodies  outside the EU where synergies are beneficial to the EU cybersecurity programme. An example is  NIST, which plays an important role in the implementation of the US Executive Order.   Starting 2018 ENISA will follow standards development and certification initiatives at the  international level, as some of the issues to be solved in the EU have international scope (notably  common criteria certification).   ENISA will follow the development of relevant subjects at the international level in order to align  EU activities with other global players. An example here is provided by the work that ITU is doing  with CSIRTs, which needs to be aligned and will create added value and harmonisation to all.   ENISA staff will attend international conferences on an ‘as needed’ basis. For instance, the  Meridian Conference is the main CIIP conference of the year and the FIRST conference plays the  same role for CERTs.   The ED should attend international conferences in order to enhance ENISA visibility.  ENISA programming document 2019-2021  final | December 2018  63  List of outputs: work programme 2019  As explained in the introduction, this document covers two scenarios, depending on the adoption and  publication of the cybersecurity act.

Overview of the past and current situation.  WP 2019 is following the COM guidelines and MB decisions. The work programme is structured following  the objectives and the priorities of ENISA as described in the ENISA strategy.  ENISA’s budget: the variations between the years 2017 and 2018 is neutral. The budget remained with the  same amount aligned with COM communications.  In 2018 a slight increase in the title II was adopted. In 2019, the budget of Title III was optimised in order to  increase the budget in operations.  As already presented, in the preparation of work programme 2019, ENISA is considering two scenarios. In  detail, Scenario 1, uses the resources available in MFF 2014-2020 (COM(2013)519). Scenario 2, (which  assumes new regulation in place by latest mid-2019), adds new tasks and activities as proposed in the  Cybersecurity Act COM(2017)477, using resources planned in the draft general budget of the European  Union for the financial year 2019 (48).  In case of adoption of the European Commission’s proposal for ENISA’s new mandate COM(2017) 477  Final, all Titles will be increased in order to deliver the proposals of the new mandate.  The human and financial resources of past and current situation are presented in the Annexes of this  document.  Resource programming for the years 2019-2021  The distribution of budget and resources for 2019 for the activities A1 to A5 is presented in the charts at  the end of this section. The budget and resources for each activity are presented in Annex A.1.3. The  budget and posts distribution is based on the activity-based budgeting (ABB) methodology of ENISA  detailed in Annex A.1.3 of this document.  Following the publication of the NIS Directive (NISD), ENISA is re-allocating budget and resources to the  new tasks/activities provisioned for ENISA in the directive. Another area which will probably require more  budget /resources is the cybersecurity public-private partnership (cPPP). However, the impact on the  ENISA work programme has not yet been quantified. This will be updated in future versions as any other  relevant change in the ENISA scope and tasks.

Improvements in order to gain in effectiveness and efficiency  were developed. ENISA perform an internal check in relevance and optimisation of workflows, procedures  and rules, to seek optimisation and efficiency. As an example the so-called paperless, (electronic workflow  IT tool) which routes documents to staff involved in preparation, review and approval of all kinds of work- related documents and transactions represents a huge improvement and cost savings in all processes of  ENISA.  Moreover, the RD applies a strict policy on ratio between administrative support and coordination staff  and operational staff as methodology set by the European Commission and benchmarking exercise within  the institutions and EU agencies. In 2017, only 20.24 % of administrative support and coordination staff  were populating ENISA having in mind that the benchmarking of the EU Commission accept level up to  25 % of this group.  Job type 2017 2016  Total administrative support and Coordination 20.24 % 19.04 %  Administrative support 16.67 % 15.47 %  Coordination 3.57 % 3.57 %  Total operational 65.48 % 66.66 %  Top operational coordination 7.14 % 7.14 %  General operational 58.33 % 59.52 %  Total neutral 14.29 % 14.29 %  Finance and control  14.29 %  14.29 %  In addition, this version of the work programme takes account of the prioritisation exercise carried out  during the consultation with the MB. Certain activities had to be removed from the work programme as  there are not enough resources for the year 2018. Such de-prioritise activities are the following.   Activities to support a digital single market for high-quality NIS products and services.   Support the assessment of existing policies/procedures/practices on NIS within EU institutions.   Planning and organisation of EuroSOPEx 2018.  For years 2019-2021, ENISA will gradually increase the share of the activity 2, policy if more resources  become available.  The budget and resources allocations within the summary tables and Annexes in Scenario 1 are in line with  the COM(2013)519. The budget and resources allocations within the summary tables and Annexes in  Scenario 2 are in line with the proposed additional resources and budget in the draft general budget of the  European Union for the financial year 2019 (49).

ABB focuses on integrated budgeting and financial  management, based on activities linked to ENISA’s priorities and objectives.  To improve better estimation of resources needed for each ENISA activity, we need to split the budget  forecast in Direct and Indirect budget. The following assumptions are used in the simplified ABB  methodology:   Direct budget is the cost estimate of each operational activity (listed in activities A1 to A5) in  goods and services procured.   Indirect budget is the cost estimate of salaries, mission costs and overhead costs, attributable to  each operational or compliance activity. The indirect budget is redistributed against direct budget  in all activities.  ENISA programming document 2019-2021  final | December 2018  69   Compliance posts from Activity A5 Enabling are redistributed to Core activities — A1 to A4, and  operational posts of the Activity A5.   Total ABB posts (FTEs) are the sum of all the posts from all activities (A1 to A5) after the re- distribution.  The table below presents the allocation of financial and human resources to activities of ENISA based on  the above ABB methodology.   Scenario 1 is in line with the COM(2013)519.   Scenario 2 is in line with proposed additional resources and budget in the draft general budget of  the European Union for the financial year 2019 (50).

In 2017, ENISA demonstrated a commitment rate of 99.99 %, of C1 appropriation of the year at the  year end (31/12). The consumption of the 2017 budget at year end shows the capacity of the ENISA to  fully implement its annual appropriations. The same commitment rate achieved in 2010, 2011, 2012,  2013, 2014, 2015, 2016 and 2017, is maintained for an eight year in a row. The payment rate reached  88.19 % and the amount carried forward to 2018 is EUR 1 411 440.51, representing 13.30 % of total C1  appropriations 2017.   Cancellation of Payment Appropriations for the year  No payment appropriations were cancelled.   Cancellation of Payment Appropriations carried over  (Fund source ‘C8’ — appropriations carried over automatically from 2016 to 2017.)  The appropriations of 2016 carried over to 2017 were utilised at a rate of 90.61 % (automatic carry- overs) which indicates a satisfactory capability of estimation of needs. From EUR 968 198.32 carried  forward, EUR 90 916.34 was cancelled, due to the fact that the estimated expenditure deviated from  the actual paid amount. This cancellation represent 0.87 % of the total budget.

ENISA programming document 2019-2021  final | December 2018  79  Annex IV: Human resources — Qualitative  A. Recruitment policy  Statutory staff  ENISA continues to enhance the management of selection procedure with a focus on improving time to  hire, developing good practices in recruitment (e.g. Conflict of Interest assessment for candidates being  recruited in line with Articles 11 and 11a of the SR/Articles 11 and 81 of Conditions of Employment of  Other Servants of the European Union (CEOS)) and streamlining processes. The acquisition of a modern e- recruitment tool from another EU agency would definitively help.  ENISA is also investing in the development of an HR strategic approach focusing on competency-based  interview’s questions, tailor-made training for selection-board members, alignment of competencies  across the organisation per job profile, targeted recruitment procedures for specialised profiles,  transversal recruitment procedures where reserve lists could be used for filling vacant positions across all  departments/Units, specific dissemination of ENISA’s job vacancies, etc.  The job family and job category framework is being consolidated in line with the Annex I of the SR:  Assistant job family   Assistant job category (staff carrying out administrative, technical activities such as assistance  and/or secretariat requiring a certain degree of autonomy): typically, these posts are filled by grades  SC 1-SC 2, AST 1-AST 3, FG I, FG II.   Technical Assistant Job Category (staff providing support with a medium degree of autonomy in the  drafting of documents and assistance in the implementation of policies/projects/  procedures/processes): typically, these posts are filled by grades AST 4-AST 7, FG III.   Senior assistant job category (staff carrying out administrative, technical activities requiring high  degree of autonomy and carrying out significant responsibilities in staff management, budget  implementation or coordination): typically, these posts are filled by grades AST 7-AST 11 and only  for the two Assistants to Head of departments by FG IV.  Operational job family   Junior officer/administrator job category (staff providing junior expertise in a specific field of  knowledge): typically, these posts are filled by grades AD 5, FG IV 13.   Officer/administrator job category (staff providing officer expertise in a specific field of knowledge):  typically, these posts are filled by grades AD 6-AD 7, FG IV 14-18.   Lead officer/administrator (staff providing top level expertise in a specific field of knowledge):  typically, these posts are filled by grades AD 8-AD 9.   Team leader job category (staff providing operational excellence with some managerial  responsibilities): typically, these posts are filed by grades AD 7-AD 10, FG IV 14-18.  Managerial job family   Middle manager job category (staff providing operational vision and managerial expertise including  financial management): typically, these posts are Head of Unit positions filled by grades AD 9-AD 12.   Senior manager job category (staff providing strategical vision and managerial expertise including  financial expertise): typically, these posts are Head of Department position (filled by grades AD 11- AD 13).  ENISA programming document 2019-2021  final | December 2018  80   Executive director (filled by grades AD 14-15).  Following the 2014 SR reform, ENISA adopted and is applying the new implementing rules on the  engagement and use of temporary staff for agencies (TA 2f), thus ensuring a more consistent staff policy and  allowing inter-mobility between EU agencies.  On the duration of employment, temporary agents (TAs) and contract agents (CAs) are offered typically long- term contract of three years, renewable for another limited period of five years. These contracts are  converted into contracts of indefinite period if a second renewal is offered and accepted. All contracts  renewals are subject to an assessment of the performance of the staff member and depend on budget  availability and the business needs for the function occupied as stipulated in the ED Decision 38/2017 of  6 June 2017 on employment contract renewal. In addition, ENISA is activating short-term contract agents  (2 years, renewable once for a maximum one year) to be allocated depending on business needs or any  other human resources constraints (i.e. long-term sick leave or part-time, etc.) This engagement of staff  allows ENISA to keep an adequate degree of flexibility and adapt the workforce based in the business needs.  Non-statutory staff  ENISA welcomes SNEs as an opportunity to foster the exchange of experience and knowledge of ENISA  working methods and to widen the expertise network. Experts can be seconded to ENISA for the duration of  a minimum six months to a maximum of four years. ENISA offers paid traineeship opportunities to talented,  highly qualified young professionals at the start of their careers, in a field of their choice. Trainees have the  opportunity to immerse themselves in ENISA’s work and in the European system in general. The traineeship  may last from a minimum of six months to a maximum of 12 months.  Finally, in compliance with both the EU legal framework and the Greek labour legislation, ENISA’s policy is  intended to rely on interim services under specific circumstances and for limited period. ENISA holds a  framework contract that has been awarded to a temping agency.  B. Appraisal of performance and reclassification/promotions  ENISA has adopted the implementing rules: MB 2016/10 on Reclassification of CAs, MB 2016/11 on  Reclassification of TA’s.  For the forthcoming years, the organisation will strive to see performance management as a business  process that improves employee engagement and drive business results. It will enable staff to focus on  having a constructive dialogue with the manager and to consider the exercise as a valuable developmental  tool, while clarifying that the appraisal and the promotion are two different exercises.

Mobility policy  All internal moves are processed via Article 7 of the Staff Regulations and for transparency purposes are  published internally on INTRAENISA. In order to create a motivated and versatile workforce, ENISA has  adopted an ED policy 01/2017 of 22 February 2017 on internal mobility policy. ENISA also joined the inter- agency job market (IAJM) with the view, as for all other agencies, to offer possibilities of mobility to staff in  agencies by assuring a continuation of careers and grades. In 2016, 1 staff member moved via the IAJM.  Additionally, ENISA is also opened to mobility between the agencies and the EU institutions. In 2016, no  mobility was organised while in 2017, one mobility was organised.  D. Learning and development  ENISA is striving for excellence in the approach to developing staff. In order to make the most out of its  internal expertise and to develop mechanisms to retain staff, the organisation is focusing on offering a wide  range of Learning and Development Opportunities including mandatory training (e.g. Ethics and Integrity,  harassment prevention, etc.), various workshops and team building events, online courses, access to EU- Learn, etc.  E. Gender and geographical balance  As of 31/12/2017 ENISA counts with 74 staff members (42 TAs from which 29 ADs and 13 ASTs), 29 CAs and  3 SNEs.  The overall gender balance among ENISA staff shows a male prevalence that is understandable given the  scope of ENISA’s work. As a measure to promote equal opportunities, the terms of published vacancy notices  prevent any kind of discrimination and the selection board composition is balanced in term of gender and  nationality as far as possible. In line with the European Commission’s objective to achieve 40 % female  representation in managerial positions, ENISA nominated in 2016 and 2017 a French woman as head of HR  and a Swedish woman as head of finances and procurement.  For geographical balance, while there is no quota system in operation, the staff regulations require when  recruiting to strive for a broad balance among nationalities and to adopt measures if there is imbalance  between nationalities among staff. ENISA is paying great attention to this requirement as reflected by the  latest recruitments. The overall gender balance per grade and per operational unit can be find below:  64,29%  41,67%  48,15%  60,38%  44%  42,86%  100%  50%  78%  54,12%  35,71%  58,33%  51,85%  39,62%  56%  57,14%  50%  22%  45,88%  A D  A S T  C A  C O D  R D  E D  C O D  M A N A G E M E N T  R D  M A N A G E M E N T  M A N A G E M E N T  ( T O T A L )  E N I S A  ( T O T A L )  GENDER BALANCE Male Female  ENISA programming document 2019-2021  final | December 2018  83  F. Schooling  A European School is located in Heraklion and is used by staff members of ENISA. For school year 2017-2018  2 pupils attended primary and three pupils attended secondary school.  The rest of ENISA pupils attend various schools in Athens based on service level agreement concluded with  a number of international schools. For the school year 2017-2018, 20 pupils attended nursery and  kindergarten and 19 pupils attended primary and secondary school. ENISA considers schooling as an  essential part of its staff policy and thus, contribute to the expenses of school care for the children.  Annex V: Buildings  ENISA is currently negotiating a reduction in space rented in Heraklion and an increase in the space rented  in Athens. It is expected that the relevant contracts will be negotiated and concluded in order to  accommodate all ENISA staff in a suitable work environment.  ENISA programming document 2019-2021  final | December 2018  84  Annex VI: Privileges and immunities  Agency privileges  Privileges granted to staff  Protocol of privileges and immunities/diplomatic status Education/day care  Under Article 23 of Regulation (EU)  No 526/2013 of the European Parliament  and of the Council of 21 May 2013, the  protocol No 7 on the privileges and  immunities of the European Union  annexed to the Treaty on European  Union (TEU) and the Treaty on the  Functioning of the European  Union  (TFEU) applies to ENISA and its  staff.  Under Article 23 of Regulation (EU) No 526/2013 of the  European Parliament and of the Council of 21 May 2013,  the protocol No 7 on the privileges and immunities of  the European Union annexed to the TEU and the TFEU  applies to ENISA and its staff.  The Greek Government and ENISA signed a Seat  Agreement in April 2005, which was ratified by Greek  Law 3572/2007 and is applicable to ENISA and its staff.  A public School of European Education,  Type 2, was founded in 2005 by the  Greek government in Heraklion —  Crete for the children of the staff of  ENISA.  There is no European School operating  in Athens.  Annex VII: Evaluations  Internal monitoring system Matrix has been put in place at ENISA and is used for project management by  ENISA staff. Regular progress reports are presented at the meetings of the ENISA management team and  reviewed at the midterm review meetings.  Also, external consultant has been contracted to carry annual ex post evaluation of core operational  activities. The scope of the evaluation focuses on ENISA’s core operational activities, with an estimated  expenditure above EUR 30 000. The overall objective of the annual evaluations is to evaluate the  effectiveness, efficiency, added value, utility, coordination and consistency.  Annex VIII: Risks 2019  The risk assessment was performed by the IAS in 2016. Three areas were proposed for the next 3 years:  Stakeholders’ Involvement in the Production of Deliverables in ENISA (done in 2017), Human Resources  (2018), Information and Communication Technology (2019).

ENISA’s organisation for Scenario 1 is presented below in detail, while for Scenario 2 the structure of the  departments is still to be detailed on the final outcome of the proposed ENISA regulation.  Scenario 1.  http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32013R0526 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/about-enisa/structure-organization/executive-board/enisa-executive-board-members https://www.enisa.europa.eu/about-enisa/structure-organization/executive-director  ENISA programming document 2019-2021  final | December 2018  86  Scenario 2.  ENISA programming document 2019-2021  final | December 2018  87  Annex B: Summarising the Key Indicators for the multiannual activities  ENISA is in a continuous process for improving the standing of its key indicators for of measuring and  reporting better and more accurately against its annual work programme, in line with the prescribed  Commission approach.  The purpose of key indicators for ENISA is to provide the metrics to measure against performance, results  and impact of ENISA’s outcome, output and impact. Key indicators seek to better support policy dynamics  on NIS, an area of policy that largely still remains under development at the EU level, as technology and  business models evolve.  The chosen approach initially sets the designated levels of key indicators; each type of indicator is grouped  alongside other similar ones at the appropriate level. This approach has been developed taking into  account the capability of ENISA to report, and the need to avoid any unnecessary burden on ENISA. ENISA  capability to report reflects, effort, organisational measures as well as tools available or that can be  obtained relatively easily. Measuring operational performance that concerns the policy raison d’être of  ENISA remains the focal point for the key indicators introduced. The key notions and main vectors of  annual and multiannual measurements are presented below.  Key indicators at ENISA seek to measure:   Performance that is a concern at the output level when deliverables are produced. Metrics used,  are project management-based and they include the following.  a. Adherence to the scope of the deliverable or project.  b. Budget (or financial resources) available to the output or project, remaining within prescribed  levels with a ± 5 % margin.  c. People (or human resources) available to the output or project, remaining within prescribed levels  with a ± 5 % margin.  d. Time available to carry out the output or project remaining within prescribed levels with a ± 5 %  margin.  e. Quality of performance depending on the type of output, according to the classification of output  in the work programme (being, publication, event, support).  ENISA programming document 2019-2021  final | December 2018  88   Results that are a concern at the annual and at multiannual activities’ level. The indicators used are  as follows.  a. Delivery indicator aiming at delivery of at least 95 % against work programme planning. This is  equivalent to a 3σ (3 Sigma) organisation (reaching between 93.3 % and 99.3 %); clearly ENISA has  historically proven its operational ability to deliver at much higher level, meeting 6σ (6 Sigma)  specification requirements (at 99.99 %). However allowing for a 3 Sigma level meets the  abovementioned deviation rate of ±5 % (51). The criteria used, being scope, budget, people, time  and quality, they all refer to the proper execution of the project leading up to the production of  output. This evaluation is done at the end of the project within ENISA.  b. Following the production process that leads up to an output, feedback from stakeholders is  collected on each output. Results are further aggregated on a multiannual basis by ENISA.   Impact is measured at ENISA level only; it is based on feedback received from the evaluation of  ENISA’s performance (own initiatives and commissioned consulting at ENISA’s initiative) and/or  institutional third party evaluations such as those commissioned by the European Commission, the  European Court of Auditors etc.  The key indicators broken down at the output level, the activities level and ENISA level, are presented  below.  Key indicators in ENISA  Output level Activities level Agency level  Scope (e.g. Scope drift as  compared to approved WP  plan)  S Variable:  TLR  Deliverables (number of  deliverables completed against  the WP plan)  D Numerical:  quantitative  target  Evaluation (results’  aggregates) Periodic agency  evaluation e.g. COM(2018),  Ramboll etc.)  E Variable:  TLR  Budget (e.g. appropriations  utilised and staff engaged  in a project plus or minus  5 %)  B Variable:  TLR  Feedback (number of positive  and not so positive feedback)  (*)  F Numerical:  quantitative  target  People (e.g. staff engaged  in a project plus or minus  5 %)  P Variable:  TLR  Feedback aggregates for  multiannual performance (**)  Fa Numerical:  quantitative  target  Time (e.g. duration of  project plus or minus 5 %)  T Variable:  TLR  (*) Feedback via e.g. survey  associated with deliverables on  website  Quality (e.g. citations,  downloads, MS  participation etc.)  Q Integer:  quantitative  target  (**) Aggregations of  deliverables or categories  thereof  All rating indicators follow a variable traffic-light rating (TLR) system that is laid out as follows:   Green, that reflects 5 % deviation meaning that the planning/performance are appropriate and  within prescribed levels.   Yellow, that reflects 20 % deviation meaning that the planning/performance need to be revisited.   Red, which reflects deviation above 20 % meaning that the planning/performance need thorough  review.  (51) In a normal distribution σ (or sigma) denotes the distance between the mean value and the inflection point. Shortening this distance is an indicator of  enhanced quality of performance. While a Six Sigma (or, 6σ) methodology is beyond the scope of the current version of the ENISA QMS,  portions of it  are used in select areas, such as key indicators. In ENISA, the reference standard operating procedure (SOP) here is the SOP PDCA that is a simplified  version of the define-measure-analyse-improve-control (DMAIC) approach typically associated with Six Sigma. The choice for simplicity is obviously  desirable while the implementation of a quality system is an ongoing concern. Six Sigma focuses on process control for reducing or eliminating waste. Six  Sigma utilises historical data along with statistical analysis to measure and improve a company’s operational performance e.g. processes, practices and  support systems. Six Sigma is a measure of process quality the variation of which is measured in six standard deviations from the mean.  ENISA programming document 2019-2021  final | December 2018  89  Feedback is collected by means of surveys. It is envisaged that the deliverables part of the website will be  leveraged to channel targeted feedback against each deliverable downloaded. This is a task however that  will be made available as from 2018, at the earliest.  Below follows an example of output related indicators to be collected on the key types of agency output,  being publication, Event, Support types of output.  #  KPI Description Output type (P) (*) Output type (E) (**) Output type (S) (***)  1 S Defined in the planning phase and  confirmed throughout delivery  Scope in start remains identical to scope in the end  2 B Budget remains within ± 5 % of  designated budget level to cover the  established requirements  Working group, external  supplier, experts etc.  Logistics, reimbursements for  speakers, catering,  communication etc.  Technical equipment, services,  communication, market research  etc.  3 P Staff allocated to remain within ±5 %  of designated FTEs  REF: Matrix data  4 T Project duration to remain within  ±5 % of planned time  REF: Matrix data  5 Q Any of the following quality indicators  as appropriate  Number of MS involved,  experts from MS authorities,  Industry representatives,  R & D etc., % population  (survey) etc.  Number of participants,  aggregation of feedback in  event survey etc.  Number of subscribers,  aggregation of feedback of  participants; feedback of the  policy principal (e.g. COM /MS  etc.)  (*) Publication e.g. methods for security and privacy cost analysis  (**) Event e.g. workshop on privacy and security  (***) Support e.g. NIS portal  Below follows an example of outcome related indicators to be collected on the key types of agency  activities, at the annual and at the multiannual level.

ENISA welcomes the new proposed cybersecurity act which provides for a strengthened ENISA  with additional resources and staff. In addition to this, ENISA welcomes the 2017 cybersecurity package of  legislative and non-legislative cybersecurity measures. ENISA also looks forward to the new permanent  mandate, for the additional resources and additional budget to contribute to the new tasks provided for in  the current version of the cybersecurity act.  ENISA welcomes cooperation in the area of cybersecurity. Current challenges are common worldwide; a  lot of effort is needed to mitigate the risks and to address the global challenges. Many EU MSs will benefit  from a joint approach and EU institutions and EU bodies such as ENISA can help to foster effective EU  cooperation, maximising the outcome and impact of developed solutions, best practices, methodologies  and mechanisms supporting cybersecurity.  ENISA welcomes the proposed tasks related to the education and improvement of skills to address the  lack of digital and cybersecurity skills in the EU. At EU level, there is an increased need for digital skills and  cybersecurity skills in particular. It is acknowledged currently that 44 % of European citizens do not have  basic digital skills (1); Europe also lacks skilled ICT specialists to fill the growing number of job vacancies in  all sectors of the economy.  The cybersecurity talent shortage (2) is estimated at more than a million openings worldwide with many  thousands of companies having difficulties in filling posts. The problem is here and is likely to stay. The  global shortage of cybersecurity professionals is estimated to rise to two million by 2019 (3). The ENISA  Threat landscape report 2016 acknowledges the skills shortage (4) and recommends engagements in the  areas of cybersecurity education, training and awareness.  ENISA is ready to work closely with all relevant stakeholders to make the certification proposal a reality.  ENISA welcomes the proposal for an EU-wide cybersecurity-certification framework presented in the draft  cybersecurity act. It provides for several assurance levels and specific evaluation criteria. In addition, the  cybersecurity act draft proposes conditions for marking and labelling; it sets out the mechanisms to  demonstrate continual compliance as appropriate; it provides for the conditions to grant maintenance and  extension of a certificate etc.  The proposal is an EU initiative for an EU-based framework that meets the demands of private  stakeholders as well as those of the MSs. The prospect for the market can be significant as the EU can  improve its position in internal market purchasing (private as well as through public procurement) and  become a reference point to meet the challenge posed by global competition.  ENISA is looking forward to assuming the new roles seeking to support the Commission in its duties and  the MSs in transitioning to an EU framework.

For several years ENISA has been improving its planning and in consultation with its management  board (MB) set out priorities for its activities in order to be able to deliver the most urgent, important and  sensitive results for the protection our EU cyberspace. In the preparation of the 2019 work programme  ENISA, together with its MB, decided to prepare the planning by considering two scenarios. These are (a)  Scenario 1, which assumes no change to the current mandate and (b) Scenario 2 where it is assumed that  the cybersecurity act is adopted.  In detail, Scenario 1 (assuming that the new regulation is not in place) uses the resources available in the  multiannual financial framework (MFF) 2014-2020 (COM(2013)519) while Scenario 2, (new regulation in  place by latest mid-2019) adds new tasks and activities as proposed in the Cybersecurity Act  COM(2017)477 using resources as proposed in the draft general budget of the European Union for the  financial year 2019 (5).  In this programming document, the planned activities for 2019 in both scenarios are presented. The  document follows the structure laid down by the new Commission guidelines for programming documents  provided in the context of the framework financial regulation and the five pillars of the ENISA strategy.  Activities are labelled indicating to which scenario these activities belong. Activities labelled as Scenario 2  are only proposed to be delivered if the draft Cybersecurity Act is adopted. Section ‘List of outputs in 2019  work programme’, just before the annexes, summarises the outputs for the two scenarios: the first list  covers the Scenario 1 outputs, to be delivered independent of the adoption of the cybersecurity act, while  the second list includes the new outputs to be delivered as soon as the cybersecurity act is published in the  Official Journal.  I look forward to the next phase in ENISA’s development.

The mission of ENISA has been to contribute to securing Europe’s information society by raising  ‘awareness of network and information security [(NIS)] and to develop and promote a culture, of network  and information security in society for the benefit of citizens, consumers, enterprises and public sector  organisations in the Union’ (6).  ENISA supports the European institutions, the Member States and the business community in addressing,  responding to and especially in preventing NIS problems. It does so through a series of activities across five  areas identified in its strategy.   Expertise: information, knowledge and skill on key NIS issues.   Policy: support policymaking and implementation in the EU.   Capacity: support capacity building across the EU (e.g. through training, recommendations and  awareness-raising activities).   Community: promote the NIS community (e.g. support computer emergency response teams  (CERTs), coordination of pan-European cyber exercises).   Enabling (e.g. engagement with stakeholders and furthering of international relations).  In doing so, ENISA will act ‘without prejudice to the competence of the Member States regarding network  and information security and ... to activities concerning public security, defence, national security’ (7) and in  compliance with the right of initiative of the European Commission. In order to achieve its mission, several  objectives and tasks (8) have been assigned to ENISA.  In line with these objectives and tasks, ENISA carries out its operations under an annual and multiannual  work programme containing all of its planned activities drawn up by the executive director and adopted by  the MB.  ENISA’s approach is strongly impact driven, based on the involvement of all relevant stakeholder  communities, with a strong emphasis on pragmatic solutions that offer a sensible mix of short-term and  long-term improvements. ENISA also provides the EU institutions, bodies and agencies (hereinafter:  ‘European Union institutions’) and the Member States with a mechanism allowing them to call upon its  services to support their NIS capability development (9), resulting in a more agile and flexible approach to  achieving its mission.

ENISA will reinforce these communication channels via the  development of sustainable cooperation in its various domains of competence.   Working closely with competent EU institutions dealing with other aspects of NIS (the European Union  Agency for Law-Enforcement Cooperation (Europol), the European Defence Agency (EDA), the  European External Action Service (EEAS), sectorial agencies, etc.).   Achieving results by leveraging relevant stakeholder communities, allowing ENISA to strengthen its  knowledge of national NIS developments and facilitate the involvement of NIS experts in its activities,  from NIS national competent authorities, the private sector and academia.   Supporting public-private cooperation, with a view to reducing the fragmentation of the digital single  market and support the development of the digital security industry in Europe.  A stronger ENISA as of 2020  • EU policy development and implementation   Proactively contributing to the development of policy in the area of NIS, as well as to other policy  initiatives with cybersecurity elements in different sectors (e.g. energy, transport and finance).   Providing independent opinions and preparatory work for the development and the update of  policy and law.   Supporting EU policy and law in the areas of electronic communications, electronic identity and  trust services, with a view to promoting an enhanced level of cybersecurity.   Assisting Member States in achieving a consistent approach on the implementation of the NISD  across borders and sectors, as well as in other relevant policies and laws.   Providing regular reporting on the state of implementation of the EU legal framework.  • Capacity building   Contributing to the improvement of EU and national public authority capabilities and expertise,  including on incident response and on the supervision of cybersecurity-related regulatory  measures.   Contributing to the establishment of information-sharing and analysis centres (ISACs) in various  sectors by providing information on best practice and guidance on available tools and procedures,  as well as by appropriately addressing regulatory issues related to information sharing.  • Knowledge and information, awareness raising   Becoming a key information hub of the EU for cybersecurity.   Promoting and sharing best practice and initiatives across the EU by pooling information on  cybersecurity deriving from the EU and national institutions, agencies and bodies.   Making advice, guidance and information on critical-infrastructure security best practice available.   In the aftermath of significant cross-border cybersecurity incidents, compiling reports with a view  to providing guidance to businesses and people across the EU.   Regularly organising awareness-raising activities in coordination with MS authorities.  ENISA programming document 2019-2021  final | December 2018  11  • Market-related tasks (standardisation, cybersecurity certification)   Performing a number of functions specifically supporting the internal market and e.g. to provide a  cybersecurity ‘market observatory’ by analysing relevant trends in the cybersecurity market to  better match demand and supply and by supporting EU policy development in ICT standardisation  and ICT cybersecurity certification areas.   With regard to standardisation in particular, facilitating the establishment and uptake of  cybersecurity standards.   Executing the tasks provided for in the context of the future framework for certification.  • Research and innovation (R & I)   Contributing its expertise by advising EU and national authorities on priority setting in research  and development (R & D), including in the context of the contractual public-private partnership on  cybersecurity (cPPP).   Advising the new European cybersecurity research and competence centre on research under the  next multi-annual financial framework   Being involved (when asked to do so by the Commission) in the implementation of research and  innovation (R & I) EU funding programmes.  • Operational cooperation and crisis management   Strengthening the existing preventive operational capabilities, in particular upgrading the pan- European cybersecurity exercises (Cyber Europe).   Supporting operational cooperation as secretariat of the computer-security and incident-response  team (CSIRTs Network) (as per NISD provisions) by ensuring, among other things, the good  functioning of the CSIRTs Network IT infrastructure and communication channels and by ensuring  structured cooperation with CERT-EU, the European Cybercrime Centre (EC3), EDA and other  relevant EU institutions in line with the Commission proposal for the cybersecurity act (10).  • Play a role in the EU cybersecurity blueprint   Presented as part of this package and setting the Commission’s recommendation to Member  States for a coordinated response to large-scale cross-border cybersecurity incidents and crises at  EU level in line with the Commission proposal for the cybersecurity act.   Facilitating cooperation e.g. at blueprint technical (CSIRT) and operational level (single point of  contact), between individual Member States in dealing with emergency response by analysing and  aggregating national situational reports based on information made available to ENISA on a  voluntary basis by Member States and other entities.  • Cybersecurity certification of ICT products and services   European cybersecurity-certification framework for ICT products and services specifies the  essential functions and tasks of ENISA in cybersecurity certification. The draft sets out that ENISA  prepares the European cybersecurity-certification schemes, with the assistance, expert advice and  close cooperation of the European cybersecurity-certification group. Upon the EU Commission’s  request to prepare a scheme for specific ICT products and services, ENISA will work on the scheme  in close cooperation with national certification supervisory authorities represented in the group.  The same may apply upon the request of the Member States or the group.  (10) COM(2017)477  ENISA programming document 2019-2021  final | December 2018  12  Section I. General context  Threat landscape  2017 was the year in which incidents in the cyber-threat landscape have led to the definitive recognition of  some omnipresent facts. We have gained unwavering evidence on monetisation methods, attacks to  democracies, cyber-war, transformation of malicious infrastructures and the dynamics within threat-agent  groups.  But 2017 has also brought successful operations against cybercriminals. Law enforcement, governments  and vendors have managed to shut down illegal dark markets, de-anonymise the darknet and arrest  cybercriminals. Moreover, state-sponsored campaigns have been revealed and details of technologies  deployed by nation states have been leaked. Most remarkable though is the manifestation of the cyber- threat landscape within framework programmes that are about to be established in the area of critical- infrastructure protection: cyber threats make up the basis for the development and implementation of red  and blue teaming activities in financial sector across Europe.  The cybersecurity community is still far from striking the balance between defenders and attackers.  Although 2017 has reached records in security investment, it has also brought new records in cyberattacks  of all kinds, data breaches and information loss. From this perspective, one may argue that there is a  market failure in cybersecurity; that is, the increased defence levels and expenses cannot successfully  reduce levels of cyber-threat exposure.  Whether this is due to a segmented cybersecurity market, lack of awareness or capabilities and skills, are  topics of vivid discussions in the corresponding communities. The fact is however, that in 2017 we have  seen extremely increased amounts of information on cybersecurity incidents, cyber threats and related  matters deluge all kinds of media. This trend is indicative for the high level of interest assigned by the  media to cybersecurity issues.  In summary, the main trends in the 2017 cyber-threat landscape were as follows.   Complexity of attacks and sophistication of malicious actions in cyberspace continued increasing.   Threat agent of all types have advanced in obfuscation (that is, hiding their trails).   Malicious infrastructures continue their transformation towards multipurpose configurable  functions including anonymisation, encryption, detection and evasion.   Monetisation of cybercrime is becoming the main motive of threat agents, in particular cyber- criminals. They take advantage of the anonymity offered by digital currencies.   State-sponsored people or organisations are one of the most omnipresent malicious agents in  cyberspace. They are top concern of commercial and governmental defenders.   Cyber-war is entering dynamically into cyberspace creating increased concerns to critical- infrastructure operators, especially in areas that experience some sort of crisis.   Skills and capabilities are the main concerns for organisations. The extensive need for related  training programmes and educational curricula remains almost unsatisfied.  All these trends are assessed and analysed by means of the content of the ENISA Threat landscape report  2017. Identified open issues leveraged on these trends and proposed policy, business and  research/educational action. They serve as recommendations and are taken into account in the future  activities of ENISA and its stakeholders.  ENISA programming document 2019-2021  final | December 2018  13  In 2017 the frequency and impact of serious incidents grew. The proliferation of ransomware, for example,  reached an approximate 2 000 % increase in 2017 and drew everyone’s attention to the reality of cyber  threats and their possible critical impacts and costs.  The cooperation between law-enforcement agencies and private-sector organisations was an important  factor in identifying malicious activities and infrastructure takedowns and it is likely that such cooperation  activities between communities as well as between Member States, will play an increasingly important role  both in the fight against cybercrime and in the attempt to reinforce EU systems against potential attacks.  Concluding, on top of a quite active cybercrime scene, the ETL has indicated that high profile (state- sponsored) attackers have advanced in line with the developments of the entire threat landscape:  complexity, sophistication and advancements in capabilities have been observed for most of the threat- agent groups. While the race between the ‘good’ and the ‘bad’ guys continues, advancements in  obfuscation and masquerading of threat agents make it more difficult to understand who is who. This  difficulty has led to an alerting phenomenon: the user community cannot differentiate between the bad  and the good and thus lose trust in commercial and even institutional players in cyberspace.  In the context of all these developments, ENISA has identified numerous activities to cope with the trends  of the cyber-threat landscape and increase knowledge and capability levels for various stakeholder groups.  Policy initiatives  Since its set up in 2004 the EU NIS agency, ENISA, has actively contributed to: raising awareness of NIS  challenges in Europe, the development of Member State NIS capacities and the reinforcement of the  cooperation of Member States and other NIS stakeholders.  NIS has been set high in the EU political agenda (notably in the European cybersecurity strategy (2013), the  European cyber defence policy framework (2014) and in the European digital single market (2015)). ENISA  will need to accompany the efforts of Member States and EU institutions in reinforcing NIS across Europe.  Above all, the recent adoption of the European directive on measures to ensure a high common level of NIS  further calls for ENISA to enhance its commitment to supporting a consistent approach towards NIS across  Europe.  While ENISA should continue its well-established activities (from the support to the reinforcement of MS  national capacities to the organisation of cyber-crisis exercises) the adoption of the NISD will require ENISA  to develop further areas of action to accompany the evolution of NIS in Europe. ENISA will play a key role in:  contributing to the NIS technical and operational cooperation by actively supporting MS CSIRT cooperation  within the European CSIRTs Network and the NIS Cooperation Group; providing input and expertise for  policy-level collaboration between national competent authorities as part of the cooperation group;  supporting the reinforcement EU institution NIS in strong cooperation with CERT-EU and with the institutions  themselves. In parallel, ENISA will continue to contribute to the reinforcement of NIS as a driver of the digital  single market (DSM) and more generally of economic growth in Europe, including the development of NIS  and related ICT industries in Europe.  While several EU institutions are mandated to act in the area of cybersecurity (CERT-EU, Europol, the EDA,  the EEAS, etc.) ENISA aims to be the key point of reference for strategic analysis and advice on NIS issues.  ENISA seeks to engage with other stakeholders (in particular the private sector) to use its experience and  expertise to support them in their activities and to engage them in the EU effort to ensure a significant  improvement of the state of cybersecurity in Europe.  The publication of the new EU cybersecurity package with its set of legislative and non-legislative measures  (13 September 2017) has identified ENISA as a key pillar of the EU’s ambition towards the reinforcement of  cybersecurity across Europe. The strategy provides for the strengthening and reinforcing ENISA.  ENISA programming document 2019-2021  final | December 2018  14   Section 2.1 addresses ENISA and its strengthening: it proposes a permanent mandate.   It acknowledges ENISA’s role in the NISD.   It proposes an EU cybersecurity-certification framework: ENISA is to develop certification schemes  and provide secretariat assistance to the EU cybersecurity-certification group. It envisages  frameworks for:  o critical high-risk applications,  o widely deployed digital products and services,  o low-cost digital devices.  ENISA welcomes the renewed cybersecurity strategy (11) and the proposed new cybersecurity act (12).

Multiannual programming 2019-2021  Multiannual programme  This section reflects midterm priorities to guide the activities of ENISA for the next 3 years.  Priorities are supplemented with indications on the following.    Guidelines to underpin ENISA’s implementation of the multiannual and annual programming  document.    The expected added value of ENISA’s work in achieving these priorities.  Annual outputs will derive from these priorities.  Activity 1 — Expertise. Anticipate and support Europe in facing emerging network and information- security (NIS) challenges  Multiannual priorities (2019-2021) for Objective 1.1. Improving the expertise related to NIS  Priorities   Undertake regular stocktaking of existing expertise within the EU on NIS challenges related to  existing or future services and technologies, and make that information available to the EU NIS  community.   Among these challenges, focus on key issues to offer analyses and general recommendations.   Seek to explore in particular software-related issues (e.g. mobile), interpersonal-communications  services (ICS)/ supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA), smart infrastructures and the  internet of things (IoT).  Guidelines   Collate and analyse in priority available expertise provided by national NIS competent authorities,  closely liaise with them to support stocktaking activity and, when undertaking analyses and making  recommendations, offer the opportunity to voluntary experts (from these authorities as well as  from other relevant stakeholders) to take part in its work.   Focus on challenges of significant added value for the EU NIS community and on the impact that  aspects of those challenges may have on the functioning of critical economic and societal functions  with the EU, as provided for in the NISD (e.g. expertise relevant to operators of essential  services (OES)).   Take a holistic approach encompassing the technical, organisational, regulatory and policy  dimensions of NIS as well as different relevant approaches, including the user perspective and  work whenever possible on a multiannual basis to deepen the understanding of identified issues.  Added value   Provide European-wide visibility to existing NIS expertise, in particular that developed at national  level.   Foster convergent understanding of NIS challenges across the EU NIS community as well as of best  practices to address them, by offering tailored, high-quality and up-to-date analyses and  recommendations.   Raise awareness of OES, European institutions and national public authorities of emerging security  challenges that should be taken into account at technical and policy levels.  ENISA programming document 2019-2021  final | December 2018  16   Support its work under Activity 2 (policy), 3 (capacity) and 4 (community) by advising on challenges  that may influence EU NIS policy developments and implementation, national and European  capacity building as well as crisis and CSIRT cooperation.  Multiannual priorities (2019-2021) for Objective 1.2. NIS threat landscape and analysis  Priorities   Carry out an annual EU threat-landscape analyses, offering a general technical assessment of  existing and anticipated threats and their root causes.   Produce annual analyses of national incident reports according to the implementation of the  telecom package, electronic identification and trust services for electronic transactions in the  internal market (eIDAS) regulation13 and the NISD.   In addition to the general threat assessment, focus also on a specific dimension (e.g. sector or  cross-sector threats in the context of the NISD, or threats to existing technologies whose usage is  increasing e.g. internet protocol version 6 (IPv6) and threats whose risk is today underestimated  but may increase in the future).   Establish dissemination channels for the information created (threat intelligence) and make it  available to stakeholders. The delivered threat intelligence is to consist of both main and side  products of the threat assessments (e.g. cyber threats, threat agents, assets, mitigation controls,  collected sources, other related items), put in context as appropriate.   Provide a concise cyber-threat overview on a regular basis as they materialise within incidents.  Such information should provide an overview of the findings of available open-source evidence in  a neutral manner.  Guidelines   Seek synergies among national incident reports in the ENISA analyses mentioned above.   Ensure that the EU threat-landscape analyses benefit from relevant sources of information, in  particular vendor reports, national threat assessments, research, media as well as information  stemming from the CSIRTs network.   Seek to enhance the visibility of these results to the EU NIS community by delivering generated  material for various stakeholders in a consistent manner.

A detailed presentation of key performance indicators (KPIs), key results  indicators (KRIs) and key impact indicators (KII) is provided in Annex B.  Human and financial resource outlook 2019-2021  Annex A1 provided the resource outlook and contains a brief description of new tasks and efficiency gains.  ENISA programming document 2019-2021  final | December 2018  25  Section III. Work programme 2019  The ENISA 2019 work programme follows the layout presented in multiannual programming Section II. In  this section objectives, results and indicators are identified in relation to each activity.  The activities presented in this section follow the structure of the ENISA strategy. After a short description  of the activity the objectives are presented. A short narrative is included, consisting of a description of the  activity and its anticipated added value, the main challenges for 2019 and a link to the multiannual  objectives.  The main outputs/actions in the specific year, for this case for 2019, are listed within each objective. For  each objective there are several outputs set out.  For each output, the following are included in this document.   A description of the specific actions and outcome which are expected to contribute to the  achievement of the objective.   The type of output (in summary table at the end of each activity):  o P: publication (e.g. reports, studies, papers),  o E: event (e.g. conferences, workshops or seminars),  o S: support activity, involving assistance to or close collaboration with e.g. EU institutions or  Member States (as appropriate), for a specific activity that features established and shared  objectives.   KPIs tailored to the type of output in summary table at the end of each activity.   Resources and budget, in a summary table at the end of the section in aggregated form at activity  level.  For each activity there is an objective established that covers the actions that ENISA is carrying out in order  to respond to official ‘Article 14 requests’, named after Article 14 of the ENISA regulation (14), which allows  the MS and EU institutions to make direct requests to ENISA seeking assistance or advice on specific  activities.  In the preparation of the 2019 work programme, ENISA is considering two scenarios. Scenario 1 uses the  resources available in MFF 2014-2020 (COM(2013)519). Scenario 2 (which assumes that the new  regulation will be in place by latest mid-2019), adds new tasks and activities using resources as proposed in  the draft Cybersecurity Act COM(2017)477 and in alignment with the draft 2019 EU general budget . Each  output is labelled accordingly as a Scenario 1 or Scenario 2 output. Activities labelled as Scenario 2 are only  proposed to be delivered if the draft cybersecurity act is adopted.  (14) According to Regulation (EU) No 526/2013. When the cybersecurity act is adopted (Scenario 2), these objectives will be reallocated and relabelled based  on the new legal framework and corresponding articles.  ENISA programming document 2019-2021  final | December 2018  26  Activity 1 — Expertise. Anticipate and support Europe in facing emerging network and  information-security challenges  Objective 1.1. Improving the expertise related to network and information security (NIS)  Output O.1.1.1 — Good practices for the security of the internet of things (IoT) (Scenario 1)  IoT is at the core of operations for many OES as defined in the NISD, especially considering recent  initiatives towards smart infrastructures, industry 4.0 (15), 5G (16), smart grids (17), etc. With a great impact  on the safety of the public, security and privacy, the IoT threat landscape is extremely complex. Therefore,  it is important to understand what exactly needs to be secured and to implement specific security  measures to protect the IoT from cyber threats.  Building on its previous work on IoT security, ENISA will identify and analyse existing IoT security practices  and standards (e.g. in the area of industry 4.0 and critical information infrastructures or consumer  electronics), taking into consideration existing national expertise and practices. ENISA will map the  evolving threat landscape and compare these practices and standards and develop good practices for the  security of the internet of things focusing on its impact on the overall supply chain and considering  relevant interdependencies.  To satisfy these goals, ENISA will take into account and contribute to existing EU policy and regulatory  initiatives (e.g. the NISD, the IoT action plan for Europe (18), the communication on building strong  cybersecurity for the EU (19), the PPP on cybersecurity (20) and the 5G infrastructure public-private  partnership (5G PPP) (21)).  ENISA will develop targeted IoT case studies to identify risks and vulnerabilities, by setting out appropriate  attack scenarios, and providing relevant recommendations and good practice. Moreover, it will consider  establishing e.g. IoT security requirements, maturity levels, procurement guidelines or other means to  promote awareness and to ensure security for safety. ENISA will also consider implementing online tools to  visualise IoT security measures in order to further support stakeholders.  ENISA will also validate the results of the study (e.g. via joint workshops such as the two organised with  Europol/EC3) with relevant national and EU initiatives (e.g. Alliance for the Internet of Things Innovation  (AIOTI), Industrial Internet Consortium IIC (IIC) and interact with important digitised industries in the EU  and IoT stakeholders from the public sector (e.g. DG Communications Networks, Content and Technology,  the Joint Research Centre (JRC), Europol/EC3), as well as from the private sector including operators,  integrators and manufacturers.  This work item builds on previous ENISA work in the area of IoT (WP2017-2018) and smart infrastructures  (WP2015-2017).

Smart cars already available today provide connected, added-value features in order to enhance car users’  experience or improve car safety. With this increased connectivity (which the emergence of 5G is expected  to further promote) novel cybersecurity risks and threats arise and need to be managed. In light of the  NISD, where road authorities and intelligent transport systems are among the entities identified as OES in  the road-transport subsector, there is a growing call for smart-car security to be addressed.  ENISA will build on its previous smart car work (22) and identify and analyse existing security practices and  standards in this area (e.g. UN-ECE dedicated task force (TF) on CYBER, International Organisation for  Standardisation (ISO)/SAE standardisation work) analysing the emerging notions of connectivity and  autonomy. ENISA will review these practices and standards and highlight or suggest good practices and  potential legislative action required for smart car security, safety, connectivity and autonomy, while  mapping the emerging threat landscape.  Building on the previous initiative ‘Europe on the Move’ of May 2017, the European Commission put  forward a strategy to make the EU a world leader for automated and connected mobility (17 May 2018).  To assist the Commission and the Member States in achieving these objectives ENISA will consider and  contribute to existing EU policy and regulatory initiatives (the NISD, the European strategy on cooperative  intelligent transport systems (23), the DG Mobility and Transport C-ITS platform (24), the high-level group  GEAR 2030 (25)), as well as the 3rd mobility package (26) and the communication on connected and  automated mobility (CAM). This agenda provides a common vision for developing and deploying key  technologies, services and infrastructure. Among these actions, it is envisaged that the Commission will  work towards the adoption of a recommendation by the end of 2018 to be addressed to the Member  States and industry. The recommendation would pertain to the use of pioneer spectrum for 5G large-scale  testing, cybersecurity issues and a data-governance framework that enables data sharing, in line with the  initiatives of the 2018 data package. ENISA will take into account industry initiatives such as the European  Automotive Telecom Alliance (EATA) and the 5G automotive alliance.  ENISA will develop targeted smart cars case studies to identify risks and vulnerabilities, by setting out  appropriate attack scenarios, and providing relevant recommendations and good practices to ensure  ‘security for safety’ in regard to connected and autonomous vehicles. This work should support the  Commission in the recommendation deliverable listed in the communication on CAM.  ENISA will examine the concept of information-sharing initiatives among relevant stakeholders in the  automotive sector. This stems from the relevant recommendations of the WP2016 ENISA study, as well as  related industry guidelines, e.g. Association des Constructeurs Européens d'Automobiles (ACEA).  ENISA will also validate the results of the study (e.g. via joint workshops) with relevant national and EU  initiatives (such as EATA and European Road Transport Telematics Implementation Co-ordination  Organisation (ERTICO) and interact with all important smart-car stakeholders from the public sector (such  as the relevant European Commission service, JRC, national road authorities and from the private sector  including automotive manufacturers, Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEMs)).

Output O.1.1.3 — Awareness raising on existing technical specifications for cryptographic algorithms  (Scenario 1)  In the revised cybersecurity strategy of the EU published in September (27), the European Commission  highlights ‘[…] the lack of European capacity on assessing the encryption of products and services used by  the public, businesses and governments within the digital single market. Strong encryption is the basis for  secure digital identification systems that play a key role in effective cybersecurity […]’. Furthermore, in  Article 10 of its proposal for a regulation on ENISA, the ‘EU cybersecurity agency’, repealing Regulation  (EU) 526/2013, of 13 Sept 2017, the European Commission is calling ENISA to ‘…advise the Union and the  Member States on research needs and priorities in the area of cybersecurity, with a view to enabling  effective responses to current and emerging risks and threats, including with respect to new and emerging  information and communications technologies, and to using risk-prevention technologies effective’. One of  the most important technologies satisfying the criteria of security-enhancing as well as privacy-enhancing  technology is encryption.  While acknowledging the importance of crypto-technologies in cybersecurity, encryption is still a key area  of national security, especially for the protection of sensitive governmental systems as well as critical  information infrastructures. To harmonise both market needs and MS responsibilities it is essential to work  together on sharing existing approaches, best practice and knowledge. In international standardisation,  technical specifications for cryptographic algorithms already exist which should be considered at European  level, too. Moreover, at European level the so-called SOGIS-MRA crypto catalogue (28) is already a major  achievement as the first comprehensive collection of cryptographic means agreed on by participating MS  competent authorities.  Working closely with the Member States, ENISA will act as a catalyst to raise awareness of already existing  cryptographic means based on a wider promotion of the SOGIS catalogue. Especially in light of the new EU  certification framework where ENISA plays a significant role, ENISA will start in 2019 to discuss with the  existing SOGIS crypto working group the possibilities of a long-term relationship and exchange. As a  starting point, ENISA will participate in respective meetings of the group.  For standardisation ENISA should facilitate the establishment and take-up of European and international  standards for risk management and for the security of ICT processes, products and services — and this  includes cryptography.  ENISA could engage with ETSI groups concerned with cryptography — primarily TC cyber and its Quantum- Safe Cryptography (QSC) subgroup as well as TC Electronic Signatures and Infrastructures (ESI). ENISA could  also promulgate the outputs of these groups by linking to them from its website. A similar arrangement  could be in place for relevant European Committee for Standardisation (CEN)/European Committee for  Electrotechnical Standardisation (Cenelec) groups (primarily JTC-13 as it begins its work).

Based  on ENISA studies, the current healthcare-sector cybersecurity situation has shown that the level of  cybersecurity is low. For example, most hospitals do not have a chief information-security officer, there is a  lack of security policies, of access control mechanisms; hospitals are easy targets due to their interoperable  systems and due to the high vulnerability of legacy medical devices.  Newly adopted EU legislation has indicated a shift in priorities: the NISD lists healthcare organisations as  OES, the medical devices regulation (29) (MDR) includes obligatory safety and security provisions for  medical devices and there is a Commission communication on enabling digital transformation of health  and care in the digital single market (30).  ENISA, based on previous experience, will support healthcare organisations in enhancing their  cybersecurity level by helping them to make the right decisions when procuring equipment and services  supporting their internal systems. ENISA will identify existing vulnerabilities and risks in healthcare- organisation systems (also those deriving from medical devices). ENISA will map the evolving threat  landscape and collect common practices for ensuring cybersecurity in these interoperable systems. The  ultimate goal is to provide healthcare organisations with a list of security requirements and measures in  order for them to make informed decisions when procuring equipment and services. This is not linked to  the certification topic.  To achieve these goals, ENISA will take into account existing national and EU policies and regulations, such  as the requirements deriving from the NISD and will not contradict and interfere with those provisions and  international standards (such as Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPPA) and ISO  27799) as well as position papers from Commission working groups (MDR working group and the eHealth  network).  ENISA will also validate the results of any studies (e.g. via joint workshops) with relevant national and EU  initiatives and interact with healthcare organisations and policymakers (e.g. ASIP Sante in France, SPMS in  Portugal), NIS competent authorities, as well as with experts from the private sector including operators,  integrators and manufacturers. ENISA will offer experts the possibility to contribute to this work through  informal expert groups.  This work builds on previous work of ENISA in the areas of healthcare security (WP 2015), smart hospitals  (WP 2016) and NISD implementation (WP 2017).  Output O.1.1.5 — Good practices for maritime security (port security) (Scenario 2)  Ports serve a critical function in domestic and international supply-chain activities by connecting sea and  inland transport services. In the EU sea, ports play a significant role, facilitating 90 % of the EU’s external  trade (by weight) and an additional 43 % of internal market exchanges. In addition, ports in the EU  constitute energy hubs for conventional and renewable energies, serve 400 million passengers annually  and generate employment (31). Ports are a critical information infrastructure for water transport and  (29) https://ec.europa.eu/growth/sectors/medical-devices/regulatory-framework_en  (30) https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/communication-enabling-digital-transformation-health-and-care-digital-single-market-  empowering  (31) https://ec.europa.eu/transport/modes/maritime/ports/ports_en  https://ec.europa.eu/growth/sectors/medical-devices/regulatory-framework_en https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/communication-enabling-digital-transformation-health-and-care-digital-single-market-empowering https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/communication-enabling-digital-transformation-health-and-care-digital-single-market-empowering https://ec.europa.eu/transport/modes/maritime/ports/ports_en  ENISA programming document 2019-2021  final | December 2018  30  identified as OES in the NISD, where managing bodies of ports, including their port facilities and entities  operating works and equipment contained within ports are all eligible to be classified as OES.  ENISA will provide port authorities and service providers and developers with good security and resilience  practices when designing, developing and deploying services in order to minimise the exposure of such  networks and services to all relevant cyber-threat categories. The good practices will consider both the  current port ICT environment and the emerging trends in business models and supporting ICT systems.  ENISA will take stock of existing practices and standards and develop good practices with a focus on critical  port services resilience and user safety, while analysing specific-use cases to determine attack scenarios.  In this endeavour ENISA will take into account and contribute to existing EU policy and regulatory  initiatives, such as the NISD and will not contradict and interfere with those national provisions, and  interact with key stakeholders from the public sector, such as DG Mobility and Transport and the European  Maritime Safety agency (EMSA) and from the private sector, such as managing bodies of ports, port  facilities, water-transport companies, operators of vessel-traffic services and ICT-product and service  vendors to collect information and validate study findings.  This work builds on previous work of ENISA in the areas of maritime (2011), intelligent transportation  systems (WP 2015) and smart critical infrastructures (2016).  Objective 1.2. NIS threat landscape and analysis  Output O.1.2.1 — Annual ENISA threat landscape (Scenario 1)  This report will provide an overview of current threats and their consequences. It contains tactical and  strategic information about cyber threats. It also refers to threat agents and attack vectors used. The  ENISA threat landscape (ETL) report is hence a source of generic cyberthreat intelligence (CTI) by means of  interrelated information objects. The contents of the report are based on an intensive information  collection exercise, followed by analysis and consolidation of publicly available information on cyber  threats, including annual incident reports.  The ENISA ETL provides information on threat-exposure reduction. This information will consist of available  controls that are appropriate in order to reduce exposure and so mitigate the resulting risks. In addition to  the ETL, ENISA will make available to the public all relevant material that has been collected during the  year.  The dissemination, concise presentation and online availability of CTI will be in focus in 2019. Available CTI  will be interlinked with other related ENISA results (see also chapter Multiannual priorities (2019-2021) for  Objective 1.2. NIS threat landscape and analysis).  In this manner, ETL stakeholders will be in a position to access and interact with ENISA cyberthreat  information on a permanent basis. In 2019, ENISA will continue the cooperation with CERT-EU in the area  of threat landscaping. This effort will be carried out by means of information exchanges, use of CERT-EU  services and the organisation of common meetings/events. In carrying out this work, collaboration with  related experts (e.g. ENISA ETL stakeholder group) and vendors (through memorandums of  understanding (MoUs)) will be maintained and expanded.  In 2019, ENISA will continue supporting the relevant CTI stakeholder community by organizing a CTI EU  event for dissemination of CTI good practices and providing an interaction platform. This is the main  ENISA programming document 2019-2021  final | December 2018  31  instrument of mobilisation of CTI stakeholders; it will engage in the dissemination of ENISA CTI information  of all kinds (e.g. Info notes).  Output O.1.2.2 — Restricted and public Info notes on NIS (Scenario 1)  ENISA provides guidance on important NIS events and developments through Info Notes. From 2018 ENISA  has produced two distinct types of info note; ‘CSIRT Info Notes’ and ‘general Info Notes’. This will be  continued in 2019.  CSIRT Info Notes  CSIRT Info Notes cover incidents and/or vulnerabilities of an EU dimension that are within the scope of  activities of the CSIRTs network. Such notes will only be published following the agreement of the CSIRTs  network whilst complying with its internal procedures.  General Info Notes  General info notes cover significant developments and announcements in cybersecurity. General info  notes are not a response to incidents or vulnerabilities but are rather explanatory notes e.g. on events that  reach a certain level of public and media attention. For general info notes, ENISA will consult the CSIRTs  network but also other resources as appropriate.  ENISA provides balanced and neutral information on such events, covering issues, points of action,  mitigation measures, summaries, related practices, etc. Hence, the objective of this work is to provide a  neutral overview of the state of play on an incident in a near-time manner.  Both types of Info Notes will be logically integrated with the cyber-threat information, thus building a  single interconnected knowledge base.  ENISA’s intention is to continue providing Info Notes as a reliable and continuous service to its  stakeholders in a timely manner.  Just as with ETL, ENISA will further continuously develop the dissemination efficiency of the procured  cyber-threat information Info Notes. For this purpose, available dissemination channels will be used to  enhance uptake among key stakeholders. In addition to the ENISA website, in 2019 Info Notes will be  disseminated via the ENISA ETL platform.  Output O.1.2.3 — Support incident-reporting activities in the EU (Scenario 1)  As EU-level incident-reporting obligations become more complex, developing efficient reporting schemes  across sectors and across geographical borders, while making sure they remain simple, pragmatic and  relevant for both the public and the private sector without increasing the cost of operation is one of the  objectives of the activities developed by ENISA in this sector.  Current and planned activities in this area include the following.   Incident notification in the telecom sector (Article 13a telecom package). Currently ENISA  facilitates the activities of the informal Article 13a expert group, keeping in touch with industry  and collecting and processing the incidents for the annual incident report. Further support is  needed as the telecom package is currently under review. The new EU electronic-communications  code (EECC) brings significant improvements to the security part along with the incident-reporting  framework.  ENISA programming document 2019-2021  final | December 2018  32   Incident notification for the trust-service providers (Article 19 eIDAS regulation). In 2019 ENISA will  continue receiving the annual incident reports from the competent authorities. ENISA will analyse  them and produce a consolidated, anonymised incident-analysis report. In addition, ENISA will  build on lessons learned from past incidents and recommend good practices to the Member  States. It will also continue engaging with the competent authorities towards a harmonised  implementation of this article and also engage with private-sector stakeholders to better  understand the needs and challenges of the sector.   Incident notification in the context of the NISD. Further guidelines and support are needed from  ENISA to facilitate the smooth implementation of the new provisions, using (where appropriate)  opportunities arising under the CEF. More specifically, ENISA can assist stakeholders in developing  sector-specific incident-reporting frameworks and procedures, develop cross-border incident- reporting frameworks, agree on the parameters and thresholds upon which an incident is  considered significant as well as the ex post analysis of the reported data, make inventories of  suitable tools available etc. ENISA contributes to ensuring the efficient flow of voluntary  information at MS request and to establish common situational awareness in the event of a large- scale cross-border incident.  ENISA has significant expertise on incident reporting at EU level through the work carried out with  Member States and telecoms providers on the transposition of Article 13a of the 2009 telecommunications  framework directive. ENISA also contributed to the interpretation of Article 19 of the eIDAS regulation and  now helps trust-service providers in implementing this article. ENISA will also monitor the developments of  the EECC and include relative tasks upon approval for the legislation.  Output O.1.2.4 — Regular technical reports on cybersecurity situation (Scenario 2)  As the frequency and magnitude of cybersecurity incidents in the EU increase, the Commission recognised  the need to improve shared situation awareness amongst EU and MS policymakers. In particular, the  Commission requested the following in the blueprint.  ‘As part of the regular cooperation at technical level to support Union situational awareness, ENISA should  on a regular basis prepare the EU cybersecurity technical situation report on incidents and threats, based  on publicly available information, its own analysis and reports shared with it by MS CSIRTs (on a voluntary  basis) or NISD single points of contact, European cybercrime centre (EC3) at Europol and CERT-EU and  where appropriate EU intelligence and situation centre (INTCEN) at the European External Action Service  (EEAS). The report should be made available to the relevant instances of the Council, the Commission, the  High representative of the EU (HR/VP) and the CSIRTs network.  The production of such situation reports will leverage many other existing and future ENISA WP activities.  For this particular output, ENISA will produce a summary report of all EU cybersecurity technical situation  reports produced throughout the year. Pending implementation of the blueprint, ENISA will also organise a  workshop with EU, MS and sectorial stakeholders to present the results and gather feedback on ways to  improve the collection, analysis, presentation and distribution mechanisms of the EU cybersecurity  technical situation reports.  In addition to the above, ENISA will create cyberthreat information reports on a quarterly basis. Such  reports will be in par with ENISA Info notes and are the intermediate reports towards the ETL report, the  end year CTI report. Taken together and under the assumption that this information will be prepared in a  structurally consistent manner, it will comprise a unique open-source CTI. It is expected that such an  offering will significantly enhance the capabilities of organisations with low cybersecurity maturity. And  ENISA programming document 2019-2021  final | December 2018  33  will contribute to them having a better understanding of the threat level and being in a position to better  protect themselves.  ENISA will also support the dissemination of CTI good practices. This will enable stakeholders to better  address CTI in their business, vendors to create usable CTI offerings and tools and governmental  organisations to better engage in CTI brokerage. All this will enable CTI usage and will thus contribute to a  more proper, more agile adaptation to real cyber threats.  Objective 1.3. Research, development and innovation (RDI)  Output O.1.3.1 — Supporting cPPP in establishing priorities for EU research & development  (Scenario 1)  ENISA will continue providing analysis of the areas covered by the NISD, the cybersecurity package, the  Commission decision on cPPP and the outcomes of relevant Horizon2020 projects e.g. the CSA projects  (cyber watching, AEGIS and EU-Unity) and will aim to show where R & D activities funded in the context of  H2020, CEF, Transits and GEANT would achieve the greatest impact. On cybersecurity aspects related to  the GDPR, ENISA will work in conjunction with the respective Commission services. ENISA will monitor and  analyse cybersecurity-related directives and initiatives in various sectors (e.g. space, maritime, defence,  transport, automotive) and assess the specific threat landscape in these critical sectors.  ENISA will work closely with ECSO and cPPP on cybersecurity in order to align the work being carried with  the ENISA work programme. In addition, ENISA will continue to support NAPAC by offering a secretariat  function.  ENISA will look into adapting the current best practice and guidelines for protecting EU systems and  networks, services, IoT and cloud ecosystems and supply chains according to the evolving threats. As well  as building specific use cases that can be adopted by the IT security community.  Additionally, ENISA will continue supporting and advising the Commission and organisations in this area  (e.g. ECSO), other agencies (e.g. EDA, ESA), industrial communities as well as the Member States, to meet  their goals by bringing its concrete NIS policy expertise. Relevant contributions will also be made on the  proposal on the creation of the cybersecurity competence network with a European cybersecurity research  and competence centre (32).  Objective 1.4. Response to Article 14 requests under expertise activity (33)  Output O.1.4.1 — Response to requests under expertise activity (Scenario 1)  Article 14 requests allow the MS and EU institutions alike to make direct requests to ENISA when seeking  assistance or advice on specific activities or policy issues. Under this objective, ENISA will address all the  requests related to its area the area of expertise.  The type of outcome and the performance indicators will be set out during the execution year of the work  programme together with the requester.

ENISA programming document 2019-2021  final | December 2018  36  Activity 2 — Policy. Promote network and information security as an EU policy priority  Objective 2.1. Supporting EU policy development  Output O.2.1.1 — Support the preparatory policy discussions in the area of certification of products  and services (Scenario 1)  Taking due account of recent legislative and policy developments, including the draft cybersecurity act.  ENISA will continue working towards meeting preparatory requirements for the certification framework for  ICT security products and services by e.g. promoting mutual recognition or harmonisation of certification  practices up to a certain level, in line with the proposed act. Any planned activity in the area of  cybersecurity certification will respect existing national efforts and interests as well as the principle that,  wherever possible, decisions must be taken at the level of government closest to citizens (‘subsidiarity’) as  it applies in the area of certification, while taking into consideration the ongoing legislative process.  ENISA will provide support for the Commission and the Member States in the policy area on certification of  products and services within the scope of the approved cybersecurity act and for better preparing for the  new EU cybersecurity-certification framework for products and services. Within this framework ENISA will  enter the final year of preparations in anticipation of the coming into force of the cybersecurity act. ENISA  will subsequently seek to stimulate the interaction and involvement of MS governments as well as public  policy and industry stakeholders in the emerging EU certification framework. Transitioning from policy  preparation to policy implementation in good cooperation with the MS governments is demanding for  ENISA as it is conditional to final approval of the cybersecurity act.  ENISA will provide support for the organisation of the EU cybersecurity-certification framework  (organisational and IT systems), supporting the European Commission in its role in the European  cybersecurity-certification group and analysing aspects of functional equivalence of existing certification  schemes across the EU (at the MS as well as the EU level) with the emerging EU certification framework for  facilitating the transition to the new EU framework. ENISA will continue to interact with key stakeholders  associated with the EU cybersecurity-certification framework.  Objective 2.2. Supporting EU policy implementation  Output O.2.2.1 — Recommendations supporting implementation of the eIDAS regulation  (Scenario 1)  ENISA will continue its work on supporting public and private bodies in implementing the eIDAS regulation  by addressing technological aspects and building blocks for trust services. Aspects to be covered will be  agreed with the Commission and MS through the eIDAS expert group. Interacting with the private sector  will enhance the ability of ENISA to make further meaningful contributions to this area. In implementing  the cybersecurity act, ENISA will support the eID efforts of the MS and the Commission. The eIDAS expert  group will be consulted for approval on specific ENISA implementation guidelines and technical  recommendations addressing operational aspects of trust-service providers, conformity-assessment bodies  and supervisory authorities. ENISA will continue to accumulate experience of best-practice and state-of- the-art progress, seeking to emphasise implementation and interoperability aspects. These  recommendations will complement the existing knowledge base that ENISA created for the trust-service  providers. At the same time, ENISA will take account of recommendations and standards being developed  by CEN/Cenelec, ETSI and the ISO and seek to avoid both duplication of work and potentially opposing  approaches. In this regard, ENISA will support the Commission in assessing the relevant standards by  ENISA programming document 2019-2021  final | December 2018  37  reviewing their meeting of requirements of the eIDAS regulation. Furthermore, ENISA will continue to  support the Commission in the implementation of qualified-website-authentication certificates, in  particular by using them for their webpages. Other relevant areas include the non-qualified level of trust  services, mobile services etc.  Output O.2.2.2 — Supporting the implementation of the work programme of the cooperation group  under the NISD (Scenario 1)  ENISA will leverage its expertise and good practice, among others, on critical information infrastructures,  national cybersecurity strategies, CSIRTs, baseline security requirements and incident notification in  numerous sectors (energy, transport, finance etc.), standardisation, ICT certification and others to  contribute to the work of the cooperation group. That would be by reusing or customising existing results  or by developing new, specific results meeting the needs and requirements of the cooperation group.  ENISA can analyse specific issues identified in the second biennial cooperation group work programme  (2018-2020), consult with MS competent authorities, and develop recommendations and suggestions that  would allow the Commission and Member States to make informed decisions on NIS matters. It could be  useful to use the work carried out on OES, DSPs and other service interdependencies as a reference for the  NIS cooperation group work stream on cross-border dependencies.  ENISA will support the work of the Commission in resourcing capabilities on cybersecurity through CEF  (specifically for the national competent authorities under Objective 4 and for OES and DSP under  Objective 2), under NISD objectives.  ENISA will also take stock of the lessons learned from the first year of implementation of the NISD and  recommend good practices to the cooperation group and the Commission on the directive-transposition  process.  In addition, ENISA will continue its efforts supporting the Commission and MSs with the overview of the  NISD implementation and its evaluation by the Member States and the Commission.  Output O.2.2.3 — Assist MS in the implementation of OES and DSP security requirements  (Scenario 1)  Drawing from the experience of the NIS cooperation group, ENISA will assist MSs in the implementation of  OES and DSP security requirements by building on its knowledge and expertise in the area of security  requirements, identification criteria, security measures and notification requirements. ENISA will work  closely with Member States to identify cost effective practices and mature security frameworks.  In deriving such a set of common mechanisms, sector-specific needs are to be taken into account as these  are likely to introduce different priorities (for example, the relative importance of availability and integrity  is likely to be different in the energy sector from those in the banking sector, where different risks prevail).  ENISA will monitor the development of the NISD implementation (across all sectors in the MSs) and  identify possible priorities and tasks for those involved.  However, ENISA will take note of such specific requirements as and when they are identified during the  analysis phase and will then map them to the needs and requirements of DSPs and OES.  ENISA will also compare and validate the results with other relevant approaches in the area of OES (e.g.  Cybersecuirty Capability Maturity Model (C2M2), NICE Capability Maturity Model (NICE-CMM)) or the  generic IT models (e.g. ISO 27001) and interact with all important stakeholders from public as well as the  ENISA programming document 2019-2021  final | December 2018  38  private sector. In this line, online tools which map the security requirements with different approaches and  standards will be developed.  The proper validation of the proposed practices contribute to setting the basis for sufficient convergence  across the EU MSs. The existence of multiple legislation instruments (e.g. GDPR and sector-specific  legislation) with different security requirements on OES and DSP requires a concerted effort from  competent authorities regarding supervision and good-governance practices. In this light, ENISA will take  stock of existing initiatives addressing this problem and will bring together stakeholders from different  security domains to discuss the findings.  Output O.2.2.4 — Supporting the payment services directive (PSD) implementation (Scenario 1)  The second payment-services directive (PSD II) will revolutionise the finance sector and more specifically  the payments industry. It will affect everything from the way payments are made online, to what  information is sent when making a payment. The transposition of the directive was set as January 2018.  ENISA will continue its support for the European Banking Authority (EBA), the European Central Bank (ECB)  and relevant competent public and private stakeholders to develop guidelines and recommendations for  implementing the directive and explore NISD collaboration.  In this context ENISA will help the relevant authorities with presenting the security requirements and  incident-reporting status for each MS on PSD II implementing the directive in with the use of a web tool.  This work item builds on previous work of ENISA in the area of supporting activities in the NISD (WP 2015- 2017).  Output O.2.2.5 — Contribute to the EU policy in the area of privacy and data protection with policy  input on security measures (Scenario 1)  Within the scope of security measures required by the legal framework on personal data protection and  privacy as well as suitable provisions stemming from the draft cybersecurity act for the role of ENISA in this  area, ENISA will continue promoting trust and security in digital services by means of technical analysis on  the implementation of EU legislation addressing privacy and personal data protection. In particular,  aspects of the technical implementation of the GDPR and of the forthcoming privacy regulation will be  addressed. ENISA will support the implementation of the regulatory aspects related to cybersecurity by  making available policy, technical and organisational advice to the Commission in the area of security of  personal data and privacy confidentiality of communications for implementing security measures.  Moreover, ENISA analysis will discuss aspects of shaping technology according to GDPR and ePrivacy  provisions, such as for example data security, data minimisation, anonymisation and pseudonymisation,  privacy by design and by default, mobile applications as well as aspects of privacy standards.  ENISA will seek to bring together the data protection and privacy considerations on one hand with IT  security considerations in the product and services certification area on the other. ENISA will liaise with  stakeholders and policymakers as well as with competent authorities in the Member States and EU  institutions, to ensure that the network and information-security dimension of data protection and privacy  are considered in the EU while striving for synergies between privacy and security and assistance to key  stakeholders, namely the Commission and competent EU bodies.  Currently in its 7th edition, the Annual Privacy Forum (APF) — a conference that has grown to be cost-free  for ENISA in the last two editions — remains the instrument of choice to bring together key communities,  namely policy, academia and industry, in the broader area of privacy and data protection while focusing on  ENISA programming document 2019-2021  final | December 2018  39  privacy related application areas. Cooperation activities with European Data Protection Supervisor, the  European Data Protection Board and national data protection authorities will be further pursued.  Output O.2.2.6 — Guidelines for the European standardisation in ICT security (Scenario 1)  Building on its own policy work, existing standards and the requirements of the Member States, this  activity will seek to make available a gap analysis and/or provide guidance to implement existing NIS  standards. Additionally, ENISA manages the relationship it has developed with the EU standard-developing  organisations (SDOs) (CEN/Cenelec and ETSI) by contributing to their standardisation work at the strategic  and tactical levels (e.g. by joining the CSCG, observing relevant Technical and Conference programme  Committees etc.). New requirements associated primarily with the implementation and secondly  transposition of the EU legal instruments in place in the Member States will be taken into account,  including aspects of the NISD and the GDPR, as well as preparing for the coming into force of the draft  ePrivacy regulation, and the draft cybersecurity act, etc. This output will seek to analyse the gaps and  provide guidelines for, in particular, the development or repositioning of standards, facilitating the  promulgation and adoption of NIS standards. ENISA brings in this relationship its technical and organisation  NIS know-how which can be further leveraged into standards in extending or assessing them to render  them more appropriate to stakeholders and more compliance with the prevailing regulatory framework.  By bringing in its concrete NIS policy expertise, ENISA will produce ‘how to’ and ‘what else’ guides in an  effort to contribute to European standardisation.  In carrying out this work, ENISA will consult with the Member States, industry and standards developing  organisations (e.g. ETSI, CEN, Cenelec), as well as Commission services and agencies with policy  competence as appropriate.  Output O.2.2.7 — Supporting the implementation of European Electronic Communications  Code (EECC) (Scenario 1)  The proposal for the EECC brings substantial improvements to the security component. Built on the general  objectives such as ensuring a high level of security of networks and services, adapting to technological  changes and ensuring consistency with other regulatory initiatives (GDPR, NISD), the EECC, once adopted, is  expected to bring more harmonisation at EU level and several improvements as regards the security part,  such as the following.   Broadening the scope to include also number-independent (Ni) interpersonal communications  services (ICS) (also called over-the-top services (OTTs)).   A comprehensive design of security (focused on availability, integrity, confidentiality and  authenticity of the data and services), that will result in more types of incidents being reported.   Clear criteria to be taken into account when notifying incidents (e.g. socioeconomic impact).  After its approval, ENISA will provide support for Member States and the industry, so as to assure a proper  and efficient implementation of the new requirements in the EECC. ENISA will engage its Article 13a expert  group and the private sector in order to establish guidelines and good practices that will facilitate the  implementation process. ENISA will also further facilitate the coordination of Member States to avoid  diverging national requirements that may create security risks and barriers to the internal market. ENISA  will closely monitor the development of the EECC and identify tasks and priorities for the concerned actors  accordingly.  ENISA programming document 2019-2021  final | December 2018  40  Output O.2.2.8– Supporting the sectorial implementation of the NISD (Scenario 2)  The key NISD obligations are currently implemented horizontally across all NISD sectors. The proposed  measures, namely incident reporting, security requirements and criteria for identifying OES, cover the  aspects which are common across all sectors. They aim at developing a baseline for all OES.  Sector-specific initiatives will have to use the horizontal obligations of the NISD and customise them to  address the specific needs and requirements of each sector. It is extremely important, at this stage, to  facilitate the sectorial implementation of the NISD in a consistent and consistent way. This way we ensure  proper deployment of horizontal measures within the NISD.  In this outcome ENISA will identify for all NISD sectors relevant public and private initiatives at national and  EU level and assess their maturity. ENISA, in close collaboration with the cooperation group (e.g. based on  widely accepted criteria for the prioritisation of the criticality of essential services) and the expertise of  ENISA in given sectors (e.g. health, transport), will select two NISD sectors in sectorial implementation.  In that context ENISA will work with all relevant stakeholders, public and private, in each sector and  subsector, to identify whether and how to customise the horizontal NISD measures. ENISA will do that by  taking under consideration the sectorial specifications, standards, and existing initiatives/schemes.  ENISA will use its expertise and knowledge developed within the NISD (WP 2016, WP 2017, and WP 2018)  and other CIIP-related activities.  ENISA will work under the cooperation group, with MS experts.  Output O.2.2.9 — Hands on tasks in the area of certification of products and services (Scenario 2)  Having adopted the finally approved cybersecurity act and its component on certification, ENISA will  support the Commission and the Member States by carrying out hands on tasks in this area for assisting  them in deploying the framework.  Transitioning from policy preparation to policy implementation is a demanding action for ENISA and it will  include a framework for certification schemes, a support framework as well as structured interactions with  the stakeholders’ community and the tools required to carry out these functions.  Working in cooperation with MS certification supervisory authorities, the European cybersecurity- certification group and other key stakeholders, ENISA will set the stage for implementation by supporting  the functional equivalence of existing certification schemes across the EU (at the MS as well as the EU  level) with the emerging EU cybersecurity-certification framework for integrating existing schemes in the  new EU framework in a flexible way. ENISA will continue working with stakeholders to collect, establish  and understand expectations they have from the EU cybersecurity-certification framework. ENISA will  implement an action plan in order to fulfil a role in the emerging EU cybersecurity certification framework  for quickly taking up the new tasks emanating from the cybersecurity act along with the Member States.  Practical aspects to be considered include but are not limited to identifying new areas in certification,  recommendations on next steps to take at EU level, analysis of impact of certification for manufacturers,  governments and end-users, recommendations on prioritisation of schemes, review of overlaps and gaps  across proposed schemes etc. Areas for possible cybersecurity-certification schemes include IoT, Consumer  Electronics and Cloud Computing, depending of course on requests received by the designated initiator i.e.  ENISA programming document 2019-2021  final | December 2018  41  MS and the Commission (36). ENISA will carry out support activities in the area of certification and if  needed, it will organise its own events in line with the finally approved cybersecurity act bringing together  key stakeholders. There is also a certain degree of internal preparatory work in IT infrastructure and  organisational preparation including management of third party intellectual property rights that will need  to be sorted out, to duly support the EU framework.  Objective 2.3. Response to Article 14 requests under policy activity (37)  Output O.2.3.1 — Response to requests under policy activity (Scenario 1)  Article 14 requests allow the MS and EU institutions to make direct requests to ENISA seeking assistance or  advice on specific activities. Under this objective, ENISA will address all the requests related to the area of  policy development and policy implementation.  The type of outcome and the performance indicators will be set out during the execution year of the work  programme together with the requester.  Although, by definition, it is not possible to accurately estimate the exact number or the output and  outcome of these requests for 2018, the allocated resources are indicated in the summary section at the  end.

Support Europe maintaining state-of-the-art network and  information-security capacities  Objective 3.1. Assist Member State capacity building  Output O.3.1.1 — Update and provide technical training for MS and EU bodies (Scenario 1)  In 2019 most of the activities in this area target at maintaining and extending the collection of good  practice guidelines and training for CSIRT and other operational personnel. ENISA will support the  development of MS incident-response preparedness by providing good practice guidance on key elements  of NIS capacity building with a focus on CSIRT training and services in order to improve skills of CSIRT  teams and their personnel. ENISA will further build upon successful work in the area of ‘training  methodologies and impact assessment’.  In detail, ENISA will continue to provide an update of the training material, according to the findings of the  stocktaking study for training in NISD sectors and provide a new set of training material based on emerging  technologies in order to improve MS CSIRTs skills and capacities to efficiently manage cybersecurity  events. A special emphasis is placed on supporting MS CSIRTs and EU bodies with concrete advice (like  good practice material) and concrete action (like CSIRT training). ENISA will as well offer, upon their  request, direct support to single Member States to provide technical training and advisories.  In 2019, ENISA will further enhance its methodology, seminars and training on: a) cyber-crisis management  and b) the organisation and management of exercises. This activity will build on the current developed  material and infrastructure for on-site and online training on these subjects. In addition, this activity will  cover the delivery of this training upon request.  Output O.3.1.2 — Support EU MS in the development and assessment of NCSs (Scenario 1)  The NISD sets as priority for the MS to adopt a national NIS strategy and to monitor its implementation.  Since 2017 all 28 MS have published a national NIS strategy. However, in order to align the objectives of  the existing national cybersecurity strategies (NCSs) to the requirements of the NISD, many MS will update  their current NCSs.  ENISA programming document 2019-2021  final | December 2018  44  ENISA will continue assisting EU MS to develop their capabilities in the area of NCSs. ENISA, building on  previous years’ work in this area, will assist MS to deploy existing good practices in the related areas and  offer targeted and focused assistance on specific NCSS objectives (e.g. CIIP, creation of PPPs etc.). A  priority in this area will be to ensure that NCSS adequately reflect the priorities and requirements of the  NISD. Each year ENISA focuses on one of the objectives of the strategy (e.g. collaboration, CIIP,  governance).  ENISA will this year, focus on a new objective trending in the NCSS: innovation and start-ups. This derives  from the need for the private sector to have incentives to invest on cybersecurity. This is widely depicted  in the EU National Cybersecurity strategies as the engagement of the private sector that will pave the way  for a digital single market in the EU and for a strong cybersecurity role at international level. ENISA will  investigate the activities the MS take under this objective and examine best practices and new potential  incentives.  ENISA will continue supporting MS in evaluating and assessing their NCSS, as well as, their NIS initiatives.  ENISA will update its NCSS assessment methodology and will validate it with public and private  stakeholders. Then ENISA will make this assessment methodology available to MS to use and remain at  their disposal should they need assistance in implementing it.  Finally, ENISA will enhance the NCSS map with additional valuable information related to the NISD creating  an information hub. As for the past 5 years, ENISA will organise the annual NCSS workshop focusing  validating the findings of the study.  Output O.3.1.3 — Support EU MS in their incident-response development (Scenario 1)  In 2019 ENISA will concentrate its efforts on assisting MS to support their incident-response capabilities by  providing an updated view on the CSIRT landscape and development in Europe. In close cooperation with  the NISD CSIRTs network, ENISA will support the development of MS incident-response capabilities by  providing recommendations on key dimensions of NIS capability building with a focus on the development  and efficient functioning of national and sectorial CSIRTs. ENISA will as well offer, upon their request,  direct support to single Member States to assess and improve their incident-response capabilities,  including assistance in the preparatory phase of CEF proposals.  The main objectives of this output in 2019 is to help MS and another ENISA’s incident-response  stakeholders, such as the EU institutions, bodies and agencies, to develop, extend and deploy their  incident-response capabilities and services in order to meet the ever growing challenges to secure their  networks. Another objective of this output is to further develop and apply ENISA recommendations for  CSIRT baseline capabilities and maturity framework. As a continuous effort, ENISA will continue supporting  cross-border CSIRT community projects, tools development as well as the global dialogue about common  definitions and maturity framework in the incident-response domain.  Output O.3.1.4 — Support EU MS in the development of ISACs for the NISD Sectors (Scenario 2)  For many years ENISA works closely with the main OES in the EU. It has set up several sectorial expert  groups covering sectors such as maritime, finance and health (38). Through this effort and based on this  experience with sectors or sector-specific topics like ICS/SCADA, ENISA holds a unique position in the EU to  fulfil a key role on EU-focused ISACs. It is a natural role for ENISA and continuation of its activities in the  last 10 years to coordinate, in conjunction with CEF funding, the further development, implementation and  (38) https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/critical-information-infrastructures-and-services  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/critical-information-infrastructures-and-services  ENISA programming document 2019-2021  final | December 2018  45  continuation of EU ISACs in the next decade. ENISA is already cooperating with the Commission in  developing the ISAC facilities manager concept arising from proposals to develop ISACs reference in the  CEF Telecom 2018 work programme (39).  ENISA has been working on the topic of CIIP since 2010, so it would make sense to have a special role in  pan-European sectorial ISAC. Some examples would include:   EU aviation ISAC: ENISA plays a key role in the (further) development of this ISAC. Its added value is  mainly based on the network and the specific expertise in the sector (previous and existing studies). The  members consist of airlines and carriers. ENISA is an associate member.   EU Energy ISAC: ENISA plays a key role in the development and professionalisation of this ISAC. ENISA is  a full member and is responsible for providing expertise through organising webinars and educational  sessions for its members. In September 2017, it hosted the ISAC meeting in Athens. The EE-ISAC  members are preferably, and only, operators.   EU Financial Institutions ISAC: This ISAC is the oldest and ENISA has been actively involved for many  years. It supports the ISAC, for example by hosting the mailing list. ENISA’s involvement is mainly to  legitimise EU participation. ENISA is an observer.   EU Rail ISAC: ENISA is facilitating the European railway operators (infrastructure managers and railway  undertakings) creating the European Rail ISAC. Currently more than 23 European stakeholders and the  European Railway Agency (ERA) participate in the ISAC. ENISA offer experience and support.  The September 2017 Joint Communication states: ‘Some first steps have been taken in respect of specific  critical sectors such as aviation, through the creation of EASA, and energy, by developing ISACs. The  Commission will contribute in full to this approach with support from ENISA, with an acceleration needed in  particular for sectors providing essential services as identified in the NISD’.  ENISA will support MS with the creation of national ISACs through engaging all relevant stakeholders:  national competent bodies, the private sector i.e. OES or manufacturers and other relevant bodies and  through assisting, on request, the development of proposals, by Member State endorsed entities, for  funding through CEF. ENISA will use the opportunity to continue promoting CEF resourcing under the  Telecom Call (Objective 2 supporting OES) to further support OES participating in the ISAC. ENISA will also  explore the possibility of synergies across national ISACs (national ISAC to national ISAC) as well as across EU  sectorial ones. This will help the private companies operating in numerous MS to have increased benefits  from such a collaboration.  Objective 3.2. Support EU institutions’ capacity building.  Output O.3.2.1. Representation of ENISA on the Steering Board of CERT-EU and coordination with  other EU agencies using the CERT-EU service (Scenario 1)  In December 2017, the operations of CERT-EU were formalised by way of a new Interinstitutional  Arrangement. The Members of the Steering Board comprise the participating EU institutions and ENISA  which participates as the representative of EU agencies that use the services of CERT-EU.  In this context ENISA will actively participate in the Steering Board of CERT-EU, liaise with the EU agencies  on operational issues related to CERT-EU’s activities in particular through the ICTAC (ICT Advisory  Committee) of the EU agencies and generally to ensure that the viewpoints of the agencies are adequately  (39) https://ec.europa.eu/inea/en/connecting-europe-facility/cef-telecom/apply-funding/2018-cef-telecom-calls-proposals  https://ec.europa.eu/inea/en/connecting-europe-facility/cef-telecom/apply-funding/2018-cef-telecom-calls-proposals  ENISA programming document 2019-2021  final | December 2018  46  represented. ENISA will also report in to the CERT-EU steering board on the evolution of services required  by the agencies.  Output O.3.2.2. Cooperation with relevant EU bodies on initiatives covering NIS dimension related to  their missions (Scenario 1)  Already since 2017, ENISA has increased its cooperation efforts with a number of EU bodies. Notable  examples are the collaboration with CERT-EU in the context of the WannaCry incident as well as the  cooperation in the context of CyCon between Cyber Europe, Cyber Coalition and Locked Shields, and its  contribution for the preparation of the tabletop exercise conducted in the context of the Estonian  Presidency.  In this context, in 2019 ENISA will intensify its cooperation efforts and liaise with the relevant EU bodies (40)  (including EASA, CERT-EU, EDA — including civil/defence cooperation — etc.).  Objective 3.3. Assist in improving private sector capacity building and general awareness  In close collaboration with Member States and with the private sector, ENISA will help the public to gain  essential cybersecurity knowledge and skills to help protect their digital lives. Aspects like cybersecurity  culture and insurance will be further analysed.  In 2018, activities will include promoting the annual ECSM and working with the Member States delivering  projects like the cybersecurity challenges as well as national initiatives, upon request from Member States.  Output O.3.3.1 — European cybersecurity challenges (ECSC) (Scenario 1)  Both the growing need for IT security professionals and skills shortage are widely acknowledged. To help  solve this, ENISA is supporting national cybersecurity competitions for students, security professionals and  even non-IT professionals, with the goal to find cyber talents and encourage all of them to pursue a career  in cybersecurity.  Thus, in order to promote capacity building and awareness in NIS among youngsters and future cybersecurity  experts in the EU MS, ENISA will continue to promote and advise EU MS on running national ‘Cybersecurity  Challenge’ competitions.  ENISA will also continue to support the planning and development of the ECSC 2019 final. The goal for 2019  will be to further increase the interest in this type of events by promoting excellence in the form of cyber  competitions  Output O.3.3.2 — European cybersecurity month (ECSM) deployment (Scenario 1)  The metrics built into the ECSM- European Cybersecurity Month have shown an increased number of  participants, and a better engagement level from year to year. This was made possible with the support of  a vibrant community. In 2019, ENISA will continue reaching out to Member States and the public alike.  Previously proposed pillars remain: support a multi-stakeholder governance approach; encouraging  (40) Memorandum of Understanding between The European Union Agency for Network and Information Security (ENISA), The European Defence Agency  (EDA), Europol’s European Cybercrime Centre (EC3), The Computer Emergency Response Team for the EU institutions, bodies and agencies (CERT-EU),  available at: https://www.eda.europa.eu/docs/default-source/documents/mou—eda-enisa-cert-eu-ec3—23-05-18.pdf  https://www.eda.europa.eu/docs/default-source/documents/mou---eda-enisa-cert-eu-ec3---23-05-18.pdf  ENISA programming document 2019-2021  final | December 2018  47  common public-private activities; assess the impact of activities, optimising and adapting to new  challenges as appropriate.  Output O.3.3.3 — Support EU MS in cybersecurity skills development (Scenario 2)  In 2019, ENISA will promote a series of new activities in the area of cybersecurity skill development which  will focus on identifying current national and EU-wide initiatives. The main output of this activity will be a  database of existing services and programmes in the EU that aim to enhance cybersecurity skills among EU  public in general, and cybersecurity experts in particular.

Foster the emerging European network and information- security community  Objective 4.1. Cyber-crisis cooperation  Output O.4.1.1 — Planning of cyber Europe 2020 and cyber SOPEx (Scenario 1)  In 2020, ENISA will organise the fifth pan-European cyber exercise, Cyber Europe 2020 (CE2020). In 2019  ENISA will prepare the plan of CE2020. This exercise will closely follow up and build upon the lessons  learned and actions from previous exercises, such as CE2018.  CE2020 will focus on testing capabilities and procedures, namely large-scale incident management  cooperation procedures at EU and national-levels. The crisis escalation scenario will be realistic and  focused in order to capture better how incidents are managed and cooperation happens in real life. The  exercise will include explicit scenarios for the CSIRTs network, single points of contact and competent  authorities set up under the NISD, including focusing on one or more of the essential sectors. Also there  will be designs to exercise the various aspects of the cyber-crisis-collaboration blueprint. Depending on the  availability of resources in 2020 ENISA will also enhance the observer role (introduced in 2018) striving to  make best use of observers.  The high-level exercise programme brief will include the strategic dimensions of the exercise will be  prepared based on the lessons learned from CE2018, to drive the whole planning process. The exercise  brief will be given for comments and approval to ENISA’s MB after consultation with the MS Cooperation  Group and the CSIRTs network set up under the NISD. Following this ENISA will assemble group of planners  from the participating countries to work closely towards developing a detailed exercise plan (ExPlan) in  2019. ENISA will involve the group of planners in the relevant planning steps and take into account their  input towards a consented plan. The exercise planning will avoid overlaps with other major related  activities.  ENISA will consult MS and seek agreement of ENISA’s MB after consultation with the cooperation group  and the CSIRTs network set up under the NISD on a possible joint EU-NATO cyber exercise in the coming  year.  Finally, in 2019 ENISA will organise the Cyber SOPEx exercise (formerly known as EuroSOPEx) for the EU  public authorities’ points of contact, as these will be represented in the CSIRTs network only to keep and  even raise the momentum of cooperation in between them. As in previous years the exercise will be  planned with the support of representatives from the involved organisations. The exercise is expected  again to have as high-level goals to raise awareness of cooperation procedures, train participants in using  the cooperation infrastructures, such as the communication and information sharing and ultimately  contribute to increase trust within the CSIRTs network. Guidance should be found in the CSIRTs network on  planning the exercise. There will not be any private entities involved in this exercise.  ENISA programming document 2019-2021  final | December 2018  50  Output O.4.1.2 — Support activities for cyber exercises (Scenario 1)  Since 2014 ENISA started the development of the cyber exercise platform (CEP). CEP hosts a number of  services that ENISA offers to the Member States and EU institutions, such as: exercise organisation and  management, exercise playground with technical incidents, map of exercises and hosting the exercise  development community. In the interests of efficiency, ENISA will seek to align the CEP with the  MeliCERTes facility so that cyber exercises can be integrated in the main operational cooperation platform  under the CSIRTs network.  In addition, new content and exercise incident challenges and material will be developed in order to keep  up the interest of the stakeholders and make CEP a central tool in cybersecurity exercising for all  stakeholders. The CEP platform opens new opportunities for ENISA to enlarge the user base and thus offer  to the operational cybersecurity communities opportunities to exercise and gain experience and  knowledge. One way to develop such exercise incident material will be through the engagement of the  experts’ community.  Finally, following up on possible requests for support by competent authorities, EU bodies and other  relevant organisations to plan and setup technical cyber exercises (CTEx), or other types of exercises,  utilising the technical incidents and the gaming infrastructure in the CEP.  Output O.4.1.3 — Support activities for cyber-crisis management (Scenario 1)  Since 2015, ENISA offers the secretariat to the MS developing EU-level standard cooperation procedures,  which formed the basis of the CSIRTs network SOPs. ENISA will continue to support Member States in the  implementation of the cyber-crisis-collaboration blueprint. In particular, ENISA will further support the  maintenance of the CISRT network SOPs.  The 2016 Communication ‘Strengthening Europe’s Cyber Resilience System and Fostering a Competitive  and Innovative Cybersecurity Industry’ encouraged Member States to make the most out of the NISD  cooperation mechanisms and to enhance cross-border cooperation related to preparedness for a large- scale cyber incident.  The 2017 blueprint called for the establishment of ‘practical implementation guidelines as regards the  integration of their national crisis management and cybersecurity entities and procedures into existing EU  crises management mechanisms, namely the Integrated Political Crisis Response (IPCR) and European  External Action Service Crisis Response Mechanism (EEAS CRM). In particular, Member States should  ensure that appropriate structures are in place to enable the efficient flow of information between their  national crisis management authorities and their representatives at EU level in the context of EU crisis  mechanisms’.  In this light, ENISA will support individual Member States in setting up, improving and testing their own  cyber-crisis management frameworks in order to ensure a smooth adoption of the blueprint and to foster  synergies in crisis management practices across Member States. ENISA will support the cross-border  cooperation between Member States, relevant authorities and facilitate the engagement with the crisis  management framework at national and EU level. Activities offered will range from remote training on  crisis management and public affairs handling, on-site workshops, document revision and tabletop  exercises, including opportunities in CE2020 for testing national crisis management structures.  Last, building upon the after action report from Cyber Europe 2018 and in an effort to improve crisis  management practices at sectorial level, ENISA will draft a report on cyber-crisis management practices in  the aviation sector.  ENISA programming document 2019-2021  final | December 2018  51  Output O.4.1.4 — Supporting the implementation of the information hub (Scenario 2)  Decision-supporting intelligence in the cybersecurity domain is scarce, despite today’s security information  overload (42). ENISA is at the crossroads of most if not all public-private, cross-sector cybersecurity  communities in Europe, from the technical to the strategic level. As indicated in the Commission  communication on building strong cybersecurity for the EU (43), ENISA serves as ‘the focal point for  information and knowledge in the cybersecurity community’. As a result, ENISA is in a unique position to  leverage its network to gather information, process it and foster timely, tailored and highly relevant  situational awareness to support decision-making in both the public and the private European sectors, as  recommended by the Commission in the blueprint:  ‘As part of the regular cooperation at technical level to support European Union situational awareness,  ENISA should on a regular basis prepare the EU cybersecurity technical situation report on incidents and  threats, based on publicly available information, its own analysis and reports shared with it by MS CSIRTs  (on a voluntary basis) or NISD single points of contact, European cybercrime centre (EC3) at Europol and  CERT- EU and where appropriate the EU intelligence and situation centre at the EEAS. The report should be  made available to the relevant instances of the Council, the Commission, the HRVP and the CSIRTs  network’.  In order to support the drafting of these reports and process meaningfully the massive inputs they require,  ENISA has developed in 2018 a prototype to perform automatic classification of documents as well as  simple automatic generation of reports by applying Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning  techniques. This prototype is the first brick of a toolset meant to assist in the development of EU  cybersecurity situation reports, supporting a steady increase and offering guarantees in production time,  quality and consistency.  For this particular output, ENISA will leverage the experience gained in drafting EU Cybersecurity Technical  Situation Reports with the prototype to further develop the Natural Language Processing features in order  for the tool to transition from paragraph-based proposals to the production of meaningful sentences.  Similarly, this experience will be leveraged to further develop the Machine Learning algorithms of the  prototype to allow for a significant increase in number and type of information sources.  Output O.4.1.5 — Supporting the implementation of the cyber-crisis-collaboration blueprint  (Scenario 2)  ENISA will support EU institutions in the implementation of the cyber-crisis-collaboration blueprint. As  specified in the blueprint: ‘The EU cybersecurity crisis response framework should in particular identify the  relevant […]EU institutions […]at all necessary levels — technical, operational, strategic/political and  develop, where necessary, standard operating procedures that define the way in which these cooperate  within the context of EU crisis management mechanisms. Emphasis should be placed on enabling the  exchange of information without undue delay and coordinating the response during large-scale  cybersecurity incidents and crises.’  In particular, ENISA will assist the Commission and the Member States in further developing bilateral and  multilateral procedures for cyber-crisis cooperation with:  (42) Scott J., Spaniel D.

ENISA will drive working groups to initiate or further develop these procedures in the context of the  blueprint, from establishing emergency directories and update processes to structuring cooperation  activities during crises. This is what the blueprint calls as priorities.  ENISA will assist Member States to engage EU cybersecurity crisis response framework with national  cybersecurity crisis response frameworks.  Furthermore, upon request or emerging needs, ENISA will organise workshops and/or tabletop exercises to  validate that these procedures allow for the exchange of information without undue delay, before their  use either in real life or in larger exercises such as Cyber Europe.  Objective 4.2. CSIRT and other NIS community building  Output O.4.2.1 — EU CSIRTs network secretariat and support for EU CSIRTs network community  building (Scenario 1)  ENISA will continue its support to the Commission and Member States in the implementation of the NISD,  in particular in the area of CSIRTs. As part of this activity, ENISA will continue its tasks as the secretariat of  the CSIRTs network and actively support its functioning by suggesting ways to improve cooperation and  trust building among CSIRTs. ENISA will also support this cooperation by developing and providing  guidance and good practices in the area of operational community efforts, such as on information  exchange and secure communication, on request by the members of the CSIRTs network. In particular,  ENISA will be proactive in stimulating discussions within the network and will aim to provide content to  support discussions on policy and technical initiatives according to the CSIRTs network own work  programme (action plan -midterm goals and objectives).  In addition, ENISA will take an active role to support CSIRTs in the CSIRTs network in activities relevant to  the CEF work programme. ENISA will actively support teams in testing and use of the CSP cooperation  mechanism for CSIRTs, known as MeliCERTes of the cybersecurity DSI.  Trust is an important asset for CSIRT operations therefore ENISA will continue to improve the level of trust  in the network by providing trust building exercises and events in coordination with the CSIRTs network  governance.  ENISA will further improve, develop and secure the CSIRTs network infrastructure for its member’s smooth  collaboration and administration use (CSIRTs network portal and other communication means).  ENISA programming document 2019-2021  final | December 2018  53  Output O.4.2.2 — Support the fight against cybercrime and collaboration between CSIRTs and law  enforcement (Scenario 1)  In 2019, ENISA will continue supporting the cooperation between the CSIRT and the law-enforcement  communities and the extensions that this collaboration may have to the judiciary. ENISA will continue its  effort to support the EU-wide objective on fight against cybercrime and continue liaising with various  stakeholders at EU (e.g. Europol and possibly Eurojust), as well as with select stakeholders at MS level.  In particular, in 2019 ENISA will collect input from key stakeholders and prepare a roadmap to further  enhance the cooperation between the CSIRTs and the law enforcement along with their interaction with  the judiciary. The roadmap will not necessarily be made public; it is likely to be distributed instead to select  stakeholders. In addition, ENISA will co-organise together with Europol/EC3 the annual workshop for  national and governmental CSIRTs and their LEA counterparts.  Output O.4.2.3 — Supporting the implementation and development of MeliCERTes platform  (Scenario 1)  By the end of 2019, ENISA will take over the central component of MeliCERTes, which is destined to be the  primary collaboration platform between participating Member States CSIRTs and which is oriented to  enlarge EU MS preparedness, cooperation and coordination to effectively respond to emerging cyber  threats as well as to cross-border incidents. ENISA will also work together with the Commission to set out  (a) the extent of support for the implementation of MeliCERTes running in the CSIRTs premises and (b) the  support for the maintenance of the underlying codebase of the MeliCERTes system. Based on this work,  we will establish corresponding procedures and service level agreement (SLAs) for the support and work  with the Commission to ensure that the code base is correctly supported. In particular ENISA with the  endorsement of the Commission will lead on the development and finalisation of a sustainable governance  arrangement for MeliCERTes with the enabling legal requirements for the participating Member States.  ENISA also will support the work of the Commission in resourcing capabilities on cybersecurity through CEF  calls under the objectives of the NISD, including assistance in the preparatory phase of CEF proposals  related with the support of MeliCERTes platform.  Due to the sensitivity of the data and the level of trust required by our stakeholders, special care and  diligence is needed in order to correctly plan, deploy, administrate and maintain the different systems  related with MeliCERTes platform, therefore high standards of security must be reached in order to  provide internal and external secure operation capabilities, continuous integration of the software and  support to users.  During 2019, ENISA will deploy different systems and processes with the aim of being able to support,  maintain and develop the platform and related activities, including collaboration, involvement and  alignment on cyber exercises and on the CSIRTs network.

Management and compliance  Management  The executive director is responsible for the overall management of ENISA. The executive director has a  personal assistant.  To support the executive director, the, MB secretariat will continue the administration of the MB meetings  and the administrative correspondence that takes place between meetings, including the management of  the MB portal. In 2019, MB secretariat will continue to support the MB and the executive board in their  functions by providing secretariat assistance.  In relation to the MB, following the applicable rules, one or two (Scenario 2) ordinary meetings will be  organised during 2019 and informal meetings will be held as necessary. The MB portal will be supported  for EB and MB. In relation to the executive board, one formal meeting will be organised per quarter and  informal meetings when necessary.  The resources department (RD) oversees a variety of programmes, projects and services on the overall  management of ENISA, supporting the executive director Decision is areas as personnel, finance,  communications, press, purchasing, technology, facilities management, health, safety, security, protocol,  liaison with local authorities, etc.  The aim of the RD is to provide this assurance and at the same time provide the best level of efficiency and  use of the resources that are made available for ENISA. This also includes coordination with the European  Commission Internal Audit Service (IAS), European Court of Auditors (ECA), European Ombudsman,  European Commission, European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF), DG Human Resources and Security, DG Budget,  DG Communications Networks, Content and Technology, etc. All internal policies related to transparency,  anti-fraud policy, whistle-blowers protection, declarations of interests, etc. are addressed within this  activity.  RD strives to maintain and increase the efficiency and effectives of ENISA, and provide continuous  contribution to the ENISA strategy both internally and externally seeking the optimal solutions for  delivering on the mandate of ENISA and provide the required assurance in compliance.  The aim is to enable ENISA with adequate and modern procedures and tools to minimise the resources  across ENISA maximising the intended delivery of the work programme and statutory commitments.  The core operations department (COD) coordinates the delivery of the core activities of ENISA. As such,  the main role of the COD is to deliver activities A1-A4 of this work programme. The COD also includes the  policy office and the public affairs team and the support of the permanent stakeholders group (PSG) and  national liaison officers (NLO) network is also carried out within COD.  Policy office  Through the policy office, ENISA initiates and further develops strategic cooperation with relevant  stakeholders active in cybersecurity community. For instance, ENISA engages in policy and strategy  discussions with political and policy decision-makers (by participating or organising e.g. MEP breakfasts).  ENISA programming document 2019-2021  final | December 2018  57  Furthermore ENISA engages and further develops strategic relationships with e.g. specific industry sectors  at decision-making level, and identifies the strategic issues on cybersecurity. Some of the results of these  activities of the policy office are published as opinion papers on ENISA webpage. Besides these activities,  more details of the activities delivered by policy office and Public Affairs team are detailed in Objective 5.2  Engagement with stakeholders and international activities.  Quality management is part of the policy office. ENISA implements a quality management system (QMS) to  support its regulatory and strategic goals by means of a quality management approach. The methodology  is based on the plan-do-check-act (PDCA) cycle, documented in a dedicated SOPs and applied accordingly.  Planning activities of ENISA, including single programming document preparation and work programme  coordination are part of policy office list of tasks.  Public affairs team  The public affairs team (PAT) is responsible for coordinating all activities with the media and press,  including press releases, news items and interviews. The PAT team also plays a major role in supporting  events attended by ENISA, ensuring that ENISA is well represented from a public affairs perspective, that  appropriate publicity material is available and, where appropriate, that booths are arranged and  supported.  Internal control  ENISA is aiming implement the new Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission  (COSO) framework 2013 as well as its new requirements in order to be align with the European  Commission.  The exercise will include the adoption of this framework by the MB as well as the assessment of the  compliance of these internal controls.  Internal Control reviews and evaluates risk management, governance and internal control processes of  ENISA, in order to provide, to the Senior Management, executive director and the MB, independent and  objective assurance.  IT  ENISA has launched a project that will run during the second half of 2018 in order to assess information- security risks and determine missing or out of date IT operational procedures. The project will provide a  roadmap and the changes needed in order to mitigate the identified risks. IT Advisory Committee has  decided that data the development of a datacentre recovery site is absolutely necessary in order to  enhance the IT service availability.  By end of 2019 it is expected that all business applications will be securely available on the most widely  used mobile devices. By this timeframe the platform consolidation should be complete and mature, with  adequate, flexible and advance reporting and monitoring tools. Is expected that 2018 will consolidate the  support technology in ENISA with modern, adequate and flexible business applications.  IT is supporting the implementation of a Stakeholders Relationship Management application that will  support the overall stakeholder’s management, communications and internal information sharing. This  application also involves an effective event management platform and internal case management to be  used as service internal client support for requests.  ENISA programming document 2019-2021  final | December 2018  58  Finance, accounting and procurement  The key objective is to ensure the compliance of the financial resources management within the applicable  rules, and in particular with the principle of sound financial management (namely the principles of  effectiveness, efficiency and economy) as set down in the financial regulation. The accounting principles  are followed in order to ensure that financial statements are presented in a manner that is relevant,  reliable, comparable and understandable. Furthermore, ENISA continues its good practice to close  accounts and process payments within the time frame.  ENISA continues the deployment of tools used to simplify and automate its work in the area of budget,  finance and procurement. Further development of in-house systems is expected in the future years to  improve the utilisation of resources, to have a better overview of all financial and procurement processes,  to provide better reporting and a high-level transparency. Internal policies will be revised to ensure that  they are up to date with the financial regulation and procurement rules, but also to implement a clear  guidance for internal use and optimise the available resources.  By mid-2019 an analysis will be made on the cost efficiency of outsourcing activities versus services  received. The aim is to reduce costs and streamline processes in order to achieve a high support level  towards ENISA. The unit strives to minimize the numbers of budget transfers during the year, having  planned and justified carry-overs.  Human resources  The ultimate goal of HR is to attract, select, develop and retain highly qualified staff, to put in place optimal  organisational structures, to promote a safe working environment, to create a culture that reflects ENISA’s  vision and values in which staff can give their best in achieving the organisation’s objectives.

Additionally, investment and efforts are focusing on several projects such as the acquisition of an E- recruitment tool, the development in closed collaboration with the European Commission’s HR management  information system (Sysper), the implication of the new GDPR regulation on HR matters, the security’s  upgrade and rationalisation of personnel files management, etc.  2019 might see ENISA growing with additional resources to fulfil its new mandate, having in mind the full  compliance achieved in 2018 of the agreed 5 % staff reduction (45). Most of the staff would be allocated to  operational needs with some allocation of staff to ensure sufficient capacity for ENISA’s enabling. It would  also imply from an HR perspective to take a strategic approach to its workforce requirements, with an  emphasis on attracting, selecting, developing and rewarding staff based on a Talent Management approach.

This  includes dealing with matters such as contracts, procurement, employment related matters, data  protection and corporate governance matters. The Legal Affairs function also includes dealing with  complaints to the European Ombudsman and representing ENISA before the European Court of Justice,  General Court or Civil Service Tribunal.  Data Protection Compliance tasks and Data protection Office  The main tasks of the Data Protection Officer (DPO) include (46) the following.   Inform and advise ENISA of its obligations as provided in the applicable legal provisions for the  protection of personal data and document this activity and the responses received.   Monitor the implementation and application of ENISA’s policies in relation to the protection of  personal data and the applicable legal framework for data protection.   Monitor the implementation and application of the applicable legal framework for the protection  of personal data at ENISA, including the requirements for data security, information of data  subjects and their requests in exercising their rights..  (45) ENISA reduced its staffing in 2018 in full compliance with the Art.27 of Interinstitutional Agreement of 02 December 2013 (2013/C 373/01) on 5 % staff  cut.  (46) The tasks of the DPO are explicitly mandated in Regulation (EU) 2018/1725 of the European Parliament and of the  Council of 23 October 2018 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data by the  Union institutions, bodies, offices and agencies and on the free movement of such data, and repealing Regulation (EC) No  45/2001 and Decision No 1247/2002, available at: https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal- content/EN/TXT/?uri=uriserv:OJ.L_.2018.295.01.0039.01.ENG&toc=OJ:L:2018:295:TOC'  https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=uriserv:OJ.L_.2018.295.01.0039.01.ENG&toc=OJ:L:2018:295:TOC https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=uriserv:OJ.L_.2018.295.01.0039.01.ENG&toc=OJ:L:2018:295:TOC  ENISA programming document 2019-2021  final | December 2018  60   Monitor the documentation, notification and communication of personal data in the context of  ENISA’s operations.   Act as ENISA’s contact point for EDPS on issues related to the processing of personal data;  cooperate and consult with EDPS whenever needed.  Information security coordination  The information security officer coordinates the information security management system on behalf of the  authorising officer. In particular, the ISO advises the ICT Unit to develop and implement information- security policies, standards, guidelines and baselines that seek to secure the confidentiality, integrity and  availability of the information systems of ENISA. The ISO is instrumental in incident handling and incident  response and security event monitoring. The ISO also leads the security training for ENISA’s staff and he  provides security guidance on all IT projects, including the evaluation and recommendation of technical  controls. In 2019 the ISO will contribute to such goals as:   Developing assurance frameworks to demonstrate ongoing improvement of the information  security management system. This includes:  o developing KPIs.   Monitoring and reporting the following to IT advisory committee:  o KPI results  o incidents identified and managed  o non-compliances with policy identified and addressed.   Improving the security posture of ENISA by planning penetration tests and vulnerability  assessments.   Advising on security policies and updating existing ones in line with the evolution of threats and  risks.   Improving the internal security training for ENISA staff.   Implementing new systems and tools that can support improvements on information security.  Objective 5.2. Engagement with stakeholders and international activities  Stakeholders communication and dissemination activities  In 2019, ENISA will continue its efforts to improve its focus on key activities and engage the higher possible  number of stakeholders. This includes the various groups of stakeholders that count with institutional,  academia, industry, the public, etc. In its engagement with the stakeholders, ENISA is guided by principles  as balanced representation, openness, transparency and inclusiveness.  Dissemination and Outreach  ENISA will continue developing various tools and channels including the website and with strong emphases  in social media. Dissemination activities are the responsibility of the Stakeholders Communication team  that will seek the appropriate level of outreach activities to take ENISA´s work to all interested and to  provide added value to Europe.  ENISA´s image of quality and trust is paramount for all stakeholders. It is indubitable the importance that  all areas of our society trust in ENISA´s work. The cybersecurity challenges are increasing in the world and  Europe is not an exception. With this objective ENISA´s image needs to be continuously reinforced. The  outreach of ENISA work is essential to create the NIS culture across the several actors in Europe. ENISA is  consistent of this fact and will work with all interested to reach the people that require information about  the work that is developed by ENISA.  ENISA programming document 2019-2021  final | December 2018  61  Several activities are planned in several Member States that will engender the cybersecurity awareness  across Europe, fulfilling ENISA´s mandate, mission and strategy until 2020.

The PSG is composed of ‘nominated members’ and members appointed ‘ad personam’. The total number  of members is 33 and they come from all over Europe. These members constitute a multidisciplinary group  deriving from industry, academia and consumer organisations and are selected upon the basis of their own  specific expertise and personal merits. Three (3) ‘nominated members’ represent national regulatory  authorities, data protection and law-enforcement authorities.  The PSG is established by the ENISA Regulation (EU) No 526/2013. The MB, acting on a proposal by the  executive director, sets up a PSG for a term of office of 2.5 years.  A new PSG was elected in 2017.The Role of the PSG group is to advise the executive director on the  development of ENISA’s work programme, and on ensuring the communication with the relevant  stakeholders on all related issues.  National liaison officer network  ENISA in 2017 has kicked off various activities aiming at strengthening the cooperation with its NLO  network. These activities were continued and were further prepared in 2018. NLOs are key actors for  ENISA programming document 2019-2021  final | December 2018  62  ENISA’s daily work and they warrant the interaction with select public sector entities in the MS while they  provide assurance in outreach, effective liaison with the MS and dissemination of ENISA deliverables.  ENISA will build upon these activities and strength its cooperation with the NLO network, as the first point  of contact for ENISA in the MS, with emphasis on:   NLO meetings to discuss possible improvements in the collaboration with ENISA and input on  selected ENISA projects. Improvements aim at leveraging on the NLO network for the  dissemination of ENISA’s work to the EU Member States and EFTA countries.   The members of the NLO network will continue to receive information on ENISA deliverables,  upcoming ENISA project related tenders, news, working groups entailing requests for identification  of experts in the MS, vacancy notices, and events organised by ENISA or where ENISA contributes  to (for example co-organiser, etc.) as well as time-critical information.   ENISA maintaining and sharing with the NLO network information on all relevant ENISA projects  and activities (e.g. unit responsible for the project, relevant tender results, etc.) while maintaining  and expanding as appropriate online resources available.  Additionally, guidelines provided by the MB on missions, objectives and functioning of the NLO network  will guide the development of this important tool for ENISA for community building.  International relations  Under the executive director’s guidance and initiative, ENISA will seek to strengthen contacts at an  international level  ENISA should participate in international cybersecurity fora such as the OECD, ICANN, IGF in so far as these  groups are discussing items related to our work programme or strategy.   Acting within its mandate, ENISA will develop contacts with important cybersecurity bodies  outside the EU where synergies are beneficial to the EU cybersecurity programme. An example is  NIST, which plays an important role in the implementation of the US Executive Order.   Starting 2018 ENISA will follow standards development and certification initiatives at the  international level, as some of the issues to be solved in the EU have international scope (notably  common criteria certification).   ENISA will follow the development of relevant subjects at the international level in order to align  EU activities with other global players. An example here is provided by the work that ITU is doing  with CSIRTs, which needs to be aligned and will create added value and harmonisation to all.   ENISA staff will attend international conferences on an ‘as needed’ basis. For instance, the  Meridian Conference is the main CIIP conference of the year and the FIRST conference plays the  same role for CERTs.   The ED should attend international conferences in order to enhance ENISA visibility.  ENISA programming document 2019-2021  final | December 2018  63  List of outputs: work programme 2019  As explained in the introduction, this document covers two scenarios, depending on the adoption and  publication of the cybersecurity act. To allow smooth transition to the new activities, this work programme  covers both scenarios and activities are labelled accordingly.  Activities labelled as Scenario 1 are using the resources available in MFF 2014-2020 COM(2013)519, and  are to be delivered independent of the adoption process of the cybersecurity act.  Activities labelled as Scenario 2 are only proposed to be delivered if the draft cybersecurity act is adopted  and published and the resources proposed in the draft general budget of the European Union for the  financial year 2019 (47) are becoming available.

Overview of the past and current situation.  WP 2019 is following the COM guidelines and MB decisions. The work programme is structured following  the objectives and the priorities of ENISA as described in the ENISA strategy.  ENISA’s budget: the variations between the years 2017 and 2018 is neutral. The budget remained with the  same amount aligned with COM communications.  In 2018 a slight increase in the title II was adopted. In 2019, the budget of Title III was optimised in order to  increase the budget in operations.  As already presented, in the preparation of work programme 2019, ENISA is considering two scenarios. In  detail, Scenario 1, uses the resources available in MFF 2014-2020 (COM(2013)519). Scenario 2, (which  assumes new regulation in place by latest mid-2019), adds new tasks and activities as proposed in the  Cybersecurity Act COM(2017)477, using resources planned in the draft general budget of the European  Union for the financial year 2019 (48).  In case of adoption of the European Commission’s proposal for ENISA’s new mandate COM(2017) 477  Final, all Titles will be increased in order to deliver the proposals of the new mandate.  The human and financial resources of past and current situation are presented in the Annexes of this  document.  Resource programming for the years 2019-2021  The distribution of budget and resources for 2019 for the activities A1 to A5 is presented in the charts at  the end of this section. The budget and resources for each activity are presented in Annex A.1.3. The  budget and posts distribution is based on the activity-based budgeting (ABB) methodology of ENISA  detailed in Annex A.1.3 of this document.  Following the publication of the NIS Directive (NISD), ENISA is re-allocating budget and resources to the  new tasks/activities provisioned for ENISA in the directive. Another area which will probably require more  budget /resources is the cybersecurity public-private partnership (cPPP). However, the impact on the  ENISA work programme has not yet been quantified. This will be updated in future versions as any other  relevant change in the ENISA scope and tasks.

Improvements in order to gain in effectiveness and efficiency  were developed. ENISA perform an internal check in relevance and optimisation of workflows, procedures  and rules, to seek optimisation and efficiency. As an example the so-called paperless, (electronic workflow  IT tool) which routes documents to staff involved in preparation, review and approval of all kinds of work- related documents and transactions represents a huge improvement and cost savings in all processes of  ENISA.  Moreover, the RD applies a strict policy on ratio between administrative support and coordination staff  and operational staff as methodology set by the European Commission and benchmarking exercise within  the institutions and EU agencies. In 2017, only 20.24 % of administrative support and coordination staff  were populating ENISA having in mind that the benchmarking of the EU Commission accept level up to  25 % of this group.  Job type 2017 2016  Total administrative support and Coordination 20.24 % 19.04 %  Administrative support 16.67 % 15.47 %  Coordination 3.57 % 3.57 %  Total operational 65.48 % 66.66 %  Top operational coordination 7.14 % 7.14 %  General operational 58.33 % 59.52 %  Total neutral 14.29 % 14.29 %  Finance and control  14.29 %  14.29 %  In addition, this version of the work programme takes account of the prioritisation exercise carried out  during the consultation with the MB. Certain activities had to be removed from the work programme as  there are not enough resources for the year 2018. Such de-prioritise activities are the following.   Activities to support a digital single market for high-quality NIS products and services.   Support the assessment of existing policies/procedures/practices on NIS within EU institutions.   Planning and organisation of EuroSOPEx 2018.  For years 2019-2021, ENISA will gradually increase the share of the activity 2, policy if more resources  become available.  The budget and resources allocations within the summary tables and Annexes in Scenario 1 are in line with  the COM(2013)519. The budget and resources allocations within the summary tables and Annexes in  Scenario 2 are in line with the proposed additional resources and budget in the draft general budget of the  European Union for the financial year 2019 (49).

ABB focuses on integrated budgeting and financial  management, based on activities linked to ENISA’s priorities and objectives.  To improve better estimation of resources needed for each ENISA activity, we need to split the budget  forecast in Direct and Indirect budget. The following assumptions are used in the simplified ABB  methodology:   Direct budget is the cost estimate of each operational activity (listed in activities A1 to A5) in  goods and services procured.   Indirect budget is the cost estimate of salaries, mission costs and overhead costs, attributable to  each operational or compliance activity. The indirect budget is redistributed against direct budget  in all activities.  ENISA programming document 2019-2021  final | December 2018  69   Compliance posts from Activity A5 Enabling are redistributed to Core activities — A1 to A4, and  operational posts of the Activity A5.   Total ABB posts (FTEs) are the sum of all the posts from all activities (A1 to A5) after the re- distribution.  The table below presents the allocation of financial and human resources to activities of ENISA based on  the above ABB methodology.   Scenario 1 is in line with the COM(2013)519.   Scenario 2 is in line with proposed additional resources and budget in the draft general budget of  the European Union for the financial year 2019 (50).

In 2017, ENISA demonstrated a commitment rate of 99.99 %, of C1 appropriation of the year at the  year end (31/12). The consumption of the 2017 budget at year end shows the capacity of the ENISA to  fully implement its annual appropriations. The same commitment rate achieved in 2010, 2011, 2012,  2013, 2014, 2015, 2016 and 2017, is maintained for an eight year in a row. The payment rate reached  88.19 % and the amount carried forward to 2018 is EUR 1 411 440.51, representing 13.30 % of total C1  appropriations 2017.   Cancellation of Payment Appropriations for the year  No payment appropriations were cancelled.   Cancellation of Payment Appropriations carried over  (Fund source ‘C8’ — appropriations carried over automatically from 2016 to 2017.)  The appropriations of 2016 carried over to 2017 were utilised at a rate of 90.61 % (automatic carry- overs) which indicates a satisfactory capability of estimation of needs. From EUR 968 198.32 carried  forward, EUR 90 916.34 was cancelled, due to the fact that the estimated expenditure deviated from  the actual paid amount. This cancellation represent 0.87 % of the total budget.

ENISA programming document 2019-2021  final | December 2018  79  Annex IV: Human resources — Qualitative  A. Recruitment policy  Statutory staff  ENISA continues to enhance the management of selection procedure with a focus on improving time to  hire, developing good practices in recruitment (e.g. Conflict of Interest assessment for candidates being  recruited in line with Articles 11 and 11a of the SR/Articles 11 and 81 of Conditions of Employment of  Other Servants of the European Union (CEOS)) and streamlining processes. The acquisition of a modern e- recruitment tool from another EU agency would definitively help.  ENISA is also investing in the development of an HR strategic approach focusing on competency-based  interview’s questions, tailor-made training for selection-board members, alignment of competencies  across the organisation per job profile, targeted recruitment procedures for specialised profiles,  transversal recruitment procedures where reserve lists could be used for filling vacant positions across all  departments/Units, specific dissemination of ENISA’s job vacancies, etc.  The job family and job category framework is being consolidated in line with the Annex I of the SR:  Assistant job family   Assistant job category (staff carrying out administrative, technical activities such as assistance  and/or secretariat requiring a certain degree of autonomy): typically, these posts are filled by grades  SC 1-SC 2, AST 1-AST 3, FG I, FG II.   Technical Assistant Job Category (staff providing support with a medium degree of autonomy in the  drafting of documents and assistance in the implementation of policies/projects/  procedures/processes): typically, these posts are filled by grades AST 4-AST 7, FG III.   Senior assistant job category (staff carrying out administrative, technical activities requiring high  degree of autonomy and carrying out significant responsibilities in staff management, budget  implementation or coordination): typically, these posts are filled by grades AST 7-AST 11 and only  for the two Assistants to Head of departments by FG IV.  Operational job family   Junior officer/administrator job category (staff providing junior expertise in a specific field of  knowledge): typically, these posts are filled by grades AD 5, FG IV 13.   Officer/administrator job category (staff providing officer expertise in a specific field of knowledge):  typically, these posts are filled by grades AD 6-AD 7, FG IV 14-18.   Lead officer/administrator (staff providing top level expertise in a specific field of knowledge):  typically, these posts are filled by grades AD 8-AD 9.   Team leader job category (staff providing operational excellence with some managerial  responsibilities): typically, these posts are filed by grades AD 7-AD 10, FG IV 14-18.  Managerial job family   Middle manager job category (staff providing operational vision and managerial expertise including  financial management): typically, these posts are Head of Unit positions filled by grades AD 9-AD 12.   Senior manager job category (staff providing strategical vision and managerial expertise including  financial expertise): typically, these posts are Head of Department position (filled by grades AD 11- AD 13).  ENISA programming document 2019-2021  final | December 2018  80   Executive director (filled by grades AD 14-15).  Following the 2014 SR reform, ENISA adopted and is applying the new implementing rules on the  engagement and use of temporary staff for agencies (TA 2f), thus ensuring a more consistent staff policy and  allowing inter-mobility between EU agencies.  On the duration of employment, temporary agents (TAs) and contract agents (CAs) are offered typically long- term contract of three years, renewable for another limited period of five years. These contracts are  converted into contracts of indefinite period if a second renewal is offered and accepted. All contracts  renewals are subject to an assessment of the performance of the staff member and depend on budget  availability and the business needs for the function occupied as stipulated in the ED Decision 38/2017 of  6 June 2017 on employment contract renewal. In addition, ENISA is activating short-term contract agents  (2 years, renewable once for a maximum one year) to be allocated depending on business needs or any  other human resources constraints (i.e. long-term sick leave or part-time, etc.) This engagement of staff  allows ENISA to keep an adequate degree of flexibility and adapt the workforce based in the business needs.  Non-statutory staff  ENISA welcomes SNEs as an opportunity to foster the exchange of experience and knowledge of ENISA  working methods and to widen the expertise network. Experts can be seconded to ENISA for the duration of  a minimum six months to a maximum of four years. ENISA offers paid traineeship opportunities to talented,  highly qualified young professionals at the start of their careers, in a field of their choice. Trainees have the  opportunity to immerse themselves in ENISA’s work and in the European system in general. The traineeship  may last from a minimum of six months to a maximum of 12 months.  Finally, in compliance with both the EU legal framework and the Greek labour legislation, ENISA’s policy is  intended to rely on interim services under specific circumstances and for limited period. ENISA holds a  framework contract that has been awarded to a temping agency.  B. Appraisal of performance and reclassification/promotions  ENISA has adopted the implementing rules: MB 2016/10 on Reclassification of CAs, MB 2016/11 on  Reclassification of TA’s.  For the forthcoming years, the organisation will strive to see performance management as a business  process that improves employee engagement and drive business results. It will enable staff to focus on  having a constructive dialogue with the manager and to consider the exercise as a valuable developmental  tool, while clarifying that the appraisal and the promotion are two different exercises.

Mobility policy  All internal moves are processed via Article 7 of the Staff Regulations and for transparency purposes are  published internally on INTRAENISA. In order to create a motivated and versatile workforce, ENISA has  adopted an ED policy 01/2017 of 22 February 2017 on internal mobility policy. ENISA also joined the inter- agency job market (IAJM) with the view, as for all other agencies, to offer possibilities of mobility to staff in  agencies by assuring a continuation of careers and grades. In 2016, 1 staff member moved via the IAJM.  Additionally, ENISA is also opened to mobility between the agencies and the EU institutions. In 2016, no  mobility was organised while in 2017, one mobility was organised.  D. Learning and development  ENISA is striving for excellence in the approach to developing staff. In order to make the most out of its  internal expertise and to develop mechanisms to retain staff, the organisation is focusing on offering a wide  range of Learning and Development Opportunities including mandatory training (e.g. Ethics and Integrity,  harassment prevention, etc.), various workshops and team building events, online courses, access to EU- Learn, etc.  E. Gender and geographical balance  As of 31/12/2017 ENISA counts with 74 staff members (42 TAs from which 29 ADs and 13 ASTs), 29 CAs and  3 SNEs.  The overall gender balance among ENISA staff shows a male prevalence that is understandable given the  scope of ENISA’s work. As a measure to promote equal opportunities, the terms of published vacancy notices  prevent any kind of discrimination and the selection board composition is balanced in term of gender and  nationality as far as possible. In line with the European Commission’s objective to achieve 40 % female  representation in managerial positions, ENISA nominated in 2016 and 2017 a French woman as head of HR  and a Swedish woman as head of finances and procurement.  For geographical balance, while there is no quota system in operation, the staff regulations require when  recruiting to strive for a broad balance among nationalities and to adopt measures if there is imbalance  between nationalities among staff. ENISA is paying great attention to this requirement as reflected by the  latest recruitments. The overall gender balance per grade and per operational unit can be find below:  64,29%  41,67%  48,15%  60,38%  44%  42,86%  100%  50%  78%  54,12%  35,71%  58,33%  51,85%  39,62%  56%  57,14%  50%  22%  45,88%  A D  A S T  C A  C O D  R D  E D  C O D  M A N A G E M E N T  R D  M A N A G E M E N T  M A N A G E M E N T  ( T O T A L )  E N I S A  ( T O T A L )  GENDER BALANCE Male Female  ENISA programming document 2019-2021  final | December 2018  83  F. Schooling  A European School is located in Heraklion and is used by staff members of ENISA. For school year 2017-2018  2 pupils attended primary and three pupils attended secondary school.  The rest of ENISA pupils attend various schools in Athens based on service level agreement concluded with  a number of international schools. For the school year 2017-2018, 20 pupils attended nursery and  kindergarten and 19 pupils attended primary and secondary school. ENISA considers schooling as an  essential part of its staff policy and thus, contribute to the expenses of school care for the children.  Annex V: Buildings  ENISA is currently negotiating a reduction in space rented in Heraklion and an increase in the space rented  in Athens. It is expected that the relevant contracts will be negotiated and concluded in order to  accommodate all ENISA staff in a suitable work environment.  ENISA programming document 2019-2021  final | December 2018  84  Annex VI: Privileges and immunities  Agency privileges  Privileges granted to staff  Protocol of privileges and immunities/diplomatic status Education/day care  Under Article 23 of Regulation (EU)  No 526/2013 of the European Parliament  and of the Council of 21 May 2013, the  protocol No 7 on the privileges and  immunities of the European Union  annexed to the Treaty on European  Union (TEU) and the Treaty on the  Functioning of the European  Union  (TFEU) applies to ENISA and its  staff.  Under Article 23 of Regulation (EU) No 526/2013 of the  European Parliament and of the Council of 21 May 2013,  the protocol No 7 on the privileges and immunities of  the European Union annexed to the TEU and the TFEU  applies to ENISA and its staff.  The Greek Government and ENISA signed a Seat  Agreement in April 2005, which was ratified by Greek  Law 3572/2007 and is applicable to ENISA and its staff.  A public School of European Education,  Type 2, was founded in 2005 by the  Greek government in Heraklion —  Crete for the children of the staff of  ENISA.  There is no European School operating  in Athens.  Annex VII: Evaluations  Internal monitoring system Matrix has been put in place at ENISA and is used for project management by  ENISA staff. Regular progress reports are presented at the meetings of the ENISA management team and  reviewed at the midterm review meetings.  Also, external consultant has been contracted to carry annual ex post evaluation of core operational  activities. The scope of the evaluation focuses on ENISA’s core operational activities, with an estimated  expenditure above EUR 30 000. The overall objective of the annual evaluations is to evaluate the  effectiveness, efficiency, added value, utility, coordination and consistency.  Annex VIII: Risks 2019  The risk assessment was performed by the IAS in 2016. Three areas were proposed for the next 3 years:  Stakeholders’ Involvement in the Production of Deliverables in ENISA (done in 2017), Human Resources  (2018), Information and Communication Technology (2019).

The purpose of key indicators for ENISA is to provide the metrics to measure against performance, results  and impact of ENISA’s outcome, output and impact. Key indicators seek to better support policy dynamics  on NIS, an area of policy that largely still remains under development at the EU level, as technology and  business models evolve.  The chosen approach initially sets the designated levels of key indicators; each type of indicator is grouped  alongside other similar ones at the appropriate level. This approach has been developed taking into  account the capability of ENISA to report, and the need to avoid any unnecessary burden on ENISA. ENISA  capability to report reflects, effort, organisational measures as well as tools available or that can be  obtained relatively easily. Measuring operational performance that concerns the policy raison d’être of  ENISA remains the focal point for the key indicators introduced. The key notions and main vectors of  annual and multiannual measurements are presented below.  Key indicators at ENISA seek to measure:   Performance that is a concern at the output level when deliverables are produced. Metrics used,  are project management-based and they include the following.  a. Adherence to the scope of the deliverable or project.  b. Budget (or financial resources) available to the output or project, remaining within prescribed  levels with a ± 5 % margin.  c. People (or human resources) available to the output or project, remaining within prescribed levels  with a ± 5 % margin.  d. Time available to carry out the output or project remaining within prescribed levels with a ± 5 %  margin.  e. Quality of performance depending on the type of output, according to the classification of output  in the work programme (being, publication, event, support).  ENISA programming document 2019-2021  final | December 2018  88   Results that are a concern at the annual and at multiannual activities’ level. The indicators used are  as follows.  a. Delivery indicator aiming at delivery of at least 95 % against work programme planning. This is  equivalent to a 3σ (3 Sigma) organisation (reaching between 93.3 % and 99.3 %); clearly ENISA has  historically proven its operational ability to deliver at much higher level, meeting 6σ (6 Sigma)  specification requirements (at 99.99 %). However allowing for a 3 Sigma level meets the  abovementioned deviation rate of ±5 % (51). The criteria used, being scope, budget, people, time  and quality, they all refer to the proper execution of the project leading up to the production of  output. This evaluation is done at the end of the project within ENISA.  b. Following the production process that leads up to an output, feedback from stakeholders is  collected on each output. Results are further aggregated on a multiannual basis by ENISA.   Impact is measured at ENISA level only; it is based on feedback received from the evaluation of  ENISA’s performance (own initiatives and commissioned consulting at ENISA’s initiative) and/or  institutional third party evaluations such as those commissioned by the European Commission, the  European Court of Auditors etc.  The key indicators broken down at the output level, the activities level and ENISA level, are presented  below.  Key indicators in ENISA  Output level Activities level Agency level  Scope (e.g. Scope drift as  compared to approved WP  plan)  S Variable:  TLR  Deliverables (number of  deliverables completed against  the WP plan)  D Numerical:  quantitative  target  Evaluation (results’  aggregates) Periodic agency  evaluation e.g. COM(2018),  Ramboll etc.)  E Variable:  TLR  Budget (e.g. appropriations  utilised and staff engaged  in a project plus or minus  5 %)  B Variable:  TLR  Feedback (number of positive  and not so positive feedback)  (*)  F Numerical:  quantitative  target  People (e.g. staff engaged  in a project plus or minus  5 %)  P Variable:  TLR  Feedback aggregates for  multiannual performance (**)  Fa Numerical:  quantitative  target  Time (e.g. duration of  project plus or minus 5 %)  T Variable:  TLR  (*) Feedback via e.g. survey  associated with deliverables on  website  Quality (e.g. citations,  downloads, MS  participation etc.)  Q Integer:  quantitative  target  (**) Aggregations of  deliverables or categories  thereof  All rating indicators follow a variable traffic-light rating (TLR) system that is laid out as follows:   Green, that reflects 5 % deviation meaning that the planning/performance are appropriate and  within prescribed levels.   Yellow, that reflects 20 % deviation meaning that the planning/performance need to be revisited.   Red, which reflects deviation above 20 % meaning that the planning/performance need thorough  review.  (51) In a normal distribution σ (or sigma) denotes the distance between the mean value and the inflection point. Shortening this distance is an indicator of  enhanced quality of performance. While a Six Sigma (or, 6σ) methodology is beyond the scope of the current version of the ENISA QMS,  portions of it  are used in select areas, such as key indicators. In ENISA, the reference standard operating procedure (SOP) here is the SOP PDCA that is a simplified  version of the define-measure-analyse-improve-control (DMAIC) approach typically associated with Six Sigma. The choice for simplicity is obviously  desirable while the implementation of a quality system is an ongoing concern. Six Sigma focuses on process control for reducing or eliminating waste. Six  Sigma utilises historical data along with statistical analysis to measure and improve a company’s operational performance e.g. processes, practices and  support systems. Six Sigma is a measure of process quality the variation of which is measured in six standard deviations from the mean.  ENISA programming document 2019-2021  final | December 2018  89  Feedback is collected by means of surveys. It is envisaged that the deliverables part of the website will be  leveraged to channel targeted feedback against each deliverable downloaded. This is a task however that  will be made available as from 2018, at the earliest.  Below follows an example of output related indicators to be collected on the key types of agency output,  being publication, Event, Support types of output.  #  KPI Description Output type (P) (*) Output type (E) (**) Output type (S) (***)  1 S Defined in the planning phase and  confirmed throughout delivery  Scope in start remains identical to scope in the end  2 B Budget remains within ± 5 % of  designated budget level to cover the  established requirements  Working group, external  supplier, experts etc.  Logistics, reimbursements for  speakers, catering,  communication etc.  Technical equipment, services,  communication, market research  etc.  3 P Staff allocated to remain within ±5 %  of designated FTEs  REF: Matrix data  4 T Project duration to remain within  ±5 % of planned time  REF: Matrix data  5 Q Any of the following quality indicators  as appropriate  Number of MS involved,  experts from MS authorities,  Industry representatives,  R & D etc., % population  (survey) etc.  Number of participants,  aggregation of feedback in  event survey etc.  Number of subscribers,  aggregation of feedback of  participants; feedback of the  policy principal (e.g. COM /MS  etc.)  (*) Publication e.g. methods for security and privacy cost analysis  (**) Event e.g. workshop on privacy and security  (***) Support e.g. NIS portal  Below follows an example of outcome related indicators to be collected on the key types of agency  activities, at the annual and at the multiannual level.

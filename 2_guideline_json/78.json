NIST is responsible for developing information security standards and guidelines, including 56  minimum requirements for federal information systems, but such standards and guidelines shall not apply 57  to national security systems without the express approval of appropriate federal officials exercising policy 58  authority over such systems. This guideline is consistent with the requirements of the Office of Management 59  and Budget (OMB) Circular A-130. 60  Nothing in this publication should be taken to contradict the standards and guidelines made mandatory and 61  binding on federal agencies by the Secretary of Commerce under statutory authority.

ITL develops tests, test 94  methods, reference data, proof of concept implementations, and technical analyses to advance the 95  development and productive use of information technology. ITL’s responsibilities include the 96  development of management, administrative, technical, and physical standards and guidelines for 97  the cost-effective security and privacy of other than national security-related information in federal 98  information systems. The Special Publication 800-series reports on ITL’s research, guidelines, and 99  outreach efforts in information system security, and its collaborative activities with industry, 100  government, and academic organizations. 101  Abstract 102  NIST Special Publication (SP) 800-140F replaces the approved non-invasive attack mitigation 103  test metric requirements of ISO/IEC 19790 Annex F.

It is also beyond doubt that in order to effectively and  efficientlyrespond to threats and attacks against information infrastructure a coordinated approach  at European level is needed. One way to facilitate that goal is to support the Member States in  enhancing cooperation among national / governmental CERTs, with regards to information sharing  and coordinated incident response.  Due to still existing diversity in capabilities a Europe-wide operational cooperation among national /  governmental CERTs, involving stakeholders in all Member States, does not yet exist. However, there  are activities and initiatives for information sharing and incident response, which work quite well in  practice, and some of them are already active for years.  The experiences gained from these activities provide very valuable insight into cross-border  cooperation and the requirements and the obstacles for sustainable information sharing. All future  actions at European level to foster cooperation among national / governmental CERTs must take into  account experiences made within these successful activities.  Status of this document  The document in its current status is in no way to be considered final, but rather as the record of an  ongoing process. This process was started by ENISA in 2009 with a stock-taking survey among all  known CERT teams in Europe  (in excess of 120 in total) and was, together with the EU Member States  and their national / governmental CERTs continued in 2010. This document is therefore to be  considered work-in-progress that will undergo necessary changes in the future in accordance with an  ongoing dialogue with all relevant stakeholders, which is reflecting the ongoing changes taking place  in the European NIS landscape. In some areas of the capabilities of national / governmental CERTs the  proposed requirements are quite stable, while in other areas additional research, analysis and  comprehensive discussions with the stakeholders involved are necessary. Having a national /  governmental CERTs in place that fulfils the requirements for ’baseline capabilities’ as defined in this  document is essential for CIIP in all Member States. However these teams should not be considered  as the one and only necessary measure a Member State must take in order to ensure adequate  protection. CIIP at the national level must always be planned as part of a complete cyber-security  strategy, in which a national / governmental CERT plays an important role but is not the only  component. The planning of a complete national cyber-security strategy in a Member State is outside  the scope of this document.

National / governmental CERTs play a key role in coordinating incident  management with the relevant stakeholders at national level. In addition they bear responsibility for  cooperation with the national / governmental teams in other countries.  Target audience  The primary target audience for the updated overview about ‘baseline capabilities’ in this document  are the national/governmental CERTs and those policy-making bodies in the European Union Member  States that are responsible for initiating and planning the establishment and operation of a national /  governmental CERT and are responsible for creating an adequate national policy framework for these  tasks.  National/governmental CERTs  ENISA’s recommendations on baseline capabilities  Update, December 2014  Page  2  2 ENISA’s update of national / governmental CERT baseline capabilities  2.1 National / governmental CERTs in Europe  The main goal of a national / governmental CERT, from a cyber-security perspective, is to protect  national and economic security, the ongoing operations of a government, and the ability of critical  infrastructures to continue to function. Therefore a national / governmental CERT typically handles  incidents at a national level, identifies incidents that could affect critical infrastructures, warns critical  stakeholders about computer security threats, and helps to build effective incident response across  its constituency in both, public and private sectors.  In 2005, ENISA has made its first mapping of existing CERT teams in Europe. In total, there was no  more than 100 teams which represented different types of constituencies (e.g. academic, national,  private sector). Ten years ago only ten known national/governmental CERTs were established and  operational in Europe. Following years the number of teams has grown gradually, but not evenly to a  specific region or a country.  Since its establishment in 2005, ENISA has actively supported the process for setting up and  developing of new teams in Europe. Strong emphasis has been put on capacity building in the areas  of effective collaboration, information sharing and cross-border incident response. It has been  identified that  effective cross-border incident response and information exchange needs an agreed  and common minimum level of capabilities to be accomplished by every participating team.  In 2009, ENISA published a first report on a set of baseline recommendations regarding the minimum  capabilities for national / governmental CERT. This document was the foundation for all further  activities of ENISA in the area of CERTs like capacity building and trainings, or collaboration between  CERTs and law enforcement agencies.  The importance of having a national / governmental CERT in every EU Member State established and  operational has been also reflected at the EU policy level recently (e.g. the Digital Agenda, the EU  Cyber Security Strategy and in the proposal for a NIS Directive).  The basic service that all CERTs needs to provide is Incident Response, so every team needs to be able  to react or respond to security incidents when they happen.  Incident Reporting is a different type of a service that a national/governmental team can offer, which  Is of growing importance, as many teams act as national point of contact for incident response  coordination (and thus as information hub for teams in other countries, or for stakeholders in its own  country). Reporting of incidents also feeds into the various activities for creation of incident statistics,  or mandatory reporting according to regulation.  The work of CERTs is delicate and in order to be successful in its daily operations a high level of trust  needs to be established with a team’s constituents, other teams and non-CERT partners and  stakeholders, so it is of utmost importance to have this agreed basic level of functionality and  capability.  2.2 Improving national / governmental CERT capabilities – ENISA guidance  The four main categories of capabilities that ENISA defined in 2009 remain unchanged, however, in  order to make these categories better understandable also for non-CERT stakeholders like policy  makers, we introduce new names in this document.  National/governmental CERTs  ENISA’s recommendations on baseline capabilities  Update, December 2014  Page  3  2.2.1 Formal capability (former ‘Mandate and Strategy’)  Today policymakers have a better understanding of the importance of and challenges in protecting  not only government information but also critical infrastructures that support their economies and  the broader public interest within their borders. They are seeking effective and coordinated  approaches in their responses to cyber-incidents, threats and attacks that can affect both the public  and private sectors. The maturity of national Cybersecurity- and CIIP strategies and the roles of  national / governmental CERTs in these strategies are not harmonized between countries and depend  strongly on the specific context defined in a country. What is indisputable, however, is that national /  governmental CERTs have a key role to play in those strategies from multiple perspectives like  information sharing and the coordination of responses to incidents, reporting, etc.  A number of key actions that need to be taken, in order to fulfil this capability:1   An official mandate given by the national government that the team has the capability and  the role to officially act and react to cyber security incidents or threats   A clear definition of roles and responsibilities2 of the team under the national cyber security  policy and legal framework   Clearly defined relationships with other national stakeholders concerning national cyber  security landscape and incident response practice (e.g. LEA, military, ISPs, NSA)   Stability of the mandate and duration to assure a growing maturity and effectiveness of the  team   Continuity of resources regardless of changes on the national political landscape to assure  the continuous incident response capability in the country   With regard to trust building a clearly defined and broadly communicated role of the team in  relation to the host organisation, if any (e.g. Ministry of defence, NSA or top level domain  provider) to external parties  Recommended sources for further improvement of the formal capability through EU documentation  and ENISA’s online good practice library:   Digital Agenda for Europe (European Commission, “COM(2010)245 at http://eur- lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:52010DC0245R(01)&from=EN   Cybersecurity Strategy of the European Union: An Open, Safe and Secure Cyberspace -  JOIN(2013) at  http://ec.europa.eu/information_society/newsroom/cf/dae/document.cfm?doc_id=1667   Cyber security strategies in EU MSs – ENISA’s overview at  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/national-cyber-security- strategies-ncsss/national-cyber-security-strategies-in-the-world   Incident reporting and cyber security regulation at  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/Incidents-reporting   Directive on attacks against information systems – ENISA recommendations for CERTs at  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/support/fight-against-cybercrime/the-directive- on-attacks-against-information-systems   European CERT community membership at http://www.terena.org/activities/tf-csirt/   Global CERT community membership at http://www.first.org/members  1 For more recommendations and details on ‘Formal capability’ consult  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/support/baseline-capabilities  2 See RFC2350 for further details about roles and responsibilities  http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:52010DC0245R(01)&from=EN http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:52010DC0245R(01)&from=EN http://ec.europa.eu/information_society/newsroom/cf/dae/document.cfm?doc_id=1667 http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/national-cyber-security-strategies-ncsss/national-cyber-security-strategies-in-the-world http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/national-cyber-security-strategies-ncsss/national-cyber-security-strategies-in-the-world http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/Incidents-reporting http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/support/fight-against-cybercrime/the-directive-on-attacks-against-information-systems http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/support/fight-against-cybercrime/the-directive-on-attacks-against-information-systems http://www.terena.org/activities/tf-csirt/ http://www.first.org/members http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/support/baseline-capabilities  National/governmental CERTs  ENISA’s recommendations on baseline capabilities  Update, December 2014  Page  4  2.2.2 Operational-technical capability (former ‘Service Portfolio’)  The service portfolio of any national / governmental CERT will consist of the external services it  provides to its constituency and its internal support processes. External CERT services are commonly  categorized into three service classes: Proactive, reactive and other security management services.  Reactive services: these services are triggered by an event or request, such as a report of a  compromised host, widespread malicious code, software vulnerability, or something that was  identified by an intrusion detection or logging system. Reactive services are the core component of  CERT work.  Proactive services: these services provide assistance and information to help prepare, protect, and  secure constituent systems in anticipation of attacks, problems, or events. Performance of these  services will directly reduce the number of incidents in the future.  The core baseline services for the constituency remain the same as defined in the first report of 2009  3 (incident response, alerts and warnings and announcements). Additional services could be provided  to the constituency or to the cooperation partners, like artifact analysis, technology watch or more  sophisticated digital forensics analysis for law enforcement agencies in order to support the fight  against cyber crime; however, these are optional and do not count to the baseline.  It should be noted that external services still require appropriate internal support processes such as,  for example, resource or infrastructure management processes. These supporting processes should  also receive adequate consideration as they are the keys to the continuous improvement of the  maturity of a national / governmental CERT.  Internal services might be for example a good situational awareness, technical cyber security trainings  for staff or participation in various cyber security exercises (e.g. Cyber Europe Exercise).  Emerging new service or customised alerts and warnings?  Cyber threat intelligence is nowadays a popular proactive type of service that a team can offer to its  constituency.  The advantage of this service for the team is to be able to issue probability-based warnings of future  cyber attacks and tailore alerts and warnings to the specific risks and threats of the constituency.  Cyber Threat Intelligence is an ‘evidence-based knowledge including context, mechanisms, indicators,  implications and actionable advice about an existing or emerging threat or risk to assets that can be  used to inform decisions regarding the subject’s response to that threat or risk’4.  Based on the provided definition this service should be considered as a subset of  Alerts and Warnings  if provided.

Without operational resources such as staff and infrastructure, a national  / governmental CERT cannot offer the services discussed in the previous chapter. These requirements  has been described in depth in the 2009 report6. The essential aspects of operational-orgnaisational  capability remain the same: resources, infrastructure, service delivery and business continuity.  Resourcing such as minimum staffing for delivering its services and the budget allocation for the  equipment, staff, education also including budget for necessary trust building activities like meetings,  workshops and conferences are indispensable elements of well functioning team and trust building  for an effective incident response coordination.  6  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/support/files/baseline-capabilities-for-national-governmental- certs  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/support/chiht https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/support/incident-management/files/good-practice-guide-for-incident-management https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/support/incident-management/files/good-practice-guide-for-incident-management https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/support/incident-handling-automation https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/support/proactive-detection https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/support/awa https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/support/ActionableInformationforSecurityIncidentResponse.pdf https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/support/ActionableInformationforSecurityIncidentResponse.pdf http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/support/files/baseline-capabilities-for-national-governmental-certs http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/support/files/baseline-capabilities-for-national-governmental-certs  National/governmental CERTs  ENISA’s recommendations on baseline capabilities  Update, December 2014  Page  6  As a national / governmental CERT is both working for the protection of critical infrastructure of a  government and usually acts as a CERT-of-last-resort for all incidents in its constituency, it should be  considered mandatory for the CERT to be reachable 24/7/365 by its constituents and its national and  international partners.  The requirements concerning confidentiality, integrity and availability of the infrastructure for  national / governmental CERTs also remain very stringent because of the role national / governmental  CERTs play in crisis situations (eg, large-scale cyber-attacks),  the confidentiality of the information  processed and stored by a national / governmental CERT (records of incidents, CII vulnerabilities, etc)  and because of the criticality of the infrastructure that a national / governmental CERT helps to protect  (energy, healthcare, communication networks, etc).  Recommended sources for further improvement of Operational-organisational capability through  ENISA’s online best practice library and other sources:   RFC2350 at http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc2350.html   How to measure cost effectiveness for CERT at  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/other-work/introduction-to-return-on-security- investment   Overview about the existing EU MS national / governmental CERTs  in Annex A   Recommended check list for publicly available information about the team in Annex B  2.2.4 Co-operational capability (former ‘Cooperation’)  The security and resilience of national cyber-infrastructure is the joint responsibility of all  stakeholders, including operators, service providers, hardware and software providers, end-users,  public bodies and national governments. These organisations each have their own roles to play in  implementing and operating the national cyber-security, and in order to be effective they must  cooperate closely. If national / governmental CERTs are to meet their objectives, sustained and  effective cooperation at both the national and international levels is indispensible. Threats,  vulnerabilities and subsequent incidents in cyberspace often affect more than one sector or country.  Different situations still require different models of cooperation. A national / governmental CERT can  use different procedures to cooperate with a domestic law enforcement organisation or telecom  operator than it uses to cooperate with another national / governmental CERT on the other side of  the globe. The most important cooperation models remain to be the bi/multi-lateral cooperation and  an association or community.  In Europe, a number of national / governmental CERTs have already established relationships with  other national / governmental CERTs7 and with national and international CERT associations8 and have  reached a significant level of maturity, producing high quality responses and information. They have  also made bilateral agreements within certain groups on the use of common procedures, terminology,  frameworks, standards, etc. Yet a large gap still remains; certain national / governmental CERTs  currently lack the maturity or resources to reach these levels of cooperation. In the field, this gap  translates into a number of difficulties in incident handling cooperation.

Expertise skillset of the team members is an important asset for the daily operation of a team  especially considering its core services delivery. In order to reach and maintain the expected high level  of knowledge and skills in the area of fast evolving cyber security issues a continuous training and  education has to be enabled to the team members.  The problem of trust building goes beyond the world of CERTs and can be applied to any community  made either of individuals or teams that need to collaborate occasionally. Therefore strong emphasis  need to be given to develop this behaviourour type of skills and not only internally within the team,  but also with its constituency and the cooperation partners.

The suggested range of  stakeholders is as wide as the topics and goal to achieve.

It is also beyond doubt that in order to effectively and  efficientlyrespond to threats and attacks against information infrastructure a coordinated approach  at European level is needed. One way to facilitate that goal is to support the Member States in  enhancing cooperation among national / governmental CERTs, with regards to information sharing  and coordinated incident response.  Due to still existing diversity in capabilities a Europe-wide operational cooperation among national /  governmental CERTs, involving stakeholders in all Member States, does not yet exist. However, there  are activities and initiatives for information sharing and incident response, which work quite well in  practice, and some of them are already active for years.  The experiences gained from these activities provide very valuable insight into cross-border  cooperation and the requirements and the obstacles for sustainable information sharing. All future  actions at European level to foster cooperation among national / governmental CERTs must take into  account experiences made within these successful activities.  Status of this document  The document in its current status is in no way to be considered final, but rather as the record of an  ongoing process. This process was started by ENISA in 2009 with a stock-taking survey among all  known CERT teams in Europe  (in excess of 120 in total) and was, together with the EU Member States  and their national / governmental CERTs continued in 2010. This document is therefore to be  considered work-in-progress that will undergo necessary changes in the future in accordance with an  ongoing dialogue with all relevant stakeholders, which is reflecting the ongoing changes taking place  in the European NIS landscape. In some areas of the capabilities of national / governmental CERTs the  proposed requirements are quite stable, while in other areas additional research, analysis and  comprehensive discussions with the stakeholders involved are necessary. Having a national /  governmental CERTs in place that fulfils the requirements for ’baseline capabilities’ as defined in this  document is essential for CIIP in all Member States. However these teams should not be considered  as the one and only necessary measure a Member State must take in order to ensure adequate  protection. CIIP at the national level must always be planned as part of a complete cyber-security  strategy, in which a national / governmental CERT plays an important role but is not the only  component. The planning of a complete national cyber-security strategy in a Member State is outside  the scope of this document.

National / governmental CERTs play a key role in coordinating incident  management with the relevant stakeholders at national level. In addition they bear responsibility for  cooperation with the national / governmental teams in other countries.  Target audience  The primary target audience for the updated overview about ‘baseline capabilities’ in this document  are the national/governmental CERTs and those policy-making bodies in the European Union Member  States that are responsible for initiating and planning the establishment and operation of a national /  governmental CERT and are responsible for creating an adequate national policy framework for these  tasks.  National/governmental CERTs  ENISA’s recommendations on baseline capabilities  Update, December 2014  Page  2  2 ENISA’s update of national / governmental CERT baseline capabilities  2.1 National / governmental CERTs in Europe  The main goal of a national / governmental CERT, from a cyber-security perspective, is to protect  national and economic security, the ongoing operations of a government, and the ability of critical  infrastructures to continue to function. Therefore a national / governmental CERT typically handles  incidents at a national level, identifies incidents that could affect critical infrastructures, warns critical  stakeholders about computer security threats, and helps to build effective incident response across  its constituency in both, public and private sectors.  In 2005, ENISA has made its first mapping of existing CERT teams in Europe. In total, there was no  more than 100 teams which represented different types of constituencies (e.g. academic, national,  private sector). Ten years ago only ten known national/governmental CERTs were established and  operational in Europe. Following years the number of teams has grown gradually, but not evenly to a  specific region or a country.  Since its establishment in 2005, ENISA has actively supported the process for setting up and  developing of new teams in Europe. Strong emphasis has been put on capacity building in the areas  of effective collaboration, information sharing and cross-border incident response. It has been  identified that  effective cross-border incident response and information exchange needs an agreed  and common minimum level of capabilities to be accomplished by every participating team.  In 2009, ENISA published a first report on a set of baseline recommendations regarding the minimum  capabilities for national / governmental CERT. This document was the foundation for all further  activities of ENISA in the area of CERTs like capacity building and trainings, or collaboration between  CERTs and law enforcement agencies.  The importance of having a national / governmental CERT in every EU Member State established and  operational has been also reflected at the EU policy level recently (e.g. the Digital Agenda, the EU  Cyber Security Strategy and in the proposal for a NIS Directive).  The basic service that all CERTs needs to provide is Incident Response, so every team needs to be able  to react or respond to security incidents when they happen.  Incident Reporting is a different type of a service that a national/governmental team can offer, which  Is of growing importance, as many teams act as national point of contact for incident response  coordination (and thus as information hub for teams in other countries, or for stakeholders in its own  country). Reporting of incidents also feeds into the various activities for creation of incident statistics,  or mandatory reporting according to regulation.  The work of CERTs is delicate and in order to be successful in its daily operations a high level of trust  needs to be established with a team’s constituents, other teams and non-CERT partners and  stakeholders, so it is of utmost importance to have this agreed basic level of functionality and  capability.  2.2 Improving national / governmental CERT capabilities – ENISA guidance  The four main categories of capabilities that ENISA defined in 2009 remain unchanged, however, in  order to make these categories better understandable also for non-CERT stakeholders like policy  makers, we introduce new names in this document.  National/governmental CERTs  ENISA’s recommendations on baseline capabilities  Update, December 2014  Page  3  2.2.1 Formal capability (former ‘Mandate and Strategy’)  Today policymakers have a better understanding of the importance of and challenges in protecting  not only government information but also critical infrastructures that support their economies and  the broader public interest within their borders. They are seeking effective and coordinated  approaches in their responses to cyber-incidents, threats and attacks that can affect both the public  and private sectors. The maturity of national Cybersecurity- and CIIP strategies and the roles of  national / governmental CERTs in these strategies are not harmonized between countries and depend  strongly on the specific context defined in a country. What is indisputable, however, is that national /  governmental CERTs have a key role to play in those strategies from multiple perspectives like  information sharing and the coordination of responses to incidents, reporting, etc.  A number of key actions that need to be taken, in order to fulfil this capability:1   An official mandate given by the national government that the team has the capability and  the role to officially act and react to cyber security incidents or threats   A clear definition of roles and responsibilities2 of the team under the national cyber security  policy and legal framework   Clearly defined relationships with other national stakeholders concerning national cyber  security landscape and incident response practice (e.g. LEA, military, ISPs, NSA)   Stability of the mandate and duration to assure a growing maturity and effectiveness of the  team   Continuity of resources regardless of changes on the national political landscape to assure  the continuous incident response capability in the country   With regard to trust building a clearly defined and broadly communicated role of the team in  relation to the host organisation, if any (e.g. Ministry of defence, NSA or top level domain  provider) to external parties  Recommended sources for further improvement of the formal capability through EU documentation  and ENISA’s online good practice library:   Digital Agenda for Europe (European Commission, “COM(2010)245 at http://eur- lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:52010DC0245R(01)&from=EN   Cybersecurity Strategy of the European Union: An Open, Safe and Secure Cyberspace -  JOIN(2013) at  http://ec.europa.eu/information_society/newsroom/cf/dae/document.cfm?doc_id=1667   Cyber security strategies in EU MSs – ENISA’s overview at  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/national-cyber-security- strategies-ncsss/national-cyber-security-strategies-in-the-world   Incident reporting and cyber security regulation at  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/Incidents-reporting   Directive on attacks against information systems – ENISA recommendations for CERTs at  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/support/fight-against-cybercrime/the-directive- on-attacks-against-information-systems   European CERT community membership at http://www.terena.org/activities/tf-csirt/   Global CERT community membership at http://www.first.org/members  1 For more recommendations and details on ‘Formal capability’ consult  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/support/baseline-capabilities  2 See RFC2350 for further details about roles and responsibilities  http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:52010DC0245R(01)&from=EN http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:52010DC0245R(01)&from=EN http://ec.europa.eu/information_society/newsroom/cf/dae/document.cfm?doc_id=1667 http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/national-cyber-security-strategies-ncsss/national-cyber-security-strategies-in-the-world http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/national-cyber-security-strategies-ncsss/national-cyber-security-strategies-in-the-world http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/Incidents-reporting http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/support/fight-against-cybercrime/the-directive-on-attacks-against-information-systems http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/support/fight-against-cybercrime/the-directive-on-attacks-against-information-systems http://www.terena.org/activities/tf-csirt/ http://www.first.org/members http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/support/baseline-capabilities  National/governmental CERTs  ENISA’s recommendations on baseline capabilities  Update, December 2014  Page  4  2.2.2 Operational-technical capability (former ‘Service Portfolio’)  The service portfolio of any national / governmental CERT will consist of the external services it  provides to its constituency and its internal support processes. External CERT services are commonly  categorized into three service classes: Proactive, reactive and other security management services.  Reactive services: these services are triggered by an event or request, such as a report of a  compromised host, widespread malicious code, software vulnerability, or something that was  identified by an intrusion detection or logging system. Reactive services are the core component of  CERT work.  Proactive services: these services provide assistance and information to help prepare, protect, and  secure constituent systems in anticipation of attacks, problems, or events. Performance of these  services will directly reduce the number of incidents in the future.  The core baseline services for the constituency remain the same as defined in the first report of 2009  3 (incident response, alerts and warnings and announcements). Additional services could be provided  to the constituency or to the cooperation partners, like artifact analysis, technology watch or more  sophisticated digital forensics analysis for law enforcement agencies in order to support the fight  against cyber crime; however, these are optional and do not count to the baseline.  It should be noted that external services still require appropriate internal support processes such as,  for example, resource or infrastructure management processes. These supporting processes should  also receive adequate consideration as they are the keys to the continuous improvement of the  maturity of a national / governmental CERT.  Internal services might be for example a good situational awareness, technical cyber security trainings  for staff or participation in various cyber security exercises (e.g. Cyber Europe Exercise).  Emerging new service or customised alerts and warnings?  Cyber threat intelligence is nowadays a popular proactive type of service that a team can offer to its  constituency.  The advantage of this service for the team is to be able to issue probability-based warnings of future  cyber attacks and tailore alerts and warnings to the specific risks and threats of the constituency.  Cyber Threat Intelligence is an ‘evidence-based knowledge including context, mechanisms, indicators,  implications and actionable advice about an existing or emerging threat or risk to assets that can be  used to inform decisions regarding the subject’s response to that threat or risk’4.  Based on the provided definition this service should be considered as a subset of  Alerts and Warnings  if provided.

Without operational resources such as staff and infrastructure, a national  / governmental CERT cannot offer the services discussed in the previous chapter. These requirements  has been described in depth in the 2009 report6. The essential aspects of operational-orgnaisational  capability remain the same: resources, infrastructure, service delivery and business continuity.  Resourcing such as minimum staffing for delivering its services and the budget allocation for the  equipment, staff, education also including budget for necessary trust building activities like meetings,  workshops and conferences are indispensable elements of well functioning team and trust building  for an effective incident response coordination.  6  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/support/files/baseline-capabilities-for-national-governmental- certs  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/support/chiht https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/support/incident-management/files/good-practice-guide-for-incident-management https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/support/incident-management/files/good-practice-guide-for-incident-management https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/support/incident-handling-automation https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/support/proactive-detection https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/support/awa https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/support/ActionableInformationforSecurityIncidentResponse.pdf https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/support/ActionableInformationforSecurityIncidentResponse.pdf http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/support/files/baseline-capabilities-for-national-governmental-certs http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/support/files/baseline-capabilities-for-national-governmental-certs  National/governmental CERTs  ENISA’s recommendations on baseline capabilities  Update, December 2014  Page  6  As a national / governmental CERT is both working for the protection of critical infrastructure of a  government and usually acts as a CERT-of-last-resort for all incidents in its constituency, it should be  considered mandatory for the CERT to be reachable 24/7/365 by its constituents and its national and  international partners.  The requirements concerning confidentiality, integrity and availability of the infrastructure for  national / governmental CERTs also remain very stringent because of the role national / governmental  CERTs play in crisis situations (eg, large-scale cyber-attacks),  the confidentiality of the information  processed and stored by a national / governmental CERT (records of incidents, CII vulnerabilities, etc)  and because of the criticality of the infrastructure that a national / governmental CERT helps to protect  (energy, healthcare, communication networks, etc).  Recommended sources for further improvement of Operational-organisational capability through  ENISA’s online best practice library and other sources:   RFC2350 at http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc2350.html   How to measure cost effectiveness for CERT at  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/other-work/introduction-to-return-on-security- investment   Overview about the existing EU MS national / governmental CERTs  in Annex A   Recommended check list for publicly available information about the team in Annex B  2.2.4 Co-operational capability (former ‘Cooperation’)  The security and resilience of national cyber-infrastructure is the joint responsibility of all  stakeholders, including operators, service providers, hardware and software providers, end-users,  public bodies and national governments. These organisations each have their own roles to play in  implementing and operating the national cyber-security, and in order to be effective they must  cooperate closely. If national / governmental CERTs are to meet their objectives, sustained and  effective cooperation at both the national and international levels is indispensible. Threats,  vulnerabilities and subsequent incidents in cyberspace often affect more than one sector or country.  Different situations still require different models of cooperation. A national / governmental CERT can  use different procedures to cooperate with a domestic law enforcement organisation or telecom  operator than it uses to cooperate with another national / governmental CERT on the other side of  the globe. The most important cooperation models remain to be the bi/multi-lateral cooperation and  an association or community.  In Europe, a number of national / governmental CERTs have already established relationships with  other national / governmental CERTs7 and with national and international CERT associations8 and have  reached a significant level of maturity, producing high quality responses and information. They have  also made bilateral agreements within certain groups on the use of common procedures, terminology,  frameworks, standards, etc. Yet a large gap still remains; certain national / governmental CERTs  currently lack the maturity or resources to reach these levels of cooperation. In the field, this gap  translates into a number of difficulties in incident handling cooperation.

Expertise skillset of the team members is an important asset for the daily operation of a team  especially considering its core services delivery. In order to reach and maintain the expected high level  of knowledge and skills in the area of fast evolving cyber security issues a continuous training and  education has to be enabled to the team members.  The problem of trust building goes beyond the world of CERTs and can be applied to any community  made either of individuals or teams that need to collaborate occasionally. Therefore strong emphasis  need to be given to develop this behaviourour type of skills and not only internally within the team,  but also with its constituency and the cooperation partners.

The suggested range of  stakeholders is as wide as the topics and goal to achieve.

    "abstract": "Having a national / governmental CERTs in place that fulfils the requirements for ’baseline capabilities’ as defined in this document is essential for CIIP in all Member States. However these teams should not be considered as the one and only necessary measure a Member State must take in order to ensure adequate protection. CIIP at the national level must always be planned as part of a complete cyber-security strategy, in which a national / governmental CERT plays an important role but is not the only component. The planning of a complete national cyber-security strategy in a Member State is outside the scope of this document."

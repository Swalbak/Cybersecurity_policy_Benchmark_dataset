Executive summary  Distributed ledger technology – commonly referred as Blockchain – has emerged as candidate for financial  institutions to reform their businesses. The speed and cost of doing business using distributed ledger  technology is expected to improve by simplifying back-office operations and lowering the need for human  intervention. However, a number of security concerns around this new technology remains.  Instead of depending on a central entity such as a single financial institution to track the validity of  ownership of funds, a distributed ledger maintains all transactions and holdings and is updated by a  number of counterparties.  The distributed ledger allows counterparties to use smart contracts1 and enhanced transaction privacy.  Updates to the Blockchain or “distributed ledger” leave an audit trail and allow auditing to verify how an  agreement was executed. Blockchain protocols are believed to provide a transaction and application  environment, by using a mix of consensus and transaction protocols to determine valid transactions, as  well as reach agreement on the current state of items such as a contract or account balance.  This paper aims to provide financial professionals in both business and technology roles with an  assessment of the various benefits and challenges that their institutions may encounter when  implementing a distributed ledger. Some of the key challenges of Blockchain identified in the document  are:   Traditional challenges such as:   Key Management   Privacy   Code Review   Technology specific challenges such as:   Key Generation   Smart Contract Management   Scalability  ENISA has also identified good practices to overcome the issues identified as well as introduce the key  concepts that decision-makers should be aware of when approaching this technology. After reviewing the  existing challenges attached to distributed ledgers, some good practices are:   Using recovery keys   Using multiple signatures for authorizing and processing transactions   Using library of standardized smart contracts  1 Szabo, Nick. \"The idea of smart contracts, 1 997.\" (1997).  Distributed Ledger Technology & Cybersecurity  Improving information security in the financial sector | December 2016  06  In this paper, we have also identified that there are challenges that may require further development, such  as:   Anti-money and anti-fraud tools   Interoperability of Blockchain protocols   Legal provisions and tools for implementing privacy and the right to be forgotten  Throughout this paper, we refer to the words Blockchain and distributed ledger interchangeably. Although  they do not always share the exact same underlying technical mechanisms, these technologies often  follow the same principles of allowing counterparties to exchange data and automate contractual  obligations.  Distributed Ledger Technology & Cybersecurity  Improving information security in the financial sector | December 2016  07  2. Drivers of adoption for Financial Institutions (FI)  As financial services move towards digitisation, financial institutions will need to operate lower cost, high  volume payment lines to service their retail business, whilst catering to the increasing demand for security  and mobility. There are also increasing demands for efficiency and transparency from institutional  counterparties and financial services regulators, on business and technology processes.  The main drivers behind the adoption of distributed ledger technology are:   Cost reductions - The opportunity for financial institutions to unplug legacy systems and reduce the  amount of layers required for data sharing. By ensuring data is natively in digital format and shared at  the point of transaction, reconciliation time can also be drastically reduced.   Risk-management - The ability to predict and avoid overextending an institution's liabilities. By  providing a standardised framework for recording even complex transactions such as derivatives,  financial institutions can make it much easier to manage their risks and positions in real time.   Regulatory compliance - compliance with the requirements of various sets of legislation, as well as  conducting only authorised transactions can be automated to a great degree.  Financial institutions currently operate their own database silos, which are then reconciled against each  other to ensure data is valid. Blockchain technology can provide a single distributed ledger of transactions  and messages.  To operate effectively, the financial system requires its actors to fulfil their engagements and comply with  existing legal statutes as well as operate in a structured fashion. This is achieved by a combination of  means, which we refer to as a “governance toolkit”:   Regulation - An authorisation body is appointed, which can designate individuals and firms as  authorised to transact within specific markets. In the wake of the global financial crisis of 2008 and the  resulting increase in regulatory requirements, the additional costs of meeting regulatory compliance  and auditing requirements is evaluated at up to $4Bn yearly2 for some banks.   Audit - The financial institution must make certain business information available to the regulator on a  regular basis, to prove their compliance with specific rules.   Internal Controls - A financial institution will monitor its’ various business lines using a range of risk- management metrics to keep business activity in line with capital and risk requirements. Additionally,  managerial and organisational processes are used to maintain human agent behaviour within  acceptable parameters.   Technology - At any one time, large financial institutions have a number of technology related projects  under development which allow them to transact, report on data or interface with counterparties.  Current technological implementations suffer from having to integrate with previous systems,  resulting in a patchwork of legacy technologies that require ongoing maintenance.  The above tools, applied collectively, allow financial institutions to comply with regulatory requirements,  send transaction messages to counterparties and reconcile data. However, recent years have shown the  extent to which these tools can be insufficient. The “governance toolkit” is vulnerable to either dishonest  human activity, data entry mistakes, or technological shortcomings.  2 Accenture, Investment Banking Technology: Jettisoning legacy architectures, 2015 (link – last accessed August 2016)  https://www.accenture.com/us-en/~/media/Accenture/next-gen/top-ten-challenges/challenge2/pdfs/Accenture-2016-Top-10-Challenges-02-Technology-Legacy-Architectures  Distributed Ledger Technology & Cybersecurity  Improving information security in the financial sector | December 2016  08  Distributed ledger technologies might allow institutions to embed their operating rules within code. From  a governance perspective, this means that the business functions of regulation, audit and internal controls  can be embedded into the transaction system. For example:   Regulation changes  Distributed ledger technology could assist the financial institutions and regulators in a way that once a  new regulation is coded into the distributed ledger it is spread to all, without any need of technical  change required from the counterparties.   Audits  Audits mainly show a status of a given system or organization in a given point in time- distributed  ledger technology could potentially allow for continuous monitoring.   Business logic  At the scale of an individual financial institution, business logic can be programmed into smart  contracts, drastically simplifying back-office operations, especially with regards to data reconciliation  and asset or funds settlement. By establishing a common protocol for transaction and settlements,  financial institutions can move towards near real-time settlement.   If all financial transactions are recorded on regulated ledgers, it might be possible to implement  prudential regulations. For example, this could automatically restrict new transactions that cause  an institution’s balance sheet to exceed risk-management parameters issued by the regulators to  whose jurisdiction the financial institutions are subject.   Reduce the need for internal monitoring  With the support of Blockchain transactions that will now be conducted and settled by software  rather than staff. The requirement for regular data audits will remain, to ensure that the smart  contract has been executed as intended.   Achieve consensus in an uncertain environment  The nature of the distributed ledger allows for reaching consensus over a certain transaction even  when you may not trust the counterparties in the network.  Blockchain technology must not be seen as a replacement to financial institutions for the operation of the  financial system. It is a technological tool, which can be used by parties such as major financial institutions  and regulators to share information and transact more easily whilst maintaining control over their  information.  Distributed Ledger Technology & Cybersecurity  Improving information security in the financial sector | December 2016  09  3. Distributed Ledger Technologies  Here we show key components and properties which we think are important and valuable for the financial  institutions.  Usually, the distributed ledger has the following model (see Figure 1):   All participants share a consistent copy of the database, there is no central server   Some participants might not have a full copy   Network connections are peer-to-peer   Participants must comply with ledger rules   permissionless ledger – anyone could join   permissioned ledger – participation is subject to rules of the members   Using a type of consensus protocol, to agree on validity of a given transaction   Transactions – could be financial and/or exchanging of assets and/or services   Rules for a transaction could be coded into what is called smart contracts   Uses digital signatures (private/public key) to sign and/or encrypt transactions on the ledger   Signatures could be linked to identity   Represents a temporal order of how assets evolve over time  Distributed Ledger Consensus Protocol  Sidechain  key key Copy of the ledgerkey key keyCopy of  the ledger  key key  Copy of the ledger  key Key holder  Copy of the ledger  Smart Contracts  Smart Contracts  Figure 1: Distributed Ledger Ecosystem  Distributed Ledger Technology & Cybersecurity  Improving information security in the financial sector | December 2016  10  Miner  A miner is a participant in a Blockchain that participates in securing the network and validating new  transactions. The mining and validation process happens via either competitive, voting or luck-based  methods dependant on the consensus protocol chosen. Miners are incentivised to participate in a  Blockchain either because they receive mining rewards in the form of cryptocurrency (eg. Bitcoin) or  because they have a vested interest in accessing and exchanging data on that network (such as a business  that chooses to participate in an industry or market-specific Blockchain).  Consensus protocol  The core difference between a distributed ledger and a traditional database is the way in which datasets  evolve over time. The system allows multiple participants to submit new inputs to a distributed ledger.  Consensus is then used to determine over time which state of the database is considered as valid. This is in  contrast to a traditional database, where multiple participants submit new inputs and one counterparty is  relied on to provide the valid state of the database.  Consensus protocols are the mechanisms by which all users within a distributed ledger agree on the  validity of the underlying data.  One of the key aspects of a distributed ledger is that the data held within it, is considered valid because all  parties agree to a single “true” version. In the event that existing participants in a Blockchain decide to  include data in a non-compliant manner with established protocols, an event named a fork occurs.  Forks result in a split of the ledger and the consequent creation of two groups, each validating their  own version of the ledger. In order for participants to be able to continue to interact with each other,  they are required to follow the same fork of the ledger.3  The following table gives a brief overview of main consensus protocols in use:  CONSENSUS PROTOCOL OVERVIEW  Proof of Work  Uses computational power to validate new blocks of data.  To participate in this scheme, participants are required to collate transactions within a  single block and then apply a hash function with the use of some additional metadata.  Proof of Stake  Validators (special nodes) voting on valid blocks whilst posting collateral in order to be able  to participate in the validation process.  Unlike Proof of Work, Proof of Stake relies on proving the user is invested in the underlying  token of value of the network being mined rather than being the owner of a large amount  of computing power  Ripple Protocol  In order to validate new transactions, servers amalgamate outstanding transactions into a  “candidate list.”  All participants then vote on valid transactions to be included in the ledger.  3 A case study of a fork can be found in Annex B of this document  Distributed Ledger Technology & Cybersecurity  Improving information security in the financial sector | December 2016  11  Transactions that meet the 80% threshold of “yes” votes are included within the following  last closed ledger state.  Proof of Elapsed Time  As part of its Intelledger proposal, Intel has devised a means of establishing a validation  lottery that takes advantage of the capability of its CPUs to produce a timestamp  cryptographically signed by the hardware.  Whoever in the chain has the next soonest timestamp will be the one to decide which  transactions will be a part of the next block in the chain.  This consensus method is extremely energy efficient compared to Proof of Work and  therefore more adapted to IoT devices.  Table 1: Consensus protocols  Cryptography  Distributed ledger technology relies on the use of asymmetric cryptography to sign messages and encrypt  data through the use of a private/public key pair. Key sizes depend on the implementation of the ledger  and could vary.  Cryptography is also involved in some of the consensus protocols (e.g. Proof of Work) and is the primary  vehicle in achieving consensus.  The private keys, which allow a given entity to transact with the assets or virtual currency allocated to it in  the Blockchain are typically stored in what is called a wallet. In a given wallet, there could be multiple keys  stored.  Sidechains  The standard operation of a distributed ledger might allow thousands of transactions which in some cases,  might result in slow processing. In an attempt to resolve this problem, one technology that has been  developed is the concept of side chains.   These are the concept of running a separate distributed ledger off of the main chain but with  transactions able to take place in the same currency as the core system   By performing transactions on a such specialized ledger, transactions should be processed faster   Users who are able to see the content of a transaction, may also be restricted depending on that  sidechain’s implementation  Another sidechain4 proposal establishes the idea of pegged sidechains. Pegged sidechains would enable  digital virtual currencies and/or other ledger assets to be transferred between multiple Blockchains.  Smart Contracts  Business activities require counterparties to trust each other, and ensure they share the same  understanding of transaction details. Contractual obligations carry three key characteristics, as outlined by  researcher Nick Szabo5.   Observability  The ability of the principals (parties to the contract) to observe each other’s performance of the  contract, or to prove their performance to other principals.  4 A. Back, M. Corallo, L. Dashjr, M. Friedenbach, G. Maxwell, A. Miller, A. Poelstra, J. Timon, P. Wuille, Enabling  Blockchain Innovations with Pegged Sidechains, 22nd October 2014  5 Nick Szabo, Formalizing and securing relationships on public networks, First Monday Vol. 2 Number 9 September  1997  http://pear.accc.uic.edu/ojs/index.php/fm/article/view/548/469 http://pear.accc.uic.edu/ojs/index.php/fm/article/view/548/469  Distributed Ledger Technology & Cybersecurity  Improving information security in the financial sector | December 2016  12   Verifiability  The ability of a participant in a contractual agreement to prove to an arbitrator that a contract has  been performed or breached, or the ability of the adjudicator to find this out by other means.   Privity  The principle that knowledge and control over the contents and performance of a contract should  be distributed among parties only as much as is necessary for the performance of that contract. A  generalization of the common law principle of contract privity, which states that third parties –  other than the designated adjudicators and designated intermediaries – should have no say in the  enforcement of a contract.  Blockchain-based applications involve the use of smart contracts, a direct application of Szabo’s principles.  Smart Contracts  “Contracts whose terms are recorded in a computer language instead of legal language. Smart contracts  can be automatically executed by a computing system, such as a suitable distributed ledger system.”6  Smart contracts allow participants to verify that counterparties have fulfilled their obligations and  provide for an accelerated, automated, settlement once the required conditions have been met (such as  a payment or asset transfer).  Permissionless Ledgers  A permissionless ledger is defined as a Blockchain protocol where a client may operate a full node without  prior approval (i.e. download a copy of the database and act as a validator for future transactions). The  advantage of a permissionless ledger is that, as it gains adoption, it becomes highly decentralised and  redundant, becoming very difficult to shut down.  Furthermore, applications deployed within a permissionless ledger will be able to natively interact with  other applications on the same ledger. If two applications are on separate ledgers, then a communication  channel becomes required.  Permissioned Ledgers  Permissioned ledgers are a form of distributed ledger that operate as a “members’ club”. In this  environment, the underlying consensus protocol is freely chosen by the group that initiates the protocol.  In the example of a group of financial institutions:   they would agree on a common distributed ledger protocol   Consensus protocols changes could potentially happen if adopted by all the counterparties   Its’ members will be able to vet and add new counterparties, as well as remove existing ones.  Though financial institutions may use permissionless chains to hash some private data as well as trade on  specific public, open, markets, the largest likelihood is that most applications and financial systems will be  implemented as permissioned ledgers, managed by a quorum of counterparties. A permissioned ledger  could allow financial institutions to leverage their real-world reputation. In this case, the FI will not want to  perform malicious actions on the network, as this will damage their brand.  6 UK Government Office for Science, p.18, Distributed Ledger Technology: beyond blockchain, 2016  Distributed Ledger Technology & Cybersecurity  Improving information security in the financial sector | December 2016  13  As outlined, distributed ledger technology offers a novel set of solutions to enable entities to transact with  others in a safer environment. However, the extent to which this is a security improvement will now be the  focus of our next section.  Distributed Ledger Technology & Cybersecurity  Improving information security in the financial sector | December 2016  14  4. Cybersecurity Challenges  In this section we aim to identify the challenges associated with the distributed ledger technology. As this  technology is in its development stage the challenges recognized should not be considered as complete list  of challenges.  The Traditional Challenges  The use of a distributed ledger implies that data is shared between all counterparties on the network. On  one side this could potentially have a negative impact on the confidentiality; while on the other, it has a  positive impact on availability with many nodes participating in the Blockchain, making it more robust and  resilient.  4.1.1 Key Management  Private keys are the direct means of authorizing activities from an account, which in the event they get  accessed by an adversary, will compromise any wallets or assets secured by these keys.  The methodology of the attacks seeking to gain unauthorised access to a system via stolen credentials  remains fundamentally the same- try to capture information, plant malware and/or use social engineering  to steal the private keys from the user’s machine.  Potentially different private keys could be used for signing and encrypting messages across the distributed  ledger. An attacker who obtained encryption keys to a dataset would be able to read the underlying data.  However, if the signing key is secured, they will not be able to modify the data or interact with that smart  contract (providing it has been appropriately designed).  The significance of protecting the private key is due to the fact that actions taking place on a hacker’s  machine, such as file decryption attempts or private key reproduction, are not subject to server imposed  query limits and are run without anyone else being able to notice.  Unlike with traditional systems, where before a server administrator was capable of tracking attempts to  break into a customer or user account, the malicious users can keep trying limitlessly to decrypt or try to  reproduce a private key out of encrypted data from a given ledger. With Blockchain, there is no way of  knowing this is happening until after the hacker has succeeded.  4.1.2 Cryptography  Most Blockchain implementations rely on the cryptographically generated public and private keys to  operate.  Main challenge associated with cryptography is that stringent policies and procedures must be followed  when managing keys, including people, processes and technology.  Usually, the user generates the private and public keys using software, such as the Blockchain client  software, or another available software. It has already been shown, that some programs are generating  keys that have been identified to be weak7. There are also documented8 attempts to spread intentionally  7 Coindesk, Open-Source Tool Identifies Weak Bitcoin Wallet Signatures, October 16th 2014  8 N. Heninger, How not to generate random numbers, May 13th 2015, University of Pennsylvania  Distributed Ledger Technology & Cybersecurity  Improving information security in the financial sector | December 2016  15  weakened random number generators, from which a limited range of possible values can be produced.  Keys generated through these limited random number generators could be more easily brute forced.  Quantum computing may also threaten the premise of asymmetric cryptography. Though it does not  represent an immediate threat, it should be certainly taken into consideration for a future-proof solution.  Popular security algorithms that are used for securing information through a complicated challenge (e.g.  RSA, ElGamal), may now be resolved in a shorter amounts of time through the use of quantum computing.  4.1.3 Privacy  Privacy is an additional issue that emerges from the use of Blockchain technology.  In a permissionless ledger, all counterparties are able to download the ledger, which implies that they  might be able to explore the entire history of transactions, including those to which they were not  members of. The “right to be forgotten” where information needs to be removed from a ledger is  challenging to implement. Usually, many counterparties have the data from the ledger, and it would be  difficult to prove that all data has been deleted.  The solution of Hyperledger for example, offers to solve this by offering a range of commercial privacy  services.  Additionally, there is a challenge with smart contracts being able to access the data in order to process  transactions. Since this is possible, there is possibility that a smart contract might be able to leak  information on what is being processed. In this way, privacy might be breached.  4.1.4 Code review  Whilst many skilled eyes may have reviewed the protocols, methods, and codebase of popular  implementations of distributed ledgers, it remains possible that unknown vulnerabilities exist.  The Distributed Ledger Specific Challenges  In addition to the traditional security concerns, Blockchain brings additional security challenges and attack  vectors. Some of these are unique to specific implementations, and others exist across all designs.  4.2.1 Consensus hijack  In decentralized, permissionless networks, where consensus is formed through majority, taking control of a  large enough portion of participating clients could allow an attacker to tamper the validation process.  In the case of Bitcoin, this is referred to as a “51% attack9” where the majority (defined as the proportion  of all hashing power in the network) is compromised or controlled by the same entity or a coalition of  dishonest counterparties. An attacker would be able to produce new blocks faster than the rest of the  network (in proportion to their computing power) leading participants to consider that chain as valid.  The extent of a 51% attack will allow an attacker to refuse to process certain transactions as well as to  re-use an asset which has already been spent.  There is possibility, that in a permissionless distributed ledger, the computational power required to hijack  the consensus might be cheap enough for a malicious attacker to buy (from a cloud provider for example).  This depends on the number of participants and the computational power required for such case. In  9 I. Eyal, E. Sirer, Majority is not Enough: Bitcoin Mining is not Vulnerable, November 1st 2013  Distributed Ledger Technology & Cybersecurity  Improving information security in the financial sector | December 2016  16  situations like this, even one participant might hold the possibility to validate transactions and direct the  flow of transactions in the ledger. This is contrary to the notion that, usually, in distributed ledgers one  participant doesn’t have enough resources to influence the consensus process.10  Another consequence of such an attack is in the perspective of adoption. Any chain coming under attack  might see an outflow of participants, leading to the question of which chain should be considered as the  “main” one to follow as well as potentially crippling the value of that chain.  Another challenge comes from consensus protocols that do not involve some way of penalty to the  participants. In this way for a malicious user would be easier to attack.  4.2.2 Sidechains  Whereas major Blockchains like Bitcoin and Ethereum have sufficient adoption to be protected by their  mining process against all but the most resourceful attackers, sidechains are more at risk due to their more  specialised focus. Where a user has no interest in tracking the data and maintaining the operation of a  sidechain, they will not contribute the relevant mining power to secure that chain.  Another vulnerability of sidechains consists in the gateway used to transfer assets and messages between  chains. In the case of a Bitcoin sidechain, a user will “lock” Bitcoins in an address on the main Bitcoin  Blockchain and then issue proxy tokens for these on the sidechain. If users can also later exchange  sidechain tokens for the original token, this mechanism is called a 2-way peg. They can then transact with  others on that sidechain. If the initial “locking” transaction is later considered invalid, then subsequent  proxy-token transactions would also be affected. Additionally, owners of proxy tokens that had been  affected would not be able to convert these back to the original asset via the pegging mechanism.  Fraudulent transactions or attacks on a sidechain do not affect the validity of data held on the parent  chain. However, in the event that a sidechain was to be put out of service, the parent chain might be  subjected to high stress levels as the sidechain users migrate their transaction volumes to the parent  chain.  4.2.3 Exploiting Permissioned Blockchains  In a regulated, permissioned network, where consensus might be implemented under the regulator’s  direction, any exploitation of the regulator’s capabilities would be even more and immediately severe. The  extent of the impact depends on the range of capabilities ascribed to the regulator within that specific  system.  All problems that had required hijacking of the majority consensus, a task that was a potentially  significant in undertaking, are now replaced by the hijacking of a single entity.  The challenges created by the above could be mitigated by implementing a fixed-time notice period prior  to regulator-issued major protocol updates being made effective. However, until the intrusion is detected,  malicious activity would still be possible within the scope of the regulator’s ongoing activities, such as  whitelisting individuals or institutions to participate in the system.  10 Eyal, Ittay, and Emin Gün Sirer. \"Majority is not enough: Bitcoin mining is vulnerable.\" International Conference on  Financial Cryptography and Data Security. Springer Berlin Heidelberg, 2014.  Distributed Ledger Technology & Cybersecurity  Improving information security in the financial sector | December 2016  17  4.2.4 Distributed Denial of Service  Distributed Denial of Service attacks coming out of the nature of the distribute ledger remain a concern.  For example, if rogue wallets decide to push large numbers of spam transactions to the network it could  create potentially a denial of service and increase the processing time, as the nodes will be checking the  validity of the fraudulent transactions.  In March 2016, the Bitcoin network was slowed to a near halt. The cause was a Bitcoin wallet pushing large  volumes of spam transactions with a higher than average transaction fee. This caused miners to prioritise  these transactions when computing new blocks.  Within a permissioned ledger, it would be possible for nodes to agree to ignore or even block the issuer of  such spam transactions. However, if an attacker is able to control a large number of clients, they might be  able to severely disrupt the network by pushing large volumes of irrelevant transactions.11  The distributed nature of Blockchain architecture introduces the prospect that it would be difficult to  shut down a malicious program.  With the capabilities of newer protocols offering data storage and computation, it would be possible to  store malicious data within the Blockchain network. Additionally, an attacker could reassign control of the  related smart contract at will, leveraging the trustless nature of the Blockchain to buy and sell malware  between anonymous cryptographic keys12.  4.2.5 Wallet Management  Wallet management represents the process and technology used with which a wallet software operates  with the keys assigned to it. The wallet software would need to protect the keys from being accessed  without authorization, in both cases while stored, but also while in operation with the software.  Losing access to a given wallet might preclude a financial institution from authorising transactions or  moving assets. It might be difficult for an entity to be aware that a malicious user has access to the wallet,  because copying or stealing the keys might not leave any trace on a computer. By the time an entity  understands that the keys are compromised, because of a fraudulent transaction for example, it might be  too late for reversal.  4.2.6 Scalability  Removing the need to reconcile counterparty data introduces a scalability problem. On one hand the  growth of the ledger size and on the other the speed at which transactions are processed.  The need to store all data pertaining to a specific distributed ledger, may grow to be unmanageable in  size for individual end-users.  In the case of a financial market implementation, we assume that major financial institutions act as full  nodes. Where the Bitcoin Blockchain has exceeded 90Gb, the Ethereum Blockchain exceeds 10Gb  (depending on client used).

The speed at which a given transaction is processed, in some implementations of the ledger, may not be  sufficient or acceptable13.  Exposed to the high transaction volumes of financial institutions, a completely distributed ledger might  subject users to performance issues as their machines struggle to maintain an ever growing chain. The  transaction speed also depends on the consensus protocol. In the case of Proof of Work consensus  protocol the validation of transactions needs to be verified by a number of other nodes which requires  processing time. The more participants need to verify a transaction, the more time it will take to be  accepted as valid in the ledger. On one hand, participants might not have sufficiently powerful hardware to  validate a transaction. On the other, the ledger protocol itself would be designed to accommodate more  general requirements, thus bringing more delay. In a consensus protocol that would just use time  stamping, the process of validation will be faster compared to the Proof of Work.  The possibility that only specific transactions are to be verified by specific nodes (validators) is called  Sharding.14 Sharding could also introduce a significant fault (ie. reversion of subsequent transactions) if a  specific subset of validators were to wrongly validate transactions to which other members of that same  Blockchain refer to. This is due to the fact that communication between shards will require the use of  transaction receipts from one shard to communicate with the next.  The process of downloading block headers (which are a hashed version of past data) as well as the  underlying data for most recent blocks and then cross-reference this with other nodes (rather than  downloading the entire database) is called Blockchain pruning. Here, a challenge exists if an attacker were  to convince a user that the fraudulent block headers they verify, are genuine.  4.2.7 Smart Contract Management  Smart contract management refers to the people, processes and technology used when creating a smart  contract.  Smart contracts are essentially programs that run on the distributed ledger. They are prone to any faults  associated with code. As with any software, the more complex a smart contract is, the more prone to  software errors it will be.  Generally, the function, and the security of smart contracts code depends on the author’s capabilities.  A review by Peter Vessenes15 found that large numbers of template contracts available on the web for the  Ethereum scripting system contained significant vulnerabilities to their operation.  13 Note: For reference, at the time of writing the Bitcoin transactions are limited to 7(seven) per second, Visa handles  at an average of 2000 (two thousand) per second  14 V. Buterin, DEVCON1: Scalable Blockchains & Asynchronous Programming, Nov. 9th 2015  15 P. Vessenes, Ethereum Contracts are Going to be Candy for Hackers, May 18th 2016  http://vessenes.com/ethereum-contracts-are-going-to-be-candy-for-hackers/  Distributed Ledger Technology & Cybersecurity  Improving information security in the financial sector | December 2016  19  On June 2016 an attack on the DAO16 took place, which was an investment vehicle created on the  Ethereum network and operated as a smart contract. Over $59m in Ether17 were stolen by an unknown  source from the wallet controlled by the program on behalf of all investors.  4.2.8 Interoperability  Using different distributed ledgers will very likely bring the need of data sharing between them.  Exchanging data will require translation of formats and protocols, which currently are in very early  stages.  Also having to reconcile transactions between different distributed ledger brings another challenge to  consider, as different consensus protocols might not be easy to transpose from one to another. Key  challenges related to interoperability are:   Who can transfer assets between distributed ledgers?   Who can oppose to transferring assets?   Should transfers allow for whole asset or just part of it?   Should changes of ownership or asset (theft, loss) be also proliferated to the other chains?  Another interoperability challenge arises from the use of wallet software with different distributed ledgers.  Currently, most distributed ledgers come with their own wallet software, and it is difficult to have a  common wallet for different distributed ledgers.  4.2.9 Governance controls  Institutions still need their staff to sign off on requests and transactions, though a distributed ledger may  transparently indicate which financial institution was involved in a transaction. A challenge becomes how  exactly the governance structure could be coded into the distributed ledger.  Another aspect of governance lies at the systemic level, where some institutions may have rules  concerning which business activities they can engage in. For example, in the distributed ledger there might  be rules for some financial institutions to be allowed to transact with only specific entities, or provide only  specific services.  4.2.10 Anti-fraud and Anti-Money Laundering Tools  Another key problem is a lack of tools to combat illegal activity. Though it might be possible to identify  who owns an address used for money laundering despite attempts at obfuscating the transaction18, it is  not possible to block these types of transactions in advance. Also, the consensus-based nature of adoption  combined with the cross-application and industry aspirations of Blockchain technology means protocols  may not evolve sufficiently fast or in correlation with more complex business needs.  The European Commission has already begun researching the foundations of a Public Key Infrastructure,  that will impose Anti-Money Laundering (AML) compliance on all entities acting as gateways towards the  16 See annex B  17 Zerohedge, Bitcoin's Largest Competitor Hacked: Over $59 Million \"Ethers\" Stolen In Ongoing Attack, June 17th 2016  18 M.

Within the financial sector, this could give way to a whitelist of approved public  keys whose owners are institutions and professionals who have been allowed to transact.19  Another issue that arises with users is that the Blockchain network could be more trustworthy than the  machine used to access it. Hence, though the record of the transactions would be verifiable, the intent to  perform that transaction might not be. An example of this would consist in the transfer of a large sum of  money. Because it happens on a distributed ledger, the transaction is visible and verifiable by all other  entities on that ledger. However, the owner of the wallet may not have had the intent of making such a  transfer and been subject to a hack. The decentralised chain design also means that it is not possible to  simply revert previous actions.  A further potential vulnerability lies not just in the consensus protocol, which exists to provide an accurate  historical presentation, but in the transaction protocol used to broadcast messages to the rest of the  network. Fraudulent transactions exist in various types:   Double-spending: This involves sending two transactions, one of which will cancel the other. In the  example of Bitcoin, until the UTxO set of the Blockchain has been sufficiently confirmed after enough  time, counterparties expose themselves to the possibility that the payment received will be invalid.   Hacked key: This type of transaction is broadcast to the network but has not been conducted by the  true owner. This happens when a third party obtains unauthorised access to a key.   Non-compliant transaction: This type of transaction is mainly applicable to permissioned, regulated  networks. It involves broadcasting a message either from an unauthorised address or against pre- defined business rules. Hyperledger solves this issue with a blend of enrolment (authorisation)  certificates and single use transaction certificates to allow transactions.  19 European Commission, p.7 Proposal for amending Directive (EU) 2015/849 on the prevention of the use of the  financial system for the purposes of money laundering or terrorist financing, 2016  Distributed Ledger Technology & Cybersecurity  Improving information security in the financial sector | December 2016  21  5.

Distributed Ledger Technology & Cybersecurity  Improving information security in the financial sector | December 2016  25  Annex A: Blockchain Use Cases  Blockchain technology holds a significant promise for the financial sector. It simplifies many types of  business transaction and has significant applications within the non-financial sector.  A.1 Executing and settling contractual agreements  The current process behind an investment in shares requires for counterparties to hold both a bank  account and their shares with institutions that can assist with the settlement of their trade. In contrast, a  share trade accomplished through a distributed ledger can be settled instantly. Furthermore, as soon as a  user receives their share tokens, is able to receive dividends and vote on proposals from the originating  company. A share token is a digital version of a share certificate. However, rather than owning a paper  certificate specifying ownership of shares, a shareholder owns digital tokens, representing the equivalent  of shares. Due to the fact that smart contracts are legal contracts embedded in code, it therefore becomes  possible to assign the attached rights to various classes of shares to these tokens.  In the case of more complex financial instruments such as derivatives, it is possible to program the  execution of settlements following external events. Additionally, what were previously complex paper  contracts can now be encoded into software, allowing financial institutions to assign a data-based  framework to keep track of liabilities.  A.2 Reconciling and auditing information  Current processes require a financial institution to reconcile data internally then across business lines.  Using Blockchain technology, institutions can eliminate double-entry accounting by connecting Back-office  transaction processing to the initiator of a transaction. Furthermore, instead of preparing cyclical reports  and audits for regulators, it will be possible to communicate data in real-time, allowing for a more efficient  implementation of regulatory requirements and risk monitoring.  A.3 Signing messages on behalf of a counterparty  A good example of this is undertaking a proof of funds action. Whereas a client involved in import/export  financing would need to request a letter from their bank, they can now sign a message on the Blockchain  to prove they have the funds available. One way to do this is to simply transfer the funds to another wallet  which the user has access to. In advance of the transaction, and then inform the counterparty of the wallet  addresses to monitor. Other users on the Blockchain will only be able to identify that a transaction  between two anonymous public keys has happened. Furthermore, it is technically feasible to encrypt the  amount of a transaction, thus obscuring amounts to third parties.  A.4 Connecting systems to IoT enabled devices  Blockchain technology will facilitate the development of large amounts of connected devices. By enabling  their systems to interface with the data generated for these devices, financial institutions can obtain real-  Distributed Ledger Technology & Cybersecurity  Improving information security in the financial sector | December 2016  26  time data for a range of matters such as destructive weather (for insurers), client location (fraud  prevention), production facility status (valuation of a business).  A.5 Facilitating the transfer of assets  Registering and transferring the ownership of an asset can be a complex process involving multiple  information silos. In the case of a residential property, relevant surveys must be carried out and  intervention of a central counterparty, such as the Land Registry, is required in order to effectively record  the transfer of ownership. A distributed ledger may enable property titles to be freely exchanged and  linked to smart objects, such as an electronic lock that only opens for a specific key. Because the ledger is  timestamped, it would also be possible for an arbitrator to verify who made the first claim in the case two  counterparties were in dispute over a property. As soon as a property is transferred, this could also be  made visible to the property buyer’s bank, who would then be able to offer a variety of collateral-backed  financial products.  $  Bank A  $  Bank BBank A Ledger  Alice Bob  Bank B Ledger  $  Clearing House  $  Bank Correspondent A  $  Bank Correspondent B  Bank B Correspondent  Ledger  Bank A Correspondent  Ledger Clearing House Ledger  Distributed Ledger Technology & Cybersecurity  Improving information security in the financial sector | December 2016  27  $  Bank A  $  Bank B  Alice Bob  Same Copy  of the  Ledger  Same Copy  of the  Ledger  Smart  Contract  Same Copy  of the  Ledger  Same Copy  of the  Ledger  A.6 Automating regulatory compliance  Prudential regulation defines the capital requirements needed by financial institution to function  effectively. If all trades are happening on distributed ledgers with the information encrypted to transaction  counterparties and the regulator, it becomes possible to calculate in near real-time an institutions’  financial position and whether additional transactions will cause it to exceed the defined risk management  parameters and capital requirements. Another application from a regulatory perspective lies in enforcing  sanctions and closing access to specific markets if participants do not meet the criteria.  A.7 Portable Identity  Distributed ledgers have the advantage of using cryptography rather than user credentials. This means that  participants in a ledger can produce their own identity by generating a private key only they have access  to. The entity (individual or business) can then port its identity across different services as long as it uses  the same address.  A.8 Automated companies and investment vehicles  Smart contracts make it much easier to conduct corporate governance. This includes automating the  shareholder listing, recording board decisions and allocating assets. Financial institutions will be able to  Distributed Ledger Technology & Cybersecurity  Improving information security in the financial sector | December 2016  28  take advantage of smart contracts by quickly instantiating investment vehicles on a distributed ledger  whilst subjecting them to regulatory requirements. Because assets and funds can interact through a  Blockchain, smart contract-based investment vehicles will be able to accurately manage the holdings of a  business with full transparency.  Additionally, the issuance of new shares as well as trading of outstanding shares can be conducted through  the ledger. Financial institutions can choose to trade within existing liquidity pools. However, their  settlement can be linked to the Blockchain in order to improve the efficiency of trading activity.  Distributed Ledger Technology & Cybersecurity  Improving information security in the financial sector | December 2016  29  Annex B: A study of the Ethereum DAO hack  Ether is the currency of the Ethereum Blockchain, with the second highest capitalisation in the digital  currency market. Following its developer-focused Frontier release in July 2015, Ethereum released  Homestead, the first production-grade version of the protocol, in March 2016. Since inception, Ethereum  has been designed to allow for a range of applications rather than being limited to digital currency. A  private version of the Ethereum network has even been used22 by the R3 Consortium, a group of banks  conducting an evaluation of Blockchain technology.  A range23 of independently developed Decentralised Applications (DApps) are already in existence on the  Ethereum network. These range from identity record lookup and validation to Blockchain-chartered  companies, prediction markets and notary services. However, the main issue as with any new technology is  that of adoption. Within the world of decentralised ledgers, this can happen in two ways, either bottom-up  grassroots adoption or through the integration of Blockchain technology to the technology stacks of  existing commercial service providers. The first major demonstration of the potential of a decentralised  computer (Ethereum Virtual Machine) was the launch of the Decentralised Autonomous Organisation  (DAO)24. This smart-contract based investment vehicle is aimed at providing a collective fund through  which token holders can vote on investments and contractors to undertake specific ventures or tasks.  After a token sale (similar to IPO) in May 2016, the DAO raised over 11.5 Million Ether25 (equivalent to over  €140 million). This also represented over 13% of all Ether in existence at the time. On June 17th 2016, the  DAO came under an attack known as a “recursive split.”26 Investors in a DAO can choose to separate from  the existing vehicle and take their funds with them. In this case, a split function occurred, initiating a  withdrawal. However, the function was called recursively, blocking the invocation of the function which  updates the user’s token balance, and therefore allowing them to withdraw more funds than they were  otherwise entitled to.  In response, a protocol update27 was proposed within the same month and adopted28 on July 20th. This  protocol reverted the previous transactions to an address accessible by the original DAO investors,  enabling them to withdraw their funds. Within a day, nearly half the original investors had been able to  recover their Ether.  The DAO hack is an example of how participants in a distributed ledger can, by consensus, overcome major  security events. However, this also introduces the possibility of reverting past transactions, an issue which  would mean that participants who transacted after the attack would have their transactions effectively  nullified. This has resulted in a hard fork and the creation of a second Blockchain, “Ethereum Classic” which  does not recognise the reversion of the attack as valid.  22 Coindesk, Ethereum Blockchain Project Launches First Production Release, March 14th 2016  23 Ethereum DApps  24 DAOHub  25 New York Times, A Hacking of More Than $50 Million Dashes Hopes in the World of Virtual Currency, June 17th 2016  26 Hacking Distributed, Analysis of the DAO exploit, June 18th 2016  27 Ethereum Blog, CRITICAL UPDATE Re: DAO Vulnerability, June 17th 2016  28 Coindesk, Ethereum Executes Blockchain Hard Fork to Return DAO Funds, July 20th 2016  Distributed Ledger Technology & Cybersecurity  Improving information security in the financial sector | December 2016  30  Annex C: Distributed Ledgers  Bitcoin  The main cryptocurrency by market capitalisation and the most widely known implementation of the  Blockchain concept, Bitcoin has operated without any central authority since 2009. There are now over  15m bitcoins in existence, with a market capitalisation of close to 8Bn Euros.  Bitcoin contains a very basic scripting language, called Script, making simple smart contracts a possibility.  Script does not support loops and acts mainly as a tool to place parameters on how Bitcoins can be spent  once they arrive at their destination.  Bitcoin uses a distributed ledger of transactions from which it is possible to compute the Unspent  Transaction Output set, or UTxO. From a more practical perspective, this means that wallets’ publicly  exposed addresses (ie. unique identifiers) are not simply links to a set amount or asset. Rather, they are  the most recent link in a publicly verifiable historical trail of transactions which ends at that address.  Open networks such as Bitcoin need to allow for an unbounded number of participants. The challenge that  therefore arises is for a large number of parties who do not know each other and may not trust each other  to arrive at an agreement about the truth of a given transaction. Bitcoin solves this problem with the use  of a proof of work algorithm. In order for messages to be considered valid, they must be compressed into a  block of data, which is appended to the existing database. This concept of validating a set of messages is  referred to as mining.  The economic connotation of the term of mining refers to the fact that in the Bitcoin implementation,  peers are given an incentive to maintain the system. Each new block in the Blockchain is the result of a  competition by miners to provide a valid set of transactions in a block. Miners that successfully submit the  next block receive a reward, denominated in the crypto-token linked to that specific Blockchain. For  example, every 10 minutes on average, one of the miners on the Bitcoin Blockchain currently receives 12.5  Bitcoin (approx. 6 700 Euros29) for solving the current block.  For the system to function, peers must be able to ascertain that the information they have been presented  with is truthful. Additionally, there should be a disincentive for dishonest actors to overtake the system.  The proof of work function makes it unlikely for 2 parties to arrive at a valid conclusion to the challenge at  the same time. However, it remains a possibility. When this happens, a fork may develop in the Blockchain  with two separate chains proceeding. To stop these forks from continuing, and to ensure there is only ever  one chain, clients accept the longest chain above all others. As a result, the two chains at the fork enter a  race condition to see who can become the longest first, with the smaller one being discarded.  The issue that arises with a distributed ledger is guaranteeing that, as the dataset evolves over time, older  data is not subject to modification. To avoid this, all previous blocks in the system are included in the hash  for the most recent block. This is referred to as a Merkle proof3031. The Bitcoin implementation features a  chain of blocks. Each block contains a block header with 6 elements:  29 Based on an XBT/EUR rate of € 533.92 on Aug. 8th 2016  30 US Patent No 4309569, Filed September 1979  31 Ethereum Blog, Merkling in Ethereum, November 15th 2015  Distributed Ledger Technology & Cybersecurity  Improving information security in the financial sector | December 2016  31   Block version - Specifies the version of the Blockchain the mining software is generating for.   Hash of previous block header - A hashed version of the previous block header.   Hash of Merkle Root (Transactions in Block) - A hash of all transactions/messages in the current block.   Timestamp - The time of publication of the block.   Bits - A 256 bit number that acts as a target for miners to produce a hash under the value of in order to  generate a valid block.   Nonce - A random number to allow for different hash outputs for a block on each attempt.  In order to produce a block, miners pick a set of transactions to validate and hash them using a SHA-256  algorithm. If the resulting hash is a lower number than the Bits, then it is considered a valid solution and is  broadcast to the rest of the network. If it isn’t, the nonce is changed for each hashing run until an output  lower than the Bits is found.  The algorithm used for proof of work requires the entity running the computation to contribute  computational power. The probability of submitting the valid solution to a block is proportional to the total  amount of computing power contributed by that user during the time window necessary to find the most  recent valid block. The proof of work algorithm has enabled Bitcoin to operate for over 7 years. However,  one of its main flaws resides in the fact that it consumes a large amount of energy. The first unintended  consequence is that this creates a drive towards centralisation of mining capacity due to economies of  scale to be achieved on hardware and electricity. Additionally, based on current projections, Bitcoin may  consume as much electricity as Denmark by 202032. As such, research for other needed solutions has  resulted in alternative proposals that can lower electricity consumption without impacting data security.  Ethereum  Ethereum was founded in 2013 and launched in 2015 after a successful crowdfunding campaign which  raised over $18m in Bitcoin. To date there are over 80m Ether in circulation, with a market capitalisation  approaching 1Bn Euros.  Ethereum offers the same range of computational abilities as existing real-world systems, and in particular  supporting loops and conditional statements. The inherent design of the system means that smart contract  code and its’ execution are open for review by all parties. Ether is a form of payment made by the clients  of the platform to the machines executing the requested operations.  A variety of languages have been developed to support smart contracts. Ethereum's virtual machine runs  on byte code, which can now be compiled out of many traditional languages including Javascript and C++.  Solidity is a new High Level Language developed specifically for Ethereum contracts, similar to Javascript,  designed to make complex smart contracts as easy to write as possible.  Whereas Bitcoin blocks contain transaction messages, Ethereum blocks contain messages representing  computational steps of the execution of a smart contract. This computation is funded by subunits of Ether,  more commonly referred to as “gas”. All execution fees are paid by the entity issuing the instruction and  are included within the mining rewards for that specific block. Blocks on the Ethereum chain are currently  also validated using a proof of work algorithm; however, it is in the process of switching to Proof of Stake.  32 Breitbart, Bitcoin may consume as much electricity as Denmark by 2020, April 3rd 2016  http://www.breitbart.com/tech/2016/04/03/bitcoin-could-consume-as-much-energy-as-denmark-by-2020/  Distributed Ledger Technology & Cybersecurity  Improving information security in the financial sector | December 2016  32  Ripple  Already in use by a number of financial institutions, Ripple33 provides a Peer to Peer system for banks in  foreign exchange (FX) markets to transact with each other. The global ledger is replicated by thousands of  participants. FX trades take place through a distributed order book, where all bids and asks are recorded  and executed. Ripple relies on the concept of “gateways”. Hence, in order for a user to move their fiat (i.e.  account balances denominated in government-issued currencies such as EUR, GBP etc) balance out of the  Ripple network, they will need to request a settlement from the entity that initially issued that balance on  the network. Therefore, Ripple still contains a degree of counterparty risk as users are required to trust  that they will be able to receive an effective settlement of their funds.  Hyperledger  The wide variety of applications for distributed ledger technology also means there is a large amount of  potential optimization to be done, as some protocols may be more appropriate in certain circumstances  depending on who is building them and for what. Recognition of this has led to the development of  Hyperledger, which is being developed by a consortium of finance and technology companies, led by the  Linux Foundation. Hyperledger34 is focused on developing a standard for distributed ledgers that will  allow separate ledgers to communicate with one another without needing bespoke APIs. From a security  perspective, Hyperledger uses two types of certificate:   Enrolment certificates: Controls a participants’ access to the network   Single use Transaction Certificates: Restricts the ability to push undesirable transactions  Hyperledger refers to this common standard as Fabric, and intends for smart contracts to be writeable on  this platform in any common programming language. The aim is to produce a completely modular system  that will allow everything – from the cryptography used to the underlying consensus protocol – to be easily  customized and deployed with as little effort as possible. The key driver of Hyperledger’s modular  approach is to allow business participants to determine the consensus protocol to use, following their  business needs.  Sawtooth Lake/Intelledger  Sawtooth Lake35 is an open source project developed by Intel, who are also participating in the  Hyperledger initiative. Founded on the same principles as Hyperledger, but with a slightly different focus,  its’ primary goal is to operate on IoT devices with limited human involvement.  Sawtooth Lake abstracts the core concept of consensus by isolating consensus from transaction semantics.  It provides two consensus protocols with different performance trade-offs; Proof of Elapsed Time and  Quorum voting, an adaptation of the Ripple protocol.  This project is currently in early development, with an alpha release simulating the token generation  function of the segregated secure CPU unit without the actual underlying hardware. However, some key  questions remain about this system, including Intel’s access and knowledge of the cryptographic keys on  the hardware. Additionally, it is not clear whether or not it is possible for a hacker to extract the keys to  33 Ripple, Executive Summary for financial institutions  34 Hyperledger Foundation  35 Intelledger developer documentation  Distributed Ledger Technology & Cybersecurity  Improving information security in the financial sector | December 2016  33  create timestamps that will assure them victory in the consensus determining lottery by decapping the  chips. Another question that remains is whether or not the range of hardware that will work in this system  can be expanded without being vendor-locked.  Corda  Corda is a distributed ledger for contracts tailored for use by financial institutions. It rethinks a number of  the assumed required components of their design. Transactions/agreements, are only visible to parties  with a need to see them, including a definable regulator. In this setting, the regulator could be an authority  such as the European Banking Authority or an industry body defining a set of standards market participants  are required to adhere to. Corda36 has no cryptocurrency, as these parties alone are also the validators of  the agreement taking place, with multiple consensus mechanisms potentially being used.  Corda aims to provide a global distributed ledger, where transactions serve as authoritative and binding  facts to ascribe contractual obligations to counterparties37. To this effect the behaviour of the system is  designed in code and backed by a legal framework which outlines the obligations of participants. Corda is  designed to allow a number of financial transactions, including enabling financial institutions to issue  digital fiat currency to counterparties. In turn, these Blockchain-based funds can be used for trading and  settlement.  36 R3 Blog, Introducing R3 Corda a distributed ledger designed for financial services, April 5th 2016  37 R. G.

A  DAO serves as a proxy to represent a real-world entity or grouping of entities.  Proof of Elapsed Time  As part of its Intelledger proposal, Intel has devised a means of establishing a validation lottery that takes  advantage of the capability of its CPUs to produce a timestamp cryptographically signed by the hardware.  Whoever in the ecosystem has the next soonest timestamp will be the one to decide which transactions  will be a part of the next block in the chain. This consensus method is extremely energy efficient compared  to Proof of Work and therefore more adapted to IoT devices. Proof of Elapsed time does not require a  Public Key Infrastructure. Assets with compatible hardware can simply be added to the network and  immediately participate in the validation process.  Ripple Protocol  The Ripple consensus protocol operates a ledger system. The last closed ledger is the most recent ledger  validated by the consensus process and can be accepted as representing the current state of the database.  In order to validate new transactions, servers amalgamate outstanding transactions into a “candidate list.”  All participants then vote on valid transactions to be included in the ledger. Transactions that meet the  80% threshold of “yes” votes are included within the following last closed ledger state.  Proof of Work  Proof of Work uses computational power to validate new blocks of data. To participate in this scheme,  participants are required to collate transactions within a single block and then apply a hash function with  the use of some additional metadata. If the resulting hash falls within the acceptable range set by the  current difficulty parameters of the proof of work scheme, then that block is considered valid and is  broadcast to the rest of the network as a valid submission. The probability of creating a valid block for any  individual miner is defined by the proportion of computing power held by that miner in comparison with  the rest of the network.  Proof of Stake  This consensus protocol is based on the validators voting on valid blocks whilst posting collateral in order  to be able to participate in the validation process. Unlike Proof of Work, Proof of Stake relies on proving  the user is invested in the underlying token of value of the network being mined rather than being the  owner of a large amount of computing power. Ethereum will use the Casper protocol variant. This  implementation of Proof of Stake sees all validators on the network undergo an iterative voting process on  the next valid block. Votes are made in the form of cryptocurrency, which is locked as a deposit until  consensus has been reached. The next valid block is the one which has the majority of deposits (at least  51%) allocated to it. Due to the iterative voting process, a validator that suddenly switches their vote to a  completely different block may forfeit their deposit. Proof of Stake additionally allows miners to focus  computing resources on processing more transactions per second rather than producing a large number of  hashes as in Proof of Work.  Quantum Computing  Quantum Computing is a new computing paradigm. It involves the use of quantum based phenomena. One  of the main benefits is opening the way for even smaller computers. This is especially relevant due to  Distributed Ledger Technology & Cybersecurity  Improving information security in the financial sector | December 2016  35  quantum tunnelling, an issue which arises for chips below 10nm as electrons begin to jump across closed  transistor gates. Quantum computers use “qubits” instead of conventional bits of information. These  qubits may take the form of an electron trapped inside a cage of atoms or the polarisation of laser light.  Other forms of quantum computers involve using molecules and observing their spin in order to  reconstruct information. Although quantum computers may potentially offer exponential computing  capabilities for specific tasks (such as brute-forcing attacks), they are still highly experimental.  Reconciliation  Reconciliation is the process by which individuals, companies and institutions must ensure all records are  valid and all instructions effectively executed. Reconciliation firstly involves ensuring all the internal data of  an organisation has been correctly captured and is in line with existing policies and rules. The second  element involves ensuring that, where data is shared with external counterparties, both parties hold the  same copy of that information. Blockchain technology promises for a large simplification of the  reconciliation process as data will be shared at the point of origin.  Double Spend  Double-spending is the result of successfully spending some money or an asset more than once. Double  spend attacks can mainly occur when the network has not yet processed a previous transaction from an  address.  Unspent Transaction Output Set (UTxO)  One of the key elements of a Blockchain is that data is considered valid in reference to previous data.  Hence, in the example of Bitcoin, the UTxO is the list of all current Bitcoin addresses which have previously  received funds and have not yet been spent. Each address can be linked to all the previous transactions  that resulted in the funds being routed to that address.

Executive summary  Distributed ledger technology – commonly referred as Blockchain – has emerged as candidate for financial  institutions to reform their businesses. The speed and cost of doing business using distributed ledger  technology is expected to improve by simplifying back-office operations and lowering the need for human  intervention. However, a number of security concerns around this new technology remains.  Instead of depending on a central entity such as a single financial institution to track the validity of  ownership of funds, a distributed ledger maintains all transactions and holdings and is updated by a  number of counterparties.  The distributed ledger allows counterparties to use smart contracts1 and enhanced transaction privacy.  Updates to the Blockchain or “distributed ledger” leave an audit trail and allow auditing to verify how an  agreement was executed. Blockchain protocols are believed to provide a transaction and application  environment, by using a mix of consensus and transaction protocols to determine valid transactions, as  well as reach agreement on the current state of items such as a contract or account balance.  This paper aims to provide financial professionals in both business and technology roles with an  assessment of the various benefits and challenges that their institutions may encounter when  implementing a distributed ledger. Some of the key challenges of Blockchain identified in the document  are:   Traditional challenges such as:   Key Management   Privacy   Code Review   Technology specific challenges such as:   Key Generation   Smart Contract Management   Scalability  ENISA has also identified good practices to overcome the issues identified as well as introduce the key  concepts that decision-makers should be aware of when approaching this technology. After reviewing the  existing challenges attached to distributed ledgers, some good practices are:   Using recovery keys   Using multiple signatures for authorizing and processing transactions   Using library of standardized smart contracts  1 Szabo, Nick. \"The idea of smart contracts, 1 997.\" (1997).  Distributed Ledger Technology & Cybersecurity  Improving information security in the financial sector | December 2016  06  In this paper, we have also identified that there are challenges that may require further development, such  as:   Anti-money and anti-fraud tools   Interoperability of Blockchain protocols   Legal provisions and tools for implementing privacy and the right to be forgotten  Throughout this paper, we refer to the words Blockchain and distributed ledger interchangeably. Although  they do not always share the exact same underlying technical mechanisms, these technologies often  follow the same principles of allowing counterparties to exchange data and automate contractual  obligations.  Distributed Ledger Technology & Cybersecurity  Improving information security in the financial sector | December 2016  07  2. Drivers of adoption for Financial Institutions (FI)  As financial services move towards digitisation, financial institutions will need to operate lower cost, high  volume payment lines to service their retail business, whilst catering to the increasing demand for security  and mobility. There are also increasing demands for efficiency and transparency from institutional  counterparties and financial services regulators, on business and technology processes.  The main drivers behind the adoption of distributed ledger technology are:   Cost reductions - The opportunity for financial institutions to unplug legacy systems and reduce the  amount of layers required for data sharing. By ensuring data is natively in digital format and shared at  the point of transaction, reconciliation time can also be drastically reduced.   Risk-management - The ability to predict and avoid overextending an institution's liabilities. By  providing a standardised framework for recording even complex transactions such as derivatives,  financial institutions can make it much easier to manage their risks and positions in real time.   Regulatory compliance - compliance with the requirements of various sets of legislation, as well as  conducting only authorised transactions can be automated to a great degree.  Financial institutions currently operate their own database silos, which are then reconciled against each  other to ensure data is valid. Blockchain technology can provide a single distributed ledger of transactions  and messages.  To operate effectively, the financial system requires its actors to fulfil their engagements and comply with  existing legal statutes as well as operate in a structured fashion. This is achieved by a combination of  means, which we refer to as a “governance toolkit”:   Regulation - An authorisation body is appointed, which can designate individuals and firms as  authorised to transact within specific markets. In the wake of the global financial crisis of 2008 and the  resulting increase in regulatory requirements, the additional costs of meeting regulatory compliance  and auditing requirements is evaluated at up to $4Bn yearly2 for some banks.   Audit - The financial institution must make certain business information available to the regulator on a  regular basis, to prove their compliance with specific rules.   Internal Controls - A financial institution will monitor its’ various business lines using a range of risk- management metrics to keep business activity in line with capital and risk requirements. Additionally,  managerial and organisational processes are used to maintain human agent behaviour within  acceptable parameters.   Technology - At any one time, large financial institutions have a number of technology related projects  under development which allow them to transact, report on data or interface with counterparties.  Current technological implementations suffer from having to integrate with previous systems,  resulting in a patchwork of legacy technologies that require ongoing maintenance.  The above tools, applied collectively, allow financial institutions to comply with regulatory requirements,  send transaction messages to counterparties and reconcile data. However, recent years have shown the  extent to which these tools can be insufficient. The “governance toolkit” is vulnerable to either dishonest  human activity, data entry mistakes, or technological shortcomings.  2 Accenture, Investment Banking Technology: Jettisoning legacy architectures, 2015 (link – last accessed August 2016)  https://www.accenture.com/us-en/~/media/Accenture/next-gen/top-ten-challenges/challenge2/pdfs/Accenture-2016-Top-10-Challenges-02-Technology-Legacy-Architectures  Distributed Ledger Technology & Cybersecurity  Improving information security in the financial sector | December 2016  08  Distributed ledger technologies might allow institutions to embed their operating rules within code. From  a governance perspective, this means that the business functions of regulation, audit and internal controls  can be embedded into the transaction system. For example:   Regulation changes  Distributed ledger technology could assist the financial institutions and regulators in a way that once a  new regulation is coded into the distributed ledger it is spread to all, without any need of technical  change required from the counterparties.   Audits  Audits mainly show a status of a given system or organization in a given point in time- distributed  ledger technology could potentially allow for continuous monitoring.   Business logic  At the scale of an individual financial institution, business logic can be programmed into smart  contracts, drastically simplifying back-office operations, especially with regards to data reconciliation  and asset or funds settlement. By establishing a common protocol for transaction and settlements,  financial institutions can move towards near real-time settlement.   If all financial transactions are recorded on regulated ledgers, it might be possible to implement  prudential regulations. For example, this could automatically restrict new transactions that cause  an institution’s balance sheet to exceed risk-management parameters issued by the regulators to  whose jurisdiction the financial institutions are subject.   Reduce the need for internal monitoring  With the support of Blockchain transactions that will now be conducted and settled by software  rather than staff. The requirement for regular data audits will remain, to ensure that the smart  contract has been executed as intended.   Achieve consensus in an uncertain environment  The nature of the distributed ledger allows for reaching consensus over a certain transaction even  when you may not trust the counterparties in the network.  Blockchain technology must not be seen as a replacement to financial institutions for the operation of the  financial system. It is a technological tool, which can be used by parties such as major financial institutions  and regulators to share information and transact more easily whilst maintaining control over their  information.  Distributed Ledger Technology & Cybersecurity  Improving information security in the financial sector | December 2016  09  3. Distributed Ledger Technologies  Here we show key components and properties which we think are important and valuable for the financial  institutions.  Usually, the distributed ledger has the following model (see Figure 1):   All participants share a consistent copy of the database, there is no central server   Some participants might not have a full copy   Network connections are peer-to-peer   Participants must comply with ledger rules   permissionless ledger – anyone could join   permissioned ledger – participation is subject to rules of the members   Using a type of consensus protocol, to agree on validity of a given transaction   Transactions – could be financial and/or exchanging of assets and/or services   Rules for a transaction could be coded into what is called smart contracts   Uses digital signatures (private/public key) to sign and/or encrypt transactions on the ledger   Signatures could be linked to identity   Represents a temporal order of how assets evolve over time  Distributed Ledger Consensus Protocol  Sidechain  key key Copy of the ledgerkey key keyCopy of  the ledger  key key  Copy of the ledger  key Key holder  Copy of the ledger  Smart Contracts  Smart Contracts  Figure 1: Distributed Ledger Ecosystem  Distributed Ledger Technology & Cybersecurity  Improving information security in the financial sector | December 2016  10  Miner  A miner is a participant in a Blockchain that participates in securing the network and validating new  transactions. The mining and validation process happens via either competitive, voting or luck-based  methods dependant on the consensus protocol chosen. Miners are incentivised to participate in a  Blockchain either because they receive mining rewards in the form of cryptocurrency (eg. Bitcoin) or  because they have a vested interest in accessing and exchanging data on that network (such as a business  that chooses to participate in an industry or market-specific Blockchain).  Consensus protocol  The core difference between a distributed ledger and a traditional database is the way in which datasets  evolve over time. The system allows multiple participants to submit new inputs to a distributed ledger.  Consensus is then used to determine over time which state of the database is considered as valid. This is in  contrast to a traditional database, where multiple participants submit new inputs and one counterparty is  relied on to provide the valid state of the database.  Consensus protocols are the mechanisms by which all users within a distributed ledger agree on the  validity of the underlying data.  One of the key aspects of a distributed ledger is that the data held within it, is considered valid because all  parties agree to a single “true” version. In the event that existing participants in a Blockchain decide to  include data in a non-compliant manner with established protocols, an event named a fork occurs.  Forks result in a split of the ledger and the consequent creation of two groups, each validating their  own version of the ledger. In order for participants to be able to continue to interact with each other,  they are required to follow the same fork of the ledger.3  The following table gives a brief overview of main consensus protocols in use:  CONSENSUS PROTOCOL OVERVIEW  Proof of Work  Uses computational power to validate new blocks of data.  To participate in this scheme, participants are required to collate transactions within a  single block and then apply a hash function with the use of some additional metadata.  Proof of Stake  Validators (special nodes) voting on valid blocks whilst posting collateral in order to be able  to participate in the validation process.  Unlike Proof of Work, Proof of Stake relies on proving the user is invested in the underlying  token of value of the network being mined rather than being the owner of a large amount  of computing power  Ripple Protocol  In order to validate new transactions, servers amalgamate outstanding transactions into a  “candidate list.”  All participants then vote on valid transactions to be included in the ledger.  3 A case study of a fork can be found in Annex B of this document  Distributed Ledger Technology & Cybersecurity  Improving information security in the financial sector | December 2016  11  Transactions that meet the 80% threshold of “yes” votes are included within the following  last closed ledger state.  Proof of Elapsed Time  As part of its Intelledger proposal, Intel has devised a means of establishing a validation  lottery that takes advantage of the capability of its CPUs to produce a timestamp  cryptographically signed by the hardware.  Whoever in the chain has the next soonest timestamp will be the one to decide which  transactions will be a part of the next block in the chain.  This consensus method is extremely energy efficient compared to Proof of Work and  therefore more adapted to IoT devices.  Table 1: Consensus protocols  Cryptography  Distributed ledger technology relies on the use of asymmetric cryptography to sign messages and encrypt  data through the use of a private/public key pair. Key sizes depend on the implementation of the ledger  and could vary.  Cryptography is also involved in some of the consensus protocols (e.g. Proof of Work) and is the primary  vehicle in achieving consensus.  The private keys, which allow a given entity to transact with the assets or virtual currency allocated to it in  the Blockchain are typically stored in what is called a wallet. In a given wallet, there could be multiple keys  stored.  Sidechains  The standard operation of a distributed ledger might allow thousands of transactions which in some cases,  might result in slow processing. In an attempt to resolve this problem, one technology that has been  developed is the concept of side chains.   These are the concept of running a separate distributed ledger off of the main chain but with  transactions able to take place in the same currency as the core system   By performing transactions on a such specialized ledger, transactions should be processed faster   Users who are able to see the content of a transaction, may also be restricted depending on that  sidechain’s implementation  Another sidechain4 proposal establishes the idea of pegged sidechains. Pegged sidechains would enable  digital virtual currencies and/or other ledger assets to be transferred between multiple Blockchains.  Smart Contracts  Business activities require counterparties to trust each other, and ensure they share the same  understanding of transaction details. Contractual obligations carry three key characteristics, as outlined by  researcher Nick Szabo5.   Observability  The ability of the principals (parties to the contract) to observe each other’s performance of the  contract, or to prove their performance to other principals.  4 A. Back, M. Corallo, L. Dashjr, M. Friedenbach, G. Maxwell, A. Miller, A. Poelstra, J. Timon, P. Wuille, Enabling  Blockchain Innovations with Pegged Sidechains, 22nd October 2014  5 Nick Szabo, Formalizing and securing relationships on public networks, First Monday Vol. 2 Number 9 September  1997  http://pear.accc.uic.edu/ojs/index.php/fm/article/view/548/469 http://pear.accc.uic.edu/ojs/index.php/fm/article/view/548/469  Distributed Ledger Technology & Cybersecurity  Improving information security in the financial sector | December 2016  12   Verifiability  The ability of a participant in a contractual agreement to prove to an arbitrator that a contract has  been performed or breached, or the ability of the adjudicator to find this out by other means.   Privity  The principle that knowledge and control over the contents and performance of a contract should  be distributed among parties only as much as is necessary for the performance of that contract. A  generalization of the common law principle of contract privity, which states that third parties –  other than the designated adjudicators and designated intermediaries – should have no say in the  enforcement of a contract.  Blockchain-based applications involve the use of smart contracts, a direct application of Szabo’s principles.  Smart Contracts  “Contracts whose terms are recorded in a computer language instead of legal language. Smart contracts  can be automatically executed by a computing system, such as a suitable distributed ledger system.”6  Smart contracts allow participants to verify that counterparties have fulfilled their obligations and  provide for an accelerated, automated, settlement once the required conditions have been met (such as  a payment or asset transfer).  Permissionless Ledgers  A permissionless ledger is defined as a Blockchain protocol where a client may operate a full node without  prior approval (i.e. download a copy of the database and act as a validator for future transactions). The  advantage of a permissionless ledger is that, as it gains adoption, it becomes highly decentralised and  redundant, becoming very difficult to shut down.  Furthermore, applications deployed within a permissionless ledger will be able to natively interact with  other applications on the same ledger. If two applications are on separate ledgers, then a communication  channel becomes required.  Permissioned Ledgers  Permissioned ledgers are a form of distributed ledger that operate as a “members’ club”. In this  environment, the underlying consensus protocol is freely chosen by the group that initiates the protocol.  In the example of a group of financial institutions:   they would agree on a common distributed ledger protocol   Consensus protocols changes could potentially happen if adopted by all the counterparties   Its’ members will be able to vet and add new counterparties, as well as remove existing ones.  Though financial institutions may use permissionless chains to hash some private data as well as trade on  specific public, open, markets, the largest likelihood is that most applications and financial systems will be  implemented as permissioned ledgers, managed by a quorum of counterparties. A permissioned ledger  could allow financial institutions to leverage their real-world reputation. In this case, the FI will not want to  perform malicious actions on the network, as this will damage their brand.  6 UK Government Office for Science, p.18, Distributed Ledger Technology: beyond blockchain, 2016  Distributed Ledger Technology & Cybersecurity  Improving information security in the financial sector | December 2016  13  As outlined, distributed ledger technology offers a novel set of solutions to enable entities to transact with  others in a safer environment. However, the extent to which this is a security improvement will now be the  focus of our next section.  Distributed Ledger Technology & Cybersecurity  Improving information security in the financial sector | December 2016  14  4. Cybersecurity Challenges  In this section we aim to identify the challenges associated with the distributed ledger technology. As this  technology is in its development stage the challenges recognized should not be considered as complete list  of challenges.  The Traditional Challenges  The use of a distributed ledger implies that data is shared between all counterparties on the network. On  one side this could potentially have a negative impact on the confidentiality; while on the other, it has a  positive impact on availability with many nodes participating in the Blockchain, making it more robust and  resilient.  4.1.1 Key Management  Private keys are the direct means of authorizing activities from an account, which in the event they get  accessed by an adversary, will compromise any wallets or assets secured by these keys.  The methodology of the attacks seeking to gain unauthorised access to a system via stolen credentials  remains fundamentally the same- try to capture information, plant malware and/or use social engineering  to steal the private keys from the user’s machine.  Potentially different private keys could be used for signing and encrypting messages across the distributed  ledger. An attacker who obtained encryption keys to a dataset would be able to read the underlying data.  However, if the signing key is secured, they will not be able to modify the data or interact with that smart  contract (providing it has been appropriately designed).  The significance of protecting the private key is due to the fact that actions taking place on a hacker’s  machine, such as file decryption attempts or private key reproduction, are not subject to server imposed  query limits and are run without anyone else being able to notice.  Unlike with traditional systems, where before a server administrator was capable of tracking attempts to  break into a customer or user account, the malicious users can keep trying limitlessly to decrypt or try to  reproduce a private key out of encrypted data from a given ledger. With Blockchain, there is no way of  knowing this is happening until after the hacker has succeeded.  4.1.2 Cryptography  Most Blockchain implementations rely on the cryptographically generated public and private keys to  operate.  Main challenge associated with cryptography is that stringent policies and procedures must be followed  when managing keys, including people, processes and technology.  Usually, the user generates the private and public keys using software, such as the Blockchain client  software, or another available software. It has already been shown, that some programs are generating  keys that have been identified to be weak7. There are also documented8 attempts to spread intentionally  7 Coindesk, Open-Source Tool Identifies Weak Bitcoin Wallet Signatures, October 16th 2014  8 N. Heninger, How not to generate random numbers, May 13th 2015, University of Pennsylvania  Distributed Ledger Technology & Cybersecurity  Improving information security in the financial sector | December 2016  15  weakened random number generators, from which a limited range of possible values can be produced.  Keys generated through these limited random number generators could be more easily brute forced.  Quantum computing may also threaten the premise of asymmetric cryptography. Though it does not  represent an immediate threat, it should be certainly taken into consideration for a future-proof solution.  Popular security algorithms that are used for securing information through a complicated challenge (e.g.  RSA, ElGamal), may now be resolved in a shorter amounts of time through the use of quantum computing.  4.1.3 Privacy  Privacy is an additional issue that emerges from the use of Blockchain technology.  In a permissionless ledger, all counterparties are able to download the ledger, which implies that they  might be able to explore the entire history of transactions, including those to which they were not  members of. The “right to be forgotten” where information needs to be removed from a ledger is  challenging to implement. Usually, many counterparties have the data from the ledger, and it would be  difficult to prove that all data has been deleted.  The solution of Hyperledger for example, offers to solve this by offering a range of commercial privacy  services.  Additionally, there is a challenge with smart contracts being able to access the data in order to process  transactions. Since this is possible, there is possibility that a smart contract might be able to leak  information on what is being processed. In this way, privacy might be breached.  4.1.4 Code review  Whilst many skilled eyes may have reviewed the protocols, methods, and codebase of popular  implementations of distributed ledgers, it remains possible that unknown vulnerabilities exist.  The Distributed Ledger Specific Challenges  In addition to the traditional security concerns, Blockchain brings additional security challenges and attack  vectors. Some of these are unique to specific implementations, and others exist across all designs.  4.2.1 Consensus hijack  In decentralized, permissionless networks, where consensus is formed through majority, taking control of a  large enough portion of participating clients could allow an attacker to tamper the validation process.  In the case of Bitcoin, this is referred to as a “51% attack9” where the majority (defined as the proportion  of all hashing power in the network) is compromised or controlled by the same entity or a coalition of  dishonest counterparties. An attacker would be able to produce new blocks faster than the rest of the  network (in proportion to their computing power) leading participants to consider that chain as valid.  The extent of a 51% attack will allow an attacker to refuse to process certain transactions as well as to  re-use an asset which has already been spent.  There is possibility, that in a permissionless distributed ledger, the computational power required to hijack  the consensus might be cheap enough for a malicious attacker to buy (from a cloud provider for example).  This depends on the number of participants and the computational power required for such case. In  9 I. Eyal, E. Sirer, Majority is not Enough: Bitcoin Mining is not Vulnerable, November 1st 2013  Distributed Ledger Technology & Cybersecurity  Improving information security in the financial sector | December 2016  16  situations like this, even one participant might hold the possibility to validate transactions and direct the  flow of transactions in the ledger. This is contrary to the notion that, usually, in distributed ledgers one  participant doesn’t have enough resources to influence the consensus process.10  Another consequence of such an attack is in the perspective of adoption. Any chain coming under attack  might see an outflow of participants, leading to the question of which chain should be considered as the  “main” one to follow as well as potentially crippling the value of that chain.  Another challenge comes from consensus protocols that do not involve some way of penalty to the  participants. In this way for a malicious user would be easier to attack.  4.2.2 Sidechains  Whereas major Blockchains like Bitcoin and Ethereum have sufficient adoption to be protected by their  mining process against all but the most resourceful attackers, sidechains are more at risk due to their more  specialised focus. Where a user has no interest in tracking the data and maintaining the operation of a  sidechain, they will not contribute the relevant mining power to secure that chain.  Another vulnerability of sidechains consists in the gateway used to transfer assets and messages between  chains. In the case of a Bitcoin sidechain, a user will “lock” Bitcoins in an address on the main Bitcoin  Blockchain and then issue proxy tokens for these on the sidechain. If users can also later exchange  sidechain tokens for the original token, this mechanism is called a 2-way peg. They can then transact with  others on that sidechain. If the initial “locking” transaction is later considered invalid, then subsequent  proxy-token transactions would also be affected. Additionally, owners of proxy tokens that had been  affected would not be able to convert these back to the original asset via the pegging mechanism.  Fraudulent transactions or attacks on a sidechain do not affect the validity of data held on the parent  chain. However, in the event that a sidechain was to be put out of service, the parent chain might be  subjected to high stress levels as the sidechain users migrate their transaction volumes to the parent  chain.  4.2.3 Exploiting Permissioned Blockchains  In a regulated, permissioned network, where consensus might be implemented under the regulator’s  direction, any exploitation of the regulator’s capabilities would be even more and immediately severe. The  extent of the impact depends on the range of capabilities ascribed to the regulator within that specific  system.  All problems that had required hijacking of the majority consensus, a task that was a potentially  significant in undertaking, are now replaced by the hijacking of a single entity.  The challenges created by the above could be mitigated by implementing a fixed-time notice period prior  to regulator-issued major protocol updates being made effective. However, until the intrusion is detected,  malicious activity would still be possible within the scope of the regulator’s ongoing activities, such as  whitelisting individuals or institutions to participate in the system.  10 Eyal, Ittay, and Emin Gün Sirer. \"Majority is not enough: Bitcoin mining is vulnerable.\" International Conference on  Financial Cryptography and Data Security. Springer Berlin Heidelberg, 2014.  Distributed Ledger Technology & Cybersecurity  Improving information security in the financial sector | December 2016  17  4.2.4 Distributed Denial of Service  Distributed Denial of Service attacks coming out of the nature of the distribute ledger remain a concern.  For example, if rogue wallets decide to push large numbers of spam transactions to the network it could  create potentially a denial of service and increase the processing time, as the nodes will be checking the  validity of the fraudulent transactions.  In March 2016, the Bitcoin network was slowed to a near halt. The cause was a Bitcoin wallet pushing large  volumes of spam transactions with a higher than average transaction fee. This caused miners to prioritise  these transactions when computing new blocks.  Within a permissioned ledger, it would be possible for nodes to agree to ignore or even block the issuer of  such spam transactions. However, if an attacker is able to control a large number of clients, they might be  able to severely disrupt the network by pushing large volumes of irrelevant transactions.11  The distributed nature of Blockchain architecture introduces the prospect that it would be difficult to  shut down a malicious program.  With the capabilities of newer protocols offering data storage and computation, it would be possible to  store malicious data within the Blockchain network. Additionally, an attacker could reassign control of the  related smart contract at will, leveraging the trustless nature of the Blockchain to buy and sell malware  between anonymous cryptographic keys12.  4.2.5 Wallet Management  Wallet management represents the process and technology used with which a wallet software operates  with the keys assigned to it. The wallet software would need to protect the keys from being accessed  without authorization, in both cases while stored, but also while in operation with the software.  Losing access to a given wallet might preclude a financial institution from authorising transactions or  moving assets. It might be difficult for an entity to be aware that a malicious user has access to the wallet,  because copying or stealing the keys might not leave any trace on a computer. By the time an entity  understands that the keys are compromised, because of a fraudulent transaction for example, it might be  too late for reversal.  4.2.6 Scalability  Removing the need to reconcile counterparty data introduces a scalability problem. On one hand the  growth of the ledger size and on the other the speed at which transactions are processed.  The need to store all data pertaining to a specific distributed ledger, may grow to be unmanageable in  size for individual end-users.  In the case of a financial market implementation, we assume that major financial institutions act as full  nodes. Where the Bitcoin Blockchain has exceeded 90Gb, the Ethereum Blockchain exceeds 10Gb  (depending on client used). In terms of keeping a full copy of the database, this doesn’t look like a big  11 Lamport, Leslie, Robert Shostak, and Marshall Pease. \"The Byzantine generals problem.\" ACM Transactions on  Programming Languages and Systems (TOPLAS) 4.3 (1982): 382-401  12 D.

Garrett, A novel approach for computer worm control using decentralised data structures, December  13th 2014  Distributed Ledger Technology & Cybersecurity  Improving information security in the financial sector | December 2016  18  number, but its growth is exponential and has grown for four years around 450% (Bitcoin from July 2012 to  July 2016).  The speed at which a given transaction is processed, in some implementations of the ledger, may not be  sufficient or acceptable13.  Exposed to the high transaction volumes of financial institutions, a completely distributed ledger might  subject users to performance issues as their machines struggle to maintain an ever growing chain. The  transaction speed also depends on the consensus protocol. In the case of Proof of Work consensus  protocol the validation of transactions needs to be verified by a number of other nodes which requires  processing time. The more participants need to verify a transaction, the more time it will take to be  accepted as valid in the ledger. On one hand, participants might not have sufficiently powerful hardware to  validate a transaction. On the other, the ledger protocol itself would be designed to accommodate more  general requirements, thus bringing more delay. In a consensus protocol that would just use time  stamping, the process of validation will be faster compared to the Proof of Work.  The possibility that only specific transactions are to be verified by specific nodes (validators) is called  Sharding.14 Sharding could also introduce a significant fault (ie. reversion of subsequent transactions) if a  specific subset of validators were to wrongly validate transactions to which other members of that same  Blockchain refer to. This is due to the fact that communication between shards will require the use of  transaction receipts from one shard to communicate with the next.  The process of downloading block headers (which are a hashed version of past data) as well as the  underlying data for most recent blocks and then cross-reference this with other nodes (rather than  downloading the entire database) is called Blockchain pruning. Here, a challenge exists if an attacker were  to convince a user that the fraudulent block headers they verify, are genuine.  4.2.7 Smart Contract Management  Smart contract management refers to the people, processes and technology used when creating a smart  contract.  Smart contracts are essentially programs that run on the distributed ledger. They are prone to any faults  associated with code. As with any software, the more complex a smart contract is, the more prone to  software errors it will be.  Generally, the function, and the security of smart contracts code depends on the author’s capabilities.  A review by Peter Vessenes15 found that large numbers of template contracts available on the web for the  Ethereum scripting system contained significant vulnerabilities to their operation.  13 Note: For reference, at the time of writing the Bitcoin transactions are limited to 7(seven) per second, Visa handles  at an average of 2000 (two thousand) per second  14 V. Buterin, DEVCON1: Scalable Blockchains & Asynchronous Programming, Nov. 9th 2015  15 P. Vessenes, Ethereum Contracts are Going to be Candy for Hackers, May 18th 2016  http://vessenes.com/ethereum-contracts-are-going-to-be-candy-for-hackers/  Distributed Ledger Technology & Cybersecurity  Improving information security in the financial sector | December 2016  19  On June 2016 an attack on the DAO16 took place, which was an investment vehicle created on the  Ethereum network and operated as a smart contract. Over $59m in Ether17 were stolen by an unknown  source from the wallet controlled by the program on behalf of all investors.  4.2.8 Interoperability  Using different distributed ledgers will very likely bring the need of data sharing between them.  Exchanging data will require translation of formats and protocols, which currently are in very early  stages.  Also having to reconcile transactions between different distributed ledger brings another challenge to  consider, as different consensus protocols might not be easy to transpose from one to another. Key  challenges related to interoperability are:   Who can transfer assets between distributed ledgers?   Who can oppose to transferring assets?   Should transfers allow for whole asset or just part of it?   Should changes of ownership or asset (theft, loss) be also proliferated to the other chains?  Another interoperability challenge arises from the use of wallet software with different distributed ledgers.  Currently, most distributed ledgers come with their own wallet software, and it is difficult to have a  common wallet for different distributed ledgers.  4.2.9 Governance controls  Institutions still need their staff to sign off on requests and transactions, though a distributed ledger may  transparently indicate which financial institution was involved in a transaction. A challenge becomes how  exactly the governance structure could be coded into the distributed ledger.  Another aspect of governance lies at the systemic level, where some institutions may have rules  concerning which business activities they can engage in. For example, in the distributed ledger there might  be rules for some financial institutions to be allowed to transact with only specific entities, or provide only  specific services.  4.2.10 Anti-fraud and Anti-Money Laundering Tools  Another key problem is a lack of tools to combat illegal activity. Though it might be possible to identify  who owns an address used for money laundering despite attempts at obfuscating the transaction18, it is  not possible to block these types of transactions in advance. Also, the consensus-based nature of adoption  combined with the cross-application and industry aspirations of Blockchain technology means protocols  may not evolve sufficiently fast or in correlation with more complex business needs.  The European Commission has already begun researching the foundations of a Public Key Infrastructure,  that will impose Anti-Money Laundering (AML) compliance on all entities acting as gateways towards the  16 See annex B  17 Zerohedge, Bitcoin's Largest Competitor Hacked: Over $59 Million \"Ethers\" Stolen In Ongoing Attack, June 17th 2016  18 M.

Within the financial sector, this could give way to a whitelist of approved public  keys whose owners are institutions and professionals who have been allowed to transact.19  Another issue that arises with users is that the Blockchain network could be more trustworthy than the  machine used to access it. Hence, though the record of the transactions would be verifiable, the intent to  perform that transaction might not be. An example of this would consist in the transfer of a large sum of  money. Because it happens on a distributed ledger, the transaction is visible and verifiable by all other  entities on that ledger. However, the owner of the wallet may not have had the intent of making such a  transfer and been subject to a hack. The decentralised chain design also means that it is not possible to  simply revert previous actions.  A further potential vulnerability lies not just in the consensus protocol, which exists to provide an accurate  historical presentation, but in the transaction protocol used to broadcast messages to the rest of the  network. Fraudulent transactions exist in various types:   Double-spending: This involves sending two transactions, one of which will cancel the other. In the  example of Bitcoin, until the UTxO set of the Blockchain has been sufficiently confirmed after enough  time, counterparties expose themselves to the possibility that the payment received will be invalid.   Hacked key: This type of transaction is broadcast to the network but has not been conducted by the  true owner. This happens when a third party obtains unauthorised access to a key.   Non-compliant transaction: This type of transaction is mainly applicable to permissioned, regulated  networks. It involves broadcasting a message either from an unauthorised address or against pre- defined business rules. Hyperledger solves this issue with a blend of enrolment (authorisation)  certificates and single use transaction certificates to allow transactions.  19 European Commission, p.7 Proposal for amending Directive (EU) 2015/849 on the prevention of the use of the  financial system for the purposes of money laundering or terrorist financing, 2016  Distributed Ledger Technology & Cybersecurity  Improving information security in the financial sector | December 2016  21  5. Good Practices  Having identified key challenges related to Blockchain implementations, our recommendations focus on  the good practices to adopt within each category.

Distributed Ledger Technology & Cybersecurity  Improving information security in the financial sector | December 2016  25  Annex A: Blockchain Use Cases  Blockchain technology holds a significant promise for the financial sector. It simplifies many types of  business transaction and has significant applications within the non-financial sector.  A.1 Executing and settling contractual agreements  The current process behind an investment in shares requires for counterparties to hold both a bank  account and their shares with institutions that can assist with the settlement of their trade. In contrast, a  share trade accomplished through a distributed ledger can be settled instantly. Furthermore, as soon as a  user receives their share tokens, is able to receive dividends and vote on proposals from the originating  company. A share token is a digital version of a share certificate. However, rather than owning a paper  certificate specifying ownership of shares, a shareholder owns digital tokens, representing the equivalent  of shares. Due to the fact that smart contracts are legal contracts embedded in code, it therefore becomes  possible to assign the attached rights to various classes of shares to these tokens.  In the case of more complex financial instruments such as derivatives, it is possible to program the  execution of settlements following external events. Additionally, what were previously complex paper  contracts can now be encoded into software, allowing financial institutions to assign a data-based  framework to keep track of liabilities.  A.2 Reconciling and auditing information  Current processes require a financial institution to reconcile data internally then across business lines.  Using Blockchain technology, institutions can eliminate double-entry accounting by connecting Back-office  transaction processing to the initiator of a transaction. Furthermore, instead of preparing cyclical reports  and audits for regulators, it will be possible to communicate data in real-time, allowing for a more efficient  implementation of regulatory requirements and risk monitoring.  A.3 Signing messages on behalf of a counterparty  A good example of this is undertaking a proof of funds action. Whereas a client involved in import/export  financing would need to request a letter from their bank, they can now sign a message on the Blockchain  to prove they have the funds available. One way to do this is to simply transfer the funds to another wallet  which the user has access to. In advance of the transaction, and then inform the counterparty of the wallet  addresses to monitor. Other users on the Blockchain will only be able to identify that a transaction  between two anonymous public keys has happened. Furthermore, it is technically feasible to encrypt the  amount of a transaction, thus obscuring amounts to third parties.  A.4 Connecting systems to IoT enabled devices  Blockchain technology will facilitate the development of large amounts of connected devices. By enabling  their systems to interface with the data generated for these devices, financial institutions can obtain real-  Distributed Ledger Technology & Cybersecurity  Improving information security in the financial sector | December 2016  26  time data for a range of matters such as destructive weather (for insurers), client location (fraud  prevention), production facility status (valuation of a business).  A.5 Facilitating the transfer of assets  Registering and transferring the ownership of an asset can be a complex process involving multiple  information silos. In the case of a residential property, relevant surveys must be carried out and  intervention of a central counterparty, such as the Land Registry, is required in order to effectively record  the transfer of ownership. A distributed ledger may enable property titles to be freely exchanged and  linked to smart objects, such as an electronic lock that only opens for a specific key. Because the ledger is  timestamped, it would also be possible for an arbitrator to verify who made the first claim in the case two  counterparties were in dispute over a property. As soon as a property is transferred, this could also be  made visible to the property buyer’s bank, who would then be able to offer a variety of collateral-backed  financial products.  $  Bank A  $  Bank BBank A Ledger  Alice Bob  Bank B Ledger  $  Clearing House  $  Bank Correspondent A  $  Bank Correspondent B  Bank B Correspondent  Ledger  Bank A Correspondent  Ledger Clearing House Ledger  Distributed Ledger Technology & Cybersecurity  Improving information security in the financial sector | December 2016  27  $  Bank A  $  Bank B  Alice Bob  Same Copy  of the  Ledger  Same Copy  of the  Ledger  Smart  Contract  Same Copy  of the  Ledger  Same Copy  of the  Ledger  A.6 Automating regulatory compliance  Prudential regulation defines the capital requirements needed by financial institution to function  effectively. If all trades are happening on distributed ledgers with the information encrypted to transaction  counterparties and the regulator, it becomes possible to calculate in near real-time an institutions’  financial position and whether additional transactions will cause it to exceed the defined risk management  parameters and capital requirements. Another application from a regulatory perspective lies in enforcing  sanctions and closing access to specific markets if participants do not meet the criteria.  A.7 Portable Identity  Distributed ledgers have the advantage of using cryptography rather than user credentials. This means that  participants in a ledger can produce their own identity by generating a private key only they have access  to. The entity (individual or business) can then port its identity across different services as long as it uses  the same address.  A.8 Automated companies and investment vehicles  Smart contracts make it much easier to conduct corporate governance. This includes automating the  shareholder listing, recording board decisions and allocating assets. Financial institutions will be able to  Distributed Ledger Technology & Cybersecurity  Improving information security in the financial sector | December 2016  28  take advantage of smart contracts by quickly instantiating investment vehicles on a distributed ledger  whilst subjecting them to regulatory requirements. Because assets and funds can interact through a  Blockchain, smart contract-based investment vehicles will be able to accurately manage the holdings of a  business with full transparency.  Additionally, the issuance of new shares as well as trading of outstanding shares can be conducted through  the ledger. Financial institutions can choose to trade within existing liquidity pools. However, their  settlement can be linked to the Blockchain in order to improve the efficiency of trading activity.  Distributed Ledger Technology & Cybersecurity  Improving information security in the financial sector | December 2016  29  Annex B: A study of the Ethereum DAO hack  Ether is the currency of the Ethereum Blockchain, with the second highest capitalisation in the digital  currency market. Following its developer-focused Frontier release in July 2015, Ethereum released  Homestead, the first production-grade version of the protocol, in March 2016. Since inception, Ethereum  has been designed to allow for a range of applications rather than being limited to digital currency. A  private version of the Ethereum network has even been used22 by the R3 Consortium, a group of banks  conducting an evaluation of Blockchain technology.  A range23 of independently developed Decentralised Applications (DApps) are already in existence on the  Ethereum network. These range from identity record lookup and validation to Blockchain-chartered  companies, prediction markets and notary services. However, the main issue as with any new technology is  that of adoption. Within the world of decentralised ledgers, this can happen in two ways, either bottom-up  grassroots adoption or through the integration of Blockchain technology to the technology stacks of  existing commercial service providers. The first major demonstration of the potential of a decentralised  computer (Ethereum Virtual Machine) was the launch of the Decentralised Autonomous Organisation  (DAO)24. This smart-contract based investment vehicle is aimed at providing a collective fund through  which token holders can vote on investments and contractors to undertake specific ventures or tasks.  After a token sale (similar to IPO) in May 2016, the DAO raised over 11.5 Million Ether25 (equivalent to over  €140 million). This also represented over 13% of all Ether in existence at the time. On June 17th 2016, the  DAO came under an attack known as a “recursive split.”26 Investors in a DAO can choose to separate from  the existing vehicle and take their funds with them. In this case, a split function occurred, initiating a  withdrawal. However, the function was called recursively, blocking the invocation of the function which  updates the user’s token balance, and therefore allowing them to withdraw more funds than they were  otherwise entitled to.  In response, a protocol update27 was proposed within the same month and adopted28 on July 20th. This  protocol reverted the previous transactions to an address accessible by the original DAO investors,  enabling them to withdraw their funds. Within a day, nearly half the original investors had been able to  recover their Ether.  The DAO hack is an example of how participants in a distributed ledger can, by consensus, overcome major  security events. However, this also introduces the possibility of reverting past transactions, an issue which  would mean that participants who transacted after the attack would have their transactions effectively  nullified. This has resulted in a hard fork and the creation of a second Blockchain, “Ethereum Classic” which  does not recognise the reversion of the attack as valid.  22 Coindesk, Ethereum Blockchain Project Launches First Production Release, March 14th 2016  23 Ethereum DApps  24 DAOHub  25 New York Times, A Hacking of More Than $50 Million Dashes Hopes in the World of Virtual Currency, June 17th 2016  26 Hacking Distributed, Analysis of the DAO exploit, June 18th 2016  27 Ethereum Blog, CRITICAL UPDATE Re: DAO Vulnerability, June 17th 2016  28 Coindesk, Ethereum Executes Blockchain Hard Fork to Return DAO Funds, July 20th 2016  Distributed Ledger Technology & Cybersecurity  Improving information security in the financial sector | December 2016  30  Annex C: Distributed Ledgers  Bitcoin  The main cryptocurrency by market capitalisation and the most widely known implementation of the  Blockchain concept, Bitcoin has operated without any central authority since 2009. There are now over  15m bitcoins in existence, with a market capitalisation of close to 8Bn Euros.  Bitcoin contains a very basic scripting language, called Script, making simple smart contracts a possibility.  Script does not support loops and acts mainly as a tool to place parameters on how Bitcoins can be spent  once they arrive at their destination.  Bitcoin uses a distributed ledger of transactions from which it is possible to compute the Unspent  Transaction Output set, or UTxO. From a more practical perspective, this means that wallets’ publicly  exposed addresses (ie. unique identifiers) are not simply links to a set amount or asset. Rather, they are  the most recent link in a publicly verifiable historical trail of transactions which ends at that address.  Open networks such as Bitcoin need to allow for an unbounded number of participants. The challenge that  therefore arises is for a large number of parties who do not know each other and may not trust each other  to arrive at an agreement about the truth of a given transaction. Bitcoin solves this problem with the use  of a proof of work algorithm. In order for messages to be considered valid, they must be compressed into a  block of data, which is appended to the existing database. This concept of validating a set of messages is  referred to as mining.  The economic connotation of the term of mining refers to the fact that in the Bitcoin implementation,  peers are given an incentive to maintain the system. Each new block in the Blockchain is the result of a  competition by miners to provide a valid set of transactions in a block. Miners that successfully submit the  next block receive a reward, denominated in the crypto-token linked to that specific Blockchain. For  example, every 10 minutes on average, one of the miners on the Bitcoin Blockchain currently receives 12.5  Bitcoin (approx. 6 700 Euros29) for solving the current block.  For the system to function, peers must be able to ascertain that the information they have been presented  with is truthful. Additionally, there should be a disincentive for dishonest actors to overtake the system.  The proof of work function makes it unlikely for 2 parties to arrive at a valid conclusion to the challenge at  the same time. However, it remains a possibility. When this happens, a fork may develop in the Blockchain  with two separate chains proceeding. To stop these forks from continuing, and to ensure there is only ever  one chain, clients accept the longest chain above all others. As a result, the two chains at the fork enter a  race condition to see who can become the longest first, with the smaller one being discarded.  The issue that arises with a distributed ledger is guaranteeing that, as the dataset evolves over time, older  data is not subject to modification. To avoid this, all previous blocks in the system are included in the hash  for the most recent block. This is referred to as a Merkle proof3031. The Bitcoin implementation features a  chain of blocks. Each block contains a block header with 6 elements:  29 Based on an XBT/EUR rate of € 533.92 on Aug. 8th 2016  30 US Patent No 4309569, Filed September 1979  31 Ethereum Blog, Merkling in Ethereum, November 15th 2015  Distributed Ledger Technology & Cybersecurity  Improving information security in the financial sector | December 2016  31   Block version - Specifies the version of the Blockchain the mining software is generating for.   Hash of previous block header - A hashed version of the previous block header.   Hash of Merkle Root (Transactions in Block) - A hash of all transactions/messages in the current block.   Timestamp - The time of publication of the block.   Bits - A 256 bit number that acts as a target for miners to produce a hash under the value of in order to  generate a valid block.   Nonce - A random number to allow for different hash outputs for a block on each attempt.  In order to produce a block, miners pick a set of transactions to validate and hash them using a SHA-256  algorithm. If the resulting hash is a lower number than the Bits, then it is considered a valid solution and is  broadcast to the rest of the network. If it isn’t, the nonce is changed for each hashing run until an output  lower than the Bits is found.  The algorithm used for proof of work requires the entity running the computation to contribute  computational power. The probability of submitting the valid solution to a block is proportional to the total  amount of computing power contributed by that user during the time window necessary to find the most  recent valid block. The proof of work algorithm has enabled Bitcoin to operate for over 7 years. However,  one of its main flaws resides in the fact that it consumes a large amount of energy. The first unintended  consequence is that this creates a drive towards centralisation of mining capacity due to economies of  scale to be achieved on hardware and electricity. Additionally, based on current projections, Bitcoin may  consume as much electricity as Denmark by 202032. As such, research for other needed solutions has  resulted in alternative proposals that can lower electricity consumption without impacting data security.  Ethereum  Ethereum was founded in 2013 and launched in 2015 after a successful crowdfunding campaign which  raised over $18m in Bitcoin. To date there are over 80m Ether in circulation, with a market capitalisation  approaching 1Bn Euros.  Ethereum offers the same range of computational abilities as existing real-world systems, and in particular  supporting loops and conditional statements. The inherent design of the system means that smart contract  code and its’ execution are open for review by all parties. Ether is a form of payment made by the clients  of the platform to the machines executing the requested operations.  A variety of languages have been developed to support smart contracts. Ethereum's virtual machine runs  on byte code, which can now be compiled out of many traditional languages including Javascript and C++.  Solidity is a new High Level Language developed specifically for Ethereum contracts, similar to Javascript,  designed to make complex smart contracts as easy to write as possible.  Whereas Bitcoin blocks contain transaction messages, Ethereum blocks contain messages representing  computational steps of the execution of a smart contract. This computation is funded by subunits of Ether,  more commonly referred to as “gas”. All execution fees are paid by the entity issuing the instruction and  are included within the mining rewards for that specific block. Blocks on the Ethereum chain are currently  also validated using a proof of work algorithm; however, it is in the process of switching to Proof of Stake.  32 Breitbart, Bitcoin may consume as much electricity as Denmark by 2020, April 3rd 2016  http://www.breitbart.com/tech/2016/04/03/bitcoin-could-consume-as-much-energy-as-denmark-by-2020/  Distributed Ledger Technology & Cybersecurity  Improving information security in the financial sector | December 2016  32  Ripple  Already in use by a number of financial institutions, Ripple33 provides a Peer to Peer system for banks in  foreign exchange (FX) markets to transact with each other. The global ledger is replicated by thousands of  participants. FX trades take place through a distributed order book, where all bids and asks are recorded  and executed. Ripple relies on the concept of “gateways”. Hence, in order for a user to move their fiat (i.e.  account balances denominated in government-issued currencies such as EUR, GBP etc) balance out of the  Ripple network, they will need to request a settlement from the entity that initially issued that balance on  the network. Therefore, Ripple still contains a degree of counterparty risk as users are required to trust  that they will be able to receive an effective settlement of their funds.  Hyperledger  The wide variety of applications for distributed ledger technology also means there is a large amount of  potential optimization to be done, as some protocols may be more appropriate in certain circumstances  depending on who is building them and for what. Recognition of this has led to the development of  Hyperledger, which is being developed by a consortium of finance and technology companies, led by the  Linux Foundation. Hyperledger34 is focused on developing a standard for distributed ledgers that will  allow separate ledgers to communicate with one another without needing bespoke APIs. From a security  perspective, Hyperledger uses two types of certificate:   Enrolment certificates: Controls a participants’ access to the network   Single use Transaction Certificates: Restricts the ability to push undesirable transactions  Hyperledger refers to this common standard as Fabric, and intends for smart contracts to be writeable on  this platform in any common programming language. The aim is to produce a completely modular system  that will allow everything – from the cryptography used to the underlying consensus protocol – to be easily  customized and deployed with as little effort as possible. The key driver of Hyperledger’s modular  approach is to allow business participants to determine the consensus protocol to use, following their  business needs.  Sawtooth Lake/Intelledger  Sawtooth Lake35 is an open source project developed by Intel, who are also participating in the  Hyperledger initiative. Founded on the same principles as Hyperledger, but with a slightly different focus,  its’ primary goal is to operate on IoT devices with limited human involvement.  Sawtooth Lake abstracts the core concept of consensus by isolating consensus from transaction semantics.  It provides two consensus protocols with different performance trade-offs; Proof of Elapsed Time and  Quorum voting, an adaptation of the Ripple protocol.  This project is currently in early development, with an alpha release simulating the token generation  function of the segregated secure CPU unit without the actual underlying hardware. However, some key  questions remain about this system, including Intel’s access and knowledge of the cryptographic keys on  the hardware. Additionally, it is not clear whether or not it is possible for a hacker to extract the keys to  33 Ripple, Executive Summary for financial institutions  34 Hyperledger Foundation  35 Intelledger developer documentation  Distributed Ledger Technology & Cybersecurity  Improving information security in the financial sector | December 2016  33  create timestamps that will assure them victory in the consensus determining lottery by decapping the  chips. Another question that remains is whether or not the range of hardware that will work in this system  can be expanded without being vendor-locked.  Corda  Corda is a distributed ledger for contracts tailored for use by financial institutions. It rethinks a number of  the assumed required components of their design. Transactions/agreements, are only visible to parties  with a need to see them, including a definable regulator. In this setting, the regulator could be an authority  such as the European Banking Authority or an industry body defining a set of standards market participants  are required to adhere to. Corda36 has no cryptocurrency, as these parties alone are also the validators of  the agreement taking place, with multiple consensus mechanisms potentially being used.  Corda aims to provide a global distributed ledger, where transactions serve as authoritative and binding  facts to ascribe contractual obligations to counterparties37. To this effect the behaviour of the system is  designed in code and backed by a legal framework which outlines the obligations of participants. Corda is  designed to allow a number of financial transactions, including enabling financial institutions to issue  digital fiat currency to counterparties. In turn, these Blockchain-based funds can be used for trading and  settlement.  36 R3 Blog, Introducing R3 Corda a distributed ledger designed for financial services, April 5th 2016  37 R. G.

A  DAO serves as a proxy to represent a real-world entity or grouping of entities.  Proof of Elapsed Time  As part of its Intelledger proposal, Intel has devised a means of establishing a validation lottery that takes  advantage of the capability of its CPUs to produce a timestamp cryptographically signed by the hardware.  Whoever in the ecosystem has the next soonest timestamp will be the one to decide which transactions  will be a part of the next block in the chain. This consensus method is extremely energy efficient compared  to Proof of Work and therefore more adapted to IoT devices. Proof of Elapsed time does not require a  Public Key Infrastructure. Assets with compatible hardware can simply be added to the network and  immediately participate in the validation process.  Ripple Protocol  The Ripple consensus protocol operates a ledger system. The last closed ledger is the most recent ledger  validated by the consensus process and can be accepted as representing the current state of the database.  In order to validate new transactions, servers amalgamate outstanding transactions into a “candidate list.”  All participants then vote on valid transactions to be included in the ledger. Transactions that meet the  80% threshold of “yes” votes are included within the following last closed ledger state.  Proof of Work  Proof of Work uses computational power to validate new blocks of data. To participate in this scheme,  participants are required to collate transactions within a single block and then apply a hash function with  the use of some additional metadata. If the resulting hash falls within the acceptable range set by the  current difficulty parameters of the proof of work scheme, then that block is considered valid and is  broadcast to the rest of the network as a valid submission. The probability of creating a valid block for any  individual miner is defined by the proportion of computing power held by that miner in comparison with  the rest of the network.  Proof of Stake  This consensus protocol is based on the validators voting on valid blocks whilst posting collateral in order  to be able to participate in the validation process. Unlike Proof of Work, Proof of Stake relies on proving  the user is invested in the underlying token of value of the network being mined rather than being the  owner of a large amount of computing power. Ethereum will use the Casper protocol variant. This  implementation of Proof of Stake sees all validators on the network undergo an iterative voting process on  the next valid block. Votes are made in the form of cryptocurrency, which is locked as a deposit until  consensus has been reached. The next valid block is the one which has the majority of deposits (at least  51%) allocated to it. Due to the iterative voting process, a validator that suddenly switches their vote to a  completely different block may forfeit their deposit. Proof of Stake additionally allows miners to focus  computing resources on processing more transactions per second rather than producing a large number of  hashes as in Proof of Work.  Quantum Computing  Quantum Computing is a new computing paradigm. It involves the use of quantum based phenomena. One  of the main benefits is opening the way for even smaller computers. This is especially relevant due to  Distributed Ledger Technology & Cybersecurity  Improving information security in the financial sector | December 2016  35  quantum tunnelling, an issue which arises for chips below 10nm as electrons begin to jump across closed  transistor gates. Quantum computers use “qubits” instead of conventional bits of information. These  qubits may take the form of an electron trapped inside a cage of atoms or the polarisation of laser light.  Other forms of quantum computers involve using molecules and observing their spin in order to  reconstruct information. Although quantum computers may potentially offer exponential computing  capabilities for specific tasks (such as brute-forcing attacks), they are still highly experimental.  Reconciliation  Reconciliation is the process by which individuals, companies and institutions must ensure all records are  valid and all instructions effectively executed. Reconciliation firstly involves ensuring all the internal data of  an organisation has been correctly captured and is in line with existing policies and rules. The second  element involves ensuring that, where data is shared with external counterparties, both parties hold the  same copy of that information. Blockchain technology promises for a large simplification of the  reconciliation process as data will be shared at the point of origin.  Double Spend  Double-spending is the result of successfully spending some money or an asset more than once. Double  spend attacks can mainly occur when the network has not yet processed a previous transaction from an  address.  Unspent Transaction Output Set (UTxO)  One of the key elements of a Blockchain is that data is considered valid in reference to previous data.  Hence, in the example of Bitcoin, the UTxO is the list of all current Bitcoin addresses which have previously  received funds and have not yet been spent. Each address can be linked to all the previous transactions  that resulted in the funds being routed to that address.

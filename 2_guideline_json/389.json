Executive Summary  Last year’s joint communication to the European Parliament and the Council for the building up of  cybersecurity for the EU included a call to Member States (MS) to make cyber-awareness a priority in  awareness campaigns.  The communication from the European Commission went on to explicitly mention  the Cybersecurity month (ECSM) and how it should be scaled up to achieve a greater reach as a common  communication effort at EU and national level.  This sets the scene for the 2018 campaign, the first campaign post the announcement. Indeed the 2018  European Cyber Security Month saw a step up by the MS in their engagement in the campaign.  The  number of MS taking an active role increased, however more importantly the collaboration of the MS in  the planning and execution phases ensured that the sixth campaign continued to outperform previous  years as measured by year on year results.  Highlights of 2018 campaign results:   Number of activities increased by 6.5% from 532 to 567   Number of twitter followers increased by 28% from 12894 to 16500   Online reach increased by 4.6% from 86.5m to 90.5m   Number of publications mentioning ECSM increased by 400% from 330 to 1655  The 2018 campaign was supported the European Commission, Europol’s Cyber Crime Centre (EC3),  European Schoolnet, SaferInternet4EU campaign and cyber security organisations from the Member  States.  Just as in previous years the concept for the European Cyber Security Month is to address disparity of  cybersecurity practices across member States in two stages. The first stage is to support the Member  States so that the awareness and behaviour of citizens in each Member State is raised to a mature level.  This becomes the reference baseline across the whole of Europe and thereby the European Cyber Security  Month aligns the risk levels across Europe. The second stage is to further lower this risk by raising the  maturity of citizen’s behaviour in unison; at the European level. ENISA and the European Commission can  achieve the objectives of the European Cyber Security Month by driving the pan-European campaign so as  to ensure all Member States are actively committed to the European Cyber Security Month and that  industry is also involved at all levels of the campaign both at the local and European level.  This report provides an overview of the activities organised and presents a synthesis of findings on the  basis of evaluation and performance information gathered via a questionnaire and media monitoring data.  The report is structured into three main parts: an introduction, the implementation phase and an  evaluation of the campaign.  The introduction will provide readers with the policy context, scope and target audience of the campaign.  The implementation phase of the report highlights the milestones that were achieved during the planning  and execution phase of the campaign.  This includes how events were organized and co-ordinated with  partners, marketing materials used and insights into the execution of the campaign including results.  The final section of the report deals with the evaluation of the campaign, comparing this year’s results with  the previous years. This year being the first year that the evaluation metrics developed in 2017 could be  ECSM 2018 Deployment Report  January 2019  06  assessed using the previous year’s base data.  Although the evaluation metrics provided some insights into  the evolution of the campaign at the MS level year on year, comparable results will only be comprehensive  and robust once all Member States are providing evaluation metrics year on year. The report concludes  with a conclusion and re-visits the future work described in the 2017 report.  Finally the report is intended to provide a basis for discussion among the Member States, the European  Commission and ENISA on how the ECSM can best be organised in the years to come. All Member States  will need to face up to similar challenges, namely how to engage citizens and organizations so as to affect  their information security behaviour.  ECSM 2018 Deployment Report  January 2019  07  2. Introduction  With some 95 % of incidents said to be enabled by \"some type of human error – intentional or not\",  there  is a strong human factor at play, making cybersecurity everyone's responsibility. This means personal,  corporate and public administration behaviour must change to ensure everybody understands the threat,  and is equipped with the tools and skills necessary to quickly detect and actively protect themselves  against attacks. People need to develop cyber hygiene habits and businesses and organisations must adopt  appropriate risk-based cybersecurity programmes and update them regularly to reflect the evolving risk  landscape.  The European Cyber Security Month (ECSM) under the coordination of ENISA is one of the mechanisms by  which cyber hygiene and awareness is promoted to the citizens of Europe.  ECSM runs for the entire month of October, with ENISA publishing new material and focusing on a  different topic each week. Along with ENISA, various stakeholders, including the private sector, academia,  the European Commission (EC) and other EU bodies, join together in a common vision by organising  activities with special focus on training, conferences, online quizzes and provide general presentations to  end users toward the establishment of an EU cyber-security culture.  This report summarises the activities carried out by ENISA and the participating MS for the 2018 campaign  and presents the evaluation and conclusions of the campaign. More importantly, it seeks to trigger a  discussion among partners with respect to improvements that can be made in the future.  Scope and Objectives  The scope of this report includes all the activities within the European Cyber Security Month (ECSM)  campaign and their impact in 2018.  The main objectives of the campaigns within ECSM 2018 were as follows:   to generate general awareness about Network and Information Security;   to educate and enhance awareness of information security and privacy;   to promote safer use of the internet for all users and the practice of basic cyber hygiene;   to stimulate awareness of cyberscams;   to build a strong track record to raise awareness through the ECSM;   to involve relevant stakeholders and increase the participation of EU Member States;   to increase national media interest through the European and international dimension of the project;   to enhance attention and interest with regard to information security through political and media  coordination.  Evaluation Methodology  In 2017, ENISA developed an evaluation strategy to guide the Agency and MS with the gathering of data  and information for the evaluation of the campaign. The same evaluation strategy was employed in 2018.  The Member State coordinators were urged to consider and define the evaluation metrics during the  planning stage of the campaign, so that the right data and information would be collected during the  execution stage.  The evaluation strategy includes both quantitative and qualitative approaches from the following sources:  ECSM 2018 Deployment Report  January 2019  08   collection of quantitative data from the MS campaign coordinators,   feedback from the MS campaign coordinators via the end of year Q&A questionnaire, and   the use of media monitoring services to gather analytical data.  An evaluation data collection form was developed by ENISA in collaboration with the Member State  coordinators for the purpose of information gathering. The evaluation form aims at extracting pertinent  information on the overall activities involved in the MS campaigns, their potential impact and includes  participants’ feedback. The evaluation form was distributed to the Member State Coordinators in the form  of an online survey, using the respective European Union platform EUSurvey  (https://ec.europa.eu/eusurvey/), and ENISA requested the Coordinators to complete it depending on  their national campaign strategy and execution. Guidelines accompanied the data collection form, that  highlight recommended metics for each type of activity.  The evaluation strategy also included a questionnaire, where the aim was to extract information on the  overall impact of the campaign based on MS campaign coordinators feedback with respect to ENISA’s  supportive role. Some of the elements assessed involve the level of support and its usefulness to MS, the  impact of promotion material used and marketing strategies followed and the role of ECSM for improving  the the outreach of MS campaigns.  Target Audience  This report is intended for organisations, either public or private, which supported the ECSM or intend to  do so in the future. The report is also of interest to IT security professionals and other target groups who  attended events and conferences organised across Europe. Further, the report targets EU national policy  makers who aim to improve the security awareness of citizens, professionals and generally IT end-users.  ECSM 2018 Deployment Report  January 2019  09  3. Planning Phase  The role of ENISA in ECSM 2018  3.1.1 Vision statement  ENISA supports the Member States with the design and implementation of their awareness raising  campaigns and to promote collaboration among EU Member States, international organizations and  industry.  3.1.2 Mission statement  ENISA’s mission for ECSM is to collaborate with the EU Member States and international organizations by  finding innovative and fun ways to raise EU citizens awareness of cybersecurity, be they by organizing  events, conferences, online quizzes, transferring of best practices or the use social media to educate and  inform the public. Our mission is to enhance the delivery and synchronize ECSM among the EU Member  States and industry that will share a pan-European vision and values for cybersecurity.  3.1.3 The Objectives for ECSM 2018  A consensus on the goals of ENISA for ECSM was reached with the participating MS. The goals that were  recognized by all MS for the Agency are as follows:   To promote the underlying value that is the foundation of ECSM:  “Cyber Security is a Shared Responsibility”   To assist the Member States in implementing ECSM activities that satisfy certain criteria: have well- defined objectives, have well-specified target audience(s) per activity, have systematically defined  cybersecurity subjects, have systematically chosen delivery channels and techniques and have well- defined effectiveness metrics   To support the Member States in defining common areas of concern for cybersecurity that are shared  and will be commonly promoted to EU citizens   To support the Member States in delivering at least one cross-border awareness raising activity among  at least three EU Member States   To support the Member States with collaboration with the private sector  ENISA supported the organisation of the European Cyber Security Month campaign in various ways, such  as:   coordinator of the organisation of ECSM;   hub for all participating MS;   collector of available material and generator of synergies between MS;   subject-matter expert on how to organise information security campaigns;   subject-matter expert on how to design the content and evaluation strategy for information security  campaigns;   facilitator of common messaging within the participating MS by providing tips and advice on how to be  safe and secure online;   creator of the ECSM brand and related marketing plan;   distributor of promotional material (infographics).  ECSM 2018 Deployment Report  January 2019  10  The Agency coordinated the organisation of the ECSM campaign, by acting as a “hub” for all participating  MS and providing suggestions, replying to enquiries and generating synergies between MS where possible.  The Agency assisted the participating MS in defining evaluation methods and metrics during the planning  phase, in order to ensure the alignment of campaign targets and evaluation approaches.  Coordination  3.2.1 Conference Calls and Meetings  ENISA maintained regular communication with the MS, in order to enhance collaboration and cooperation  amongst the MS. The Agency scheduled monthly conference calls for the MS to share their plans, receive  and provide feedback and to support in the common promotion of the pan-European campaign strategy.  The Agency prepared and distributed the meeting agenda before each conference call. Meeting minutes  where drawn up by ENISA after every call, and included a list of action points. The participation rate was  high, with an average of 12 to 15 participates per meeting.  A physical meeting was organized by ENISA and held in Brussels in February 2018. The meeting gave MS  the opportunity to discuss concerns and opportunities for improvements and finalize key areas of the  campaign, such as the themes of the month, the collaboration infrastructure and the organization and  decide on activities for the month.  3.2.2 Communication and Collaboration Technological Infrastructure  The collaboration mechanisms used for communication with MS is crucial for planning and executing the  campaign. ENISA provided three types of software tools for maintaining communication:   file repository and file exchange tools,   teleconference software and   tools for the communication and collaboration between Member State coordinators and third parties  (e.g., the private sector)  3.2.2.1 File repository and File Exchange Tools  ENISA has been utilizing Sharepoint for accessing and storing files. The file repository facilitated the work  of the MS that was previously supported with the exchange of files via email.  Some MS however cannot  access SharePoint due to security constraints.  3.2.2.2 Teleconference Software  Monthly conference calls were executed during the year in order to maintain regular contact with the MS.  The selection of the teleconference software was noted as an important decision, given that there were a  number of network and application restrictions on the side of the MS. In particular, certain tools (i.e.,  business versions, consumer versions) could not be utilised because they were restricted on the premises  or the equipment of the coordinators’ public agencies.  3.2.3 Themes of the Month  ENISA organized a workshop on Feb 2018 in Brussels and invited the Member State coordinators to  participate. The MS coordinators discussed and agreed upon the benefits of designing the MS campaigns  around commonly agreed security and privacy themes. ENISA suggested during the workshop potential  security themes and the MS discussed and debated on the most relevant and current topics based on MS  cybersecurity priorities and the state of the art challenges. Following this discussion process, the MS  gradually narrowed down the alternatives and determined four themes for the month, one theme for each  one of the weeks in October.  ECSM 2018 Deployment Report  January 2019  11  The four themes chosen:   Week 1 – Theme 1: Practice basic cyber hygiene   Week 2 – Theme 2: Expand your Digital Skills and Education   Week 3 – Theme 3: Recognize Cyberscams   Week 4 – Theme 4: Emerging Technologies and Privacy  3.2.4 Press Releases  ENISA, with the input of the European Commission, drafted a press release for the official launch of the  campaign.  The press release included an overview of the campaign and quotes from senior officials. The  press releases are translated into all the official languages of the EU and distributed to the Member State  coordinators to support their formal press release announcements.  3.2.5 Kick-Off Video  During the ECSM workshop in Brussels the decision was made to release a kick-off video rather than  organize a physical kick-off event. The MS & EFTA countries that participated in the kick-off video were  France, Finland, Germany, Luxembourg, Norway, Malta and Poland.  The video also included a message  from Mariya Gabriel EU Commissioner for Digital Economy and Society.  The process for developing the video was organized into stages.   ENISA proposed a script   MS commented on the script proposal and made necessary changes   Conference call was arranged with participating MS to finalize script   Guidelines were produced by ENISA to standardized the clips from the MS   MS chose the interviewee and formatted the prose based on the agreed upon script   Final clips including name, title and translation were sent to ENISA to compile   The clips were compiled to produce a single coherent set of messages and call to action   A teaser video was produced and released a few days before the official release of the kick-off video   The release of the official kick-off video coincided with the launch of the campaign  Evaluation Strategy  3.3.1 Evaluation Objectives  The Agency aimed to ensure that all Member State coordinators would capture information during the  execution of the awareness campaigns to enable the overall evaluation of ECSM and its impact. The  objective of the evaluation was to assess the effectiveness of the awareness activities, the attractiveness  of the activity, and its potential outreach and impact. The Agency urged the Member State Coordinators to  determine the evaluation metrics they would be using at the planning stage to ensure that they collected  the necessary data come the execution stage.  3.3.2 Evaluation Metrics  The Agency developed an evaluation strategy and a set of evaluation metrics for the Member State  Coordinators to use. The evaluation metrics were incorporated into a template evaluation form, for each  coordinator to complete upon finalisation of the execution stage. The evaluation metrics were segregated  per activity type, given that different information is relevant depending on the type of awareness  campaign.  ECSM 2018 Deployment Report  January 2019  12  Marketing Material  Both the Agency and the Member States were committed to raising awareness. A series of marketing  channels and material were used to achieve this purpose, as presented below.  3.4.1 Visual identity  The Agency created some years ago a visual identity for European Cyber Security Month including a logo1,  a colour chart, typography rules, guidelines on use of imagery, design templates and a manual of formal  guidelines on the proper use of these elements.  3.4.2 Slogan  The slogan “Cyber security is a shared responsibility!” remained unchanged in 2018.  3.4.3 Press releases  The Agency coordinated this year’s Press Release2 with the European Commission, to ensure maximum  outreach and to stimulate attention to the featured activities and events. The Press Release was translated  into all official languages of the European Union and was released on the 28th September. The services of a  media company were procured to further disseminate the press release to national and region journalists  and press across Europe.  3.4.4 Social media - banners  The Web and Social Media banners remained the  same as in the previous years.  The banner was available in four formats to match  different needs (i.e., 815x315, 1500x500, 1200x717,  1200x630).  3.4.5 Poster and Infographics  During the physical meeting in Feb in Brussels the MS discussed the different marketing options and their  impact. As a result of this discussion the MS decided not to produce posters for this year, but instead to  allocate the relevant resources for the production of a kick-off video, because of its perceived higher  impact and reach.  3.4.6 Kick-off video  A short kick-off video was produced with the support of a number of MS.  The video included a general  introduction to the campaign, core messages and a call to action.  3.4.7 Learning modules  Learning modules were created for each of the four topics for week two “Get Cyber Skilled”.  For each of  the four topics a guide was created with instructions and tips for the particular topics.  Topics:  1 https://cybersecuritymonth.eu/press-campaign-toolbox/visual-identity  2 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/news/enisa-news/cybersecurity-is-a-shared-responsibility-2018-european-cyber- security-month-kicks-off  Figure 1: ECSM 2018 social media banner.  ECSM 2018 Deployment Report  January 2019  13   Password management   Backing up data   Privacy settings   Protecting against social engineering  3.4.8 Toolkit for learning modules  A toolkit for week two was developed for the purpose of promoting the modules produced for week two  campaign “Get Cyber Skilled”. This included a long and short copy, quotes from senior officials, core  messages and cybersecurity tips.  3.4.9 Website  The material on the ECSM website3 was re-organized including the tabs on the home page so as to  enhance the accessibility of the website.  During week 2 for the theme Get Cyber Skilled the landing page was altered to promote the theme during  the month as the graphic below demonstrates.  3.4.10 NIS Quiz  The NIS Quiz was not updated in 2018. It was decided at the ECSM meeting in February that the NIS Quiz  would not be enhanced in favour for other activities.

Execution phase  Kick-off video  A teaser of the kick-off video4 was released some days before the official launch of the campaign.  This  included clips from the commissioner and a call to action to take part in cybersecurity activities.  On Friday 28th September the ECSM video5 was released with the official press release of the campaign.  The video included clips from the following:   European Commission Mariya Gabriel|Commissioner Communications Networks, Content and  Technology Informatics   Finland Jarkko Saarimäki | Director of the National Cyber Security Centre at the Finnish  Communications Regulatory Authority (FICORA)   France Mounir Mahjoubi | Secretary of State for Digital Affairs   Germany Arne Schönbohm | President of the German Federal Office for Information Security   Luxembourg Francine Closener | Secretary of State of the Economy   Malta Hon. Silvio Schembri | Secretary for Financial Services, Digital Economy and Innovation   Norway Peggy Sandbekken Heie | CEO of Norwegian Centre for Information Security   Poland Krzysztof Silicki | Director for Cybersecurity Capability Development and Cooperation  The event video has attracted over 1500 viewers since going live on the ENISA video channel on YouTube.  Themes of the month  Overview of the themes for 2018:  Week 1 – Theme 1: Practice basic cyber hygiene  ENISA and APWG designed a phishing poster for the first week of the campaign. The phishing poster  provided information about the scale of the phishing problem by numbers, tips on how to avoid phishing  and what to do if one becomes a victim of phishing.  Week 2 – Theme 2: Expand your Digital Skills and Education  The Get Cyber Skills campaign was launched on Monday 8th October.  ECSM learning modules were created  for the campaign with European Schoolnet (under a service contract with the EC for delivering the Better  Internet for Kids core service platform and coordination of the Insafe network of Safer Internet Centres in  Europe); and as part of the #SaferInternet4EU campaign launched on Safer Internet Day (SID) 2018 by  Commissioner Mariya Gabriel to promote online safety, media literacy and cyber hygiene. This initiative  stems from the Digital Education Action Plan and sets out a series of initiatives to support citizens,  educational institutions and education systems to better adapt for life and work in an age of rapid digital  change.  4 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWNUHaxensE&t=1s  5 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZlxR6nBYCLM&t=97s  ECSM 2018 Deployment Report  January 2019  16  Key message of the campaign –  Advancing cybersecurity skills and education of younger generations as an important means for keeping  themselves and others safe.  Just like the physical world there are threats online that could pose a danger  to children and young adults physically, emotionally and financially. Building cybersecurity skills and  competences helps the younger generation to develop routine cyber hygiene practices which they can  then transfer to others and help protect society.  The target audience for Get Cyber Skilled campaign were parents, teachers, guardians, role models and  community leaders responsible for developing cybersecurity education and skills in young people.  As part of the campaign, four ECSM learning modules were developed to help you create a study plan for  your class. Topics include:   Password management6   Backing up data7   Privacy settings8   Protecting against social engineering9  The campaign included a toolkit10 to help partners and Member States support with the outreach of the  campaign.  Week 3 – Theme 3: Recognize Cyber Scams  The theme aimed at educating the general public on how to identify deceiving content in order to keep  both themselves and their finances safe online.  The internet has become very attractive for cybercriminals. Attackers are using sophisticated tricks and  promises to wrench money or valuable financial information out of users. Scams featuring a long-lost  deceased relative or Nigerian princes are not the only tricks in the book anymore. The tactics used by  cybercriminals are becoming increasingly innovative and harder to detect. From pretending to be the  CEO of your organisation to impersonating a romantic interest, the online scammers of today will do what  it takes to get what they want –money and/or banking credentials.  6 https://cybersecuritymonth.eu/get-cyber-skilled/education-modules/education-modules/what-is-a- password-and-why-is-it-important  7 https://cybersecuritymonth.eu/get-cyber-skilled/education-modules/education-modules/what-is- backup-and-why-is-it-important  8 https://cybersecuritymonth.eu/get-cyber-skilled/education-modules/education-modules/what-is-social- enjineering-and-why-is-it-a-threat  9 https://cybersecuritymonth.eu/get-cyber-skilled/education-modules/education-modules/what-is-social- enjineering-and-why-is-it-a-threat  10 https://cybersecuritymonth.eu/get-cyber-skilled/partner-pack  https://cybersecuritymonth.eu/get-cyber-skilled/education-modules/education-modules/what-is-a-password-and-why-is-it-important https://cybersecuritymonth.eu/get-cyber-skilled/education-modules/education-modules/what-is-a-password-and-why-is-it-important https://cybersecuritymonth.eu/get-cyber-skilled/education-modules/education-modules/what-is-backup-and-why-is-it-important https://cybersecuritymonth.eu/get-cyber-skilled/education-modules/education-modules/what-is-backup-and-why-is-it-important https://cybersecuritymonth.eu/get-cyber-skilled/education-modules/education-modules/what-is-social-enjineering-and-why-is-it-a-threat https://cybersecuritymonth.eu/get-cyber-skilled/education-modules/education-modules/what-is-social-enjineering-and-why-is-it-a-threat https://cybersecuritymonth.eu/get-cyber-skilled/education-modules/education-modules/what-is-social-enjineering-and-why-is-it-a-threat https://cybersecuritymonth.eu/get-cyber-skilled/education-modules/education-modules/what-is-social-enjineering-and-why-is-it-a-threat https://cybersecuritymonth.eu/get-cyber-skilled/partner-pack  ECSM 2018 Deployment Report  January 2019  17  As such, Europol and the European Banking Federation launched an awareness campaign on the 7 most  common online financial scams.  Europol’s European Cybercrime Centre (EC3), the European Banking Federation and their partners from  the public and private sector participated in the campaign and included the #CyberScams awareness  campaign as part of the European Cyber Security Month.  Law enforcement agencies from all 28 EU Member States, 5 non- EU Member States, 24 national banking  associations and banks and many other cybercrime fighters raised awareness about this criminal  phenomenon.  This pan-European endeavour was driven by a communication campaign and national law  enforcement, bank associations and financial institutions that was communicated via social media  channels.  For this campaign, awareness-raising material was developed in 27 languages, available for public  download, which includes information on the 7 most common online financial scams, and how to avoid  them:   CEO fraud: scammers pretend to be your CEO or senior representative in the organisation and trick  you into paying a fake invoice or making an unauthorised transfer out of the business account.   Invoice fraud: they pretend to be one of your clients/suppliers and trick you into paying future invoices  into a different bank account.   Phishing/Smishing/Vishing: they call you, send you a text message or an email to trick you into sharing  your personal, financial or security information.   Spoofed bank website fraud: they use bank phishing emails with a link to the spoofed website. Once  you click on the link, various methods are used to collect your financial and personal information. The  site will look like its legitimate counterpart, with small differences.   Romance scam: they pretend to be interested in a romantic relationship. It commonly takes place on  online dating websites, but scammers often use social media or email to make contact.   Personal data theft: they harvest your personal information via social media channels.   Investment and online shopping scams: they make you think you are on a smart investment… or  present you with a great fake online offer.  Week 4 – Theme 4: Emerging Technologies and Privacy  Stay tech wise and safe with the latest emerging technologies.  The plan for week 4 of the campaign included a live webinar by ENISA experts and external experts from  Industry with the purpose of discussing the importance of having an “Emerging Technologies Horizon  Scanning and Research Process”, however the activity was postponed to a later date.  Member State Campaigns Overview  The following section provides an overview of the campaigns executed at the Member State level,  described in their own words.  4.3.1 Austria  A brief overview over some of the activities conducted in the course of the European Cyber Security Month  (ECSM) in 2018 in Austria are presented below.

https://cybersecuritymonth.eu/get-cyber-skilled/education-modules  ECSM 2018 Deployment Report  January 2019  23  4.3.3 Estonia  The CERT of the Estonian Information System Authority (RIA) decided this year to celebrate the October  cyber security month by conducting small cyber-hygiene events all around Estonia. In addition to the  employees of RIA we invited our partners from other government offices, schools and private companies  (e.g., cyber security enterprises) to seek out potential local community audiences and talk to them about  basic cyber hygiene.  This sort of action of mobilizing people around a communal project in their own communities has a long  history in Estonia. Traditionally this has been an agricultural undertaking, for example the harvesting of  potatoes. This is called “talgud” in Estonian. This year we decided to have “talgud” in the field of cyber  security, where everyone who is able, could participate in their own communities.  The Cyber Security Month “talgud” event or roadshow started with an invitation. We invited schools, local  libraries, general practitioners of medicine and other entities to sign up to these “talgud” – essentially  inviting someone to come to talk about the importance of cyber hygiene. Then we assigned volunteer  experts to the places. Altogether, about 30 people (half of them from RIA and half from our partner  organizations) visited about 30 places on October 15th (with a couple of exceptions).  Among the offices where our experts went were:   the staff of the Estonian parliament;   two news organizations,   schools and school-related organizations (school libraries, teacher assemblies, etc) and   health centers.  Volunteer experts also called up their own childhood schools or health centers, where they visited the  healthcare personnel and offered free trainings.  Among the volunteers were cyber security experts from RIA, experts from other government offices,  employees and owners of private cyber security companies, diplomats and lawyers. In every part of the  “talgud”, the volunteers were aided by leaflets and other materials provided by CERT-EE.  4.3.4 Finland  National Cyber Security Centre in Finland had two national online campaigns with social media activities  during ECSM 2018. We also participated in the Cyber Security Nordic Conference and Exhibition with the  Finnish Security Committee and Population Register Centre 10.- 11.10.2018.  We were active during #CyberScam-week also and took part in national cyber scam campaign with Finnish  Police and Finance Finland (FFI) mainly in Twitter and Facebook.  We started ECSM month with our national password campaign \"The longer the better\". A password needs  to be long enough, and it should not be too simple. We encouraged citizens to change their password to  something safer.  Here's our #thelongerthebetter password video:   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7CVFv18ldw   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJq92PlHCC0 (Swedish version)  The videos were kind of overture to our main national campaign which started 8 November. The campaign  ended during the first week of November.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7CVFv18ldw https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJq92PlHCC0  ECSM 2018 Deployment Report  January 2019  24  The main character of Finland's national cyber security campaign was a middle aged man called “Teijo”  who is very excited, and especially about passwords, backups and updates. He was very keen on giving  advice about these themes to his colleagues at his workplace. Teijo also spread around cyber security  themed aphorisms - #securisms - like \"Life is short, password long\" or \"Hard work calls for hard updates\".  We made three “1 minute” videos (in Finnish, with Finnish subtitles)   Teijo and passwords  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JXX9fm8P_20&list=PLcYs3a0AMHVl4VDNc56rybJtNFymTknUA&in dex=2   Teijo and backups  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rmhiPZ4j5sM&list=PLcYs3a0AMHVl4VDNc56rybJtNFymTknUA   Teijo and updates  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mj_6XX6GpbM&  Humourous and carefully made video scripts with clear main messages were the keys to our campaigns’  success. Our strategy was not to try to say or teach everybody, everything at the same time. We support a  “No more than 3 messages” approach. Hence, we focused on passwords, backups and updates.  4.3.5 France  The 6th edition of ECSM campaign was coordinated at the national level by ANSSI, the national authority  for cybersecurity and cyberdefence, in France. The program of the campaign was ambitious, aiming to  raise awareness and provide advice and recommendations in both the work place and at home.  For this year’s campaign, ANSSI, the national authority on cybersecurity and cyberdefence, worked  alongside more than 20 institutional partners (ministries, association, non-profit organisation, national  authorities, etc.) to build the national program all through October, focusing on the themes defined at the  European level as well as the motto “Cybersecurity is a shared responsibility!’.  More than 80 activities were organized in France during the month. These activities involved:   Conferences and workshops on cybersecurity issues for various events and audiences (companies,  students, and administrations) hosted by the national ECSC partners such as ANSSI, the regional  Chambers of Commerce and Industry, prefecture, etc.   An active awareness campaign online, sharing tips and good practices all through the month with the  #ECSM and #TousSecNum. The idea was to shed light onto the existing cybersecurity tool kit that  includes infographics, videos, etc.   Original activities :   First French participation to the European cybersecurity challenge (14th – 17th October) – a great  event to promote cybersecurity skills and training (theme n°2)   The collaboration with a French cartoonist, Fix, to use humor and art as a way to raise awareness  about cybersecurity. The cartoons were translated in English (subtitles). It also led to a common  promotion of ANSSI (France) and BSI (Germany) productions on twitter.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JXX9fm8P_20&list=PLcYs3a0AMHVl4VDNc56rybJtNFymTknUA&index=2 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JXX9fm8P_20&list=PLcYs3a0AMHVl4VDNc56rybJtNFymTknUA&index=2 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rmhiPZ4j5sM&list=PLcYs3a0AMHVl4VDNc56rybJtNFymTknUA https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mj_6XX6GpbM&  ECSM 2018 Deployment Report  January 2019  25  Figure 2: Funny Cartoon Images used in the French Campaign to Promote Cyber Security Awareness  To promote ECSM messages and activities, a communication plan was defined by ANSSI and its partners  including:   Participation of the Secretary of States for digital Affairs, M. Mounir Mahjoubi to the kick-off European  video   Creation of a dedicated webpage on ANSSI’s website to promote the ECSM activities :  https://www.ssi.gouv.fr/agence/cybersecurite/mois-de-la-cybersecurite-2018/   Diffusion of a dedicated press release   Regular publications on partners’ website and social networks about ECSM, both in French and English  (statistics to be consolidated)   Creation of banners created for this 2018 edition to call people to take action and be part of ECSM on  their social networks and website, using a communication kit.  4.3.6 Germany  The 6th edition of ECSM campaign was coordinated at the national level by BSI, the Federal Office for  Information Security, in Germany.  General  In general, 192 events and local campaigns have taken place in Germany as part of the ECSM  Cybersecmonth 2018. The BSI gained 104 partners, among them state ministries, criminal investigation  departments, chambers of industry and commerce, associations, medias, enterprises and others.  Moreover the BSI was focussing on Practice Basic Cyber Hygiene at home and at work.  Press  https://www.ssi.gouv.fr/agence/cybersecurite/mois-de-la-cybersecurite-2018/  ECSM 2018 Deployment Report  January 2019  26  BSI published a press release11 on the first of October. At the start of the ECSM a graphic visualising a  \"smart home\" with four rooms was published on the website12. Each room contained one digital device.  Each week one room \"opened\" (as it turned from grey to coloured) and another digital device was the  central theme for tips around IT-security at home. Within this topic the BSI presented facts and  recommendations for more security around: router, computer, smartphone and IoT devices.  Figure 3: \"Is your smart home secure?\" - from the German ECSM Campaign  Social media  The BSI released four Facebook polls asking: \"Be honest, how good is your cyber hygiene?\"   First week: Did you changed the password, when you first installed your router?   Second week: Do you immediately install updates when available?   Third week: Which kind of access authorisation do you permit your app?   Fourth week: Do you know exactly what kind of data is stored by your wearable device?  Additionally the BSI published an awareness-video. Its central question is: Do you really have nothing to  hide?' The advice and answer is: 'Take cyber security seriously to protect your privacy!'  11 https://www.bsi.bund.de/DE/Presse/Pressemitteilungen/Presse2018/ECSM‐Start_01102018.html  12 https://www.bsi-fuer-buerger.de/BSIFB/DE/Service/Aktuell/Informationen/Artikel/basisschutz_fuer_den_router.html  https://www.bsi.bund.de/DE/Presse/Pressemitteilungen/Presse2018/ECSM-Start_01102018.html https://www.bsi-fuer-buerger.de/BSIFB/DE/Service/Aktuell/Informationen/Artikel/basisschutz_fuer_den_router.html  ECSM 2018 Deployment Report  January 2019  27  Furthermore the BSI intensified Social Media interactions with Europol, France, Belgie, Luxemburg and  Sweden within Facebook and Twitter to show European ECSM actions in the BSI channels.  Events  The BSI organised a workshop to discuss opportunities and risks around the internet of things. During the  event an illustrator painted an infographic containing all the ideas and input by the participants13.  Figure 4: Risks and Opportunities along with IoT – from the German ECSM Campaign  Network  The BSI channel for economics distributed four illustrations14 to raise awareness for cyber security among  enterprises, organisations and institutions. The visuals were shared with the hashtag #ecsm by these  partners and the BSI Twitter channels.  13 https://www.bsi.bund.de/SharedDocs/Videos/DE/BSI/Interviews/IoT‐workshop‐bsi‐2018‐10‐25  14 https://www.allianz‐fuer‐cybersicherheit.de/ACS/DE/Micro/Awareness/awareness_node.html  https://www.bsi.bund.de/SharedDocs/Videos/DE/BSI/Interviews/IoT-workshop-bsi-2018-10-25 https://www.allianz-fuer-cybersicherheit.de/ACS/DE/Micro/Awareness/awareness_node.html  ECSM 2018 Deployment Report  January 2019  28  Figure 5: Key-Passwords in Cyber Security - from the German ECSM Campaign  Intern  Last but not least the BSI promoted the ECSM in the BSI-Intranet by informing employees about cyber risks  day-by-day for one week. In the end employees were invited to take part in a quiz.  4.3.7 Hungary  In Hungary, ESCM2018 awareness campaign was coordinated by the National Cyber Security Center (NCSC  Hungary).  The objective of the Hungarian campaign was to raise awareness for the Hungarian citizens (for several  different groups and of different ages) about the main cybersecurity related topics, and to create better  cooperation and professional discussions about the new cyber security trends and challenges.  Figure 6: About Phishing-Mails and Counter Protection - from the German ECSM Campaign  ECSM 2018 Deployment Report  January 2019  29  As a campaign coordinator, NCSC-Hungary and its 25 campaign partners organised 34 different types of  events or campaign elements (for example online campaign) between 28th September and 8th of  November.  During the campaign there was a great variety of events in the programme: there were several  conferences in different topics, awareness lessons at elementary schools, round table discussions, carrier  discussions, cyber challenges for university students, cybersecurity “quiz shows”, cybersecurity escape  rooms, university conferences, poster competitions and exhibitions, online campaigns etc.  To promote the ECSM campaign, the events, and the messages we used several communicational channels  and awareness techniques:   NCSC-Hungary created a website for the Hungarian ECSM campaign, where people can find info about  the EU campaign, the Hungarian elements, events, posters and awareness materials, partners, photos  about the evets and a cybersecurity online quiz also:  https://kiberhonap.hu/   NCSC- Hungary created a dedicated Facebook account for the ECSM in Hungary, where we posted the  ECSM events, awareness materials, posters, videos and interesting articles about the ECSM topics:  @Kiberhónap Magyarország   NCSC-Hungary, Hungarian Police and the Hungarian Banking Association held a common press  conference about phishing campaigns   NCSC-Hungary organized a kickoff event, the Cybersec 2018.hu conference on 2th of October that has  audience from the public and private sector and from the academia also.   NCSC Hungary created a cybersecurity online quiz ( 2 level:1 for general users and for IT security  experts)   NCSC-Hungary created 2 Hungarian poster about the ECSM2018 campaign.  Figure 7: Posters on Cyber Security Awareness from the Hungarian ECSM Campaign  https://kiberhonap.hu/  ECSM 2018 Deployment Report  January 2019  30  4.3.8 Luxembourg  In Luxembourg, the ECSM activities 2018 were carried out by 5 local partners, coordinated by the Ministry  of the Economy. Partners this year were the Luxembourg Bankers’ Association (ABBL); the national  initiative for promoting a safer internet (BEE SECURE); the national Police; RESTENA CSIRT/UNI LU, and  Security made in Lëtzebuerg - the national portal for promoting information security and the cybersecurity  ecosystem.  Figure 8: Luxembourgish ECSM Campaign Banner  National activities included:   social media posts   a landing page for the Europol “cyber scams” campaign (see also here)   Translation into Luxembourgish of the Europol information material   a national awareness campaign on online relationships   a cyber-day at University of Luxembourg campus,   a dedicated Luxembourg cybersecurity week (15-20 October), with over 25 events including a Gala  Awards evening  While all of the activities (gathering an estimated total of over 2000 participants) covered this year’s ECSM  topics, two of them specifically reached out to women in the cyber world. The Gala Awards evening (200  attendees) included a special address by Mariya Gabriel, EU Commissioner for Digital Economy and  Society, and the presence of Mrs Despina Spanou, Director for Digital society, trust and cybersecurity at  the EU Commission. Six awards were distributed: CISO of the Year; Best Inclusion Initiative; Most Promising  Cybersecurity Solution (Jury’s choice and people’s choice); Best Talk; Most Promising Young Talent.  https://www.abbl.lu/2018/10/17/cyber-security-luxembourg-mobilises-to-raise-public-awareness/ https://police.public.lu/fr/actualites/2018/10/w42/17-cyberscams.html https://www.bee-secure.lu/fr/campagnes/love-stories-40 https://wwwde.uni.lu/universitaet/aktuelles/termine/conference_cyberday_2018 https://cybersecurityweek.lu/  ECSM 2018 Deployment Report  January 2019  31  Figure 9: Cyber Security Awareness Event in Luxembourg – Gala e-Awards Night  “Be Cyber Aware”, an internal EC staff awareness raising initiative of the European Commission DG DIGIT,  organised their “IT security day” in Luxembourg during the ECSM, with the possibility of a closer  partnership in the future.  At national press level, 2 press releases were send out by the ministry of the Economy and articles were  published in 6 local magazines/newspapers (It nation; Paperjam; Silicon; Beast; Itone and Merkur).  In view of the growing success of the “Luxembourg week” within the ECSM, we may consider extending  the focus, from 1 to 2 weeks for the next edition.  All in all, the October month in Luxembourg contributed to increase the interest in cybersecurity with the  public at large, raising visibility of public and private actors in charge, as well as to position Luxembourg as  a key European player in cybersecurity.  4.3.9 Malta  During the European Cyber Security Month, Malta launched its second national awareness campaign for  the coming years. This campaign intends to focus further on awareness and education in cyber security  within various sectors of Maltese society. The Campaign was officially launched on Tuesday 16th October  during an event held at Fort Sant’ Angelo, Birgu with keynote speakers being the Minister for Home Affairs  and National Security, the Parliamentary Secretary for Financial Services, Digital Economy and Innovation,  the ENISA Director, the Executive Chairman as well as the Head of Information Security and Governance of  MITA – the Government IT Agency responsible for its implementation. Key stakeholders from the public  and private sector were invited. The launch also led to the rollout of a new Website on Cyber Security as  well as social media channels including Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and YouTube, apart from further use  of traditional media such as radio, TV, newspapers and street advertising.  A ‘Capture the Flag’ Hackathon event – Malta Cyber Crusades 2018 was also held on 26th and 27th October,  as a means to attract individuals towards cyber security skills uptake. It was open for individuals over 17  years of age. Over 40 persons, including students from tertiary institutions participated. This was the first  of its kind held by MITA. Nonetheless a number of lessons learnt were taken note of for future  considerations. They included further promotion prior to the event, further detailed training to beginners  ECSM 2018 Deployment Report  January 2019  32  prior to the actual challenge, and prize categories for those already having expertise and those who are  still beginners in such cyber security challenges.  Focus group sessions, in collaboration with Maltese SME representative bodies were also held on the 17th,  23rd and 26th October respectively. Such sessions served as a means to understand better the cyber  security concerns and experiences amongst SMES and on ways of how related awareness can be reached  to them more effectively. Amongst the lessons learnt were the need of other similar interactive or  collaborative measures in the future as means for SMES to share knowledge and experience on cyber  security, including awareness.  4.3.10 Norway  This year was the sixth time, The Norwegian Center for Information Security (NorSIS) has been the national  coordinator for the National Security Month in Norway.  We have made a few changes this year, which we believe have been very successful. One of our changes is  the broadening of our target group. Since our previous efforts and focusing on reaching small and medium  sizes businesses, this time we have also been targeting the general population and larger businesses as  well.  Although ENISA’s campaign has four themes, we decided to concentrate on two themes, that is, “fake  email” and “online fraud”. This is on the basis of feedback from previous Norwegian campaigns.  Actions and activities  We kicked off the Norwegian Cyber Security Month with a free conference in Oslo the 27th of September.  There were about 200 participants at the conference and about 100 people who followed the streaming of  it on YouTube.  Our main effort and contribution to the campaign was the same this year as earlier years. The  development, project managing and distribution of a security training kit for companies. This kit contains a  presentation that managers are encouraged to hold for their employees in order to motivate them to  follow an e-learning course on cyber security, also provided in the kit. The e-learning consists of 8 modules  that take about 3-5 minutes to complete. Furthermore, the training package consists of films, brochures  and other materials that managers can distribute in the office and among the employees to create  awareness with regards to information and cyber security.  This year’s e-learning reached 365 businesses with a total of 256,144 employees. This is a new record in  reach which we are very pleased with. Part of this success may be because we have used a new e-learning  provider this year. This has given us new opportunities for reaching larger businesses with the training kit.  There is however a challenge with low figures for completion of the e-learning that we will need to address  in next year’s campaign.  In order to reach the Norwegian population with our messages about information and cyber security, we  developed an e-learning course directed at the population. This course was launched on nettvett.no. The  course intends to reveal attempts of social manipulation, ransomware, phishing and other types of fraud.  Furthermore, it aims at helping the public to reveal fake contests and fake news in social media, teach  them what to consider before sharing photos and videos online, securing their computers and mobile  phones and detect fake emails.  In addition to the training kit, we facilitated a national lecture effort. Experts in information and cyber  security donated their time and themed lectures as a contribution to the campaign. This is published on a  ECSM 2018 Deployment Report  January 2019  33  website from which businesses can book lectures to educate and inspire their employees with people who  daily work with information security at different kind of levels.  Creating awareness in social media has been a natural part of this year’s campaign, for our core messages  and advertising the training kit as well as supporting other efforts. One such initiative was the National  Criminal Investigation Service (NCIS) with the spread of Europol's Cyberscam campaign in social Medias.  The campaign was well made and a success in terms of sharing and reach in social media.  Finally, in addition to NorSIS’s contribution, a number of experts, businesses, organisations and others  have arranged, coordinated and participated at a number of conferences, meetings and seminars  throughout the country in order to bring forward the message of “cybersecurity is a shared responsibility”.  We look forward to continuing this work throughout the year of October 2019. We would like to take this  opportunity to thank ENISA for your role and efforts in coordinating the European Cyber Security Month.  We look forward to working with you on next year´s campaign.  4.3.11 Poland  European Cybersecurity Month in Poland is coordinated by NASK National Research Institute. The  campaign has been organized for the sixth time but for the first time with such a flourish. A total of 45  initiatives has been reported and organized with cooperation of 30 partners and 7 honorary patrons: Prime  Minister, Minister of Digitalization, National Security Bureau, Ministry of Science and Higher Education,  Ministry of National Education, Ministry of Entrepreneurship and Technology, and Ministry of Health. The  campaign started with the Kick-off event on 1st of October.  Inauguration was an open event which took place in \"Przestrzeń from Facebook\" with presence of 90  guests: partners, representatives of administration, academy, business, NGO's, media and citizens.  During the ECSM celebrations in Poland, a total of 45 cyber security initiatives and events took place. Some  of them has been organized by NASK, some with cooperation with partners or partners alone. The main  goal was to spread the information about ECSM campaign to the wide audience and this is why the  initiatives were addressed to different target groups: professionals, children and adults, essential services  providers, public administration and digital services providers.  There were thematic conferences, experts  meetings, workshops for children and youth, school activities, information campaigns and educational  materials, open movies shows.  ECSM campaign was supported by communication held on the website www.bezpiecznymiesiac.pl -  visited in October over 16,7 thousand times, which is a 75% of increase in comparison to previous year. For  the first time ECSM in Poland was also present in social media. Thanks to the cooperation with Facebook,  1800 people socjety has been build on Facebook.  The campaign was also present on Twitter. Below are links to the ECSM social media:  - https://www.facebook.com/ECSMPL/  - https://twitter.com/EcsmPolska  The summary of all activities is presented on the NASK website and social media channel.  Some graphics produced for the campaign:  ECSM 2018 Deployment Report  January 2019  34  ECSM 2018 Deployment Report  January 2019  35  4.3.12 Portugal  The Portuguese National Cybersecurity Center (CNCS), the national point of contact with ENISA and in  charge of raising awareness on cyber security, in 2018, similarly to previous years, carried out an  awareness campaign within the scope of ECSM, which included offline activities - conferences, workshops,  talks, awareness podcasts on radio programs and other initiatives - and online - cybersecurity tips, through  the publication of posters, videos and posts on CNCS media channels.  In order to carry out this campaign, the CNCS had the involvement of national partners from different  sectors - education, health, media, academia, industry, IT associations - without which it would be difficult  to reach so many people.  The effort to convey the message that cybersecurity is a shared responsibility had positive outputs this  year, leading to the increase of the number of CNCS partners to carry out these initiatives, as well as to the  number of initiatives (in 2017 we have carried out 12 initiatives with 6 partners and in 2018 the number of  initiatives increased to 40, 23 of them being organized by basic schools, and the number of partners  increased to 40, being 23 of them schools). These activities were carried out in 30 cities or localities,  distributed throughout the country, in addition to the awareness initiatives carried out online by CNCS and  its partners.  ECSM 2018 Deployment Report  January 2019  36  It was found that the dissemination materials available on the ECSM website and the sharing of the  materials and information about campaigns that were being carried out by other countries were very  useful and served as inspiration for activities and initiatives in other countries or places.  4.3.13 Romania  This year’s ECSM 2018 campaign in Romania, we focused more than ever on social media interaction with  common users. Some of our main activities involved:   Social media cybersecurity awareness campaign (Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Instagram, YouTube).   On CERT-RO and partners social media channels we scheduled 3 to 4 daily posts on ECSM 2018 main  themes.   Fostering new public-private partnerships, with organizations very much interested in cyber security  awareness campaigns   Partnership with Digital Nation for FREE one month vouchers for cyber security course (12 months) if  users sign in during ECSM2018 campaign.   Partnership during ECSM2018 with PentestTools.com for FREE 250 credits that could enable users to  do multiple testing of their website security.   Ask me Anything campaign with CERT-RO team in the last day of the campaign on Reddit (r/Romania)   Like every year, we managed to have a cyber security course for influencers (journalists) during  ECSM2018.   Support for other campaigns during the month of October: CodeWeek, CodeKids, Safety in Online  (highschool campaign).   Support and direct involvement in the process of selection and training of Romania Team for European  Cyber Security Championship 2018   Cyber Security exercises: CyDex2018 (national cyber security exercise in Romania).   The CERT-RO annual international conference on cyber security during the month of October. The  event has always been part of the ECSM calendar of events in Romania.   Support for Europol and EBF campaign against online fraud on all channels.   TV news pieces regarding pressing cyber security issues and ongoing campaigns against RO common  users in online: vishing, phishing, scam.  Some Issues that we identified with respect to the ECSM calendar for editing by CERT-RO. In this context,  we found a great dependency on ENISA for any encountered issues, also in order to change info on events.  A higher control over what is published over Romanian events is recommended in the future.  Some additional remarks include that we need more materials that are formulated with a clear message.  We think that the materials provided by Europol are a great example in that direction. Also, we support  more video/gif materials for users. People are less inclined to read and social media is much happier to  push multimedia content on their channels. Organic reach could get much bigger this way.  4.3.14 Spain  In the light of the Cyber Security Month campaign, Spain organized a set of activities to promote  awareness and culture in cybersecurity.  There were several Organisms involved: Guardia Civil, National Police, National Institute for Cybersecurity  (INCIBE), National Cryptologic Centre (CCN), National Security Department, … Regarding the private sector,  there were many events and actions focused on that.  ECSM 2018 Deployment Report  January 2019  37  All these Organisms and Companies spread information by using their communications channels (webs,  social networks, etc.).  The most important event on October has been ENISE (12TH edition of the International Meeting on  Information Security, organized by the National Institute for Cybersecurity -INCIBE-), the major conference  on Information Security that gather top experts, investors and stakeholders in the sector, where more than  1.000 people attended.  The media content produced by Europol and financial sector, in collaboration with Law Enforcement  Agencies, delivered during the 3rd week (focused on Cyber Scams) was useful, and this model (making  resources in collaboration with European agencies), could be extended to the rest of activities.  Finally, is very welcome the initiative from ENISA for this year’s ECSM, according to which a National  Coordinator can approve, modify or deny the events before they are published at the ECSM website’s  portal.  ECSM 2018 Deployment Report  January 2019  38  5. Evaluation  Assessment of Implemented Actions based on the Evaluation Methodology  The evaluation metrics are a useful tool for collecting consistent information from MS coordinators  regarding the activities that they implemented during the ECSM. Given the different nature of the variant  ECSM activities, the evaluation methodology defined different metrics per type of activity. The following  categories of activities were identified and accompanied by respective metrics:   Conference/ Workshop activities   TV or Radio Advertisement activities   ECSM Website   Social Media Activities   Fair Stand/ Exhibition and Roadshows   Merchandising, Posters, Leaflets   Tests/Quizzes   ECSM Organization Effort  The following Member States, provided data for 2018:   Belgium   Bulgaria   Estonia   Finland   Germany   Hungary   Luxembourg   Malta   Poland   Portugal   Romania  The following Member States and EFTA countries, provided data for 2017, the base year of the evaluation:   Czech Republic   Germany   Latvia   Luxembourg   Norway   Poland   Slovenia  ECSM 2018 Deployment Report  January 2019  39  5.1.1 Results for Conference/ Workshop activities  The following figures demonstrate the average number of activities per MS with regards to the  organization of conferences and workshops for 2017 and 2018.  On average MS organized more events in 2018 compared to 2017, however the duration of the events  were maintained year on year.  The main target groups for MS were either General Users or Professional Users. The number of attendees  decreased compared to 2017, which may be the outcome of more targeted audience groups. The security  themes covered in conferences organized in 2018 included subjects such as IoT, Practice Basic Cyber  Hygiene, Expand your Digital Skills and Education, Recognise Cyber Scams, Cyber security training, and  Emerging Technologies and Privacy. Feedback from attendees was positive. Remarks highlighted that the  attendees favoured activities that included greater interaction (e.g., Capture the Flag, interactive sessions)  and appreciated targeted content and training.  5.1.2 Results for TV or Radio Advertisement activities  0  2  4  2017 2018  Average Figures per MS on  Organized Conferences  Average number of organized conferences per MS  Average Duration (Days) of conferences per MS  0  500  1000  2017 2018  Average Number of Attendees in  conferences per MS  ECSM 2018 Deployment Report  January 2019  40  Overall only few countries implemented TV or radio advertisements in 2018.

Average bounce rate and time visitors spent per MS  website increased year on year.  5.1.4 Results for Social Media Activities  ECSM activities employed by Facebook accounts are widely popular. The figures displayed above represent  the activities that took place during October 2018 for MS related accounts and posts. On average the MS  coordinators reduced the paid Facebook activities, while maintaining same amount of Followers, Likes and  Shares, with 2017.  0  1  2  3  2017 2018  Average Bounce Rate per MS website  Average time visitors spent (minutes) per MS website  0  10000  20000  30000  40000  50000  60000  Average Number of 'Likes' per  post per MS  Average Number of 'Shares' for posts per  MS  Average Number of Followers  per MS  Average Organic  Reach per MS  Average Paid Reach  per MS  Average Total Reach  per MS  Facebook Activities  2017 2018  ECSM 2018 Deployment Report  January 2019  42  Twitter activities were more effective in 2018 and contributed to the activities with almost 5000 average  number of followers per MS, and 12 retweets on average per post.  0  5  10  15  2017 2018  Average Number of Retweets per  MS  0  2000  4000  6000  2017 2018  Average Number of Followers per  MS  0  100  200  300  400  500  600  700  2017 2018  Average Number of videos' views  per MS  ECSM 2018 Deployment Report  January 2019  43  Finally some countries used YouTube channels and videos demonstrating an average number of almost  700 views per video.  5.1.5 Fair Stand/ Exhibition and Roadshows  0  2  4  6  8  2017 2018  Average view duration (minutes) per  MS  0  2  4  6  8  10  2017 2018  Average Number of events per MS  Average Number of Locations visited per MS  0  500  1000  1500  2000  2500  3000  Average Number of event visitors  Average Number of ECSM booth visitors  Average Cost  2017 2018  ECSM 2018 Deployment Report  January 2019  44  5.1.6 Merchandising, Posters, Leaflets  5.1.7 Tests/Quizzes  The implementation of Tests/Quizzed was less frequent in 2018. Belgium implemented a Quiz, which was  taken by 15000 individuals. Hungary also implemented a Quiz which was taken by 334 individuals.  5.1.8 Organizational effort  The participating MS reported that at least one full time employee in their organization worked on the  preparation and execution of ECSM 2018; one to three employees were occupied in the planning and  execution, with average 55 person days fully dedicated.  5.1.9 Overall results and conclusions  The assessment included in this chapter represents the first attempt in ECSM for a systematic and  comparative analysis of the ECSM activities across the Member States. ENISA developed an evaluation  strategy which was communicated and agreed among the MS coordinators. The objective of this effort is  to collect adequate information from the MS coordinators regarding the activities they organize during  ECSM each year and analyse them to produce useful findings for the future ECSM organizations.  0  2000  4000  6000  8000  10000  12000  2017 2018  Average Number of Units per MS Average Cost per MS  0  5  10  15  20  25  30  2017 2018  Average Number of Locations targeted  per MS  ECSM 2018 Deployment Report  January 2019  45  This report includes the analysis of the data for 2017 and 2018, with a perspective on the average  measures per Member State participating. The findings are divided per category of activity. Regarding the  organization of conferences and workshops within ECSM, the results showed an increased number of  activities in 2018 compared to 2017 and a decreased average number of attendees; the data reflects a  different approach by the MS coordinators to organize smaller events with targeted audience groups  compared to 2017 in which larger events were organized for more general audience. Further, there was a  significant increase on the use of advertisements in 2018 (the average number of advertisements per MS  was increased four times). Similarly, the activities of roadshows, fair stands and exhibitions were  significantly increased in 2018 in terms of number of visited events, visited locations, and reach. The  impact of the activities through websites, Facebook and YouTube was relatively the same. LinkedIn was  not popular in both periods. On the other hand, Tweeter activities were boosted in 2018 with increased  number of followers and retweets. Finally, MS coordinators reported that it is difficult to estimate the cost  of organization for activities, particularly because most activities are co-organized.  Finally, a limitation on the findings of this assessment is that the MS that participate in ECSM are  commonly variant among the years, making the results less comparable however this will be remedied in  future years.  ECSM Campaign Survey Questionnaire  The questionnaire is an important tool used to gather the opinions of the MS coordinators that are  engaged in the campaign. The charts below present the replies of 15 participants representing their MS.  An increase of 3 participants compared to the previous year.  5.2.1 Member States replies  1. How would you rate the overall implementation of the ECSM 2018 campaign (scale 1-5)?  2. Did ECSM support in a satisfactory manner the outreach and promotion of your work?  ECSM 2018 Deployment Report  January 2019  46  3. Did ECSM add value to your national campaign?  4. Did ECSM offer opportunities for improving your national campaigns through collaboration with other  Countries?  5. Do you think ENISA succeeded in the sharing and promotion of new ideas among ECSM partners?  ECSM 2018 Deployment Report  January 2019  47  6. Did the kick video clip produced for ECSM support your national campaign?  7. Could ECSM better promote the awareness material produced by its partners’ campaigns?  8. Would you want ENISA to facilitate in the engagement of the private sector in future campaigns?  ECSM 2018 Deployment Report  January 2019  48  9. Would you want to further align ECSM with international awareness raising campaigns?  10. Do you think that ECSM offers opportunities for fostering a pan-European cyber security culture?  ECSM 2018 Deployment Report  January 2019  49  5.2.2 Consolidated results  MS coordinators valued the implementation of campaign to be good and above based on the results of Q1.  This result is slightly better than last year’s results as all answers are marked as positive.  Again this year, the overwhelming majority of MS coordinators agreed that the campaign added value to  their work, and that it supports their local national campaigns throughout the promotion of their work (Q2  and Q3). Two partners have encouraged the ECSM campaign to use available communications channels  more efficiently (e.g., twitter, Facebook) and to better promote partners’ produced awareness materials.  The majority of MS coordinators (66,6%) are convinced that the campaign offered opportunities for  collaboration and sharing of ideas among the MS and only the 13, 3% believes that this is not the case  (Q4). On the other hand 53, 3% believe that ECSM offers opportunities for improving the national  campaigns through collaboration with other countries, while a 26,6% believes it does not (Q5).  Feedback on the added value of this year’s ECSM kick-off video clip was positive from the majority of  partners. 60% believe that the video clip successfully supported the national campaigns, while only a 26,  6% thought otherwise (Q6). 40% of MS coordinators denoted that the ECSM could do better in promoting  the MS awareness material (Q7). The feedback for better promotion of material included the following  suggestions on how this could be achieved:   Use additional channels to promote national campaigns’ awareness material, such as Facebook, in  addition to existing ones as it is the ECSM website and twitter   Awareness material and core messages should be promoted with more graphical/video content and in  all languages   Awareness messages should be more charming/funny and thus more attractive to the target audience   Use the ECSM communication Tools (social network, website etc.) to support the national campaigns  on the basis of the 2018 infographics per countries   Use the coordination skills of ENISA to facilitate common projects involving ENISA and numerous  Member States   Place a greater effort and interaction in twitter to supporting the Member States’ campaigns (“liking”  and more “sharing”)  Feedback related to the private sector’s engagement in future campaigns was positive amongst 66% of the  participants however 34% rejected or hesitated to respond (Q8). A suggestion from a MS coordinator was  that this should be discussed in a future ECSM meeting amongst the MS:  “It is good to have the private actors involved, as they can reach a greater audience, however the engagement of private  actors should remain a decision taken at the national level. Each member state has a différent organization and rules  to integrate the private sector in its campaign.”  Finally, the majority of MS coodinators were positive about the prospect of aligning ECSM with  international campaigns at 86,6% (Q9) and all MS coordinators fully supported the ECSM campaign for  offering more and more opportunities for fostering EU-wide cyber security culture (Q10).  Web analytics  Web analytics provided the statistical data for ECSM web site and social media channels. The purpose of  gathering these figures were to evaluate the impact and visibility of the campaign.  ECSM 2018 Deployment Report  January 2019  50  5.3.1 ECSM Web Page  The analysis takes into consideration multiple variables in relation to different types of access points to the  ECSM website for the period of October and include:   Page views: 99,057   Website visits: 27,100   Downloads: 1,538  Figure 10: Graph overview of ECSM web site visits in October 2018.  Below is a comparison between this year’s campaign and previous years with respect to the number of  page views to the ECSM webpage. Statistics demonstrate that the ECSM website achieved stable growth in  2018, post the above average growth for 2017.  Figure 11: Overview of annual increase of ECSM page views  5.3.2 NIS Quiz  The total number of NIS Quiz page views for this year’s campaign reached 62,997 views out of a total of  approximately 142,294 views to the web site, which took place in the period from 1st September to 15th of  November. Within 1st to 31st of October 2018, the total number of page views reached 15,191, a small  decrease from the previous year. These statistics demonstrate the popularity that the NIS quiz has gained  during the campaign, equating to approximately 17,6% of the total ECSM website traffic.  48000 52000 57890  92507  99057  2014 2015 2016 2017 2018  ECSM 2018 Deployment Report  January 2019  51  Figure 12: NIS quiz page views within ECSM October’s events.  The 62,997 views of the NIS Quiz from 1st September to 15th of November can be further broken down  between the views to the main page and the introductory video of the quiz as follows:   28,507 page views were dedicated to accessing the main NIS Quiz page   6,040 page views were dedicated for accessing the introductory YouTube video of the quiz  The total number of visitors succeeding to complete the NIS Quiz during month October and compared to  previous years decreased from 2392 in 2017, to 1,822 in 2018. This year’s statistics have also shown that  from a total number of 15,191 visits to the main NIS Quiz main page, only 1,822 visitors eventually  managed to complete it, a total of approximately 12%.  5.3.3 ECSM Map of Activities  The images below illustrate the number of events taking placing in October and the number of Member  States / EFTA countries and other European countries organizing activities. The left hand side graph  presents the total number of events registered each year from 2014 to 2018.  On the right hand side, the  number of EU countries for which at least one event is registered for the same period, is also illustrated.  Figure 13: Number of activities in October and the number of countries registering activities annually  The rate of growth in 2018 has shown a stable increase of submitted events since previous year’s  campaign. A stable growth rate of events year on year were recorded from inception up until 2015,  wherein the number of events registered almost doubled in 2016. The growth in the number of events  registered is an outcome of the increased popularity of the campaign, which grows steadily on a yearly  basis.  184 242  455  532 567  2014 2015 2016 2017 2018  30 32 32 37 35  2 0 1 4 2 0 1 5 2 0 1 6 2 0 1 7 2 0 1 8  COUNTRIES  PARTICIPATION  ECSM 2018 Deployment Report  January 2019  52  The top ten MS with respect to the number of events registered during October are displayed in the pie  charts below for 2017 and 2018. A notable difference from last year’s campaign is Poland and Hungary,  that are now included in the top 5 MS with the most number of registered activities.  Figure 14: Top Ten countries with respect to the number of events registered for ECSM 2017 and 2018  5.3.4 Social Media  Twitter continues to support the promotion and outreach of the campaign. The figures below demonstrate  the fluctuation of twitter followers from September until November 2018 for the handle  @CyberSecMonth. The highest peak corresponds to the launch of ECSM and specifically the Kick-off event  on the 1st of October, followed by renewed interest again until the latter end of the month.  Useful statistics that are extracted from the graph are:   The total number of followers reached 16,500   The amount of 1,667 new accounts were created within this three month period  Figure 15: The daily growth of Twitter followers from September to November 2018 to @CyberSecMonth  The graph below tracks the growth in the number of twitter followers of @CyberSecMonth over time.

ECSM 2018 Deployment Report  January 2019  53  Figure 16: Annual number of Twitter followers @CyberSecMonth  5.3.5 Media Reach  The European Cyber Security Month (ECSM) project was supported by an impactful Digital Public Affairs  cross-channel campaign led by the hashtag #CyberSecMonth. The statistical results of the campaign  demonstrate a stellar online impact endorsed by a remarkable amount of mentions, reach and social  media interactions.  A total number of 1655 articles that mention ECSM from the period 24th of September till the 9th of  November have been recorded with a total estimated reach of audience exposed of 9051133. The  majority of #CyberSecMonth mentions were created on Twitter (829) and Instagram (351), followed by  Facebook (313) and traditional blogs (20).  The following statistics provide in-depth insights into the impact of the #CyberSecMonth campaign, and  the general exposure of the Digital Public Affairs campaign supporting the European Cyber Security Month.

(Source Twitter Analytics).   The most successful media tweet this month was related to the #GetCyberSkilled Learning event which  earned over 100 engagements. (Source Twitter Analytics).  5.3.7 Conclusions  The majority of the indicators used to evaluate the campaign demonstrate a higher growth rate year on  year. For this year, a linear growth has been noticeable with respect to the rate of Twitter followers, the  ECSM web page views, ECSM map of activities, the campaigns online reach, while a rather substantial  increase on the articles that mention ECSM was recorded. Some analytics did demonstrate a small  decrease in comparison to previous year such as the NIS quiz page views and completion attempts.  Conclusively, the increase of the ECSM campaign’s popularity is visible in all numbers, contributing towards  an indisputable higher performance in comparison to all previous years, leading to a successful campaign  also for ECSM 2018.  ECSM 2018 Deployment Report  January 2019  56  6. Conclusions  The evaluation of the campaign is based on the analytical data gathered, the feedback received from MS  coordinators and for the first time the use of evaluation metrics data from the base year of 2017. The  campaign continues to grow in line with expectations and the long term growth rate. Several of the factors  that contributed to the success of the campaign in 2018 were:   the increased commitment by the Member States towards awareness raising,   the “Get Cyber Skilled” campaign supported by the European Commission, European Schoolnet and  SaferInternet4EU campaign,   the awareness campaign executed by EC3 & EBF related to “Cyberscams”   and outreach using social media channels.  In the ECSM deployment report of 2017 a number of observations were made by ENISA to support the  success of the campaign going forward. These observations are revisited below and include updates on  how they were addressed during the year.  6.1.1 Evaluation metrics  This was the second year that evaluation metrics were collected from the MS and resulted in the first year  a comparison could be drawn from previous year’s results to evaluate the campaigns progress.  The  number of Member States contributing to the evaluation metrics increased from seven in 2017 to ten in  2018, however only three countries reported in both years.  Although the results are averaged per MS,  comparable results will only be achieved once all MS are providing comprehensive metrics year on year.  6.1.2 Member State Commitment  The core campaign coordinators participating actively in the monthly conference calls and physical  meeting increased with the addition of Belgium and Malta.  Member States & EFTA countries actively participating in the campaign include: Austria, Belgium Czech  Republic, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Hungary, Luxembourg, Malta, Netherlands, Norway, Portugal  Poland, Romania, Slovenia, and Switzerland.  6.1.3 Private Sector Involvement  The private sector continued to show much willingness to contribute to the campaign.  The structure and  form of such an engagement remains to be decided by the MS.  6.1.4 Governance Structure  The proposal for the introduction of a governance structure was a moot point for some of the MS during  the physical meeting in Brussels.  Concerns raised included obligations, responsibilities, keeping deadlines  and loss of flexibility if a governance structure was in place, whilst for others considered a governance  structure as overkill given that there is not budgetary decisions to make.  6.1.5 Collaboration with the European Commission  There was a step up in collaboration with the European Commission during the run up to October.  A  number of significant steps were taken to cross promote each other’s efforts.  The first being the  saferinternet4EU campaign for which ENISA supported with the Get Cyber Skilled campaign during week  two and the second being the award of European Schoolnet competition for which the ENISA Executive  Director was Ambassador.  ECSM 2018 Deployment Report  January 2019  57  6.1.6 Annual ECSM Launch Event  It was decided during the physical meeting in Brussels with the MS that the annual kick-off event to launch  the campaign will be replaced by a kick-off video featuring the MS with messages and a call to action.  The  video included messages from seven MS in their local languages and also a message and call to action from  the Commissioner Mariya Gabriel.  As of the December 2018 the kick-off video has had over 1500 views in the space of two months that will  continue to grow over time. If we are to compare the amount of viewers of the video with the amount of  participants present at the 2017 annual ECSM kick-off event in Tallinn, the outreach of the video is tenfold.  Thus the decision to use video as a medium to reach out to European citizens has been vindicated by the  numbers; however much work is needed to reach the millions of citizens of Europe.

Executive Summary  Last year’s joint communication to the European Parliament and the Council for the building up of  cybersecurity for the EU included a call to Member States (MS) to make cyber-awareness a priority in  awareness campaigns.  The communication from the European Commission went on to explicitly mention  the Cybersecurity month (ECSM) and how it should be scaled up to achieve a greater reach as a common  communication effort at EU and national level.  This sets the scene for the 2018 campaign, the first campaign post the announcement. Indeed the 2018  European Cyber Security Month saw a step up by the MS in their engagement in the campaign.  The  number of MS taking an active role increased, however more importantly the collaboration of the MS in  the planning and execution phases ensured that the sixth campaign continued to outperform previous  years as measured by year on year results.  Highlights of 2018 campaign results:   Number of activities increased by 6.5% from 532 to 567   Number of twitter followers increased by 28% from 12894 to 16500   Online reach increased by 4.6% from 86.5m to 90.5m   Number of publications mentioning ECSM increased by 400% from 330 to 1655  The 2018 campaign was supported the European Commission, Europol’s Cyber Crime Centre (EC3),  European Schoolnet, SaferInternet4EU campaign and cyber security organisations from the Member  States.  Just as in previous years the concept for the European Cyber Security Month is to address disparity of  cybersecurity practices across member States in two stages. The first stage is to support the Member  States so that the awareness and behaviour of citizens in each Member State is raised to a mature level.  This becomes the reference baseline across the whole of Europe and thereby the European Cyber Security  Month aligns the risk levels across Europe. The second stage is to further lower this risk by raising the  maturity of citizen’s behaviour in unison; at the European level. ENISA and the European Commission can  achieve the objectives of the European Cyber Security Month by driving the pan-European campaign so as  to ensure all Member States are actively committed to the European Cyber Security Month and that  industry is also involved at all levels of the campaign both at the local and European level.  This report provides an overview of the activities organised and presents a synthesis of findings on the  basis of evaluation and performance information gathered via a questionnaire and media monitoring data.  The report is structured into three main parts: an introduction, the implementation phase and an  evaluation of the campaign.  The introduction will provide readers with the policy context, scope and target audience of the campaign.  The implementation phase of the report highlights the milestones that were achieved during the planning  and execution phase of the campaign.  This includes how events were organized and co-ordinated with  partners, marketing materials used and insights into the execution of the campaign including results.  The final section of the report deals with the evaluation of the campaign, comparing this year’s results with  the previous years. This year being the first year that the evaluation metrics developed in 2017 could be  ECSM 2018 Deployment Report  January 2019  06  assessed using the previous year’s base data.  Although the evaluation metrics provided some insights into  the evolution of the campaign at the MS level year on year, comparable results will only be comprehensive  and robust once all Member States are providing evaluation metrics year on year. The report concludes  with a conclusion and re-visits the future work described in the 2017 report.  Finally the report is intended to provide a basis for discussion among the Member States, the European  Commission and ENISA on how the ECSM can best be organised in the years to come. All Member States  will need to face up to similar challenges, namely how to engage citizens and organizations so as to affect  their information security behaviour.  ECSM 2018 Deployment Report  January 2019  07  2. Introduction  With some 95 % of incidents said to be enabled by \"some type of human error – intentional or not\",  there  is a strong human factor at play, making cybersecurity everyone's responsibility. This means personal,  corporate and public administration behaviour must change to ensure everybody understands the threat,  and is equipped with the tools and skills necessary to quickly detect and actively protect themselves  against attacks. People need to develop cyber hygiene habits and businesses and organisations must adopt  appropriate risk-based cybersecurity programmes and update them regularly to reflect the evolving risk  landscape.  The European Cyber Security Month (ECSM) under the coordination of ENISA is one of the mechanisms by  which cyber hygiene and awareness is promoted to the citizens of Europe.  ECSM runs for the entire month of October, with ENISA publishing new material and focusing on a  different topic each week. Along with ENISA, various stakeholders, including the private sector, academia,  the European Commission (EC) and other EU bodies, join together in a common vision by organising  activities with special focus on training, conferences, online quizzes and provide general presentations to  end users toward the establishment of an EU cyber-security culture.  This report summarises the activities carried out by ENISA and the participating MS for the 2018 campaign  and presents the evaluation and conclusions of the campaign. More importantly, it seeks to trigger a  discussion among partners with respect to improvements that can be made in the future.  Scope and Objectives  The scope of this report includes all the activities within the European Cyber Security Month (ECSM)  campaign and their impact in 2018.  The main objectives of the campaigns within ECSM 2018 were as follows:   to generate general awareness about Network and Information Security;   to educate and enhance awareness of information security and privacy;   to promote safer use of the internet for all users and the practice of basic cyber hygiene;   to stimulate awareness of cyberscams;   to build a strong track record to raise awareness through the ECSM;   to involve relevant stakeholders and increase the participation of EU Member States;   to increase national media interest through the European and international dimension of the project;   to enhance attention and interest with regard to information security through political and media  coordination.  Evaluation Methodology  In 2017, ENISA developed an evaluation strategy to guide the Agency and MS with the gathering of data  and information for the evaluation of the campaign. The same evaluation strategy was employed in 2018.  The Member State coordinators were urged to consider and define the evaluation metrics during the  planning stage of the campaign, so that the right data and information would be collected during the  execution stage.  The evaluation strategy includes both quantitative and qualitative approaches from the following sources:  ECSM 2018 Deployment Report  January 2019  08   collection of quantitative data from the MS campaign coordinators,   feedback from the MS campaign coordinators via the end of year Q&A questionnaire, and   the use of media monitoring services to gather analytical data.  An evaluation data collection form was developed by ENISA in collaboration with the Member State  coordinators for the purpose of information gathering. The evaluation form aims at extracting pertinent  information on the overall activities involved in the MS campaigns, their potential impact and includes  participants’ feedback. The evaluation form was distributed to the Member State Coordinators in the form  of an online survey, using the respective European Union platform EUSurvey  (https://ec.europa.eu/eusurvey/), and ENISA requested the Coordinators to complete it depending on  their national campaign strategy and execution. Guidelines accompanied the data collection form, that  highlight recommended metics for each type of activity.  The evaluation strategy also included a questionnaire, where the aim was to extract information on the  overall impact of the campaign based on MS campaign coordinators feedback with respect to ENISA’s  supportive role. Some of the elements assessed involve the level of support and its usefulness to MS, the  impact of promotion material used and marketing strategies followed and the role of ECSM for improving  the the outreach of MS campaigns.  Target Audience  This report is intended for organisations, either public or private, which supported the ECSM or intend to  do so in the future. The report is also of interest to IT security professionals and other target groups who  attended events and conferences organised across Europe. Further, the report targets EU national policy  makers who aim to improve the security awareness of citizens, professionals and generally IT end-users.  ECSM 2018 Deployment Report  January 2019  09  3. Planning Phase  The role of ENISA in ECSM 2018  3.1.1 Vision statement  ENISA supports the Member States with the design and implementation of their awareness raising  campaigns and to promote collaboration among EU Member States, international organizations and  industry.  3.1.2 Mission statement  ENISA’s mission for ECSM is to collaborate with the EU Member States and international organizations by  finding innovative and fun ways to raise EU citizens awareness of cybersecurity, be they by organizing  events, conferences, online quizzes, transferring of best practices or the use social media to educate and  inform the public. Our mission is to enhance the delivery and synchronize ECSM among the EU Member  States and industry that will share a pan-European vision and values for cybersecurity.  3.1.3 The Objectives for ECSM 2018  A consensus on the goals of ENISA for ECSM was reached with the participating MS. The goals that were  recognized by all MS for the Agency are as follows:   To promote the underlying value that is the foundation of ECSM:  “Cyber Security is a Shared Responsibility”   To assist the Member States in implementing ECSM activities that satisfy certain criteria: have well- defined objectives, have well-specified target audience(s) per activity, have systematically defined  cybersecurity subjects, have systematically chosen delivery channels and techniques and have well- defined effectiveness metrics   To support the Member States in defining common areas of concern for cybersecurity that are shared  and will be commonly promoted to EU citizens   To support the Member States in delivering at least one cross-border awareness raising activity among  at least three EU Member States   To support the Member States with collaboration with the private sector  ENISA supported the organisation of the European Cyber Security Month campaign in various ways, such  as:   coordinator of the organisation of ECSM;   hub for all participating MS;   collector of available material and generator of synergies between MS;   subject-matter expert on how to organise information security campaigns;   subject-matter expert on how to design the content and evaluation strategy for information security  campaigns;   facilitator of common messaging within the participating MS by providing tips and advice on how to be  safe and secure online;   creator of the ECSM brand and related marketing plan;   distributor of promotional material (infographics).  ECSM 2018 Deployment Report  January 2019  10  The Agency coordinated the organisation of the ECSM campaign, by acting as a “hub” for all participating  MS and providing suggestions, replying to enquiries and generating synergies between MS where possible.  The Agency assisted the participating MS in defining evaluation methods and metrics during the planning  phase, in order to ensure the alignment of campaign targets and evaluation approaches.  Coordination  3.2.1 Conference Calls and Meetings  ENISA maintained regular communication with the MS, in order to enhance collaboration and cooperation  amongst the MS. The Agency scheduled monthly conference calls for the MS to share their plans, receive  and provide feedback and to support in the common promotion of the pan-European campaign strategy.  The Agency prepared and distributed the meeting agenda before each conference call. Meeting minutes  where drawn up by ENISA after every call, and included a list of action points. The participation rate was  high, with an average of 12 to 15 participates per meeting.  A physical meeting was organized by ENISA and held in Brussels in February 2018. The meeting gave MS  the opportunity to discuss concerns and opportunities for improvements and finalize key areas of the  campaign, such as the themes of the month, the collaboration infrastructure and the organization and  decide on activities for the month.  3.2.2 Communication and Collaboration Technological Infrastructure  The collaboration mechanisms used for communication with MS is crucial for planning and executing the  campaign. ENISA provided three types of software tools for maintaining communication:   file repository and file exchange tools,   teleconference software and   tools for the communication and collaboration between Member State coordinators and third parties  (e.g., the private sector)  3.2.2.1 File repository and File Exchange Tools  ENISA has been utilizing Sharepoint for accessing and storing files. The file repository facilitated the work  of the MS that was previously supported with the exchange of files via email.  Some MS however cannot  access SharePoint due to security constraints.  3.2.2.2 Teleconference Software  Monthly conference calls were executed during the year in order to maintain regular contact with the MS.  The selection of the teleconference software was noted as an important decision, given that there were a  number of network and application restrictions on the side of the MS. In particular, certain tools (i.e.,  business versions, consumer versions) could not be utilised because they were restricted on the premises  or the equipment of the coordinators’ public agencies.  3.2.3 Themes of the Month  ENISA organized a workshop on Feb 2018 in Brussels and invited the Member State coordinators to  participate. The MS coordinators discussed and agreed upon the benefits of designing the MS campaigns  around commonly agreed security and privacy themes. ENISA suggested during the workshop potential  security themes and the MS discussed and debated on the most relevant and current topics based on MS  cybersecurity priorities and the state of the art challenges. Following this discussion process, the MS  gradually narrowed down the alternatives and determined four themes for the month, one theme for each  one of the weeks in October.  ECSM 2018 Deployment Report  January 2019  11  The four themes chosen:   Week 1 – Theme 1: Practice basic cyber hygiene   Week 2 – Theme 2: Expand your Digital Skills and Education   Week 3 – Theme 3: Recognize Cyberscams   Week 4 – Theme 4: Emerging Technologies and Privacy  3.2.4 Press Releases  ENISA, with the input of the European Commission, drafted a press release for the official launch of the  campaign.  The press release included an overview of the campaign and quotes from senior officials. The  press releases are translated into all the official languages of the EU and distributed to the Member State  coordinators to support their formal press release announcements.  3.2.5 Kick-Off Video  During the ECSM workshop in Brussels the decision was made to release a kick-off video rather than  organize a physical kick-off event. The MS & EFTA countries that participated in the kick-off video were  France, Finland, Germany, Luxembourg, Norway, Malta and Poland.  The video also included a message  from Mariya Gabriel EU Commissioner for Digital Economy and Society.  The process for developing the video was organized into stages.   ENISA proposed a script   MS commented on the script proposal and made necessary changes   Conference call was arranged with participating MS to finalize script   Guidelines were produced by ENISA to standardized the clips from the MS   MS chose the interviewee and formatted the prose based on the agreed upon script   Final clips including name, title and translation were sent to ENISA to compile   The clips were compiled to produce a single coherent set of messages and call to action   A teaser video was produced and released a few days before the official release of the kick-off video   The release of the official kick-off video coincided with the launch of the campaign  Evaluation Strategy  3.3.1 Evaluation Objectives  The Agency aimed to ensure that all Member State coordinators would capture information during the  execution of the awareness campaigns to enable the overall evaluation of ECSM and its impact. The  objective of the evaluation was to assess the effectiveness of the awareness activities, the attractiveness  of the activity, and its potential outreach and impact. The Agency urged the Member State Coordinators to  determine the evaluation metrics they would be using at the planning stage to ensure that they collected  the necessary data come the execution stage.  3.3.2 Evaluation Metrics  The Agency developed an evaluation strategy and a set of evaluation metrics for the Member State  Coordinators to use. The evaluation metrics were incorporated into a template evaluation form, for each  coordinator to complete upon finalisation of the execution stage. The evaluation metrics were segregated  per activity type, given that different information is relevant depending on the type of awareness  campaign.  ECSM 2018 Deployment Report  January 2019  12  Marketing Material  Both the Agency and the Member States were committed to raising awareness. A series of marketing  channels and material were used to achieve this purpose, as presented below.  3.4.1 Visual identity  The Agency created some years ago a visual identity for European Cyber Security Month including a logo1,  a colour chart, typography rules, guidelines on use of imagery, design templates and a manual of formal  guidelines on the proper use of these elements.  3.4.2 Slogan  The slogan “Cyber security is a shared responsibility!” remained unchanged in 2018.  3.4.3 Press releases  The Agency coordinated this year’s Press Release2 with the European Commission, to ensure maximum  outreach and to stimulate attention to the featured activities and events. The Press Release was translated  into all official languages of the European Union and was released on the 28th September. The services of a  media company were procured to further disseminate the press release to national and region journalists  and press across Europe.  3.4.4 Social media - banners  The Web and Social Media banners remained the  same as in the previous years.  The banner was available in four formats to match  different needs (i.e., 815x315, 1500x500, 1200x717,  1200x630).  3.4.5 Poster and Infographics  During the physical meeting in Feb in Brussels the MS discussed the different marketing options and their  impact. As a result of this discussion the MS decided not to produce posters for this year, but instead to  allocate the relevant resources for the production of a kick-off video, because of its perceived higher  impact and reach.  3.4.6 Kick-off video  A short kick-off video was produced with the support of a number of MS.  The video included a general  introduction to the campaign, core messages and a call to action.  3.4.7 Learning modules  Learning modules were created for each of the four topics for week two “Get Cyber Skilled”.  For each of  the four topics a guide was created with instructions and tips for the particular topics.  Topics:  1 https://cybersecuritymonth.eu/press-campaign-toolbox/visual-identity  2 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/news/enisa-news/cybersecurity-is-a-shared-responsibility-2018-european-cyber- security-month-kicks-off  Figure 1: ECSM 2018 social media banner.  ECSM 2018 Deployment Report  January 2019  13   Password management   Backing up data   Privacy settings   Protecting against social engineering  3.4.8 Toolkit for learning modules  A toolkit for week two was developed for the purpose of promoting the modules produced for week two  campaign “Get Cyber Skilled”. This included a long and short copy, quotes from senior officials, core  messages and cybersecurity tips.  3.4.9 Website  The material on the ECSM website3 was re-organized including the tabs on the home page so as to  enhance the accessibility of the website.  During week 2 for the theme Get Cyber Skilled the landing page was altered to promote the theme during  the month as the graphic below demonstrates.  3.4.10 NIS Quiz  The NIS Quiz was not updated in 2018. It was decided at the ECSM meeting in February that the NIS Quiz  would not be enhanced in favour for other activities.

Themes of the month  Overview of the themes for 2018:  Week 1 – Theme 1: Practice basic cyber hygiene  ENISA and APWG designed a phishing poster for the first week of the campaign. The phishing poster  provided information about the scale of the phishing problem by numbers, tips on how to avoid phishing  and what to do if one becomes a victim of phishing.  Week 2 – Theme 2: Expand your Digital Skills and Education  The Get Cyber Skills campaign was launched on Monday 8th October.  ECSM learning modules were created  for the campaign with European Schoolnet (under a service contract with the EC for delivering the Better  Internet for Kids core service platform and coordination of the Insafe network of Safer Internet Centres in  Europe); and as part of the #SaferInternet4EU campaign launched on Safer Internet Day (SID) 2018 by  Commissioner Mariya Gabriel to promote online safety, media literacy and cyber hygiene. This initiative  stems from the Digital Education Action Plan and sets out a series of initiatives to support citizens,  educational institutions and education systems to better adapt for life and work in an age of rapid digital  change.  4 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWNUHaxensE&t=1s  5 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZlxR6nBYCLM&t=97s  ECSM 2018 Deployment Report  January 2019  16  Key message of the campaign –  Advancing cybersecurity skills and education of younger generations as an important means for keeping  themselves and others safe.  Just like the physical world there are threats online that could pose a danger  to children and young adults physically, emotionally and financially. Building cybersecurity skills and  competences helps the younger generation to develop routine cyber hygiene practices which they can  then transfer to others and help protect society.  The target audience for Get Cyber Skilled campaign were parents, teachers, guardians, role models and  community leaders responsible for developing cybersecurity education and skills in young people.  As part of the campaign, four ECSM learning modules were developed to help you create a study plan for  your class. Topics include:   Password management6   Backing up data7   Privacy settings8   Protecting against social engineering9  The campaign included a toolkit10 to help partners and Member States support with the outreach of the  campaign.  Week 3 – Theme 3: Recognize Cyber Scams  The theme aimed at educating the general public on how to identify deceiving content in order to keep  both themselves and their finances safe online.  The internet has become very attractive for cybercriminals. Attackers are using sophisticated tricks and  promises to wrench money or valuable financial information out of users. Scams featuring a long-lost  deceased relative or Nigerian princes are not the only tricks in the book anymore. The tactics used by  cybercriminals are becoming increasingly innovative and harder to detect. From pretending to be the  CEO of your organisation to impersonating a romantic interest, the online scammers of today will do what  it takes to get what they want –money and/or banking credentials.  6 https://cybersecuritymonth.eu/get-cyber-skilled/education-modules/education-modules/what-is-a- password-and-why-is-it-important  7 https://cybersecuritymonth.eu/get-cyber-skilled/education-modules/education-modules/what-is- backup-and-why-is-it-important  8 https://cybersecuritymonth.eu/get-cyber-skilled/education-modules/education-modules/what-is-social- enjineering-and-why-is-it-a-threat  9 https://cybersecuritymonth.eu/get-cyber-skilled/education-modules/education-modules/what-is-social- enjineering-and-why-is-it-a-threat  10 https://cybersecuritymonth.eu/get-cyber-skilled/partner-pack  https://cybersecuritymonth.eu/get-cyber-skilled/education-modules/education-modules/what-is-a-password-and-why-is-it-important https://cybersecuritymonth.eu/get-cyber-skilled/education-modules/education-modules/what-is-a-password-and-why-is-it-important https://cybersecuritymonth.eu/get-cyber-skilled/education-modules/education-modules/what-is-backup-and-why-is-it-important https://cybersecuritymonth.eu/get-cyber-skilled/education-modules/education-modules/what-is-backup-and-why-is-it-important https://cybersecuritymonth.eu/get-cyber-skilled/education-modules/education-modules/what-is-social-enjineering-and-why-is-it-a-threat https://cybersecuritymonth.eu/get-cyber-skilled/education-modules/education-modules/what-is-social-enjineering-and-why-is-it-a-threat https://cybersecuritymonth.eu/get-cyber-skilled/education-modules/education-modules/what-is-social-enjineering-and-why-is-it-a-threat https://cybersecuritymonth.eu/get-cyber-skilled/education-modules/education-modules/what-is-social-enjineering-and-why-is-it-a-threat https://cybersecuritymonth.eu/get-cyber-skilled/partner-pack  ECSM 2018 Deployment Report  January 2019  17  As such, Europol and the European Banking Federation launched an awareness campaign on the 7 most  common online financial scams.  Europol’s European Cybercrime Centre (EC3), the European Banking Federation and their partners from  the public and private sector participated in the campaign and included the #CyberScams awareness  campaign as part of the European Cyber Security Month.  Law enforcement agencies from all 28 EU Member States, 5 non- EU Member States, 24 national banking  associations and banks and many other cybercrime fighters raised awareness about this criminal  phenomenon.  This pan-European endeavour was driven by a communication campaign and national law  enforcement, bank associations and financial institutions that was communicated via social media  channels.  For this campaign, awareness-raising material was developed in 27 languages, available for public  download, which includes information on the 7 most common online financial scams, and how to avoid  them:   CEO fraud: scammers pretend to be your CEO or senior representative in the organisation and trick  you into paying a fake invoice or making an unauthorised transfer out of the business account.   Invoice fraud: they pretend to be one of your clients/suppliers and trick you into paying future invoices  into a different bank account.   Phishing/Smishing/Vishing: they call you, send you a text message or an email to trick you into sharing  your personal, financial or security information.   Spoofed bank website fraud: they use bank phishing emails with a link to the spoofed website. Once  you click on the link, various methods are used to collect your financial and personal information. The  site will look like its legitimate counterpart, with small differences.   Romance scam: they pretend to be interested in a romantic relationship. It commonly takes place on  online dating websites, but scammers often use social media or email to make contact.   Personal data theft: they harvest your personal information via social media channels.   Investment and online shopping scams: they make you think you are on a smart investment… or  present you with a great fake online offer.  Week 4 – Theme 4: Emerging Technologies and Privacy  Stay tech wise and safe with the latest emerging technologies.  The plan for week 4 of the campaign included a live webinar by ENISA experts and external experts from  Industry with the purpose of discussing the importance of having an “Emerging Technologies Horizon  Scanning and Research Process”, however the activity was postponed to a later date.

https://cybersecuritymonth.eu/get-cyber-skilled/education-modules  ECSM 2018 Deployment Report  January 2019  23  4.3.3 Estonia  The CERT of the Estonian Information System Authority (RIA) decided this year to celebrate the October  cyber security month by conducting small cyber-hygiene events all around Estonia. In addition to the  employees of RIA we invited our partners from other government offices, schools and private companies  (e.g., cyber security enterprises) to seek out potential local community audiences and talk to them about  basic cyber hygiene.  This sort of action of mobilizing people around a communal project in their own communities has a long  history in Estonia. Traditionally this has been an agricultural undertaking, for example the harvesting of  potatoes. This is called “talgud” in Estonian. This year we decided to have “talgud” in the field of cyber  security, where everyone who is able, could participate in their own communities.  The Cyber Security Month “talgud” event or roadshow started with an invitation. We invited schools, local  libraries, general practitioners of medicine and other entities to sign up to these “talgud” – essentially  inviting someone to come to talk about the importance of cyber hygiene. Then we assigned volunteer  experts to the places. Altogether, about 30 people (half of them from RIA and half from our partner  organizations) visited about 30 places on October 15th (with a couple of exceptions).  Among the offices where our experts went were:   the staff of the Estonian parliament;   two news organizations,   schools and school-related organizations (school libraries, teacher assemblies, etc) and   health centers.  Volunteer experts also called up their own childhood schools or health centers, where they visited the  healthcare personnel and offered free trainings.  Among the volunteers were cyber security experts from RIA, experts from other government offices,  employees and owners of private cyber security companies, diplomats and lawyers. In every part of the  “talgud”, the volunteers were aided by leaflets and other materials provided by CERT-EE.  4.3.4 Finland  National Cyber Security Centre in Finland had two national online campaigns with social media activities  during ECSM 2018. We also participated in the Cyber Security Nordic Conference and Exhibition with the  Finnish Security Committee and Population Register Centre 10.- 11.10.2018.  We were active during #CyberScam-week also and took part in national cyber scam campaign with Finnish  Police and Finance Finland (FFI) mainly in Twitter and Facebook.  We started ECSM month with our national password campaign \"The longer the better\". A password needs  to be long enough, and it should not be too simple. We encouraged citizens to change their password to  something safer.  Here's our #thelongerthebetter password video:   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7CVFv18ldw   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJq92PlHCC0 (Swedish version)  The videos were kind of overture to our main national campaign which started 8 November. The campaign  ended during the first week of November.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7CVFv18ldw https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJq92PlHCC0  ECSM 2018 Deployment Report  January 2019  24  The main character of Finland's national cyber security campaign was a middle aged man called “Teijo”  who is very excited, and especially about passwords, backups and updates. He was very keen on giving  advice about these themes to his colleagues at his workplace. Teijo also spread around cyber security  themed aphorisms - #securisms - like \"Life is short, password long\" or \"Hard work calls for hard updates\".  We made three “1 minute” videos (in Finnish, with Finnish subtitles)   Teijo and passwords  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JXX9fm8P_20&list=PLcYs3a0AMHVl4VDNc56rybJtNFymTknUA&in dex=2   Teijo and backups  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rmhiPZ4j5sM&list=PLcYs3a0AMHVl4VDNc56rybJtNFymTknUA   Teijo and updates  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mj_6XX6GpbM&  Humourous and carefully made video scripts with clear main messages were the keys to our campaigns’  success. Our strategy was not to try to say or teach everybody, everything at the same time. We support a  “No more than 3 messages” approach. Hence, we focused on passwords, backups and updates.  4.3.5 France  The 6th edition of ECSM campaign was coordinated at the national level by ANSSI, the national authority  for cybersecurity and cyberdefence, in France. The program of the campaign was ambitious, aiming to  raise awareness and provide advice and recommendations in both the work place and at home.  For this year’s campaign, ANSSI, the national authority on cybersecurity and cyberdefence, worked  alongside more than 20 institutional partners (ministries, association, non-profit organisation, national  authorities, etc.) to build the national program all through October, focusing on the themes defined at the  European level as well as the motto “Cybersecurity is a shared responsibility!’.  More than 80 activities were organized in France during the month. These activities involved:   Conferences and workshops on cybersecurity issues for various events and audiences (companies,  students, and administrations) hosted by the national ECSC partners such as ANSSI, the regional  Chambers of Commerce and Industry, prefecture, etc.   An active awareness campaign online, sharing tips and good practices all through the month with the  #ECSM and #TousSecNum. The idea was to shed light onto the existing cybersecurity tool kit that  includes infographics, videos, etc.   Original activities :   First French participation to the European cybersecurity challenge (14th – 17th October) – a great  event to promote cybersecurity skills and training (theme n°2)   The collaboration with a French cartoonist, Fix, to use humor and art as a way to raise awareness  about cybersecurity. The cartoons were translated in English (subtitles). It also led to a common  promotion of ANSSI (France) and BSI (Germany) productions on twitter.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JXX9fm8P_20&list=PLcYs3a0AMHVl4VDNc56rybJtNFymTknUA&index=2 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JXX9fm8P_20&list=PLcYs3a0AMHVl4VDNc56rybJtNFymTknUA&index=2 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rmhiPZ4j5sM&list=PLcYs3a0AMHVl4VDNc56rybJtNFymTknUA https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mj_6XX6GpbM&  ECSM 2018 Deployment Report  January 2019  25  Figure 2: Funny Cartoon Images used in the French Campaign to Promote Cyber Security Awareness  To promote ECSM messages and activities, a communication plan was defined by ANSSI and its partners  including:   Participation of the Secretary of States for digital Affairs, M. Mounir Mahjoubi to the kick-off European  video   Creation of a dedicated webpage on ANSSI’s website to promote the ECSM activities :  https://www.ssi.gouv.fr/agence/cybersecurite/mois-de-la-cybersecurite-2018/   Diffusion of a dedicated press release   Regular publications on partners’ website and social networks about ECSM, both in French and English  (statistics to be consolidated)   Creation of banners created for this 2018 edition to call people to take action and be part of ECSM on  their social networks and website, using a communication kit.  4.3.6 Germany  The 6th edition of ECSM campaign was coordinated at the national level by BSI, the Federal Office for  Information Security, in Germany.  General  In general, 192 events and local campaigns have taken place in Germany as part of the ECSM  Cybersecmonth 2018. The BSI gained 104 partners, among them state ministries, criminal investigation  departments, chambers of industry and commerce, associations, medias, enterprises and others.  Moreover the BSI was focussing on Practice Basic Cyber Hygiene at home and at work.  Press  https://www.ssi.gouv.fr/agence/cybersecurite/mois-de-la-cybersecurite-2018/  ECSM 2018 Deployment Report  January 2019  26  BSI published a press release11 on the first of October. At the start of the ECSM a graphic visualising a  \"smart home\" with four rooms was published on the website12. Each room contained one digital device.  Each week one room \"opened\" (as it turned from grey to coloured) and another digital device was the  central theme for tips around IT-security at home. Within this topic the BSI presented facts and  recommendations for more security around: router, computer, smartphone and IoT devices.  Figure 3: \"Is your smart home secure?\" - from the German ECSM Campaign  Social media  The BSI released four Facebook polls asking: \"Be honest, how good is your cyber hygiene?\"   First week: Did you changed the password, when you first installed your router?   Second week: Do you immediately install updates when available?   Third week: Which kind of access authorisation do you permit your app?   Fourth week: Do you know exactly what kind of data is stored by your wearable device?  Additionally the BSI published an awareness-video. Its central question is: Do you really have nothing to  hide?' The advice and answer is: 'Take cyber security seriously to protect your privacy!'  11 https://www.bsi.bund.de/DE/Presse/Pressemitteilungen/Presse2018/ECSM‐Start_01102018.html  12 https://www.bsi-fuer-buerger.de/BSIFB/DE/Service/Aktuell/Informationen/Artikel/basisschutz_fuer_den_router.html  https://www.bsi.bund.de/DE/Presse/Pressemitteilungen/Presse2018/ECSM-Start_01102018.html https://www.bsi-fuer-buerger.de/BSIFB/DE/Service/Aktuell/Informationen/Artikel/basisschutz_fuer_den_router.html  ECSM 2018 Deployment Report  January 2019  27  Furthermore the BSI intensified Social Media interactions with Europol, France, Belgie, Luxemburg and  Sweden within Facebook and Twitter to show European ECSM actions in the BSI channels.  Events  The BSI organised a workshop to discuss opportunities and risks around the internet of things. During the  event an illustrator painted an infographic containing all the ideas and input by the participants13.  Figure 4: Risks and Opportunities along with IoT – from the German ECSM Campaign  Network  The BSI channel for economics distributed four illustrations14 to raise awareness for cyber security among  enterprises, organisations and institutions. The visuals were shared with the hashtag #ecsm by these  partners and the BSI Twitter channels.  13 https://www.bsi.bund.de/SharedDocs/Videos/DE/BSI/Interviews/IoT‐workshop‐bsi‐2018‐10‐25  14 https://www.allianz‐fuer‐cybersicherheit.de/ACS/DE/Micro/Awareness/awareness_node.html  https://www.bsi.bund.de/SharedDocs/Videos/DE/BSI/Interviews/IoT-workshop-bsi-2018-10-25 https://www.allianz-fuer-cybersicherheit.de/ACS/DE/Micro/Awareness/awareness_node.html  ECSM 2018 Deployment Report  January 2019  28  Figure 5: Key-Passwords in Cyber Security - from the German ECSM Campaign  Intern  Last but not least the BSI promoted the ECSM in the BSI-Intranet by informing employees about cyber risks  day-by-day for one week. In the end employees were invited to take part in a quiz.  4.3.7 Hungary  In Hungary, ESCM2018 awareness campaign was coordinated by the National Cyber Security Center (NCSC  Hungary).  The objective of the Hungarian campaign was to raise awareness for the Hungarian citizens (for several  different groups and of different ages) about the main cybersecurity related topics, and to create better  cooperation and professional discussions about the new cyber security trends and challenges.  Figure 6: About Phishing-Mails and Counter Protection - from the German ECSM Campaign  ECSM 2018 Deployment Report  January 2019  29  As a campaign coordinator, NCSC-Hungary and its 25 campaign partners organised 34 different types of  events or campaign elements (for example online campaign) between 28th September and 8th of  November.  During the campaign there was a great variety of events in the programme: there were several  conferences in different topics, awareness lessons at elementary schools, round table discussions, carrier  discussions, cyber challenges for university students, cybersecurity “quiz shows”, cybersecurity escape  rooms, university conferences, poster competitions and exhibitions, online campaigns etc.  To promote the ECSM campaign, the events, and the messages we used several communicational channels  and awareness techniques:   NCSC-Hungary created a website for the Hungarian ECSM campaign, where people can find info about  the EU campaign, the Hungarian elements, events, posters and awareness materials, partners, photos  about the evets and a cybersecurity online quiz also:  https://kiberhonap.hu/   NCSC- Hungary created a dedicated Facebook account for the ECSM in Hungary, where we posted the  ECSM events, awareness materials, posters, videos and interesting articles about the ECSM topics:  @Kiberhónap Magyarország   NCSC-Hungary, Hungarian Police and the Hungarian Banking Association held a common press  conference about phishing campaigns   NCSC-Hungary organized a kickoff event, the Cybersec 2018.hu conference on 2th of October that has  audience from the public and private sector and from the academia also.   NCSC Hungary created a cybersecurity online quiz ( 2 level:1 for general users and for IT security  experts)   NCSC-Hungary created 2 Hungarian poster about the ECSM2018 campaign.  Figure 7: Posters on Cyber Security Awareness from the Hungarian ECSM Campaign  https://kiberhonap.hu/  ECSM 2018 Deployment Report  January 2019  30  4.3.8 Luxembourg  In Luxembourg, the ECSM activities 2018 were carried out by 5 local partners, coordinated by the Ministry  of the Economy. Partners this year were the Luxembourg Bankers’ Association (ABBL); the national  initiative for promoting a safer internet (BEE SECURE); the national Police; RESTENA CSIRT/UNI LU, and  Security made in Lëtzebuerg - the national portal for promoting information security and the cybersecurity  ecosystem.  Figure 8: Luxembourgish ECSM Campaign Banner  National activities included:   social media posts   a landing page for the Europol “cyber scams” campaign (see also here)   Translation into Luxembourgish of the Europol information material   a national awareness campaign on online relationships   a cyber-day at University of Luxembourg campus,   a dedicated Luxembourg cybersecurity week (15-20 October), with over 25 events including a Gala  Awards evening  While all of the activities (gathering an estimated total of over 2000 participants) covered this year’s ECSM  topics, two of them specifically reached out to women in the cyber world. The Gala Awards evening (200  attendees) included a special address by Mariya Gabriel, EU Commissioner for Digital Economy and  Society, and the presence of Mrs Despina Spanou, Director for Digital society, trust and cybersecurity at  the EU Commission. Six awards were distributed: CISO of the Year; Best Inclusion Initiative; Most Promising  Cybersecurity Solution (Jury’s choice and people’s choice); Best Talk; Most Promising Young Talent.  https://www.abbl.lu/2018/10/17/cyber-security-luxembourg-mobilises-to-raise-public-awareness/ https://police.public.lu/fr/actualites/2018/10/w42/17-cyberscams.html https://www.bee-secure.lu/fr/campagnes/love-stories-40 https://wwwde.uni.lu/universitaet/aktuelles/termine/conference_cyberday_2018 https://cybersecurityweek.lu/  ECSM 2018 Deployment Report  January 2019  31  Figure 9: Cyber Security Awareness Event in Luxembourg – Gala e-Awards Night  “Be Cyber Aware”, an internal EC staff awareness raising initiative of the European Commission DG DIGIT,  organised their “IT security day” in Luxembourg during the ECSM, with the possibility of a closer  partnership in the future.  At national press level, 2 press releases were send out by the ministry of the Economy and articles were  published in 6 local magazines/newspapers (It nation; Paperjam; Silicon; Beast; Itone and Merkur).  In view of the growing success of the “Luxembourg week” within the ECSM, we may consider extending  the focus, from 1 to 2 weeks for the next edition.  All in all, the October month in Luxembourg contributed to increase the interest in cybersecurity with the  public at large, raising visibility of public and private actors in charge, as well as to position Luxembourg as  a key European player in cybersecurity.  4.3.9 Malta  During the European Cyber Security Month, Malta launched its second national awareness campaign for  the coming years. This campaign intends to focus further on awareness and education in cyber security  within various sectors of Maltese society. The Campaign was officially launched on Tuesday 16th October  during an event held at Fort Sant’ Angelo, Birgu with keynote speakers being the Minister for Home Affairs  and National Security, the Parliamentary Secretary for Financial Services, Digital Economy and Innovation,  the ENISA Director, the Executive Chairman as well as the Head of Information Security and Governance of  MITA – the Government IT Agency responsible for its implementation. Key stakeholders from the public  and private sector were invited. The launch also led to the rollout of a new Website on Cyber Security as  well as social media channels including Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and YouTube, apart from further use  of traditional media such as radio, TV, newspapers and street advertising.  A ‘Capture the Flag’ Hackathon event – Malta Cyber Crusades 2018 was also held on 26th and 27th October,  as a means to attract individuals towards cyber security skills uptake. It was open for individuals over 17  years of age. Over 40 persons, including students from tertiary institutions participated. This was the first  of its kind held by MITA. Nonetheless a number of lessons learnt were taken note of for future  considerations. They included further promotion prior to the event, further detailed training to beginners  ECSM 2018 Deployment Report  January 2019  32  prior to the actual challenge, and prize categories for those already having expertise and those who are  still beginners in such cyber security challenges.  Focus group sessions, in collaboration with Maltese SME representative bodies were also held on the 17th,  23rd and 26th October respectively. Such sessions served as a means to understand better the cyber  security concerns and experiences amongst SMES and on ways of how related awareness can be reached  to them more effectively. Amongst the lessons learnt were the need of other similar interactive or  collaborative measures in the future as means for SMES to share knowledge and experience on cyber  security, including awareness.  4.3.10 Norway  This year was the sixth time, The Norwegian Center for Information Security (NorSIS) has been the national  coordinator for the National Security Month in Norway.  We have made a few changes this year, which we believe have been very successful. One of our changes is  the broadening of our target group. Since our previous efforts and focusing on reaching small and medium  sizes businesses, this time we have also been targeting the general population and larger businesses as  well.  Although ENISA’s campaign has four themes, we decided to concentrate on two themes, that is, “fake  email” and “online fraud”. This is on the basis of feedback from previous Norwegian campaigns.  Actions and activities  We kicked off the Norwegian Cyber Security Month with a free conference in Oslo the 27th of September.  There were about 200 participants at the conference and about 100 people who followed the streaming of  it on YouTube.  Our main effort and contribution to the campaign was the same this year as earlier years. The  development, project managing and distribution of a security training kit for companies. This kit contains a  presentation that managers are encouraged to hold for their employees in order to motivate them to  follow an e-learning course on cyber security, also provided in the kit. The e-learning consists of 8 modules  that take about 3-5 minutes to complete. Furthermore, the training package consists of films, brochures  and other materials that managers can distribute in the office and among the employees to create  awareness with regards to information and cyber security.  This year’s e-learning reached 365 businesses with a total of 256,144 employees. This is a new record in  reach which we are very pleased with. Part of this success may be because we have used a new e-learning  provider this year. This has given us new opportunities for reaching larger businesses with the training kit.  There is however a challenge with low figures for completion of the e-learning that we will need to address  in next year’s campaign.  In order to reach the Norwegian population with our messages about information and cyber security, we  developed an e-learning course directed at the population. This course was launched on nettvett.no. The  course intends to reveal attempts of social manipulation, ransomware, phishing and other types of fraud.  Furthermore, it aims at helping the public to reveal fake contests and fake news in social media, teach  them what to consider before sharing photos and videos online, securing their computers and mobile  phones and detect fake emails.  In addition to the training kit, we facilitated a national lecture effort. Experts in information and cyber  security donated their time and themed lectures as a contribution to the campaign. This is published on a  ECSM 2018 Deployment Report  January 2019  33  website from which businesses can book lectures to educate and inspire their employees with people who  daily work with information security at different kind of levels.  Creating awareness in social media has been a natural part of this year’s campaign, for our core messages  and advertising the training kit as well as supporting other efforts. One such initiative was the National  Criminal Investigation Service (NCIS) with the spread of Europol's Cyberscam campaign in social Medias.  The campaign was well made and a success in terms of sharing and reach in social media.  Finally, in addition to NorSIS’s contribution, a number of experts, businesses, organisations and others  have arranged, coordinated and participated at a number of conferences, meetings and seminars  throughout the country in order to bring forward the message of “cybersecurity is a shared responsibility”.  We look forward to continuing this work throughout the year of October 2019. We would like to take this  opportunity to thank ENISA for your role and efforts in coordinating the European Cyber Security Month.  We look forward to working with you on next year´s campaign.  4.3.11 Poland  European Cybersecurity Month in Poland is coordinated by NASK National Research Institute. The  campaign has been organized for the sixth time but for the first time with such a flourish. A total of 45  initiatives has been reported and organized with cooperation of 30 partners and 7 honorary patrons: Prime  Minister, Minister of Digitalization, National Security Bureau, Ministry of Science and Higher Education,  Ministry of National Education, Ministry of Entrepreneurship and Technology, and Ministry of Health. The  campaign started with the Kick-off event on 1st of October.  Inauguration was an open event which took place in \"Przestrzeń from Facebook\" with presence of 90  guests: partners, representatives of administration, academy, business, NGO's, media and citizens.  During the ECSM celebrations in Poland, a total of 45 cyber security initiatives and events took place. Some  of them has been organized by NASK, some with cooperation with partners or partners alone. The main  goal was to spread the information about ECSM campaign to the wide audience and this is why the  initiatives were addressed to different target groups: professionals, children and adults, essential services  providers, public administration and digital services providers.  There were thematic conferences, experts  meetings, workshops for children and youth, school activities, information campaigns and educational  materials, open movies shows.  ECSM campaign was supported by communication held on the website www.bezpiecznymiesiac.pl -  visited in October over 16,7 thousand times, which is a 75% of increase in comparison to previous year. For  the first time ECSM in Poland was also present in social media. Thanks to the cooperation with Facebook,  1800 people socjety has been build on Facebook.  The campaign was also present on Twitter. Below are links to the ECSM social media:  - https://www.facebook.com/ECSMPL/  - https://twitter.com/EcsmPolska  The summary of all activities is presented on the NASK website and social media channel.  Some graphics produced for the campaign:  ECSM 2018 Deployment Report  January 2019  34  ECSM 2018 Deployment Report  January 2019  35  4.3.12 Portugal  The Portuguese National Cybersecurity Center (CNCS), the national point of contact with ENISA and in  charge of raising awareness on cyber security, in 2018, similarly to previous years, carried out an  awareness campaign within the scope of ECSM, which included offline activities - conferences, workshops,  talks, awareness podcasts on radio programs and other initiatives - and online - cybersecurity tips, through  the publication of posters, videos and posts on CNCS media channels.  In order to carry out this campaign, the CNCS had the involvement of national partners from different  sectors - education, health, media, academia, industry, IT associations - without which it would be difficult  to reach so many people.  The effort to convey the message that cybersecurity is a shared responsibility had positive outputs this  year, leading to the increase of the number of CNCS partners to carry out these initiatives, as well as to the  number of initiatives (in 2017 we have carried out 12 initiatives with 6 partners and in 2018 the number of  initiatives increased to 40, 23 of them being organized by basic schools, and the number of partners  increased to 40, being 23 of them schools). These activities were carried out in 30 cities or localities,  distributed throughout the country, in addition to the awareness initiatives carried out online by CNCS and  its partners.  ECSM 2018 Deployment Report  January 2019  36  It was found that the dissemination materials available on the ECSM website and the sharing of the  materials and information about campaigns that were being carried out by other countries were very  useful and served as inspiration for activities and initiatives in other countries or places.  4.3.13 Romania  This year’s ECSM 2018 campaign in Romania, we focused more than ever on social media interaction with  common users. Some of our main activities involved:   Social media cybersecurity awareness campaign (Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Instagram, YouTube).   On CERT-RO and partners social media channels we scheduled 3 to 4 daily posts on ECSM 2018 main  themes.   Fostering new public-private partnerships, with organizations very much interested in cyber security  awareness campaigns   Partnership with Digital Nation for FREE one month vouchers for cyber security course (12 months) if  users sign in during ECSM2018 campaign.   Partnership during ECSM2018 with PentestTools.com for FREE 250 credits that could enable users to  do multiple testing of their website security.   Ask me Anything campaign with CERT-RO team in the last day of the campaign on Reddit (r/Romania)   Like every year, we managed to have a cyber security course for influencers (journalists) during  ECSM2018.   Support for other campaigns during the month of October: CodeWeek, CodeKids, Safety in Online  (highschool campaign).   Support and direct involvement in the process of selection and training of Romania Team for European  Cyber Security Championship 2018   Cyber Security exercises: CyDex2018 (national cyber security exercise in Romania).   The CERT-RO annual international conference on cyber security during the month of October. The  event has always been part of the ECSM calendar of events in Romania.   Support for Europol and EBF campaign against online fraud on all channels.   TV news pieces regarding pressing cyber security issues and ongoing campaigns against RO common  users in online: vishing, phishing, scam.  Some Issues that we identified with respect to the ECSM calendar for editing by CERT-RO. In this context,  we found a great dependency on ENISA for any encountered issues, also in order to change info on events.  A higher control over what is published over Romanian events is recommended in the future.  Some additional remarks include that we need more materials that are formulated with a clear message.  We think that the materials provided by Europol are a great example in that direction. Also, we support  more video/gif materials for users. People are less inclined to read and social media is much happier to  push multimedia content on their channels. Organic reach could get much bigger this way.  4.3.14 Spain  In the light of the Cyber Security Month campaign, Spain organized a set of activities to promote  awareness and culture in cybersecurity.  There were several Organisms involved: Guardia Civil, National Police, National Institute for Cybersecurity  (INCIBE), National Cryptologic Centre (CCN), National Security Department, … Regarding the private sector,  there were many events and actions focused on that.  ECSM 2018 Deployment Report  January 2019  37  All these Organisms and Companies spread information by using their communications channels (webs,  social networks, etc.).  The most important event on October has been ENISE (12TH edition of the International Meeting on  Information Security, organized by the National Institute for Cybersecurity -INCIBE-), the major conference  on Information Security that gather top experts, investors and stakeholders in the sector, where more than  1.000 people attended.  The media content produced by Europol and financial sector, in collaboration with Law Enforcement  Agencies, delivered during the 3rd week (focused on Cyber Scams) was useful, and this model (making  resources in collaboration with European agencies), could be extended to the rest of activities.  Finally, is very welcome the initiative from ENISA for this year’s ECSM, according to which a National  Coordinator can approve, modify or deny the events before they are published at the ECSM website’s  portal.  ECSM 2018 Deployment Report  January 2019  38  5. Evaluation  Assessment of Implemented Actions based on the Evaluation Methodology  The evaluation metrics are a useful tool for collecting consistent information from MS coordinators  regarding the activities that they implemented during the ECSM. Given the different nature of the variant  ECSM activities, the evaluation methodology defined different metrics per type of activity. The following  categories of activities were identified and accompanied by respective metrics:   Conference/ Workshop activities   TV or Radio Advertisement activities   ECSM Website   Social Media Activities   Fair Stand/ Exhibition and Roadshows   Merchandising, Posters, Leaflets   Tests/Quizzes   ECSM Organization Effort  The following Member States, provided data for 2018:   Belgium   Bulgaria   Estonia   Finland   Germany   Hungary   Luxembourg   Malta   Poland   Portugal   Romania  The following Member States and EFTA countries, provided data for 2017, the base year of the evaluation:   Czech Republic   Germany   Latvia   Luxembourg   Norway   Poland   Slovenia  ECSM 2018 Deployment Report  January 2019  39  5.1.1 Results for Conference/ Workshop activities  The following figures demonstrate the average number of activities per MS with regards to the  organization of conferences and workshops for 2017 and 2018.  On average MS organized more events in 2018 compared to 2017, however the duration of the events  were maintained year on year.  The main target groups for MS were either General Users or Professional Users. The number of attendees  decreased compared to 2017, which may be the outcome of more targeted audience groups. The security  themes covered in conferences organized in 2018 included subjects such as IoT, Practice Basic Cyber  Hygiene, Expand your Digital Skills and Education, Recognise Cyber Scams, Cyber security training, and  Emerging Technologies and Privacy. Feedback from attendees was positive. Remarks highlighted that the  attendees favoured activities that included greater interaction (e.g., Capture the Flag, interactive sessions)  and appreciated targeted content and training.  5.1.2 Results for TV or Radio Advertisement activities  0  2  4  2017 2018  Average Figures per MS on  Organized Conferences  Average number of organized conferences per MS  Average Duration (Days) of conferences per MS  0  500  1000  2017 2018  Average Number of Attendees in  conferences per MS  ECSM 2018 Deployment Report  January 2019  40  Overall only few countries implemented TV or radio advertisements in 2018.

Average bounce rate and time visitors spent per MS  website increased year on year.  5.1.4 Results for Social Media Activities  ECSM activities employed by Facebook accounts are widely popular. The figures displayed above represent  the activities that took place during October 2018 for MS related accounts and posts. On average the MS  coordinators reduced the paid Facebook activities, while maintaining same amount of Followers, Likes and  Shares, with 2017.  0  1  2  3  2017 2018  Average Bounce Rate per MS website  Average time visitors spent (minutes) per MS website  0  10000  20000  30000  40000  50000  60000  Average Number of 'Likes' per  post per MS  Average Number of 'Shares' for posts per  MS  Average Number of Followers  per MS  Average Organic  Reach per MS  Average Paid Reach  per MS  Average Total Reach  per MS  Facebook Activities  2017 2018  ECSM 2018 Deployment Report  January 2019  42  Twitter activities were more effective in 2018 and contributed to the activities with almost 5000 average  number of followers per MS, and 12 retweets on average per post.  0  5  10  15  2017 2018  Average Number of Retweets per  MS  0  2000  4000  6000  2017 2018  Average Number of Followers per  MS  0  100  200  300  400  500  600  700  2017 2018  Average Number of videos' views  per MS  ECSM 2018 Deployment Report  January 2019  43  Finally some countries used YouTube channels and videos demonstrating an average number of almost  700 views per video.  5.1.5 Fair Stand/ Exhibition and Roadshows  0  2  4  6  8  2017 2018  Average view duration (minutes) per  MS  0  2  4  6  8  10  2017 2018  Average Number of events per MS  Average Number of Locations visited per MS  0  500  1000  1500  2000  2500  3000  Average Number of event visitors  Average Number of ECSM booth visitors  Average Cost  2017 2018  ECSM 2018 Deployment Report  January 2019  44  5.1.6 Merchandising, Posters, Leaflets  5.1.7 Tests/Quizzes  The implementation of Tests/Quizzed was less frequent in 2018. Belgium implemented a Quiz, which was  taken by 15000 individuals. Hungary also implemented a Quiz which was taken by 334 individuals.  5.1.8 Organizational effort  The participating MS reported that at least one full time employee in their organization worked on the  preparation and execution of ECSM 2018; one to three employees were occupied in the planning and  execution, with average 55 person days fully dedicated.  5.1.9 Overall results and conclusions  The assessment included in this chapter represents the first attempt in ECSM for a systematic and  comparative analysis of the ECSM activities across the Member States. ENISA developed an evaluation  strategy which was communicated and agreed among the MS coordinators. The objective of this effort is  to collect adequate information from the MS coordinators regarding the activities they organize during  ECSM each year and analyse them to produce useful findings for the future ECSM organizations.  0  2000  4000  6000  8000  10000  12000  2017 2018  Average Number of Units per MS Average Cost per MS  0  5  10  15  20  25  30  2017 2018  Average Number of Locations targeted  per MS  ECSM 2018 Deployment Report  January 2019  45  This report includes the analysis of the data for 2017 and 2018, with a perspective on the average  measures per Member State participating. The findings are divided per category of activity. Regarding the  organization of conferences and workshops within ECSM, the results showed an increased number of  activities in 2018 compared to 2017 and a decreased average number of attendees; the data reflects a  different approach by the MS coordinators to organize smaller events with targeted audience groups  compared to 2017 in which larger events were organized for more general audience. Further, there was a  significant increase on the use of advertisements in 2018 (the average number of advertisements per MS  was increased four times). Similarly, the activities of roadshows, fair stands and exhibitions were  significantly increased in 2018 in terms of number of visited events, visited locations, and reach. The  impact of the activities through websites, Facebook and YouTube was relatively the same. LinkedIn was  not popular in both periods. On the other hand, Tweeter activities were boosted in 2018 with increased  number of followers and retweets. Finally, MS coordinators reported that it is difficult to estimate the cost  of organization for activities, particularly because most activities are co-organized.  Finally, a limitation on the findings of this assessment is that the MS that participate in ECSM are  commonly variant among the years, making the results less comparable however this will be remedied in  future years.  ECSM Campaign Survey Questionnaire  The questionnaire is an important tool used to gather the opinions of the MS coordinators that are  engaged in the campaign. The charts below present the replies of 15 participants representing their MS.  An increase of 3 participants compared to the previous year.  5.2.1 Member States replies  1. How would you rate the overall implementation of the ECSM 2018 campaign (scale 1-5)?  2. Did ECSM support in a satisfactory manner the outreach and promotion of your work?  ECSM 2018 Deployment Report  January 2019  46  3. Did ECSM add value to your national campaign?  4. Did ECSM offer opportunities for improving your national campaigns through collaboration with other  Countries?  5. Do you think ENISA succeeded in the sharing and promotion of new ideas among ECSM partners?  ECSM 2018 Deployment Report  January 2019  47  6. Did the kick video clip produced for ECSM support your national campaign?  7. Could ECSM better promote the awareness material produced by its partners’ campaigns?  8. Would you want ENISA to facilitate in the engagement of the private sector in future campaigns?  ECSM 2018 Deployment Report  January 2019  48  9. Would you want to further align ECSM with international awareness raising campaigns?  10. Do you think that ECSM offers opportunities for fostering a pan-European cyber security culture?  ECSM 2018 Deployment Report  January 2019  49  5.2.2 Consolidated results  MS coordinators valued the implementation of campaign to be good and above based on the results of Q1.  This result is slightly better than last year’s results as all answers are marked as positive.  Again this year, the overwhelming majority of MS coordinators agreed that the campaign added value to  their work, and that it supports their local national campaigns throughout the promotion of their work (Q2  and Q3). Two partners have encouraged the ECSM campaign to use available communications channels  more efficiently (e.g., twitter, Facebook) and to better promote partners’ produced awareness materials.  The majority of MS coordinators (66,6%) are convinced that the campaign offered opportunities for  collaboration and sharing of ideas among the MS and only the 13, 3% believes that this is not the case  (Q4). On the other hand 53, 3% believe that ECSM offers opportunities for improving the national  campaigns through collaboration with other countries, while a 26,6% believes it does not (Q5).  Feedback on the added value of this year’s ECSM kick-off video clip was positive from the majority of  partners. 60% believe that the video clip successfully supported the national campaigns, while only a 26,  6% thought otherwise (Q6). 40% of MS coordinators denoted that the ECSM could do better in promoting  the MS awareness material (Q7). The feedback for better promotion of material included the following  suggestions on how this could be achieved:   Use additional channels to promote national campaigns’ awareness material, such as Facebook, in  addition to existing ones as it is the ECSM website and twitter   Awareness material and core messages should be promoted with more graphical/video content and in  all languages   Awareness messages should be more charming/funny and thus more attractive to the target audience   Use the ECSM communication Tools (social network, website etc.) to support the national campaigns  on the basis of the 2018 infographics per countries   Use the coordination skills of ENISA to facilitate common projects involving ENISA and numerous  Member States   Place a greater effort and interaction in twitter to supporting the Member States’ campaigns (“liking”  and more “sharing”)  Feedback related to the private sector’s engagement in future campaigns was positive amongst 66% of the  participants however 34% rejected or hesitated to respond (Q8). A suggestion from a MS coordinator was  that this should be discussed in a future ECSM meeting amongst the MS:  “It is good to have the private actors involved, as they can reach a greater audience, however the engagement of private  actors should remain a decision taken at the national level. Each member state has a différent organization and rules  to integrate the private sector in its campaign.”  Finally, the majority of MS coodinators were positive about the prospect of aligning ECSM with  international campaigns at 86,6% (Q9) and all MS coordinators fully supported the ECSM campaign for  offering more and more opportunities for fostering EU-wide cyber security culture (Q10).  Web analytics  Web analytics provided the statistical data for ECSM web site and social media channels. The purpose of  gathering these figures were to evaluate the impact and visibility of the campaign.  ECSM 2018 Deployment Report  January 2019  50  5.3.1 ECSM Web Page  The analysis takes into consideration multiple variables in relation to different types of access points to the  ECSM website for the period of October and include:   Page views: 99,057   Website visits: 27,100   Downloads: 1,538  Figure 10: Graph overview of ECSM web site visits in October 2018.  Below is a comparison between this year’s campaign and previous years with respect to the number of  page views to the ECSM webpage. Statistics demonstrate that the ECSM website achieved stable growth in  2018, post the above average growth for 2017.  Figure 11: Overview of annual increase of ECSM page views  5.3.2 NIS Quiz  The total number of NIS Quiz page views for this year’s campaign reached 62,997 views out of a total of  approximately 142,294 views to the web site, which took place in the period from 1st September to 15th of  November. Within 1st to 31st of October 2018, the total number of page views reached 15,191, a small  decrease from the previous year. These statistics demonstrate the popularity that the NIS quiz has gained  during the campaign, equating to approximately 17,6% of the total ECSM website traffic.  48000 52000 57890  92507  99057  2014 2015 2016 2017 2018  ECSM 2018 Deployment Report  January 2019  51  Figure 12: NIS quiz page views within ECSM October’s events.  The 62,997 views of the NIS Quiz from 1st September to 15th of November can be further broken down  between the views to the main page and the introductory video of the quiz as follows:   28,507 page views were dedicated to accessing the main NIS Quiz page   6,040 page views were dedicated for accessing the introductory YouTube video of the quiz  The total number of visitors succeeding to complete the NIS Quiz during month October and compared to  previous years decreased from 2392 in 2017, to 1,822 in 2018. This year’s statistics have also shown that  from a total number of 15,191 visits to the main NIS Quiz main page, only 1,822 visitors eventually  managed to complete it, a total of approximately 12%.  5.3.3 ECSM Map of Activities  The images below illustrate the number of events taking placing in October and the number of Member  States / EFTA countries and other European countries organizing activities. The left hand side graph  presents the total number of events registered each year from 2014 to 2018.  On the right hand side, the  number of EU countries for which at least one event is registered for the same period, is also illustrated.  Figure 13: Number of activities in October and the number of countries registering activities annually  The rate of growth in 2018 has shown a stable increase of submitted events since previous year’s  campaign. A stable growth rate of events year on year were recorded from inception up until 2015,  wherein the number of events registered almost doubled in 2016. The growth in the number of events  registered is an outcome of the increased popularity of the campaign, which grows steadily on a yearly  basis.  184 242  455  532 567  2014 2015 2016 2017 2018  30 32 32 37 35  2 0 1 4 2 0 1 5 2 0 1 6 2 0 1 7 2 0 1 8  COUNTRIES  PARTICIPATION  ECSM 2018 Deployment Report  January 2019  52  The top ten MS with respect to the number of events registered during October are displayed in the pie  charts below for 2017 and 2018. A notable difference from last year’s campaign is Poland and Hungary,  that are now included in the top 5 MS with the most number of registered activities.  Figure 14: Top Ten countries with respect to the number of events registered for ECSM 2017 and 2018  5.3.4 Social Media  Twitter continues to support the promotion and outreach of the campaign. The figures below demonstrate  the fluctuation of twitter followers from September until November 2018 for the handle  @CyberSecMonth. The highest peak corresponds to the launch of ECSM and specifically the Kick-off event  on the 1st of October, followed by renewed interest again until the latter end of the month.  Useful statistics that are extracted from the graph are:   The total number of followers reached 16,500   The amount of 1,667 new accounts were created within this three month period  Figure 15: The daily growth of Twitter followers from September to November 2018 to @CyberSecMonth  The graph below tracks the growth in the number of twitter followers of @CyberSecMonth over time. It  shows an accelerated growth also in this year’s 2018 campaign.  ECSM 2018 Deployment Report  January 2019  53  Figure 16: Annual number of Twitter followers @CyberSecMonth  5.3.5 Media Reach  The European Cyber Security Month (ECSM) project was supported by an impactful Digital Public Affairs  cross-channel campaign led by the hashtag #CyberSecMonth. The statistical results of the campaign  demonstrate a stellar online impact endorsed by a remarkable amount of mentions, reach and social  media interactions.  A total number of 1655 articles that mention ECSM from the period 24th of September till the 9th of  November have been recorded with a total estimated reach of audience exposed of 9051133. The  majority of #CyberSecMonth mentions were created on Twitter (829) and Instagram (351), followed by  Facebook (313) and traditional blogs (20).  The following statistics provide in-depth insights into the impact of the #CyberSecMonth campaign, and  the general exposure of the Digital Public Affairs campaign supporting the European Cyber Security Month.  Table 3: High level statistics of ECSM 2018 for the #CYBERSECMONTH campaign  ECSM 2018 Deployment Report  January 2019  54  The following table indicates the amount of mentions and reach of the top 15 countries in context of the  #CyberSecMonth campaign. These statistics are estimations based on geolocation of IP addresses.  Table 4: Amount of #CYBERSECMONTH campaign mentions per country in world-wide scale  Figure 17: A comparison overview of the campaign’s number of articles published and online reach in years 2014-2018.  5.3.6 Get Cyber Skilled Campaign data  ‘Get Cyber Skilled’ eTwinning learning event came to a close on 22 October.   164 teachers coming from 22 countries took part in the online event consisting of five different  modules. ¾ of the participants received the final course certificate.   While the post-event evaluation survey is still open, preliminary results show that 58 per cent of  respondents regard the Learning Event as “excellent” while 41 per cent considered it to be “very  100 146 429 330  1655  2014 2015 2016 2017 2018  4000000  6000000  11200000  8650000 9051133  2014 2015 2016 2017 2018  ECSM 2018 Deployment Report  January 2019  55  good”, and 70 per cent declared they will be using the acquired skills and information in their teaching  activities.   On social media, the #GetCyberSkilled hashtag received extremely good coverage as demonstrated by  the Union Metrics tracker stats which show that it obtained a potential 1.8 million impressions since  September 2018. (Source Twitter Analytics).   The most successful media tweet this month was related to the #GetCyberSkilled Learning event which  earned over 100 engagements. (Source Twitter Analytics).  5.3.7 Conclusions  The majority of the indicators used to evaluate the campaign demonstrate a higher growth rate year on  year. For this year, a linear growth has been noticeable with respect to the rate of Twitter followers, the  ECSM web page views, ECSM map of activities, the campaigns online reach, while a rather substantial  increase on the articles that mention ECSM was recorded. Some analytics did demonstrate a small  decrease in comparison to previous year such as the NIS quiz page views and completion attempts.  Conclusively, the increase of the ECSM campaign’s popularity is visible in all numbers, contributing towards  an indisputable higher performance in comparison to all previous years, leading to a successful campaign  also for ECSM 2018.  ECSM 2018 Deployment Report  January 2019  56  6. Conclusions  The evaluation of the campaign is based on the analytical data gathered, the feedback received from MS  coordinators and for the first time the use of evaluation metrics data from the base year of 2017. The  campaign continues to grow in line with expectations and the long term growth rate. Several of the factors  that contributed to the success of the campaign in 2018 were:   the increased commitment by the Member States towards awareness raising,   the “Get Cyber Skilled” campaign supported by the European Commission, European Schoolnet and  SaferInternet4EU campaign,   the awareness campaign executed by EC3 & EBF related to “Cyberscams”   and outreach using social media channels.  In the ECSM deployment report of 2017 a number of observations were made by ENISA to support the  success of the campaign going forward. These observations are revisited below and include updates on  how they were addressed during the year.  6.1.1 Evaluation metrics  This was the second year that evaluation metrics were collected from the MS and resulted in the first year  a comparison could be drawn from previous year’s results to evaluate the campaigns progress.  The  number of Member States contributing to the evaluation metrics increased from seven in 2017 to ten in  2018, however only three countries reported in both years.  Although the results are averaged per MS,  comparable results will only be achieved once all MS are providing comprehensive metrics year on year.  6.1.2 Member State Commitment  The core campaign coordinators participating actively in the monthly conference calls and physical  meeting increased with the addition of Belgium and Malta.  Member States & EFTA countries actively participating in the campaign include: Austria, Belgium Czech  Republic, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Hungary, Luxembourg, Malta, Netherlands, Norway, Portugal  Poland, Romania, Slovenia, and Switzerland.  6.1.3 Private Sector Involvement  The private sector continued to show much willingness to contribute to the campaign.  The structure and  form of such an engagement remains to be decided by the MS.  6.1.4 Governance Structure  The proposal for the introduction of a governance structure was a moot point for some of the MS during  the physical meeting in Brussels.  Concerns raised included obligations, responsibilities, keeping deadlines  and loss of flexibility if a governance structure was in place, whilst for others considered a governance  structure as overkill given that there is not budgetary decisions to make.  6.1.5 Collaboration with the European Commission  There was a step up in collaboration with the European Commission during the run up to October.  A  number of significant steps were taken to cross promote each other’s efforts.  The first being the  saferinternet4EU campaign for which ENISA supported with the Get Cyber Skilled campaign during week  two and the second being the award of European Schoolnet competition for which the ENISA Executive  Director was Ambassador.  ECSM 2018 Deployment Report  January 2019  57  6.1.6 Annual ECSM Launch Event  It was decided during the physical meeting in Brussels with the MS that the annual kick-off event to launch  the campaign will be replaced by a kick-off video featuring the MS with messages and a call to action.  The  video included messages from seven MS in their local languages and also a message and call to action from  the Commissioner Mariya Gabriel.  As of the December 2018 the kick-off video has had over 1500 views in the space of two months that will  continue to grow over time. If we are to compare the amount of viewers of the video with the amount of  participants present at the 2017 annual ECSM kick-off event in Tallinn, the outreach of the video is tenfold.  Thus the decision to use video as a medium to reach out to European citizens has been vindicated by the  numbers; however much work is needed to reach the millions of citizens of Europe.

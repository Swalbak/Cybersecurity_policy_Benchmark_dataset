This guidance  addresses targeted cyber intrusions (i.e. those executed by advanced persistent threats such as foreign intelligence  services), ransomware and external adversaries with destructive intent, malicious insiders, ‘business email  compromise’, and industrial control systems.  This guidance is informed by the ACSC’s experience in responding to cyber security incidents, performing vulnerability  assessments and penetration testing Australian government organisations.  Prior to implementing any of the mitigation strategies, organisations need to identify their assets and perform a risk  assessment to identify the level of protection required from various cyber threats. Furthermore, organisations require  motivation to improve their cyber security posture, supportive executives, access to skilled cyber security professionals  and adequate financial resources. Motivators can include a significant cyber security incident, a penetration test,  mandatory data breach reporting, mandatory compliance, and evidence of a lower cyber security posture or higher  threat exposure than previously realised.  The following page provides mitigation strategies and a suggested implementation order for:   targeted cyber intrusions and other external adversaries who steal data   ransomware denying access to data for monetary gain, and external adversaries who destroy data and prevent  computers/networks from functioning   malicious insiders who steal data such as customer details or intellectual property   malicious insiders who destroy data and prevent computers/networks from functioning.  When implementing a mitigation strategy, first implement it for high risk users and computers such as those with  access to important (sensitive or high-availability) data and exposed to untrustworthy internet content, and then  implement it for all other users and computers. Organisations should perform hands-on testing to verify the  effectiveness of their implementation of mitigation strategies.  No set of mitigation strategies is guaranteed to prevent all cyber security incidents. However, properly implementing  the eight mitigation strategies with an ‘essential’ effectiveness rating is so effective at mitigating targeted cyber  intrusions and ransomware, that the ACSC considers these to be the new cyber security baseline for all organisations.  The companion Strategies to Mitigate Cyber Security Incidents – Mitigation Details publication contains  implementation guidance for the mitigation strategies, as well as guidance to mitigate ‘business email compromise’ and  threats to Industrial Control Systems. Further, the companion Essential Eight Maturity Model publication advises how  to implement mitigation strategies in a phased approach and how to measure the maturity of their implementation.  Finally, the ACSC’s website has supporting guidance in the Information Security Manual, as well as separate guidance  for mitigating denial of service, and securely using cloud computing and enterprise mobility.  Strategies to Mitigate  Cyber Security Incidents  First published: February 2010  Last updated:  February 2017  https://www.cyber.gov.au/resources-business-and-government/essential-cyber-security/strategies-mitigate-cyber-security-incidents https://www.cyber.gov.au/resources-business-and-government/essential-cyber-security/essential-eight https://www.cyber.gov.au/resources-business-and-government/essential-cyber-security/ism  2  Strategies to Mitigate Cyber Security Incidents  Last Updated: February 2017. First published February 2010.  Suggested Mitigation Strategy Implementation Order  (start with threats of most concern to the organisation)  Targeted cyber intrusions (advanced persistent threats)  and other external adversaries who steal data:  1. Implement ‘essential’ mitigation strategies to:  a. prevent malware delivery and execution  b. limit the extent of cyber security incidents  c. detect cyber security incidents and respond.  2. Repeat step 1 with ‘excellent’ mitigation strategies.  3. Repeat step 1 with less effective mitigation strategies  until an acceptable level of residual risk is reached.  Ransomware and external adversaries who destroy data  and prevent computers/networks from functioning:  1. Implement ‘essential’ mitigation strategies to:  a. recover data and system availability  b. prevent malware delivery and execution  c. limit the extent of cyber security incidents  d. detect cyber security incidents and respond.  2. Repeat step 1 with ‘excellent’ mitigation strategies.  3. Repeat step 1 with less effective mitigation strategies  until an acceptable level of residual risk is reached.  Note that ‘Hunt to discover incidents’ is less relevant for  ransomware that immediately makes itself visible.  Malicious insiders who steal data:  1. Implement ‘Control removable storage media and  connected devices’ to mitigate data exfiltration.  2. Implement ‘Outbound web and email data loss  prevention’.  3. Implement ‘essential’ mitigation strategies to:  a. limit the extent of cyber security incidents  b. detect cyber security incidents and respond.  4. Repeat step 3 with ‘excellent’ mitigation strategies.  5. Implement ‘Personnel management’.  6. If employees are likely to have hacking skills and  tools, implement ‘essential’ mitigation strategies to  prevent malware delivery and execution, and repeat  step 3 with less effective mitigation strategies until  an acceptable level of residual risk is reached.  Note that technical mitigation strategies provide  incomplete security since data could be photographed or  otherwise copied from computer screens or printouts, or  memorised and written down outside of the workplace.  Malicious insiders who destroy data and prevent  computers/networks from functioning:  1. Implement ‘essential’ mitigation strategies to:  a. recover data and system availability  b. limit the extent of cyber security incidents  c. detect cyber security incidents and respond.  2. Repeat step 1 with ‘excellent’ mitigation strategies.  3. Implement ‘Personnel management’.  4. If employees are likely to have hacking skills and  tools, implement ‘essential’ mitigation strategies to  prevent malware delivery and execution, and repeat  step 1 with less effective mitigation strategies until  an acceptable level of residual risk is reached.

High High High  3  Summary of key changes since previous version  The title and scope of the publication have been updated to mitigate additional threats. Three new mitigation strategies  to recover data and system availability help mitigate ransomware. The new mitigation strategies ‘Personnel  management’ and ‘Outbound web and email data loss prevention’ help mitigate malicious insiders. The Mitigation  Details publication has new guidance for these threats as well as for business email compromise and industrial control  systems.  The leftmost numerical ranking column was being misinterpreted by some readers, and has been converted into a  suggested mitigation strategy implementation order for each threat, providing a principles-based approach to building  a defence-in-depth cyber security posture.  The rightmost four columns (e.g. ‘Helps Prevent Intrusion Stage 1: Code Execution’) have been converted into category  headings (e.g. ‘Mitigation Strategies to Prevent Malware Delivery and Execution’). Mitigation strategies have been  categorised based on their primary security outcome.  Effectiveness ratings now include ‘very good’, while ‘average’ has been changed to ‘limited’.  Mitigation strategy ‘Application control’ now mentions Windows Script Host, PowerShell and HTML Applications (HTA).  Further guidance has been added to the Mitigation Details publication.  The two patching mitigation strategies now reference the ACSC’s definition of ‘extreme risk’ security vulnerabilities to  reflect that the 48 hour (previously two day) timeframe to apply patches doesn’t apply to every security vulnerability  affecting every computer. The list of applications has been reordered since Flash, web browsers and Microsoft Office  are exploited more than Java and PDF viewers.  New mitigation strategy ‘Configure Microsoft Office macro settings’ has been extracted from mitigation strategy ‘User  application hardening’ to reflect the prevalence of malicious Microsoft Office macros. The ACSC has seen our guidance  mitigate attempts to compromise Australian organisations by adversaries working for a foreign intelligence service.  Mitigation strategy ‘User application hardening’ is now rated ‘essential’ and advises to uninstall Adobe Flash if possible,  disable Microsoft Office OLE packages, and block internet ads due to malicious advertising (malvertising). Some  organisations might choose to support selected websites that rely on ads for revenue by enabling just their ads and  potentially risking compromise.  Mitigation strategy ‘Multi-factor authentication’ is now rated ‘essential’ to reflect the prevalence of passphrase theft  and the abuse of remote access for infiltration, data exfiltration and persistence.  Mitigation strategy ‘Enforce a strong passphrase policy’ has been renamed to ‘Protect authentication credentials’,  contains specific new guidance and is now rated ‘excellent’.  The two logging mitigation strategies have been combined into mitigation strategy ‘Continuous incident detection and  response’. Also, while the key goal remains to identify and protect assets to prevent cyber security incidents, two new  mitigation strategies reduce the time to detect and respond to such incidents – ‘Endpoint detection and response  software’ and ‘Hunt to discover incidents’ leveraging threat intelligence. Details are in the Mitigation Details  publication.  Mitigation strategy ‘Server application hardening’ is now rated ‘very good’ to reflect an increase in cyber security  incidents involving web servers compromised with web shells.  Mitigation strategy ‘Block spoofed emails’ now advises to configure DMARC DNS records.  Mitigation strategies ‘Web domain whitelisting for all domains’, ‘Block attempts to access websites by their IP address’  and ‘Gateway blacklisting’ have merged into ‘Web content filtering’.  Mitigation strategies ‘Restrict access to Server Message Block (SMB) and NetBIOS’ and ‘Workstation inspection of  Microsoft Office files’ have merged with existing mitigation strategies.

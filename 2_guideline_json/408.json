Article 3 of the regulation states  that providers can implement reasonable traffic management measures, which must be transparent, non- discriminatory, proportionate, and based on objective technical quality of service requirements. Beyond  these reasonable traffic management measures, providers can not implement traffic management measures  that block, slow down, alter, restrict, interfere with, degrade or discriminate between specific content,  applications or services, except when it is necessary  a) to comply with EU or national legislation or court orders,  b) to preserve the integrity or security of the networks, the services using the networks, or the end-  user equipment, or  c) to prevent an impending network congestion, which is temporary and exceptional.  Article 5 of the Open Internet Regulation requires National Telecom Regulatory Authorities (NRAs) to  supervise and enforce net neutrality, requiring them to, among other things, closely monitor and ensure  compliance with Article 3. In doing so, NRAs may assess whether a traffic management measure applied by  a provider, in a specific case, is permissible under Article 3. In its recent Opinion2 BEREC indicates it will work  on further clarifications on how NRAs may assess security measures under Article 3.  This document is a technical guideline for NRAs to support them in assessing when security measures are  justified under point (b) above. This guideline contains:   A list of evaluation factors that may be taken into account by NRAs to understand whether a security  measure is justified or not (see Section 3.1).   An evaluation checklist that NRAs may use when assessing if a measure is justified (see Section 3.2).   A justification form that may be used by NRAs to collect information about a security measure from  providers (see Section 3.3). The justification form may be used also by providers as part of their  internal processes to document which security measures they consider to fall under this exception.  It is important to note that whether or not a security measure is justified under exception b (see above)  depends on the circumstances, the type of networks, services, etc. Security is a fast moving field and cyber- attacks are changing constantly. What may have been an effective measure at one point in time, in the  middle of a large-scale attack for instance, may be considered as unnecessary and disproportionate later on.  In the annex of this paper we give two hypothetical examples showing how the justification form and the  evaluation checklist could be filled in.  1 Regulation (EU) 2015/2120 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 November 2015 laying down  measures concerning open internet access and amending Directive 2002/22/EC and Regulation (EU) No 531/2012  https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:32015R2120&from=EN  2 BEREC Opinion for the evaluation of the application of Regulation (EU) 2015/2120 and the BEREC Net Neutrality  Guidelines”  Guideline on assessing security measures in the context of Article  3(3) of the Open Internet regulation  Version 1.0 - December 2018  05  1. Introduction  The EU’s Open Internet Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2015/2120), which came into force in 2016, establishes  rules for providers of internet access services in the EU to ensure equal and non- discriminatory treatment  of internet traffic. The Regulation allows providers to make two types of traffic management:   Traffic management measures that are reasonable, where reasonable means that they have to be  proportionate, transparent, non-discriminatory, not be based on commercial considerations, based  on objective technical quality of service requirements.   Exceptional traffic management measures going beyond reasonable traffic management measures  (which block, slow down, alter, restrict, interfere with, degrade or discriminate between specific  content, applications or services, or specific categories thereof) that are necessary,  a. to comply with EU or national legislation or court orders,  b. to preserve the integrity or security of  i. networks  ii. services using the networks  iii. end-user equipment  c. to prevent an impending network congestion, which is temporary and exceptional.  This document is a technical guideline for NRAs to provide guidance on point b above.  1.1 Scope  The scope of this guideline is the security exception (point b above) to the net neutrality rule. The goal is to  help NRAs in evaluating whether or not a particular security measure is necessary to preserve the integrity  or security of networks, services using the networks. This guideline does not prescribe or exhaustively list  justifiable security measures, or cyber threats that must be mitigated by providers, because what is  justifiable under the exception depends on the circumstances.  1.2 Target audience  This guideline is intended for NRAs in the EU and EFTA countries. This guideline may also be useful for  providers of internet access services operating in the EU and EFTA countries.  1.3 Terminology  The term “security measure” is broad and in general security measures can range from the installation of an  antivirus software on a computer, to background checks on personnel, incident response procedures,  backup power diesel generators, failover submarine cables, etc. In this guideline the term \"security  measures\" refers to the security measures relevant under this exception (i.e. item b of Article 3.3 of the  Open Internet  Regulation).  In practice, the security measures most commonly implemented by providers under this exception, include  measures like port blocking, permanently or temporarily, for certain traffic, for instance outbound traffic, or  for certain customers, DNS blackholing, to address malware of DDoS attacks by using DNS redirection, or  blocking of IP addresses. In most cases these security measures are directly related to ongoing or recent  DDoS attacks or malware campaigns or critical vulnerabilities in common software or protocols.  Guideline on assessing security measures in the context of Article  3(3) of the Open Internet regulation  Version 1.0 - December 2018  06  2. Legal context  The EU’s Open Internet Regulation establishes the rules for equal and non- discriminatory treatment of  internet traffic provision across Europe. The Regulation enshrines the principle of Net Neutrality into EU law  and protects rights of end-users of electronic communication networks and services by providing a legal  framework for an open internet. Providers of internet access services are not allowed to block, throttle or  discriminate certain end-users or certain traffic, services or applications, except in certain cases. These are  when the exceptions of Article 3(3) of the Regulation are met.  We quote Article 3(3) verbatim for the sake of reference:  Article 3 Safeguarding of open internet access  3. Providers of internet access services shall treat all traffic equally, when providing internet access services,  without discrimination, restriction or interference, and irrespective of the sender and receiver, the content  accessed or distributed, the applications or services used or provided, or the terminal equipment used.  The first subparagraph shall not prevent providers of internet access services from implementing  reasonable traffic management measures. In order to be deemed to be reasonable, such measures shall be  transparent, non-discriminatory and proportionate, and shall not be based on commercial considerations  but on objectively different technical quality of service requirements of specific categories of traffic. Such  measures shall not monitor the specific content and shall not be maintained for longer than necessary.  Providers of internet access services shall not engage in traffic management measures going beyond those  set out in the second subparagraph, and in particular shall not block, slow down, alter, restrict, interfere  with, degrade or discriminate between specific content, applications or services, or specific categories  thereof, except as necessary, and only for as long as necessary, in order to:  (a) comply with Union legislative acts, or national legislation that complies with Union law, to which  the provider of internet access services is subject, or with measures that comply with Union law giving  effect to such Union legislative acts or national legislation, including with orders by courts or public  authorities vested with relevant powers;  (b) preserve the integrity and security of the network, of services provided via that network, and of the  terminal equipment of end-users;  (c) prevent impending network congestion and mitigate the effects of exceptional or temporary  network congestion, provided that equivalent categories of traffic are treated equally.  Examples of traffic management measures going beyond the reasonable ones and which might be  permissible under the exception b) are mentioned in the preamble 14 of the Open Internet Regulation:  “ (14) Second, traffic management measures going beyond such reasonable traffic management measures  might be necessary to protect the integrity and security of the network, for example by preventing cyber- attacks that occur through the spread of malicious software or identity theft of end-users that occurs as a  result of spyware.”.  Guideline on assessing security measures in the context of Article  3(3) of the Open Internet regulation  Version 1.0 - December 2018  07  BEREC in its “Guidelines on the Implementation by National Regulators of European Net Neutrality Rules”3  provides recommendations to the NRAs on the implementation of their obligations. We quote BEREC’s  guideline in relation to the security exception (article 3(3) b), for the sake of completeness:  “Article 3(3) (b)  83.  Typical attacks and threats that will trigger integrity and security measures include:  • flooding network components or terminal equipment with traffic to destabilise them (e.g. Denial of  Service attack);  • spoofing IP addresses in order to mimic network devices or allow for unauthorised communication;  • hacking attacks against network components or terminal equipment;  • distribution of malicious software, viruses etc.  84. Conducting traffic management measures in order to preserve integrity and security of the network  could basically consist of restricting connectivity or blocking of traffic to and from specific endpoints.  Typical examples of such traffic management measures include:  • blocking of IP addresses, or ranges of them, because they are well-known sources of attacks;  • blocking of IP addresses from which an actual attack is originating;  • blocking of IP addresses/IAS showing suspicious behaviour (e.g. unauthorised communication with  network components, address spoofing);  blocking of IP addresses where there are clear indications that they are part of a bot network;  • blocking of specific port numbers which constitute a threat to security and integrity.  85. NRAs should consider that, in order to identify attacks and activate security measures, the use of  security monitoring systems by ISPs is often justified. In such cases, the monitoring of traffic to detect  security threats (such as those listed in paragraph 84) may be implemented in the background on a  continuous basis, while the actual traffic management measure preserving integrity and security is  triggered only when concrete security threats are detected. Therefore, the precondition “only for as long as  necessary” does not preclude implementation of such monitoring of the integrity and security of the  network.  86. Besides monitoring the integrity and security of the network, possible security threats may also be  identified on the basis of reports/complaints from end-users or blocking lists from recognised security  organisations.  87. This exception could be used as a basis for circumvention of the Regulation because security is a broad  concept. NRAs should therefore carefully assess whether the requirements of this exception are met and to  request that ISPs provide adequate justifications when necessary.”  3 BEREC Guidelines on the Implementation by National Regulators of European Net Neutrality Rules  https://berec.europa.eu/eng/document_register/subject_matter/berec/regulatory_best_practices/guidelines/6160- berec-guidelines-on-the-implementation-by-national-regulators-of-european-net-neutrality-rules  Guideline on assessing security measures in the context of Article  3(3) of the Open Internet regulation  Version 1.0 - December 2018  08  3. Evaluating the necessity of security measures  This section provides guidance for NRAs in evaluating the necessity of security measures and contains   A list of evaluation factors that could be taken into account by NRAs,   A checklist for evaluating the factors and weighing the pros and cons of a measure,   A justification form, which could be used by NRAs to collect information from providers  3.1 Evaluation factors  Providers of internet access services need to have appropriate security measures in place. To keep their  networks and services secure they continuously make risk assessments about security threats, risks and  measures. Following a risk assessment, a provider may decide that a certain security measure is necessary  to protect the networks, the services using the network, or end-user equipment. This risk assessment takes  into account many factors, including the severity of the threat, the cost and complexity of a measure, side- effects etc.  NRAs may need to assess whether or not a certain security measure is justified, for example following a  complaint by an end-user. In general, this assessment requires a case-by-case evaluation, because it depends  on circumstances, which are specific for that provider. It is impossible to make an exhaustive or prescriptive  list of security measures that are justified.  NRAs could take into account the following factors when evaluating if a security measure is necessary:  1) Security risk – the security risk for the network, services, and/or end-user equipment  2) Effectiveness - the effectiveness of the security measure in reducing the risk  3) Proportionality  - the proportionality of the measure, i.e. limited in time and scope, few side-effects  4) Appropriateness – the appropriateness of the measure, i.e. in line with industry good practices  The evaluation factors are explained in more detail below.  3.1.1 Security risk  A security risk, associated with a threat, is high if the potential impact of the threat is high and the likelihood  that the threat materializes is high. In this context, what matters is the risk for the network, services, and/or  the end-user equipment. If the security risk is not high, then the security measure may not be justifiable.  Questions to ask:   How severe and urgent is the security threat?   What is the potential impact of the security threat?   What is the likelihood that the security threat materializes and has an impact?  To assess security risk one must look at both the likelihood and the impact. Threats with a low potential  impact and a low probability, for instance, are minor risks. Threats with high probability and high impact are  major risks. Annex B includes a standard table to rate risks based on likelihood and impact.  3.1.2 Effectiveness  A security measure is effective if it reduces the security risk (see above) significantly. If the measure does  not reduce the risk by much, then the security measure may not be justifiable. Questions to ask:   To what extent is the risk mitigated when the security measure is implemented?   What would the impact be on the network, services and customers if the measure is not applied?  Guideline on assessing security measures in the context of Article  3(3) of the Open Internet regulation  Version 1.0 - December 2018  09   What is the residual risk?  3.1.3 Proportionality  A security measure is proportional when it mitigates the threat effectively, without too many side-effects.  In the context of the net neutrality rules it is important to assess the impact of the measure on competing  services, on ‘good’ network traffic, ‘normal’ use of end-user equipment, etc. If the security measure blocks  a lot of ‘good’ network traffic or if the blocking disables an entire network protocol or software  application, then the security measure may not be justifiable. Questions to ask:   Is the scope of the measure limited to specific traffic, networks, or end-user?   What is the duration, is the measure time-limited?   Is there impact on ‘good’ network traffic and legitimate services (false positives)?   Is there impact for the end-users?  3.1.4 Appropriateness  A security measure is appropriate when it is the right measure for this risk, considering the threat landscape,  the technology, industry standards and good practices, alternatives solutions, etc. Questions to ask:   Is the measure considered the appropriate measure to mitigate this threat/risk?   Is the measure recommended in industry good practices or standards?   Are there alternatives that are more effective or more proportionate?  As mentioned already, whether or not a security measure is justifiable as being necessary depends on the  circumstances. Providers will need to do a risk assessment and evaluate this on a case-by–case basis. Also, the NRAs  may need to evaluate if a security measure is justifiable, by looking at all the factors, weighing the pros and the cons.  The table below gives some examples of how these factors could weigh in an evaluation.  FACTORS MORE JUSTIFIED (+) LESS JUSTIFIED (-)  Security risk The risk is major The risk is minor  Effectiveness Residual risk is significantly reduced.  Residual risk hardly changed. Risks before and  after are similar.  Proportionality Targeted scope and duration, few side-effects.  Blunt and wide-ranging, many side-effects, lots  of good traffic and services are blocked.  Appropriateness  It is a common approach, an industry good  practice. No alternatives.  It is an unusual measure for mitigating this  threat. Usually done differently.  3.2 Evaluation checklist  An NRA may receive a complaint or be otherwise triggered to investigate if a security measure is justifiable  under the net neutrality rules. NRAs can use the evaluation factors in an evaluation procedure, for example  as part of an evaluation checklist. We give an example checklist below.  EVALUATION CHECKLIST  Security measure summary  Provider(s) involved, network/services in scope, summary of security measure  Guideline on assessing security measures in the context of Article  3(3) of the Open Internet regulation  Version 1.0 - December 2018  10  EVALUATION CHECKLIST  Evaluation factors  Security risk ++, +, -, or -- Details  Effectiveness ++, +, -, or -- Details  Proportionality ++, +, -, or -- Details  Appropriateness ++, +, -, or -- Details  Overall conclusion  The security measure can/cannot be justified under the security exception in the net  neutrality rules, because…  Recommendation for provider(s)  3.3 Justification form  As part of an evaluation, NRAs may need to collect information from providers about security measures in  place. This section proposes a justification form for collecting and structuring the relevant information about  a security measure. Providers could also use this justification form as part of internal processes, to document  the reasoning and justification behind security measures.

Guideline on assessing security measures in the context of Article  3(3) of the Open Internet regulation  Version 1.0 - December 2018  12  Annex A: Examples  In this annex we give two examples by filling in the justification form for some hypothethical cases.   Blocking of ports TCP/7547 and TCP/5555  to counter Mirai malware by the provider FastBits   Blocking of ports UDP/161 to protect from a Microsoft PC vulnerability by the provider HomeNet.  For each of these cases, we also show how the factors could weigh in the evaluation by listing, hypothetically,  the pros and cons of the implemented security  measures.

Communication  Measure explained and listed at:  www.homenet.com/security  Opt-out Yes, opt-out available – upon request.  Below we show an example of how to use the evaluation factors in an assessment.  FACTORS PROS CONS  Security risk  There is a major risk for the terminal equipment  of end-users, of infection of their PCs.  There is a major risk for the ISP services, because  these infections are used to create DDoS attacks  causing outages.  Effectiveness  Very effective. Measure prevents spreading of  infection and reduces DDoS attacks (using SNMP  reflection).  Proportionality  Limited side effects, because SNMP is used for  network management which is usually not done  over a WAN connection.  Guideline on assessing security measures in the context of Article  3(3) of the Open Internet regulation  Version 1.0 - December 2018  16  FACTORS PROS CONS  Duration of the measure is time-limited (1 year)  Appropriateness  Measure is mentioned as an industry good  practice  Ideally, remotely exploitable vulnerabilities in  devices should be addressed by the device  manufacturers and operating system vendors,  not the telecom operator.  Guideline on assessing security measures in the context of Article  3(3) of the Open Internet regulation  Version 1.0 - December 2018  17  Annex B: Risk assessment  Risk is usually rated by taking the product of likelihood (probability) and impact. The table below is based  on the ISO27005 standard for risk management. In this table, both probability and impact are rated from  1- very low, 2-low, 3-medium, 4-high, to 5-very high.  The resulting scale for risk is minor (green), significant (yellow), major (red) and the risk of threats with a  very high impact and a low or very low probability are rated separately, with black. These threats need to  be handled with care, because although the chances that these threats materialize are low, the impact  may be very high (so-called black swans).

Article 3 of the regulation states  that providers can implement reasonable traffic management measures, which must be transparent, non- discriminatory, proportionate, and based on objective technical quality of service requirements. Beyond  these reasonable traffic management measures, providers can not implement traffic management measures  that block, slow down, alter, restrict, interfere with, degrade or discriminate between specific content,  applications or services, except when it is necessary  a) to comply with EU or national legislation or court orders,  b) to preserve the integrity or security of the networks, the services using the networks, or the end-  user equipment, or  c) to prevent an impending network congestion, which is temporary and exceptional.  Article 5 of the Open Internet Regulation requires National Telecom Regulatory Authorities (NRAs) to  supervise and enforce net neutrality, requiring them to, among other things, closely monitor and ensure  compliance with Article 3. In doing so, NRAs may assess whether a traffic management measure applied by  a provider, in a specific case, is permissible under Article 3. In its recent Opinion2 BEREC indicates it will work  on further clarifications on how NRAs may assess security measures under Article 3.  This document is a technical guideline for NRAs to support them in assessing when security measures are  justified under point (b) above. This guideline contains:   A list of evaluation factors that may be taken into account by NRAs to understand whether a security  measure is justified or not (see Section 3.1).   An evaluation checklist that NRAs may use when assessing if a measure is justified (see Section 3.2).   A justification form that may be used by NRAs to collect information about a security measure from  providers (see Section 3.3). The justification form may be used also by providers as part of their  internal processes to document which security measures they consider to fall under this exception.  It is important to note that whether or not a security measure is justified under exception b (see above)  depends on the circumstances, the type of networks, services, etc. Security is a fast moving field and cyber- attacks are changing constantly. What may have been an effective measure at one point in time, in the  middle of a large-scale attack for instance, may be considered as unnecessary and disproportionate later on.  In the annex of this paper we give two hypothetical examples showing how the justification form and the  evaluation checklist could be filled in.  1 Regulation (EU) 2015/2120 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 November 2015 laying down  measures concerning open internet access and amending Directive 2002/22/EC and Regulation (EU) No 531/2012  https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:32015R2120&from=EN  2 BEREC Opinion for the evaluation of the application of Regulation (EU) 2015/2120 and the BEREC Net Neutrality  Guidelines”  Guideline on assessing security measures in the context of Article  3(3) of the Open Internet regulation  Version 1.0 - December 2018  05  1. Introduction  The EU’s Open Internet Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2015/2120), which came into force in 2016, establishes  rules for providers of internet access services in the EU to ensure equal and non- discriminatory treatment  of internet traffic. The Regulation allows providers to make two types of traffic management:   Traffic management measures that are reasonable, where reasonable means that they have to be  proportionate, transparent, non-discriminatory, not be based on commercial considerations, based  on objective technical quality of service requirements.   Exceptional traffic management measures going beyond reasonable traffic management measures  (which block, slow down, alter, restrict, interfere with, degrade or discriminate between specific  content, applications or services, or specific categories thereof) that are necessary,  a. to comply with EU or national legislation or court orders,  b. to preserve the integrity or security of  i. networks  ii. services using the networks  iii. end-user equipment  c. to prevent an impending network congestion, which is temporary and exceptional.  This document is a technical guideline for NRAs to provide guidance on point b above.  1.1 Scope  The scope of this guideline is the security exception (point b above) to the net neutrality rule. The goal is to  help NRAs in evaluating whether or not a particular security measure is necessary to preserve the integrity  or security of networks, services using the networks. This guideline does not prescribe or exhaustively list  justifiable security measures, or cyber threats that must be mitigated by providers, because what is  justifiable under the exception depends on the circumstances.  1.2 Target audience  This guideline is intended for NRAs in the EU and EFTA countries. This guideline may also be useful for  providers of internet access services operating in the EU and EFTA countries.  1.3 Terminology  The term “security measure” is broad and in general security measures can range from the installation of an  antivirus software on a computer, to background checks on personnel, incident response procedures,  backup power diesel generators, failover submarine cables, etc. In this guideline the term \"security  measures\" refers to the security measures relevant under this exception (i.e. item b of Article 3.3 of the  Open Internet  Regulation).  In practice, the security measures most commonly implemented by providers under this exception, include  measures like port blocking, permanently or temporarily, for certain traffic, for instance outbound traffic, or  for certain customers, DNS blackholing, to address malware of DDoS attacks by using DNS redirection, or  blocking of IP addresses. In most cases these security measures are directly related to ongoing or recent  DDoS attacks or malware campaigns or critical vulnerabilities in common software or protocols.  Guideline on assessing security measures in the context of Article  3(3) of the Open Internet regulation  Version 1.0 - December 2018  06  2. Legal context  The EU’s Open Internet Regulation establishes the rules for equal and non- discriminatory treatment of  internet traffic provision across Europe. The Regulation enshrines the principle of Net Neutrality into EU law  and protects rights of end-users of electronic communication networks and services by providing a legal  framework for an open internet. Providers of internet access services are not allowed to block, throttle or  discriminate certain end-users or certain traffic, services or applications, except in certain cases. These are  when the exceptions of Article 3(3) of the Regulation are met.  We quote Article 3(3) verbatim for the sake of reference:  Article 3 Safeguarding of open internet access  3. Providers of internet access services shall treat all traffic equally, when providing internet access services,  without discrimination, restriction or interference, and irrespective of the sender and receiver, the content  accessed or distributed, the applications or services used or provided, or the terminal equipment used.  The first subparagraph shall not prevent providers of internet access services from implementing  reasonable traffic management measures. In order to be deemed to be reasonable, such measures shall be  transparent, non-discriminatory and proportionate, and shall not be based on commercial considerations  but on objectively different technical quality of service requirements of specific categories of traffic. Such  measures shall not monitor the specific content and shall not be maintained for longer than necessary.  Providers of internet access services shall not engage in traffic management measures going beyond those  set out in the second subparagraph, and in particular shall not block, slow down, alter, restrict, interfere  with, degrade or discriminate between specific content, applications or services, or specific categories  thereof, except as necessary, and only for as long as necessary, in order to:  (a) comply with Union legislative acts, or national legislation that complies with Union law, to which  the provider of internet access services is subject, or with measures that comply with Union law giving  effect to such Union legislative acts or national legislation, including with orders by courts or public  authorities vested with relevant powers;  (b) preserve the integrity and security of the network, of services provided via that network, and of the  terminal equipment of end-users;  (c) prevent impending network congestion and mitigate the effects of exceptional or temporary  network congestion, provided that equivalent categories of traffic are treated equally.  Examples of traffic management measures going beyond the reasonable ones and which might be  permissible under the exception b) are mentioned in the preamble 14 of the Open Internet Regulation:  “ (14) Second, traffic management measures going beyond such reasonable traffic management measures  might be necessary to protect the integrity and security of the network, for example by preventing cyber- attacks that occur through the spread of malicious software or identity theft of end-users that occurs as a  result of spyware.”.  Guideline on assessing security measures in the context of Article  3(3) of the Open Internet regulation  Version 1.0 - December 2018  07  BEREC in its “Guidelines on the Implementation by National Regulators of European Net Neutrality Rules”3  provides recommendations to the NRAs on the implementation of their obligations. We quote BEREC’s  guideline in relation to the security exception (article 3(3) b), for the sake of completeness:  “Article 3(3) (b)  83.  Typical attacks and threats that will trigger integrity and security measures include:  • flooding network components or terminal equipment with traffic to destabilise them (e.g. Denial of  Service attack);  • spoofing IP addresses in order to mimic network devices or allow for unauthorised communication;  • hacking attacks against network components or terminal equipment;  • distribution of malicious software, viruses etc.  84. Conducting traffic management measures in order to preserve integrity and security of the network  could basically consist of restricting connectivity or blocking of traffic to and from specific endpoints.  Typical examples of such traffic management measures include:  • blocking of IP addresses, or ranges of them, because they are well-known sources of attacks;  • blocking of IP addresses from which an actual attack is originating;  • blocking of IP addresses/IAS showing suspicious behaviour (e.g. unauthorised communication with  network components, address spoofing);  blocking of IP addresses where there are clear indications that they are part of a bot network;  • blocking of specific port numbers which constitute a threat to security and integrity.  85. NRAs should consider that, in order to identify attacks and activate security measures, the use of  security monitoring systems by ISPs is often justified. In such cases, the monitoring of traffic to detect  security threats (such as those listed in paragraph 84) may be implemented in the background on a  continuous basis, while the actual traffic management measure preserving integrity and security is  triggered only when concrete security threats are detected. Therefore, the precondition “only for as long as  necessary” does not preclude implementation of such monitoring of the integrity and security of the  network.  86. Besides monitoring the integrity and security of the network, possible security threats may also be  identified on the basis of reports/complaints from end-users or blocking lists from recognised security  organisations.  87. This exception could be used as a basis for circumvention of the Regulation because security is a broad  concept. NRAs should therefore carefully assess whether the requirements of this exception are met and to  request that ISPs provide adequate justifications when necessary.”  3 BEREC Guidelines on the Implementation by National Regulators of European Net Neutrality Rules  https://berec.europa.eu/eng/document_register/subject_matter/berec/regulatory_best_practices/guidelines/6160- berec-guidelines-on-the-implementation-by-national-regulators-of-european-net-neutrality-rules  Guideline on assessing security measures in the context of Article  3(3) of the Open Internet regulation  Version 1.0 - December 2018  08  3. Evaluating the necessity of security measures  This section provides guidance for NRAs in evaluating the necessity of security measures and contains   A list of evaluation factors that could be taken into account by NRAs,   A checklist for evaluating the factors and weighing the pros and cons of a measure,   A justification form, which could be used by NRAs to collect information from providers  3.1 Evaluation factors  Providers of internet access services need to have appropriate security measures in place. To keep their  networks and services secure they continuously make risk assessments about security threats, risks and  measures. Following a risk assessment, a provider may decide that a certain security measure is necessary  to protect the networks, the services using the network, or end-user equipment. This risk assessment takes  into account many factors, including the severity of the threat, the cost and complexity of a measure, side- effects etc.  NRAs may need to assess whether or not a certain security measure is justified, for example following a  complaint by an end-user. In general, this assessment requires a case-by-case evaluation, because it depends  on circumstances, which are specific for that provider. It is impossible to make an exhaustive or prescriptive  list of security measures that are justified.  NRAs could take into account the following factors when evaluating if a security measure is necessary:  1) Security risk – the security risk for the network, services, and/or end-user equipment  2) Effectiveness - the effectiveness of the security measure in reducing the risk  3) Proportionality  - the proportionality of the measure, i.e. limited in time and scope, few side-effects  4) Appropriateness – the appropriateness of the measure, i.e. in line with industry good practices  The evaluation factors are explained in more detail below.  3.1.1 Security risk  A security risk, associated with a threat, is high if the potential impact of the threat is high and the likelihood  that the threat materializes is high. In this context, what matters is the risk for the network, services, and/or  the end-user equipment. If the security risk is not high, then the security measure may not be justifiable.  Questions to ask:   How severe and urgent is the security threat?   What is the potential impact of the security threat?   What is the likelihood that the security threat materializes and has an impact?  To assess security risk one must look at both the likelihood and the impact. Threats with a low potential  impact and a low probability, for instance, are minor risks. Threats with high probability and high impact are  major risks. Annex B includes a standard table to rate risks based on likelihood and impact.  3.1.2 Effectiveness  A security measure is effective if it reduces the security risk (see above) significantly. If the measure does  not reduce the risk by much, then the security measure may not be justifiable. Questions to ask:   To what extent is the risk mitigated when the security measure is implemented?   What would the impact be on the network, services and customers if the measure is not applied?  Guideline on assessing security measures in the context of Article  3(3) of the Open Internet regulation  Version 1.0 - December 2018  09   What is the residual risk?  3.1.3 Proportionality  A security measure is proportional when it mitigates the threat effectively, without too many side-effects.  In the context of the net neutrality rules it is important to assess the impact of the measure on competing  services, on ‘good’ network traffic, ‘normal’ use of end-user equipment, etc. If the security measure blocks  a lot of ‘good’ network traffic or if the blocking disables an entire network protocol or software  application, then the security measure may not be justifiable. Questions to ask:   Is the scope of the measure limited to specific traffic, networks, or end-user?   What is the duration, is the measure time-limited?   Is there impact on ‘good’ network traffic and legitimate services (false positives)?   Is there impact for the end-users?  3.1.4 Appropriateness  A security measure is appropriate when it is the right measure for this risk, considering the threat landscape,  the technology, industry standards and good practices, alternatives solutions, etc. Questions to ask:   Is the measure considered the appropriate measure to mitigate this threat/risk?   Is the measure recommended in industry good practices or standards?   Are there alternatives that are more effective or more proportionate?  As mentioned already, whether or not a security measure is justifiable as being necessary depends on the  circumstances. Providers will need to do a risk assessment and evaluate this on a case-by–case basis. Also, the NRAs  may need to evaluate if a security measure is justifiable, by looking at all the factors, weighing the pros and the cons.  The table below gives some examples of how these factors could weigh in an evaluation.  FACTORS MORE JUSTIFIED (+) LESS JUSTIFIED (-)  Security risk The risk is major The risk is minor  Effectiveness Residual risk is significantly reduced.  Residual risk hardly changed. Risks before and  after are similar.  Proportionality Targeted scope and duration, few side-effects.  Blunt and wide-ranging, many side-effects, lots  of good traffic and services are blocked.  Appropriateness  It is a common approach, an industry good  practice. No alternatives.  It is an unusual measure for mitigating this  threat. Usually done differently.  3.2 Evaluation checklist  An NRA may receive a complaint or be otherwise triggered to investigate if a security measure is justifiable  under the net neutrality rules. NRAs can use the evaluation factors in an evaluation procedure, for example  as part of an evaluation checklist. We give an example checklist below.  EVALUATION CHECKLIST  Security measure summary  Provider(s) involved, network/services in scope, summary of security measure  Guideline on assessing security measures in the context of Article  3(3) of the Open Internet regulation  Version 1.0 - December 2018  10  EVALUATION CHECKLIST  Evaluation factors  Security risk ++, +, -, or -- Details  Effectiveness ++, +, -, or -- Details  Proportionality ++, +, -, or -- Details  Appropriateness ++, +, -, or -- Details  Overall conclusion  The security measure can/cannot be justified under the security exception in the net  neutrality rules, because…  Recommendation for provider(s)  3.3 Justification form  As part of an evaluation, NRAs may need to collect information from providers about security measures in  place. This section proposes a justification form for collecting and structuring the relevant information about  a security measure. Providers could also use this justification form as part of internal processes, to document  the reasoning and justification behind security measures.

Side-effects,  communication  and opt-out  Side-effects  Limited side-effects because network  management is usually not done via the  WAN. Some business users may be using  SNMP.  Communication  Measure explained and listed at:  www.homenet.com/security  Opt-out Yes, opt-out available – upon request.  Below we show an example of how to use the evaluation factors in an assessment.  FACTORS PROS CONS  Security risk  There is a major risk for the terminal equipment  of end-users, of infection of their PCs.  There is a major risk for the ISP services, because  these infections are used to create DDoS attacks  causing outages.  Effectiveness  Very effective. Measure prevents spreading of  infection and reduces DDoS attacks (using SNMP  reflection).  Proportionality  Limited side effects, because SNMP is used for  network management which is usually not done  over a WAN connection.  Guideline on assessing security measures in the context of Article  3(3) of the Open Internet regulation  Version 1.0 - December 2018  16  FACTORS PROS CONS  Duration of the measure is time-limited (1 year)  Appropriateness  Measure is mentioned as an industry good  practice  Ideally, remotely exploitable vulnerabilities in  devices should be addressed by the device  manufacturers and operating system vendors,  not the telecom operator.  Guideline on assessing security measures in the context of Article  3(3) of the Open Internet regulation  Version 1.0 - December 2018  17  Annex B: Risk assessment  Risk is usually rated by taking the product of likelihood (probability) and impact. The table below is based  on the ISO27005 standard for risk management. In this table, both probability and impact are rated from  1- very low, 2-low, 3-medium, 4-high, to 5-very high.  The resulting scale for risk is minor (green), significant (yellow), major (red) and the risk of threats with a  very high impact and a low or very low probability are rated separately, with black. These threats need to  be handled with care, because although the chances that these threats materialize are low, the impact  may be very high (so-called black swans).

    "abstract": "This guideline regards the security exceptions in the EU net neutrality rules. It offers a checklist and an evaluation form to help NRAs in deciding whether or not a provider is allowed to take a security measure, for example blocking certain traffic, to protect the security of networks, services using the networks, or end-user equipment. This guideline has been developed in close collaboration with the telecoms regulatory authorities in the Article 13a Expert Group and the BEREC Expert Group on Net Neutrality."

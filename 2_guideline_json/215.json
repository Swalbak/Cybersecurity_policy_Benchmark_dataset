Moreover, market data on cybersecurity products, services and processes are scarcely taken  into account in the cybersecurity development lifecycle, e.g., within decision-making  processes for the launching and development of cybersecurity initiatives, product ideas, policy  actions, research funding and deployments. According to Article 8 par. 7 of the Cybersecurity  Act (CSA)1, ENISA has been tasked to “perform and disseminate regular analyses of the main  trends in the cybersecurity market on both the demand and supply sides, with a view to  fostering the cybersecurity market in the Union”.  This document is the cornerstone of ENISA activities in analysing the EU cybersecurity  market. It presents a cybersecurity market analysis framework, a guidance, on how EU  cybersecurity market analyses can be performed and be:  • More transparent: a better structuring of the analysis method and understanding of  the market, market trends and stakeholders lead to more transparency regarding the  results of the analysis.  • More comparable: a structured analysis process makes results more comparable and  reusable.  • More customisable towards technology and market trends: the updated market  analysis framework can be better customised to take account of trends and dynamics  in the cybersecurity market as well as forecasts, market gaps and market niches.  • More agile: the inherent flexibility of setting the market analysis focus and adapting  the analysis process to the needs increases the agility of the proposed market  analysis method.  • More comprehensive: the inclusion of possible variables, criteria and contextual  information on cybersecurity, as well as requirements and dependencies both from  the supply and the demand sides, increases the comprehensiveness of the proposed  market analysis method.  • More coherent: the framework facilitates information exchanges of specific market  analysis reports, their re-usability and coherence of both raw market data and the  analysis of the results.  This framework is subject to future iterations. With increasing performance of cybersecurity  market analyses and interactions with stakeholders, ENISA will further develop and update  the current framework to increase its efficacy and practicability.  The framework comprises seven major steps to help the analyst conduct a cybersecurity  market analysis, as follows:  Step 1 – Choose the market segment for analysis  Step 2 – Scope the market segment analysis  Step 3 – Analyse the market segment  Step 4 – Decide what to ask stakeholders  Step 5 – Collect the data  Step 6 – Analyse the data  Step 7 – Disseminate the results.  1 Regulation (EU) 2019/ of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17 April 2019 on ENISA (the European  Union Agency for Cybersecurity) and on information and communications technology cybersecurity certification and  repealing Regulation (EU) No 526/2013,  https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal- content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32019R0881&from=EN.  https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32019R0881&from=EN https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32019R0881&from=EN  ENISA CYBERSECURITY MARKET ANALYSIS FRAMEWORK V2.0  Final | Version 2.0 | Public | March 2023  8  The framework is targeted at supporting various stakeholders, including the following2:  • EU institutions, bodies and agencies (EUIBAs)  • National public authorities, especially cybersecurity authorities  • Industry  • Companies providing cybersecurity products, services and/or processes (supply  side)  • Companies needing cybersecurity products, services and/or processes (demand  side)  • Consumer organisations and associations  • Research institutions  • Other ENISA stakeholders.  Depending on their requirements, market analyses could have different types of users and  stakeholders.  2 There are different ways of grouping. Another way of grouping stakeholders could for instance include: SMEs, Clients  and Customers, Supply chain participants, and End-users.  ENISA CYBERSECURITY MARKET ANALYSIS FRAMEWORK V2.0  Final | Version 2.0 | Public | March 2023  9  INTRODUCTION  What distinguishes the conduct of a cybersecurity market analysis from any other market  analysis?  Cybersecurity is inherently about security, hence, the rules governing the market are  different from those selling toothpaste. Some details may be confidential.3 Many of those  with whom the cybersecurity market analyst would like to consult may not wish to reveal  much information. It may be challenging to gather the data to make an informed market  analysis and informed decision about whether to enter the market.  Such sensitivities may be at work on both the demand side (those wishing to procure a  cybersecurity solution) and on the supply side (those wishing to sell their solutions), which  may complicate the high-level analysis of both sides undertaken by public authorities and  industry associations.  Some cybersecurity products, services or processes may be subject to secrecy obligations  or commercial sensitivities. Some products may raise social concerns such as the  navigation systems on our smart phones that allow the big companies to know where we  are and often what we are doing (picking up the kids from school, going shopping, hanging  out at the gym, going for a drink with colleagues).  Cybersecurity solutions, needs and requirements are often kept confidential so that hackers  and attackers are not tipped off about the actions of the defender.  Unlike many other markets, the cybersecurity market is highly competitive, as the European  Council has determined that it is populated by 60,000 companies4 – some niche companies  and some full-service companies.  The sensitive nature of cybersecurity for companies means a general unwillingness to share  data and information. This difficult access to information is compounded by the fact that the  cybersecurity market is a diluted and fragmented market – diluted because it is often part of  or embedded within other markets – fragmented because it is composed of a myriad of  actors.  Given the considerable multiplicity of cybersecurity products, services and processes, a  credible cybersecurity market analysis may need to go significantly deeper than other  market analyses. Furthermore, cybersecurity is dynamic; it is evolving constantly as  attackers adopt new technologies and new strategies to carry out their attacks.  Cybersecurity functions are often a component within existing products, services and  processes. A detailed decomposition is often needed to assess various market  characteristics of products, such as role, level of market penetration, and market value.  Until recently, market analyses and assessments have been performed mainly by experts  with an economics background. Cybersecurity market analysis, however, requires a  significant, multi-disciplinary, technically oriented, cybersecurity knowledge. A multi-  disciplinary approach helps address the challenges of defining the boundaries of different  3 Confidential here does not explicitly refer to EU classification levels, although it could. The main point is to hide or  guard sensitive data against potential attackers.  4 https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/policies/cybersecurity/#funding  https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/policies/cybersecurity/#funding  ENISA CYBERSECURITY MARKET ANALYSIS FRAMEWORK V2.0  Final | Version 2.0 | Public | March 2023  10  cybersecurity market segments. Hence, there are many differences between the conduct of  a cybersecurity market analysis and other types of market analysis.  This new version of the ECSMAF Version 2.0 (V2.0) is an evolution of the ECSMAF Version  1.0 (V1.0)5 with the lessons learned from the pilots, i.e. the ENISA EU Cybersecurity Market  Analysis - IoT in Distribution Grids6 and the Cloud Cybersecurity Market Analysis 7, and the  contributions of the ENISA AHWG on EU Cybersecurity Market. More evolutions are  expected, as ENISA continues to improve its guidance to cybersecurity stakeholders. Future  analyses will be able to use V2.0 as a guidance and, in due course, V3.0. Hence, some  differences in the structures and approaches of the cybersecurity market analyses based on  this framework are inevitable in this still evolving stage.  AIMS OF THIS FRAMEWORK  This cybersecurity market analysis framework aims to:  • perform \"analyses of the main trends in the cybersecurity market on both the  demand and supply sides, with a view to fostering the cybersecurity market in the  Union\"8;  • define a method for market analysts for  o analysing cybersecurity market segments;  o amalgamating knowledge from cybersecurity market analyses;  • serve as a guide for any stakeholder undertaking a cybersecurity market analysis.  This framework is mainly intended to help ENISA and its stakeholders:  • identify cybersecurity fields that are innovative, emerging and have potential for  both demand and supply;  • identify cybersecurity market investment opportunities and risks based on demand  and supply requirements;  • help promote an EU-based security market and its objectives by analysing and  monitoring the EU cybersecurity market and its evolution;  • assess the importance of market segments in the context of potential threats and  vulnerabilities;  • assess market needs for cybersecurity certification; and  • leverage cybersecurity market data for informed policy decisions regarding  cybersecurity within the EU and Member States;  • support the European cybersecurity market analysts by applying more rigour and a  more comprehensive, structured approach to the analysis of the market prospects  for new products, services and/or processes.  TARGET AUDIENCE  We have prepared this framework as an aide to those who wish to undertake an analysis of  a cybersecurity market segment.  We can distinguish two types of customers or users of the ECSMAF: those with a fixed  budget who have to adapt their strategy to their budget and those (high assurance)  customers for whom budget is not the main limitation whereas assurance is.  We especially address market analysts, a term that we use in a broad sense and not  confined to the private sector. On the contrary, we are especially addressing market  analysts who work for the institutions listed below. These institutions are interested in a  5 ENISA, ENISA Cybersecurity Market Analysis Framework (ECSMAF), Version 1.0,  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/enisa-cybersecurity-market-analysis-framework-ecsmaf.  6 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/eu-cybersecurity-market-analysis-iot-in-distribution-grid  7 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/cloud-cybersecurity-market-analysis  8 Art. 8 par. 7 of the CSA, https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32019R0881&from=EN.  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/enisa-cybersecurity-market-analysis-framework-ecsmaf https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/eu-cybersecurity-market-analysis-iot-in-distribution-grid https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/cloud-cybersecurity-market-analysis https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32019R0881&from=EN  ENISA CYBERSECURITY MARKET ANALYSIS FRAMEWORK V2.0  Final | Version 2.0 | Public | March 2023  11  higher level view of the markets, both the demand and supply sides, than individual  companies who are more interested in the prospects for their product, service or process.  Nevertheless, while companies are not the main targeted stakeholders, they too may find  that this framework provides a useful tool.  The framework is targeted at supporting the following stakeholders:  • EU institutions, bodies and agencies (EUIBAs), e.g., the European Commission  and its Directorates Generals, such as DG-CNECT, DG-GROW, DG-JRC, DG-  RTD, DG-TRADE, but also Eurostat9 and the European Cybersecurity  Competence Centre (ECCC)10. EU regulations and impact assessments often take  into account market issues. Market analyses are important to help policymakers  understand trends as well as related demand and supply issues. Market analyses  can help shape future calls in Horizon Europe and other EU programmes where  there are market gaps.  • National public authorities, especially cybersecurity authorities. Cybersecurity  market surveillance is subject to regulation. The framework and its application may  help in comparative market analyses and identifying shared efforts between the  Member States.  • ENISA stakeholder groups, e.g., the European Cybersecurity Certification Group  (ECCG)11, Stakeholder Cybersecurity Certification Group (SCCG)12, and ENISA  Advisory Group13. The framework may support decision-making for prioritising  certification efforts and spotting market gaps.  • Industry and cross-sectoral associations, e.g., TIC Council14, the European Cyber  Security Organisation (ECSO)15 and the Information Security Forum (ISF)16.  Industry and professional associations can use the framework to analyse market  opportunities, trends, challenges and vulnerabilities and the creation of competitive  advantages to EU industry players.  • Consumer organisations and associations, e.g., European Association for  Coordinating Consumer Representation in Standardisation (ANEC)17 and the  European Consumer Organisation (BEUC)18. By using this framework, such  organisations may assess the needs and requirements of consumers for  cybersecurity products, services and processes, and their prospects in the  European cybersecurity market.  • Research institutions may use the proposed methodology to assess the maturity of  existing products and markets and guide the development of new technologies and  services.  • Companies providing cybersecurity products, services and/or processes (supply  side). As noted above, the European Council has estimated that there are 60,000  such companies in Europe. Some are major companies who already conduct  sophisticated market analyses, but by far the majority could benefit from some  market analysis advice. For some companies, cybersecurity is their principal  business; for others, it is just one line of business among others.  • Companies who need cybersecurity technologies, products, services and/or  processes (demand side). Such companies may have information security  professionals and/or procurement personnel who need to improve their companies’  cybersecurity. Hence, they need to analyse what is available on the market to meet  their needs and requirements.  9 https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat  10 https://cybersecurity-centre.europa.eu/index_en  11 https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/cybersecurity-certification-group  12 https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/stakeholder-cybersecurity-certification-group  13 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/about-enisa/structure-organization/advisory-group  14 https://www.tic-council.org/  15 https://ecs-org.eu/  16 https://www.securityforum.org/  17 https://www.anec.eu  18 https://www.beuc.eu  https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat https://cybersecurity-centre.europa.eu/index_en https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/cybersecurity-certification-group https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/stakeholder-cybersecurity-certification-group https://www.enisa.europa.eu/about-enisa/structure-organization/advisory-group https://www.tic-council.org/ https://ecs-org.eu/ https://www.securityforum.org/ https://www.anec.eu/ https://www.beuc.eu/  ENISA CYBERSECURITY MARKET ANALYSIS FRAMEWORK V2.0  Final | Version 2.0 | Public | March 2023  12  • Venture capitalists, to make them aware of investment opportunities in the  cybersecurity realm.  POLICY CONTEXT  ENISA supports cybersecurity market analysis in line with Article 8 and Title III of the  Cybersecurity Act (CSA), which stipulates that consideration of developments in the  cybersecurity market is a focus of the legislation, in particular, in the context of certification.  The CSA considers certification as a main instrument for “avoiding the fragmentation of the  internal market”19. The goal of cybersecurity certification is “to improve the functioning of the  internal market” (Art. 56 CSA). To achieve this goal, the CSA foresees actions to analyse  market trends. The CSA says that:  • “ENISA shall perform and disseminate regular analyses of the main trends in the  cybersecurity market on both the demand and supply sides, with a view to  fostering the cybersecurity market in the Union” (Art. 8 par. 7 CSA);  • “ENISA should develop and maintain a ‘market observatory’ by performing regular  analyses and disseminating information on the main trends in the cybersecurity  market, on both the demand and supply sides” (Recital 42 CSA).  In performing these tasks, ENISA receives advice and guidance from the Stakeholder  Cybersecurity Certification Group (SCCG). The SCCG “upon request, advise[s] ENISA on  general and strategic matters concerning ENISA’s tasks relating to market, cybersecurity  certification, and standardisation” (Art. 22 par. 3 (b) CSA).  The ENISA work on the EU cybersecurity market aims to contribute to the reduction in EU  internal market fragmentation and to provide input to:  • the Union Rolling Work Programme for European Cybersecurity Certification by  means of “market demand” (Art. 47 CSA);  • the promotion of “the use of European cybersecurity certification, with a view to  avoiding the fragmentation of the internal market. ENISA shall contribute to the  establishment and maintenance of a European cybersecurity certification  framework in accordance with Title III of this Regulation, with a view to increasing  the transparency of the cybersecurity of ICT products, ICT services and ICT  processes, thereby strengthening trust in the digital internal market and its  competitiveness” (Art 4.6 CSA).  Moreover, based on market information, ENISA can provide support in the coordination of  the Member States’ efforts in market surveillance for supervision of certification.20 The CSA  provides that:  • The national cybersecurity certification authorities “supervise and enforce rules  included in European cybersecurity certification scheme [...] for the monitoring of  the compliance of ICT products, ICT services and ICT processes with the  requirements of the European cybersecurity certificates that have been issued in  their respective territories, in cooperation with other relevant market surveillance  authorities” (Art. 58 par 7 (a) CSA).  Some EU legislative initiatives that are worth it to be mentioned because they might be of  relevance to the cybersecurity market are the following:  19 See Article 1 par. 1 (b) CSA.  20 Since this effort concerns compliance issues of certification, it may be used as a tool to obtain valuable information  on various aspects of the cybersecurity market. ENISA will coordinate efforts with Member States and the Commission  to increase the usability of this source within the context of the Activity 7 of the ENISA Single Programming Document  (SPD) 2022-2024. https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/corporate-documents/enisa-single-programming- document-2022-2024.  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/corporate-documents/enisa-single-programming-document-2022-2024 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/corporate-documents/enisa-single-programming-document-2022-2024  ENISA CYBERSECURITY MARKET ANALYSIS FRAMEWORK V2.0  Final | Version 2.0 | Public | March 2023  13  • The proposed Cyber Resilience Act (CRA)21 that foresees an obligation for the  manufacturers and vendors to comply with cybersecurity requirements to address  market needs and protect consumers from insecure products and services. It will  introduce common cybersecurity rules for connected products and associated  services. The CRA will complement the NIS2 Directive and the Cybersecurity Act.  It will also complement the Delegated Regulation of 29 October 2021 under the  Radio Equipment Directive, by setting up streamlined cybersecurity requirements  covering a wide range of digital products and their ancillary services.  • The proposed new Directive on the security of network and information systems  (NIS2) that is “part of a package of measures to further improve the resilience and  incident response capacities of public and private entities, competent authorities  and the EU as a whole. It covers the field of cybersecurity and critical infrastructure  protection“.22  The ENISA Single Programming Document 2022-2024 (SPD)23 takes account of these  provisions and sets up corresponding actions under Activity 7, with the aim of fostering  “a cybersecurity market (products and services) in the EU and the development of  the cybersecurity industry and services, in particular SMEs and start-ups, to reduce  the dependence from outside the Union and to reinforce supply chains inside the  Union. It involves actions to promote and implement ‘security by design’ and  ‘security by default’ measures in ICT products, services and processes, including  through standardisation”.  By delivering information on the cybersecurity market, ENISA provides support towards  implementation of various European Commission initiatives helping companies (SMEs,  micro-enterprises) improve business and production processes, products or services using  digital technologies. Examples of such initiatives include:  • European Digital Innovation Hubs24: market analyses provide evidence towards  helping “SMEs expand and tap into other markets, develop EU value chains,  create new business opportunities for companies or help commercialise earlier  innovation experiments or pilots”25;  • Emerging industries and value chains26: market analysis is an important instrument  that may “help SMEs to innovate and develop cross-sectoral value chains by  bringing different sectors and areas of expertise together to create new value  chains across the EU and Horizon 2020 associated countries”.  To respond to the above exigencies, ENISA began analysing the cybersecurity market, as  stipulated by the CSA. It created an Ad Hoc Working Group (AHWG) on the EU  Cybersecurity Market27 and published in April 2022 the first version of the ENISA  Cybersecurity Market Analysis Framework Version 1.0 (ECSMAF V1.0), the output of which  was intended to facilitate market analysis.28 This updated framework – Version 2.0  (ECSMAF V2.0) is the successor to the ECSMAF V1.0. There are quite some differences  between V1.0 and V2.0, partly based on the pilots29 of the ECSMAF V1.0 and the feedback  21 Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on horizontal cybersecurity requirements  for products with digital elements and amending Regulation (EU) 2019/1020. https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/better- regulation/have-your-say/initiatives/13410-Cyber-resilience-act-new-cybersecurity-rules-for-digital-products-and- ancillary-services_en . Possible future versions of the ECSMAF may recommend to consider goals and (measurable)  effects from the CRA more explicitly.  22 https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/nis-directive  23 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/corporate-documents/enisa-single-programming-document-2022-2024  24 https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/activities/edihs.  25 https://ec.europa.eu/newsroom/dae/document.cfm?doc_id=70324.  26 https://ec.europa.eu/growth/industry/strategy/cluster-policy/emerging-industries-and-value-chains_en.  27 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/market/ad-hoc-working-group-on-cybersecurity-market  28 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/enisa-cybersecurity-market-analysis-framework-ecsmaf  29 The EU Cybersecurity Market Analysis - IoT in Distribution Grids, available at  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/eu-cybersecurity-market-analysis-iot-in-distribution-grid and the Cloud  Cybersecurity Market Analysis, available at https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/cloud-cybersecurity-market- analysis.  https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/better-regulation/have-your-say/initiatives/13410-Cyber-resilience-act-new-cybersecurity-rules-for-digital-products-and-ancillary-services_en https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/better-regulation/have-your-say/initiatives/13410-Cyber-resilience-act-new-cybersecurity-rules-for-digital-products-and-ancillary-services_en https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/better-regulation/have-your-say/initiatives/13410-Cyber-resilience-act-new-cybersecurity-rules-for-digital-products-and-ancillary-services_en https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/nis-directive https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/corporate-documents/enisa-single-programming-document-2022-2024 https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/activities/edihs https://ec.europa.eu/newsroom/dae/document.cfm?doc_id=70324 https://ec.europa.eu/growth/industry/strategy/cluster-policy/emerging-industries-and-value-chains_en https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/market/ad-hoc-working-group-on-cybersecurity-market https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/enisa-cybersecurity-market-analysis-framework-ecsmaf https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/eu-cybersecurity-market-analysis-iot-in-distribution-grid https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/cloud-cybersecurity-market-analysis https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/cloud-cybersecurity-market-analysis  ENISA CYBERSECURITY MARKET ANALYSIS FRAMEWORK V2.0  Final | Version 2.0 | Public | March 2023  14  from stakeholders, and partly because the authors of V2.0 wanted a simpler, easier-to-  grasp framework.  ENISA CYBERSECURITY MARKET ANALYSIS FRAMEWORK V2.0  Final | Version 2.0 | Public | March 2023  15  HOW TO USE THIS FRAMEWORK  The framework consists of seven steps, which the market analyst can follow for identifying a  segment of the cybersecurity market to be analysed and for conducting the analysis.  Step 1: Choose the market segment for analysis  Step 2: Scope the market segment for analysis  Step 3: Analyse the market segment  Step 4: Decide what to ask stakeholders  Step 5: Collect the data  Step 6: Analyse the data  Step 7: Disseminate the results  Figure 1: Cybersecurity market analysis steps and actions  ENISA CYBERSECURITY MARKET ANALYSIS FRAMEWORK V2.0  Final | Version 2.0 | Public | March 2023  16  The first two steps of a cybersecurity market analysis are: Step 1 - Choose the market  segment for analysis and Step 2 - Scope the market segment for analysis. These steps set  the parameters of the analysis. These parameters set the topic, breadth and depth of the  analysis and determine the resources needed for the study, whether in terms of time,  budget, human resources or tools. The third step – Step 3 – Analyse the market segment –  consists of a closer look at the market segment and all its elements, ranging from the  infrastructure or architecture of the supply chains, value chain and value stack, assets,  threats to those assets, safety controls protecting the assets as well as a snapshot of the  major market segment actors. The combined outputs of Steps 1, 2 and 3 influence the  structured formulation of questions in Step 4 – Decide what to ask stakeholders that take  into account the scope of the analysis, the elements of the market segment and the types of  stakeholders who will answer the questions. Step 5 – Collect the data is the actual process  of data collection, using the questions developed in Step 4, but also the use of other primary  and secondary research. Following data collection, Step 6 – Analyse the data represents a  methodical analysis of the data, including an analysis of patterns and the formation of topics  or outputs of the analysis. Step 7 – Disseminate the results involves careful consideration of  how these outputs are presented, including the consideration of potential audiences,  timelines, formats, etc.  The market analyst can follow the steps sequentially, carrying out the first and then the next  and so on. However, we have provided a detailed table of contents so that the market  analyst can refer to particular sections or subsections without needing to follow the whole  process if he or she does not need to do so. Each step and this current “How to use this  Framework” chapter has some explanatory text followed by some questions, marked off in a  blue box, to help the analyst undertake the analysis. The questions are intended to be  indicative. Others can be added.  All of the steps involve iterative horizontal activities, in particular Validation with  stakeholders and Contextualisation.  Concerning Validation, in Step 1 of the analysis, the market analyst consults stakeholders  and/or his or her managers who have sponsored or will benefit from the study on which  market segments should be analysed. In Step 2, the market analyst, in consultation with  stakeholders (internal and external), selects the criteria to be used in scoping the market  analysis. In Step 3, the analyst describes the market segment to be analysed, which may  require validation or consultation with external stakeholders, such as cybersecurity or  industry experts. In Step 4, the market analyst develops questions to gather the views of  stakeholders while keeping in mind that the questions to be asked will likely need to be  tailored to the particular stakeholder types. In Step 5, the analyst collects and processes  data from a variety of sources, including responses to the questions from stakeholders. The  analyst may usefully invite the stakeholders interviewed to review the synthesis. Step 6 is  about analysing the data collected. In Step 7, the market analyst selects which visualisation  methods to use and presents the results to stakeholders, external or internal to their  organisation, for final sign-off.  Concerning  Contextualisation, the market analyst should pay attention to:  − what is happening in the overall economy, especially with regard to market  characteristics such as market dynamics, competition, ownership, profitability, all  of which could affect the cybersecurity market segment being analysed;  − macro-environmental, political, regulatory and social factors since they impact the  cybersecurity market;  − the state of the art in technology research, trends in going beyond the state of the  art, and how an emerging technology might impact the market;  − the importance of the different segments from a disruption viewpoint. The main  issue with cybersecurity attacks is that they can disrupt a small retail shop or a  whole economy. A successful cyberattack on a small retail shop will not have the  ENISA CYBERSECURITY MARKET ANALYSIS FRAMEWORK V2.0  Final | Version 2.0 | Public | March 2023  17  same impact on the economy as one that disables energy or water supplies or  even defence systems.  While using this framework, the analyst should keep in mind the internal organisation of the  entity he or she is conducting the analysis for as well as the project management cycle that  the organisation follows, and engage relevant experts in the analysis as deemed  appropriate.  In addition to the above sections, the framework has several annexes to which the reader  can turn for more detail on specific aspects relevant for analysis of a particular market  segment.  To help the analyst undertake the analysis, we have added some reference questions, which  are indicative only; others can be added.  Questions:  • Are you clear on the objectives or purposes or aims of the market analysis you are  about to undertake?  • Have you formulated and agreed them with your senior managers?  • If you have been handed the objectives, have you asked yourself if they are clearly  written or could be revised to make them more precise?  • Do you and/or your team have the flexibility to deal with ad hoc or urgent requests  (new or modified objectives) as a result of an incident with far-reaching impacts?  • Have you considered for whom you will be conducting your cybersecurity market  analysis? Are your targets only people internal to your organisation or do they  include other decision-makers?  • Have you consulted or are you planning to consult with stakeholders to gather their  perspective on particular market segments, their growth prospects, the  opportunities for European industry?  • Do you foresee that your market analysis might be shared with others outside your  organisation?  • Have you developed a comprehensive contact list of target stakeholders?  • Have you read the whole of this framework? Do you know which bits you want to  use?  • Can you apply the framework for the analysis of your particular market segments?  • Are there any commercially confidential aspects of your market analysis that might  affect its distribution?  • Have you considered the workflow for implementing the market analysis?  ENISA CYBERSECURITY MARKET ANALYSIS FRAMEWORK V2.0  Final | Version 2.0 | Public | March 2023  18  STEP 1: CHOOSE THE MARKET  SEGMENT FOR ANALYSIS  If a market analyst is going to conduct a market analysis, he or she should first determine  what is the goal, the purpose, the objective of the analysis. The market analyst should  identify relevant potential market segments for analysis and choose which to pursue. The  ‘cybersecurity market’ is of vast proportions, especially when one considers the number of  existing and emerging technologies, users, types of cyber threats, cybersecurity providers  and solutions. The complexity of the cybersecurity market requires segmentation of the  market for more manageable analysis. The first step in a cybersecurity market analysis is  thus to broadly scan the cybersecurity market and identify the segments, technologies  and/or services of interest to the governmental authority, industry association or other  stakeholder for whom the analysis is to be undertaken. Market segments can revolve  around the supply chain of a technological product or a service, for example, cloud services,  5G networks, Internet of Things (IoT) products and services, etc. Surveying the market will  help determine whether some intervention or regulation or support is needed in the market.  This step includes the following actions:  • Establish the goal of the market analysis  • Assess the priorities  • Develop and assess validation criteria  • Identify the infrastructure and the stakeholders.  ESTABLISH THE GOAL OF THE MARKET ANALYSIS  The market analyst should clarify the goal of the market analysis to be conducted. The goal  should be as specific and concise as possible. The goal may be driven by legislation (e.g.,  the CSA). He or she should recognise that the goal may (need to) be recalibrated at a  subsequent step. The goal and scope of the analysis are linked. This framework is intended  for use at both macro and micro levels. By macro, we mean at industry or market segment  scale; by micro, we mean an individual technology or product, service or process.  ASSESS THE PRIORITIES  The market segment to be analysed may be chosen in different ways – suggested by  colleagues or experts or stakeholders30 or, in the instance of industry and consumer  associations, by their members. Funding opportunities or incentives, such as tax or R&D  credits, may factor in the setting of priorities. In smaller enterprises, the segment can be  assigned by company strategy or upper management, so the market analyst may have little  choice in the matter. In some instances, the markets to be analysed may be impelled by  legislation, such as the CSA31 or the proposed AI Act32 or proposed Cyber Resilience Act33.  The initial survey of the market may produce several market segments of interest. In such  scenarios, when choice is plenty, a transparent way of deciding the segment to be analysed  is to use a priority scoring table, like the one below. In this table, the market analyst can  either singlehandedly or as part of a working group or panel assign numeric values (1 to x)  30 https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/library/cyber-resilience-act. In the instance of ENISA, for example, a request  for priorities would be sent to the National Liaison Officers Network, the Advisory Group, the Ad Hoc Working Group  (AHWG) on the EU Cybersecurity Market Analysis, or ENISA internal stakeholders (all Units).  31 https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/ALL/?uri=CELEX%3A32019R0881  32 https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/library/proposal-regulation-laying-down-harmonised-rules-artificial- intelligence  33 https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=COM:2022:454:FIN  https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/library/cyber-resilience-act https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/ALL/?uri=CELEX%3A32019R0881 https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/library/proposal-regulation-laying-down-harmonised-rules-artificial-intelligence https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/library/proposal-regulation-laying-down-harmonised-rules-artificial-intelligence https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=COM:2022:454:FIN  ENISA CYBERSECURITY MARKET ANALYSIS FRAMEWORK V2.0  Final | Version 2.0 | Public | March 2023  19  or qualitative values (low, medium, high) to the relevance, impact or urgency of particular  segments. The added scores will produce a priority list and the first market segment on that  list becomes the chosen focus of the cybersecurity market analysis.  Table 1: Example of scoring cybersecurity market segment priorities  Proposed  market  segment  Threat/  urgency/  [optional  category]  Market  share/impact/need  (Supply)  Market share/impact/need  (Demand)  Relevance  for  analyst’s  company/  organisati on  Total  Big  comp anies  SMEs Macro  level  Big  compa nies  SMEs Macro  level  Market  segment A  Market  segment B  Market  segment C  Market  segment D  High relevance: 3 points; Medium relevance: 2 points; Low relevance: 1 point  In the example table, the first column lists the multiple market segments that the market  analyst shortlisted. The columns to the right are for illustration purposes and may be  adapted to the needs and triggers of the market analysis. The scores are tallied in the  rightmost column and the top scoring market segment is chosen for analysis.  DEVELOP AND ASSESS VALIDATION CRITERIA  As the market analyst contemplates the market segment to be analysed, he or she should  already be thinking about relevant criteria for validation of the market analysis, how to  assess different proposals from stakeholders for priorities to analyse and validating the  choice of segment to be analysed34. The criteria referenced in Step 2 and Annex 3 draw on  those mentioned in the first version of the ECSMAF.  IDENTIFY THE INFRASTRUCTURE AND THE STAKEHOLDERS  As the market analyst identifies the market segment, he or she should also identify the  infrastructure at stake, the value chain and value stack of the domain and the various assets  and actors involved (stakeholders at both the demand and supply-side, depending on the  scope). Analysis of these elements requires solid sectoral knowledge that will need to be  brought into the market analysis effort through sector or domain experts.  To help the analyst undertake the analysis, we have added some reference questions,  which are indicative only; others can be added.  Questions:  • What is the trigger of the cybersecurity market analysis (e.g., a policy action,  investment strategy, market intervention policy, market-supportive measures, a  cyber incident or threat, necessary risk mitigation, observed market trends)?  • Is the goal of your analysis clear, specific, not ambiguous?  • Do you have a method for prioritising market segments?  • Do you need validation for your choice? Who can validate the choice of your  market segment?  34 The criteria referenced in Step 2 and Annex 3 draw on those mentioned in the first version of the ECSMAF.  ENISA CYBERSECURITY MARKET ANALYSIS FRAMEWORK V2.0  Final | Version 2.0 | Public | March 2023  20  STEP 2: SCOPE THE MARKET  SEGMENT FOR ANALYSIS  Once the market analyst, on his or her own or as part of a working group, decides on the  market segment, the next step in the analysis is to set the scope of the analysis using  various criteria. Market analysts, whether at the EUIBAs or national authorities or  associations, will have differing resources and time at their disposition for the conduct of a  cybersecurity market analysis, hence, the level of detail they can analyse will similarly vary.  Moreover, they may find that it is not necessary to follow all of the steps nor undertake all of  the actions described in this framework. In such cases, they should only undertake those  steps, actions and horizontal activities that are relevant and in as much depth as time and  resources allow.  Familiarity with the market segment may also influence the scoping of the analysis. If the  market analyst is somewhat unfamiliar with the chosen market segment, this step may be  better left after Step 3 – Analyse the market segment, in which the market analyst breaks  down the market segment into its core elements. This order may improve the quality of the  analysis scoping exercise. If the market analyst has only a distant familiarity with the chosen  market segment, he or she should look for support from an expert advisory or working group  who can assist with setting the scope of the analysis. In other cases, the market analyst can  proceed directly to scoping the analysis using the prescribed criteria below. Given that Step  1 – Choose the market segment for analysis and Step 2 – Scope the market segment  analysis are non-linear, the market analyst needs to determine their order based on his or  her circumstances.  The aforementioned criteria help respond to market-relevant questions, in particular: What  will the analysis comprise (demand, supply, market penetration of product, services and  processes, market requirements, etc.)?  Step 2 includes the following actions:  • Set the scope  • Group scoping criteria  • Consider a budget for the market analysis.  SET THE SCOPE  Setting the scope includes:  • Balancing the resources available to conduct the analysis. The market analyst  may need to revise his or her initial estimates after performance of Step 3 when  he or she has a better idea of what would be involved in conducting a credible  market analysis. In scoping a particular market segment, the market analyst  should aim to capture all important market issues while taking into account  available resources for the conduct of the analysis.  • Agreeing the depth and breadth of analysis. The market analyst will need to  decide into what depth he or she can go, how far they can “drill” down into a topic.  Similarly, the analyst will need to decide on the “breadth” of the analysis, i.e., he  or she might be able to cover a wider range of cybersecurity markets, but not to  the depth they might like if they were not covering so many topics. Hence, the  market analyst may need to recalibrate his or her initial estimates after Step 3.  ENISA CYBERSECURITY MARKET ANALYSIS FRAMEWORK V2.0  Final | Version 2.0 | Public | March 2023  21  • Understanding the maturity of the market segment to be analysed. Analysis of  cybersecurity markets will most likely involve new and emerging technologies,  some of which will be more mature than others – mature, in the sense that they  have already penetrated their markets, at least to some credible extent.  The market analyst – and stakeholders – can set the depth and breadth of their analysis  using various criteria. The more criteria, the more granular will be their scoping.  Stakeholders, whether internal or external, can contribute to the number and precision of  criteria.35  The market analyst uses the scoping criteria for a specific analysis as the basis for market  research questions for stakeholders. Their responses, together with a literature review,  contribute to the raw material for preparation of the market analysis. The analyst  synthesises their responses into the content of the analysis. The market analyst should  circulate the draft analysis to selected stakeholders for comment before finalising it.  GROUP SCOPING CRITERIA  The scoping criteria can be grouped and subdivided according to various criteria, some of  which will be relevant and others not, it depends on the specific analysis conducted. The  criteria for scoping the analysis can emerge in different ways (from colleagues of the market  analyst, stakeholders, literature review, interviews, focus groups). Below, we present the  various criteria that the market analyst can consider in scoping his or her market segment.  Criteria for the demand side include the following:  • Business impact of procurement of the cybersecurity product, service or process  for the demand side  • Required demand-side capability or maturity for deploying the procured product,  service or process  • Role of the product or service or process in risk mitigation  • Demand-side presence in various geographic locations  • Demand-side requirements to be met by the procured product, service or process  • Identification of gaps in products, services or processes available to meet  demand-side requirements  • Investment plan for financing procurement of the product, service or process  • Assessment of generic company data for the demand side  • Market barriers to procuring the product, service or process.  Criteria for the supply side include the following:  • Business impact of the product, service or process for the supplier  • Capabilities to deploy the product, service or process  • Role of the product, service or process in reducing threats  • Presence in different geographic spaces of the supplier who delivers the product,  service or process  • Assessment of product requirements  • Gaps and emerging requirements  • Supply-side targets  • Supplier financial measures  • Investment plan to finance development of the product, service or process  • Assessment of supply-side company data  35 For example, members of ENISA AHWG on Cybersecurity Market Analysis have contributed to the scoping criteria  in the ENISA Cloud Cybersecurity Market Analysis, https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/cloud-cybersecurity- market-analysis.  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/cloud-cybersecurity-market-analysis https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/cloud-cybersecurity-market-analysis  ENISA CYBERSECURITY MARKET ANALYSIS FRAMEWORK V2.0  Final | Version 2.0 | Public | March 2023  22  • Market barriers.  Criteria for research & development include the following:  • Identification of market niches  • R&D financial figures  • R&D organisational details  • Assessment of relevant contemporary research activities in market area  • Assessment of efficient funding instruments  • Market drivers in related market area  • Market trends and barriers  • Importance of skills  • Innovative research topics in related technology areas.  Criteria for regulation include the following:  • Type, size and areas of influence of the organisation  • Market segments, areas, sectors under regulatory supervision  • Regulatory instruments used  • Cybersecurity threats the exposure to which will be reduced via regulatory activities  • Assessment of transition plans to new regulatory instruments  • Market drivers for regulatory compliance  • Market barriers for regulatory compliance  • Foreseen incentives to support transition by market players.  The various criteria above can be included in a table. The key question for each criterion  has a ‘yes’ or ‘no’ answer, namely: should this criterion be included in the analysis’s scope  or not? Here, as an example, is an extract from a table used in ENISA’s Cloud  Cybersecurity Market Analysis36.  Table 2: Scoping criteria table (sample)  Criteria  group  Criterion Included in  the scope?

Each of the criteria could lead to one or more questions. Step 4 of the  framework covers the use of the scoping criteria to formulate questions in more detail.  Annex 3 includes a detailed list of criteria used in the Cloud Cybersecurity Market  Analysis.37 Most of these criteria are applicable to the scoping of any cybersecurity market  analysis. However, there are also interrelationships and differently structured market  segments that should be considered by the analyst in each individual case.  CONSIDER A BUDGET FOR THE MARKET ANALYSIS  The market analyst should prepare a detailed budget for undertaking the market analysis.  This framework will help the analyst decide which activities he or she should undertake. The  market analyst should, however, call upon the expertise of others in his or her organisation  to have a realistic budget for the analysis. The budget should be as comprehensive as  possible and make provision for human resources, travel, materials, venue hire and catering  for focus groups, workshops, market surveys and other consultative methods. Strategic,  tactical and/or operational factors are likely to drive budget considerations.  At this stage, the market analyst needs to estimate the effort needed for the analysis. By  taking account of the available resources, the market analyst can check the feasibility of the  analysis. If there is a mismatch between the scope and available resources, the sponsors of  the analysis may need to adapt the analysis criteria and/or the available resources.  The analyst should ensure he or she has a budget agreed with their senior managers in  advance of undertaking the analysis. The analyst and his or her finance officer should  review the budget and ongoing costs regularly, at least monthly, to avoid the risk of an over-  run. If such an over-run seems desirable, the analyst should raise the matter as soon as  possible with his or her manager or whoever approved the budget initially.  To help the analyst undertake the analysis, we have added some reference questions, which  are indicative only; others can be added.  Questions:  37 ENISA, Cloud Cybersecurity Market Analysis, https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/cloud-cybersecurity-market- analysis.  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/cloud-cybersecurity-market-analysis https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/cloud-cybersecurity-market-analysis  ENISA CYBERSECURITY MARKET ANALYSIS FRAMEWORK V2.0  Final | Version 2.0 | Public | March 2023  24  • Have you considered the depth and breadth that would be necessary for  meaningful actions by government entities and industry associations?  • How much time do you have to conduct the market analysis?  • How familiar are you with the market segment that your analysis is targeting?  • May your colleagues suggest scoping criteria? May your stakeholders suggest  scoping criteria? May scoping criteria emerge from literature review?  • What findings are you hoping to get from the analysis? May interviews and  focus groups contribute to the scoping criteria?  • Do you know where and how you can get the resources needed to carry out the  analysis?  • What is the trigger for the cybersecurity market analysis (e.g., policy action,  investment strategy, market intervention, market-supportive measures,  incident/threat, risk mitigation, market trends, etc.)?  • What will be included in the analysis (demand, supply, market penetration of  products, services, processes, market requirements, etc.)?  • What are the market research questions that need to be covered by the  analysis?  • What is the content of the value chain and value stack in scope (depth vs.  breadth)?  • What are the main economic criteria for the market scanning (e.g., market size,  demand size, growth, market gaps, etc.)?  • Does the market analysis have a fixed budget?  • Who has to approve the budget for the market analysis?  ENISA CYBERSECURITY MARKET ANALYSIS FRAMEWORK V2.0  Final | Version 2.0 | Public | March 2023  25  STEP 3: ANALYSE THE MARKET  SEGMENT  Once the market analyst has identified the market segment for analysis, he or she has to  analyse it. This step does not strictly have to come after Step 2 – Scope the market  segment for analysis – and if an existing description or analysis of the market segment  exists and is readily available to the market analyst, the duration of this step can be  significantly shortened. Either way, the chosen market segment to be analysed will possess  certain unique traits and elements that distinguish it from other market segments. For  instance, the way in which the cloud market is structured is different from the way in which  the Internet of Things (IoT) is structured and that is different from the way in which the 5G  market is structured (or is being structured).  In addition to the structure (infrastructure, architecture, models, etc.), different market  segments have different assets that require cyber protection, have different threats  and vulnerabilities, and different solutions and controls to protect those assets.  Hence, the analyst may need to consider how a product, service or process is delivered to  customers, i.e., the supply chain, but also how along that path cybersecurity products,  services or processes play a role.  When analysing a market segment, the market analyst should first list its various building  blocks, such as infrastructure components, models and service architecture. In the context  of a cybersecurity market analysis, the role of the presented material is to set the scene for  the various cybersecurity properties, mechanisms, threat models, etc. of important market  segment assets. To identify these assets, the market analyst should list as many elements  as necessary to capture the market segment.  A good approach to this step is to rely on existing standards and expert publications. The  presented structure of a market segment will then be based on an open source analysis of  existing information found in various publications, standards and analyses. Most of the  collected material will reflect the status of the chosen market segment as it emerged in  recent years. The market analyst should thus be aware that existing literature can present a  rather static view of the market segment; hence, he or she should follow recent  developments and adoption of emerging technologies, such as IoT, 5G and AI, but also the  digital transformation imposed by events such as the Covid-19 pandemic.  Some relevant actions in this step are:  • Describe the infrastructure  • Identify assets  • Identify threats  • Identify requirements/challenges  • Identify value stack elements  • Identify market segment stakeholders.  The analyst should ensure he or she has validation, as a horizontal activity going on during  all steps, from relevant stakeholders, who can tell him or her if he or she is going in the right  direction.  One can envisage the value chain literally as a chain where the initial link for a developer  might be the development of the product and the final link might be deployment of the  ENISA CYBERSECURITY MARKET ANALYSIS FRAMEWORK V2.0  Final | Version 2.0 | Public | March 2023  26  product into the marketplace. Each stakeholder in the value chain might also have a value  stack that comprises the elements or components, services or processes that they bring to  the value chain. For example, in the value stack of the developer might be AI developers,  data scientists and technology researchers. Further along in the value chain might be a  system integrator who may have a value stack comprising software, red teams to see if they  can penetrate the software and network operators. Another link in the value chain might  contain a value stack comprising the sales team and lobbyists. See Annex 4 for examples of  value stack elements.  DESCRIBE THE INFRASTRUCTURE  The infrastructure of a market segment will differ from segment to segment. It represents  the unique constellation of physical points, including the software embedded in the  hardware, in which assets can be located. Despite the differences between market  segments, the market analyst can structure the description of the market segment  infrastructure according to the following levels:  • data level (data storage, data in transit, data channels)  • application level (listing all installed applications using the resources of the market  segment, including hardware and software details)  • network level (where are network nodes, supply channels, network security  elements).  Other additional levels may be relevant for specific market segments. The market analysts  can add these accordingly.  When describing the infrastructure, it is important to consider also the attributes of the  market segment. If the infrastructure describes the components of a market segment and  ‘things that exist’ in the market segment, the attributes describe how these elements work  and what they do. The attributes of a market segment also differ between individual  segments, but the market analyst can structure his or her description in the following way:  • essential attributes: how the resources and services are paid for, e.g., on-demand,  pay-as-you-go, resource-pooling, etc., usually used as rationale for pricing  differentiation;  • service models: a list of existing services offered in the market segment,  describing how the infrastructure or its elements are used and what their functions  are;  • deployment models: a list of choices by the stakeholders in the market segment  on the desired model of sharing, access and ownership of the available resources,  e.g., public, private, community, hybrid, etc.  The market analyst should also consider whether companies constitute a specific vertical  industry. The market analyst can assume that in every vertical industry a certain value chain  and value stack characterise the core business. Such knowledge will enhance transparency  and comparability and highlight nuances among stakeholders in the same industry.  Figure 2 below presents an example set of vertical industries. Cybersecurity is a “horizontal”  activity for such industries. They all need cybersecurity. Moreover, the supply chain of  vertical industries may entail cybersecurity as an integrated part of the offering, a built-in  feature of their offerings, but not their main product.  ENISA CYBERSECURITY MARKET ANALYSIS FRAMEWORK V2.0  Final | Version 2.0 | Public | March 2023  27  Figure 2: Vertical industries typically related to cybersecurity products, services and  processes  Originally published in ECSMAF, Version 1.0, the Figure above is just one example of how  vertical industries can be categorised. Another example could be a categorisation inspired by  the NIS Directive38 or by the proposed NIS2 Directive39 that list sectors and subsectors.  IDENTIFY ASSETS  A critical element in threat landscaping is identifying the assets and categories of assets to  which threats can be exposed. Assets are defined as anything that has value to an  individual or organisation, and therefore requires protection.40 Assets in a cybersecurity  market analysis could include infrastructure components (hardware), models, service  architectures, processes and processors, networks, data and software. They may be  physical assets as well as non-tangible assets (e.g., software or other intellectual property).  38 https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/ALL/?uri=CELEX%3A32016L1148  39 https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=COM%3A2020%3A823%3AFIN  40 ENISA, AI Cybersecurity Challenges: Threat Landscape for Artificial Intelligence, p. 22,  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/artificial-intelligence-cybersecurity-challenges.  https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/ALL/?uri=CELEX%3A32016L1148 https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=COM%3A2020%3A823%3AFIN https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/artificial-intelligence-cybersecurity-challenges  ENISA CYBERSECURITY MARKET ANALYSIS FRAMEWORK V2.0  Final | Version 2.0 | Public | March 2023  28  Market analysts should consider how the assets can be attacked and protected, their  robustness and resilience against an attack.  The analyst should also identify gaps in the market, where there is a need or requirement to  be filled or an opportunity to exploit.  IDENTIFY THREATS  Cybersecurity threats to the market segment include ransomware, denial of service attacks,  espionage, phishing and spear phishing, disinformation, extortion, data poisoning and many  more.  Threats come from a variety of state-sponsored and non-state-sponsored attackers, from  criminal gangs to the proverbial teenager in his/her bedroom.  Some threats are more serious than others. Spam is a nuisance, but denial of service can  shut down a service for days, weeks or months. Ransomware can result in total loss of an  organisation’s data and its business. Ransomware attacks against health services have had  huge impacts on individual patients whose records disappear into a black hole.  The market analyst should consider the types of attacks that could occur in the market  segment of interest and how well prepared, how resilient that segment is against attacks. Is  there a relatively high level of awareness of cybersecurity in the segment? Are there  incident response plans in place?  IDENTIFY REQUIREMENTS / CHALLENGES  The market analyst needs to understand the market segment’s requirements and  challenges, some of which are indicated in the following paragraphs.  When identifying requirements and challenges, the market analyst needs to consider all of  the links in the value chain or supply chain, especially where the supplier or buyer depends  on third parties from whom they buy components or to whom they wish to sell their  technology or service.  The market analyst will often ask if there are different ways of delivering or procuring a  technology or service and/or note in his or her analysis the innovations found in market  delivery.  The market analyst must assess the reliability of the supply chain and its compliance with all  relevant legislation and regulatory structures. As the Solar Winds attack in 2020 so well  showed, the analyst should also consider or evaluate the security of the supply chain and all  links in it. The market analysis should also assess the feasibility: depending on the market  segment and the type of survey (e.g., expert interviews with CEOs), such an in-depth study  is difficult to implement.  Several kinds of supply chain attacks have been identified4142, all of which involve creating  or taking advantage of security weaknesses in solutions that companies too often trust.  They include:  • Stolen certificates. If a hacker steals a certificate used to vouch for the legitimacy  or safety of a company’s product, they can peddle malicious code under the guise  of that company’s certificate.  41 ENISA, Threat Landscape for Supply Chain Attacks, https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/threat-landscape-for- supply-chain-attacks.  42 Fortinet, Supply Chain Attacks: Examples and Countermeasures,  https://www.fortinet.com/resources/cyberglossary/supply-chain-attacks.  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/threat-landscape-for-supply-chain-attacks https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/threat-landscape-for-supply-chain-attacks https://www.fortinet.com/resources/cyberglossary/supply-chain-attacks  ENISA CYBERSECURITY MARKET ANALYSIS FRAMEWORK V2.0  Final | Version 2.0 | Public | March 2023  29  • Compromised software development tools or infrastructure. Hackers leverage the  tools for building software applications to introduce security weaknesses in the  development process - even before the process is used to create an application.  • Malware preinstalled on devices. Hackers put malware on phones, USB drives,  cameras and other mobile devices, and when the target connects one of those  devices to their system or network, malicious code is introduced.  • Code included in the firmware of components. Digital hardware is controlled by  firmware that helps it run smoothly and interface with users and other systems.  Hackers can include malicious code in firmware to gain access to a system or  network.  Markets are generally not static, hence, extenuating circumstances can affect the reliability  of the supply chain. Brexit, for example, has affected thousands of companies on both sides  of the English Channel. Another example is the judgement of the European Court of Justice  curtailing the sending of European personal data for processing in the US (the “Schrems II”  judgement43).  Another element that the market analyst should consider when identifying the market and  the challenges are the pricing of the product or service, its unique selling point and the  expected uptake.  Organisations need to price their product, service or process so that they at least break  even or, better still, make a profit. Pricing is partly a matter of deciding how much the costs  of production should be reflected in each unit, how much competitors are charging for  equivalent technologies or services, how many units might be bought or sold over what  period of time. The market segment, technologies and services should have a unique selling  point (USP) – something that distinguishes them from competitors – some feature that the  market finds attractive, if not irresistible. The USP will be a factor in driving the expected  uptake.  The market analyst needs to consider how the technology or service meets a need or  requirement. The analyst should consider the benefit delivered by the technology or service  or market segment versus its affordability. No matter what the vendor’s pricing strategy  might be, if the market cannot afford the service, it will not grow. Hence, the benefit must  outweigh the cost and/or be cost saving. The analyst should factor in the point that costs  may change over time.  Knowing the competition is mostly relevant to individual companies, and this section of the  framework explains why this is important. As mentioned above, the EU Council estimates  that the cybersecurity market in Europe comprises some 60,000 companies44. Hence, there  is a highly textured market, which the analyst needs to understand. The main goals of a  competitor analysis include the following:  • Identify your strongest competitors, including competitors based outside the EU  but operating within the Union;  • Assess your competitors' strategies;  • Anticipate their actions;  • Anticipate their reactions based on the actions of your own business;  43 On 16 July 2020, the European Court of Justice issued the Schrems II judgement with significant implications for  transfer of personal data from the EU to the US. The Court affirmed that data subjects whose personal data are  transferred to a third country must be afforded a level of protection essentially equivalent to that guaranteed within the  European Union. Unless there is a valid European Commission adequacy decision, the competent supervisory  authority is required to suspend or prohibit a transfer of data to a third country. The Court ruled that the so-called EU- US Privacy Shield was invalid.

Hence,  the market analysis needs to take into account the availability of talent. The shortage of  talent has a clear impact on market growth.  An analysis of the chosen market segment must also take into account potential barriers  that could slow down or inhibit the exploitation of the market. We have indicated some  barriers above, e.g., the challenge of recruiting cybersecurity talent. Here is a list of the  most prominent barriers affecting the cybersecurity market.  Financial – Many companies – especially start-ups – are confronted by a liquidity crunch  from time to time. A recent EIB-EC report highlighted the challenges that cybersecurity start-  ups face in obtaining the financing they need to grow. The same report indicates that it is  significantly easier to raise financing in the US compared to the EU.46  Technological – Companies who have developed leading technologies or services are  sometimes in a race against time to get their products or services deployed before another  competitor comes along with a better “mousetrap”.  Regulatory – Regulatory requirements may impact the development and deployment of new  technologies or services, e.g., the GDPR’s requirement to protect personal data or the  proposed AI Act which restricts use of surveillance technologies.  Societal (including cultural and behavioural) – A significant body of public opinion may turn  against the deployment of certain technologies, e.g., facial recognition or storage of DNA.  Geographic – The deployment of some technologies may be foiled by geographic  disparities, e.g., the roll-out of fibre optical cable in rural and remote areas. But what is a  challenge for one technology may be a competitive advantage for another, e.g., satellite  terminals.  Environmental – Some technologies, e.g., blockchain, are not kind to the environment, e.g.,  they consume huge amounts of energy.  Insufficient hype – To grow, markets need promotion. However, customers and clients are  bombarded with information from many sources, hence, promotional materials may not be  enough to make much of a dent in the target market.  Staff shortages – As mentioned above, many cybersecurity companies are constrained by a  shortage of personnel and the need to pay them something approximating the salaries  offered by big foreign competitors.  Asymmetric competition – European start-ups face a formidable challenge in competing with  big, established, non-European companies.  Trust – A lack of trust can be a significant barrier especially in the (prospective) supply  chain.  45 https://www.indeed.com/career-advice/career-development/competitor-analysis  46 European Investment Bank, with contributions from the EC and ECSO, European Cybersecurity Investment  Platform, October 2022, p. 8. https://www.eib.org/attachments/lucalli/20220206-european-cybersecurity-investment- platform-en.pdf.  https://www.indeed.com/career-advice/career-development/competitor-analysis https://www.eib.org/attachments/lucalli/20220206-european-cybersecurity-investment-platform-en.pdf https://www.eib.org/attachments/lucalli/20220206-european-cybersecurity-investment-platform-en.pdf  ENISA CYBERSECURITY MARKET ANALYSIS FRAMEWORK V2.0  Final | Version 2.0 | Public | March 2023  31  Identification of existing barriers against implementing/integrating cybersecurity into systems  may be helpful for the identification of challenges (and opportunities). Such obstacles can  be technical or procedural or knowledge based, or based on missing standards.  The market analyst needs also to consider whether the market segment, technologies or  services under study are exposed to any threats or have vulnerabilities that need to be  addressed. The analyst should consider whether the market segment has any  dependencies, e.g., changes in policies or regulations or collaboration with other  stakeholders in the market.  Threats and vulnerabilities can take many forms. Security controls are measures  undertaken to mitigate the impacts and likelihood of threats to and vulnerabilities in the  assets. Mitigation measures are aimed at avoiding, minimising, eliminating, sharing or  transferring a risk.  Security requirements – the most appropriate way to express demand needs – will be  possible and efficient for analyses focussing on the value chain. Such data, however, are  usually difficult to find, especially if the market analysis scope includes stakeholders who  are reluctant to be as forthcoming as they could be.  IDENTIFY VALUE STACK ELEMENTS  Segmenting the market consists of two main steps: determining the value chain and the  corresponding value stack. The value chain is a term derived from Porter’s Value Chain47.  Investopedia describes the value chain as:  “a series of consecutive steps that go into the creation of a finished product, from its  initial design to its arrival at a customer's door. The chain identifies each step in the  process at which value is added, including the sourcing, manufacturing and marketing  stages of its production.  A company conducts a value-chain analysis by evaluating the detailed procedures  involved in each step of its business. The purpose of a value-chain analysis is to  increase production efficiency so that a company can deliver maximum value for the  least possible cost”.48  Given the technological focus of cybersecurity, we emphasise the primary value chain  elements of operations and services as well as the secondary elements of infrastructure,  technology development and procurement – i.e., the market analyst should account for all of  these elements in his or her analysis.  We can distinguish between a value chain and a supply chain. They may or may not be the  same thing. If the supply chain has some kinks, if certain companies in the supply chain are  less than reliable, it cannot be regarded as a value chain. In a value chain, every link (every  company or organisation) delivers value.  The value stack describes a collection of activities/elements contributing to an  organisation’s value production. These activities may support a product or service in fulfilling  certain standards (e.g., quality, security, compliance, etc.). The value stack follows the  structure of the cybersecurity market value stuck elements and represents a decomposition  of cybersecurity topics and technologies, services and/or processes. An example of typical  cybersecurity value stack elements and their decomposition is shown in Annex 4.  47 Porter, Michael, Competitive Advantage: Creating and Sustaining Superior Performance, Free Press, 1985.  48 https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/valuechain.asp  https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/valuechain.asp  ENISA CYBERSECURITY MARKET ANALYSIS FRAMEWORK V2.0  Final | Version 2.0 | Public | March 2023  32  IDENTIFY MARKET SEGMENT STAKEHOLDERS  Market segment stakeholders come from both the demand side and supply side. Both need  attention from the market analyst. The following paragraphs provide some guidance on  identifying those different actors. The market analyst should consider (a) the number of  people employed in the market segment, especially if the number is graphed over time, e.g.,  from now to five years in the future (such long-term forecasts however might not be easy to  make); (b) the number of companies active in the selected market segment and (c) the  number of stakeholders potentially at risk from malware or other attacks (and the probability  and impact of risk assessment). That number could initially be relatively confined but could  suddenly leap unexpectedly and highly, as happened when Stuxnet escaped into the wild,  when attackers got access to the source code and started using in their own attacks. Many  cyber attacks have hit thousands and millions of computers, especially where the attacker  has promulgated ransomware or uses a botnet in a denial of service attack.  To assess the numbers above, the market analyst should first make a list of key market  segment stakeholders across the supply chain. This list will also serve as a directory of  potential stakeholders the market analyst can target in Step 4 as part of the process of  deciding what to ask stakeholders to have a stronger, more empirical basis for analysing the  market segment.  In this step, as in all steps, the market analyst should seek validation of his or her efforts,  principally by seeking comments on the efforts from stakeholders49. If necessary, the market  analyst may want to return to Step 2 and make some revisions.  The analyst should understand, before he or she starts their work, who will be taking  decisions based on the market analysis. The decision to enter or not a particular market  segment may be taken by one senior manager or it may be a collective decision. The  organisation may have a decision hierarchy. That is, the analyst needs to refer to his or her  manager who will need to refer to a director who will need to refer to a vice president – or  some similar hierarchy of decision-making. Most likely, the market analyst will also seek the  views of key stakeholders, inside as well as outside his or her organisation.  The decision-making process starts with the initiation of the market analysis. There may be  various factors that need to be taken into account before a decision is made. The market  analyst should understand what the decision-making process will be before he or she starts  their work. The organisation undertaking the market analysis may want to circulate the draft  analysis to others to have their views before taking a decision. On the other hand, the  organisation may not want to share the market analysis with anyone outside a tight circle of  top managers for reasons of commercial sensitivity.  To help the analyst undertake the analysis, we have added some reference questions,  which are indicative only; others can be added.  Questions:  • How have you characterised the market segment? Have you done so in a  way that the non-specialist can easily grasp?  • Have you identified clearly the assets of relevance to your analysis?  • Can you specify the needs and requirements of the target market?  • What threats or factors could disrupt the market segment you are analysing?  • What security controls are or can be put in place to address perceived  threats?  • Who are the competitors in the market segment?  49 In the instance of ENISA analyses, for instance, the Agency consults widely with stakeholders (including ENISA  management and ENISA bodies), not only on the finalised market analyses, but also components thereof, such as the  scoping criteria. ENISA not only consults, but also validates its analyses with stakeholders.  ENISA CYBERSECURITY MARKET ANALYSIS FRAMEWORK V2.0  Final | Version 2.0 | Public | March 2023  33  • Where are the points of competition, e.g., a specific technology or service?  • How do competitors' value propositions differ from yours?  • How effective are their marketing campaigns and the 4 Ps: their product,  pricing, promotion and place (where they are selling)?  • Do you know who the competitors are now or might be in the coming months  or years?  • Have you delineated the barriers to enter the market?  • What is the environmental impact of the selected market segment?  • Have you described the components of the value stack and value chain of  relevance to your market analysis and any weaknesses or vulnerabilities in  either?  • Do you know who will take the ultimate decision to enter the cybersecurity  market?  • Do you know what factors the decision-maker(s) will want to know?  • Does the decision-maker have any questions beyond the details in the  market analysis to help him or her make a decision?  • Has the decision-maker had any interactions with market stakeholders who  have an (undue) influence on the decision-maker’s conclusions? For  example, well-funded big technology companies may have many times more  meetings with policymakers than civil society organisations.  • Will the public be informed about the decision-making process?  • How will the decision be announced?  • Who will make the announcement?  • When will the announcement be made?  • Are there any legal obligations with regard to the decision-making process?  • Have the criteria for making a decision been made public or, if not, does the  market analyst know those criteria?  ENISA CYBERSECURITY MARKET ANALYSIS FRAMEWORK V2.0  Final | Version 2.0 | Public | March 2023  34  STEP 4: DECIDE WHAT TO ASK  STAKEHOLDERS  Two relevant actions related to this step are:  • Identify participating market stakeholder types  • Decide on questions to ask stakeholders.  IDENTIFY PARTICIPATING MARKET STAKEHOLDER TYPES  Those interested in cybersecurity products, services and processes come from a wide  range of different stakeholder groups that can be categorised in various ways and at various  levels of granularity. At high level, the principal stakeholder groups include government,  agencies, regulators, industry, law enforcement authorities, academics, the media, civil  society organisations. Each of these categories can be examined in greater granularity. So,  for example: industry can be further subdivided into banking and finance, communications,  media and services, insurance, manufacturing and natural resources, retail, transportation,  utilities, wholesale trade, technology, etc. The cybersecurity industry comprises a wide  range of developers, integrators, service providers and trade associations among others.  Governments can be subdivided into education, healthcare, aviation, maritime, border  security, critical infrastructure protection, counter-terror intelligence, etc. Governments  include a wide range of policymakers, regulators, national authorities with cybersecurity  responsibilities, computer security incident response teams (CSIRTs) as well as relevant  experts within European institutions, bodies and agencies and their partners. Companies  can be profiled by their turnover (revenues), profitability, number of employees, ownership,  sector and location. Even internal stakeholders can be grouped, e.g., based on the structure  of the organisation.  The market analyst will have some different questions for suppliers, vendors, researchers,  developers and regulators – i.e., the questions developed for one segment may be different  from those of another segment. Some questions may be the same, but others will be  different. Different stakeholders will bring different perspectives to bear, thus, enriching the  market analysis.  Identification of market stakeholder types includes types of market stakeholder dynamics  (i.e., innovation power, quick rates, niche-product development, research-oriented, etc.).  Some examples of stakeholder types include:  • Institutional stakeholders and other stakeholders who can influence the market;  • Consumers (demand side), including procurement officials, institutions and  companies seeking cybersecurity controls against the attacks they face every day;  • Suppliers (supply side) often, but not always, companies who seek to sell their  cybersecurity products, services and processes to third parties inside and outside  the EU;  • Stakeholders who can grow the market;  • Internal stakeholders.  Institutional stakeholders and other stakeholders who can influence the  market  These stakeholders are entitled to propose ideas for priorities for the performance of  cybersecurity market analyses. They might be institutional stakeholders e.g., Member  ENISA CYBERSECURITY MARKET ANALYSIS FRAMEWORK V2.0  Final | Version 2.0 | Public | March 2023  35  States, the European Commission and other EU institutions, bodies and agencies  (EUIBAs), industrial associations and stakeholder groups.  Policymakers and regulators, for instance, can influence the cybersecurity markets by the  legislation they adopt and implement. Legislation and regulation can curtail a market, but  they can also give impetus to a market. They can force non-EU actors to comply with the  same rules as European entities. But the latter may gain at least a temporary advantage if  they already understand and comply with European legislation, such as the GDPR.  Standards bodies, such as the ISO, CEN, CENELEC, ETSI and IEEE, can influence  markets by setting standards for new technologies. For example, ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 27  addresses information security, cybersecurity and privacy protection. ISO SC 42 addresses  artificial intelligence. The market analyst might wish to join national mirror committees that  track particular ISO or CEN committees.  Consumers (demand side)  Consumers are those who might buy the product or service, who procure, or who buy a  cybersecurity solution. They create the demand. Demand volume and growth can be  analysed starting from basic financial data – how many units have been sold in the past  year and what are the expectations for the next year (and thereafter). However, depending  on the detail of the analysis (e.g., value stack), such data might be difficult to find and  collect. Hence, corresponding data sources will need to be used.  Suppliers (supply side)  Suppliers are those who can supply a cybersecurity product, service or process. This type  includes, among others, service providers, enablers, equipment providers, integrators,  vendors such as multi-domain industrial asset vendors, multi-domain vendors, single-  domain specialised vendors, single-domain specialised vendors (for more details on  vendors, see Annex 5).  The market analyst should consider the value-chain elements describing the technologies,  services and processes for each supplier type. The level of detail for the value chain will  depend on the focus of the market analysis and value stack. The analyst should map  suppliers’ role in the value chain and value stack and, having done so, create a market  guide or landscaping report, providing an overview of the principal vendors; a map defining  the market from a supply-side perspective and, as comprehensively as possible, the value  chain and value stack and vendor revenues per market segment; vendor profiles rating  them according to different methodologies, e.g., company overview and SWOT profiling;  market share, size and forecast.  Stakeholders who can grow the market  Researchers can help to grow the market segment with their work, which will contribute to  the development of new cybersecurity technologies, assessing the impact of future  technology and innovation on the relevant market segment. The analyst might wish to track  new patents and the state of the art referenced in journal articles and EU-funded projects.  Developers are instrumental in developing new technologies, services and processes.  Their innovations may have an electrifying impact on a market segment. Developers may  participate in research projects from universities, industry and governmental entities.  Investors can provide the liquidity that, especially, small companies need from time to time  to get their innovations to the market. Investors can be venture capitalists, venture angels,  banks and other lending institutions.  ENISA CYBERSECURITY MARKET ANALYSIS FRAMEWORK V2.0  Final | Version 2.0 | Public | March 2023  36  Entrepreneurs play a key role in the economy, using their skills and initiative to anticipate  needs and bring good new ideas to market. An entrepreneur is an individual who creates a  new business, bearing most of the risks and enjoying most of the rewards. The  entrepreneur is an innovator, a source of new ideas, products, services and processes.50  Internal stakeholders  Internal stakeholders come from different divisions within an organisation, e.g., senior  management team, the legal department, operations, research, finance department. Internal  stakeholders may include working groups, comprising representatives from relevant  stakeholder groups51.  DECIDE ON QUESTIONS TO ASK STAKEHOLDERS  Once the market analyst identifies the relevant stakeholder types for the chosen market  segment, he or she can prepare customised questions to ask those stakeholders52. The  analyst should be clear about what data he or she wants to gather from the stakeholders.  The analyst should consider the types of questions, e.g., avoiding open-ended question  and, instead, relying on Yes/No questions, multiple choice questions or Likert (rating) scale  questions, i.e., to make the questions easy and quick to answer. The analyst should rank  the questions in importance. The fewer the number of questions, the more responses the  analyst is likely to get. The analyst should initiate his or her questions of stakeholders by  explaining the purpose of the questions and how their responses will be used.  To develop questions to ask stakeholders, the market analyst can refer to the table with  scoping criteria (see Annex 3). For every criterion included in the scope (answered with  “yes”), the market analyst can phrase a matching question. To use the example from the  sample table in Step 2 above (see Table 2), if the scoping table criterion for the demand  side about “Required demand-side capability/maturity” was marked with “Yes”, the analysis  will focus on the capability level of the demand-side to deploy and/or manage the procured  product, service or process. The market analyst can then refer to the sub-criteria in the  table:  • Capability available: demand-side possesses necessary capabilities already;  • Capability to be developed: necessary capability is not available at demand side,  but will be developed;  • Capability outsourcing: demand side plans to outsource the capabilities needed to  deploy/maintain the product, service or process.  In our example, all three sub-criteria were marked with “yes”, so the market analyst can  phrase three questions that will produce data that covers those sub-criteria chosen for the  scope of the study. The respective questions could be the following:  • Does the demand side possess the necessary capability to deploy a given  procured product, service or process (in the chosen market segment)?  • Can the demand side develop the necessary capability to deploy a given procured  product, service or process?  • Can the demand side outsource the capability to deploy a given product, service  or process?  The first two of the three questions are dependent on the previous answers being answered  with “no”. In developing the set of questions, therefore, the market analyst must keep in  50 Adapted from https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/entrepreneur.asp.  51 For ENISA, for instance, the ENISA Management Team, the ENISA Advisory Group (AG), the ENISA Management  Team and its Ad Hoc Working Group on EU Cybersecurity Market  (https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/standards/adhoc_wg_calls/ad-hoc-working-group-on-cybersecurity-market)  52 Annex 6 contains example questions for stakeholders.  https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/entrepreneur.asp https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/standards/adhoc_wg_calls/ad-hoc-working-group-on-cybersecurity-market  ENISA CYBERSECURITY MARKET ANALYSIS FRAMEWORK V2.0  Final | Version 2.0 | Public | March 2023  37  mind the hierarchy, dependencies and order of questions, especially if created in digital  format.  When preparing the questions, the market analyst should also refer to the elements and  description of the market segment. Some resources or service models may not be present  in the scoping table, but may warrant additional investigation. The description may not be  complete or information on emerging technologies may be unavailable to the market  analyst. In these scenarios, he or she should incorporate questions not covered by the  scoping table. The scoping table is a general list of criteria that aims to set general  guidelines for cybersecurity market analyses across all market segments, but specific  market segments may require expanding the scope of the questions.  The questions are then used as the basis to collect the data. A survey can be developed  based on the questions, but other data collection tools may also be considered, including  using automated means for instance to collect (additional) data. For data collection  methods, see Step 5 below on Collect the data.  The market analyst needs to project his or her estimate of the market segment’s  deployment readiness. The analyst can assess the results from various open source  research activities (e.g., European projects, national and international research  actions/projects) in terms of their readiness and maturity levels. In doing so, he or she can  identify gaps and opportunities that might influence innovation and adoption in the market  segment. This task is highly prioritised within the EU (e.g., by the European Cybersecurity  Competence Centre, European Innovation Council, ENISA and the latter’s Research and  Innovation Team), for its actions in strengthening European research and innovation.  To help the analyst undertake the analysis, we have added some reference questions,  which are indicative only; others can be added.  Questions:  • Which stakeholder types do you plan to consult for their views on analysing  the market segment of interest?  • Have you included among the stakeholders representatives from  government, agencies, regulators, industry, law enforcement authorities,  academics, the media, civil society organisations?  • Have you included developers, integrators, service providers and/or trade  associations among others?  • Have you included among the stakeholders to consult those internal to your  organisation, e.g., those responsible for service development and offerings,  legal staff, marketing and communications experts, operations, senior  management, etc.?  • Have you planned to consult with an adequate number of stakeholders  o from the demand side?  o from the supply side?  o who can grow the market, such as researchers, developers and  investors?  • Have you thought carefully about the questions to be addressed to the  different stakeholder types to ensure their relevance? (Some questions  will be relevant for all stakeholders, others will be relevant for specific  stakeholder types, but not others.)  ENISA CYBERSECURITY MARKET ANALYSIS FRAMEWORK V2.0  Final | Version 2.0 | Public | March 2023  38  STEP 5: COLLECT THE DATA  Market analysts can gather the data they need for their analyses by a variety of means and  from a variety of sources. Surveys, interviews and focus groups are examples of primary (or  empirical) research. A literature review is an example of secondary research. Both  methods should consider the ethics and data protection aspects of data collection and  processing.  Some relevant actions related to this step are:  • Conduct primary research  • Conduct secondary research  • Take into account ethics and data protection.  CONDUCT PRIMARY RESEARCH  Primary research consists of the collection of data directly from stakeholders targeted by the  market analysis effort (i.e., relevant market stakeholder types from the relevant vertical  industry). Primary research is usually implemented through surveys, focus groups and  interviews (online, by phone or mail). If the market analyst is conducting primary research, he  or she will need to decide which tools to use. He or she will need to develop a questionnaire,  conduct the survey and analyse the results. The different tools for primary research have  some pros and cons. The tools are not mutually exclusive; in fact, they are complementary.  Surveys  If the market analyst decides to conduct a survey, he or she must be clear whom they wish  to target. Is it the public or a particular demographic or geographic area? The analyst must  decide if they can be conducted via telephone or online. The latter are significantly less  expensive. Survey questions should be tested ex ante. Surveys require a certain number of  participants for statistically meaningful results. Random surveys, e.g., responses to questions  on a website, cannot be regarded as representative. If surveys are conducted across different  Member States and translation of the questions are made, the analyst must ensure that  translations of questions agree with the source questions. Larger surveys might be  subcontracted to specialised survey agencies, holding established pools of respondents.  Interviews  The market analyst can conduct interviews in person or by phone (or communication  platforms). The advantage of interviews is that the market analyst can pick to whom he or she  chooses to talk. It also has the advantage of direct involvement in the collection, the possibility  to steer the discussion with interviewees and the ownership of the collected data. The  disadvantage is the amount of time and cost involved to conduct them, especially if they  require some travel. The market analyst should conduct at least some interviews with key  stakeholders, if for no other reason than as a reality check against data gathered from other  sources.  Focus groups  The market analyst can explore a cybersecurity market with the help of one or more focus  groups. A focus group usually comprises about 10 experts, preferably from diverse entities,  who have expert knowledge of the topic or issue at hand. A cybersecurity focus group might  bring together representatives from different stakeholder types, for instance, a cybersecurity  ENISA CYBERSECURITY MARKET ANALYSIS FRAMEWORK V2.0  Final | Version 2.0 | Public | March 2023  39  developer, a procurement department, a cybersecurity company, a public prosecutor’s office,  an academic, a civil society organisation, an enabler, such as a legal expert – or some  combination thereof. Usually, the group focuses on a limited number of questions for  discussion, lasts less than a day, tries to reach a consensus and makes some  recommendations in response to the question(s) discussed. Focus groups are good for  primary research, but are time-consuming to organise and may require payments to the  participants. A focus group requires an animator and someone to take notes. Focus groups  may be a useful complement to other data-gathering strategies. For example, focus groups  can be used to test how questions in surveys are understood. They can also be used to  discuss the results of surveys and/or interviews.  Observation  The market analyst might wish to see how consumers or other stakeholders react in particular  situations or where they are subject to the same stimuli. Market analysts have to be careful  with respect to the methodology - introducing stimuli and any elements of deception (e.g.,  untrue information) would carry a specific set of ethics and data protection concerns. Passive  observation could be the way to go, e.g., stakeholders' publicly known reactions to existing,  publicly known stimuli. Such observation could be online or in person (e.g., how data subjects  react to deepfakes). For cybersecurity research, such observation would most likely need to  be online. If the analyst is gathering personal data, he or she will need the data subject (the  person)’s consent for the observation.  CONDUCT SECONDARY RESEARCH  Secondary research is based on already existing data, including open source intelligence  (OSINT). It is usually sufficient to provide a good generic overview on market issues related  to a specific domain. It should be the principal choice in the starting phases of market  research efforts, for example, during the scoping of an analysis. The advantage of this  method is its low costs, its efficiency and ownership of collected data. A disadvantage is that  the publicly available information might be limited or inaccurate or arcane or not specific  enough regarding the vendor’s product, service or process or the buyer’s interest in knowing  who sells the products, services or processes that would fulfil their needs and requirements.  In the instance of secondary research, the market analyst will need to identify various data  sources, such as news stories, journal articles, scientific studies, “grey literature”, such as  government reports, research deliverables (e.g., from EU-funded Horizon Europe projects).  The analysts will need to extract the salient data points from his or her secondary research  and, in due course, validate his or her research outputs (the market analysis) by means of  colleagues, peers and/or stakeholders.  Online communities  Social media may offer a useful market research tool to get immediate feedback on  customers’ experiences and beliefs and to ask consumers about potential product  improvements. If your social accounts do not have hundreds of thousands (if not millions) of  followers, do not expect social media to be a viable source of market research.53 The  reliability or validity of data from social media is questionable for various reasons. Social  media users are not representative of the public as a whole. Online communities may be  subject to manipulation and disinformation.  The market analyst can research social media in several ways:  53 Beaulac, Hugh, How to Use Social Media for Market Research, CXL, 18 Feb 2019, updated 12 Mar 2021.  https://cxl.com/blog/social-media-market-research/  https://cxl.com/blog/social-media-market-research/  ENISA CYBERSECURITY MARKET ANALYSIS FRAMEWORK V2.0  Final | Version 2.0 | Public | March 2023  40  • Qualitative content analysis (number of likes/comments/shares). The number of  Likes can be a vanity metric, but assessing the engagement rate of consumers on  social media may suggest the attractiveness of a marketing message or product.  • Social listening. Passively gather feedback from your customers or monitor  opinions about your brand or competitors.  • Polls or questions. Ask questions directly in social media feeds, encouraging  users to share thoughts and feelings.54  The market analyst should consider which social media will yield the most useful results. As  one example, around 97% of B2B and B2C companies use one of the largest online  platforms. 55  Use of automated means  The use of automated means to collect and process information can be considered,  including web-crawlers and Machine Learning (ML)/Artificial Intelligence (AI) based text  analysis. For instance, ML can be used for pre-filtering large amount of web-based  information that is then reviewed by the analyst. When automatic means are used,  important related propaedeutic actions include the definition of the areas to search (e.g.  common information channels/blogs/newsfeed) and the identification of the key words to  use for the search.  Contracted market research  Research can be contracted to external market analysis companies. They provide “turnkey”  market analyses in response to market research questions. Though this method leverages  existing skills and data collection infrastructure, the market analyst or her team need to  precisely formulate the research questions and ensure that the analysis will produce the  desired results in the desired manner (i.e., report types). This can be achieved by  performing a scoping exercise, as described above. The downside of contracted research is  cost. The upside is that the cost of contracted research is sometimes shared by several  clients.  TAKE INTO ACCOUNT ETHICS AND DATA PROTECTION  When planning and executing data collection activities, the market analyst should take into  account the ethical and data protection requirements of each method of data collection.  Ethical issues include such things as respect for persons and for human dignity; fair  distribution of benefits and burden; the rights and interests of the participants; transparency  with regard to the purpose and methods of the activity; the need to ensure participants' free  informed consent (with particular attention to vulnerable categories of individuals such as  children, patients, discriminated people, minorities, persons unable to give consent, etc.),  avoidance of bias. Moreover, the methodologies used in the cybersecurity market analysis  should not result in discriminatory practices or unfair treatment. When conducting  interviews, the analyst may wish to ask the interviewee to review a written information sheet  and to sign an informed consent form (i.e., that the interviewee understands the purpose of  the interview and consents to be interviewed).  Among data protection issues with which the analyst may need to contend are the  following: the legal basis for processing; compliance with data processing principles;  pseudonymisation and where feasible, anonymisation; enabling data subject rights, e.g.,  some experts might wish for anonymity, while others are okay with attribution; repurposing  of personal data; the transfer of exports of EU data to non-EU countries; national rules on  54 Ibid.  55 Ibid.  ENISA CYBERSECURITY MARKET ANALYSIS FRAMEWORK V2.0  Final | Version 2.0 | Public | March 2023  41  cold-calling, e.g., when conducting online surveys, etc. These are just a few examples. The  GDPR is a key reference.  To help the analyst undertake the analysis, we have added some reference questions,  which are indicative only; others can be added.  Questions:  • How are you planning to collect data? Are you conducting interviews, surveys,  focus groups, etc.?  • Are you conducting a credible review of journal articles, government reports,  third-party analyses, social media, etc., for findings of relevance to the market  analysis?  • Do you expect to collect sufficient data to make a credible market analysis?  • Do you expect to be able to cite in the market analysis a credible list of sources  for your analysis?  • Are you in compliance with the relevant ethical and data protection  frameworks?  ENISA CYBERSECURITY MARKET ANALYSIS FRAMEWORK V2.0  Final | Version 2.0 | Public | March 2023  42  STEP 6: ANALYSE THE DATA  This step consists of extracting relevant and valuable information from the data collected.  The main actions in this step are:  • Process the data collected  • Identify interesting findings  • Examine contextual factors  • Identify trends  • Assess the sustainability, innovation and evolution of the market  • Compare views.  PROCESS THE DATA COLLECTED  The market analyst will need to process the data collected from various sources and in  various forms. For example, interview data will be in the form of notes or transcripts. The  output of focus groups and workshops will be reports agreed by the participants. Computers  may tabulate some or all of survey data, especially from online surveys, but some telephone  surveys may result in responses to a combination of multiple choice type questions as well  as unstructured subjective views. In other words, the market analyst may draw on  qualitative and quantitative data and need to process it to generate his or her key findings  but also to document the evidence for those key findings. The analyst will need to structure  and “clean” the data to fix or remove incorrect, corrupted, incorrectly formatted, duplicate or  incomplete data within a dataset. When combining multiple data sources, there are many  opportunities for data to be duplicated or mislabelled. If data is incorrect, outcomes and  algorithms are unreliable, even though they may look correct. The market analyst may  benefit from a template for the data cleaning process so so that he or she know they are  doing it the right way every time.56  Despite best efforts at collecting data from a variety of sources, the market analyst may still  find some holes or gaps in the data collected and in the resulting analysis. The analyst can  (perhaps) bridge the gap by making some informed assumptions or collect views of a group  of experts, e.g., in a focus group aimed at making some assumptions based on scarce  evidence.  Processing the data collected inevitably means summarising and synthesising the data so  that it is coherent and “tells a story”. For example, incident response reports should describe  how an attacker penetrated the target, the vulnerability exploited by the attacker, the  consequences and impact of the attack, the remedial measures taken or that should be  taken, who is responsible for what, etc. So: a story. Or, as another example, the market  analyst may want to know how big the potential market is for some new software for  detecting attacks somewhere in the supply chain. Hence, the analyst will need to posit the  market need and demand for such software that might open up a new, as yet non-existent  market. The market analyst may need to conduct interviews and host focus groups to get a  feel for the likely demand for the software. The analyst’s market analysis report will need to  say what data was collected, how and when it was collected, and the findings. To make the  case for developing a new market, the analyst will need tell a story, underpinned by  evidence, and when there is a lacuna in the evidence, to say what assumption led to the  conclusions.  Processing data takes time, especially if there is a serious need for cleaning. The analyst  needs to be well aware of the time and complexity of data processing. He or she should be  56 https://www.tableau.com/learn/articles/what-is-data-cleaning  https://www.tableau.com/learn/articles/what-is-data-cleaning  ENISA CYBERSECURITY MARKET ANALYSIS FRAMEWORK V2.0  Final | Version 2.0 | Public | March 2023  43  guided by five characteristics of data quality, namely: the validity, accuracy, completeness,  consistency and uniformity of the data, i.e., the degree to which the data is specified using  the same unit of measure. 57  The analyst may also consider using for the data collection some automated means such as  web-crawlers and ML/AI based text analysis, which might be useful for instance for pre-  filtering information or for identifying trend detection.  IDENTIFY INTERESTING FINDINGS  In conducting the analysis, the analyst needs to keep in mind to whom he or she is going to  send the analysis and what their expectations of the analysis might be.  The analyst should analyse the data and identify any interesting points or priorities, for  instance:  • Gaps between demand and supply  • Incentives driving market entry  • Attractiveness of market entry  • Regulatory and policy compliance  • Contextual factors  • Trends (see section on Identify Trends)  Gaps between demand and supply  Gaps between supply and demand may create opportunities, depending on which side of  the fence the market analyst stands. If demand outstrips supply for a new product, service  or process, the vendor can price his or her offering higher than in a competitive market with  alternatives. Conversely, if supply outstrips demand, the vendor may find he or she needs to  lower the price of their offering, perhaps to uneconomic levels.  The market analyst needs to consider where and why there are gaps in the market. Gaps  could appear anywhere in the supply chain. The market analyst needs to be aware that his  or her forecast could be completely undone by a failure or weakness in the supply chain,  including some stakeholder in the chain who decides to increase significantly the price of  their offering. For example, a shortage of chips may be caused by the collateral damage of  war or simply bad planning or a shortage of a precious mineral such as palladium,  manganese, cobalt or lithium used in smart phones. The analyst should contemplate how  the gap could be filled and the likely impact of the gap on the growth in the market segment.  Gaps between supply and demand may arise from the fact that a vendor may need a steady  supply of a component but may want to minimise how many such components it must carry  in its inventory versus not being able to meet the demand. In the cybersecurity sector, gaps  in supply and demand may also arise because of a shortage of talent. Thus, the analyst  should also consider the labour demands in the market segment of interest.  Incentives driving market entry  Developers and vendors of new and emerging technologies and services are driven to the  marketplace by various incentives, among which are these:  • Profit – Almost always the principal incentive;  • Transferability – Technologies developed in a government or university research  lab can be spun out to the private sector. The research for one application may be  transferred to one or more other applications;  57 Ibid.  ENISA CYBERSECURITY MARKET ANALYSIS FRAMEWORK V2.0  Final | Version 2.0 | Public | March 2023  44  • Adaptability – The technology results can be adapted across different  applications;  • Reputation – Stakeholders invest in an interesting market segment to enhance  their reputation, even if a profit is not likely in the near term;  • Caution – Many experts are concerned about the impact of quantum computing  on cybersecurity, hence, many entities – governments, universities, tech  companies – are conducting research even though the pay-off may be a decade  or more away;  • Shared interests – Stakeholders may be motivated by shared interests, like those  needed to build a 5G network or those needed to agree extended reality  standards.  The market analyst needs to specify what are the principal drivers for cybersecurity  research, innovation and exploitation in the market segment of his or her analysis. We  expect certification to be a major driver in the marketplace. For example, much of the  Cybersecurity Act is devoted to cybersecurity certification. Cybersecurity certification may  play a more important role in some domains than others.  Attractiveness of market entry  The market analyst needs to consider the costs, revenues and profits expected from the  market segment over time. The market analyst should cite the evidence for his or her  estimates and how confident he or she is in those estimates.  Regulatory and policy compliance  The market analysis should provide some contextual information on the legislative and  regulatory environment. The market analyst should alert his or her readers to the status of  prospective legislation that could have an impact on the cybersecurity market such as the  proposed AI Act or Cyber Resilience Act.  These pressures on the supply side will include compliance with the legislation such as the  EU’s General Data Protection Regulation, the Cyber Security Act, the Digital Services Act,  the Digital Markets Act, the NIS 2 directive and the e-Privacy regulation.  On the demand-side, the buyers of cybersecurity products, services or processes also face  regulatory or policy pressures, e.g., in adequately securing their network or complying with  standards.  EXAMINE CONTEXTUAL FACTORS  The market analyst should take contextual factors into account in his or her analysis. There  are two classic methodologies for identifying and analysing contextual factors. First is the  SWOT analysis focusing on the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats. Second  is the PESTLE methodology to analyse the impact of contextual factors that may be  political, economic, social, technology, legal or environmental (PESTLE) (more information  on PESTLE factors is provided below).  SWOT analysis  A SWOT analysis – which focuses on the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats  – is a widely used methodology in governmental and non-governmental institutions,  associations and the private sector. Among other things, it serves policy objectives – e.g.,  how strong is the EU in a particular market segment, where does it have opportunities to  extend its sovereignty and autonomy – as well as competitor analysis – e.g., what threats  does the EU face, where is it vulnerable. It is also a useful methodology for scoping a  market analysis, especially when it used in question mode. Below are examples of SWOT-  ENISA CYBERSECURITY MARKET ANALYSIS FRAMEWORK V2.0  Final | Version 2.0 | Public | March 2023  45  based questions for market analysis conducted by an EUIBA, an international organisation  or a European association.  Strengths  • What are the EU’s strengths in the selected market segment?  • Are there some national or EU champions in the selected market?  • How is our technology or service better than that of our competitor?  • What are the prospects for further developing our strengths in the selected  market?  Weaknesses  • What weaknesses do we (does the EU) have in the market segment?  • Does the EU / do we have some strategic vulnerabilities, i.e., our weakness in the  selected market segment has some knock-on effects in other markets?  • Will our weakness increase our dependency on non-European third parties?  Opportunities  • Do “we” see some opportunities for Europe / for our institution in developing and  deploying a new technology or service or process in the cybersecurity market?  • How is it an opportunity? Is it a gap in the marketplace worth exploring?  • Does the opportunity require some support from the EU or national governments?  • Does the opportunity come with any conditions?  • Is the opportunity one about which we can talk openly or does it require  confidentiality until the product or service is deployed?  Threats  • Does Europe / our institution face a threat in our chosen market segment? How  serious is it?  • What is the nature of the threat? Is it technological, financial, economic or other?  • Is there a perceived gap in the market that could be subject to an attack? Or is  there a gap that could be addressed with a new cybersecurity product or service?  • What is the origin of the threat?  • What can we do to mitigate the threat?  • What might happen if we don’t respond to the threat?  PESTLE factors  Market analysts typically consider multiple perspectives to gain an overview of key trends.  One of the most frequently applied measurement tools to analyse how external factors  (Political, Economic, Social, Technology, Legal, Environmental)58 affect the operations of an  organisation or a specific market segment is abbreviated PESTLE. These factors help  public and private organisations understand potential impacts, take better decisions,  allocate resources more efficiently and introduce changes to generate improvements in  impacted areas. They also help identify current and future opportunities and risks and how  to best manage them.  A PESTLE analysis typically includes the following steps:  • Identifying the key events within the six external factors;  58 Variants that build on the PEST framework include PESTLE, which puts more emphasis on the legal and  environmental factors.  ENISA CYBERSECURITY MARKET ANALYSIS FRAMEWORK V2.0  Final | Version 2.0 | Public | March 2023  46  • Analysing possible impacts on the organisation or market segment;  • Categorising opportunities and threats; and  • Tracking trends.  On this basis, organisations can develop corrective or pre-emptive strategic actions.  The political factor of the PESTLE methodology aims to assess how new government  policies and changes in legislation affect a specific market segment or an organisation’s  operations. Typical examples are tax, employment, environmental and other laws (see also  legal factors below). The political factor encompasses aspects such as the general political  climate of a country, the degree of government stability, its regulations, international  relations and posture. Terrorist attacks usually prompt demands for more surveillance and  politicians may accede to such demands even though they may know that increased  surveillance does not automatically lead to a reduction in cybercrime. An example is the  current geopolitical crisis.  The economic factor assesses the key determinants of an economy’s performance such as  inflation rates, exchange rates, cost of production, economic growth, disposable income of  consumers and the unemployment rate. These determinants may have a direct or indirect  impact on organisations and market segments, for example, a trend in a certain direction  may affect the purchasing power of consumers and could change the demand/supply  models in the economy. The economic factor can impact the way organisations price their  products, services or processes. An example of an economic or financial contextual factor is  the increasing cost of cybercrime and cyber attacks, with far-reaching costs, such as those  caused by the WannaCry ransomware in 2017 or the shutdown of the Colonial Pipeline  network in the eastern US in 2021 following a ransomware attack against the computerised  equipment managing the pipeline.  The social factor refers to the demographic characteristics, cultural attitudes and customs of  the target populations. Typically, this includes for instance the population growth rate, age  distribution, income distribution, cultural barriers and emerging lifestyle attitudes and  consciousness (e.g., environmental, privacy and health) affecting consumers’ behaviours  and preferences. An example of a social contextual factor affecting the cybersecurity market  is the public’s reaction against facial recognition in public spaces.  The technology factor pertains to innovations in technology that may affect the operations of  organisations and a specific market segment. This factor refers to technology advancement  and maturity, the emergence of disruptive technologies, the level of innovation, automation,  research and development (R&D) activity, technological change and the amount of  technological awareness that a market possesses. These factors may influence decisions to  adopt new technologies, enter or not other sectors, launch or not other products or  outsource production activities. Artificial intelligence is an example of a technology that has  had a transformative impact on the cybersecurity market. Defenders employ AI in anomaly  detection to guard against all kinds of attacks, while attackers have begun to employ AI in  viruses (Stuxnet is a classic example and one of the first of an AI-driven virus). AI is helping  defenders to speed up reaction times, when time is of the essence when the organisation is  experiencing an attack.  The legal factor concerns an organisation’s compliance with relevant laws that could affect  its position in the market. For instance, in the context of cybersecurity market analysis, the  market analyst should endeavour to analyse how changes in the data protection legislation  may impact the demand and the supply of certain products, services or processes.  The environmental factor concerns the impact on the environment of a cybersecurity  product, service or process. Often environmental factors have been overlooked. For  example, blockchain technology might be good at the confidentiality and privacy of  transactions, but it burns huge amounts of energy. Many of our infrastructures have  ENISA CYBERSECURITY MARKET ANALYSIS FRAMEWORK V2.0  Final | Version 2.0 | Public | March 2023  47  environmental impacts, such as water delivery systems and energy networks. Such  infrastructures are constantly combatting attacks with as strong cybersecurity as they can  manage. Successful cyberattacks against infrastructure may cause huge environmental  damage, e.g., disruption to water networks, oil spills or black-outs. To counter attacks,  defenders need to understand the vulnerabilities in environmental and infrastructure  networks.  IDENTIFY TRENDS  Cutting across contextual factors or even animating them are cybersecurity market trends.  They are one of the main elements to understand and estimate market developments.  Market trends emerge from a variety of factors. They may be of a generic nature or sector  specific. The relevance of market trends for a specific analysis requires a multi-level  assessment to cover these dimensions.  Market analysts can foresee trends in technology research, but environmental factors and  economic market characteristics may also help identify trends within the scope of the  cybersecurity market analysis and in the context of supply-side and demand-side research.  Market trends can be of manifold nature. Some industries –- typically with low risk –- might  need to follow technological developments. Others might orient themselves towards  changes in the threat landscape affecting their sector. In those cases, market trends can be  connected to technology foresight and threat analysis.  The maturity of particular cybersecurity markets can be analysed through the penetration of  cybersecurity products in the value chain of an organisation, the ratio of cybersecurity  spending in IT investments, the number of incidents impacting their business, level of  cybersecurity capability, etc. The maturity is indicated by the number of iterations a  technology has experienced.  In the following subsections, we provide examples of trends in the cybersecurity domain.  Rise in cybercrime and cyber attacks  Estimates of the cost of cybercrime and cyber attacks vary significantly, but all estimates  show a rise in cybercrime and cyberattacks. If the market analyst can illuminate the costs of  cybercrime and cyber attacks in the chosen market segment, so much the better. The  market analyst must make a considered judgment regarding how susceptible (or not) a new  technology or service might be to cyber attacks.  Criminals are innovators. They are interested in new technologies if they will support their  malign intents. Blockchain, for example, was helpful in disguising their transactions and,  especially, for money laundering. Criminals have played with deepfakes for advancing  pornography and social engineering. They have also begun to use artificial intelligence. The  market analyst will need to make an estimation of how criminal use of new technologies  might impact the market segment chosen for analysis.  Cybercrime as a service has also been facilitating the growth in cyber attacks, so that  anyone can get tailor-made tools and lists of potential victims at a fraction of the cost of  developing such tools themselves.  Growth in the attack surface  The Internet of Things (IoT) already numbers billions of devices in use and that number is  expected to grow rapidly in the next few years. The IoT includes the chips in your toaster,  fridge, oven and other appliances, but also the SCADA devices in critical infrastructure and  ENISA CYBERSECURITY MARKET ANALYSIS FRAMEWORK V2.0  Final | Version 2.0 | Public | March 2023  48  driverless vehicles, where the risk of manipulation keeps cybersecurity experts awake at  night. The IoT is greatly expanding the cyber attack surface.  Growth in the type of cybercriminal and cyber attacker  Not only is the attack surface growing, the range of cybercriminals and cyber attacks has  also been growing, partly because malware and the instruments for deploying it are  declining in cost and expertise.  So cybercriminals and cyber attackers range from state-sponsored attackers to attackers  who free-lance for government agencies on one day and on their own account the next.  They include organised crime gangs, like the mafia, to discontented individuals and  braggards who want to show off their expertise in taking down big companies or  government agencies.  ASSESS THE SUSTAINABILITY, INNOVATION AND EVOLUTION OF  THE MARKET  The market analyst should include in his or her analysis study some assessments or  predictions about the sustainability of the market segment and how it might evolve over the  next five years or more and what innovations might arise during that time to propel or  undermine the market. Sustainability means more than a growing number of customers: it  also means its environmental sustainability and, particularly, the UN Sustainable  Development Goals.59  COMPARE VIEWS  The analysis should highlight any views that either support or are at variance with the  analyst’s finding. He or she should bring those other views to the attention of his or her  senior managers or whoever is funding the market analysis. Views that support our market  analysis are always welcome, of course, but even other views may be welcome in showing  the need for more in-depth research. More conservative market analyses may also be  welcome in terms of injecting a note of caution into decisions to invest in or grow a particular  market. Contrary views are not always genuine; hence, the analyst should determine who  funded and sponsored contrary studies and what might have been their motive in doing so.  To help the analyst undertake the analysis, we have added some reference questions,  which are indicative only; others can be added.  Questions:  • What findings are interesting for the addressees of your analysis?  • Do the data collected show any gaps between demand and supply?  • What specific contextual factors are relevant for your market analysis?  • Which trends could affect your market forecasts, either for selling or procuring  products, services or processes?  • Have you searched whether there are other market analyses that have already  been conducted in your area of interest?  59 https://sdgs.un.org/goals  https://sdgs.un.org/goals  ENISA CYBERSECURITY MARKET ANALYSIS FRAMEWORK V2.0  Final | Version 2.0 | Public | March 2023  49  STEP 7: DISSEMINATE THE  RESULTS  The organisation conducting the analysis will decide on whether to make the market  analysis public.  The three main actions in this step are:  • Identify the tools for presenting the results  • Visualise the results with good graphics  • Assess the effectiveness of the dissemination activities.  IDENTIFY THE TOOLS FOR PRESENTING THE RESULTS  In presenting the market analysis, the analyst should consider who the decision-makers are,  who will make the ultimate decision to promulgate (or not) the results of the market analysis.  The decision-maker may have some strategic or tactical considerations of which the analyst  is unaware in the decision to promulgate those results.  The market analyst should consider how he or she should present the results of the market  analysis to the aforementioned decision-makers. There are various ways of doing so – a  report, a slide presentation, a video, a webinar, online, etc. Various tools can be employed,  none mutually exclusive.  VISUALISE THE RESULTS WITH GOOD GRAPHICS  The target audience will absorb better the findings of the market analysis if they are  presented in a visually and graphically pleasing way. No matter how great the market  analysis is, if it is not presented in a user-friendly format, and if the target stakeholders are  baffled by the results, the analysis will have been for naught. Think carefully about  visualising the results of the analysis and how to present them. Remember the adage: a  picture is worth a thousand words.  ASSESS THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE DISSEMINATION ACTIVITIES  The market analyst will want to know how colleagues, management and stakeholders have  received his or her analysis and, especially, how successful he or she has been in  disseminating the results of the analysis. As noted above, there are various tools that can  be used to disseminate the results; some will be more successful, more effective than  others. For future reference, for new market analyses, the analyst will want to learn lessons,  to learn which dissemination activities work best. The analyst should assess the  effectiveness of the various activities within a month or so of submitting his or her results  while those results are reasonably fresh in the minds of the target stakeholders.  Just as there are different means of dissemination, there are different ways of measuring  their effectiveness. For example, if the analyst’s organisation has released a press release  about the analysis, then the analyst can monitor how many news outlets (traditional media,  newspapers, magazines, websites) have picked up the press release. Publishing the press  release on the organisation’s website, the analyst can see if there have been more site  visits and click-throughs. He or she can convene a focus group to understand the views of a  cross-section of stakeholders about the analysis and how it has been presented.  ENISA CYBERSECURITY MARKET ANALYSIS FRAMEWORK V2.0  Final | Version 2.0 | Public | March 2023  50  CONCLUSIONS AND WAYS  FORWARD  In this section, we draw some brief conclusions and suggestions about the way forward.  First, this cybersecurity market analysis responds, in part, to an obligation on ENISA by the  Cybersecurity Act (CSA)60, which was referenced in the Introduction above. Art. 8 par. 7 of  the CSA says that “ENISA shall perform and disseminate regular analyses of the main  trends in the cybersecurity market on both the demand and supply sides, with a view to  fostering the cybersecurity market in the Union”. The ECSMAF provides guidance on the  things that should be taken into account in conducting cybersecurity market analyses. It  contributes to the implementation of the CSA: it supports a strong EU cybersecurity market;  it supports the regulatory oversight of the market; it supports cybersecurity certification, as  provided in the CSA. It also supports the EU’s December 2020 Cybersecurity Strategy for  the Digital Decade61.  Second, this cybersecurity market analysis framework is a guidance targeting several  different cybersecurity stakeholders, including market researchers and strategists and other  cybersecurity analysts. We have made it as readable and accessible as possible to  stakeholders.  SCENARIOS AND FORESIGHT  The analyst might wish to develop scenarios indicating technology adoption, application and  its impacts as well as its threats and opportunities. Drawing scenarios helps the analyst and  stakeholders understand the challenges facing the development of the market segment, the  requirements for mitigating risks, reducing threats relating to the deployment, operational  and societal issues of technology adoption.  The market analyst, together with colleagues and/or stakeholders, can create a scenario of  what they would like the market segment to look like in five years, for example. The  construction of the scenario (as well as the market analysis itself) can be accompanied by  other foresight techniques such as horizon scanning or Delphi exercises. Constructing a  desired, but reasonably realistic scenario, is followed by backcasting, i.e., what steps do we  need to take to arrive at the desired scenario? The market analyst should bring together a  diverse group of stakeholders to participate in the scenario construction exercise to avoid  missing any important perspectives. At the outset of that exercise, the market analyst can  present his or her findings and views of where the market segment could or should be in the  chosen time frame. The participants can express their points of view about what steps  should be taken to arrive at the desired scenario and what hurdles might have to be crossed  to get there. The market analyst should then draft the scenario based on the discussion and  then run the scenario by those participating in the exercise for their comments before  drafting a new final version reflecting those comments as well as the actions to be taken to  arrive at the desired scenario.62  60 Regulation (EU) 2019/881 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17 April 2019 on ENISA (the European  Union Agency for Cybersecurity) and on information and communications technology cybersecurity certification and  repealing Regulation (EU) No 526/2013 (Cybersecurity Act), https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal- content/EN/ALL/?uri=CELEX%3A32019R0881.  61Joint Communication to the European Parliament and the Council, The EU's Cybersecurity Strategy for the Digital  Decade, https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/ALL/?uri=JOIN:2020:18:FIN  62 There are hundreds of articles on writing scenarios. Here is one, which can be used as a guide to construction of  scenarios with increasing stakeholder consultation.

The section on  scenarios and foresight could form part of Step 7 or it could come even earlier as part of  Step 5. As we mentioned in the Introduction, the market analyst does not need to follow the  framework slavishly; he or she can pick from the detailed table of contents which bits he or  she might want to use and set aside other parts. The section on scenarios and foresight is a  case in point; the analyst might wish to engage in scenario construction and foresight as an  aide to market analysis or at the conclusion, that is, the market analysis can serve as an  input to the scenario construction.  THE WAY FORWARD  This is the second version of the framework, ECSMAF Version 2.0 (V2.0). It is an evolution  of the ECSMAF Version 1.0 (V1.0)63 with the lessons learned from the pilots, i.e. the ENISA  EU Cybersecurity Market Analysis - IoT in Distribution Grids64 and Cloud Cybersecurity  Market Analysis65.  It is entirely possible that it will be followed by subsequent versions, especially based on the  lessons learned from other pilot analyses that may be conducted in the future and if we  receive feedback from stakeholders about how we can improve it and how they can use it to  improve the EU’s position in the cybersecurity domain. Doing so is not only to vitalise the  EU cybersecurity market, but also to contribute to the EU digital sovereignty.66  To help the analyst undertake the analysis, we have added some reference questions,  which are indicative only; others can be added.  Questions:  • Which would be the best tool(s) that you have already available or you could  easily procure for presenting the results?  • Which visualisation elements can you use for presenting the results?  • Do the tool(s) and visualisation elements you intend to use have the results of  your analysis reaching the target audience?  • Have you considered constructing a scenario of where your organisation would  like to be in (say) five years?  • Have you contemplated which stakeholders you could invite to a brainstorming  session for constructing the scenario?  63 ENISA Cybersecurity Market Analysis Framework (ECSMAF) -

Moreover, market data on cybersecurity products, services and processes are scarcely taken  into account in the cybersecurity development lifecycle, e.g., within decision-making  processes for the launching and development of cybersecurity initiatives, product ideas, policy  actions, research funding and deployments. According to Article 8 par. 7 of the Cybersecurity  Act (CSA)1, ENISA has been tasked to “perform and disseminate regular analyses of the main  trends in the cybersecurity market on both the demand and supply sides, with a view to  fostering the cybersecurity market in the Union”.  This document is the cornerstone of ENISA activities in analysing the EU cybersecurity  market. It presents a cybersecurity market analysis framework, a guidance, on how EU  cybersecurity market analyses can be performed and be:  • More transparent: a better structuring of the analysis method and understanding of  the market, market trends and stakeholders lead to more transparency regarding the  results of the analysis.  • More comparable: a structured analysis process makes results more comparable and  reusable.  • More customisable towards technology and market trends: the updated market  analysis framework can be better customised to take account of trends and dynamics  in the cybersecurity market as well as forecasts, market gaps and market niches.  • More agile: the inherent flexibility of setting the market analysis focus and adapting  the analysis process to the needs increases the agility of the proposed market  analysis method.  • More comprehensive: the inclusion of possible variables, criteria and contextual  information on cybersecurity, as well as requirements and dependencies both from  the supply and the demand sides, increases the comprehensiveness of the proposed  market analysis method.  • More coherent: the framework facilitates information exchanges of specific market  analysis reports, their re-usability and coherence of both raw market data and the  analysis of the results.  This framework is subject to future iterations. With increasing performance of cybersecurity  market analyses and interactions with stakeholders, ENISA will further develop and update  the current framework to increase its efficacy and practicability.  The framework comprises seven major steps to help the analyst conduct a cybersecurity  market analysis, as follows:  Step 1 – Choose the market segment for analysis  Step 2 – Scope the market segment analysis  Step 3 – Analyse the market segment  Step 4 – Decide what to ask stakeholders  Step 5 – Collect the data  Step 6 – Analyse the data  Step 7 – Disseminate the results.  1 Regulation (EU) 2019/ of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17 April 2019 on ENISA (the European  Union Agency for Cybersecurity) and on information and communications technology cybersecurity certification and  repealing Regulation (EU) No 526/2013,  https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal- content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32019R0881&from=EN.  https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32019R0881&from=EN https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32019R0881&from=EN  ENISA CYBERSECURITY MARKET ANALYSIS FRAMEWORK V2.0  Final | Version 2.0 | Public | March 2023  8  The framework is targeted at supporting various stakeholders, including the following2:  • EU institutions, bodies and agencies (EUIBAs)  • National public authorities, especially cybersecurity authorities  • Industry  • Companies providing cybersecurity products, services and/or processes (supply  side)  • Companies needing cybersecurity products, services and/or processes (demand  side)  • Consumer organisations and associations  • Research institutions  • Other ENISA stakeholders.  Depending on their requirements, market analyses could have different types of users and  stakeholders.  2 There are different ways of grouping. Another way of grouping stakeholders could for instance include: SMEs, Clients  and Customers, Supply chain participants, and End-users.  ENISA CYBERSECURITY MARKET ANALYSIS FRAMEWORK V2.0  Final | Version 2.0 | Public | March 2023  9  INTRODUCTION  What distinguishes the conduct of a cybersecurity market analysis from any other market  analysis?  Cybersecurity is inherently about security, hence, the rules governing the market are  different from those selling toothpaste. Some details may be confidential.3 Many of those  with whom the cybersecurity market analyst would like to consult may not wish to reveal  much information. It may be challenging to gather the data to make an informed market  analysis and informed decision about whether to enter the market.  Such sensitivities may be at work on both the demand side (those wishing to procure a  cybersecurity solution) and on the supply side (those wishing to sell their solutions), which  may complicate the high-level analysis of both sides undertaken by public authorities and  industry associations.  Some cybersecurity products, services or processes may be subject to secrecy obligations  or commercial sensitivities. Some products may raise social concerns such as the  navigation systems on our smart phones that allow the big companies to know where we  are and often what we are doing (picking up the kids from school, going shopping, hanging  out at the gym, going for a drink with colleagues).  Cybersecurity solutions, needs and requirements are often kept confidential so that hackers  and attackers are not tipped off about the actions of the defender.  Unlike many other markets, the cybersecurity market is highly competitive, as the European  Council has determined that it is populated by 60,000 companies4 – some niche companies  and some full-service companies.  The sensitive nature of cybersecurity for companies means a general unwillingness to share  data and information. This difficult access to information is compounded by the fact that the  cybersecurity market is a diluted and fragmented market – diluted because it is often part of  or embedded within other markets – fragmented because it is composed of a myriad of  actors.  Given the considerable multiplicity of cybersecurity products, services and processes, a  credible cybersecurity market analysis may need to go significantly deeper than other  market analyses. Furthermore, cybersecurity is dynamic; it is evolving constantly as  attackers adopt new technologies and new strategies to carry out their attacks.  Cybersecurity functions are often a component within existing products, services and  processes. A detailed decomposition is often needed to assess various market  characteristics of products, such as role, level of market penetration, and market value.  Until recently, market analyses and assessments have been performed mainly by experts  with an economics background. Cybersecurity market analysis, however, requires a  significant, multi-disciplinary, technically oriented, cybersecurity knowledge. A multi-  disciplinary approach helps address the challenges of defining the boundaries of different  3 Confidential here does not explicitly refer to EU classification levels, although it could. The main point is to hide or  guard sensitive data against potential attackers.  4 https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/policies/cybersecurity/#funding  https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/policies/cybersecurity/#funding  ENISA CYBERSECURITY MARKET ANALYSIS FRAMEWORK V2.0  Final | Version 2.0 | Public | March 2023  10  cybersecurity market segments. Hence, there are many differences between the conduct of  a cybersecurity market analysis and other types of market analysis.  This new version of the ECSMAF Version 2.0 (V2.0) is an evolution of the ECSMAF Version  1.0 (V1.0)5 with the lessons learned from the pilots, i.e. the ENISA EU Cybersecurity Market  Analysis - IoT in Distribution Grids6 and the Cloud Cybersecurity Market Analysis 7, and the  contributions of the ENISA AHWG on EU Cybersecurity Market. More evolutions are  expected, as ENISA continues to improve its guidance to cybersecurity stakeholders. Future  analyses will be able to use V2.0 as a guidance and, in due course, V3.0. Hence, some  differences in the structures and approaches of the cybersecurity market analyses based on  this framework are inevitable in this still evolving stage.  AIMS OF THIS FRAMEWORK  This cybersecurity market analysis framework aims to:  • perform \"analyses of the main trends in the cybersecurity market on both the  demand and supply sides, with a view to fostering the cybersecurity market in the  Union\"8;  • define a method for market analysts for  o analysing cybersecurity market segments;  o amalgamating knowledge from cybersecurity market analyses;  • serve as a guide for any stakeholder undertaking a cybersecurity market analysis.  This framework is mainly intended to help ENISA and its stakeholders:  • identify cybersecurity fields that are innovative, emerging and have potential for  both demand and supply;  • identify cybersecurity market investment opportunities and risks based on demand  and supply requirements;  • help promote an EU-based security market and its objectives by analysing and  monitoring the EU cybersecurity market and its evolution;  • assess the importance of market segments in the context of potential threats and  vulnerabilities;  • assess market needs for cybersecurity certification; and  • leverage cybersecurity market data for informed policy decisions regarding  cybersecurity within the EU and Member States;  • support the European cybersecurity market analysts by applying more rigour and a  more comprehensive, structured approach to the analysis of the market prospects  for new products, services and/or processes.  TARGET AUDIENCE  We have prepared this framework as an aide to those who wish to undertake an analysis of  a cybersecurity market segment.  We can distinguish two types of customers or users of the ECSMAF: those with a fixed  budget who have to adapt their strategy to their budget and those (high assurance)  customers for whom budget is not the main limitation whereas assurance is.  We especially address market analysts, a term that we use in a broad sense and not  confined to the private sector. On the contrary, we are especially addressing market  analysts who work for the institutions listed below. These institutions are interested in a  5 ENISA, ENISA Cybersecurity Market Analysis Framework (ECSMAF), Version 1.0,  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/enisa-cybersecurity-market-analysis-framework-ecsmaf.  6 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/eu-cybersecurity-market-analysis-iot-in-distribution-grid  7 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/cloud-cybersecurity-market-analysis  8 Art. 8 par. 7 of the CSA, https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32019R0881&from=EN.  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/enisa-cybersecurity-market-analysis-framework-ecsmaf https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/eu-cybersecurity-market-analysis-iot-in-distribution-grid https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/cloud-cybersecurity-market-analysis https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32019R0881&from=EN  ENISA CYBERSECURITY MARKET ANALYSIS FRAMEWORK V2.0  Final | Version 2.0 | Public | March 2023  11  higher level view of the markets, both the demand and supply sides, than individual  companies who are more interested in the prospects for their product, service or process.  Nevertheless, while companies are not the main targeted stakeholders, they too may find  that this framework provides a useful tool.  The framework is targeted at supporting the following stakeholders:  • EU institutions, bodies and agencies (EUIBAs), e.g., the European Commission  and its Directorates Generals, such as DG-CNECT, DG-GROW, DG-JRC, DG-  RTD, DG-TRADE, but also Eurostat9 and the European Cybersecurity  Competence Centre (ECCC)10. EU regulations and impact assessments often take  into account market issues. Market analyses are important to help policymakers  understand trends as well as related demand and supply issues. Market analyses  can help shape future calls in Horizon Europe and other EU programmes where  there are market gaps.  • National public authorities, especially cybersecurity authorities. Cybersecurity  market surveillance is subject to regulation. The framework and its application may  help in comparative market analyses and identifying shared efforts between the  Member States.  • ENISA stakeholder groups, e.g., the European Cybersecurity Certification Group  (ECCG)11, Stakeholder Cybersecurity Certification Group (SCCG)12, and ENISA  Advisory Group13. The framework may support decision-making for prioritising  certification efforts and spotting market gaps.  • Industry and cross-sectoral associations, e.g., TIC Council14, the European Cyber  Security Organisation (ECSO)15 and the Information Security Forum (ISF)16.  Industry and professional associations can use the framework to analyse market  opportunities, trends, challenges and vulnerabilities and the creation of competitive  advantages to EU industry players.  • Consumer organisations and associations, e.g., European Association for  Coordinating Consumer Representation in Standardisation (ANEC)17 and the  European Consumer Organisation (BEUC)18. By using this framework, such  organisations may assess the needs and requirements of consumers for  cybersecurity products, services and processes, and their prospects in the  European cybersecurity market.  • Research institutions may use the proposed methodology to assess the maturity of  existing products and markets and guide the development of new technologies and  services.  • Companies providing cybersecurity products, services and/or processes (supply  side). As noted above, the European Council has estimated that there are 60,000  such companies in Europe. Some are major companies who already conduct  sophisticated market analyses, but by far the majority could benefit from some  market analysis advice. For some companies, cybersecurity is their principal  business; for others, it is just one line of business among others.  • Companies who need cybersecurity technologies, products, services and/or  processes (demand side). Such companies may have information security  professionals and/or procurement personnel who need to improve their companies’  cybersecurity. Hence, they need to analyse what is available on the market to meet  their needs and requirements.  9 https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat  10 https://cybersecurity-centre.europa.eu/index_en  11 https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/cybersecurity-certification-group  12 https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/stakeholder-cybersecurity-certification-group  13 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/about-enisa/structure-organization/advisory-group  14 https://www.tic-council.org/  15 https://ecs-org.eu/  16 https://www.securityforum.org/  17 https://www.anec.eu  18 https://www.beuc.eu  https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat https://cybersecurity-centre.europa.eu/index_en https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/cybersecurity-certification-group https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/stakeholder-cybersecurity-certification-group https://www.enisa.europa.eu/about-enisa/structure-organization/advisory-group https://www.tic-council.org/ https://ecs-org.eu/ https://www.securityforum.org/ https://www.anec.eu/ https://www.beuc.eu/  ENISA CYBERSECURITY MARKET ANALYSIS FRAMEWORK V2.0  Final | Version 2.0 | Public | March 2023  12  • Venture capitalists, to make them aware of investment opportunities in the  cybersecurity realm.  POLICY CONTEXT  ENISA supports cybersecurity market analysis in line with Article 8 and Title III of the  Cybersecurity Act (CSA), which stipulates that consideration of developments in the  cybersecurity market is a focus of the legislation, in particular, in the context of certification.  The CSA considers certification as a main instrument for “avoiding the fragmentation of the  internal market”19. The goal of cybersecurity certification is “to improve the functioning of the  internal market” (Art. 56 CSA). To achieve this goal, the CSA foresees actions to analyse  market trends. The CSA says that:  • “ENISA shall perform and disseminate regular analyses of the main trends in the  cybersecurity market on both the demand and supply sides, with a view to  fostering the cybersecurity market in the Union” (Art. 8 par. 7 CSA);  • “ENISA should develop and maintain a ‘market observatory’ by performing regular  analyses and disseminating information on the main trends in the cybersecurity  market, on both the demand and supply sides” (Recital 42 CSA).  In performing these tasks, ENISA receives advice and guidance from the Stakeholder  Cybersecurity Certification Group (SCCG). The SCCG “upon request, advise[s] ENISA on  general and strategic matters concerning ENISA’s tasks relating to market, cybersecurity  certification, and standardisation” (Art. 22 par. 3 (b) CSA).  The ENISA work on the EU cybersecurity market aims to contribute to the reduction in EU  internal market fragmentation and to provide input to:  • the Union Rolling Work Programme for European Cybersecurity Certification by  means of “market demand” (Art. 47 CSA);  • the promotion of “the use of European cybersecurity certification, with a view to  avoiding the fragmentation of the internal market. ENISA shall contribute to the  establishment and maintenance of a European cybersecurity certification  framework in accordance with Title III of this Regulation, with a view to increasing  the transparency of the cybersecurity of ICT products, ICT services and ICT  processes, thereby strengthening trust in the digital internal market and its  competitiveness” (Art 4.6 CSA).  Moreover, based on market information, ENISA can provide support in the coordination of  the Member States’ efforts in market surveillance for supervision of certification.20 The CSA  provides that:  • The national cybersecurity certification authorities “supervise and enforce rules  included in European cybersecurity certification scheme [...] for the monitoring of  the compliance of ICT products, ICT services and ICT processes with the  requirements of the European cybersecurity certificates that have been issued in  their respective territories, in cooperation with other relevant market surveillance  authorities” (Art. 58 par 7 (a) CSA).  Some EU legislative initiatives that are worth it to be mentioned because they might be of  relevance to the cybersecurity market are the following:  19 See Article 1 par. 1 (b) CSA.  20 Since this effort concerns compliance issues of certification, it may be used as a tool to obtain valuable information  on various aspects of the cybersecurity market. ENISA will coordinate efforts with Member States and the Commission  to increase the usability of this source within the context of the Activity 7 of the ENISA Single Programming Document  (SPD) 2022-2024. https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/corporate-documents/enisa-single-programming- document-2022-2024.  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/corporate-documents/enisa-single-programming-document-2022-2024 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/corporate-documents/enisa-single-programming-document-2022-2024  ENISA CYBERSECURITY MARKET ANALYSIS FRAMEWORK V2.0  Final | Version 2.0 | Public | March 2023  13  • The proposed Cyber Resilience Act (CRA)21 that foresees an obligation for the  manufacturers and vendors to comply with cybersecurity requirements to address  market needs and protect consumers from insecure products and services. It will  introduce common cybersecurity rules for connected products and associated  services. The CRA will complement the NIS2 Directive and the Cybersecurity Act.  It will also complement the Delegated Regulation of 29 October 2021 under the  Radio Equipment Directive, by setting up streamlined cybersecurity requirements  covering a wide range of digital products and their ancillary services.  • The proposed new Directive on the security of network and information systems  (NIS2) that is “part of a package of measures to further improve the resilience and  incident response capacities of public and private entities, competent authorities  and the EU as a whole. It covers the field of cybersecurity and critical infrastructure  protection“.22  The ENISA Single Programming Document 2022-2024 (SPD)23 takes account of these  provisions and sets up corresponding actions under Activity 7, with the aim of fostering  “a cybersecurity market (products and services) in the EU and the development of  the cybersecurity industry and services, in particular SMEs and start-ups, to reduce  the dependence from outside the Union and to reinforce supply chains inside the  Union. It involves actions to promote and implement ‘security by design’ and  ‘security by default’ measures in ICT products, services and processes, including  through standardisation”.  By delivering information on the cybersecurity market, ENISA provides support towards  implementation of various European Commission initiatives helping companies (SMEs,  micro-enterprises) improve business and production processes, products or services using  digital technologies. Examples of such initiatives include:  • European Digital Innovation Hubs24: market analyses provide evidence towards  helping “SMEs expand and tap into other markets, develop EU value chains,  create new business opportunities for companies or help commercialise earlier  innovation experiments or pilots”25;  • Emerging industries and value chains26: market analysis is an important instrument  that may “help SMEs to innovate and develop cross-sectoral value chains by  bringing different sectors and areas of expertise together to create new value  chains across the EU and Horizon 2020 associated countries”.  To respond to the above exigencies, ENISA began analysing the cybersecurity market, as  stipulated by the CSA. It created an Ad Hoc Working Group (AHWG) on the EU  Cybersecurity Market27 and published in April 2022 the first version of the ENISA  Cybersecurity Market Analysis Framework Version 1.0 (ECSMAF V1.0), the output of which  was intended to facilitate market analysis.28 This updated framework – Version 2.0  (ECSMAF V2.0) is the successor to the ECSMAF V1.0. There are quite some differences  between V1.0 and V2.0, partly based on the pilots29 of the ECSMAF V1.0 and the feedback  21 Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on horizontal cybersecurity requirements  for products with digital elements and amending Regulation (EU) 2019/1020. https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/better- regulation/have-your-say/initiatives/13410-Cyber-resilience-act-new-cybersecurity-rules-for-digital-products-and- ancillary-services_en . Possible future versions of the ECSMAF may recommend to consider goals and (measurable)  effects from the CRA more explicitly.  22 https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/nis-directive  23 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/corporate-documents/enisa-single-programming-document-2022-2024  24 https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/activities/edihs.  25 https://ec.europa.eu/newsroom/dae/document.cfm?doc_id=70324.  26 https://ec.europa.eu/growth/industry/strategy/cluster-policy/emerging-industries-and-value-chains_en.  27 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/market/ad-hoc-working-group-on-cybersecurity-market  28 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/enisa-cybersecurity-market-analysis-framework-ecsmaf  29 The EU Cybersecurity Market Analysis - IoT in Distribution Grids, available at  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/eu-cybersecurity-market-analysis-iot-in-distribution-grid and the Cloud  Cybersecurity Market Analysis, available at https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/cloud-cybersecurity-market- analysis.  https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/better-regulation/have-your-say/initiatives/13410-Cyber-resilience-act-new-cybersecurity-rules-for-digital-products-and-ancillary-services_en https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/better-regulation/have-your-say/initiatives/13410-Cyber-resilience-act-new-cybersecurity-rules-for-digital-products-and-ancillary-services_en https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/better-regulation/have-your-say/initiatives/13410-Cyber-resilience-act-new-cybersecurity-rules-for-digital-products-and-ancillary-services_en https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/nis-directive https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/corporate-documents/enisa-single-programming-document-2022-2024 https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/activities/edihs https://ec.europa.eu/newsroom/dae/document.cfm?doc_id=70324 https://ec.europa.eu/growth/industry/strategy/cluster-policy/emerging-industries-and-value-chains_en https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/market/ad-hoc-working-group-on-cybersecurity-market https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/enisa-cybersecurity-market-analysis-framework-ecsmaf https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/eu-cybersecurity-market-analysis-iot-in-distribution-grid https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/cloud-cybersecurity-market-analysis https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/cloud-cybersecurity-market-analysis  ENISA CYBERSECURITY MARKET ANALYSIS FRAMEWORK V2.0  Final | Version 2.0 | Public | March 2023  14  from stakeholders, and partly because the authors of V2.0 wanted a simpler, easier-to-  grasp framework.  ENISA CYBERSECURITY MARKET ANALYSIS FRAMEWORK V2.0  Final | Version 2.0 | Public | March 2023  15  HOW TO USE THIS FRAMEWORK  The framework consists of seven steps, which the market analyst can follow for identifying a  segment of the cybersecurity market to be analysed and for conducting the analysis.  Step 1: Choose the market segment for analysis  Step 2: Scope the market segment for analysis  Step 3: Analyse the market segment  Step 4: Decide what to ask stakeholders  Step 5: Collect the data  Step 6: Analyse the data  Step 7: Disseminate the results  Figure 1: Cybersecurity market analysis steps and actions  ENISA CYBERSECURITY MARKET ANALYSIS FRAMEWORK V2.0  Final | Version 2.0 | Public | March 2023  16  The first two steps of a cybersecurity market analysis are: Step 1 - Choose the market  segment for analysis and Step 2 - Scope the market segment for analysis. These steps set  the parameters of the analysis. These parameters set the topic, breadth and depth of the  analysis and determine the resources needed for the study, whether in terms of time,  budget, human resources or tools. The third step – Step 3 – Analyse the market segment –  consists of a closer look at the market segment and all its elements, ranging from the  infrastructure or architecture of the supply chains, value chain and value stack, assets,  threats to those assets, safety controls protecting the assets as well as a snapshot of the  major market segment actors. The combined outputs of Steps 1, 2 and 3 influence the  structured formulation of questions in Step 4 – Decide what to ask stakeholders that take  into account the scope of the analysis, the elements of the market segment and the types of  stakeholders who will answer the questions. Step 5 – Collect the data is the actual process  of data collection, using the questions developed in Step 4, but also the use of other primary  and secondary research. Following data collection, Step 6 – Analyse the data represents a  methodical analysis of the data, including an analysis of patterns and the formation of topics  or outputs of the analysis. Step 7 – Disseminate the results involves careful consideration of  how these outputs are presented, including the consideration of potential audiences,  timelines, formats, etc.  The market analyst can follow the steps sequentially, carrying out the first and then the next  and so on. However, we have provided a detailed table of contents so that the market  analyst can refer to particular sections or subsections without needing to follow the whole  process if he or she does not need to do so. Each step and this current “How to use this  Framework” chapter has some explanatory text followed by some questions, marked off in a  blue box, to help the analyst undertake the analysis. The questions are intended to be  indicative. Others can be added.  All of the steps involve iterative horizontal activities, in particular Validation with  stakeholders and Contextualisation.  Concerning Validation, in Step 1 of the analysis, the market analyst consults stakeholders  and/or his or her managers who have sponsored or will benefit from the study on which  market segments should be analysed. In Step 2, the market analyst, in consultation with  stakeholders (internal and external), selects the criteria to be used in scoping the market  analysis. In Step 3, the analyst describes the market segment to be analysed, which may  require validation or consultation with external stakeholders, such as cybersecurity or  industry experts. In Step 4, the market analyst develops questions to gather the views of  stakeholders while keeping in mind that the questions to be asked will likely need to be  tailored to the particular stakeholder types. In Step 5, the analyst collects and processes  data from a variety of sources, including responses to the questions from stakeholders. The  analyst may usefully invite the stakeholders interviewed to review the synthesis. Step 6 is  about analysing the data collected. In Step 7, the market analyst selects which visualisation  methods to use and presents the results to stakeholders, external or internal to their  organisation, for final sign-off.  Concerning  Contextualisation, the market analyst should pay attention to:  − what is happening in the overall economy, especially with regard to market  characteristics such as market dynamics, competition, ownership, profitability, all  of which could affect the cybersecurity market segment being analysed;  − macro-environmental, political, regulatory and social factors since they impact the  cybersecurity market;  − the state of the art in technology research, trends in going beyond the state of the  art, and how an emerging technology might impact the market;  − the importance of the different segments from a disruption viewpoint. The main  issue with cybersecurity attacks is that they can disrupt a small retail shop or a  whole economy. A successful cyberattack on a small retail shop will not have the  ENISA CYBERSECURITY MARKET ANALYSIS FRAMEWORK V2.0  Final | Version 2.0 | Public | March 2023  17  same impact on the economy as one that disables energy or water supplies or  even defence systems.  While using this framework, the analyst should keep in mind the internal organisation of the  entity he or she is conducting the analysis for as well as the project management cycle that  the organisation follows, and engage relevant experts in the analysis as deemed  appropriate.  In addition to the above sections, the framework has several annexes to which the reader  can turn for more detail on specific aspects relevant for analysis of a particular market  segment.  To help the analyst undertake the analysis, we have added some reference questions, which  are indicative only; others can be added.  Questions:  • Are you clear on the objectives or purposes or aims of the market analysis you are  about to undertake?  • Have you formulated and agreed them with your senior managers?  • If you have been handed the objectives, have you asked yourself if they are clearly  written or could be revised to make them more precise?  • Do you and/or your team have the flexibility to deal with ad hoc or urgent requests  (new or modified objectives) as a result of an incident with far-reaching impacts?  • Have you considered for whom you will be conducting your cybersecurity market  analysis? Are your targets only people internal to your organisation or do they  include other decision-makers?  • Have you consulted or are you planning to consult with stakeholders to gather their  perspective on particular market segments, their growth prospects, the  opportunities for European industry?  • Do you foresee that your market analysis might be shared with others outside your  organisation?  • Have you developed a comprehensive contact list of target stakeholders?  • Have you read the whole of this framework? Do you know which bits you want to  use?  • Can you apply the framework for the analysis of your particular market segments?  • Are there any commercially confidential aspects of your market analysis that might  affect its distribution?  • Have you considered the workflow for implementing the market analysis?  ENISA CYBERSECURITY MARKET ANALYSIS FRAMEWORK V2.0  Final | Version 2.0 | Public | March 2023  18  STEP 1: CHOOSE THE MARKET  SEGMENT FOR ANALYSIS  If a market analyst is going to conduct a market analysis, he or she should first determine  what is the goal, the purpose, the objective of the analysis. The market analyst should  identify relevant potential market segments for analysis and choose which to pursue. The  ‘cybersecurity market’ is of vast proportions, especially when one considers the number of  existing and emerging technologies, users, types of cyber threats, cybersecurity providers  and solutions. The complexity of the cybersecurity market requires segmentation of the  market for more manageable analysis. The first step in a cybersecurity market analysis is  thus to broadly scan the cybersecurity market and identify the segments, technologies  and/or services of interest to the governmental authority, industry association or other  stakeholder for whom the analysis is to be undertaken. Market segments can revolve  around the supply chain of a technological product or a service, for example, cloud services,  5G networks, Internet of Things (IoT) products and services, etc. Surveying the market will  help determine whether some intervention or regulation or support is needed in the market.  This step includes the following actions:  • Establish the goal of the market analysis  • Assess the priorities  • Develop and assess validation criteria  • Identify the infrastructure and the stakeholders.  ESTABLISH THE GOAL OF THE MARKET ANALYSIS  The market analyst should clarify the goal of the market analysis to be conducted. The goal  should be as specific and concise as possible. The goal may be driven by legislation (e.g.,  the CSA). He or she should recognise that the goal may (need to) be recalibrated at a  subsequent step. The goal and scope of the analysis are linked. This framework is intended  for use at both macro and micro levels. By macro, we mean at industry or market segment  scale; by micro, we mean an individual technology or product, service or process.  ASSESS THE PRIORITIES  The market segment to be analysed may be chosen in different ways – suggested by  colleagues or experts or stakeholders30 or, in the instance of industry and consumer  associations, by their members. Funding opportunities or incentives, such as tax or R&D  credits, may factor in the setting of priorities. In smaller enterprises, the segment can be  assigned by company strategy or upper management, so the market analyst may have little  choice in the matter. In some instances, the markets to be analysed may be impelled by  legislation, such as the CSA31 or the proposed AI Act32 or proposed Cyber Resilience Act33.  The initial survey of the market may produce several market segments of interest. In such  scenarios, when choice is plenty, a transparent way of deciding the segment to be analysed  is to use a priority scoring table, like the one below. In this table, the market analyst can  either singlehandedly or as part of a working group or panel assign numeric values (1 to x)  30 https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/library/cyber-resilience-act. In the instance of ENISA, for example, a request  for priorities would be sent to the National Liaison Officers Network, the Advisory Group, the Ad Hoc Working Group  (AHWG) on the EU Cybersecurity Market Analysis, or ENISA internal stakeholders (all Units).  31 https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/ALL/?uri=CELEX%3A32019R0881  32 https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/library/proposal-regulation-laying-down-harmonised-rules-artificial- intelligence  33 https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=COM:2022:454:FIN  https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/library/cyber-resilience-act https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/ALL/?uri=CELEX%3A32019R0881 https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/library/proposal-regulation-laying-down-harmonised-rules-artificial-intelligence https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/library/proposal-regulation-laying-down-harmonised-rules-artificial-intelligence https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=COM:2022:454:FIN  ENISA CYBERSECURITY MARKET ANALYSIS FRAMEWORK V2.0  Final | Version 2.0 | Public | March 2023  19  or qualitative values (low, medium, high) to the relevance, impact or urgency of particular  segments. The added scores will produce a priority list and the first market segment on that  list becomes the chosen focus of the cybersecurity market analysis.  Table 1: Example of scoring cybersecurity market segment priorities  Proposed  market  segment  Threat/  urgency/  [optional  category]  Market  share/impact/need  (Supply)  Market share/impact/need  (Demand)  Relevance  for  analyst’s  company/  organisati on  Total  Big  comp anies  SMEs Macro  level  Big  compa nies  SMEs Macro  level  Market  segment A  Market  segment B  Market  segment C  Market  segment D  High relevance: 3 points; Medium relevance: 2 points; Low relevance: 1 point  In the example table, the first column lists the multiple market segments that the market  analyst shortlisted. The columns to the right are for illustration purposes and may be  adapted to the needs and triggers of the market analysis. The scores are tallied in the  rightmost column and the top scoring market segment is chosen for analysis.  DEVELOP AND ASSESS VALIDATION CRITERIA  As the market analyst contemplates the market segment to be analysed, he or she should  already be thinking about relevant criteria for validation of the market analysis, how to  assess different proposals from stakeholders for priorities to analyse and validating the  choice of segment to be analysed34. The criteria referenced in Step 2 and Annex 3 draw on  those mentioned in the first version of the ECSMAF.  IDENTIFY THE INFRASTRUCTURE AND THE STAKEHOLDERS  As the market analyst identifies the market segment, he or she should also identify the  infrastructure at stake, the value chain and value stack of the domain and the various assets  and actors involved (stakeholders at both the demand and supply-side, depending on the  scope). Analysis of these elements requires solid sectoral knowledge that will need to be  brought into the market analysis effort through sector or domain experts.  To help the analyst undertake the analysis, we have added some reference questions,  which are indicative only; others can be added.  Questions:  • What is the trigger of the cybersecurity market analysis (e.g., a policy action,  investment strategy, market intervention policy, market-supportive measures, a  cyber incident or threat, necessary risk mitigation, observed market trends)?  • Is the goal of your analysis clear, specific, not ambiguous?  • Do you have a method for prioritising market segments?  • Do you need validation for your choice? Who can validate the choice of your  market segment?  34 The criteria referenced in Step 2 and Annex 3 draw on those mentioned in the first version of the ECSMAF.  ENISA CYBERSECURITY MARKET ANALYSIS FRAMEWORK V2.0  Final | Version 2.0 | Public | March 2023  20  STEP 2: SCOPE THE MARKET  SEGMENT FOR ANALYSIS  Once the market analyst, on his or her own or as part of a working group, decides on the  market segment, the next step in the analysis is to set the scope of the analysis using  various criteria. Market analysts, whether at the EUIBAs or national authorities or  associations, will have differing resources and time at their disposition for the conduct of a  cybersecurity market analysis, hence, the level of detail they can analyse will similarly vary.  Moreover, they may find that it is not necessary to follow all of the steps nor undertake all of  the actions described in this framework. In such cases, they should only undertake those  steps, actions and horizontal activities that are relevant and in as much depth as time and  resources allow.  Familiarity with the market segment may also influence the scoping of the analysis. If the  market analyst is somewhat unfamiliar with the chosen market segment, this step may be  better left after Step 3 – Analyse the market segment, in which the market analyst breaks  down the market segment into its core elements. This order may improve the quality of the  analysis scoping exercise. If the market analyst has only a distant familiarity with the chosen  market segment, he or she should look for support from an expert advisory or working group  who can assist with setting the scope of the analysis. In other cases, the market analyst can  proceed directly to scoping the analysis using the prescribed criteria below. Given that Step  1 – Choose the market segment for analysis and Step 2 – Scope the market segment  analysis are non-linear, the market analyst needs to determine their order based on his or  her circumstances.  The aforementioned criteria help respond to market-relevant questions, in particular: What  will the analysis comprise (demand, supply, market penetration of product, services and  processes, market requirements, etc.)?  Step 2 includes the following actions:  • Set the scope  • Group scoping criteria  • Consider a budget for the market analysis.  SET THE SCOPE  Setting the scope includes:  • Balancing the resources available to conduct the analysis. The market analyst  may need to revise his or her initial estimates after performance of Step 3 when  he or she has a better idea of what would be involved in conducting a credible  market analysis. In scoping a particular market segment, the market analyst  should aim to capture all important market issues while taking into account  available resources for the conduct of the analysis.  • Agreeing the depth and breadth of analysis. The market analyst will need to  decide into what depth he or she can go, how far they can “drill” down into a topic.  Similarly, the analyst will need to decide on the “breadth” of the analysis, i.e., he  or she might be able to cover a wider range of cybersecurity markets, but not to  the depth they might like if they were not covering so many topics. Hence, the  market analyst may need to recalibrate his or her initial estimates after Step 3.  ENISA CYBERSECURITY MARKET ANALYSIS FRAMEWORK V2.0  Final | Version 2.0 | Public | March 2023  21  • Understanding the maturity of the market segment to be analysed. Analysis of  cybersecurity markets will most likely involve new and emerging technologies,  some of which will be more mature than others – mature, in the sense that they  have already penetrated their markets, at least to some credible extent.  The market analyst – and stakeholders – can set the depth and breadth of their analysis  using various criteria. The more criteria, the more granular will be their scoping.  Stakeholders, whether internal or external, can contribute to the number and precision of  criteria.35  The market analyst uses the scoping criteria for a specific analysis as the basis for market  research questions for stakeholders. Their responses, together with a literature review,  contribute to the raw material for preparation of the market analysis. The analyst  synthesises their responses into the content of the analysis. The market analyst should  circulate the draft analysis to selected stakeholders for comment before finalising it.  GROUP SCOPING CRITERIA  The scoping criteria can be grouped and subdivided according to various criteria, some of  which will be relevant and others not, it depends on the specific analysis conducted. The  criteria for scoping the analysis can emerge in different ways (from colleagues of the market  analyst, stakeholders, literature review, interviews, focus groups). Below, we present the  various criteria that the market analyst can consider in scoping his or her market segment.  Criteria for the demand side include the following:  • Business impact of procurement of the cybersecurity product, service or process  for the demand side  • Required demand-side capability or maturity for deploying the procured product,  service or process  • Role of the product or service or process in risk mitigation  • Demand-side presence in various geographic locations  • Demand-side requirements to be met by the procured product, service or process  • Identification of gaps in products, services or processes available to meet  demand-side requirements  • Investment plan for financing procurement of the product, service or process  • Assessment of generic company data for the demand side  • Market barriers to procuring the product, service or process.  Criteria for the supply side include the following:  • Business impact of the product, service or process for the supplier  • Capabilities to deploy the product, service or process  • Role of the product, service or process in reducing threats  • Presence in different geographic spaces of the supplier who delivers the product,  service or process  • Assessment of product requirements  • Gaps and emerging requirements  • Supply-side targets  • Supplier financial measures  • Investment plan to finance development of the product, service or process  • Assessment of supply-side company data  35 For example, members of ENISA AHWG on Cybersecurity Market Analysis have contributed to the scoping criteria  in the ENISA Cloud Cybersecurity Market Analysis, https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/cloud-cybersecurity- market-analysis.  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/cloud-cybersecurity-market-analysis https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/cloud-cybersecurity-market-analysis  ENISA CYBERSECURITY MARKET ANALYSIS FRAMEWORK V2.0  Final | Version 2.0 | Public | March 2023  22  • Market barriers.  Criteria for research & development include the following:  • Identification of market niches  • R&D financial figures  • R&D organisational details  • Assessment of relevant contemporary research activities in market area  • Assessment of efficient funding instruments  • Market drivers in related market area  • Market trends and barriers  • Importance of skills  • Innovative research topics in related technology areas.  Criteria for regulation include the following:  • Type, size and areas of influence of the organisation  • Market segments, areas, sectors under regulatory supervision  • Regulatory instruments used  • Cybersecurity threats the exposure to which will be reduced via regulatory activities  • Assessment of transition plans to new regulatory instruments  • Market drivers for regulatory compliance  • Market barriers for regulatory compliance  • Foreseen incentives to support transition by market players.  The various criteria above can be included in a table. The key question for each criterion  has a ‘yes’ or ‘no’ answer, namely: should this criterion be included in the analysis’s scope  or not? Here, as an example, is an extract from a table used in ENISA’s Cloud  Cybersecurity Market Analysis36.  Table 2: Scoping criteria table (sample)  Criteria  group  Criterion Included in  the scope?

Each of the criteria could lead to one or more questions. Step 4 of the  framework covers the use of the scoping criteria to formulate questions in more detail.  Annex 3 includes a detailed list of criteria used in the Cloud Cybersecurity Market  Analysis.37 Most of these criteria are applicable to the scoping of any cybersecurity market  analysis. However, there are also interrelationships and differently structured market  segments that should be considered by the analyst in each individual case.  CONSIDER A BUDGET FOR THE MARKET ANALYSIS  The market analyst should prepare a detailed budget for undertaking the market analysis.  This framework will help the analyst decide which activities he or she should undertake. The  market analyst should, however, call upon the expertise of others in his or her organisation  to have a realistic budget for the analysis. The budget should be as comprehensive as  possible and make provision for human resources, travel, materials, venue hire and catering  for focus groups, workshops, market surveys and other consultative methods. Strategic,  tactical and/or operational factors are likely to drive budget considerations.  At this stage, the market analyst needs to estimate the effort needed for the analysis. By  taking account of the available resources, the market analyst can check the feasibility of the  analysis. If there is a mismatch between the scope and available resources, the sponsors of  the analysis may need to adapt the analysis criteria and/or the available resources.  The analyst should ensure he or she has a budget agreed with their senior managers in  advance of undertaking the analysis. The analyst and his or her finance officer should  review the budget and ongoing costs regularly, at least monthly, to avoid the risk of an over-  run. If such an over-run seems desirable, the analyst should raise the matter as soon as  possible with his or her manager or whoever approved the budget initially.  To help the analyst undertake the analysis, we have added some reference questions, which  are indicative only; others can be added.  Questions:  37 ENISA, Cloud Cybersecurity Market Analysis, https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/cloud-cybersecurity-market- analysis.  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/cloud-cybersecurity-market-analysis https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/cloud-cybersecurity-market-analysis  ENISA CYBERSECURITY MARKET ANALYSIS FRAMEWORK V2.0  Final | Version 2.0 | Public | March 2023  24  • Have you considered the depth and breadth that would be necessary for  meaningful actions by government entities and industry associations?  • How much time do you have to conduct the market analysis?  • How familiar are you with the market segment that your analysis is targeting?  • May your colleagues suggest scoping criteria? May your stakeholders suggest  scoping criteria? May scoping criteria emerge from literature review?  • What findings are you hoping to get from the analysis? May interviews and  focus groups contribute to the scoping criteria?  • Do you know where and how you can get the resources needed to carry out the  analysis?  • What is the trigger for the cybersecurity market analysis (e.g., policy action,  investment strategy, market intervention, market-supportive measures,  incident/threat, risk mitigation, market trends, etc.)?  • What will be included in the analysis (demand, supply, market penetration of  products, services, processes, market requirements, etc.)?  • What are the market research questions that need to be covered by the  analysis?  • What is the content of the value chain and value stack in scope (depth vs.  breadth)?  • What are the main economic criteria for the market scanning (e.g., market size,  demand size, growth, market gaps, etc.)?  • Does the market analysis have a fixed budget?  • Who has to approve the budget for the market analysis?  ENISA CYBERSECURITY MARKET ANALYSIS FRAMEWORK V2.0  Final | Version 2.0 | Public | March 2023  25  STEP 3: ANALYSE THE MARKET  SEGMENT  Once the market analyst has identified the market segment for analysis, he or she has to  analyse it. This step does not strictly have to come after Step 2 – Scope the market  segment for analysis – and if an existing description or analysis of the market segment  exists and is readily available to the market analyst, the duration of this step can be  significantly shortened. Either way, the chosen market segment to be analysed will possess  certain unique traits and elements that distinguish it from other market segments. For  instance, the way in which the cloud market is structured is different from the way in which  the Internet of Things (IoT) is structured and that is different from the way in which the 5G  market is structured (or is being structured).  In addition to the structure (infrastructure, architecture, models, etc.), different market  segments have different assets that require cyber protection, have different threats  and vulnerabilities, and different solutions and controls to protect those assets.  Hence, the analyst may need to consider how a product, service or process is delivered to  customers, i.e., the supply chain, but also how along that path cybersecurity products,  services or processes play a role.  When analysing a market segment, the market analyst should first list its various building  blocks, such as infrastructure components, models and service architecture. In the context  of a cybersecurity market analysis, the role of the presented material is to set the scene for  the various cybersecurity properties, mechanisms, threat models, etc. of important market  segment assets. To identify these assets, the market analyst should list as many elements  as necessary to capture the market segment.  A good approach to this step is to rely on existing standards and expert publications. The  presented structure of a market segment will then be based on an open source analysis of  existing information found in various publications, standards and analyses. Most of the  collected material will reflect the status of the chosen market segment as it emerged in  recent years. The market analyst should thus be aware that existing literature can present a  rather static view of the market segment; hence, he or she should follow recent  developments and adoption of emerging technologies, such as IoT, 5G and AI, but also the  digital transformation imposed by events such as the Covid-19 pandemic.  Some relevant actions in this step are:  • Describe the infrastructure  • Identify assets  • Identify threats  • Identify requirements/challenges  • Identify value stack elements  • Identify market segment stakeholders.  The analyst should ensure he or she has validation, as a horizontal activity going on during  all steps, from relevant stakeholders, who can tell him or her if he or she is going in the right  direction.  One can envisage the value chain literally as a chain where the initial link for a developer  might be the development of the product and the final link might be deployment of the  ENISA CYBERSECURITY MARKET ANALYSIS FRAMEWORK V2.0  Final | Version 2.0 | Public | March 2023  26  product into the marketplace. Each stakeholder in the value chain might also have a value  stack that comprises the elements or components, services or processes that they bring to  the value chain. For example, in the value stack of the developer might be AI developers,  data scientists and technology researchers. Further along in the value chain might be a  system integrator who may have a value stack comprising software, red teams to see if they  can penetrate the software and network operators. Another link in the value chain might  contain a value stack comprising the sales team and lobbyists. See Annex 4 for examples of  value stack elements.  DESCRIBE THE INFRASTRUCTURE  The infrastructure of a market segment will differ from segment to segment. It represents  the unique constellation of physical points, including the software embedded in the  hardware, in which assets can be located. Despite the differences between market  segments, the market analyst can structure the description of the market segment  infrastructure according to the following levels:  • data level (data storage, data in transit, data channels)  • application level (listing all installed applications using the resources of the market  segment, including hardware and software details)  • network level (where are network nodes, supply channels, network security  elements).  Other additional levels may be relevant for specific market segments. The market analysts  can add these accordingly.  When describing the infrastructure, it is important to consider also the attributes of the  market segment. If the infrastructure describes the components of a market segment and  ‘things that exist’ in the market segment, the attributes describe how these elements work  and what they do. The attributes of a market segment also differ between individual  segments, but the market analyst can structure his or her description in the following way:  • essential attributes: how the resources and services are paid for, e.g., on-demand,  pay-as-you-go, resource-pooling, etc., usually used as rationale for pricing  differentiation;  • service models: a list of existing services offered in the market segment,  describing how the infrastructure or its elements are used and what their functions  are;  • deployment models: a list of choices by the stakeholders in the market segment  on the desired model of sharing, access and ownership of the available resources,  e.g., public, private, community, hybrid, etc.  The market analyst should also consider whether companies constitute a specific vertical  industry. The market analyst can assume that in every vertical industry a certain value chain  and value stack characterise the core business. Such knowledge will enhance transparency  and comparability and highlight nuances among stakeholders in the same industry.  Figure 2 below presents an example set of vertical industries. Cybersecurity is a “horizontal”  activity for such industries. They all need cybersecurity. Moreover, the supply chain of  vertical industries may entail cybersecurity as an integrated part of the offering, a built-in  feature of their offerings, but not their main product.  ENISA CYBERSECURITY MARKET ANALYSIS FRAMEWORK V2.0  Final | Version 2.0 | Public | March 2023  27  Figure 2: Vertical industries typically related to cybersecurity products, services and  processes  Originally published in ECSMAF, Version 1.0, the Figure above is just one example of how  vertical industries can be categorised. Another example could be a categorisation inspired by  the NIS Directive38 or by the proposed NIS2 Directive39 that list sectors and subsectors.  IDENTIFY ASSETS  A critical element in threat landscaping is identifying the assets and categories of assets to  which threats can be exposed. Assets are defined as anything that has value to an  individual or organisation, and therefore requires protection.40 Assets in a cybersecurity  market analysis could include infrastructure components (hardware), models, service  architectures, processes and processors, networks, data and software. They may be  physical assets as well as non-tangible assets (e.g., software or other intellectual property).  38 https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/ALL/?uri=CELEX%3A32016L1148  39 https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=COM%3A2020%3A823%3AFIN  40 ENISA, AI Cybersecurity Challenges: Threat Landscape for Artificial Intelligence, p. 22,  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/artificial-intelligence-cybersecurity-challenges.  https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/ALL/?uri=CELEX%3A32016L1148 https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=COM%3A2020%3A823%3AFIN https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/artificial-intelligence-cybersecurity-challenges  ENISA CYBERSECURITY MARKET ANALYSIS FRAMEWORK V2.0  Final | Version 2.0 | Public | March 2023  28  Market analysts should consider how the assets can be attacked and protected, their  robustness and resilience against an attack.  The analyst should also identify gaps in the market, where there is a need or requirement to  be filled or an opportunity to exploit.  IDENTIFY THREATS  Cybersecurity threats to the market segment include ransomware, denial of service attacks,  espionage, phishing and spear phishing, disinformation, extortion, data poisoning and many  more.  Threats come from a variety of state-sponsored and non-state-sponsored attackers, from  criminal gangs to the proverbial teenager in his/her bedroom.  Some threats are more serious than others. Spam is a nuisance, but denial of service can  shut down a service for days, weeks or months. Ransomware can result in total loss of an  organisation’s data and its business. Ransomware attacks against health services have had  huge impacts on individual patients whose records disappear into a black hole.  The market analyst should consider the types of attacks that could occur in the market  segment of interest and how well prepared, how resilient that segment is against attacks. Is  there a relatively high level of awareness of cybersecurity in the segment? Are there  incident response plans in place?  IDENTIFY REQUIREMENTS / CHALLENGES  The market analyst needs to understand the market segment’s requirements and  challenges, some of which are indicated in the following paragraphs.  When identifying requirements and challenges, the market analyst needs to consider all of  the links in the value chain or supply chain, especially where the supplier or buyer depends  on third parties from whom they buy components or to whom they wish to sell their  technology or service.  The market analyst will often ask if there are different ways of delivering or procuring a  technology or service and/or note in his or her analysis the innovations found in market  delivery.  The market analyst must assess the reliability of the supply chain and its compliance with all  relevant legislation and regulatory structures. As the Solar Winds attack in 2020 so well  showed, the analyst should also consider or evaluate the security of the supply chain and all  links in it. The market analysis should also assess the feasibility: depending on the market  segment and the type of survey (e.g., expert interviews with CEOs), such an in-depth study  is difficult to implement.  Several kinds of supply chain attacks have been identified4142, all of which involve creating  or taking advantage of security weaknesses in solutions that companies too often trust.  They include:  • Stolen certificates. If a hacker steals a certificate used to vouch for the legitimacy  or safety of a company’s product, they can peddle malicious code under the guise  of that company’s certificate.  41 ENISA, Threat Landscape for Supply Chain Attacks, https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/threat-landscape-for- supply-chain-attacks.  42 Fortinet, Supply Chain Attacks: Examples and Countermeasures,  https://www.fortinet.com/resources/cyberglossary/supply-chain-attacks.  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/threat-landscape-for-supply-chain-attacks https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/threat-landscape-for-supply-chain-attacks https://www.fortinet.com/resources/cyberglossary/supply-chain-attacks  ENISA CYBERSECURITY MARKET ANALYSIS FRAMEWORK V2.0  Final | Version 2.0 | Public | March 2023  29  • Compromised software development tools or infrastructure. Hackers leverage the  tools for building software applications to introduce security weaknesses in the  development process - even before the process is used to create an application.  • Malware preinstalled on devices. Hackers put malware on phones, USB drives,  cameras and other mobile devices, and when the target connects one of those  devices to their system or network, malicious code is introduced.  • Code included in the firmware of components. Digital hardware is controlled by  firmware that helps it run smoothly and interface with users and other systems.  Hackers can include malicious code in firmware to gain access to a system or  network.  Markets are generally not static, hence, extenuating circumstances can affect the reliability  of the supply chain. Brexit, for example, has affected thousands of companies on both sides  of the English Channel. Another example is the judgement of the European Court of Justice  curtailing the sending of European personal data for processing in the US (the “Schrems II”  judgement43).  Another element that the market analyst should consider when identifying the market and  the challenges are the pricing of the product or service, its unique selling point and the  expected uptake.  Organisations need to price their product, service or process so that they at least break  even or, better still, make a profit. Pricing is partly a matter of deciding how much the costs  of production should be reflected in each unit, how much competitors are charging for  equivalent technologies or services, how many units might be bought or sold over what  period of time. The market segment, technologies and services should have a unique selling  point (USP) – something that distinguishes them from competitors – some feature that the  market finds attractive, if not irresistible. The USP will be a factor in driving the expected  uptake.  The market analyst needs to consider how the technology or service meets a need or  requirement. The analyst should consider the benefit delivered by the technology or service  or market segment versus its affordability. No matter what the vendor’s pricing strategy  might be, if the market cannot afford the service, it will not grow. Hence, the benefit must  outweigh the cost and/or be cost saving. The analyst should factor in the point that costs  may change over time.  Knowing the competition is mostly relevant to individual companies, and this section of the  framework explains why this is important. As mentioned above, the EU Council estimates  that the cybersecurity market in Europe comprises some 60,000 companies44. Hence, there  is a highly textured market, which the analyst needs to understand. The main goals of a  competitor analysis include the following:  • Identify your strongest competitors, including competitors based outside the EU  but operating within the Union;  • Assess your competitors' strategies;  • Anticipate their actions;  • Anticipate their reactions based on the actions of your own business;  43 On 16 July 2020, the European Court of Justice issued the Schrems II judgement with significant implications for  transfer of personal data from the EU to the US. The Court affirmed that data subjects whose personal data are  transferred to a third country must be afforded a level of protection essentially equivalent to that guaranteed within the  European Union. Unless there is a valid European Commission adequacy decision, the competent supervisory  authority is required to suspend or prohibit a transfer of data to a third country. The Court ruled that the so-called EU- US Privacy Shield was invalid.

Hence,  the market analysis needs to take into account the availability of talent. The shortage of  talent has a clear impact on market growth.  An analysis of the chosen market segment must also take into account potential barriers  that could slow down or inhibit the exploitation of the market. We have indicated some  barriers above, e.g., the challenge of recruiting cybersecurity talent. Here is a list of the  most prominent barriers affecting the cybersecurity market.  Financial – Many companies – especially start-ups – are confronted by a liquidity crunch  from time to time. A recent EIB-EC report highlighted the challenges that cybersecurity start-  ups face in obtaining the financing they need to grow. The same report indicates that it is  significantly easier to raise financing in the US compared to the EU.46  Technological – Companies who have developed leading technologies or services are  sometimes in a race against time to get their products or services deployed before another  competitor comes along with a better “mousetrap”.  Regulatory – Regulatory requirements may impact the development and deployment of new  technologies or services, e.g., the GDPR’s requirement to protect personal data or the  proposed AI Act which restricts use of surveillance technologies.  Societal (including cultural and behavioural) – A significant body of public opinion may turn  against the deployment of certain technologies, e.g., facial recognition or storage of DNA.  Geographic – The deployment of some technologies may be foiled by geographic  disparities, e.g., the roll-out of fibre optical cable in rural and remote areas. But what is a  challenge for one technology may be a competitive advantage for another, e.g., satellite  terminals.  Environmental – Some technologies, e.g., blockchain, are not kind to the environment, e.g.,  they consume huge amounts of energy.  Insufficient hype – To grow, markets need promotion. However, customers and clients are  bombarded with information from many sources, hence, promotional materials may not be  enough to make much of a dent in the target market.  Staff shortages – As mentioned above, many cybersecurity companies are constrained by a  shortage of personnel and the need to pay them something approximating the salaries  offered by big foreign competitors.  Asymmetric competition – European start-ups face a formidable challenge in competing with  big, established, non-European companies.  Trust – A lack of trust can be a significant barrier especially in the (prospective) supply  chain.  45 https://www.indeed.com/career-advice/career-development/competitor-analysis  46 European Investment Bank, with contributions from the EC and ECSO, European Cybersecurity Investment  Platform, October 2022, p. 8. https://www.eib.org/attachments/lucalli/20220206-european-cybersecurity-investment- platform-en.pdf.  https://www.indeed.com/career-advice/career-development/competitor-analysis https://www.eib.org/attachments/lucalli/20220206-european-cybersecurity-investment-platform-en.pdf https://www.eib.org/attachments/lucalli/20220206-european-cybersecurity-investment-platform-en.pdf  ENISA CYBERSECURITY MARKET ANALYSIS FRAMEWORK V2.0  Final | Version 2.0 | Public | March 2023  31  Identification of existing barriers against implementing/integrating cybersecurity into systems  may be helpful for the identification of challenges (and opportunities). Such obstacles can  be technical or procedural or knowledge based, or based on missing standards.  The market analyst needs also to consider whether the market segment, technologies or  services under study are exposed to any threats or have vulnerabilities that need to be  addressed. The analyst should consider whether the market segment has any  dependencies, e.g., changes in policies or regulations or collaboration with other  stakeholders in the market.  Threats and vulnerabilities can take many forms. Security controls are measures  undertaken to mitigate the impacts and likelihood of threats to and vulnerabilities in the  assets. Mitigation measures are aimed at avoiding, minimising, eliminating, sharing or  transferring a risk.  Security requirements – the most appropriate way to express demand needs – will be  possible and efficient for analyses focussing on the value chain. Such data, however, are  usually difficult to find, especially if the market analysis scope includes stakeholders who  are reluctant to be as forthcoming as they could be.  IDENTIFY VALUE STACK ELEMENTS  Segmenting the market consists of two main steps: determining the value chain and the  corresponding value stack. The value chain is a term derived from Porter’s Value Chain47.  Investopedia describes the value chain as:  “a series of consecutive steps that go into the creation of a finished product, from its  initial design to its arrival at a customer's door. The chain identifies each step in the  process at which value is added, including the sourcing, manufacturing and marketing  stages of its production.  A company conducts a value-chain analysis by evaluating the detailed procedures  involved in each step of its business. The purpose of a value-chain analysis is to  increase production efficiency so that a company can deliver maximum value for the  least possible cost”.48  Given the technological focus of cybersecurity, we emphasise the primary value chain  elements of operations and services as well as the secondary elements of infrastructure,  technology development and procurement – i.e., the market analyst should account for all of  these elements in his or her analysis.  We can distinguish between a value chain and a supply chain. They may or may not be the  same thing. If the supply chain has some kinks, if certain companies in the supply chain are  less than reliable, it cannot be regarded as a value chain. In a value chain, every link (every  company or organisation) delivers value.  The value stack describes a collection of activities/elements contributing to an  organisation’s value production. These activities may support a product or service in fulfilling  certain standards (e.g., quality, security, compliance, etc.). The value stack follows the  structure of the cybersecurity market value stuck elements and represents a decomposition  of cybersecurity topics and technologies, services and/or processes. An example of typical  cybersecurity value stack elements and their decomposition is shown in Annex 4.  47 Porter, Michael, Competitive Advantage: Creating and Sustaining Superior Performance, Free Press, 1985.  48 https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/valuechain.asp  https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/valuechain.asp  ENISA CYBERSECURITY MARKET ANALYSIS FRAMEWORK V2.0  Final | Version 2.0 | Public | March 2023  32  IDENTIFY MARKET SEGMENT STAKEHOLDERS  Market segment stakeholders come from both the demand side and supply side. Both need  attention from the market analyst. The following paragraphs provide some guidance on  identifying those different actors. The market analyst should consider (a) the number of  people employed in the market segment, especially if the number is graphed over time, e.g.,  from now to five years in the future (such long-term forecasts however might not be easy to  make); (b) the number of companies active in the selected market segment and (c) the  number of stakeholders potentially at risk from malware or other attacks (and the probability  and impact of risk assessment). That number could initially be relatively confined but could  suddenly leap unexpectedly and highly, as happened when Stuxnet escaped into the wild,  when attackers got access to the source code and started using in their own attacks. Many  cyber attacks have hit thousands and millions of computers, especially where the attacker  has promulgated ransomware or uses a botnet in a denial of service attack.  To assess the numbers above, the market analyst should first make a list of key market  segment stakeholders across the supply chain. This list will also serve as a directory of  potential stakeholders the market analyst can target in Step 4 as part of the process of  deciding what to ask stakeholders to have a stronger, more empirical basis for analysing the  market segment.  In this step, as in all steps, the market analyst should seek validation of his or her efforts,  principally by seeking comments on the efforts from stakeholders49. If necessary, the market  analyst may want to return to Step 2 and make some revisions.  The analyst should understand, before he or she starts their work, who will be taking  decisions based on the market analysis. The decision to enter or not a particular market  segment may be taken by one senior manager or it may be a collective decision. The  organisation may have a decision hierarchy. That is, the analyst needs to refer to his or her  manager who will need to refer to a director who will need to refer to a vice president – or  some similar hierarchy of decision-making. Most likely, the market analyst will also seek the  views of key stakeholders, inside as well as outside his or her organisation.  The decision-making process starts with the initiation of the market analysis. There may be  various factors that need to be taken into account before a decision is made. The market  analyst should understand what the decision-making process will be before he or she starts  their work. The organisation undertaking the market analysis may want to circulate the draft  analysis to others to have their views before taking a decision. On the other hand, the  organisation may not want to share the market analysis with anyone outside a tight circle of  top managers for reasons of commercial sensitivity.  To help the analyst undertake the analysis, we have added some reference questions,  which are indicative only; others can be added.  Questions:  • How have you characterised the market segment? Have you done so in a  way that the non-specialist can easily grasp?  • Have you identified clearly the assets of relevance to your analysis?  • Can you specify the needs and requirements of the target market?  • What threats or factors could disrupt the market segment you are analysing?  • What security controls are or can be put in place to address perceived  threats?  • Who are the competitors in the market segment?  49 In the instance of ENISA analyses, for instance, the Agency consults widely with stakeholders (including ENISA  management and ENISA bodies), not only on the finalised market analyses, but also components thereof, such as the  scoping criteria. ENISA not only consults, but also validates its analyses with stakeholders.  ENISA CYBERSECURITY MARKET ANALYSIS FRAMEWORK V2.0  Final | Version 2.0 | Public | March 2023  33  • Where are the points of competition, e.g., a specific technology or service?  • How do competitors' value propositions differ from yours?  • How effective are their marketing campaigns and the 4 Ps: their product,  pricing, promotion and place (where they are selling)?  • Do you know who the competitors are now or might be in the coming months  or years?  • Have you delineated the barriers to enter the market?  • What is the environmental impact of the selected market segment?  • Have you described the components of the value stack and value chain of  relevance to your market analysis and any weaknesses or vulnerabilities in  either?  • Do you know who will take the ultimate decision to enter the cybersecurity  market?  • Do you know what factors the decision-maker(s) will want to know?  • Does the decision-maker have any questions beyond the details in the  market analysis to help him or her make a decision?  • Has the decision-maker had any interactions with market stakeholders who  have an (undue) influence on the decision-maker’s conclusions? For  example, well-funded big technology companies may have many times more  meetings with policymakers than civil society organisations.  • Will the public be informed about the decision-making process?  • How will the decision be announced?  • Who will make the announcement?  • When will the announcement be made?  • Are there any legal obligations with regard to the decision-making process?  • Have the criteria for making a decision been made public or, if not, does the  market analyst know those criteria?  ENISA CYBERSECURITY MARKET ANALYSIS FRAMEWORK V2.0  Final | Version 2.0 | Public | March 2023  34  STEP 4: DECIDE WHAT TO ASK  STAKEHOLDERS  Two relevant actions related to this step are:  • Identify participating market stakeholder types  • Decide on questions to ask stakeholders.  IDENTIFY PARTICIPATING MARKET STAKEHOLDER TYPES  Those interested in cybersecurity products, services and processes come from a wide  range of different stakeholder groups that can be categorised in various ways and at various  levels of granularity. At high level, the principal stakeholder groups include government,  agencies, regulators, industry, law enforcement authorities, academics, the media, civil  society organisations. Each of these categories can be examined in greater granularity. So,  for example: industry can be further subdivided into banking and finance, communications,  media and services, insurance, manufacturing and natural resources, retail, transportation,  utilities, wholesale trade, technology, etc. The cybersecurity industry comprises a wide  range of developers, integrators, service providers and trade associations among others.  Governments can be subdivided into education, healthcare, aviation, maritime, border  security, critical infrastructure protection, counter-terror intelligence, etc. Governments  include a wide range of policymakers, regulators, national authorities with cybersecurity  responsibilities, computer security incident response teams (CSIRTs) as well as relevant  experts within European institutions, bodies and agencies and their partners. Companies  can be profiled by their turnover (revenues), profitability, number of employees, ownership,  sector and location. Even internal stakeholders can be grouped, e.g., based on the structure  of the organisation.  The market analyst will have some different questions for suppliers, vendors, researchers,  developers and regulators – i.e., the questions developed for one segment may be different  from those of another segment. Some questions may be the same, but others will be  different. Different stakeholders will bring different perspectives to bear, thus, enriching the  market analysis.  Identification of market stakeholder types includes types of market stakeholder dynamics  (i.e., innovation power, quick rates, niche-product development, research-oriented, etc.).  Some examples of stakeholder types include:  • Institutional stakeholders and other stakeholders who can influence the market;  • Consumers (demand side), including procurement officials, institutions and  companies seeking cybersecurity controls against the attacks they face every day;  • Suppliers (supply side) often, but not always, companies who seek to sell their  cybersecurity products, services and processes to third parties inside and outside  the EU;  • Stakeholders who can grow the market;  • Internal stakeholders.  Institutional stakeholders and other stakeholders who can influence the  market  These stakeholders are entitled to propose ideas for priorities for the performance of  cybersecurity market analyses. They might be institutional stakeholders e.g., Member  ENISA CYBERSECURITY MARKET ANALYSIS FRAMEWORK V2.0  Final | Version 2.0 | Public | March 2023  35  States, the European Commission and other EU institutions, bodies and agencies  (EUIBAs), industrial associations and stakeholder groups.  Policymakers and regulators, for instance, can influence the cybersecurity markets by the  legislation they adopt and implement. Legislation and regulation can curtail a market, but  they can also give impetus to a market. They can force non-EU actors to comply with the  same rules as European entities. But the latter may gain at least a temporary advantage if  they already understand and comply with European legislation, such as the GDPR.  Standards bodies, such as the ISO, CEN, CENELEC, ETSI and IEEE, can influence  markets by setting standards for new technologies. For example, ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 27  addresses information security, cybersecurity and privacy protection. ISO SC 42 addresses  artificial intelligence. The market analyst might wish to join national mirror committees that  track particular ISO or CEN committees.  Consumers (demand side)  Consumers are those who might buy the product or service, who procure, or who buy a  cybersecurity solution. They create the demand. Demand volume and growth can be  analysed starting from basic financial data – how many units have been sold in the past  year and what are the expectations for the next year (and thereafter). However, depending  on the detail of the analysis (e.g., value stack), such data might be difficult to find and  collect. Hence, corresponding data sources will need to be used.  Suppliers (supply side)  Suppliers are those who can supply a cybersecurity product, service or process. This type  includes, among others, service providers, enablers, equipment providers, integrators,  vendors such as multi-domain industrial asset vendors, multi-domain vendors, single-  domain specialised vendors, single-domain specialised vendors (for more details on  vendors, see Annex 5).  The market analyst should consider the value-chain elements describing the technologies,  services and processes for each supplier type. The level of detail for the value chain will  depend on the focus of the market analysis and value stack. The analyst should map  suppliers’ role in the value chain and value stack and, having done so, create a market  guide or landscaping report, providing an overview of the principal vendors; a map defining  the market from a supply-side perspective and, as comprehensively as possible, the value  chain and value stack and vendor revenues per market segment; vendor profiles rating  them according to different methodologies, e.g., company overview and SWOT profiling;  market share, size and forecast.  Stakeholders who can grow the market  Researchers can help to grow the market segment with their work, which will contribute to  the development of new cybersecurity technologies, assessing the impact of future  technology and innovation on the relevant market segment. The analyst might wish to track  new patents and the state of the art referenced in journal articles and EU-funded projects.  Developers are instrumental in developing new technologies, services and processes.  Their innovations may have an electrifying impact on a market segment. Developers may  participate in research projects from universities, industry and governmental entities.  Investors can provide the liquidity that, especially, small companies need from time to time  to get their innovations to the market. Investors can be venture capitalists, venture angels,  banks and other lending institutions.  ENISA CYBERSECURITY MARKET ANALYSIS FRAMEWORK V2.0  Final | Version 2.0 | Public | March 2023  36  Entrepreneurs play a key role in the economy, using their skills and initiative to anticipate  needs and bring good new ideas to market. An entrepreneur is an individual who creates a  new business, bearing most of the risks and enjoying most of the rewards. The  entrepreneur is an innovator, a source of new ideas, products, services and processes.50  Internal stakeholders  Internal stakeholders come from different divisions within an organisation, e.g., senior  management team, the legal department, operations, research, finance department. Internal  stakeholders may include working groups, comprising representatives from relevant  stakeholder groups51.  DECIDE ON QUESTIONS TO ASK STAKEHOLDERS  Once the market analyst identifies the relevant stakeholder types for the chosen market  segment, he or she can prepare customised questions to ask those stakeholders52. The  analyst should be clear about what data he or she wants to gather from the stakeholders.  The analyst should consider the types of questions, e.g., avoiding open-ended question  and, instead, relying on Yes/No questions, multiple choice questions or Likert (rating) scale  questions, i.e., to make the questions easy and quick to answer. The analyst should rank  the questions in importance. The fewer the number of questions, the more responses the  analyst is likely to get. The analyst should initiate his or her questions of stakeholders by  explaining the purpose of the questions and how their responses will be used.  To develop questions to ask stakeholders, the market analyst can refer to the table with  scoping criteria (see Annex 3). For every criterion included in the scope (answered with  “yes”), the market analyst can phrase a matching question. To use the example from the  sample table in Step 2 above (see Table 2), if the scoping table criterion for the demand  side about “Required demand-side capability/maturity” was marked with “Yes”, the analysis  will focus on the capability level of the demand-side to deploy and/or manage the procured  product, service or process. The market analyst can then refer to the sub-criteria in the  table:  • Capability available: demand-side possesses necessary capabilities already;  • Capability to be developed: necessary capability is not available at demand side,  but will be developed;  • Capability outsourcing: demand side plans to outsource the capabilities needed to  deploy/maintain the product, service or process.  In our example, all three sub-criteria were marked with “yes”, so the market analyst can  phrase three questions that will produce data that covers those sub-criteria chosen for the  scope of the study. The respective questions could be the following:  • Does the demand side possess the necessary capability to deploy a given  procured product, service or process (in the chosen market segment)?  • Can the demand side develop the necessary capability to deploy a given procured  product, service or process?  • Can the demand side outsource the capability to deploy a given product, service  or process?  The first two of the three questions are dependent on the previous answers being answered  with “no”. In developing the set of questions, therefore, the market analyst must keep in  50 Adapted from https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/entrepreneur.asp.  51 For ENISA, for instance, the ENISA Management Team, the ENISA Advisory Group (AG), the ENISA Management  Team and its Ad Hoc Working Group on EU Cybersecurity Market  (https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/standards/adhoc_wg_calls/ad-hoc-working-group-on-cybersecurity-market)  52 Annex 6 contains example questions for stakeholders.  https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/entrepreneur.asp https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/standards/adhoc_wg_calls/ad-hoc-working-group-on-cybersecurity-market  ENISA CYBERSECURITY MARKET ANALYSIS FRAMEWORK V2.0  Final | Version 2.0 | Public | March 2023  37  mind the hierarchy, dependencies and order of questions, especially if created in digital  format.  When preparing the questions, the market analyst should also refer to the elements and  description of the market segment. Some resources or service models may not be present  in the scoping table, but may warrant additional investigation. The description may not be  complete or information on emerging technologies may be unavailable to the market  analyst. In these scenarios, he or she should incorporate questions not covered by the  scoping table. The scoping table is a general list of criteria that aims to set general  guidelines for cybersecurity market analyses across all market segments, but specific  market segments may require expanding the scope of the questions.  The questions are then used as the basis to collect the data. A survey can be developed  based on the questions, but other data collection tools may also be considered, including  using automated means for instance to collect (additional) data. For data collection  methods, see Step 5 below on Collect the data.  The market analyst needs to project his or her estimate of the market segment’s  deployment readiness. The analyst can assess the results from various open source  research activities (e.g., European projects, national and international research  actions/projects) in terms of their readiness and maturity levels. In doing so, he or she can  identify gaps and opportunities that might influence innovation and adoption in the market  segment. This task is highly prioritised within the EU (e.g., by the European Cybersecurity  Competence Centre, European Innovation Council, ENISA and the latter’s Research and  Innovation Team), for its actions in strengthening European research and innovation.  To help the analyst undertake the analysis, we have added some reference questions,  which are indicative only; others can be added.  Questions:  • Which stakeholder types do you plan to consult for their views on analysing  the market segment of interest?  • Have you included among the stakeholders representatives from  government, agencies, regulators, industry, law enforcement authorities,  academics, the media, civil society organisations?  • Have you included developers, integrators, service providers and/or trade  associations among others?  • Have you included among the stakeholders to consult those internal to your  organisation, e.g., those responsible for service development and offerings,  legal staff, marketing and communications experts, operations, senior  management, etc.?  • Have you planned to consult with an adequate number of stakeholders  o from the demand side?  o from the supply side?  o who can grow the market, such as researchers, developers and  investors?  • Have you thought carefully about the questions to be addressed to the  different stakeholder types to ensure their relevance? (Some questions  will be relevant for all stakeholders, others will be relevant for specific  stakeholder types, but not others.)  ENISA CYBERSECURITY MARKET ANALYSIS FRAMEWORK V2.0  Final | Version 2.0 | Public | March 2023  38  STEP 5: COLLECT THE DATA  Market analysts can gather the data they need for their analyses by a variety of means and  from a variety of sources. Surveys, interviews and focus groups are examples of primary (or  empirical) research. A literature review is an example of secondary research. Both  methods should consider the ethics and data protection aspects of data collection and  processing.  Some relevant actions related to this step are:  • Conduct primary research  • Conduct secondary research  • Take into account ethics and data protection.  CONDUCT PRIMARY RESEARCH  Primary research consists of the collection of data directly from stakeholders targeted by the  market analysis effort (i.e., relevant market stakeholder types from the relevant vertical  industry). Primary research is usually implemented through surveys, focus groups and  interviews (online, by phone or mail). If the market analyst is conducting primary research, he  or she will need to decide which tools to use. He or she will need to develop a questionnaire,  conduct the survey and analyse the results. The different tools for primary research have  some pros and cons. The tools are not mutually exclusive; in fact, they are complementary.  Surveys  If the market analyst decides to conduct a survey, he or she must be clear whom they wish  to target. Is it the public or a particular demographic or geographic area? The analyst must  decide if they can be conducted via telephone or online. The latter are significantly less  expensive. Survey questions should be tested ex ante. Surveys require a certain number of  participants for statistically meaningful results. Random surveys, e.g., responses to questions  on a website, cannot be regarded as representative. If surveys are conducted across different  Member States and translation of the questions are made, the analyst must ensure that  translations of questions agree with the source questions. Larger surveys might be  subcontracted to specialised survey agencies, holding established pools of respondents.  Interviews  The market analyst can conduct interviews in person or by phone (or communication  platforms). The advantage of interviews is that the market analyst can pick to whom he or she  chooses to talk. It also has the advantage of direct involvement in the collection, the possibility  to steer the discussion with interviewees and the ownership of the collected data. The  disadvantage is the amount of time and cost involved to conduct them, especially if they  require some travel. The market analyst should conduct at least some interviews with key  stakeholders, if for no other reason than as a reality check against data gathered from other  sources.  Focus groups  The market analyst can explore a cybersecurity market with the help of one or more focus  groups. A focus group usually comprises about 10 experts, preferably from diverse entities,  who have expert knowledge of the topic or issue at hand. A cybersecurity focus group might  bring together representatives from different stakeholder types, for instance, a cybersecurity  ENISA CYBERSECURITY MARKET ANALYSIS FRAMEWORK V2.0  Final | Version 2.0 | Public | March 2023  39  developer, a procurement department, a cybersecurity company, a public prosecutor’s office,  an academic, a civil society organisation, an enabler, such as a legal expert – or some  combination thereof. Usually, the group focuses on a limited number of questions for  discussion, lasts less than a day, tries to reach a consensus and makes some  recommendations in response to the question(s) discussed. Focus groups are good for  primary research, but are time-consuming to organise and may require payments to the  participants. A focus group requires an animator and someone to take notes. Focus groups  may be a useful complement to other data-gathering strategies. For example, focus groups  can be used to test how questions in surveys are understood. They can also be used to  discuss the results of surveys and/or interviews.  Observation  The market analyst might wish to see how consumers or other stakeholders react in particular  situations or where they are subject to the same stimuli. Market analysts have to be careful  with respect to the methodology - introducing stimuli and any elements of deception (e.g.,  untrue information) would carry a specific set of ethics and data protection concerns. Passive  observation could be the way to go, e.g., stakeholders' publicly known reactions to existing,  publicly known stimuli. Such observation could be online or in person (e.g., how data subjects  react to deepfakes). For cybersecurity research, such observation would most likely need to  be online. If the analyst is gathering personal data, he or she will need the data subject (the  person)’s consent for the observation.  CONDUCT SECONDARY RESEARCH  Secondary research is based on already existing data, including open source intelligence  (OSINT). It is usually sufficient to provide a good generic overview on market issues related  to a specific domain. It should be the principal choice in the starting phases of market  research efforts, for example, during the scoping of an analysis. The advantage of this  method is its low costs, its efficiency and ownership of collected data. A disadvantage is that  the publicly available information might be limited or inaccurate or arcane or not specific  enough regarding the vendor’s product, service or process or the buyer’s interest in knowing  who sells the products, services or processes that would fulfil their needs and requirements.  In the instance of secondary research, the market analyst will need to identify various data  sources, such as news stories, journal articles, scientific studies, “grey literature”, such as  government reports, research deliverables (e.g., from EU-funded Horizon Europe projects).  The analysts will need to extract the salient data points from his or her secondary research  and, in due course, validate his or her research outputs (the market analysis) by means of  colleagues, peers and/or stakeholders.  Online communities  Social media may offer a useful market research tool to get immediate feedback on  customers’ experiences and beliefs and to ask consumers about potential product  improvements. If your social accounts do not have hundreds of thousands (if not millions) of  followers, do not expect social media to be a viable source of market research.53 The  reliability or validity of data from social media is questionable for various reasons. Social  media users are not representative of the public as a whole. Online communities may be  subject to manipulation and disinformation.  The market analyst can research social media in several ways:  53 Beaulac, Hugh, How to Use Social Media for Market Research, CXL, 18 Feb 2019, updated 12 Mar 2021.  https://cxl.com/blog/social-media-market-research/  https://cxl.com/blog/social-media-market-research/  ENISA CYBERSECURITY MARKET ANALYSIS FRAMEWORK V2.0  Final | Version 2.0 | Public | March 2023  40  • Qualitative content analysis (number of likes/comments/shares). The number of  Likes can be a vanity metric, but assessing the engagement rate of consumers on  social media may suggest the attractiveness of a marketing message or product.  • Social listening. Passively gather feedback from your customers or monitor  opinions about your brand or competitors.  • Polls or questions. Ask questions directly in social media feeds, encouraging  users to share thoughts and feelings.54  The market analyst should consider which social media will yield the most useful results. As  one example, around 97% of B2B and B2C companies use one of the largest online  platforms. 55  Use of automated means  The use of automated means to collect and process information can be considered,  including web-crawlers and Machine Learning (ML)/Artificial Intelligence (AI) based text  analysis. For instance, ML can be used for pre-filtering large amount of web-based  information that is then reviewed by the analyst. When automatic means are used,  important related propaedeutic actions include the definition of the areas to search (e.g.  common information channels/blogs/newsfeed) and the identification of the key words to  use for the search.  Contracted market research  Research can be contracted to external market analysis companies. They provide “turnkey”  market analyses in response to market research questions. Though this method leverages  existing skills and data collection infrastructure, the market analyst or her team need to  precisely formulate the research questions and ensure that the analysis will produce the  desired results in the desired manner (i.e., report types). This can be achieved by  performing a scoping exercise, as described above. The downside of contracted research is  cost. The upside is that the cost of contracted research is sometimes shared by several  clients.  TAKE INTO ACCOUNT ETHICS AND DATA PROTECTION  When planning and executing data collection activities, the market analyst should take into  account the ethical and data protection requirements of each method of data collection.  Ethical issues include such things as respect for persons and for human dignity; fair  distribution of benefits and burden; the rights and interests of the participants; transparency  with regard to the purpose and methods of the activity; the need to ensure participants' free  informed consent (with particular attention to vulnerable categories of individuals such as  children, patients, discriminated people, minorities, persons unable to give consent, etc.),  avoidance of bias. Moreover, the methodologies used in the cybersecurity market analysis  should not result in discriminatory practices or unfair treatment. When conducting  interviews, the analyst may wish to ask the interviewee to review a written information sheet  and to sign an informed consent form (i.e., that the interviewee understands the purpose of  the interview and consents to be interviewed).  Among data protection issues with which the analyst may need to contend are the  following: the legal basis for processing; compliance with data processing principles;  pseudonymisation and where feasible, anonymisation; enabling data subject rights, e.g.,  some experts might wish for anonymity, while others are okay with attribution; repurposing  of personal data; the transfer of exports of EU data to non-EU countries; national rules on  54 Ibid.  55 Ibid.  ENISA CYBERSECURITY MARKET ANALYSIS FRAMEWORK V2.0  Final | Version 2.0 | Public | March 2023  41  cold-calling, e.g., when conducting online surveys, etc. These are just a few examples. The  GDPR is a key reference.  To help the analyst undertake the analysis, we have added some reference questions,  which are indicative only; others can be added.  Questions:  • How are you planning to collect data? Are you conducting interviews, surveys,  focus groups, etc.?  • Are you conducting a credible review of journal articles, government reports,  third-party analyses, social media, etc., for findings of relevance to the market  analysis?  • Do you expect to collect sufficient data to make a credible market analysis?  • Do you expect to be able to cite in the market analysis a credible list of sources  for your analysis?  • Are you in compliance with the relevant ethical and data protection  frameworks?  ENISA CYBERSECURITY MARKET ANALYSIS FRAMEWORK V2.0  Final | Version 2.0 | Public | March 2023  42  STEP 6: ANALYSE THE DATA  This step consists of extracting relevant and valuable information from the data collected.  The main actions in this step are:  • Process the data collected  • Identify interesting findings  • Examine contextual factors  • Identify trends  • Assess the sustainability, innovation and evolution of the market  • Compare views.  PROCESS THE DATA COLLECTED  The market analyst will need to process the data collected from various sources and in  various forms. For example, interview data will be in the form of notes or transcripts. The  output of focus groups and workshops will be reports agreed by the participants. Computers  may tabulate some or all of survey data, especially from online surveys, but some telephone  surveys may result in responses to a combination of multiple choice type questions as well  as unstructured subjective views. In other words, the market analyst may draw on  qualitative and quantitative data and need to process it to generate his or her key findings  but also to document the evidence for those key findings. The analyst will need to structure  and “clean” the data to fix or remove incorrect, corrupted, incorrectly formatted, duplicate or  incomplete data within a dataset. When combining multiple data sources, there are many  opportunities for data to be duplicated or mislabelled. If data is incorrect, outcomes and  algorithms are unreliable, even though they may look correct. The market analyst may  benefit from a template for the data cleaning process so so that he or she know they are  doing it the right way every time.56  Despite best efforts at collecting data from a variety of sources, the market analyst may still  find some holes or gaps in the data collected and in the resulting analysis. The analyst can  (perhaps) bridge the gap by making some informed assumptions or collect views of a group  of experts, e.g., in a focus group aimed at making some assumptions based on scarce  evidence.  Processing the data collected inevitably means summarising and synthesising the data so  that it is coherent and “tells a story”. For example, incident response reports should describe  how an attacker penetrated the target, the vulnerability exploited by the attacker, the  consequences and impact of the attack, the remedial measures taken or that should be  taken, who is responsible for what, etc. So: a story. Or, as another example, the market  analyst may want to know how big the potential market is for some new software for  detecting attacks somewhere in the supply chain. Hence, the analyst will need to posit the  market need and demand for such software that might open up a new, as yet non-existent  market. The market analyst may need to conduct interviews and host focus groups to get a  feel for the likely demand for the software. The analyst’s market analysis report will need to  say what data was collected, how and when it was collected, and the findings. To make the  case for developing a new market, the analyst will need tell a story, underpinned by  evidence, and when there is a lacuna in the evidence, to say what assumption led to the  conclusions.  Processing data takes time, especially if there is a serious need for cleaning. The analyst  needs to be well aware of the time and complexity of data processing. He or she should be  56 https://www.tableau.com/learn/articles/what-is-data-cleaning  https://www.tableau.com/learn/articles/what-is-data-cleaning  ENISA CYBERSECURITY MARKET ANALYSIS FRAMEWORK V2.0  Final | Version 2.0 | Public | March 2023  43  guided by five characteristics of data quality, namely: the validity, accuracy, completeness,  consistency and uniformity of the data, i.e., the degree to which the data is specified using  the same unit of measure. 57  The analyst may also consider using for the data collection some automated means such as  web-crawlers and ML/AI based text analysis, which might be useful for instance for pre-  filtering information or for identifying trend detection.  IDENTIFY INTERESTING FINDINGS  In conducting the analysis, the analyst needs to keep in mind to whom he or she is going to  send the analysis and what their expectations of the analysis might be.  The analyst should analyse the data and identify any interesting points or priorities, for  instance:  • Gaps between demand and supply  • Incentives driving market entry  • Attractiveness of market entry  • Regulatory and policy compliance  • Contextual factors  • Trends (see section on Identify Trends)  Gaps between demand and supply  Gaps between supply and demand may create opportunities, depending on which side of  the fence the market analyst stands. If demand outstrips supply for a new product, service  or process, the vendor can price his or her offering higher than in a competitive market with  alternatives. Conversely, if supply outstrips demand, the vendor may find he or she needs to  lower the price of their offering, perhaps to uneconomic levels.  The market analyst needs to consider where and why there are gaps in the market. Gaps  could appear anywhere in the supply chain. The market analyst needs to be aware that his  or her forecast could be completely undone by a failure or weakness in the supply chain,  including some stakeholder in the chain who decides to increase significantly the price of  their offering. For example, a shortage of chips may be caused by the collateral damage of  war or simply bad planning or a shortage of a precious mineral such as palladium,  manganese, cobalt or lithium used in smart phones. The analyst should contemplate how  the gap could be filled and the likely impact of the gap on the growth in the market segment.  Gaps between supply and demand may arise from the fact that a vendor may need a steady  supply of a component but may want to minimise how many such components it must carry  in its inventory versus not being able to meet the demand. In the cybersecurity sector, gaps  in supply and demand may also arise because of a shortage of talent. Thus, the analyst  should also consider the labour demands in the market segment of interest.  Incentives driving market entry  Developers and vendors of new and emerging technologies and services are driven to the  marketplace by various incentives, among which are these:  • Profit – Almost always the principal incentive;  • Transferability – Technologies developed in a government or university research  lab can be spun out to the private sector. The research for one application may be  transferred to one or more other applications;  57 Ibid.  ENISA CYBERSECURITY MARKET ANALYSIS FRAMEWORK V2.0  Final | Version 2.0 | Public | March 2023  44  • Adaptability – The technology results can be adapted across different  applications;  • Reputation – Stakeholders invest in an interesting market segment to enhance  their reputation, even if a profit is not likely in the near term;  • Caution – Many experts are concerned about the impact of quantum computing  on cybersecurity, hence, many entities – governments, universities, tech  companies – are conducting research even though the pay-off may be a decade  or more away;  • Shared interests – Stakeholders may be motivated by shared interests, like those  needed to build a 5G network or those needed to agree extended reality  standards.  The market analyst needs to specify what are the principal drivers for cybersecurity  research, innovation and exploitation in the market segment of his or her analysis. We  expect certification to be a major driver in the marketplace. For example, much of the  Cybersecurity Act is devoted to cybersecurity certification. Cybersecurity certification may  play a more important role in some domains than others.  Attractiveness of market entry  The market analyst needs to consider the costs, revenues and profits expected from the  market segment over time. The market analyst should cite the evidence for his or her  estimates and how confident he or she is in those estimates.  Regulatory and policy compliance  The market analysis should provide some contextual information on the legislative and  regulatory environment. The market analyst should alert his or her readers to the status of  prospective legislation that could have an impact on the cybersecurity market such as the  proposed AI Act or Cyber Resilience Act.  These pressures on the supply side will include compliance with the legislation such as the  EU’s General Data Protection Regulation, the Cyber Security Act, the Digital Services Act,  the Digital Markets Act, the NIS 2 directive and the e-Privacy regulation.  On the demand-side, the buyers of cybersecurity products, services or processes also face  regulatory or policy pressures, e.g., in adequately securing their network or complying with  standards.  EXAMINE CONTEXTUAL FACTORS  The market analyst should take contextual factors into account in his or her analysis. There  are two classic methodologies for identifying and analysing contextual factors. First is the  SWOT analysis focusing on the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats. Second  is the PESTLE methodology to analyse the impact of contextual factors that may be  political, economic, social, technology, legal or environmental (PESTLE) (more information  on PESTLE factors is provided below).  SWOT analysis  A SWOT analysis – which focuses on the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats  – is a widely used methodology in governmental and non-governmental institutions,  associations and the private sector. Among other things, it serves policy objectives – e.g.,  how strong is the EU in a particular market segment, where does it have opportunities to  extend its sovereignty and autonomy – as well as competitor analysis – e.g., what threats  does the EU face, where is it vulnerable. It is also a useful methodology for scoping a  market analysis, especially when it used in question mode. Below are examples of SWOT-  ENISA CYBERSECURITY MARKET ANALYSIS FRAMEWORK V2.0  Final | Version 2.0 | Public | March 2023  45  based questions for market analysis conducted by an EUIBA, an international organisation  or a European association.  Strengths  • What are the EU’s strengths in the selected market segment?  • Are there some national or EU champions in the selected market?  • How is our technology or service better than that of our competitor?  • What are the prospects for further developing our strengths in the selected  market?  Weaknesses  • What weaknesses do we (does the EU) have in the market segment?  • Does the EU / do we have some strategic vulnerabilities, i.e., our weakness in the  selected market segment has some knock-on effects in other markets?  • Will our weakness increase our dependency on non-European third parties?  Opportunities  • Do “we” see some opportunities for Europe / for our institution in developing and  deploying a new technology or service or process in the cybersecurity market?  • How is it an opportunity? Is it a gap in the marketplace worth exploring?  • Does the opportunity require some support from the EU or national governments?  • Does the opportunity come with any conditions?  • Is the opportunity one about which we can talk openly or does it require  confidentiality until the product or service is deployed?  Threats  • Does Europe / our institution face a threat in our chosen market segment? How  serious is it?  • What is the nature of the threat? Is it technological, financial, economic or other?  • Is there a perceived gap in the market that could be subject to an attack? Or is  there a gap that could be addressed with a new cybersecurity product or service?  • What is the origin of the threat?  • What can we do to mitigate the threat?  • What might happen if we don’t respond to the threat?  PESTLE factors  Market analysts typically consider multiple perspectives to gain an overview of key trends.  One of the most frequently applied measurement tools to analyse how external factors  (Political, Economic, Social, Technology, Legal, Environmental)58 affect the operations of an  organisation or a specific market segment is abbreviated PESTLE. These factors help  public and private organisations understand potential impacts, take better decisions,  allocate resources more efficiently and introduce changes to generate improvements in  impacted areas. They also help identify current and future opportunities and risks and how  to best manage them.  A PESTLE analysis typically includes the following steps:  • Identifying the key events within the six external factors;  58 Variants that build on the PEST framework include PESTLE, which puts more emphasis on the legal and  environmental factors.  ENISA CYBERSECURITY MARKET ANALYSIS FRAMEWORK V2.0  Final | Version 2.0 | Public | March 2023  46  • Analysing possible impacts on the organisation or market segment;  • Categorising opportunities and threats; and  • Tracking trends.  On this basis, organisations can develop corrective or pre-emptive strategic actions.  The political factor of the PESTLE methodology aims to assess how new government  policies and changes in legislation affect a specific market segment or an organisation’s  operations. Typical examples are tax, employment, environmental and other laws (see also  legal factors below). The political factor encompasses aspects such as the general political  climate of a country, the degree of government stability, its regulations, international  relations and posture. Terrorist attacks usually prompt demands for more surveillance and  politicians may accede to such demands even though they may know that increased  surveillance does not automatically lead to a reduction in cybercrime. An example is the  current geopolitical crisis.  The economic factor assesses the key determinants of an economy’s performance such as  inflation rates, exchange rates, cost of production, economic growth, disposable income of  consumers and the unemployment rate. These determinants may have a direct or indirect  impact on organisations and market segments, for example, a trend in a certain direction  may affect the purchasing power of consumers and could change the demand/supply  models in the economy. The economic factor can impact the way organisations price their  products, services or processes. An example of an economic or financial contextual factor is  the increasing cost of cybercrime and cyber attacks, with far-reaching costs, such as those  caused by the WannaCry ransomware in 2017 or the shutdown of the Colonial Pipeline  network in the eastern US in 2021 following a ransomware attack against the computerised  equipment managing the pipeline.  The social factor refers to the demographic characteristics, cultural attitudes and customs of  the target populations. Typically, this includes for instance the population growth rate, age  distribution, income distribution, cultural barriers and emerging lifestyle attitudes and  consciousness (e.g., environmental, privacy and health) affecting consumers’ behaviours  and preferences. An example of a social contextual factor affecting the cybersecurity market  is the public’s reaction against facial recognition in public spaces.  The technology factor pertains to innovations in technology that may affect the operations of  organisations and a specific market segment. This factor refers to technology advancement  and maturity, the emergence of disruptive technologies, the level of innovation, automation,  research and development (R&D) activity, technological change and the amount of  technological awareness that a market possesses. These factors may influence decisions to  adopt new technologies, enter or not other sectors, launch or not other products or  outsource production activities. Artificial intelligence is an example of a technology that has  had a transformative impact on the cybersecurity market. Defenders employ AI in anomaly  detection to guard against all kinds of attacks, while attackers have begun to employ AI in  viruses (Stuxnet is a classic example and one of the first of an AI-driven virus). AI is helping  defenders to speed up reaction times, when time is of the essence when the organisation is  experiencing an attack.  The legal factor concerns an organisation’s compliance with relevant laws that could affect  its position in the market. For instance, in the context of cybersecurity market analysis, the  market analyst should endeavour to analyse how changes in the data protection legislation  may impact the demand and the supply of certain products, services or processes.  The environmental factor concerns the impact on the environment of a cybersecurity  product, service or process. Often environmental factors have been overlooked. For  example, blockchain technology might be good at the confidentiality and privacy of  transactions, but it burns huge amounts of energy. Many of our infrastructures have  ENISA CYBERSECURITY MARKET ANALYSIS FRAMEWORK V2.0  Final | Version 2.0 | Public | March 2023  47  environmental impacts, such as water delivery systems and energy networks. Such  infrastructures are constantly combatting attacks with as strong cybersecurity as they can  manage. Successful cyberattacks against infrastructure may cause huge environmental  damage, e.g., disruption to water networks, oil spills or black-outs. To counter attacks,  defenders need to understand the vulnerabilities in environmental and infrastructure  networks.  IDENTIFY TRENDS  Cutting across contextual factors or even animating them are cybersecurity market trends.  They are one of the main elements to understand and estimate market developments.  Market trends emerge from a variety of factors. They may be of a generic nature or sector  specific. The relevance of market trends for a specific analysis requires a multi-level  assessment to cover these dimensions.  Market analysts can foresee trends in technology research, but environmental factors and  economic market characteristics may also help identify trends within the scope of the  cybersecurity market analysis and in the context of supply-side and demand-side research.  Market trends can be of manifold nature. Some industries –- typically with low risk –- might  need to follow technological developments. Others might orient themselves towards  changes in the threat landscape affecting their sector. In those cases, market trends can be  connected to technology foresight and threat analysis.  The maturity of particular cybersecurity markets can be analysed through the penetration of  cybersecurity products in the value chain of an organisation, the ratio of cybersecurity  spending in IT investments, the number of incidents impacting their business, level of  cybersecurity capability, etc. The maturity is indicated by the number of iterations a  technology has experienced.  In the following subsections, we provide examples of trends in the cybersecurity domain.  Rise in cybercrime and cyber attacks  Estimates of the cost of cybercrime and cyber attacks vary significantly, but all estimates  show a rise in cybercrime and cyberattacks. If the market analyst can illuminate the costs of  cybercrime and cyber attacks in the chosen market segment, so much the better. The  market analyst must make a considered judgment regarding how susceptible (or not) a new  technology or service might be to cyber attacks.  Criminals are innovators. They are interested in new technologies if they will support their  malign intents. Blockchain, for example, was helpful in disguising their transactions and,  especially, for money laundering. Criminals have played with deepfakes for advancing  pornography and social engineering. They have also begun to use artificial intelligence. The  market analyst will need to make an estimation of how criminal use of new technologies  might impact the market segment chosen for analysis.  Cybercrime as a service has also been facilitating the growth in cyber attacks, so that  anyone can get tailor-made tools and lists of potential victims at a fraction of the cost of  developing such tools themselves.  Growth in the attack surface  The Internet of Things (IoT) already numbers billions of devices in use and that number is  expected to grow rapidly in the next few years. The IoT includes the chips in your toaster,  fridge, oven and other appliances, but also the SCADA devices in critical infrastructure and  ENISA CYBERSECURITY MARKET ANALYSIS FRAMEWORK V2.0  Final | Version 2.0 | Public | March 2023  48  driverless vehicles, where the risk of manipulation keeps cybersecurity experts awake at  night. The IoT is greatly expanding the cyber attack surface.  Growth in the type of cybercriminal and cyber attacker  Not only is the attack surface growing, the range of cybercriminals and cyber attacks has  also been growing, partly because malware and the instruments for deploying it are  declining in cost and expertise.  So cybercriminals and cyber attackers range from state-sponsored attackers to attackers  who free-lance for government agencies on one day and on their own account the next.  They include organised crime gangs, like the mafia, to discontented individuals and  braggards who want to show off their expertise in taking down big companies or  government agencies.  ASSESS THE SUSTAINABILITY, INNOVATION AND EVOLUTION OF  THE MARKET  The market analyst should include in his or her analysis study some assessments or  predictions about the sustainability of the market segment and how it might evolve over the  next five years or more and what innovations might arise during that time to propel or  undermine the market. Sustainability means more than a growing number of customers: it  also means its environmental sustainability and, particularly, the UN Sustainable  Development Goals.59  COMPARE VIEWS  The analysis should highlight any views that either support or are at variance with the  analyst’s finding. He or she should bring those other views to the attention of his or her  senior managers or whoever is funding the market analysis. Views that support our market  analysis are always welcome, of course, but even other views may be welcome in showing  the need for more in-depth research. More conservative market analyses may also be  welcome in terms of injecting a note of caution into decisions to invest in or grow a particular  market. Contrary views are not always genuine; hence, the analyst should determine who  funded and sponsored contrary studies and what might have been their motive in doing so.  To help the analyst undertake the analysis, we have added some reference questions,  which are indicative only; others can be added.  Questions:  • What findings are interesting for the addressees of your analysis?  • Do the data collected show any gaps between demand and supply?  • What specific contextual factors are relevant for your market analysis?  • Which trends could affect your market forecasts, either for selling or procuring  products, services or processes?  • Have you searched whether there are other market analyses that have already  been conducted in your area of interest?  59 https://sdgs.un.org/goals  https://sdgs.un.org/goals  ENISA CYBERSECURITY MARKET ANALYSIS FRAMEWORK V2.0  Final | Version 2.0 | Public | March 2023  49  STEP 7: DISSEMINATE THE  RESULTS  The organisation conducting the analysis will decide on whether to make the market  analysis public.  The three main actions in this step are:  • Identify the tools for presenting the results  • Visualise the results with good graphics  • Assess the effectiveness of the dissemination activities.  IDENTIFY THE TOOLS FOR PRESENTING THE RESULTS  In presenting the market analysis, the analyst should consider who the decision-makers are,  who will make the ultimate decision to promulgate (or not) the results of the market analysis.  The decision-maker may have some strategic or tactical considerations of which the analyst  is unaware in the decision to promulgate those results.  The market analyst should consider how he or she should present the results of the market  analysis to the aforementioned decision-makers. There are various ways of doing so – a  report, a slide presentation, a video, a webinar, online, etc. Various tools can be employed,  none mutually exclusive.  VISUALISE THE RESULTS WITH GOOD GRAPHICS  The target audience will absorb better the findings of the market analysis if they are  presented in a visually and graphically pleasing way. No matter how great the market  analysis is, if it is not presented in a user-friendly format, and if the target stakeholders are  baffled by the results, the analysis will have been for naught. Think carefully about  visualising the results of the analysis and how to present them. Remember the adage: a  picture is worth a thousand words.  ASSESS THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE DISSEMINATION ACTIVITIES  The market analyst will want to know how colleagues, management and stakeholders have  received his or her analysis and, especially, how successful he or she has been in  disseminating the results of the analysis. As noted above, there are various tools that can  be used to disseminate the results; some will be more successful, more effective than  others. For future reference, for new market analyses, the analyst will want to learn lessons,  to learn which dissemination activities work best. The analyst should assess the  effectiveness of the various activities within a month or so of submitting his or her results  while those results are reasonably fresh in the minds of the target stakeholders.  Just as there are different means of dissemination, there are different ways of measuring  their effectiveness. For example, if the analyst’s organisation has released a press release  about the analysis, then the analyst can monitor how many news outlets (traditional media,  newspapers, magazines, websites) have picked up the press release. Publishing the press  release on the organisation’s website, the analyst can see if there have been more site  visits and click-throughs. He or she can convene a focus group to understand the views of a  cross-section of stakeholders about the analysis and how it has been presented.  ENISA CYBERSECURITY MARKET ANALYSIS FRAMEWORK V2.0  Final | Version 2.0 | Public | March 2023  50  CONCLUSIONS AND WAYS  FORWARD  In this section, we draw some brief conclusions and suggestions about the way forward.  First, this cybersecurity market analysis responds, in part, to an obligation on ENISA by the  Cybersecurity Act (CSA)60, which was referenced in the Introduction above. Art. 8 par. 7 of  the CSA says that “ENISA shall perform and disseminate regular analyses of the main  trends in the cybersecurity market on both the demand and supply sides, with a view to  fostering the cybersecurity market in the Union”. The ECSMAF provides guidance on the  things that should be taken into account in conducting cybersecurity market analyses. It  contributes to the implementation of the CSA: it supports a strong EU cybersecurity market;  it supports the regulatory oversight of the market; it supports cybersecurity certification, as  provided in the CSA. It also supports the EU’s December 2020 Cybersecurity Strategy for  the Digital Decade61.  Second, this cybersecurity market analysis framework is a guidance targeting several  different cybersecurity stakeholders, including market researchers and strategists and other  cybersecurity analysts. We have made it as readable and accessible as possible to  stakeholders.  SCENARIOS AND FORESIGHT  The analyst might wish to develop scenarios indicating technology adoption, application and  its impacts as well as its threats and opportunities. Drawing scenarios helps the analyst and  stakeholders understand the challenges facing the development of the market segment, the  requirements for mitigating risks, reducing threats relating to the deployment, operational  and societal issues of technology adoption.  The market analyst, together with colleagues and/or stakeholders, can create a scenario of  what they would like the market segment to look like in five years, for example. The  construction of the scenario (as well as the market analysis itself) can be accompanied by  other foresight techniques such as horizon scanning or Delphi exercises. Constructing a  desired, but reasonably realistic scenario, is followed by backcasting, i.e., what steps do we  need to take to arrive at the desired scenario? The market analyst should bring together a  diverse group of stakeholders to participate in the scenario construction exercise to avoid  missing any important perspectives. At the outset of that exercise, the market analyst can  present his or her findings and views of where the market segment could or should be in the  chosen time frame. The participants can express their points of view about what steps  should be taken to arrive at the desired scenario and what hurdles might have to be crossed  to get there. The market analyst should then draft the scenario based on the discussion and  then run the scenario by those participating in the exercise for their comments before  drafting a new final version reflecting those comments as well as the actions to be taken to  arrive at the desired scenario.62  60 Regulation (EU) 2019/881 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17 April 2019 on ENISA (the European  Union Agency for Cybersecurity) and on information and communications technology cybersecurity certification and  repealing Regulation (EU) No 526/2013 (Cybersecurity Act), https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal- content/EN/ALL/?uri=CELEX%3A32019R0881.  61Joint Communication to the European Parliament and the Council, The EU's Cybersecurity Strategy for the Digital  Decade, https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/ALL/?uri=JOIN:2020:18:FIN  62 There are hundreds of articles on writing scenarios. Here is one, which can be used as a guide to construction of  scenarios with increasing stakeholder consultation. Wright, David, Bernd Stahl and Tally Hatzakis, “Policy scenarios  as an instrument of policymaking”, Technological Forecasting and Social Change, Vol. 154, May 2020.  https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/technological-forecasting-and-social-change/vol/154/suppl/C.  https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/ALL/?uri=CELEX%3A32019R0881 https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/ALL/?uri=CELEX%3A32019R0881 https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/ALL/?uri=JOIN:2020:18:FIN https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/technological-forecasting-and-social-change/vol/154/suppl/C  ENISA CYBERSECURITY MARKET ANALYSIS FRAMEWORK V2.0  Final | Version 2.0 | Public | March 2023  51  A cybersecurity market analysis can benefit from scenarios and foresight, which help us  map the desired future and the ways forward (the steps) to get there. The section on  scenarios and foresight could form part of Step 7 or it could come even earlier as part of  Step 5. As we mentioned in the Introduction, the market analyst does not need to follow the  framework slavishly; he or she can pick from the detailed table of contents which bits he or  she might want to use and set aside other parts. The section on scenarios and foresight is a  case in point; the analyst might wish to engage in scenario construction and foresight as an  aide to market analysis or at the conclusion, that is, the market analysis can serve as an  input to the scenario construction.  THE WAY FORWARD  This is the second version of the framework, ECSMAF Version 2.0 (V2.0). It is an evolution  of the ECSMAF Version 1.0 (V1.0)63 with the lessons learned from the pilots, i.e. the ENISA  EU Cybersecurity Market Analysis - IoT in Distribution Grids64 and Cloud Cybersecurity  Market Analysis65.  It is entirely possible that it will be followed by subsequent versions, especially based on the  lessons learned from other pilot analyses that may be conducted in the future and if we  receive feedback from stakeholders about how we can improve it and how they can use it to  improve the EU’s position in the cybersecurity domain. Doing so is not only to vitalise the  EU cybersecurity market, but also to contribute to the EU digital sovereignty.66  To help the analyst undertake the analysis, we have added some reference questions,  which are indicative only; others can be added.  Questions:  • Which would be the best tool(s) that you have already available or you could  easily procure for presenting the results?  • Which visualisation elements can you use for presenting the results?  • Do the tool(s) and visualisation elements you intend to use have the results of  your analysis reaching the target audience?  • Have you considered constructing a scenario of where your organisation would  like to be in (say) five years?  • Have you contemplated which stakeholders you could invite to a brainstorming  session for constructing the scenario?  63 ENISA Cybersecurity Market Analysis Framework (ECSMAF) -

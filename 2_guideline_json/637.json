Security (ENISA) intends to carry out during 2016 and an associated multiannual planning for the years 2017 and 2018.  The work programme (WP) in its current state has been updated based on the feedback received from the European  Commission (EC) and the Member States (MS) in August 2015 and covers also the changes of the ad hoc group meetings  of May and September 2015. The initial draft was built on the conclusions of the ENISA strategic management board (MB)  meeting of October 2014, updated with the feedback received from permanent stakeholders group (PSG) of November  2014 and addresses the recommendations of the two ad hoc group meetings that took place in November and December,  respectively, 2014.  The multiannual planning component has been derived from the ENISA Strategy document, which has been developed  together with the ENISA MB. As such, the planning is based on four strategic objectives (SO) (which are presented in sec- tion 3.1). This approach ensures that future ENISA WPs reflect the SO of the agency.  1.1 Conventions Terms and acronyms used in this document are listed in the acronyms section.  Throughout this WP and all associated documentation, ENISA uses the phrase ‘capacity building’ to refer to those activ- ities that increase the preparedness of the relevant stakeholder communities to recognise and respond to cybersecurity  incidents. Although the ENISA regulation refers to ‘capability building’, the use of the term ‘capacity building’ is more  prevalent throughout the cybersecurity community and ENISA therefore adopts this practice. However, in no case does  the Agency use this term to cover activities that are outside the ENISA mandate.  1 Introduction  6  1 Introduc tion  1.2  Structure of this document This document is structured as follows:  •  SO and multiannual planning. The SO and multiannual planning provide the link between the ENISA strategy docu- ment and future WPs. In this section, key goals are set for each core priority for the period 2016-2018.  •  Core operational activities 2016. This section presents the core activities for 2016, which are structured around the SO  of the agency. (Budget and resources are presented at the work package (WPK) level at the end of the document.) In  addition, this section also covers the activities supporting the core operations of ENISA, such as the provision of the MB,  executive board (EB) and PSG secretariat, national liaison officers (NLOs) and European Union relations, stakeholder  communication activities, project office, data protection officer, etc.  • Administration and support department, directorate and general management activities. This section of the docu- ment summarises the activities of the Administration and support department (ASD) and the executive director (ED).  Budget and resources requirements are presented at the end of this document.  • Summary of budget and resource allocation. Budget and resources are presented at the WPK level at the end of the  document; the budget and the resource requirements for the ASD are also summarised at the end of this document.  • Annex for financing decision. The annex of this document provides a table which covers budget and resources which  are planned to be used for procurement purposes and for financing decisions.  1.3 Key goal indicators Key goal indicator (KGI) is a term that refers to pre-set indicators of process objectives (goals) that indicates what should  be achieved by a process (it defines an objective). Metrics used must be measurable. KGIs provide a measure of what has  to be accomplished in the attempt to respond to the question ‘are we doing the right things?’  While the key performance indicators (KPIs) show how well the processes work, KGIs show how well the results and goals  are being achieved.  In this WP document, the Agency proposes a number of KGIs for each WPK. Measuring the subsequent impact, however,  is a difficult and time-consuming activity, due to the fact that the impact of ENISA’s work on its stakeholder communities  is often indirect and involves a number of intermediate parties in the implementation process. This is particularly true for  those deliverables (Ds) which essentially propose recommendations to various stakeholders (these are ENISA studies).  7  Work programme 2016  v  2 Policy and legal context  ENISA situates its work in the wider context of a legal and policy environment as pointed out below. Its activities and tasks  are fulfilled as defined by its regulation and integrated in this larger legal framework and policy context (1).

planning  Strategic objectives 2016-2018  The strategic objectives (SO) originate from the ENISA strategy document.  • SO1. To develop and maintain a high level of expertise of European Union (EU) actors, taking into account evolutions  in network and information security (NIS).  • SO2. To assist the Member States (MS) and the EU institutions and bodies in enhancing capacity building throughout  the EU.  • SO3. To assist the MS and the EU institutions and bodies in developing and implementing the policies necessary to  meet the legal and regulatory requirements of network and information security.  • SO4. To enhance cooperation both between the MS of the EU and between related NIS communities.  The following sections provide high-level, multiannual planning for each of these objectives, thereby providing a basis for  the definition of future ENISA WPs.  The total cost presented in the table includes, besides the actual budget for projects, the salary costs of staff working for  the particular SO.

The SO, as mentioned in the previous section are as follows.  • SO1. To develop and maintain a high level of expertise of EU actors, taking into account evolutions in NIS. • SO2. To assist the MS and the EU institutions and bodies in enhancing capacity building throughout the EU. • SO3. To assist the MS and the EU institutions and bodies in developing and implementing the policies necessary to  meet the legal and regulatory requirements of NIS. • SO4. To enhance cooperation both between the MS of the EU and between related NIS communities.  4.1 SO1. To develop and maintain a high level of expertise of  European Union actors, taking into account evolutions in  network and information security  SO1 aims to develop and maintain a high level of expertise of EU actors, taking into account evolutions in network and in- formation security (NIS). This SO covers the threat landscape and risk assessment, including new technologies and specific  areas such as smart grids and e-health as well as information sharing and good practices and recommendations for critical  information infrastructure protection (CIIP).  4 Core operational  ac tivit ies  14  List of Work packages and short description  • WPK1.1. Improving the expertise related to critical information infrastructures  In this Work package (WPK) ENISA aims to develop good practices on emerging smart critical infrastructures (3) and servic- es. This work will provide smart critical information infrastructure and service providers and developers with good security  and resilience practices when designing, developing and deploying such services in order to minimise the exposure of  such network and services to all relevant cyberthreat categories.  • WPK1.2. NIS threats landscape analysis  Ensuring adequate levels of protection for modern IT systems in any context requires recognising and adapting to changes  in the evolving threat environment. Whilst it is clearly not possible to predict all future threats (security practices have  often been dramatically changed as a result of so called ‘black swan’ events, which are notoriously difficult to predict), it is  possible to predict the evolution of certain threats with a reasonable degree of accuracy based on past data.  ENISA can support its stakeholders by compiling existing data on threat evolution and tailoring this data to the needs of  specific stakeholder communities. The approach will be to cover threats across all sectors, whilst identifying specificities  particular to particular communities in line with the goals of the WP. This is a more scalable approach than carrying out  threat analysis directly.  • WPK1.3. Research and development, innovation  Although there is state-of-the-art research in Europe in the field of NIS, and this area is extensively supported by Euro- pean-funded programmes, research is usually not focused on the aspects where NIS policies need available technologies  to move forward on their implementation. ENISA aims in this WPK to contribute to the various consultations launched by  the Commission in the area of NIS. Such consultations may be conducted in the context of setting the research priorities  for future calls for proposals or in the context policy initiatives launched or about to be launched by the Commission.  Furthermore, during 2016 ENISA will prepare a set of recommendations on aligning research programmes with policy in  the area of NIS.  4.1.1 WPK1.1. Improving the expertise related to critical information  infrastructures  Desired impact  • By 2017, national authorities in at least five MS use ENISA’s recommendations on smart cars and intelligent road  systems.  • By 2017, national authorities in at least five MS use ENISA’s recommendations on smart health devices, services and  infrastructures.  • By 2017, national authorities in at least five MS use ENISA’s recommendations on smart airports.  Description of tasks  In this WPK ENISA aims to develop good practices on emerging smart critical infrastructures and services using the con- cept of the internet of things (IoT) to deliver new, innovative business models and services.  (3) An infrastructure can be defined as smart when investments in human and social capital and traditional (transport) and modern (ICT)  communication infrastructure support sustainable economic development and a high quality of life, with wise management of natural  resources, through participatory action and engagement.  Work programme 2016  15  The reports will provide smart critical information infrastructure and service providers and developers with good security  and resilience practices when designing, developing and deploying such services in order to minimise the exposure of  such network and services to all relevant cyberthreat categories. This builds on previous work of ENISA in the area of  smart cities (WP 2015), smart grids (WP 2012-2015) and intelligent transportation systems (WP 2015).  The main areas of work of this WPK are as follows.  • Smart cars and intelligent road systems (not including public transportation means). ENISA, in cooperation with na- tional competent authorities, will identify smart car and vehicle manufacturers and operators and will take stock  of cybersecurity risks and challenges introduced by the use of IoT. The Agency will then develop good practices for  private and public stakeholders (e.g. national competent authorities).  • Smart health services and infrastructures. ENISA will identify e-health critical service providers (e.g. hospitals,  e-health cloud providers, insurance companies, smart laboratories) and will take stock of major cybersecurity risks  and challenges introduced by the use of IoT. The Agency will then develop good practices for both private as well as  public stakeholders (e.g. national competent authorities).  • Smart airports including supply chain integrity. ENISA will identify major airports that develop and operate smart ser- vices and take stock of the security challenges arising from the usage of these services. The Agency will then develop  good practices for airports and relevant public authorities that address these challenges.  • These emerging areas are selected based on their criticality for citizens and the economy. The Agency expects these  particular sectors and services to benefit the most from the wide adoption of IoT and machine to machine (M2M)  technologies. The early adoption of these good practices will boost trust and confidence of potential users of such  infrastructures and pave the way for the wide deployment of them. In this way ENISA will help EU industry to become  more competitive and innovative.  For each area ENISA will identify all relevant public and private stakeholders, engage them in working groups and jointly  take stock of and analyse the current situation in terms of cybersecurity and resilience giving emphasis on communication  security. The Agency will also identify EU and national-funded projects in the area of IoT and M2M communication, liaise  with them, analyse their findings and deliverables, and further engage them in corresponding expert groups. Special em- phasis will be given to the resilience and robustness of such smart critical information infrastructure and services.  Based on the consultation with stakeholders and desktop analysis and research, ENISA will develop good practices and  propose baseline security requirements targeted at EU and national policymakers, operators and manufacturers.  Outcomes and deadlines  D1: Good practices on the security and resilience of smart cars and intelligent road systems (report and a workshop, Q4,  2016). D2: Good practices on the security and resilience of smart health services and infrastructures (report and a workshop, Q4,  2016). D3: Good practices on the security and resilience of smart airports (report and a workshop, Q4, 2016).  Stakeholder impact  • Identify NIS issues and challenges in the areas mentioned above. • Develop good practices that stakeholders could use to either improve their current operations or develop more se-  cure systems and services. • Issue-targeted recommendations to policymakers and MS and work with them to address them in the most practical  and cost-effective way.  4 Core operational  ac tivit ies  16  Legal base and policy context  • ENISA regulation Article 3, in particular 3.1(c) (ii) and (iii) on promoting and sharing best practice, Article 3.4 on inde- pendent conclusions, guidance and advice.  • CIIP action plan 2009 and 2011. • Digital agenda 2010. • European strategy for cybersecurity. • Cloud computing strategy. • Council Resolution of 18 December 2009 on a collaborative European approach to network and information security  (2009/C 321/01). • Internal security strategy for the European Union. • Commission communication — ‘Smart grids: from innovation to deployment’, COM(2011) 202 final of 12 April 2011. • EC Recommendations on preparations for the roll-out of smart metering systems.  4.1.2 WPK1.2. Network and information security threats landscape analysis  Desired impact  • In 2016 at least 15 companies and five Member States participate in the ENISA stakeholder groups established to  perform the work.  • By 2017 produced results are referenced by at least 500 stakeholders in the area of threat/risk assessment. • By 2017 produced results are downloaded by at least 10 000 individuals.  Description of tasks  Objectives:  • To develop the current cyberthreat landscape. • Collect, collate and analyse existing publicly available material on threats, risks, trends and emerging technologies  application areas. • Build synergies with and seeking input from the computer emergency response team for the EU institutions, bodies  and agencies (CERT-EU), EU institutions, national bodies, industry and agencies. • Liaise with experts/organisations to conduct detailed threat assessments in specific sectors/areas. Deliver informa-  tion that can be fed to other upcoming initiatives, for example in the areas of research, standardisation, etc. • Further enhance ENISA capabilities in information collection, analysis and dissemination by adopting practices that  are (partially) tool-based. This will allow ENISA to import/export available data. • Achieve a more complete coverage of the threat analysis life-cycle by adding additional elements such as attack vec-  tors or classification schemes for cyberthreats (i.e. taxonomies). • Develop practical, scenario-based advice on how threat information can flow into risk assessments.  The main goal of this WPK is to provide a comprehensive compilation of cyberthreats based on publicly available infor- mation. This is being done by means of top threats that are assessed by analysing collected information. Threat informa- tion contains strategic and tactical information on threats and it gives references to detailed documents describing the  cyberthreat. Moreover, it provides information on threat agents. Threat information is then extrapolated to emerging  technology areas. Based on some assessed/assumed vulnerabilities in those areas, we provide possible threat exposure  data for those areas.  Another module within this WPK is the performance of dedicated assessments in some areas of particular interest to our  stakeholders, usually with an emerging character. In the past years, for example, ENISA has performed assessments in the  areas of smart grids, smart homes and internet infrastructure. With this kind of work we show the exposure of assets from  one sector to cyberthreats. We then analyse existing good practices and show how this exposure can be reduced, while  we identify gaps in existing practices.  Work programme 2016  17  All the types of information provided aim to support decision-makers in all kind of organisations to understand the threat  landscape and to make informed decisions regarding cybersecurity. Another target group are security professionals who  wish to be informed about the threat landscape and who are interested in having a neutral yet comprehensive list of cy- berthreats together with relevant publications/resources.  In 2016, ENISA would like to expand the scope of the threat landscape to include information on attack vectors and also to  provide useful information on various classification schemes for threat-related information (taxonomies). Moreover, ENI- SA would like to provide information on how cyberthreats target assets and what practices are available to protect these  assets. This information will be derived from the specific sector assessments and other relevant ENISA activities and will  be made public to interested organisations/individuals. Finally, more effective dissemination methods, eventually using  a specialised web portal will be accounted for.  Outcomes and deadlines  Based on the tasks described above, the following outcomes and deliverables are envisaged.  D1: Annual threat analysis/landscape report (Q4, 2016). D2: Assessments on two key technology/application areas (governments, small to medium‑sized enterprises (SMEs), etc.)  (Q4, 2016).  Stakeholder impact  The ENISA threat landscape is a document used by Member States and security experts worldwide to assess their expo- sure to threats and/or risks.  The primary beneficiaries of this WPK will be policymakers, organisations from the public and private sectors, but also NIS  security experts who will receive integrated and consolidated information about the European NIS threat landscape and  how it is evolving.  • Public and private organisations: other MS agencies, EC3, various governmental agencies. • EU Commission: Directorate-General (DG) Communications Networks, Content and Technology, DG Informatics and  DG Internal market, Industry, Entrepreneurhip and SMEs. • NIS experts: various experts willing to receive consolidated information about cyberthreats, cyberthreat agents, at-  tack patterns and emerging trends. • Power users, SMEs.  Public and private organisations may capitalise on the ENISA output to propose innovative R & D activities, input ENISA  information into their own decision support and assessment processes. This will facilitate the development of secure  products or services.  Detailed assessments help organisations to understand threat exposure within a specific sector/area. Moreover, it pro- vides information on available good practices to mitigate resulting risks.  Legal base and policy context  • ENISA regulation, Article 3, particularly 3.1(b)(i) and 3.1(c)(v). • The cybersecurity strategy of the EU. • The proposal for NIS directive and digital agenda.  4 Core operational  ac tivit ies  18  4.1.3 WPK1.3. Research and development, innovation  Desired impact  • At least 10 experts from the community to participate in the validation of the results of the studies. • At least five independent high-level experts from the cryptography field to participate in the quality review and the  panel for the cryptographic challenges. • At least 50 individuals/teams participate in the cryptographic challenges. • At least six research experts and networking experts from industry to contribute to the study on security aspects of  virtualisation.  Description of tasks  ENISA will launch in 2016 a new activity, the cryptographic challenges, where the Agency will present to the public a set  of cryptographic problems which can be solved by applying cryptanalysis techniques and analytical skills. The aim of this  activity is to increase the interest and outreach of cryptography research in Europe, at all educational levels, by providing  incentives in this area. The winner of each challenge will be the first contestant(s) to submit the correct solution to ENISA  and will be awarded a symbolic prize by the Agency.  In order to ensure the quality of the questions, as well as the appeal to the audience, ENISA will be supported in the elab- oration of the different challenges by renowned cryptographers, who will also take part in the panel assessing the correct- ness of the responses. In addition, and with the goal of expanding the target audience, the challenges will be divided into  several categories with different levels of difficulty, aimed at secondary students, university graduates and cryptography  researchers and practitioners. Participation will be open to any individual or team across Europe.  As was the case in previous years, ENISA will continue to support the Commission by providing experts in the evaluations  of the calls for proposals which are published in the context of EU-funded R & D programmes. In this context, emphasis  will be given to the areas which are important to the ENISA WP as presented in this document. It should be envisaged that  ENISA may contribute up to two experts for the evaluation of calls for proposals during 2016.  Work programme 2016  19  Additionally, ENISA will prepare a set of recommendations in 2016 on aligning research programmes with policy in the  specialised area of NIS. Although there is state-of-the-art research in Europe in the field of NIS, and this area is exten- sively supported by European-funded programmes, research is usually not focused on the aspects where NIS policies  need available technologies to move forward on their implementation. ENISA will address both the research and policy  communities in order to find means to improve coordination and to facilitate good support for policy areas that rely on  a technological base.  Finally, in the context of the ENISA activities supporting research and innovation in security topics, the agency will tackle  the subject of virtualisation in 2016. Virtualisation is a concept where there is an abstraction of the physical layers of  information and communications technology (ICT) components and virtual versions are created in logical layers. It can be  applied to hardware, operating systems, data, networks, etc. One of the concerns regarding virtualisation is its security  aspects, namely if vulnerabilities could lead to a breach in the logical separation of components. However, virtualisation  is reaching a very high deployment rate nowadays; therefore more research should be done on how virtualisation can be  implemented with adequate levels of security.  In order to support the R & D in this area, ENISA will prepare a study on the security aspects of virtualisation. The study will  analyse virtualisation from an ample perspective: hardware virtualisation (local virtual machines), desktop virtualisation  (thin clients), application virtualisation (remote desktop services), etc. The report will collect existing work on this area,  propose security best practices and identify gaps that need to be covered by further research. Furthermore, the study will  focus on best practices on how to provide security by default to virtualised systems by addressing possible risk scenarios  for these kind of architectures. This will support the decision-making process regarding how to optimise the cost of im- plementing virtualised systems.  Outcomes and deadlines  Based on the tasks described above, the following outcomes and deliverables are envisaged  D1: ENISA cryptographic challenges (Q3, 2016). D2: Recommendations on aligning research programme with policy in the specialised area of NIS (Q4, 2016). D3: Study on security aspects of virtualisation (Q4, 2016).  Stakeholder impact  The direct beneficiaries of the results of this WPK will be the policymakers, framework programmes of EU-funded R & D,  standardisation bodies and the end-user organisations from public and private sectors, in particular in the areas listed  below.  • Standardisation related to NIS, privacy, cloud computing and smart grids. • Harmonisation of EU-funded research and policy initiatives. • Academic and industry research in networking innovations.  Legal base and policy context  • ENISA regulation, Article 3, particularly 3.1(d)(ii). • Council Resolution of 18 December 2009 on a collaborative European approach to network and information security  (2009/C 321/01). • European Committee for Standardisation (CEN)/European Committee for Electrotechnical Standardisation (Cene-  lec)/European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) CEN-Cenelec cybersecurity coordination group (CSCG)  White Paper No 01 Recommendations for a strategy on European cybersecurity standardisation.  4 Core operational  ac tivit ies  20  4.2 SO2. To assist the Member States and the European Union  institutions and bodies in enhancing capacity building  throughout the European Union  SO2 is designed to provide assistance to MS and EU institutions and bodies, as well as the private sector by supporting NIS  enhancement of capacity building through the EU. ENISA will work together with Member States and EU institutions to  assist them in capacity building across the EU. In particular, the Agency will work together with all relevant stakeholders  to ensure that the approach is coherent across the EU.  List of work packages and short description  • WPK2.1. Assist Member States’ capacity building  One of the main goals of this work package (WPK) is to develop and improve the activities related to the operational  security support programme. In 2016, ENISA will build upon its work in the operational security area, and will update the  impact assessment related to this area to concisely draw ‘lessons learned’ via a dialogue with relevant stakeholders, and  to adjust the activities for the coming years.  Another main goal of this WPK is to help the EU Member States and other ENISA stakeholders, such as the EU institutions,  bodies and agencies, to develop and extend the necessary capabilities in order to meet the ever-growing challenges to  secure their networks.  • WPK2.2. Support EU institutions’ capacity building  In this WPK ENISA aims to enhance the dialogue among EU institutions and support them in reinforcing their NIS capacity  building. The Agency will also improve the mechanism to provide key stakeholders with timely and high-quality responses  to NIS developments.  • WPK2.3. Assist private sector capacity building  One of the main obstacles for the implementation of wide and effective cybersecurity programmes in organisations is the  lack of a common language among managers and technical staff, which makes it difficult for the latter to transmit the cur- rent security scenario to the former. ENISA will look at best practices in Member States on how to reach the private sector  in order to increase cybersecurity awareness and skills; as well as to promote a culture of cybersecurity.  The agency will gather information on successful experiences conducted in MS directed specifically to the private sector  such as awareness campaigns, reference materials, web portals, etc.  • WPK2.4. Assist in improving the general awareness  Building on the work of WP 2015, in 2016 ENISA will move towards the implementation of the 2015 recommendations to  address opportunities for the distance-learning delivery of NIS modules to large audiences. The approach under this WPK  is to leverage existing material (courses) instead of developing new material (which is outside the scope and resources of  the Agency.  In recent years, the European Cyber Security Month (ECSM) has expanded its outreach with numerous activities in the  Member States, reaching a large number of European citizens. ENISA will continue to coordinate the ECSM in 2016.  Additionally, and in order to promote capacity building among the security community, ENISA will launch a competition  in 2016, in the form a ‘capture the flag’ challenge, named the ‘ENISA cyber challenge’. Its goal is to increase the interest  in NIS by promoting excellence in the form of competitions, as well as to gather feedback on the areas of interest for the  communities.  Work programme 2016  21  4.2.1 WPK2.1. Assist Member States’ capacity building  4.2.1.1 WPK2.1.A. Assistance in the area of operational security and NIS operational training  Desired impact  • Internal timely preparation for the upcoming activities (2017 and beyond) in the operational security support  programme.  • Support Member States in enhancing their national and governmental CSIRT baseline capabilities. • Continued CSIRT services training will be provided to a minimum of 20 participants of different organisations in five  Member States. • Improved operational practices of CSIRTs in at least 15 Member States (ongoing support with best practices  development).  Description of tasks  Objectives  • Facilitate voluntary information sharing techniques to enhance quality of collection. • Extend mutual interactions with stakeholders in MS-wide area for incident response collaboration. • Build upon successful work in the area of ‘training methodologies and impact assessment’. • Update training material for operational communities (e.g. CSIRTs). • Develop new sets of training for NIS. • Further develop and apply ENISA recommendations for baseline capabilities. • Provide technical training for MS and EU bodies.  One of the main goals of this WPK is to perform sustainable research, development and improvement of activities related  to the multiannual development for the operational security support programme.  In 2016, ENISA will build upon its work in operational security areas, it will update the impact assessment report and  adjust the roadmap from 2014. The goal is to concisely draw ‘lessons learned’ via a dialogue with relevant stakeholders,  and to adjust the roadmap of CSIRT activities for the coming years. This approach will also apply for other leader activities  of the operational community support programme (training methodologies, baseline capabilities, operational community  development, etc.).  Another main goal of this WPK is to help the EU Member States and other ENISA stakeholders, such as the EU institutions,  bodies and agencies, to develop and extend the necessary capabilities in order to meet the ever-growing challenges to  secure their networks.  Most of the activities in this WPK target maintaining and extending the collection of good practice guidelines in various  areas of operational-capability building. In addition, ENISA will continue supporting Member States in enhancing their  national and governmental CSIRT capabilities.  A special emphasis in this WPK is put on supporting operational bodies and communities (namely CSIRTs, but other com- munities where appropriate) via concrete advice (such as good practice material) and concrete actions (such as CSIRT  training).  Outcomes and deadlines  Based on the tasks described above, the following outcomes and deliverables are envisaged:  D1: Updated impact assessment/adjustment of roadmap from 2015 (Q4, 2016). D2: Follow‑up/extension of the training methodologies work from 2014/15 (Q4, 2016). D3: Update of existing training material (Q4, 2016). D4: Development of a set of new training material (Q4, 2016).  4 Core operational  ac tivit ies  22  D5: On‑request training for MS and EU bodies (Q4, 2016). D6: Good practice in incident tracking and taxonomy (Q4, 2016). D7: Annual update of baseline capabilities (report) (Q4, 2016).  Stakeholder impact  • The Commission will obtain insight and expert opinion for current and future policy efforts in the incident response  field.  • The agency will obtain insight and input for future actions for operational community programme. • Beneficiaries of this WPK will be the organisations and institutions responsible for cybersecurity incident response  in both the public and private sectors; they will be able to obtain consolidated good practice material and training  information or on-site training for cybersecurity operations.  Legal base and policy context  • ENISA regulation, Article 3, particularly 3.1.(b) and 3.1.(c). • Proposed NIS directive.  4.2.1.2 WPK2.1.B. Assistance in the area of cybersecurity strategies  Desired impact  • By 2017, 10 Member State use ENISA’s good practices on NCSS. • By 2017, 15 private organisations use ENISA’s good practices on NCSS. • By 2017, 10 Member State use ENISA’s good practices on national public–private partnerships (PPPs). • By 2017, 15 private organisations use ENISA’s good practices on national PPPs.  Description of tasks  This work package aims to help the EU MS and other ENISA stakeholders, such as the EU bodies, to develop and extend the  necessary capabilities in order to meet the ever-growing challenges of securing their networks, services and information  infrastructures.  ENISA will continue assisting EU MS to develop their capabilities in the area of NCSS. The Agency, building on previous  years’ work in this area, will assist MS to deploy its existing good practices in this area and offer targeted and focused  assistance on specific aspects of NCSS (e.g. on the evaluation of NCSS).  ENISA will also act as a facilitator in this process by bringing together MS and the private sector with varying degrees of  experience to discuss and exchange good practices, share lessons learned and identify challenges and possible solutions.  Through this interaction with the MS, ENISA will validate and update its existing NCSS good practice guide and the evalu- ation/assessment framework of NCSS.  In the area of cloud computing for e-government applications and services, ENISA will assist central and/or local govern- ments to develop their capabilities. The Agency will bring together MS with varying degrees of experience and knowledge  on cloud computing and will discuss with them the benefits, risks and challenges arising from the deployment of this  technology. Through this interaction ENISA will also be able to assist the MS in properly addressing NIS matters when they  deploy cloud computing by using the existing ENISA good practice guide and security framework.

Assistance in the area of privacy and trust  Desired impact  • At least five data protection authorities (DPA) and 10 large EU data controllers to use the personal data breaches  severity assessment tool.  Description of tasks  ENISA will support Member States in their own decision-making process, by providing advice and referencing the appro- priate ENISA studies in the area of privacy and trust. This will be done on an on-demand basis. The agency will focus on  providing appropriate tools that facilitate Member State implementation of the provisions set out in the trust Services  regulation and the proposed data protection regulation. These activities will be conducted, as in previous years, in close  collaboration with the supervisory bodies of the MS  Specifically, in the area of personal data breaches, ENISA will continue to enhance and promote the adoption of the data  breach severity assessment tool the Agency developed in 2015. This tool, which has been implemented in close collabora- tion with several Member State DPAs, aims to provide a coherent framework for assessing data breach severity across EU  MS. In 2016, ENISA will continue to support DPAs to adopt the proposed tool and to perform impact assessment exercises  on various breach scenarios.  4 Core operational  ac tivit ies  24  Outcomes and deadlines  Based on the tasks described above, the following outcomes and deliverables are envisaged.  D11: On‑request support for MS decision‑making in the areas of privacy and trust (Q4, 2016).  Stakeholder impact  The direct beneficiaries of the results of this work will be the MS DPA and Article 29 Working Party, which will receive ad- vice and a series of proposed tools aimed to support them in the implementation of the European regulations in the areas  of privacy and trust. These activities will also facilitate the harmonised adoption of the European regulatory framework  in these fields.  Legal base and policy context  • ENISA regulation, Article 3, particularly 3.1.(b).(i) and 3.1.(c).(v). • Cybersecurity strategy of the European Union. • Data protection directive 95/46/EC. • Commission Regulation (EU) No 611/2013 of 24 June 2013 on the measures applicable to the notification of personal  data breaches under Directive 2002/58/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council on privacy and electronic  communications.  • Proposal for a general data protection regulation.  4.2.2 WPK2.2. Support European Union institutions’ capacity building  4.2.2.1 WPK2.2.A. Information notes on NIS: production and review mechanisms (‘info notes’)  Desired impact  • In 2017 improve information flows regarding NIS issues between the EU institutions. • In 2017 improved mechanism for producing and distributing of info notes. • At least two EU bodies and five public stakeholders will receive the timely information on NIS incidents and significant  developments in the field.  Description of tasks  Objectives  • Improve the mechanism that will allow the Agency to provide timely and high-quality responses to NIS developments. • Timely information provided to key stakeholders on NIS incidents and on significant developments in the field.  In the case of NIS issues and occurrences that reach a certain level of public and media attention it is crucial that the  Agency, where appropriate in collaboration with EU institutions and bodies, e.g. CERT-EU, provide a more balanced set  of information about the issues and occurrences. This is why ENISA will continue to provide high-quality responses to NIS  developments. Based on the practice and experience in 2014 and 2015, the Agency will review and adjust the mechanism  for preparing and producing info notes.  ENISA’s intention is to continue providing info notes in a timely manner as a reliable and continuous service to its stake- holders. The overall goal for each note should be to highlight fundamental facts and the shortcomings behind specific NIS  issues and occurrences, concentrating on how such shortcomings can be addressed by improvements to processes and  infrastructure, in order to give advice to its key stakeholders (in accordance with the Agency mandate) and to provide an  independent and ‘calm’ opinion. Notes will only be made public if the topic is not an ongoing incident, and if the note is  based on public information.  Work programme 2016  25  Outcomes and deadlines  Based on the tasks described above, the following outcomes and deliverables are envisaged.  D1: Review and adjust mechanism for production of info notes (Q1‑4, 2016). D2: Restricted and public info notes on NIS (Q1‑Q4, 2016).  Stakeholder impact  • Improved collaboration with EU bodies (e.g. CERT-EU) concerning timely and high-quality info notes on NIS incidents  and significant developments in the field.  • Timely information provided to key stakeholders on NIS incidents and on significant developments in the field.  Legal base and policy context  • ENISA regulation, Article 3, particularly 3.1(b) and 3.1(c).  4.2.2.2 WPK.2.2.B. Reinforcement of the NIS of Union institutions, bodies and agencies  Desired impact  • ENISA’s expertise regarding the MS NIS capacity development is also to be offered to EU institutions, agencies and  bodies (hereinafter: ‘EU institutions’), in cooperation with CERT-EU.  • Enhanced knowledge of EU institutions regulations, policies, procedures related to their NIS. • Identification of well-functioning practices that could be disseminated to all or relevant EU institutions, as well as  information concerning critical weaknesses that should be addressed. • Identification of future actions that ENISA could initiate in order to further reinforce the NIS of EU institutions.  4 Core operational  ac tivit ies  26  Description of tasks  In this WPK ENISA aims to enhance the dialogue among European institutions and support them in reinforcing their NIS.  In 2016, concrete actions are planned.  • Identifying and liaising with all relevant stakeholders within European institutions and bodies. • In cooperation with all relevant European institutions and bodies, taking stock of and initiating an analysis of all exist-  ing regulations, policies, procedures and practices of all EU institutions related to their NIS.  Through stocktaking and analysis, ENISA will identify overlaps and gaps between all these regulations and policies. These  findings could also be discussed with all relevant stakeholders from EU bodies, EU MS and even the private sector. That  might pave the way for a permanent strategic dialogue among all European institutions and bodies on the future of NIS  policy in the EU.  This dialogue will result in important recommendations that would allow the simplification of policies, reduction of over- laps, identification of synergies, creation of awareness about NIS challenges and even proposals for new actions to ad- dress identified gaps. That would help European institutions and bodies to better focus their efforts and properly use their  resources to meet the needs of EU MS and the private sector. ENISA is liaising and will continue to liaise, for this purpose  with CERT-EU, the incident response team for the EU institutions. The expertise of CERT-EU on the reactive dimension of  NIS of the EU Institutions will strongly benefit this process.  Considering the sensitiveness of the information that ENISA might be provided with by European institutions, deliverables  will be restricted in distribution.  Building on this work ENISA will address in future work programmes the setting up of a European institution NIS contin- gency plan, the organisation of dedicated EU institution cyber incidents exercises, and the launch of awareness-raising  initiatives.  Outcomes and deadlines  Based on the tasks described above, the following outcomes and deliverables are envisaged.  D3: Restricted. Upon request, support the assessment of existing policies/procedures/practices on NIS within EU institu‑ tions (workshop, meetings, Q1‑4, 2016).  Stakeholder impact  Dialogue among EU institutions on their NIS will be facilitated. EU institutions and bodies will:  • further benefit from each other’s best practices on NIS. • obtain insight and expert advice on how to reinforce their NIS. • benefit from the establishment of cooperation between CERT-EU and ENISA. • obtain insight and expert opinion on NIS field. • better understand the synergies between existing policies, regulations and procedures. • better understand the overlaps between existing policies, regulations and procedures. • better understand how to address gaps in existing policies, regulations and procedures.  Legal base and policy context  • According to Article 3(b)iii of ENISA’s 2013 regulation, the Agency shall […] assist the EU institutions, bodies, offices  and agencies in their efforts to develop the prevention, detection and analysis of and the capability to respond to  NIS problems and incidents, in particular by supporting the operation of a computer emergency response team […]  for them.  Work programme 2016  27  • In its conclusions on the European cybersecurity strategy (11357/13 of 21 June 2013), the Council called upon all EU  institutions, in cooperation with ENISA, to take the necessary actions to ensure their own cybersecurity, by reinforc- ing their NIS according to the appropriate standards.  4.2.3 WPK2.3. Assist private sector capacity building  Desired impact  • At least five MS and five private sector stakeholders contribute to the production of the guidelines for MS to reach  the private sector through cybersecurity awareness dissemination activities.  • At least 15 private sector stakeholders coming from different MS, sectors of activity and size participate in the elabo- ration of the recommendations for ICT security staff on improving management level cybersecurity awareness.  Description of tasks  ENISA will look at best practices in Member States on how to reach the private sector in order to increase cybersecurity  awareness and skills; as well as to promote a culture of cybersecurity. The agency will gather information on successful  experiences conducted in MS such as awareness campaigns, reference materials, web portals, etc.  The agency will focus on recommendations on how to improve cybersecurity awareness at the management level. Indeed,  one of the main obstacles for the implementation of wide and effective cybersecurity programmes in organisations is that  there is a lack of a common language among managers and technical staff, which makes it difficult for the latter to transmit  the current security scenario to the former.  The report will analyse how to tackle and overcome this culture dialogue issue. By taking stock from existing guidelines  in Member States and international security organisations, the agency will try to support security managers and profes- sionals with references to existing guidelines on how to engage the senior level support for cybersecurity. The agency will  propose best practices focusing exclusively in areas where existing gaps in reference materials have been detected.  Outcomes and deadlines  Based on the tasks described above, the following outcomes and deliverables are envisaged.  D1: Recommendations for creating a cybersecurity culture and improving management‑level cybersecurity awareness  (Q4, 2016).  Stakeholder impact  • The direct beneficiaries of the results of this work will be MS and EU companies, from all sectors and sizes, which will  receive recommendations on how to improve cybersecurity awareness and create a cybersecurity culture, especially  from an organisational level and managerial level.  Legal base and policy context  • ENISA regulation, Article 3, particularly 3.1(c)(iv) and 3.1(c)(v). • ENISA stakeholder strategy. • Cybersecurity strategy of the European Union (section 2.1). • Commission communication — ‘A digital agenda for Europe’, COM(2010) 245 final of 19 May 2010.  4 Core operational  ac tivit ies  28  4.2.4 WPK2.4. Assist in improving general awareness  Desired impact  • Further develop an effective work process to involve more universities and certification providers. • At least 50 individuals from MS participate in the ENISA cyber challenge. • Representatives from the EU 28 MS and five partner countries participate in ECSM and the release of general NIS  messages for citizens. • At least five international stakeholders collaborate, for better coordination, in the ECSM. • At least 10 experts from the community participate in reviewing the contents of the citizens’ portal.  Description of tasks  The Agency published in 2014 a report Roadmap for NIS education programmes in Europe and one of the recommenda- tion stated the following; massive online open courses (MOOCs) may offer opportunities for the distance learning delivery  of NIS modules to large audiences. Building on the work of WP 2015 this year ENISA will move towards the implementa- tion of the 2015 recommendations. It is of worth to note that also in this case the approach under this WPK is to leverage  existing material (courses) instead of developing new material (which is outside the scope and resources of the Agency. It  is within the scope of the work on NIS education and it fully involves the organisations from Member States which already  developed a MOOC and would like to further share their work with the community.  Additionally, and in order to promote capacity building among the security community, in 2016 ENISA will launch a com- petition in the form a ‘capture the flag’ challenge, named ‘ENISA cyber challenge’. It will be aimed at university students  from technical schools and security practitioners from the industry. Its goal will be to increase the interest in NIS in these  communities by promoting excellence in the form of competitions, as well as to gather feedback on the areas of interest  for the communities. In order to do so, ENISA will try to achieve large participation among individuals from different MS.  As one of its main activities in the area of improving public awareness, ENISA will continue to coordinate the ECSM. In re- cent years, the ECSM has expanded its outreach with numerous activities in the Member States, reaching a large number  of European citizens. In 2016, the ECSM will be further developed following its basic principles, namely:  • support the multi-stakeholder governance approach, • encourage common public-private activities, • assess the impact of activities, optimising and adapting to new challenges.  In addition, ENISA conducted in 2015 a feasibility study and a pilot project for a web portal that allows European citizens  to recognise and use tools for online privacy and security. In particular, the portal lists existing up-to-date and trustworthy  open source/freeware tools that can be easily applied by non-expert users who wishes to protect themselves online (e.g.  in web browsing, email, instant messaging, e-payment systems). To ensure a neutral perspective, tools are selected after  the review of an independent panel of experts.  In 2016, ENISA aims to promote the use of technical tools that enhance user privacy and data protection. It does so by  publishing relevant content, focusing on specific citizens groups, as well as disseminating relevant information through  community portals and online media in order to reach out to more parties. Moreover, effort will be put into supporting  users in recognising and selecting privacy tools in cooperation with other relevant stakeholders (DPA, industry, non-gov- ernmental organisations (NGOs), etc.).  Outcomes and deadlines  Based on the tasks described above, the following outcomes and deliverables are envisaged.  D1: ENISA report on ‘massive open online courses (MOOCs) for NIS needs’ (Q4, 2016). D2: ENISA cyber challenge (Q2, 2016). D3: Provide guidance and support for ECSM (dissemination material, Q4, 2016). D4: Upgrade the online privacy tools portal and involve privacy experts from different fields (dissemination material, Q4, 2016).  Work programme 2016  29  Stakeholder impact  The direct beneficiaries of the results of this work will be EU citizens, targeted by different categories, as well as end-user  organisations from public and private sectors (in particular in the area of EU NIS education). These stakeholders are ex- pected to reap the following benefits.  • Develop knowledge and corresponding ICT skills by being part of a best-practice-sharing community. • Improve and enhance contacts with stakeholders of similar interests and profiles. • Increase citizens’ awareness and governance on privacy when using online tools.  Legal base and policy context  • ENISA regulation, Article 3, particularly 3.1(c)(iv) and 3.1(c)(v). • ENISA stakeholder strategy. • Cybersecurity strategy of the European Union (Section 2.1). • Data protection directive 95/46/EC. • Proposal for a general data protection regulation.  4.3 SO3. To assist the Member States and the European Union  institutions and bodies in developing and implementing the  policies necessary to meet the legal and regulatory requirements  of network and information security  SO3 provides the framework for ENISA to assist the EU MS and the EU institutions in developing and implementing the  policies necessary to meet the legal and regulatory requirements of network and information security (NIS).  List of work packages and short description  • WPK3.1. Supporting EU policy development  The key objective of this work package (WPK) will be for ENISA to proactively contribute to the development of existing or  new EU policy initiatives (before they are launched) and assists the Commission, Member States and the private sector in  the implementation of existing policies in this area.  ENISA will achieve this objective by engaging with public and private stakeholders and leveraging its existing knowledge  and expertise in the area of secure infrastructure and services.  Another key objective of this WPK is cybersecurity standardisation. From its creation, ENISA has tracked the development  of standards in the area of NIS, maintaining close contacts and collaboration with international standardisation organisa- tions. This approach enables ENISA to keep its activities up-to-date with the latest developments as well as informing its  stakeholders on new NIS standardisation activities and to flag opportunities and/or risks as they develop.  Furthermore, ENISA will support this area, in cooperation with relevant stakeholders, by developing recommendations for  improving NIS in EU standardisation policy, providing guidelines of the possible frameworks that can be adopted in order  to achieve a harmonised scheme across MS, as well as setting recommendations for the stakeholders involved.  • WPK3.2. Supporting EU policy implementation  This WPK covers activities linked to the implementation of couple of directives and regulations (i.e. activities linked to  electronic identification and trust services (eIDAS) regulation, e-privacy directive and the proposed NIS directive) where  ENISA has been assigned a role and responsibilities and where NIS is one of the main goals or means to achieve suitable  implementation.  4 Core operational  ac tivit ies  30  Subject to its adoption, ENISA will cooperate with all EU Member States and the Commission to define the scope of the  NIS directive, the actions related to ENISA and the sectors and/or services affected. As a result of this the Agency will  then identify all relevant public and private stakeholders (e.g. competent authorities, manufacturers and operators) and  engage them in a structured dialogue on the key objectives of the NIS directive and how can be best implemented within  each sector and/or service.  ENISA work in the areas of privacy and trust has been ongoing for several years now, and the Agency has extensively  contributed to support the implementation of the personal data protection regulatory framework in many of its key  technological aspects. ENISA will continue to support the implementation of EC Regulation 611/2013 by providing assis- tance regarding technical protective measures (appropriate cryptographic protective measures) as the abovementioned  regulation requests ENISA to do.  ENISA will continue collecting and analysing annual national reports of security breaches from national regulatory author- ities (NRAs) in accordance with Article 13a of the framework directive on electronic communications. The Agency, in co- operation with experts from NRAs and the private sector (e.g. ENISA’s e-communications reference group, NIS platform.)  will analyse the national reports, compare them with previous years, identify new trends and develop good practices and  lessons learned.  Another area covered in this WPK is the support for the implementation of the Regulation (EU) No 910/2014 of the Euro- pean Parliament and of the Council of 23 July 2014 on electronic identification and trust services for electronic transac- tions in the internal market.  Trust services are a key enabler for increasing citizens’ confidence in online services, and given their nature, they require  a high level of security to ensure their integrity and reliability. ENISA has contributed extensively to the area of securing  trust services in the past by providing best practices for providers, recommendations on audit schemes, standardisation  guidance, security-breach reporting and recommendations, etc. Building on the work of 2015, in 2016 ENISA will focus on  the key areas of interest for stakeholders, where a contribution will be most useful to the community, the topics of assur- ance levels for electronic identification and security recommendations for relying parties of trust services.  4.3.1 WPK3.1. Supporting European Union policy development  4.3.1.1 WPK3.1.A. Contribution to EU policy linked to secure infrastructures and services  Desired impact  • By 2017, 15 companies and five MS competent authorities contribute to ENISA’s efforts in the area of cloud computing. • By 2017, 15 companies and five MS competent authorities contribute to ENISA’s efforts in the area of smart grids  and/or ICS-SCADA. • By 2017, 10 companies and five MS competent authorities contribute to ENISA’s efforts in the area of certification of  components and systems. • By 2017, 10 companies and five MS competent authorities contribute to ENISA’s efforts in the area of finance.  Description of tasks  In this WPK, ENISA will engage with public and private stakeholders and deploy state-of-the-art recommendations and  good practices in secure infrastructure and services with the objective of proactively contributing to the development of  existing or new EU policy initiatives (before they are launched) and assist the Commission, Member States and the private  sector in the implementation of existing policies in this area.  ENISA will achieve this objective by engaging with public and private stakeholders, by deploying existing expert groups  (e.g. the European SCADA and control systems information Exchange (EuroSCSIE)) and by leveraging its existing knowl- edge and expertise in the area of secure infrastructure and services. One of the key vehicles to deliver this is actually the  NIS platform (an EU-level PPP) but also dedicated, area-specific expert groups that develop useful insight, validate good  practices and issue practical recommendations. Whenever it is necessary ENISA will liaise with standards bodies to pro- vide its technical opinion on future standards in the areas below.  31  The main areas covered in this WPK are as follows.  EU cloud computing strategy and partnership  ENISA will continue to play an active role in the implementation of the EU’s cloud computing strategy and partnership.  The agency will provide technical advice, recommendations and information on good practices to the Commission and the  EU cloud partnership in the areas of certification, pre-commercial public procurement guidelines and incident-reporting  mechanisms. In all these areas ENISA will engage with all relevant public and private stakeholders and make sure that  these efforts properly align with EU ECP, ETSI and CEN/Cenelec initiatives.  EU smart grids and ICS-SCADA strategy  ENISA will assist the Commission, the Member States and the private sector in the implementation of the EU’s smart grid  strategy and ICS-SCADA actions. The agency, building on this existing knowledge and expertise, will provide sound techni- cal advice, recommendations and information on good practices in the area of minimum security measures for smart grids  and ICS-SCADA, certification of smart grid components, industrial IoT and incident-reporting mechanisms for national  critical industries. ENISA will engage with all relevant stakeholders, provide contributions to the Commission on policy  initiatives (e.g. EU CSS, DG Energy’s expert group 2 (EG2) and Energy expert cybersecurity platform (EECSP), CEN/Cenelec’s  M490, EuroSCSIE and distributed energy security knowledge (Densek)), and make sure that these efforts properly align  with EU’s overall smart grid policy.  Policy discussions on the certification of components and systems  ENISA will cooperate with the Commission, Member States and the private sector in order to foster EU policy discussion  regarding a European framework for the certification of components and systems. The agency will support the discussion  on the evolution of the existing initiatives. Through this, ENISA will be able to provide suggestions to key decision-makers  on the way MS and the EU should address this issue.  Work programme 2016  4 Core operational  ac tivit ies  32  EU policy on NIS matters of the finance sector  ENISA will continue its efforts in the area of the finance sector. The Agency will assist the Commission, MS competent  authorities and the private sector in the definition and implementation of the EU’s policy on NIS matters of the finance  sector. ENISA, using its knowledge and expertise in this area, will contribute to the third-party payments debate, the  risks in inter-banking transactions and secure communications debate, adoption of cloud computing by sector and the  harmonisation of audits and policies and others. ENISA will cooperate closely with relevant key stakeholders such as the  European Banking Authority (EBA), the European Central Bank (ECB) and leading financial institutions and providers to  achieve the goals in this area.  Outcomes and deadlines  D1: Contribute to EU policy in the area of cloud computing (workshops, meetings, Q1‑Q4, 2016).

Policy development and standards  Desired impact  • At least six stakeholders from policymakers, industry and research experts in NIS standardisation to contribute in  ENISA’s recommendations for improving NIS in EU standardisation policy.  Description of tasks  The new ENISA mandate gives the Agency a more proactive role in the area of standardisation. The task assigned to  ENISA by the new regulation is to support standardisation by facilitating the establishment and take-up of European and  international standards for risk management and for the security of electronic products, networks and services. A key ele- ment towards the objective of improved security standardisation is to facilitate close collaboration between policymakers,  standardisation organisations and industry. ENISA will facilitate the cooperation of stakeholders by engaging policymakers,  standardisation organisations and industry, with the aim of putting forward common strategies to enhance NIS in EU  standardisation policy.  Since 2012 ENISA has specifically participated in the creation and further work of the ETSI CEN-CENELEC Cyber Security  Coordination Group (CSCG). This will continue in 2016 and ENISA will collaborate in the activities of the CSCG and try to  further exploit synergies between the CSCG and its WP. The Agency will also involve standards bodies in the different  WPKs in as far as this is appropriate.  Furthermore, in order to enhance cooperation in this area among the different stakeholders, in 2015 ENISA conducted  a conference to align policymakers, industry and research experts in steering cybersecurity standardisation. Based on the  input from the participating experts and the ongoing collaboration with the CSCG, ENISA will further develop the work  done in 2015.  In 2016 the Agency will provide recommendations for improving NIS in EU standardisation policy and guidelines on the  possible frameworks that can be adopted in order to achieve a harmonised scheme across MS.  Outcomes and deadlines  Based on the tasks described above, the following outcomes and deliverables are envisaged:  D5: Recommendations for improving NIS in EU standardisation policy (Q4, 2016).  4 Core operational  ac tivit ies  34  Stakeholder impact  The direct beneficiaries of the results of this WPK will be the policymakers, framework programmes of EU-funded R & D,  standardisation bodies and end-user organisations from the public and private sectors, in particular in the areas of stand- ardisation related to NIS, privacy, cloud computing and smart grids.  Legal base and policy context  • ENISA regulation, Article 3, particularly 3.1(d)(i) and 3.1(d)(ii). • Council Resolution of 18 December 2009 on a collaborative European approach to network and information security  (2009/C 321/01). • CEN/Cenelec/ETSI CSCG White Paper No 01 Recommendations for a strategy on European cybersecurity  standardisation.  4.3.1.3 WPK3.1.C. Towards a digital single market for NIS and related IT products and services  Desired impact  • EU and national policymakers understand the strengths and weaknesses of the NIS and related IT sector in Europe. • EU and national policymakers understand how to develop a digital single market (DSM) for NIS and related products  and services.  Description of tasks  The aim of this WPK is to analyse how the NIS and related IT sectors can play a decisive role in a DSM at EU level. ENISA will  take stock of different market segments in the NIS and related IT areas and identify key European players having a major  market role in products, services or infrastructures.  This task should help ENISA to advise the Commission and Member States to better identify where efforts should be  placed in order to further support European NIS and related ICT industries and services in order to achieve and improve  the adequate level of diversity and trust in the EU.  The agency will form an expert group with senior experts from these private sector stakeholders and selected experts  from MS and the Commission to assess the technical competitive advantage of Europe in the area of NIS and provide  insight on how Europe could become a sustainable market player in NIS and related IT products and/or services without  setting up trade barriers or using other protectionist measures. Particular attention will be given to the DSM initiative of  the Commission and its outcomes.  The Agency will then develop useful recommendations on how Europe can support the DSM for NIS and identify the areas  and means to foster further actions.  Outcomes and deadlines  Based on the tasks described above, the following outcomes and deliverables are envisaged.  D6: Restricted.

Assist EU MS and Commission in the implementation of the NIS directive  Desired impact  • By 2017, 10 MS contribute to ENISA’s efforts for harmonised implementation of the NIS directive. • By 2017, 20 major private organisations contribute to ENISA’s efforts for harmonised implementation of the NIS  directive. • By 2018, five MS deploy ENISA’s guidelines on NIS directive in a 3 sectors/services. • By 2018, 10 private organisations deploy ENISA’s guidelines on NIS directive in a 3 sectors/services.  Description of tasks  This work package aims to help EU MS, the private sector and the Commission to implement the NIS directive.  Subject to its adoption and in alignment with the tasks and roles allocated to ENISA in this directive, the Agency will coop- erate with all EU Member States and the Commission to refine the scope of the NIS directive, the actions related to ENISA  and the sectors and/or services affected.  As a result of this the agency will then identify all relevant public and private stakeholders (e.g. competent authorities,  manufacturers and operators) and engage them in a structured dialogue on the key objectives of the NIS directive and  how it can be best implemented within each sector and/or service. Possible actions include those mentioned in the cur- rent NIS directive draft (e.g. incident reporting per sector, trusted information sharing per sector, NCSS, PPPs). Based on  the feedback from the relevant public and private stakeholders ENISA will then analyse the key actions, identify possible  implementation approaches, analyse good practices and challenges, and finally issue guidelines and recommendations on  the implementation of those NIS directive actions.  ENISA will do its utmost to achieve consistency and harmonisation among the different implementation approaches  across sectors. Emphasis will be given to applying similar approaches, concepts, frameworks, good practices, recommen- dations, parameters and/or thresholds per sector. By doing this we hope to develop an easy, consistent and affordable  implementation scheme across sectors. Such schemes would allow the proper use of exchanged information and pave the  way for consistent analysis across sectors.  ENISA will also take stock of and analyse all existing national (e.g. UK: Cyber Essential), EU and international cybersecu- rity baseline frameworks and standards. The Agency will then identify good practices and propose measures needed to  achieve minimum security measures for all the sectors defined in the NIS directive. ENISA will engage both private and  public sectors in the process to validate the findings and make sure that the end result is easy, affordable and effective.  In this effort ENISA will leverage its existing knowledge and expertise in stakeholder engagement with the public and/ or the private sector. The agency will also deploy its existing stakeholder communities such as the NIS platform, existing  national PPPs and other expert groups established by ENISA and others in different sectors. ENISA will also capitalise on its  domain knowledge and expertise in certain sectors already mentioned by the NIS directive (e.g. energy, transport, health).  The agency has already developed good practices and issued recommendations for several key actions already mentioned  by the NIS directive in a few sectors, e.g. minimum security measures for smart grids, incident-reporting schemes for  cloud computing, NCSS, national PPPs, and others. These results will become useful input in the process and enable faster  development of necessary implementation schemes.  4 Core operational  ac tivit ies  36  Outcomes and deadlines  D1: Guidelines for the implementation of mandatory incident reporting in the context of the NIS directive (report, Q4,  2016).

Work programme 2016  37  Description of tasks  ENISA work on the areas of privacy and trust has been ongoing for several years now, and the Agency has contributed  extensively to assist the implementation of the personal data protection regulatory framework in many of its key tech- nological aspects. As an example of this support, the Commission published in 2013 the Regulation 611/2013 on the  measures applicable to the notification of personal data breaches under Directive 2002/58/EC on privacy and electronic  communications. Article 4(3) of the regulation sets out that the Commission will publish an indicative list of appropriate  technological protection measures which shall render the data unintelligible to any person who is not authorised to access  it, after consultation with the Article 29 Working Party, ENISA and the European Data Protection Supervisor (EDPS).  As a core activity in supporting the protection of personal information, ENISA provided recommendations on technological  measures to protect the confidentiality, integrity and authenticity of personal data. In this respect, since 2013 ENISA has  produced a report on the appropriate technological measures to protect information and communication through the use  of cryptographic techniques. In 2016, ENISA will shift the focus of the deliverable on appropriate technological protection  measures, from algorithms to the application domain, providing guidelines on how to specifically apply existing cryptograph- ic technologies to protect privacy and trust. The study will address current and emerging technologies for data confidential- ity, integrity and authenticity; both in storage and in transit. The report aims to be a useful tool for data controllers on how  to better apply cryptography to improve the protection of personal data. ENISA will create an expert group (with represent- atives from MS) that will participate in the elaboration process of the study to maximise alignment with national guidelines.  Furthermore, ENISA will ensure continuity for the activities where the Agency has achieved high expertise in the area of  privacy, as well as introducing some emerging new topics which have become relevant for the privacy community. For  example, the Agency will carry on with its work on privacy enhancing technologies (PETs). Based on the findings of previ- ous years, the report on the evolution, newest ideas and most up-to-date features of PETs and their building blocks, will  explore the landscape of PETs and associated organisational measures, their specific applications and how they can be  used to fulfil the legal requirements. The report will empower the competent authorities in the Member States to detail  their own guidelines for their respective communities. Furthermore, the report will bring the different levels of maturity  of technologies into the picture. This will help the EU and MS funding agencies to call for targeted R & D efforts to improve  the overall availability of PETs.  Another area where ENISA will work in 2016 is the protection of personal data and security in electronic applications  (i.e. healthcare). As new mechanisms and tools for online information processing appear (including storage, merging and  correlation of data), in particular with the use of cloud services and smart mobile devices, the risk of exposure of sensitive  medical data seriously increases. Therefore, using — among others — the results of the Agency’s 2015 study on big data,  ENISA will focus especially on the new and/or emerging means of personal data processing in online and mobile applica- tions and the threats and risks that these create for these data. In particular, ENISA will provide a state-of-the-art analysis  of the aforementioned risks and will propose a list of technical and organisational measures for managing and mitigating  them. The result of the overall work will aim primarily at supporting users of online and mobile applications to protect  their personal data, as well as data controllers who offer relevant services to citizens.  Finally, ENISA will host in 2016 the fourth edition of the Annual Privacy Forum (APF). The APF aims to provide an open  forum where policymakers, researches and industry experts can discuss the key topics and new challenges in the field  of data protection. Already in its fourth edition, the APF has become a reference conference for the privacy community  in Europe. The objective of the Agency for 2016, as in previous years, will be to address the topics which are of current  interest for the privacy community, in order to reach the maximum number of relevant participants, representing different  stakeholder communities across Member States.  Regarding new activities, the agency conducted in 2015 a Europe wide survey on new directions on securing personal  data, with the aim of gathering stock on the opinions of relevant experts in the area of privacy. Based on the results of  this study, in 2016 ENISA will implement guidelines for data controllers on technological measures for securing the auto- mated processing of personal data. This study will cover best practices and specific recommendations for the appropriate  protection of personal data in automated systems. The report will focus especially on SMEs and other small-scale data  controllers, where there is a currently a lack of documentation, as well as a high demand for guidelines to mitigate the risk  of breaches and to achieve compliance with existing regulations.  4 Core operational  ac tivit ies  38  Outcomes and deadlines  Based on the tasks described above, the following outcomes and deliverables are envisaged.  D5: Evolution and state of the art of privacy enhancing technologies and their building blocks (Q4, 2016). D6: 2016 edition of the report on appropriate technological protection measures to preserve privacy and trust (Q4, 2016). D7: Data protection and security in online and mobile applications (i.e. healthcare) (Q4, 2016). D8: Annual Privacy Forum (Q2, 2016). D9: Guidelines for data controllers on securing the automated processing of personal data (Q4, 2016).  Stakeholder impact  By supporting the development of guidelines for a broad range of privacy topics in the light of the new data protection  regulation, the direct beneficiaries of the results of this WPK will be policymakers, supervisory bodies, research organisa- tion and data controllers.  Legal base and policy context  • ENISA regulation, Article 3, particularly 3.1(a)(ii), 3.1(b)(i) and 3.1(c)(ii). • Cybersecurity strategy of the European Union. • Data protection directive 95/46/EC.  Work programme 2016  39  • Commission Regulation (EU) No 611/2013 of 24 June 2013 on the measures applicable to the notification of personal  data breaches under Directive 2002/58/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council on privacy and electronic  communications.  • Proposal for a general data protection regulation.  4.3.2.3 WPK3.2.C. Assistance in the implementation of mandatory incident‑reporting schemes  Desired impact  • By 2017, 15 Member States make direct use of the outcomes of Article 13a work by explicitly referencing it or by  adopting it at national level.  • By 2017, 10 major e-communication providers across the EU comply with ENISA’s minimum security measures. • By 2017, 15 Member States contribute to ENISA’s efforts on harmonised implementation of Article 19 of eIDAS  regulation.  Description of tasks  This work package focuses on assisting regulatory authorities in the implementation of EU regulations related to manda- tory incident reporting. It builds on successful work done in this area over the years in the area of Article 13a.  The main tasks of this work package are to support the following.  • NRAs and EU MS on the implementation of Article 13a (security-breach notification) and Article 4 (personal data  breach notification) and developing synergies among them.  • NRAs and EU MS on the implementation of Article 19 of new regulation on eIDAS. • ENISA will continue collecting and analysing annual, national reports of security breaches from NRAs in accordance  with Article 13a of the framework directive on electronic communications. The Agency, in cooperation with experts  from NRAs and the private sector (e.g. ENISA’s e-communications reference group, NIS platform), will analyse the  national reports, compare them with previous years, identify new trends and develop good practices and lessons  learned. The Agency will select two major root causes of incidents, deeply analyse them and issue good practices and  recommendations to NRAs and e-communication providers that would allow them to better protect themselves from  such root causes in the future.  ENISA will cooperate with electronic communications providers and MS competent authorities (e.g. NRAs and DPAs) to  address security, privacy and confidentiality issues in an integrated and holistic manner. In that respect the Agency, in co- operation with the Commission, will continue its efforts towards a harmonised reporting scheme for the e-communication  providers that would address both Article 4 and Article 13a requirements.  ENISA will continue its efforts to develop common guidelines for a cost-effective mandatory security-breach notification  scheme implementing Article 19 of eIDAS regulation. The Agency, building on the Forum of European supervisory author- ities for electronic signatures (FESA) and other related public and private stakeholder groups, will bring all competent  authorities of the EU together to discuss the scope of the scheme, the services affected, the impact of the incidents  reported (e.g. parameters and thresholds), the reporting attributes, the reporting modalities, the reporting tools and oth- ers. ENISA will also engage in a dialogue with the relevant private sector entities and relevant standardisation bodies (e.g.  ETSI) about the different options available in order to better understand their needs and requirements and work towards  building a consistent and cost-effective schema. In this context ENISA will also try to exploit all possible implementation  and conceptual synergies with Article 13a and Article 4.  Outcomes and deadlines  Based on the tasks described above, the following outcomes and deliverables are envisaged.  D10: Annual incident analysis report (Article 13a) (workshop and report, Q3, 2016).  4 Core operational  ac tivit ies  40  D11: Analysis of major root causes — good practices and recommendations for NRAs and e‑communication providers  (workshop and report, Q4, 2016). D12: Contribute to EU policy in the area of electronic communications sector (workshops, meetings, Q1‑Q4, 2016).  D13: Engaging eIDAS competent authorities and private sector in the implementation of Article 19 (workshops, meetings,  Q1‑Q4, 2016). D14: Guidelines for mandatory incident reporting in the context of eIDAS (report, Q4, 2016).  Stakeholder impact  Telecommunications sector  • Supervisory authorities will have practical references and technical guidelines to implement the legislation. • Within the area of Article 13a, the industry, NRAs and the Commission will be able to develop a better understanding  of the significant incidents at European level as well as a comparison with earlier years and recommendations, which  will support mitigation decisions and actions.  • The Commission (DG Communications Networks, Content and Technology, DG Migration and Home Affairs and DG  Justice and Consumers) will achieve harmonisation of incident reporting, breach notifications and security measures,  following international standards and can in this way forego further detailing of the legislative text.  • Industry (network providers, internet service providers (ISPs), cloud providers, etc.) will be able to adopt a single  framework of incident reporting/breach notification and security measures, so there is a level playing field across the  EU MS and no complications for working across borders.  • Cooperate with Member States and private sector to develop an e-communications networks resilience. • ISPs and internet exchange points (IXPs) will be able to better use the existing technology to better serve customers  during crises and offer related services.  Regulation on electronic identification and trusted services  • NRAs and DPAs will be able to implement an efficient reporting scheme which is very similar to the Article 13a  scheme currently in place, and in this way lay the basis for a coherent and holistic picture of security incidents across  key service providers.  • A single reporting scheme will allow trust service providers to operate more easily across borders, effectively paving  the way for a single market of trust service providers across the EU. In turn this facilitates cross-border online servic- es, such as e-commerce and e-government.  Legal base and policy context  • ENISA regulation Article 3, in particular Articles 3.1(a), 3.1(b) on capacity building and 3.1(c). • Cybersecurity strategy of the European Union: Council Resolution of 18 December 2009. • CIIP action plan 2009 and 2011. • Internal security strategy for the European Union.  4.3.2.4 WPK3.2.D. Support for policy implementation in the area of electronic identification and  trust services  Desired impact  • At least six stakeholders from trust service providers, online services providers, conformity assessment bodies and  supervisory authorities contribute in ENISA guidelines and best practices recommendations regarding electronic  identification and trust services.  • At least 10 experts from the community participate in the validation of the results of the studies.  Work programme 2016  41  Description of tasks  The main objective of this WPK is to continue to support the large-scale adoption of secure electronic identification means  and trust services across Europe. Trust services are a key enabler for increasing citizens’ confidence in online services,  and given their nature, they require a high level of security to ensure their integrity and reliability. ENISA has contributed  extensively to the area of securing trust services in the past by providing best practices for providers, recommendations  on audit schemes, standardisation guidance, security-breach reporting recommendations, etc.  From the policy perspective, a milestone in this area was achieved with the adoption of the Regulation (EU) No 910/2014  of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 July 2014 on electronic identification and trust services for electronic  transactions in the internal market. ENISA aims to support the implementation of the regulation by further focusing on  the security aspects related to trust services providers.  In order to identify key aspects and gaps this area, in 2015 ENISA launched, in collaboration with the EC, a forum that  brings together communities, namely: trust service providers from the EU trusted lists, conformity assessment bodies and  supervisory authorities. The forum has proven to be a useful tool for identifying gaps and areas where further work is  needed, and its activities will continue in 2016.  ENISA will continue working on the implementation and update of the guidelines for security-breach notification to su- pervisory bodies by trust service providers (facilitating the application of the obligation stemming from Article 19 of the  regulation).  ENISA will continue supporting the EC in the assessment of the candidate standards that might be listed in implementing  acts that may be adopted by the EC. The scope will be enlarged to include electronic identification (eIDs), the issues of  conformity assessment and certification frameworks.  The study on security recommendations for relying parties of trust services, will produce guidelines for online services pro- viders acting as relying parties for trust services provided by third parties, on how to ensure the correct implementation of  the trust chain. The report will focus on the area of website authentication; the trust service with the highest impact on  online transactions. Website authentication is a key element to create trust between online service providers and citizens.  Online service providers, which can range from small SMEs to large public administrations, rely on website authentication  certificates and protocols to prove their identity to their consumers. However, website authentication protocols and their  building blocks are one of the main targets for emerging attacks and new vulnerabilities appear frequently.  Finally, the 2016 edition of the report on appropriate technological protection measures to preserve privacy and trust will  also support the implementation of the eIDAS regulatory framework, by addressing technological aspects and building  blocks for trust services.  Outcomes and deadlines  Based on the tasks described above, the following outcomes and deliverables are envisaged.  D15: Update on standards for trust services and electronic identification (Q4, 2016). D16: Report on security recommendations for relying parties of trust services (Q4, 2016).  Stakeholder impact  The direct beneficiaries of the results of this WPK will be:  • trust service providers • online service providers • regulatory authorities • supervisory bodies • conformity assessment bodies.  4 Core operational  ac tivit ies  42  Stakeholders will benefit by receiving guidance on how to implement the new regulatory framework, as well as recom- mendations on security measures to ensure integrity and reliability of the trust services they provide or consume.  Legal base and policy context  • ENISA regulation, Article 3, particularly 3.1(a)(ii), 3.1(b)(i) and 3.1(c)(ii). • Regulation (EU) No 910/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 July 2014 on electronic identifica-  tion and trust services for electronic transactions in the internal market. • Commission communication — ‘A coherent framework for building trust in the digital single market for e-commerce  and online services’, COM(2011) 942 final of 11 January 2012.  4.4 SO4. To enhance cooperation both between the Member States  of the European Union and between related network and  information security communities  SO4 covers aspects of cooperation between the EU MS and the EU and between related NIS communities where ENISA  could play a hole to enhance NIS cooperation.  List of work packages and short description  • WPK4.1. Cyber crisis cooperation and exercises  In the context of this work package (WKP), ENISA will further enhance its methodology, seminars, training and technical  capabilities on the organisation and management of large-scale cyber crisis exercises. The Agency will continue enhancing  its internal capabilities for managing complex, distributed exercises, by building on its previous efforts. ENISA will explore  new opportunities which will enhance the overall realism of cyber exercises.  In 2016, ENISA will organise the fourth pan-European cyber exercise, Cyber Europe 2016 (CE2016). This exercise will build  on the experience gained in previous exercises and will take into account previously identified recommendations and  findings.  Furthermore ENISA will continue supporting Member States towards the development of a sound and implementable  European cyber crisis cooperation framework and procedures.  • WPK4.2. NIS community building  The key goal of this WPK is to build upon the good experience ENISA has in supporting different operational communities  (CSIRT, law enforcement communities, European financial institutes — information sharing and analysis centre (FI-ISAC),  A-ISAC, etc.) to enhance mutually satisfactory ways to collaborate.  ENISA will develop and provide guidance based on best practice in the area of operational community efforts (operational  cooperation, information exchange, etc.). Where possible, synergies with other ENISA collaboration- and community-sup- porting efforts such as the NIS platform will be extended and, where needed, developed.  The Agency will continue its work and support of the Transits training in the area of CSIRTs in order to build communities  through a ‘learning by doing’ approach.  ENISA will also continue to support the collaboration between CSIRT and law enforcement communities, based on the  recent policy and technical developments in this area in Member States.  Work programme 2016  43  4.4.1 WPK4.1. Cyber crisis cooperation and exercises  Desired impact  • At least 10 Member States and EU institutions take part in the study on cyber crisis cooperation and exercise activities  and findings.  • At least 24 EU Member States and European Free Trade Association (Stockholm Convention) (EFTA) countries confirm  their support for Cyber Europe 2016 (CE2016).  • At least 20 EU Member States will attend the ENISA event which aims to promote cyber crisis cooperation activities  within the context of the existing NIS policy framework.  Description of tasks  Objectives  • Continue the work in the area of pan-European cyber exercises (Cyber Europe 2016) by adapting to the needs of  ENISA stakeholders.  • Enhance the capacity to support and organise cyber exercises in Europe by organising small-scale regional exercises  (EuroSOPEx).  • Identify good practices and improve operational procedures for cyber crisis cooperation in Europe within the context  of the NIS policy framework.  • Promote best practices in the area of cyber crisis cooperation and exercises at EU and international level by engaging  the NIS community.  • Draft in close cooperation with the Member States a pan-European roadmap for cyber exercises.  Pan-European cyber exercises: Cyber Europe 2016  In 2016, ENISA will organise the fourth pan-European cyber exercise; CE2016. This exercise will closely follow up and build  on the lessons learned and actions from previous exercises, such as Cyber Europe 2014 (CE2014).  CE2016 will be an exercise programme focusing on testing and training on large-scale incident management cooperation  procedures at EU and national-levels. The efforts will not focus only on organising a one-off event but rather to be a con- tinuous effort throughout the year, offering preparatory training and cooperation opportunities such as small exercises  to Member States and the EU institutions (EuroSOPEx). The exercise escalation and build-up will be realistic and focused  in order to better capture how incidents are managed and cooperation happens in real-life. The high-level exercise pro- gramme brief will have to be prepared based the lessons learned from CE2014, approved by the Member States and the  ENISA MB, and drive the whole planning process.  Following that, the detailed set-up and exercise plan will be agreed with the EU, EFTA members and EU institutions, in line  with the existing NIS policy context. Each country will be represented in the exercise planners group. This group will be  responsible for the approval of the detailed exercise set-up and plan. The approach that will be followed will be that of an  opt-in scheme for the identification of stakeholders in the countries which are interested to play in the exercise (e.g. policy  level), allowing for the countries who wish and have the appropriate resources to extend their national play.  As previously established, ENISA will not invite international organisations or participants from countries other than EU  and EFTA members to participate in EU cybersecurity exercises without having first obtained the approval of the ENISA  MB.  Enhancing the capacity to support and organise cyber exercises  ENISA will further enhance its methodology, seminars, training and technical capabilities on the organisation and man- agement of cyber crisis exercises. The Agency will continue enhancing its internal capabilities for managing complex, dis- tributed exercises by building on its previous efforts. ENISA will explore new opportunities which will enhance the overall  realism of cyber exercises.  4 Core operational  ac tivit ies  44  Furthermore, ENISA will support smaller-scale exercises, bilateral or regional, within the EU upon request. The requests  can be sent based on Article 14 of the ENISA regulation. Support could be offered with seminars and exercise planning  training, as well as actual exercise planning support including the utilisation of the cyber exercise platform (CEP), given  the resource availability of the Agency.  ENISA, in close cooperation with the EU Member States and institutions, will draft a proposal for a pan-European roadm- ap for cyber exercises. This proposal will be built on the foundation of previous consultations done with the EU Member  States and institutions.  Cyber crisis cooperation and exercises activities overview  ENISA will continue supporting Member States towards the development of sound and implementable European cyber  crisis cooperation framework and procedures. The Agency will continue exploring requirements for developing infrastruc- tures for cooperation, e.g. secure communications channels or directories.  In this context, ENISA will host a workshop on EU-SOPs as a follow-up the exercise activities. Also ENISA will issue an up- date of its report on activities in the area of cyber crisis cooperation. In addition, this report will help ENISA to reach out  to other communities/sectors.  ENISA will also ensure that adequate feedback and follow-up to previous findings and recommendations are reported  back to the stakeholders.  Outcomes and deadlines  Based on the tasks described above, the following outcomes and deliverables are envisaged:  D1: Cyber Europe 2016: exercise plan and exercises (exercise Q4, 2016). D2: EuroSOPEx 2016: exercise plan and exercises (exercises Q4, 2016). D3: Pan‑European cyber exercises roadmap (report Q4, 2016). D4: Cyber crisis cooperation procedures: follow up the NIS policy framework (report Q4, 2016).  Stakeholder impact  The primary beneficiaries of this WPK will be policymakers and organisations from public and private sectors, who will  receive integrated and consolidated information about the European NIS threat landscape and how it is evolving.

ENISA will also continue to support the collaboration between CSIRT and law enforcement communities, based on the  recent policy and technical developments in this area in Member States. This work will include close collaboration with  other institutions which are active in this field, namely the EC3. Activities agreed upon in the collaboration agreement be- tween ENISA and EC3 will be further developed, for example in the area of encouraging a more practical and regular flow  of information between CSIRTs and law enforcement communities, the exchange of specific knowledge and expertise,  elaboration of general situational reports, reports resulting from strategic analyses and best practice and strengthening  capacity building through training and awareness raising in order to safeguard NIS at EU level. For better coordination and  in order to avoid overlaps ENISA will stay engaged in the EC3 programme board. The very well established, commonly  organised ENISA-EC3 workshop will be continued.  Following its successful mechanism for building the European national and governmental CSIRT community trust and  collaboration, ENISA will organise its traditional workshop to support the national and governmental CSIRT community  grow. (11th CSIRTs in Europe workshop).  Outcomes and deadlines  Based on the tasks described above, the following outcomes and deliverables are envisaged.  D1: Continuation of existing community efforts (European FI‑ISAC, FIRST, TF‑CSIRT‑TI, etc.). D2: Annual ENISA national and governmental CSIRT workshop (Q4, 2016). D3: Annual ENISA/EC3 cybercrime workshop (Q4, 2016). D4: Supporting European network of MS CSIRTs. D5: Review on new operational communities’ development (A‑ISAC, etc.) (Q4, 2016).  Stakeholder impact  • More effective information flows between the existing community efforts (FIRST, etc.). • Timely information provided to key stakeholders on NIS incidents and on significant developments in the field. • Enhanced collaboration and trust building for different communities (European national and governmental CSIRT  community, CSIRT and law enforcement communities, etc.). • Regular updates on current and future policy efforts and developments in the incident response area.  Legal base and policy context  • ENISA regulation, Article 3, particularly 3.1(b) and 3.1(c). • Proposed NIS directive.  Work programme 2016  47  4.5 Horizontal activities supporting core operations  4.5.1 Management board, executive board and permanent stakeholders group  secretariat  During 2016, ENISA will continue to support its formal bodies, the management board (MB) and the PSG as well as the  executive board (EB) in their functions by providing secretariat functions.  For the MB, one ordinary meeting will be organised during 2016 and informal meetings will be held as necessary. The ex- isting electronic newsletter will be continued throughout 2016, as will support for the MB portal. For the PSG two formal  meetings will also be organised in the course of the year.  For the EB formal meetings will be organised during 2016; once per quarter (Q).  ENISA will continue to explore additional ways of supporting the ENISA statutory bodies in the most effective way, includ- ing the possible use of new technologies and modifications to existing processes as required.  The MB, executive board and PSG secretariat reports directly to the ED.  4.5.2 National liaison officer network Since 2014, ENISA has initiated a number of activities with the aim to strengthen cooperation within the national liaison  officers’ (NLO) network. NLOs are key actors for the Agency’s daily work and interaction, assuring, in terms of outreach,  effective liaison with the MS and dissemination of ENISA deliverables.  In 2016, ENISA will build upon these efforts and improve its cooperation with the NLO network, the first point of contact  for ENISA in the MS. In particular, the Agency will continue working on the following actions.  • An NLO meeting will be organised where possible improvements of the collaboration will be discussed. Improve- ments aim at leveraging the NLO network for the dissemination of ENISA deliverables.  • Information will be sent to the members of the NLO network at regular intervals on upcoming ENISA project-related  tenders, vacancy notices, and events organised by ENISA or which the Agency contributes to (for example co-organ- iser, etc.).  • The agency will maintain and share with the NLO network information on all relevant ENISA project activities (e.g.  unit responsible for the project, relevant tender results).  4.5.3 European Union relations As in previous years, the Agency will carry out the bulk of its EU relations work with the statutory stakeholders; the Com- mission, the EU Parliament, the Council (working groups) and MS, by using senior management for developing relations.  This approach will take due account of the management structure of the Agency so that the level of participation in any  particular meeting is appropriate. A similar approach is taken for speaking engagements.  In general, contacts at the highest level will be managed by the ED with the heads of department as backups depending  on the subject to be discussed.  4.5.4 Spokesperson, stakeholders communication and dissemination activities In 2016, ENISA will seek to improve its focus on its key activities and to provide regular information to the press and media  regarding these activities. In order to achieve this, the Agency spokesperson will be located in the Athens office and will  be in constant contact with the operational teams.  4 Core operational  ac tivit ies  48  The Agency will continue developing various tools and channels such as info graphics, the ENISA website, social media,  social networking and videos, etc.  Dissemination activities are the responsibility of the project managers, who will also work closely with the NLO contact  point and the spokesman.  4.5.5 Quality control and project office The quality control (QC) of the Agency aims to respond to a mix of regulatory and stakeholder requirements in an effort to  improve organisational performance and compliance. Scheduled annual activities associated with the promulgation and  maintenance of standard operating procedures (SOP) and a methodology, support the operational processes of the Agen- cy. The primary goal of the QC is to improve performance across the core operations, while reducing operational costs and  enhancing stakeholder satisfaction. The methodology is based on the plan-do-check-act (PDCA) cycle.  The project office in the Core operations department (COD) seeks to better coordinate the increasing number of activities  that cut across multiple operational areas within the department. Such activities include the preparation of briefings on  global issues and coordinating the coherence of recommendations across the department, the preparation of formal  documents, follow up on performance management, project management, etc.  Information security management systems (ISMS). In 2016 ENISA plans to further develop the management of informa- tion security risks and controls under the authority of the Agency’s management. The ISMS includes people, processes,  IT systems and policies. While elements of an ISMS (e.g. risk assessment, assets inventory) are well developed, targeted  efforts aim to improve both (a) the management of recurrent intrusion detection and vulnerabilities analysis exercises  and (b) the documented policy framework which is currently at the disposal of the Agency for the purpose of enhancing  the compliance position of the Agency. While these efforts are likely to lower the risk profile of the Agency, they will also  provide the added benefit of hands-on experience and allow the Agency to better guide other similar organisations and  agencies among its stakeholders, as need be.  4.5.6 Article 14 requests Article 14 requests are a mechanism that allows the MS or EU institutions to make direct requests to ENISA for carrying  out particular activities. This mechanism has become increasingly accepted in the last few years and it has grown in sig- nificance to the extent that the Agency believes that it needs to be explicitly planned for in the annual WP. Under SO2,  both WPKs WPK2.1 Assist MS capacity building and WPK2.2 Support EU institutions include deliverables dedicated to  assistance/on-request support for EU MS and institutions.  Although, by definition, it is not possible to predict the exact number or the orientation of the requests that the Agency  will receive in 2016, based on past experience the allocated resources are indicated in the summary of activities and  budget allocation section at the end of this document.  4.5.7 Data protection officer The main tasks of the data protection officer (DPO) include the following. • Inform and advise ENISA of its obligations pursuant to Regulation 45/2001/EC and to document this activity and the  responses received. • Monitor the implementation and application of ENISA’s policies in relation to the protection of personal data. • Monitor the implementation and application of Regulation 45/2001/EC at ENISA, including the requirements for data  security, information of data subjects and their requests in exercising their rights under the regulation, as well as the  requirements for prior check or prior consultation with the EDPS.  • Monitor the documentation, notification and communication of personal data in the context of ENISA’s operations. • Act as ENISA’s contact point for the EDPS on issues related to the processing of personal data; to cooperate and con-  sult with the EDPS whenever needed.  49  Work programme 2016  5  Management, administration  and support activities  5.1 Executive director’s office The executive director (ED)’s office consists of the ED and personal assistant. The ED is responsible for the overall man- agement of the Agency.  The two heads of department (Administration and support department and Core operations department), the corporate  communications officer and the Management Board and Permanent Stakeholders Group Secretariat report directly to the ED.  5.2 Administration and support department The Administration and support department (ASD) consists of Finance, accounting and procurement unit (FAP), the HR  section, the IT unit (ITU), and the team supporting the department.  The ASD is responsible for ensuring that the management of the Agency is in line with the regulatory framework estab- lished by the competent EU institutions, the MB, and the ED. The regulatory framework is composed of the financial regu- lation and the staff regulations and their respective implementing rules, as well as administrative procedures, the internal  control framework and other control mechanisms put in place to ensure compliance with the rules.  The ASD monitors the Agency control and risk framework. Constant upgrading of the internal systems and revision of the  operating standards set the ground for continuous optimisation of the internal processes and procedures. Benchmarking  with other organisations, as well as the recommendations of the European Court of Auditors (CoA) and the Internal audit  service (IAS) are used as internal performance indicators and relevant possibilities of improvement are considered.  5 Management,  administration and suppor t ac tivit ies  50  The head of the ASD (HoASD) develops the agency strategy for the administration and support activities (ASA) in line with  the WP and with the required compliance with the abovementioned bodies and rules. The HoASD is also the main contact  point as regards administrative matters, with external stakeholders such as European Commission services and DGs, the  European Parliament, the Council, the ENISA EB, ENISA MB, Hellenic authorities, etc. The head of department is supported  by the legal officer and two assistants who also support the units in the department.  5.3 Activities  5.3.1 ASA 0 Executive director’s office and general management The activities of the executive director’s (ED’s) office and general management consist of defining and implementing the  Agency’s strategy, planning, decision-making and overall management activities.  5.3.2 ASA 1 Quality management systems, ICC, security, facilities management,  internal communications  The main activities of ASA 1 supervised by the HoASD include quality management systems, internal control function  (head of administration provides the ICC), facilities management (FM) and internal communications (ICom).  ASA1 also covers: physical security and safety; support to the ICC (including risks assessment, ex post controls, etc.); Hel- lenic authorities (value-added tax (VAT) management; individual privileges management, etc.) and protocol; FM (including  building maintenance and management); internal communication and staff welfare; management reporting; support IAS/ CoA (including external audit), etc.; ENISA general report; multiannual staff policy plan. Quality management (QM) sys- tems include policies, procedures, internal workflows, compliance, organisation structure, resources to meet internal and  external stakeholder’s requirements and expectations.  In 2016 ENISA will continue to re-engineer selected  operational processes, to align organisational require- ments with actual implementation and pursue process  improvements across the board. Measuring the perfor- mance of recently designed processes, e.g. the ENISA  project management guide, for the purpose of proposing  suitable adjustments will be a priority. A risk assessment  methodology will be implemented for agency-wide risks,  as necessary. A set of tools such as electronic signatures,  electronic workflows and enterprise resource manage- ment tools are likely to be further integrated to facilitate  collaboration. Regular presentations and updates are  made available to provide guidance and promote the  performance of the quality management system.  Physical security and FM is carried out in a coherent  manner across both ENISA sites and both functions re- port into the head of administration. These activities will  ensure that staff benefit from an ergonomic and secure  environment in both agency locations. Furthermore, the  agency will ensure that the approach to logical and phys- ical security is aligned in order to ensure appropriate  protection of data.  Work programme 2016  51  FM services cater for a quality working environment and infrastructure across its two fully functional offices, ensuring  proper working conditions for the staff of the Agency. Activities include the following.  • Logistics, transport and delivery services. • Buildings and inventory management. • Purchase of stationery and consumables.  In 2016, the ICC and internal audit capability (IAC) function will monitor the Agency’s activity in administrative trans- actions, assess the risk framework and the controls in place, contribute to mapping and monitoring the key risk areas,  follow-up of the implementation of the auditors’ recommendations (CoA and the IAS) and issue exception management  reports.  ENISA will outsource the IAC to the Commission IAS and support all preventive or corrective activities resulting from the  audits performed by IAS.  The ICC and IAC will also ensure that procedures defined are effectively implemented and will carry out spot checks  (ex post controls) as required under the Agency’s financial regulation.  5.3.3 ASA 2 Finance, accounting and procurement The activities of the FAP unit consist of managing the budget of the Agency, conducting all procurement procedures and  accounting.  The mission of the accounting officer, who is functionally independent, is to execute payments and recover funds in ac- cordance with the instructions of the responsible authorising officer, to manage the treasury of the Agency, validate the  accounting systems and prepare quality annual accounts, in compliance with the applicable financial and accounting rules.  The activities of the unit are listed below.  • Financial transactions’ initiation. • Central financial verification of all financial transactions. • Budget preparation and management. • Mission management and helpdesk. • Financial helpdesk and reporting. • Accounting activities. • Statutory reporting activities, including discharge procedure. • Procurement procedures’ overall management, including procurement planning. • Overall contracts’ management. • Coordination of audits and support to all other audit assignments. • Internal training related to FAP activities. • Single point of contact for financial management matters to DG Budget (e.g. ABAC implementation). • Drafting internal financial policies. • Introducing solutions to optimise internal financial workflows.  52  52  5.3.4 ASA 3 Human resources  The activities of human resources (HR) consist in managing the rights and obligations of ENISA staff, recruitment and training.  • Management of individual staff rights and obligations, according to the stipulations of the staff regulations (SR). • Recruitment procedures. • Entitlements and leave management. • Drafting internal HR policies and implementing rules of the SR. • Medical services and health in work environment. • Training plan and career development. • Management of interim services. • Work environment and welfare.  5.3.5 ASA 4 Information and communications technology  The IT unit (named ITU) delivers internal IT systems and services to the Agency, across its two fully functional offices, as  well as to a highly mobile user-base. The IT team uses the IT Infrastructure Library (ITIL) framework as a source of good  practice in service management. Both human and financial resources are organised according to ITIL, as shown in the  summary table in the following section.  The IT team also provides infrastructure services for operational systems, e.g. Cyber Exercise Platform.  The activities of IT include help desk, operations and monitoring, services management and infrastructure management,  solutions and development. Activities have been aligned with ITIL, including budget lines, as follows: • service strategy • service transition • service security • service operations • external services • service support.  5 Management,  administration and suppor t ac tivit ies  53  Work programme 2016  6.1 Summary of core operational activities with strategic objectives,  work packages and deliverables  SO1.

Core activities are those aiming to create the impact in the core field of NIS, required by the regulation of ENI- SA and interpreted in the current policy and legal context. ASA, on the other hand, aim to provide strategic and overall  management orientation, support the core activities with infrastructure and competence, and ensure compliance with  the regulatory framework.  The purpose of activity-based budgeting (ABB) is to ensure that resource allocation is consistent with the activities of the  Agency, as described in the annual WP.  In this regard, resources engaged in ASA are re-allocated to core and horizontal operational activities in such a way that  the effort and the respective HR costs engaged in the support of the operational activities (e.g. procurement procedures  to award a contract related to a WPK/deliverables) are attributed to the latter.  While the Commission job screening methodology used for benchmarking resources employed across EU agencies is  looking at the HR allocated to functions and gives weight to job profiles and descriptions (operational, neutral, administra- tion), the ABB concept allocates the administrative and support resources according to their contribution to the Agency’s  work. Therefore the figures in following tables refer to the administration and support resources necessary to ensure the  smooth operation of the Agency, with focus on the strategic as well as day-to-day management of the Agency and com- pliance with the legal and regulatory framework (e.g. risk management, internal controls, engagement with the CoA and  IAS, statutory reporting).  NB: Full time equivalents (FTE) and costs of activities are reported on ABB basis. Costs of activities, ABB values cover also  costs including salaries.  6.2.1 Summary of core operational activities  Core operational activities (Strategic objectives 1 to 4) Operational  activities — FTEs  Total cost of  activities — ABB  SO1.

Security (ENISA) intends to carry out during 2016 and an associated multiannual planning for the years 2017 and 2018.  The work programme (WP) in its current state has been updated based on the feedback received from the European  Commission (EC) and the Member States (MS) in August 2015 and covers also the changes of the ad hoc group meetings  of May and September 2015. The initial draft was built on the conclusions of the ENISA strategic management board (MB)  meeting of October 2014, updated with the feedback received from permanent stakeholders group (PSG) of November  2014 and addresses the recommendations of the two ad hoc group meetings that took place in November and December,  respectively, 2014.  The multiannual planning component has been derived from the ENISA Strategy document, which has been developed  together with the ENISA MB. As such, the planning is based on four strategic objectives (SO) (which are presented in sec- tion 3.1). This approach ensures that future ENISA WPs reflect the SO of the agency.  1.1 Conventions Terms and acronyms used in this document are listed in the acronyms section.  Throughout this WP and all associated documentation, ENISA uses the phrase ‘capacity building’ to refer to those activ- ities that increase the preparedness of the relevant stakeholder communities to recognise and respond to cybersecurity  incidents. Although the ENISA regulation refers to ‘capability building’, the use of the term ‘capacity building’ is more  prevalent throughout the cybersecurity community and ENISA therefore adopts this practice. However, in no case does  the Agency use this term to cover activities that are outside the ENISA mandate.  1 Introduction  6  1 Introduc tion  1.2  Structure of this document This document is structured as follows:  •  SO and multiannual planning. The SO and multiannual planning provide the link between the ENISA strategy docu- ment and future WPs. In this section, key goals are set for each core priority for the period 2016-2018.  •  Core operational activities 2016. This section presents the core activities for 2016, which are structured around the SO  of the agency. (Budget and resources are presented at the work package (WPK) level at the end of the document.) In  addition, this section also covers the activities supporting the core operations of ENISA, such as the provision of the MB,  executive board (EB) and PSG secretariat, national liaison officers (NLOs) and European Union relations, stakeholder  communication activities, project office, data protection officer, etc.  • Administration and support department, directorate and general management activities. This section of the docu- ment summarises the activities of the Administration and support department (ASD) and the executive director (ED).  Budget and resources requirements are presented at the end of this document.  • Summary of budget and resource allocation. Budget and resources are presented at the WPK level at the end of the  document; the budget and the resource requirements for the ASD are also summarised at the end of this document.  • Annex for financing decision. The annex of this document provides a table which covers budget and resources which  are planned to be used for procurement purposes and for financing decisions.  1.3 Key goal indicators Key goal indicator (KGI) is a term that refers to pre-set indicators of process objectives (goals) that indicates what should  be achieved by a process (it defines an objective). Metrics used must be measurable. KGIs provide a measure of what has  to be accomplished in the attempt to respond to the question ‘are we doing the right things?’  While the key performance indicators (KPIs) show how well the processes work, KGIs show how well the results and goals  are being achieved.  In this WP document, the Agency proposes a number of KGIs for each WPK. Measuring the subsequent impact, however,  is a difficult and time-consuming activity, due to the fact that the impact of ENISA’s work on its stakeholder communities  is often indirect and involves a number of intermediate parties in the implementation process. This is particularly true for  those deliverables (Ds) which essentially propose recommendations to various stakeholders (these are ENISA studies).  7  Work programme 2016  v  2 Policy and legal context  ENISA situates its work in the wider context of a legal and policy environment as pointed out below.

planning  Strategic objectives 2016-2018  The strategic objectives (SO) originate from the ENISA strategy document.  • SO1. To develop and maintain a high level of expertise of European Union (EU) actors, taking into account evolutions  in network and information security (NIS).  • SO2. To assist the Member States (MS) and the EU institutions and bodies in enhancing capacity building throughout  the EU.  • SO3. To assist the MS and the EU institutions and bodies in developing and implementing the policies necessary to  meet the legal and regulatory requirements of network and information security.  • SO4.

The SO, as mentioned in the previous section are as follows.  • SO1. To develop and maintain a high level of expertise of EU actors, taking into account evolutions in NIS. • SO2. To assist the MS and the EU institutions and bodies in enhancing capacity building throughout the EU. • SO3. To assist the MS and the EU institutions and bodies in developing and implementing the policies necessary to  meet the legal and regulatory requirements of NIS. • SO4. To enhance cooperation both between the MS of the EU and between related NIS communities.  4.1 SO1. To develop and maintain a high level of expertise of  European Union actors, taking into account evolutions in  network and information security  SO1 aims to develop and maintain a high level of expertise of EU actors, taking into account evolutions in network and in- formation security (NIS). This SO covers the threat landscape and risk assessment, including new technologies and specific  areas such as smart grids and e-health as well as information sharing and good practices and recommendations for critical  information infrastructure protection (CIIP).  4 Core operational  ac tivit ies  14  List of Work packages and short description  • WPK1.1. Improving the expertise related to critical information infrastructures  In this Work package (WPK) ENISA aims to develop good practices on emerging smart critical infrastructures (3) and servic- es. This work will provide smart critical information infrastructure and service providers and developers with good security  and resilience practices when designing, developing and deploying such services in order to minimise the exposure of  such network and services to all relevant cyberthreat categories.  • WPK1.2. NIS threats landscape analysis  Ensuring adequate levels of protection for modern IT systems in any context requires recognising and adapting to changes  in the evolving threat environment. Whilst it is clearly not possible to predict all future threats (security practices have  often been dramatically changed as a result of so called ‘black swan’ events, which are notoriously difficult to predict), it is  possible to predict the evolution of certain threats with a reasonable degree of accuracy based on past data.  ENISA can support its stakeholders by compiling existing data on threat evolution and tailoring this data to the needs of  specific stakeholder communities. The approach will be to cover threats across all sectors, whilst identifying specificities  particular to particular communities in line with the goals of the WP. This is a more scalable approach than carrying out  threat analysis directly.  • WPK1.3. Research and development, innovation  Although there is state-of-the-art research in Europe in the field of NIS, and this area is extensively supported by Euro- pean-funded programmes, research is usually not focused on the aspects where NIS policies need available technologies  to move forward on their implementation. ENISA aims in this WPK to contribute to the various consultations launched by  the Commission in the area of NIS. Such consultations may be conducted in the context of setting the research priorities  for future calls for proposals or in the context policy initiatives launched or about to be launched by the Commission.  Furthermore, during 2016 ENISA will prepare a set of recommendations on aligning research programmes with policy in  the area of NIS.  4.1.1 WPK1.1. Improving the expertise related to critical information  infrastructures  Desired impact  • By 2017, national authorities in at least five MS use ENISA’s recommendations on smart cars and intelligent road  systems.  • By 2017, national authorities in at least five MS use ENISA’s recommendations on smart health devices, services and  infrastructures.  • By 2017, national authorities in at least five MS use ENISA’s recommendations on smart airports.  Description of tasks  In this WPK ENISA aims to develop good practices on emerging smart critical infrastructures and services using the con- cept of the internet of things (IoT) to deliver new, innovative business models and services.  (3) An infrastructure can be defined as smart when investments in human and social capital and traditional (transport) and modern (ICT)  communication infrastructure support sustainable economic development and a high quality of life, with wise management of natural  resources, through participatory action and engagement.  Work programme 2016  15  The reports will provide smart critical information infrastructure and service providers and developers with good security  and resilience practices when designing, developing and deploying such services in order to minimise the exposure of  such network and services to all relevant cyberthreat categories. This builds on previous work of ENISA in the area of  smart cities (WP 2015), smart grids (WP 2012-2015) and intelligent transportation systems (WP 2015).  The main areas of work of this WPK are as follows.  • Smart cars and intelligent road systems (not including public transportation means). ENISA, in cooperation with na- tional competent authorities, will identify smart car and vehicle manufacturers and operators and will take stock  of cybersecurity risks and challenges introduced by the use of IoT. The Agency will then develop good practices for  private and public stakeholders (e.g. national competent authorities).  • Smart health services and infrastructures. ENISA will identify e-health critical service providers (e.g. hospitals,  e-health cloud providers, insurance companies, smart laboratories) and will take stock of major cybersecurity risks  and challenges introduced by the use of IoT. The Agency will then develop good practices for both private as well as  public stakeholders (e.g. national competent authorities).  • Smart airports including supply chain integrity. ENISA will identify major airports that develop and operate smart ser- vices and take stock of the security challenges arising from the usage of these services. The Agency will then develop  good practices for airports and relevant public authorities that address these challenges.  • These emerging areas are selected based on their criticality for citizens and the economy. The Agency expects these  particular sectors and services to benefit the most from the wide adoption of IoT and machine to machine (M2M)  technologies. The early adoption of these good practices will boost trust and confidence of potential users of such  infrastructures and pave the way for the wide deployment of them. In this way ENISA will help EU industry to become  more competitive and innovative.  For each area ENISA will identify all relevant public and private stakeholders, engage them in working groups and jointly  take stock of and analyse the current situation in terms of cybersecurity and resilience giving emphasis on communication  security. The Agency will also identify EU and national-funded projects in the area of IoT and M2M communication, liaise  with them, analyse their findings and deliverables, and further engage them in corresponding expert groups. Special em- phasis will be given to the resilience and robustness of such smart critical information infrastructure and services.  Based on the consultation with stakeholders and desktop analysis and research, ENISA will develop good practices and  propose baseline security requirements targeted at EU and national policymakers, operators and manufacturers.  Outcomes and deadlines  D1: Good practices on the security and resilience of smart cars and intelligent road systems (report and a workshop, Q4,  2016). D2: Good practices on the security and resilience of smart health services and infrastructures (report and a workshop, Q4,  2016). D3: Good practices on the security and resilience of smart airports (report and a workshop, Q4, 2016).  Stakeholder impact  • Identify NIS issues and challenges in the areas mentioned above. • Develop good practices that stakeholders could use to either improve their current operations or develop more se-  cure systems and services. • Issue-targeted recommendations to policymakers and MS and work with them to address them in the most practical  and cost-effective way.  4 Core operational  ac tivit ies  16  Legal base and policy context  • ENISA regulation Article 3, in particular 3.1(c) (ii) and (iii) on promoting and sharing best practice, Article 3.4 on inde- pendent conclusions, guidance and advice.  • CIIP action plan 2009 and 2011. • Digital agenda 2010. • European strategy for cybersecurity. • Cloud computing strategy. • Council Resolution of 18 December 2009 on a collaborative European approach to network and information security  (2009/C 321/01). • Internal security strategy for the European Union. • Commission communication — ‘Smart grids: from innovation to deployment’, COM(2011) 202 final of 12 April 2011. • EC Recommendations on preparations for the roll-out of smart metering systems.  4.1.2 WPK1.2. Network and information security threats landscape analysis  Desired impact  • In 2016 at least 15 companies and five Member States participate in the ENISA stakeholder groups established to  perform the work.  • By 2017 produced results are referenced by at least 500 stakeholders in the area of threat/risk assessment. • By 2017 produced results are downloaded by at least 10 000 individuals.  Description of tasks  Objectives:  • To develop the current cyberthreat landscape. • Collect, collate and analyse existing publicly available material on threats, risks, trends and emerging technologies  application areas. • Build synergies with and seeking input from the computer emergency response team for the EU institutions, bodies  and agencies (CERT-EU), EU institutions, national bodies, industry and agencies. • Liaise with experts/organisations to conduct detailed threat assessments in specific sectors/areas. Deliver informa-  tion that can be fed to other upcoming initiatives, for example in the areas of research, standardisation, etc. • Further enhance ENISA capabilities in information collection, analysis and dissemination by adopting practices that  are (partially) tool-based. This will allow ENISA to import/export available data. • Achieve a more complete coverage of the threat analysis life-cycle by adding additional elements such as attack vec-  tors or classification schemes for cyberthreats (i.e. taxonomies). • Develop practical, scenario-based advice on how threat information can flow into risk assessments.  The main goal of this WPK is to provide a comprehensive compilation of cyberthreats based on publicly available infor- mation. This is being done by means of top threats that are assessed by analysing collected information. Threat informa- tion contains strategic and tactical information on threats and it gives references to detailed documents describing the  cyberthreat. Moreover, it provides information on threat agents. Threat information is then extrapolated to emerging  technology areas. Based on some assessed/assumed vulnerabilities in those areas, we provide possible threat exposure  data for those areas.  Another module within this WPK is the performance of dedicated assessments in some areas of particular interest to our  stakeholders, usually with an emerging character. In the past years, for example, ENISA has performed assessments in the  areas of smart grids, smart homes and internet infrastructure. With this kind of work we show the exposure of assets from  one sector to cyberthreats. We then analyse existing good practices and show how this exposure can be reduced, while  we identify gaps in existing practices.  Work programme 2016  17  All the types of information provided aim to support decision-makers in all kind of organisations to understand the threat  landscape and to make informed decisions regarding cybersecurity. Another target group are security professionals who  wish to be informed about the threat landscape and who are interested in having a neutral yet comprehensive list of cy- berthreats together with relevant publications/resources.  In 2016, ENISA would like to expand the scope of the threat landscape to include information on attack vectors and also to  provide useful information on various classification schemes for threat-related information (taxonomies). Moreover, ENI- SA would like to provide information on how cyberthreats target assets and what practices are available to protect these  assets. This information will be derived from the specific sector assessments and other relevant ENISA activities and will  be made public to interested organisations/individuals. Finally, more effective dissemination methods, eventually using  a specialised web portal will be accounted for.  Outcomes and deadlines  Based on the tasks described above, the following outcomes and deliverables are envisaged.  D1: Annual threat analysis/landscape report (Q4, 2016). D2: Assessments on two key technology/application areas (governments, small to medium‑sized enterprises (SMEs), etc.)  (Q4, 2016).  Stakeholder impact  The ENISA threat landscape is a document used by Member States and security experts worldwide to assess their expo- sure to threats and/or risks.  The primary beneficiaries of this WPK will be policymakers, organisations from the public and private sectors, but also NIS  security experts who will receive integrated and consolidated information about the European NIS threat landscape and  how it is evolving.  • Public and private organisations: other MS agencies, EC3, various governmental agencies. • EU Commission: Directorate-General (DG) Communications Networks, Content and Technology, DG Informatics and  DG Internal market, Industry, Entrepreneurhip and SMEs. • NIS experts: various experts willing to receive consolidated information about cyberthreats, cyberthreat agents, at-  tack patterns and emerging trends. • Power users, SMEs.  Public and private organisations may capitalise on the ENISA output to propose innovative R & D activities, input ENISA  information into their own decision support and assessment processes. This will facilitate the development of secure  products or services.  Detailed assessments help organisations to understand threat exposure within a specific sector/area. Moreover, it pro- vides information on available good practices to mitigate resulting risks.  Legal base and policy context  • ENISA regulation, Article 3, particularly 3.1(b)(i) and 3.1(c)(v). • The cybersecurity strategy of the EU. • The proposal for NIS directive and digital agenda.  4 Core operational  ac tivit ies  18  4.1.3 WPK1.3. Research and development, innovation  Desired impact  • At least 10 experts from the community to participate in the validation of the results of the studies. • At least five independent high-level experts from the cryptography field to participate in the quality review and the  panel for the cryptographic challenges. • At least 50 individuals/teams participate in the cryptographic challenges. • At least six research experts and networking experts from industry to contribute to the study on security aspects of  virtualisation.  Description of tasks  ENISA will launch in 2016 a new activity, the cryptographic challenges, where the Agency will present to the public a set  of cryptographic problems which can be solved by applying cryptanalysis techniques and analytical skills. The aim of this  activity is to increase the interest and outreach of cryptography research in Europe, at all educational levels, by providing  incentives in this area. The winner of each challenge will be the first contestant(s) to submit the correct solution to ENISA  and will be awarded a symbolic prize by the Agency.  In order to ensure the quality of the questions, as well as the appeal to the audience, ENISA will be supported in the elab- oration of the different challenges by renowned cryptographers, who will also take part in the panel assessing the correct- ness of the responses. In addition, and with the goal of expanding the target audience, the challenges will be divided into  several categories with different levels of difficulty, aimed at secondary students, university graduates and cryptography  researchers and practitioners. Participation will be open to any individual or team across Europe.  As was the case in previous years, ENISA will continue to support the Commission by providing experts in the evaluations  of the calls for proposals which are published in the context of EU-funded R & D programmes. In this context, emphasis  will be given to the areas which are important to the ENISA WP as presented in this document. It should be envisaged that  ENISA may contribute up to two experts for the evaluation of calls for proposals during 2016.  Work programme 2016  19  Additionally, ENISA will prepare a set of recommendations in 2016 on aligning research programmes with policy in the  specialised area of NIS. Although there is state-of-the-art research in Europe in the field of NIS, and this area is exten- sively supported by European-funded programmes, research is usually not focused on the aspects where NIS policies  need available technologies to move forward on their implementation. ENISA will address both the research and policy  communities in order to find means to improve coordination and to facilitate good support for policy areas that rely on  a technological base.  Finally, in the context of the ENISA activities supporting research and innovation in security topics, the agency will tackle  the subject of virtualisation in 2016. Virtualisation is a concept where there is an abstraction of the physical layers of  information and communications technology (ICT) components and virtual versions are created in logical layers. It can be  applied to hardware, operating systems, data, networks, etc. One of the concerns regarding virtualisation is its security  aspects, namely if vulnerabilities could lead to a breach in the logical separation of components. However, virtualisation  is reaching a very high deployment rate nowadays; therefore more research should be done on how virtualisation can be  implemented with adequate levels of security.  In order to support the R & D in this area, ENISA will prepare a study on the security aspects of virtualisation. The study will  analyse virtualisation from an ample perspective: hardware virtualisation (local virtual machines), desktop virtualisation  (thin clients), application virtualisation (remote desktop services), etc. The report will collect existing work on this area,  propose security best practices and identify gaps that need to be covered by further research. Furthermore, the study will  focus on best practices on how to provide security by default to virtualised systems by addressing possible risk scenarios  for these kind of architectures. This will support the decision-making process regarding how to optimise the cost of im- plementing virtualised systems.  Outcomes and deadlines  Based on the tasks described above, the following outcomes and deliverables are envisaged  D1: ENISA cryptographic challenges (Q3, 2016). D2: Recommendations on aligning research programme with policy in the specialised area of NIS (Q4, 2016). D3: Study on security aspects of virtualisation (Q4, 2016).  Stakeholder impact  The direct beneficiaries of the results of this WPK will be the policymakers, framework programmes of EU-funded R & D,  standardisation bodies and the end-user organisations from public and private sectors, in particular in the areas listed  below.  • Standardisation related to NIS, privacy, cloud computing and smart grids. • Harmonisation of EU-funded research and policy initiatives. • Academic and industry research in networking innovations.  Legal base and policy context  • ENISA regulation, Article 3, particularly 3.1(d)(ii). • Council Resolution of 18 December 2009 on a collaborative European approach to network and information security  (2009/C 321/01). • European Committee for Standardisation (CEN)/European Committee for Electrotechnical Standardisation (Cene-  lec)/European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) CEN-Cenelec cybersecurity coordination group (CSCG)  White Paper No 01 Recommendations for a strategy on European cybersecurity standardisation.  4 Core operational  ac tivit ies  20  4.2 SO2. To assist the Member States and the European Union  institutions and bodies in enhancing capacity building  throughout the European Union  SO2 is designed to provide assistance to MS and EU institutions and bodies, as well as the private sector by supporting NIS  enhancement of capacity building through the EU. ENISA will work together with Member States and EU institutions to  assist them in capacity building across the EU. In particular, the Agency will work together with all relevant stakeholders  to ensure that the approach is coherent across the EU.  List of work packages and short description  • WPK2.1. Assist Member States’ capacity building  One of the main goals of this work package (WPK) is to develop and improve the activities related to the operational  security support programme. In 2016, ENISA will build upon its work in the operational security area, and will update the  impact assessment related to this area to concisely draw ‘lessons learned’ via a dialogue with relevant stakeholders, and  to adjust the activities for the coming years.  Another main goal of this WPK is to help the EU Member States and other ENISA stakeholders, such as the EU institutions,  bodies and agencies, to develop and extend the necessary capabilities in order to meet the ever-growing challenges to  secure their networks.  • WPK2.2. Support EU institutions’ capacity building  In this WPK ENISA aims to enhance the dialogue among EU institutions and support them in reinforcing their NIS capacity  building. The Agency will also improve the mechanism to provide key stakeholders with timely and high-quality responses  to NIS developments.  • WPK2.3. Assist private sector capacity building  One of the main obstacles for the implementation of wide and effective cybersecurity programmes in organisations is the  lack of a common language among managers and technical staff, which makes it difficult for the latter to transmit the cur- rent security scenario to the former. ENISA will look at best practices in Member States on how to reach the private sector  in order to increase cybersecurity awareness and skills; as well as to promote a culture of cybersecurity.  The agency will gather information on successful experiences conducted in MS directed specifically to the private sector  such as awareness campaigns, reference materials, web portals, etc.  • WPK2.4. Assist in improving the general awareness  Building on the work of WP 2015, in 2016 ENISA will move towards the implementation of the 2015 recommendations to  address opportunities for the distance-learning delivery of NIS modules to large audiences. The approach under this WPK  is to leverage existing material (courses) instead of developing new material (which is outside the scope and resources of  the Agency.  In recent years, the European Cyber Security Month (ECSM) has expanded its outreach with numerous activities in the  Member States, reaching a large number of European citizens. ENISA will continue to coordinate the ECSM in 2016.  Additionally, and in order to promote capacity building among the security community, ENISA will launch a competition  in 2016, in the form a ‘capture the flag’ challenge, named the ‘ENISA cyber challenge’. Its goal is to increase the interest  in NIS by promoting excellence in the form of competitions, as well as to gather feedback on the areas of interest for the  communities.  Work programme 2016  21  4.2.1 WPK2.1. Assist Member States’ capacity building  4.2.1.1 WPK2.1.A. Assistance in the area of operational security and NIS operational training  Desired impact  • Internal timely preparation for the upcoming activities (2017 and beyond) in the operational security support  programme.  • Support Member States in enhancing their national and governmental CSIRT baseline capabilities. • Continued CSIRT services training will be provided to a minimum of 20 participants of different organisations in five  Member States. • Improved operational practices of CSIRTs in at least 15 Member States (ongoing support with best practices  development).  Description of tasks  Objectives  • Facilitate voluntary information sharing techniques to enhance quality of collection. • Extend mutual interactions with stakeholders in MS-wide area for incident response collaboration. • Build upon successful work in the area of ‘training methodologies and impact assessment’. • Update training material for operational communities (e.g. CSIRTs). • Develop new sets of training for NIS. • Further develop and apply ENISA recommendations for baseline capabilities. • Provide technical training for MS and EU bodies.  One of the main goals of this WPK is to perform sustainable research, development and improvement of activities related  to the multiannual development for the operational security support programme.  In 2016, ENISA will build upon its work in operational security areas, it will update the impact assessment report and  adjust the roadmap from 2014. The goal is to concisely draw ‘lessons learned’ via a dialogue with relevant stakeholders,  and to adjust the roadmap of CSIRT activities for the coming years. This approach will also apply for other leader activities  of the operational community support programme (training methodologies, baseline capabilities, operational community  development, etc.).  Another main goal of this WPK is to help the EU Member States and other ENISA stakeholders, such as the EU institutions,  bodies and agencies, to develop and extend the necessary capabilities in order to meet the ever-growing challenges to  secure their networks.  Most of the activities in this WPK target maintaining and extending the collection of good practice guidelines in various  areas of operational-capability building. In addition, ENISA will continue supporting Member States in enhancing their  national and governmental CSIRT capabilities.  A special emphasis in this WPK is put on supporting operational bodies and communities (namely CSIRTs, but other com- munities where appropriate) via concrete advice (such as good practice material) and concrete actions (such as CSIRT  training).  Outcomes and deadlines  Based on the tasks described above, the following outcomes and deliverables are envisaged:  D1: Updated impact assessment/adjustment of roadmap from 2015 (Q4, 2016). D2: Follow‑up/extension of the training methodologies work from 2014/15 (Q4, 2016). D3: Update of existing training material (Q4, 2016). D4: Development of a set of new training material (Q4, 2016).  4 Core operational  ac tivit ies  22  D5: On‑request training for MS and EU bodies (Q4, 2016). D6: Good practice in incident tracking and taxonomy (Q4, 2016). D7: Annual update of baseline capabilities (report) (Q4, 2016).  Stakeholder impact  • The Commission will obtain insight and expert opinion for current and future policy efforts in the incident response  field.  • The agency will obtain insight and input for future actions for operational community programme. • Beneficiaries of this WPK will be the organisations and institutions responsible for cybersecurity incident response  in both the public and private sectors; they will be able to obtain consolidated good practice material and training  information or on-site training for cybersecurity operations.  Legal base and policy context  • ENISA regulation, Article 3, particularly 3.1.(b) and 3.1.(c). • Proposed NIS directive.  4.2.1.2 WPK2.1.B. Assistance in the area of cybersecurity strategies  Desired impact  • By 2017, 10 Member State use ENISA’s good practices on NCSS. • By 2017, 15 private organisations use ENISA’s good practices on NCSS. • By 2017, 10 Member State use ENISA’s good practices on national public–private partnerships (PPPs). • By 2017, 15 private organisations use ENISA’s good practices on national PPPs.  Description of tasks  This work package aims to help the EU MS and other ENISA stakeholders, such as the EU bodies, to develop and extend the  necessary capabilities in order to meet the ever-growing challenges of securing their networks, services and information  infrastructures.  ENISA will continue assisting EU MS to develop their capabilities in the area of NCSS. The Agency, building on previous  years’ work in this area, will assist MS to deploy its existing good practices in this area and offer targeted and focused  assistance on specific aspects of NCSS (e.g. on the evaluation of NCSS).  ENISA will also act as a facilitator in this process by bringing together MS and the private sector with varying degrees of  experience to discuss and exchange good practices, share lessons learned and identify challenges and possible solutions.  Through this interaction with the MS, ENISA will validate and update its existing NCSS good practice guide and the evalu- ation/assessment framework of NCSS.  In the area of cloud computing for e-government applications and services, ENISA will assist central and/or local govern- ments to develop their capabilities. The Agency will bring together MS with varying degrees of experience and knowledge  on cloud computing and will discuss with them the benefits, risks and challenges arising from the deployment of this  technology. Through this interaction ENISA will also be able to assist the MS in properly addressing NIS matters when they  deploy cloud computing by using the existing ENISA good practice guide and security framework. The Agency will also use  this interaction with stakeholders to update the status of cloud adoption in the MS.

Assistance in the area of privacy and trust  Desired impact  • At least five data protection authorities (DPA) and 10 large EU data controllers to use the personal data breaches  severity assessment tool.  Description of tasks  ENISA will support Member States in their own decision-making process, by providing advice and referencing the appro- priate ENISA studies in the area of privacy and trust. This will be done on an on-demand basis. The agency will focus on  providing appropriate tools that facilitate Member State implementation of the provisions set out in the trust Services  regulation and the proposed data protection regulation. These activities will be conducted, as in previous years, in close  collaboration with the supervisory bodies of the MS  Specifically, in the area of personal data breaches, ENISA will continue to enhance and promote the adoption of the data  breach severity assessment tool the Agency developed in 2015. This tool, which has been implemented in close collabora- tion with several Member State DPAs, aims to provide a coherent framework for assessing data breach severity across EU  MS. In 2016, ENISA will continue to support DPAs to adopt the proposed tool and to perform impact assessment exercises  on various breach scenarios.  4 Core operational  ac tivit ies  24  Outcomes and deadlines  Based on the tasks described above, the following outcomes and deliverables are envisaged.  D11: On‑request support for MS decision‑making in the areas of privacy and trust (Q4, 2016).  Stakeholder impact  The direct beneficiaries of the results of this work will be the MS DPA and Article 29 Working Party, which will receive ad- vice and a series of proposed tools aimed to support them in the implementation of the European regulations in the areas  of privacy and trust. These activities will also facilitate the harmonised adoption of the European regulatory framework  in these fields.  Legal base and policy context  • ENISA regulation, Article 3, particularly 3.1.(b).(i) and 3.1.(c).(v). • Cybersecurity strategy of the European Union. • Data protection directive 95/46/EC. • Commission Regulation (EU) No 611/2013 of 24 June 2013 on the measures applicable to the notification of personal  data breaches under Directive 2002/58/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council on privacy and electronic  communications.  • Proposal for a general data protection regulation.  4.2.2 WPK2.2. Support European Union institutions’ capacity building  4.2.2.1 WPK2.2.A. Information notes on NIS: production and review mechanisms (‘info notes’)  Desired impact  • In 2017 improve information flows regarding NIS issues between the EU institutions. • In 2017 improved mechanism for producing and distributing of info notes. • At least two EU bodies and five public stakeholders will receive the timely information on NIS incidents and significant  developments in the field.  Description of tasks  Objectives  • Improve the mechanism that will allow the Agency to provide timely and high-quality responses to NIS developments. • Timely information provided to key stakeholders on NIS incidents and on significant developments in the field.  In the case of NIS issues and occurrences that reach a certain level of public and media attention it is crucial that the  Agency, where appropriate in collaboration with EU institutions and bodies, e.g. CERT-EU, provide a more balanced set  of information about the issues and occurrences. This is why ENISA will continue to provide high-quality responses to NIS  developments. Based on the practice and experience in 2014 and 2015, the Agency will review and adjust the mechanism  for preparing and producing info notes.  ENISA’s intention is to continue providing info notes in a timely manner as a reliable and continuous service to its stake- holders. The overall goal for each note should be to highlight fundamental facts and the shortcomings behind specific NIS  issues and occurrences, concentrating on how such shortcomings can be addressed by improvements to processes and  infrastructure, in order to give advice to its key stakeholders (in accordance with the Agency mandate) and to provide an  independent and ‘calm’ opinion. Notes will only be made public if the topic is not an ongoing incident, and if the note is  based on public information.  Work programme 2016  25  Outcomes and deadlines  Based on the tasks described above, the following outcomes and deliverables are envisaged.  D1: Review and adjust mechanism for production of info notes (Q1‑4, 2016). D2: Restricted and public info notes on NIS (Q1‑Q4, 2016).  Stakeholder impact  • Improved collaboration with EU bodies (e.g. CERT-EU) concerning timely and high-quality info notes on NIS incidents  and significant developments in the field.  • Timely information provided to key stakeholders on NIS incidents and on significant developments in the field.  Legal base and policy context  • ENISA regulation, Article 3, particularly 3.1(b) and 3.1(c).  4.2.2.2 WPK.2.2.B. Reinforcement of the NIS of Union institutions, bodies and agencies  Desired impact  • ENISA’s expertise regarding the MS NIS capacity development is also to be offered to EU institutions, agencies and  bodies (hereinafter: ‘EU institutions’), in cooperation with CERT-EU.  • Enhanced knowledge of EU institutions regulations, policies, procedures related to their NIS. • Identification of well-functioning practices that could be disseminated to all or relevant EU institutions, as well as  information concerning critical weaknesses that should be addressed. • Identification of future actions that ENISA could initiate in order to further reinforce the NIS of EU institutions.  4 Core operational  ac tivit ies  26  Description of tasks  In this WPK ENISA aims to enhance the dialogue among European institutions and support them in reinforcing their NIS.  In 2016, concrete actions are planned.  • Identifying and liaising with all relevant stakeholders within European institutions and bodies. • In cooperation with all relevant European institutions and bodies, taking stock of and initiating an analysis of all exist-  ing regulations, policies, procedures and practices of all EU institutions related to their NIS.  Through stocktaking and analysis, ENISA will identify overlaps and gaps between all these regulations and policies. These  findings could also be discussed with all relevant stakeholders from EU bodies, EU MS and even the private sector. That  might pave the way for a permanent strategic dialogue among all European institutions and bodies on the future of NIS  policy in the EU.  This dialogue will result in important recommendations that would allow the simplification of policies, reduction of over- laps, identification of synergies, creation of awareness about NIS challenges and even proposals for new actions to ad- dress identified gaps. That would help European institutions and bodies to better focus their efforts and properly use their  resources to meet the needs of EU MS and the private sector. ENISA is liaising and will continue to liaise, for this purpose  with CERT-EU, the incident response team for the EU institutions. The expertise of CERT-EU on the reactive dimension of  NIS of the EU Institutions will strongly benefit this process.  Considering the sensitiveness of the information that ENISA might be provided with by European institutions, deliverables  will be restricted in distribution.  Building on this work ENISA will address in future work programmes the setting up of a European institution NIS contin- gency plan, the organisation of dedicated EU institution cyber incidents exercises, and the launch of awareness-raising  initiatives.  Outcomes and deadlines  Based on the tasks described above, the following outcomes and deliverables are envisaged.  D3: Restricted. Upon request, support the assessment of existing policies/procedures/practices on NIS within EU institu‑ tions (workshop, meetings, Q1‑4, 2016).  Stakeholder impact  Dialogue among EU institutions on their NIS will be facilitated. EU institutions and bodies will:  • further benefit from each other’s best practices on NIS. • obtain insight and expert advice on how to reinforce their NIS. • benefit from the establishment of cooperation between CERT-EU and ENISA. • obtain insight and expert opinion on NIS field. • better understand the synergies between existing policies, regulations and procedures. • better understand the overlaps between existing policies, regulations and procedures. • better understand how to address gaps in existing policies, regulations and procedures.  Legal base and policy context  • According to Article 3(b)iii of ENISA’s 2013 regulation, the Agency shall […] assist the EU institutions, bodies, offices  and agencies in their efforts to develop the prevention, detection and analysis of and the capability to respond to  NIS problems and incidents, in particular by supporting the operation of a computer emergency response team […]  for them.  Work programme 2016  27  • In its conclusions on the European cybersecurity strategy (11357/13 of 21 June 2013), the Council called upon all EU  institutions, in cooperation with ENISA, to take the necessary actions to ensure their own cybersecurity, by reinforc- ing their NIS according to the appropriate standards.  4.2.3 WPK2.3. Assist private sector capacity building  Desired impact  • At least five MS and five private sector stakeholders contribute to the production of the guidelines for MS to reach  the private sector through cybersecurity awareness dissemination activities.  • At least 15 private sector stakeholders coming from different MS, sectors of activity and size participate in the elabo- ration of the recommendations for ICT security staff on improving management level cybersecurity awareness.  Description of tasks  ENISA will look at best practices in Member States on how to reach the private sector in order to increase cybersecurity  awareness and skills; as well as to promote a culture of cybersecurity. The agency will gather information on successful  experiences conducted in MS such as awareness campaigns, reference materials, web portals, etc.  The agency will focus on recommendations on how to improve cybersecurity awareness at the management level. Indeed,  one of the main obstacles for the implementation of wide and effective cybersecurity programmes in organisations is that  there is a lack of a common language among managers and technical staff, which makes it difficult for the latter to transmit  the current security scenario to the former.  The report will analyse how to tackle and overcome this culture dialogue issue. By taking stock from existing guidelines  in Member States and international security organisations, the agency will try to support security managers and profes- sionals with references to existing guidelines on how to engage the senior level support for cybersecurity. The agency will  propose best practices focusing exclusively in areas where existing gaps in reference materials have been detected.  Outcomes and deadlines  Based on the tasks described above, the following outcomes and deliverables are envisaged.  D1: Recommendations for creating a cybersecurity culture and improving management‑level cybersecurity awareness  (Q4, 2016).  Stakeholder impact  • The direct beneficiaries of the results of this work will be MS and EU companies, from all sectors and sizes, which will  receive recommendations on how to improve cybersecurity awareness and create a cybersecurity culture, especially  from an organisational level and managerial level.  Legal base and policy context  • ENISA regulation, Article 3, particularly 3.1(c)(iv) and 3.1(c)(v). • ENISA stakeholder strategy. • Cybersecurity strategy of the European Union (section 2.1). • Commission communication — ‘A digital agenda for Europe’, COM(2010) 245 final of 19 May 2010.  4 Core operational  ac tivit ies  28  4.2.4 WPK2.4. Assist in improving general awareness  Desired impact  • Further develop an effective work process to involve more universities and certification providers. • At least 50 individuals from MS participate in the ENISA cyber challenge. • Representatives from the EU 28 MS and five partner countries participate in ECSM and the release of general NIS  messages for citizens. • At least five international stakeholders collaborate, for better coordination, in the ECSM. • At least 10 experts from the community participate in reviewing the contents of the citizens’ portal.  Description of tasks  The Agency published in 2014 a report Roadmap for NIS education programmes in Europe and one of the recommenda- tion stated the following; massive online open courses (MOOCs) may offer opportunities for the distance learning delivery  of NIS modules to large audiences. Building on the work of WP 2015 this year ENISA will move towards the implementa- tion of the 2015 recommendations. It is of worth to note that also in this case the approach under this WPK is to leverage  existing material (courses) instead of developing new material (which is outside the scope and resources of the Agency. It  is within the scope of the work on NIS education and it fully involves the organisations from Member States which already  developed a MOOC and would like to further share their work with the community.  Additionally, and in order to promote capacity building among the security community, in 2016 ENISA will launch a com- petition in the form a ‘capture the flag’ challenge, named ‘ENISA cyber challenge’. It will be aimed at university students  from technical schools and security practitioners from the industry. Its goal will be to increase the interest in NIS in these  communities by promoting excellence in the form of competitions, as well as to gather feedback on the areas of interest  for the communities. In order to do so, ENISA will try to achieve large participation among individuals from different MS.  As one of its main activities in the area of improving public awareness, ENISA will continue to coordinate the ECSM. In re- cent years, the ECSM has expanded its outreach with numerous activities in the Member States, reaching a large number  of European citizens. In 2016, the ECSM will be further developed following its basic principles, namely:  • support the multi-stakeholder governance approach, • encourage common public-private activities, • assess the impact of activities, optimising and adapting to new challenges.  In addition, ENISA conducted in 2015 a feasibility study and a pilot project for a web portal that allows European citizens  to recognise and use tools for online privacy and security. In particular, the portal lists existing up-to-date and trustworthy  open source/freeware tools that can be easily applied by non-expert users who wishes to protect themselves online (e.g.  in web browsing, email, instant messaging, e-payment systems). To ensure a neutral perspective, tools are selected after  the review of an independent panel of experts.  In 2016, ENISA aims to promote the use of technical tools that enhance user privacy and data protection. It does so by  publishing relevant content, focusing on specific citizens groups, as well as disseminating relevant information through  community portals and online media in order to reach out to more parties. Moreover, effort will be put into supporting  users in recognising and selecting privacy tools in cooperation with other relevant stakeholders (DPA, industry, non-gov- ernmental organisations (NGOs), etc.).  Outcomes and deadlines  Based on the tasks described above, the following outcomes and deliverables are envisaged.  D1: ENISA report on ‘massive open online courses (MOOCs) for NIS needs’ (Q4, 2016). D2: ENISA cyber challenge (Q2, 2016). D3: Provide guidance and support for ECSM (dissemination material, Q4, 2016). D4: Upgrade the online privacy tools portal and involve privacy experts from different fields (dissemination material, Q4, 2016).  Work programme 2016  29  Stakeholder impact  The direct beneficiaries of the results of this work will be EU citizens, targeted by different categories, as well as end-user  organisations from public and private sectors (in particular in the area of EU NIS education). These stakeholders are ex- pected to reap the following benefits.  • Develop knowledge and corresponding ICT skills by being part of a best-practice-sharing community. • Improve and enhance contacts with stakeholders of similar interests and profiles. • Increase citizens’ awareness and governance on privacy when using online tools.  Legal base and policy context  • ENISA regulation, Article 3, particularly 3.1(c)(iv) and 3.1(c)(v). • ENISA stakeholder strategy. • Cybersecurity strategy of the European Union (Section 2.1). • Data protection directive 95/46/EC. • Proposal for a general data protection regulation.  4.3 SO3. To assist the Member States and the European Union  institutions and bodies in developing and implementing the  policies necessary to meet the legal and regulatory requirements  of network and information security  SO3 provides the framework for ENISA to assist the EU MS and the EU institutions in developing and implementing the  policies necessary to meet the legal and regulatory requirements of network and information security (NIS).  List of work packages and short description  • WPK3.1. Supporting EU policy development  The key objective of this work package (WPK) will be for ENISA to proactively contribute to the development of existing or  new EU policy initiatives (before they are launched) and assists the Commission, Member States and the private sector in  the implementation of existing policies in this area.  ENISA will achieve this objective by engaging with public and private stakeholders and leveraging its existing knowledge  and expertise in the area of secure infrastructure and services.  Another key objective of this WPK is cybersecurity standardisation. From its creation, ENISA has tracked the development  of standards in the area of NIS, maintaining close contacts and collaboration with international standardisation organisa- tions. This approach enables ENISA to keep its activities up-to-date with the latest developments as well as informing its  stakeholders on new NIS standardisation activities and to flag opportunities and/or risks as they develop.  Furthermore, ENISA will support this area, in cooperation with relevant stakeholders, by developing recommendations for  improving NIS in EU standardisation policy, providing guidelines of the possible frameworks that can be adopted in order  to achieve a harmonised scheme across MS, as well as setting recommendations for the stakeholders involved.  • WPK3.2. Supporting EU policy implementation  This WPK covers activities linked to the implementation of couple of directives and regulations (i.e. activities linked to  electronic identification and trust services (eIDAS) regulation, e-privacy directive and the proposed NIS directive) where  ENISA has been assigned a role and responsibilities and where NIS is one of the main goals or means to achieve suitable  implementation.  4 Core operational  ac tivit ies  30  Subject to its adoption, ENISA will cooperate with all EU Member States and the Commission to define the scope of the  NIS directive, the actions related to ENISA and the sectors and/or services affected. As a result of this the Agency will  then identify all relevant public and private stakeholders (e.g. competent authorities, manufacturers and operators) and  engage them in a structured dialogue on the key objectives of the NIS directive and how can be best implemented within  each sector and/or service.  ENISA work in the areas of privacy and trust has been ongoing for several years now, and the Agency has extensively  contributed to support the implementation of the personal data protection regulatory framework in many of its key  technological aspects. ENISA will continue to support the implementation of EC Regulation 611/2013 by providing assis- tance regarding technical protective measures (appropriate cryptographic protective measures) as the abovementioned  regulation requests ENISA to do.  ENISA will continue collecting and analysing annual national reports of security breaches from national regulatory author- ities (NRAs) in accordance with Article 13a of the framework directive on electronic communications. The Agency, in co- operation with experts from NRAs and the private sector (e.g. ENISA’s e-communications reference group, NIS platform.)  will analyse the national reports, compare them with previous years, identify new trends and develop good practices and  lessons learned.  Another area covered in this WPK is the support for the implementation of the Regulation (EU) No 910/2014 of the Euro- pean Parliament and of the Council of 23 July 2014 on electronic identification and trust services for electronic transac- tions in the internal market.  Trust services are a key enabler for increasing citizens’ confidence in online services, and given their nature, they require  a high level of security to ensure their integrity and reliability. ENISA has contributed extensively to the area of securing  trust services in the past by providing best practices for providers, recommendations on audit schemes, standardisation  guidance, security-breach reporting and recommendations, etc. Building on the work of 2015, in 2016 ENISA will focus on  the key areas of interest for stakeholders, where a contribution will be most useful to the community, the topics of assur- ance levels for electronic identification and security recommendations for relying parties of trust services.  4.3.1 WPK3.1. Supporting European Union policy development  4.3.1.1 WPK3.1.A. Contribution to EU policy linked to secure infrastructures and services  Desired impact  • By 2017, 15 companies and five MS competent authorities contribute to ENISA’s efforts in the area of cloud computing. • By 2017, 15 companies and five MS competent authorities contribute to ENISA’s efforts in the area of smart grids  and/or ICS-SCADA. • By 2017, 10 companies and five MS competent authorities contribute to ENISA’s efforts in the area of certification of  components and systems. • By 2017, 10 companies and five MS competent authorities contribute to ENISA’s efforts in the area of finance.  Description of tasks  In this WPK, ENISA will engage with public and private stakeholders and deploy state-of-the-art recommendations and  good practices in secure infrastructure and services with the objective of proactively contributing to the development of  existing or new EU policy initiatives (before they are launched) and assist the Commission, Member States and the private  sector in the implementation of existing policies in this area.  ENISA will achieve this objective by engaging with public and private stakeholders, by deploying existing expert groups  (e.g. the European SCADA and control systems information Exchange (EuroSCSIE)) and by leveraging its existing knowl- edge and expertise in the area of secure infrastructure and services. One of the key vehicles to deliver this is actually the  NIS platform (an EU-level PPP) but also dedicated, area-specific expert groups that develop useful insight, validate good  practices and issue practical recommendations. Whenever it is necessary ENISA will liaise with standards bodies to pro- vide its technical opinion on future standards in the areas below.  31  The main areas covered in this WPK are as follows.  EU cloud computing strategy and partnership  ENISA will continue to play an active role in the implementation of the EU’s cloud computing strategy and partnership.  The agency will provide technical advice, recommendations and information on good practices to the Commission and the  EU cloud partnership in the areas of certification, pre-commercial public procurement guidelines and incident-reporting  mechanisms. In all these areas ENISA will engage with all relevant public and private stakeholders and make sure that  these efforts properly align with EU ECP, ETSI and CEN/Cenelec initiatives.  EU smart grids and ICS-SCADA strategy  ENISA will assist the Commission, the Member States and the private sector in the implementation of the EU’s smart grid  strategy and ICS-SCADA actions. The agency, building on this existing knowledge and expertise, will provide sound techni- cal advice, recommendations and information on good practices in the area of minimum security measures for smart grids  and ICS-SCADA, certification of smart grid components, industrial IoT and incident-reporting mechanisms for national  critical industries. ENISA will engage with all relevant stakeholders, provide contributions to the Commission on policy  initiatives (e.g. EU CSS, DG Energy’s expert group 2 (EG2) and Energy expert cybersecurity platform (EECSP), CEN/Cenelec’s  M490, EuroSCSIE and distributed energy security knowledge (Densek)), and make sure that these efforts properly align  with EU’s overall smart grid policy.  Policy discussions on the certification of components and systems  ENISA will cooperate with the Commission, Member States and the private sector in order to foster EU policy discussion  regarding a European framework for the certification of components and systems. The agency will support the discussion  on the evolution of the existing initiatives. Through this, ENISA will be able to provide suggestions to key decision-makers  on the way MS and the EU should address this issue.  Work programme 2016  4 Core operational  ac tivit ies  32  EU policy on NIS matters of the finance sector  ENISA will continue its efforts in the area of the finance sector. The Agency will assist the Commission, MS competent  authorities and the private sector in the definition and implementation of the EU’s policy on NIS matters of the finance  sector. ENISA, using its knowledge and expertise in this area, will contribute to the third-party payments debate, the  risks in inter-banking transactions and secure communications debate, adoption of cloud computing by sector and the  harmonisation of audits and policies and others. ENISA will cooperate closely with relevant key stakeholders such as the  European Banking Authority (EBA), the European Central Bank (ECB) and leading financial institutions and providers to  achieve the goals in this area.  Outcomes and deadlines  D1: Contribute to EU policy in the area of cloud computing (workshops, meetings, Q1‑Q4, 2016).

Policy development and standards  Desired impact  • At least six stakeholders from policymakers, industry and research experts in NIS standardisation to contribute in  ENISA’s recommendations for improving NIS in EU standardisation policy.  Description of tasks  The new ENISA mandate gives the Agency a more proactive role in the area of standardisation. The task assigned to  ENISA by the new regulation is to support standardisation by facilitating the establishment and take-up of European and  international standards for risk management and for the security of electronic products, networks and services. A key ele- ment towards the objective of improved security standardisation is to facilitate close collaboration between policymakers,  standardisation organisations and industry. ENISA will facilitate the cooperation of stakeholders by engaging policymakers,  standardisation organisations and industry, with the aim of putting forward common strategies to enhance NIS in EU  standardisation policy.  Since 2012 ENISA has specifically participated in the creation and further work of the ETSI CEN-CENELEC Cyber Security  Coordination Group (CSCG). This will continue in 2016 and ENISA will collaborate in the activities of the CSCG and try to  further exploit synergies between the CSCG and its WP. The Agency will also involve standards bodies in the different  WPKs in as far as this is appropriate.  Furthermore, in order to enhance cooperation in this area among the different stakeholders, in 2015 ENISA conducted  a conference to align policymakers, industry and research experts in steering cybersecurity standardisation. Based on the  input from the participating experts and the ongoing collaboration with the CSCG, ENISA will further develop the work  done in 2015.  In 2016 the Agency will provide recommendations for improving NIS in EU standardisation policy and guidelines on the  possible frameworks that can be adopted in order to achieve a harmonised scheme across MS.  Outcomes and deadlines  Based on the tasks described above, the following outcomes and deliverables are envisaged:  D5: Recommendations for improving NIS in EU standardisation policy (Q4, 2016).  4 Core operational  ac tivit ies  34  Stakeholder impact  The direct beneficiaries of the results of this WPK will be the policymakers, framework programmes of EU-funded R & D,  standardisation bodies and end-user organisations from the public and private sectors, in particular in the areas of stand- ardisation related to NIS, privacy, cloud computing and smart grids.  Legal base and policy context  • ENISA regulation, Article 3, particularly 3.1(d)(i) and 3.1(d)(ii). • Council Resolution of 18 December 2009 on a collaborative European approach to network and information security  (2009/C 321/01). • CEN/Cenelec/ETSI CSCG White Paper No 01 Recommendations for a strategy on European cybersecurity  standardisation.  4.3.1.3 WPK3.1.C. Towards a digital single market for NIS and related IT products and services  Desired impact  • EU and national policymakers understand the strengths and weaknesses of the NIS and related IT sector in Europe. • EU and national policymakers understand how to develop a digital single market (DSM) for NIS and related products  and services.  Description of tasks  The aim of this WPK is to analyse how the NIS and related IT sectors can play a decisive role in a DSM at EU level. ENISA will  take stock of different market segments in the NIS and related IT areas and identify key European players having a major  market role in products, services or infrastructures.  This task should help ENISA to advise the Commission and Member States to better identify where efforts should be  placed in order to further support European NIS and related ICT industries and services in order to achieve and improve  the adequate level of diversity and trust in the EU.  The agency will form an expert group with senior experts from these private sector stakeholders and selected experts  from MS and the Commission to assess the technical competitive advantage of Europe in the area of NIS and provide  insight on how Europe could become a sustainable market player in NIS and related IT products and/or services without  setting up trade barriers or using other protectionist measures. Particular attention will be given to the DSM initiative of  the Commission and its outcomes.  The Agency will then develop useful recommendations on how Europe can support the DSM for NIS and identify the areas  and means to foster further actions.  Outcomes and deadlines  Based on the tasks described above, the following outcomes and deliverables are envisaged.  D6: Restricted.

Assist EU MS and Commission in the implementation of the NIS directive  Desired impact  • By 2017, 10 MS contribute to ENISA’s efforts for harmonised implementation of the NIS directive. • By 2017, 20 major private organisations contribute to ENISA’s efforts for harmonised implementation of the NIS  directive. • By 2018, five MS deploy ENISA’s guidelines on NIS directive in a 3 sectors/services. • By 2018, 10 private organisations deploy ENISA’s guidelines on NIS directive in a 3 sectors/services.  Description of tasks  This work package aims to help EU MS, the private sector and the Commission to implement the NIS directive.  Subject to its adoption and in alignment with the tasks and roles allocated to ENISA in this directive, the Agency will coop- erate with all EU Member States and the Commission to refine the scope of the NIS directive, the actions related to ENISA  and the sectors and/or services affected.  As a result of this the agency will then identify all relevant public and private stakeholders (e.g. competent authorities,  manufacturers and operators) and engage them in a structured dialogue on the key objectives of the NIS directive and  how it can be best implemented within each sector and/or service. Possible actions include those mentioned in the cur- rent NIS directive draft (e.g. incident reporting per sector, trusted information sharing per sector, NCSS, PPPs). Based on  the feedback from the relevant public and private stakeholders ENISA will then analyse the key actions, identify possible  implementation approaches, analyse good practices and challenges, and finally issue guidelines and recommendations on  the implementation of those NIS directive actions.  ENISA will do its utmost to achieve consistency and harmonisation among the different implementation approaches  across sectors. Emphasis will be given to applying similar approaches, concepts, frameworks, good practices, recommen- dations, parameters and/or thresholds per sector. By doing this we hope to develop an easy, consistent and affordable  implementation scheme across sectors. Such schemes would allow the proper use of exchanged information and pave the  way for consistent analysis across sectors.  ENISA will also take stock of and analyse all existing national (e.g. UK: Cyber Essential), EU and international cybersecu- rity baseline frameworks and standards. The Agency will then identify good practices and propose measures needed to  achieve minimum security measures for all the sectors defined in the NIS directive. ENISA will engage both private and  public sectors in the process to validate the findings and make sure that the end result is easy, affordable and effective.  In this effort ENISA will leverage its existing knowledge and expertise in stakeholder engagement with the public and/ or the private sector. The agency will also deploy its existing stakeholder communities such as the NIS platform, existing  national PPPs and other expert groups established by ENISA and others in different sectors. ENISA will also capitalise on its  domain knowledge and expertise in certain sectors already mentioned by the NIS directive (e.g. energy, transport, health).  The agency has already developed good practices and issued recommendations for several key actions already mentioned  by the NIS directive in a few sectors, e.g. minimum security measures for smart grids, incident-reporting schemes for  cloud computing, NCSS, national PPPs, and others. These results will become useful input in the process and enable faster  development of necessary implementation schemes.  4 Core operational  ac tivit ies  36  Outcomes and deadlines  D1: Guidelines for the implementation of mandatory incident reporting in the context of the NIS directive (report, Q4,  2016).

Work programme 2016  37  Description of tasks  ENISA work on the areas of privacy and trust has been ongoing for several years now, and the Agency has contributed  extensively to assist the implementation of the personal data protection regulatory framework in many of its key tech- nological aspects. As an example of this support, the Commission published in 2013 the Regulation 611/2013 on the  measures applicable to the notification of personal data breaches under Directive 2002/58/EC on privacy and electronic  communications. Article 4(3) of the regulation sets out that the Commission will publish an indicative list of appropriate  technological protection measures which shall render the data unintelligible to any person who is not authorised to access  it, after consultation with the Article 29 Working Party, ENISA and the European Data Protection Supervisor (EDPS).  As a core activity in supporting the protection of personal information, ENISA provided recommendations on technological  measures to protect the confidentiality, integrity and authenticity of personal data. In this respect, since 2013 ENISA has  produced a report on the appropriate technological measures to protect information and communication through the use  of cryptographic techniques. In 2016, ENISA will shift the focus of the deliverable on appropriate technological protection  measures, from algorithms to the application domain, providing guidelines on how to specifically apply existing cryptograph- ic technologies to protect privacy and trust. The study will address current and emerging technologies for data confidential- ity, integrity and authenticity; both in storage and in transit. The report aims to be a useful tool for data controllers on how  to better apply cryptography to improve the protection of personal data. ENISA will create an expert group (with represent- atives from MS) that will participate in the elaboration process of the study to maximise alignment with national guidelines.  Furthermore, ENISA will ensure continuity for the activities where the Agency has achieved high expertise in the area of  privacy, as well as introducing some emerging new topics which have become relevant for the privacy community. For  example, the Agency will carry on with its work on privacy enhancing technologies (PETs). Based on the findings of previ- ous years, the report on the evolution, newest ideas and most up-to-date features of PETs and their building blocks, will  explore the landscape of PETs and associated organisational measures, their specific applications and how they can be  used to fulfil the legal requirements. The report will empower the competent authorities in the Member States to detail  their own guidelines for their respective communities. Furthermore, the report will bring the different levels of maturity  of technologies into the picture. This will help the EU and MS funding agencies to call for targeted R & D efforts to improve  the overall availability of PETs.  Another area where ENISA will work in 2016 is the protection of personal data and security in electronic applications  (i.e. healthcare). As new mechanisms and tools for online information processing appear (including storage, merging and  correlation of data), in particular with the use of cloud services and smart mobile devices, the risk of exposure of sensitive  medical data seriously increases. Therefore, using — among others — the results of the Agency’s 2015 study on big data,  ENISA will focus especially on the new and/or emerging means of personal data processing in online and mobile applica- tions and the threats and risks that these create for these data. In particular, ENISA will provide a state-of-the-art analysis  of the aforementioned risks and will propose a list of technical and organisational measures for managing and mitigating  them. The result of the overall work will aim primarily at supporting users of online and mobile applications to protect  their personal data, as well as data controllers who offer relevant services to citizens.  Finally, ENISA will host in 2016 the fourth edition of the Annual Privacy Forum (APF). The APF aims to provide an open  forum where policymakers, researches and industry experts can discuss the key topics and new challenges in the field  of data protection. Already in its fourth edition, the APF has become a reference conference for the privacy community  in Europe. The objective of the Agency for 2016, as in previous years, will be to address the topics which are of current  interest for the privacy community, in order to reach the maximum number of relevant participants, representing different  stakeholder communities across Member States.  Regarding new activities, the agency conducted in 2015 a Europe wide survey on new directions on securing personal  data, with the aim of gathering stock on the opinions of relevant experts in the area of privacy. Based on the results of  this study, in 2016 ENISA will implement guidelines for data controllers on technological measures for securing the auto- mated processing of personal data. This study will cover best practices and specific recommendations for the appropriate  protection of personal data in automated systems. The report will focus especially on SMEs and other small-scale data  controllers, where there is a currently a lack of documentation, as well as a high demand for guidelines to mitigate the risk  of breaches and to achieve compliance with existing regulations.  4 Core operational  ac tivit ies  38  Outcomes and deadlines  Based on the tasks described above, the following outcomes and deliverables are envisaged.  D5: Evolution and state of the art of privacy enhancing technologies and their building blocks (Q4, 2016). D6: 2016 edition of the report on appropriate technological protection measures to preserve privacy and trust (Q4, 2016). D7: Data protection and security in online and mobile applications (i.e. healthcare) (Q4, 2016). D8: Annual Privacy Forum (Q2, 2016). D9: Guidelines for data controllers on securing the automated processing of personal data (Q4, 2016).  Stakeholder impact  By supporting the development of guidelines for a broad range of privacy topics in the light of the new data protection  regulation, the direct beneficiaries of the results of this WPK will be policymakers, supervisory bodies, research organisa- tion and data controllers.  Legal base and policy context  • ENISA regulation, Article 3, particularly 3.1(a)(ii), 3.1(b)(i) and 3.1(c)(ii). • Cybersecurity strategy of the European Union. • Data protection directive 95/46/EC.  Work programme 2016  39  • Commission Regulation (EU) No 611/2013 of 24 June 2013 on the measures applicable to the notification of personal  data breaches under Directive 2002/58/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council on privacy and electronic  communications.  • Proposal for a general data protection regulation.  4.3.2.3 WPK3.2.C. Assistance in the implementation of mandatory incident‑reporting schemes  Desired impact  • By 2017, 15 Member States make direct use of the outcomes of Article 13a work by explicitly referencing it or by  adopting it at national level.  • By 2017, 10 major e-communication providers across the EU comply with ENISA’s minimum security measures. • By 2017, 15 Member States contribute to ENISA’s efforts on harmonised implementation of Article 19 of eIDAS  regulation.  Description of tasks  This work package focuses on assisting regulatory authorities in the implementation of EU regulations related to manda- tory incident reporting. It builds on successful work done in this area over the years in the area of Article 13a.  The main tasks of this work package are to support the following.  • NRAs and EU MS on the implementation of Article 13a (security-breach notification) and Article 4 (personal data  breach notification) and developing synergies among them.  • NRAs and EU MS on the implementation of Article 19 of new regulation on eIDAS. • ENISA will continue collecting and analysing annual, national reports of security breaches from NRAs in accordance  with Article 13a of the framework directive on electronic communications. The Agency, in cooperation with experts  from NRAs and the private sector (e.g. ENISA’s e-communications reference group, NIS platform), will analyse the  national reports, compare them with previous years, identify new trends and develop good practices and lessons  learned. The Agency will select two major root causes of incidents, deeply analyse them and issue good practices and  recommendations to NRAs and e-communication providers that would allow them to better protect themselves from  such root causes in the future.  ENISA will cooperate with electronic communications providers and MS competent authorities (e.g. NRAs and DPAs) to  address security, privacy and confidentiality issues in an integrated and holistic manner. In that respect the Agency, in co- operation with the Commission, will continue its efforts towards a harmonised reporting scheme for the e-communication  providers that would address both Article 4 and Article 13a requirements.  ENISA will continue its efforts to develop common guidelines for a cost-effective mandatory security-breach notification  scheme implementing Article 19 of eIDAS regulation. The Agency, building on the Forum of European supervisory author- ities for electronic signatures (FESA) and other related public and private stakeholder groups, will bring all competent  authorities of the EU together to discuss the scope of the scheme, the services affected, the impact of the incidents  reported (e.g. parameters and thresholds), the reporting attributes, the reporting modalities, the reporting tools and oth- ers. ENISA will also engage in a dialogue with the relevant private sector entities and relevant standardisation bodies (e.g.  ETSI) about the different options available in order to better understand their needs and requirements and work towards  building a consistent and cost-effective schema. In this context ENISA will also try to exploit all possible implementation  and conceptual synergies with Article 13a and Article 4.  Outcomes and deadlines  Based on the tasks described above, the following outcomes and deliverables are envisaged.  D10: Annual incident analysis report (Article 13a) (workshop and report, Q3, 2016).  4 Core operational  ac tivit ies  40  D11: Analysis of major root causes — good practices and recommendations for NRAs and e‑communication providers  (workshop and report, Q4, 2016). D12: Contribute to EU policy in the area of electronic communications sector (workshops, meetings, Q1‑Q4, 2016).  D13: Engaging eIDAS competent authorities and private sector in the implementation of Article 19 (workshops, meetings,  Q1‑Q4, 2016). D14: Guidelines for mandatory incident reporting in the context of eIDAS (report, Q4, 2016).  Stakeholder impact  Telecommunications sector  • Supervisory authorities will have practical references and technical guidelines to implement the legislation. • Within the area of Article 13a, the industry, NRAs and the Commission will be able to develop a better understanding  of the significant incidents at European level as well as a comparison with earlier years and recommendations, which  will support mitigation decisions and actions.  • The Commission (DG Communications Networks, Content and Technology, DG Migration and Home Affairs and DG  Justice and Consumers) will achieve harmonisation of incident reporting, breach notifications and security measures,  following international standards and can in this way forego further detailing of the legislative text.  • Industry (network providers, internet service providers (ISPs), cloud providers, etc.) will be able to adopt a single  framework of incident reporting/breach notification and security measures, so there is a level playing field across the  EU MS and no complications for working across borders.  • Cooperate with Member States and private sector to develop an e-communications networks resilience. • ISPs and internet exchange points (IXPs) will be able to better use the existing technology to better serve customers  during crises and offer related services.  Regulation on electronic identification and trusted services  • NRAs and DPAs will be able to implement an efficient reporting scheme which is very similar to the Article 13a  scheme currently in place, and in this way lay the basis for a coherent and holistic picture of security incidents across  key service providers.  • A single reporting scheme will allow trust service providers to operate more easily across borders, effectively paving  the way for a single market of trust service providers across the EU. In turn this facilitates cross-border online servic- es, such as e-commerce and e-government.  Legal base and policy context  • ENISA regulation Article 3, in particular Articles 3.1(a), 3.1(b) on capacity building and 3.1(c). • Cybersecurity strategy of the European Union: Council Resolution of 18 December 2009. • CIIP action plan 2009 and 2011. • Internal security strategy for the European Union.  4.3.2.4 WPK3.2.D. Support for policy implementation in the area of electronic identification and  trust services  Desired impact  • At least six stakeholders from trust service providers, online services providers, conformity assessment bodies and  supervisory authorities contribute in ENISA guidelines and best practices recommendations regarding electronic  identification and trust services.  • At least 10 experts from the community participate in the validation of the results of the studies.  Work programme 2016  41  Description of tasks  The main objective of this WPK is to continue to support the large-scale adoption of secure electronic identification means  and trust services across Europe. Trust services are a key enabler for increasing citizens’ confidence in online services,  and given their nature, they require a high level of security to ensure their integrity and reliability. ENISA has contributed  extensively to the area of securing trust services in the past by providing best practices for providers, recommendations  on audit schemes, standardisation guidance, security-breach reporting recommendations, etc.  From the policy perspective, a milestone in this area was achieved with the adoption of the Regulation (EU) No 910/2014  of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 July 2014 on electronic identification and trust services for electronic  transactions in the internal market. ENISA aims to support the implementation of the regulation by further focusing on  the security aspects related to trust services providers.  In order to identify key aspects and gaps this area, in 2015 ENISA launched, in collaboration with the EC, a forum that  brings together communities, namely: trust service providers from the EU trusted lists, conformity assessment bodies and  supervisory authorities. The forum has proven to be a useful tool for identifying gaps and areas where further work is  needed, and its activities will continue in 2016.  ENISA will continue working on the implementation and update of the guidelines for security-breach notification to su- pervisory bodies by trust service providers (facilitating the application of the obligation stemming from Article 19 of the  regulation).  ENISA will continue supporting the EC in the assessment of the candidate standards that might be listed in implementing  acts that may be adopted by the EC. The scope will be enlarged to include electronic identification (eIDs), the issues of  conformity assessment and certification frameworks.  The study on security recommendations for relying parties of trust services, will produce guidelines for online services pro- viders acting as relying parties for trust services provided by third parties, on how to ensure the correct implementation of  the trust chain. The report will focus on the area of website authentication; the trust service with the highest impact on  online transactions. Website authentication is a key element to create trust between online service providers and citizens.  Online service providers, which can range from small SMEs to large public administrations, rely on website authentication  certificates and protocols to prove their identity to their consumers. However, website authentication protocols and their  building blocks are one of the main targets for emerging attacks and new vulnerabilities appear frequently.  Finally, the 2016 edition of the report on appropriate technological protection measures to preserve privacy and trust will  also support the implementation of the eIDAS regulatory framework, by addressing technological aspects and building  blocks for trust services.  Outcomes and deadlines  Based on the tasks described above, the following outcomes and deliverables are envisaged.  D15: Update on standards for trust services and electronic identification (Q4, 2016). D16: Report on security recommendations for relying parties of trust services (Q4, 2016).  Stakeholder impact  The direct beneficiaries of the results of this WPK will be:  • trust service providers • online service providers • regulatory authorities • supervisory bodies • conformity assessment bodies.  4 Core operational  ac tivit ies  42  Stakeholders will benefit by receiving guidance on how to implement the new regulatory framework, as well as recom- mendations on security measures to ensure integrity and reliability of the trust services they provide or consume.  Legal base and policy context  • ENISA regulation, Article 3, particularly 3.1(a)(ii), 3.1(b)(i) and 3.1(c)(ii). • Regulation (EU) No 910/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 July 2014 on electronic identifica-  tion and trust services for electronic transactions in the internal market. • Commission communication — ‘A coherent framework for building trust in the digital single market for e-commerce  and online services’, COM(2011) 942 final of 11 January 2012.  4.4 SO4. To enhance cooperation both between the Member States  of the European Union and between related network and  information security communities  SO4 covers aspects of cooperation between the EU MS and the EU and between related NIS communities where ENISA  could play a hole to enhance NIS cooperation.  List of work packages and short description  • WPK4.1. Cyber crisis cooperation and exercises  In the context of this work package (WKP), ENISA will further enhance its methodology, seminars, training and technical  capabilities on the organisation and management of large-scale cyber crisis exercises. The Agency will continue enhancing  its internal capabilities for managing complex, distributed exercises, by building on its previous efforts. ENISA will explore  new opportunities which will enhance the overall realism of cyber exercises.  In 2016, ENISA will organise the fourth pan-European cyber exercise, Cyber Europe 2016 (CE2016). This exercise will build  on the experience gained in previous exercises and will take into account previously identified recommendations and  findings.  Furthermore ENISA will continue supporting Member States towards the development of a sound and implementable  European cyber crisis cooperation framework and procedures.  • WPK4.2. NIS community building  The key goal of this WPK is to build upon the good experience ENISA has in supporting different operational communities  (CSIRT, law enforcement communities, European financial institutes — information sharing and analysis centre (FI-ISAC),  A-ISAC, etc.) to enhance mutually satisfactory ways to collaborate.  ENISA will develop and provide guidance based on best practice in the area of operational community efforts (operational  cooperation, information exchange, etc.). Where possible, synergies with other ENISA collaboration- and community-sup- porting efforts such as the NIS platform will be extended and, where needed, developed.  The Agency will continue its work and support of the Transits training in the area of CSIRTs in order to build communities  through a ‘learning by doing’ approach.  ENISA will also continue to support the collaboration between CSIRT and law enforcement communities, based on the  recent policy and technical developments in this area in Member States.  Work programme 2016  43  4.4.1 WPK4.1. Cyber crisis cooperation and exercises  Desired impact  • At least 10 Member States and EU institutions take part in the study on cyber crisis cooperation and exercise activities  and findings.  • At least 24 EU Member States and European Free Trade Association (Stockholm Convention) (EFTA) countries confirm  their support for Cyber Europe 2016 (CE2016).  • At least 20 EU Member States will attend the ENISA event which aims to promote cyber crisis cooperation activities  within the context of the existing NIS policy framework.  Description of tasks  Objectives  • Continue the work in the area of pan-European cyber exercises (Cyber Europe 2016) by adapting to the needs of  ENISA stakeholders.  • Enhance the capacity to support and organise cyber exercises in Europe by organising small-scale regional exercises  (EuroSOPEx).  • Identify good practices and improve operational procedures for cyber crisis cooperation in Europe within the context  of the NIS policy framework.  • Promote best practices in the area of cyber crisis cooperation and exercises at EU and international level by engaging  the NIS community.  • Draft in close cooperation with the Member States a pan-European roadmap for cyber exercises.  Pan-European cyber exercises: Cyber Europe 2016  In 2016, ENISA will organise the fourth pan-European cyber exercise; CE2016. This exercise will closely follow up and build  on the lessons learned and actions from previous exercises, such as Cyber Europe 2014 (CE2014).  CE2016 will be an exercise programme focusing on testing and training on large-scale incident management cooperation  procedures at EU and national-levels. The efforts will not focus only on organising a one-off event but rather to be a con- tinuous effort throughout the year, offering preparatory training and cooperation opportunities such as small exercises  to Member States and the EU institutions (EuroSOPEx). The exercise escalation and build-up will be realistic and focused  in order to better capture how incidents are managed and cooperation happens in real-life. The high-level exercise pro- gramme brief will have to be prepared based the lessons learned from CE2014, approved by the Member States and the  ENISA MB, and drive the whole planning process.  Following that, the detailed set-up and exercise plan will be agreed with the EU, EFTA members and EU institutions, in line  with the existing NIS policy context. Each country will be represented in the exercise planners group. This group will be  responsible for the approval of the detailed exercise set-up and plan. The approach that will be followed will be that of an  opt-in scheme for the identification of stakeholders in the countries which are interested to play in the exercise (e.g. policy  level), allowing for the countries who wish and have the appropriate resources to extend their national play.  As previously established, ENISA will not invite international organisations or participants from countries other than EU  and EFTA members to participate in EU cybersecurity exercises without having first obtained the approval of the ENISA  MB.  Enhancing the capacity to support and organise cyber exercises  ENISA will further enhance its methodology, seminars, training and technical capabilities on the organisation and man- agement of cyber crisis exercises. The Agency will continue enhancing its internal capabilities for managing complex, dis- tributed exercises by building on its previous efforts. ENISA will explore new opportunities which will enhance the overall  realism of cyber exercises.  4 Core operational  ac tivit ies  44  Furthermore, ENISA will support smaller-scale exercises, bilateral or regional, within the EU upon request. The requests  can be sent based on Article 14 of the ENISA regulation. Support could be offered with seminars and exercise planning  training, as well as actual exercise planning support including the utilisation of the cyber exercise platform (CEP), given  the resource availability of the Agency.  ENISA, in close cooperation with the EU Member States and institutions, will draft a proposal for a pan-European roadm- ap for cyber exercises. This proposal will be built on the foundation of previous consultations done with the EU Member  States and institutions.  Cyber crisis cooperation and exercises activities overview  ENISA will continue supporting Member States towards the development of sound and implementable European cyber  crisis cooperation framework and procedures. The Agency will continue exploring requirements for developing infrastruc- tures for cooperation, e.g. secure communications channels or directories.  In this context, ENISA will host a workshop on EU-SOPs as a follow-up the exercise activities. Also ENISA will issue an up- date of its report on activities in the area of cyber crisis cooperation. In addition, this report will help ENISA to reach out  to other communities/sectors.  ENISA will also ensure that adequate feedback and follow-up to previous findings and recommendations are reported  back to the stakeholders.  Outcomes and deadlines  Based on the tasks described above, the following outcomes and deliverables are envisaged:  D1: Cyber Europe 2016: exercise plan and exercises (exercise Q4, 2016). D2: EuroSOPEx 2016: exercise plan and exercises (exercises Q4, 2016). D3: Pan‑European cyber exercises roadmap (report Q4, 2016). D4: Cyber crisis cooperation procedures: follow up the NIS policy framework (report Q4, 2016).  Stakeholder impact  The primary beneficiaries of this WPK will be policymakers and organisations from public and private sectors, who will  receive integrated and consolidated information about the European NIS threat landscape and how it is evolving.

ENISA will also continue to support the collaboration between CSIRT and law enforcement communities, based on the  recent policy and technical developments in this area in Member States. This work will include close collaboration with  other institutions which are active in this field, namely the EC3. Activities agreed upon in the collaboration agreement be- tween ENISA and EC3 will be further developed, for example in the area of encouraging a more practical and regular flow  of information between CSIRTs and law enforcement communities, the exchange of specific knowledge and expertise,  elaboration of general situational reports, reports resulting from strategic analyses and best practice and strengthening  capacity building through training and awareness raising in order to safeguard NIS at EU level. For better coordination and  in order to avoid overlaps ENISA will stay engaged in the EC3 programme board. The very well established, commonly  organised ENISA-EC3 workshop will be continued.  Following its successful mechanism for building the European national and governmental CSIRT community trust and  collaboration, ENISA will organise its traditional workshop to support the national and governmental CSIRT community  grow. (11th CSIRTs in Europe workshop).  Outcomes and deadlines  Based on the tasks described above, the following outcomes and deliverables are envisaged.  D1: Continuation of existing community efforts (European FI‑ISAC, FIRST, TF‑CSIRT‑TI, etc.). D2: Annual ENISA national and governmental CSIRT workshop (Q4, 2016). D3: Annual ENISA/EC3 cybercrime workshop (Q4, 2016). D4: Supporting European network of MS CSIRTs. D5: Review on new operational communities’ development (A‑ISAC, etc.) (Q4, 2016).  Stakeholder impact  • More effective information flows between the existing community efforts (FIRST, etc.). • Timely information provided to key stakeholders on NIS incidents and on significant developments in the field. • Enhanced collaboration and trust building for different communities (European national and governmental CSIRT  community, CSIRT and law enforcement communities, etc.). • Regular updates on current and future policy efforts and developments in the incident response area.  Legal base and policy context  • ENISA regulation, Article 3, particularly 3.1(b) and 3.1(c). • Proposed NIS directive.  Work programme 2016  47  4.5 Horizontal activities supporting core operations  4.5.1 Management board, executive board and permanent stakeholders group  secretariat  During 2016, ENISA will continue to support its formal bodies, the management board (MB) and the PSG as well as the  executive board (EB) in their functions by providing secretariat functions.  For the MB, one ordinary meeting will be organised during 2016 and informal meetings will be held as necessary. The ex- isting electronic newsletter will be continued throughout 2016, as will support for the MB portal. For the PSG two formal  meetings will also be organised in the course of the year.  For the EB formal meetings will be organised during 2016; once per quarter (Q).  ENISA will continue to explore additional ways of supporting the ENISA statutory bodies in the most effective way, includ- ing the possible use of new technologies and modifications to existing processes as required.  The MB, executive board and PSG secretariat reports directly to the ED.  4.5.2 National liaison officer network Since 2014, ENISA has initiated a number of activities with the aim to strengthen cooperation within the national liaison  officers’ (NLO) network. NLOs are key actors for the Agency’s daily work and interaction, assuring, in terms of outreach,  effective liaison with the MS and dissemination of ENISA deliverables.  In 2016, ENISA will build upon these efforts and improve its cooperation with the NLO network, the first point of contact  for ENISA in the MS. In particular, the Agency will continue working on the following actions.  • An NLO meeting will be organised where possible improvements of the collaboration will be discussed. Improve- ments aim at leveraging the NLO network for the dissemination of ENISA deliverables.  • Information will be sent to the members of the NLO network at regular intervals on upcoming ENISA project-related  tenders, vacancy notices, and events organised by ENISA or which the Agency contributes to (for example co-organ- iser, etc.).  • The agency will maintain and share with the NLO network information on all relevant ENISA project activities (e.g.  unit responsible for the project, relevant tender results).  4.5.3 European Union relations As in previous years, the Agency will carry out the bulk of its EU relations work with the statutory stakeholders; the Com- mission, the EU Parliament, the Council (working groups) and MS, by using senior management for developing relations.  This approach will take due account of the management structure of the Agency so that the level of participation in any  particular meeting is appropriate. A similar approach is taken for speaking engagements.  In general, contacts at the highest level will be managed by the ED with the heads of department as backups depending  on the subject to be discussed.  4.5.4 Spokesperson, stakeholders communication and dissemination activities In 2016, ENISA will seek to improve its focus on its key activities and to provide regular information to the press and media  regarding these activities. In order to achieve this, the Agency spokesperson will be located in the Athens office and will  be in constant contact with the operational teams.  4 Core operational  ac tivit ies  48  The Agency will continue developing various tools and channels such as info graphics, the ENISA website, social media,  social networking and videos, etc.  Dissemination activities are the responsibility of the project managers, who will also work closely with the NLO contact  point and the spokesman.  4.5.5 Quality control and project office The quality control (QC) of the Agency aims to respond to a mix of regulatory and stakeholder requirements in an effort to  improve organisational performance and compliance. Scheduled annual activities associated with the promulgation and  maintenance of standard operating procedures (SOP) and a methodology, support the operational processes of the Agen- cy. The primary goal of the QC is to improve performance across the core operations, while reducing operational costs and  enhancing stakeholder satisfaction. The methodology is based on the plan-do-check-act (PDCA) cycle.  The project office in the Core operations department (COD) seeks to better coordinate the increasing number of activities  that cut across multiple operational areas within the department. Such activities include the preparation of briefings on  global issues and coordinating the coherence of recommendations across the department, the preparation of formal  documents, follow up on performance management, project management, etc.  Information security management systems (ISMS). In 2016 ENISA plans to further develop the management of informa- tion security risks and controls under the authority of the Agency’s management. The ISMS includes people, processes,  IT systems and policies. While elements of an ISMS (e.g. risk assessment, assets inventory) are well developed, targeted  efforts aim to improve both (a) the management of recurrent intrusion detection and vulnerabilities analysis exercises  and (b) the documented policy framework which is currently at the disposal of the Agency for the purpose of enhancing  the compliance position of the Agency. While these efforts are likely to lower the risk profile of the Agency, they will also  provide the added benefit of hands-on experience and allow the Agency to better guide other similar organisations and  agencies among its stakeholders, as need be.  4.5.6 Article 14 requests Article 14 requests are a mechanism that allows the MS or EU institutions to make direct requests to ENISA for carrying  out particular activities. This mechanism has become increasingly accepted in the last few years and it has grown in sig- nificance to the extent that the Agency believes that it needs to be explicitly planned for in the annual WP. Under SO2,  both WPKs WPK2.1 Assist MS capacity building and WPK2.2 Support EU institutions include deliverables dedicated to  assistance/on-request support for EU MS and institutions.  Although, by definition, it is not possible to predict the exact number or the orientation of the requests that the Agency  will receive in 2016, based on past experience the allocated resources are indicated in the summary of activities and  budget allocation section at the end of this document.  4.5.7 Data protection officer The main tasks of the data protection officer (DPO) include the following. • Inform and advise ENISA of its obligations pursuant to Regulation 45/2001/EC and to document this activity and the  responses received. • Monitor the implementation and application of ENISA’s policies in relation to the protection of personal data. • Monitor the implementation and application of Regulation 45/2001/EC at ENISA, including the requirements for data  security, information of data subjects and their requests in exercising their rights under the regulation, as well as the  requirements for prior check or prior consultation with the EDPS.  • Monitor the documentation, notification and communication of personal data in the context of ENISA’s operations. • Act as ENISA’s contact point for the EDPS on issues related to the processing of personal data; to cooperate and con-  sult with the EDPS whenever needed.  49  Work programme 2016  5  Management, administration  and support activities  5.1 Executive director’s office The executive director (ED)’s office consists of the ED and personal assistant. The ED is responsible for the overall man- agement of the Agency.  The two heads of department (Administration and support department and Core operations department), the corporate  communications officer and the Management Board and Permanent Stakeholders Group Secretariat report directly to the ED.  5.2 Administration and support department The Administration and support department (ASD) consists of Finance, accounting and procurement unit (FAP), the HR  section, the IT unit (ITU), and the team supporting the department.  The ASD is responsible for ensuring that the management of the Agency is in line with the regulatory framework estab- lished by the competent EU institutions, the MB, and the ED. The regulatory framework is composed of the financial regu- lation and the staff regulations and their respective implementing rules, as well as administrative procedures, the internal  control framework and other control mechanisms put in place to ensure compliance with the rules.  The ASD monitors the Agency control and risk framework. Constant upgrading of the internal systems and revision of the  operating standards set the ground for continuous optimisation of the internal processes and procedures. Benchmarking  with other organisations, as well as the recommendations of the European Court of Auditors (CoA) and the Internal audit  service (IAS) are used as internal performance indicators and relevant possibilities of improvement are considered.  5 Management,  administration and suppor t ac tivit ies  50  The head of the ASD (HoASD) develops the agency strategy for the administration and support activities (ASA) in line with  the WP and with the required compliance with the abovementioned bodies and rules. The HoASD is also the main contact  point as regards administrative matters, with external stakeholders such as European Commission services and DGs, the  European Parliament, the Council, the ENISA EB, ENISA MB, Hellenic authorities, etc. The head of department is supported  by the legal officer and two assistants who also support the units in the department.  5.3 Activities  5.3.1 ASA 0 Executive director’s office and general management The activities of the executive director’s (ED’s) office and general management consist of defining and implementing the  Agency’s strategy, planning, decision-making and overall management activities.  5.3.2 ASA 1 Quality management systems, ICC, security, facilities management,  internal communications  The main activities of ASA 1 supervised by the HoASD include quality management systems, internal control function  (head of administration provides the ICC), facilities management (FM) and internal communications (ICom).  ASA1 also covers: physical security and safety; support to the ICC (including risks assessment, ex post controls, etc.); Hel- lenic authorities (value-added tax (VAT) management; individual privileges management, etc.) and protocol; FM (including  building maintenance and management); internal communication and staff welfare; management reporting; support IAS/ CoA (including external audit), etc.; ENISA general report; multiannual staff policy plan. Quality management (QM) sys- tems include policies, procedures, internal workflows, compliance, organisation structure, resources to meet internal and  external stakeholder’s requirements and expectations.  In 2016 ENISA will continue to re-engineer selected  operational processes, to align organisational require- ments with actual implementation and pursue process  improvements across the board. Measuring the perfor- mance of recently designed processes, e.g. the ENISA  project management guide, for the purpose of proposing  suitable adjustments will be a priority. A risk assessment  methodology will be implemented for agency-wide risks,  as necessary. A set of tools such as electronic signatures,  electronic workflows and enterprise resource manage- ment tools are likely to be further integrated to facilitate  collaboration. Regular presentations and updates are  made available to provide guidance and promote the  performance of the quality management system.  Physical security and FM is carried out in a coherent  manner across both ENISA sites and both functions re- port into the head of administration. These activities will  ensure that staff benefit from an ergonomic and secure  environment in both agency locations. Furthermore, the  agency will ensure that the approach to logical and phys- ical security is aligned in order to ensure appropriate  protection of data.  Work programme 2016  51  FM services cater for a quality working environment and infrastructure across its two fully functional offices, ensuring  proper working conditions for the staff of the Agency. Activities include the following.  • Logistics, transport and delivery services. • Buildings and inventory management. • Purchase of stationery and consumables.  In 2016, the ICC and internal audit capability (IAC) function will monitor the Agency’s activity in administrative trans- actions, assess the risk framework and the controls in place, contribute to mapping and monitoring the key risk areas,  follow-up of the implementation of the auditors’ recommendations (CoA and the IAS) and issue exception management  reports.  ENISA will outsource the IAC to the Commission IAS and support all preventive or corrective activities resulting from the  audits performed by IAS.  The ICC and IAC will also ensure that procedures defined are effectively implemented and will carry out spot checks  (ex post controls) as required under the Agency’s financial regulation.  5.3.3 ASA 2 Finance, accounting and procurement The activities of the FAP unit consist of managing the budget of the Agency, conducting all procurement procedures and  accounting.  The mission of the accounting officer, who is functionally independent, is to execute payments and recover funds in ac- cordance with the instructions of the responsible authorising officer, to manage the treasury of the Agency, validate the  accounting systems and prepare quality annual accounts, in compliance with the applicable financial and accounting rules.  The activities of the unit are listed below.  • Financial transactions’ initiation. • Central financial verification of all financial transactions. • Budget preparation and management. • Mission management and helpdesk. • Financial helpdesk and reporting. • Accounting activities. • Statutory reporting activities, including discharge procedure. • Procurement procedures’ overall management, including procurement planning. • Overall contracts’ management. • Coordination of audits and support to all other audit assignments. • Internal training related to FAP activities. • Single point of contact for financial management matters to DG Budget (e.g. ABAC implementation). • Drafting internal financial policies. • Introducing solutions to optimise internal financial workflows.  52  52  5.3.4 ASA 3 Human resources  The activities of human resources (HR) consist in managing the rights and obligations of ENISA staff, recruitment and training.  • Management of individual staff rights and obligations, according to the stipulations of the staff regulations (SR). • Recruitment procedures. • Entitlements and leave management. • Drafting internal HR policies and implementing rules of the SR. • Medical services and health in work environment. • Training plan and career development. • Management of interim services. • Work environment and welfare.  5.3.5 ASA 4 Information and communications technology  The IT unit (named ITU) delivers internal IT systems and services to the Agency, across its two fully functional offices, as  well as to a highly mobile user-base. The IT team uses the IT Infrastructure Library (ITIL) framework as a source of good  practice in service management. Both human and financial resources are organised according to ITIL, as shown in the  summary table in the following section.  The IT team also provides infrastructure services for operational systems, e.g. Cyber Exercise Platform.  The activities of IT include help desk, operations and monitoring, services management and infrastructure management,  solutions and development. Activities have been aligned with ITIL, including budget lines, as follows: • service strategy • service transition • service security • service operations • external services • service support.  5 Management,  administration and suppor t ac tivit ies  53  Work programme 2016  6.1 Summary of core operational activities with strategic objectives,  work packages and deliverables  SO1.

Core activities are those aiming to create the impact in the core field of NIS, required by the regulation of ENI- SA and interpreted in the current policy and legal context. ASA, on the other hand, aim to provide strategic and overall  management orientation, support the core activities with infrastructure and competence, and ensure compliance with  the regulatory framework.  The purpose of activity-based budgeting (ABB) is to ensure that resource allocation is consistent with the activities of the  Agency, as described in the annual WP.  In this regard, resources engaged in ASA are re-allocated to core and horizontal operational activities in such a way that  the effort and the respective HR costs engaged in the support of the operational activities (e.g. procurement procedures  to award a contract related to a WPK/deliverables) are attributed to the latter.  While the Commission job screening methodology used for benchmarking resources employed across EU agencies is  looking at the HR allocated to functions and gives weight to job profiles and descriptions (operational, neutral, administra- tion), the ABB concept allocates the administrative and support resources according to their contribution to the Agency’s  work. Therefore the figures in following tables refer to the administration and support resources necessary to ensure the  smooth operation of the Agency, with focus on the strategic as well as day-to-day management of the Agency and com- pliance with the legal and regulatory framework (e.g. risk management, internal controls, engagement with the CoA and  IAS, statutory reporting).  NB: Full time equivalents (FTE) and costs of activities are reported on ABB basis. Costs of activities, ABB values cover also  costs including salaries.  6.2.1 Summary of core operational activities  Core operational activities (Strategic objectives 1 to 4) Operational  activities — FTEs  Total cost of  activities — ABB  SO1.

Conclusions 28  Conformity Assessment of Trust Service Providers  December 2017  05  Executive Summary  Regulation (EU) No 910/20141 (hereafter the eIDAS Regulation), on electronic identification and trust  services for electronic transactions in the internal market, provides a regulatory environment for electronic  identification of natural and legal persons and for a set of electronic trust services, among them electronic  signatures (Section 4), electronic seals (Section 5), electronic time stamps (Section 6), electronic registered  delivery services (Section 7) and certificates for website authentication (Section 8)2  It is possible to use those trust services as well as electronic documents as evidence in legal proceedings in  all EU Member States contributing to their general cross-border use. Courts (or other bodies in charge of  legal proceedings) cannot discard them as evidence only because they are electronic but have to assess  these electronic tools in the same way they would do for their paper equivalent.  To further enhance in particular the trust of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and consumers in  the internal market and to promote the use of trust services and products, the eIDAS Regulation  introduces the notions of qualified trust service and qualified trust service provider with a view to  indicating requirements and obligations that ensure high-level security and a higher presumption of their  legal effect.  Following the publication of the eIDAS Regulation, a set of secondary and co-regulatory acts had to be  published in order to provide technical guidance on how to implement the specific requirements of the  eIDAS Regulation (in the TSP part of eIDAS, the European Commission decided to publish only the  mandatory ones). ENISA aimed to develop a concise set of technical guidelines implementing the eIDAS  Regulation in the non-mandatory articles, for voluntary use of all stakeholders, including Trust Service  Providers, Supervisory Bodies and Conformity Assessment Bodies.  Every Trust Service Provider intending to start providing qualified trust services, will have to demonstrate  compliance with the requirements defined by the eIDAS Regulation to the responsible Supervisory Body,  through an audit or conformity assessment performed by an accredited Conformity Assessment Body.  Through this document, ENISA is supporting both Trust Service Providers and Conformity Assessment  Bodies in the audit activities by presenting the auditing framework. It aims at helping Trust Service  Providers fulfil the requirements defined by the eIDAS Regulation (Articles 20 and 21) as requested by  Supervisory Bodies in order to grant the qualified status to a Trust Service Provider and its provided trust  service(s).  The audit methodology as well as the recommendations regarding the Trust Service Providers  documentation and implementation presented in this document can be used as a reference by both  qualified Trust Service Providers and Conformity Assessment Bodies to support them in preparing and  performing the conformity assessment as required by the eIDAS Regulation.  1 http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/ES/TXT/?uri=uriserv:OJ.L_.2014.257.01.0073.01.ENG  2 http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32014R0910&from=EN  http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/ES/TXT/?uri=uriserv:OJ.L_.2014.257.01.0073.01.ENG  Conformity Assessment of Trust Service Providers  December 2017  06  1. Introduction  Purpose of the Document  The Regulation (EU) No 910/2014 (hereafter the eIDAS Regulation) repeals the Directive 1999/93/EC for  electronic signatures by providing a new legal framework for \"electronic identification and trust services for  electronic transactions in the internal market\". Whereas the former Directive focused on electronic  signatures only, the eIDAS Regulation extends the concept of trust services to other services such as  electronic seals and time stamps, registered mail and web site authentication. Under this Regulation, every  Trust Service Provider intending to start providing qualified trust services, will have to demonstrate  compliance with the requirements defined by the eIDAS Regulation to the responsible Supervisory Body,  through an audit or conformity assessment performed by an accredited Conformity Assessment Body.  In response to the introduction of this Regulation, ENISA has decided to support both Trust Service  Providers and Conformity Assessment Bodies in these audit activities by presenting the new auditing  framework. This auditing framework aims at supporting Trust Service Providers willing to be granted a  qualified status for the trust services they provide or in order to maintain their status by complying with all  relevant requirements form the eIDAS Regulation (Articles 20 and 21), as requested by Supervisory Bodies.  In this regard, the document will describe the audit methodology followed by Conformity Assessment  Bodies and will present recommendations regarding the Trust Service Providers documentation and  organization which can be used as a reference to prepare and perform a conformity assessment with the  respect to the eIDAS Regulation.  This auditing framework is part of the ENISA’s work to develop a concise set of technical guidelines  implementing the eIDAS Regulation in the non-mandatory articles, for voluntary use of all stakeholders,  including Trust Service Providers, Supervisory Bodies and Conformity Assessment Bodies.3  The verbs “shall”, “should” and “may” in this document should be used in accondance with ETSI guide4.  Why Audit  As stated by Article 21 of the eIDAS Regulation, all Supervisory Bodies will request Trust Service Providers  to demonstrate compliance with the requirements defined by the Regulation, through a conformity  assessment, before notifying supervisory body of the intention to provide qualified trust services.  As stated by Article 20 of the eIDAS Regulation, once the qualified status is granted, Trust Service Providers  will have to provide a new conformity assessment report to the responsible Supervisory Body, every 24  months or whenever requested by the Supervisory Body, in order to keep their qualified status.  General Concept  The diagram below provides an overview of dependencies between various stakeholders in the Trust  Service Providers Assessment Scheme under the eIDAS Regulation. As seen in Figure 1, TSP sends the  assessment report to the SB. The TSP then submits the assessment report to the SB within three working  days after having received it (cf. Article 20 (1) of the eIDAS Regulation).  3 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/trust-services/guidelines  4 https://portal.etsi.org/Portals/0/TBpages/edithelp/Docs/AGuideToWritingWorldClassStandards.pdf  https://portal.etsi.org/Portals/0/TBpages/edithelp/Docs/AGuideToWritingWorldClassStandards.pdf  Conformity Assessment of Trust Service Providers  December 2017  07  Based on Supervisory Body decision TSP status set in Trusted List by National Authority.  Figure 1: Trust Service Providers Assessment Scheme  Liability of Trust Service Providers  The eIDAS Regulation states that all Trust Service Providers should be liable for damage caused to any  natural or legal person due to failure to comply with the obligations under that Regulation, and specifically  with the Article 19.  Every national legislation on electronic signatures and on personal data protection should provide a  procedure serving to demonstrate that the Trust Service Provider is applying the current national  regulations, which are not affected by the transitional ones, such as the eIDAS Regulation. The intention or  negligence of a qualified Trust Service Providers should be presumed unless it proves that the damage  occurred without the presumed intention or negligence on its part.  The eIDAS Regulation states:  “(37) This Regulation should provide for the liability of all trust service providers. In particular, it establishes  the liability regime under which all trust service providers should be liable for damage caused to any  natural or legal person due to failure to comply with the obligations under this Regulation. In order to  facilitate the assessment of financial risk that trust service providers might have to bear or that they should  cover by insurance policies, this Regulation allows trust service providers to set limitations, under certain  conditions, on the use of the services they provide and not to be liable for damages arising from the use of  services exceeding such limitations. Customers should be duly informed about the limitations in advance.  Those limitations should be recognisable by a third party, for example by including information about the  limitations in the terms and conditions of the service provided or through other recognisable means. For the  purposes of giving effect to those principles, this Regulation should be applied in accordance with national  rules on liability. Therefore, this Regulation does not affect those national rules on, for example, definition  of damages, intention, negligence, or relevant applicable procedural rules.“  Conformity Assessment of Trust Service Providers  December 2017  08  2.

In the second case, this  conformity assessment must be performed at least every 2 years but can also be requested at any time by  the Supervisory Body (Article 17).  This section presents the general approach for Conformity Assessment Bodies to assess the conformity of  Trust Service Providers and the trust service(s) they provide as recommended by the standard ETSI EN 319  403 Trust Service Provider Conformity Assessment - Requirements for conformity assessment bodies  assessing Trust Service Providers13. This standard presents, for each step of the audit, all the general  requirements for evaluating Trust Service Providers against the requirements set out in the eIDAS  Regulation. It includes the specificities of the type of trust service to be assessed, various aspects of the  Trust Service Providers activities to be covered and relevant standards (e.g. ETSI) as well as other potential  regulatory requirements to be taken into account.  The audit process will be split into 3 parts:   Stage 0: General preparation - to agree on the terms of the audit (time, location, scope, etc.).   Stage 1: Documentation review - to review the documentation regarding the Trust Service  Providers and trust services provided.   Stage 2: On-site audit - to validate the preliminary findings and complete the audit against the  defined assessment criteria.  At the end of the process, a conformity assessment report containing all the results of the audit will be  issued by the Conformity Assessment Body to the Trust Service Providers. The final decision regarding the  qualification of the Trust Service Providers and its trust services will be taken by the responsible  Supervisory Body based on this report and any additional information requested from TSP which was  necessary to verify compliance with the requirements laid down in eIDAS regulation  2.3.1 Stage 0: General Preparation  Before starting the audit, the Conformity Assessment Body will perform a set of preparation activities in  order to define and agree with the Trust Service Provider on the plan and scope of the audit. This initial  stage will allow to set the timing of the audit as well as the exact locations where the stages will take place.  Next to that, the Conformity Assessment Body will establish the initial list of up-to-date documents,  regarding the Trust Service Provider and the trust services it provides, which are required to perform the  conformity assessment.  13 http://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_en/319400_319499/319403/02.02.02_60/en_319403v020202p.pdf  Conformity Assessment of Trust Service Providers  December 2017  13  The set of documentation typically includes:   Trust Service Provider related details (trust services, locations, sizes, functions);   policies and practices (CP/CPS);   provision and operation of trust services;   technical documentation (IT network infrastructure regarding trust services);   terms and conditions;   contractual documents with third parties;   evidences for secure and conformant operations like logs and protocols.   termination Plan  2.3.2 Stage 1: Documentation Review  During the first stage of the audit, the Conformity Assessment Body will develop its understanding of the  structure and extent of trust services provided by the Trust Service Provider, before defining an  appropriate planning for the stage 2 of the audit.  If required by the audit activities, the Conformity Assessment Body can, at any time, request additional  information to the Trust Service Provider (e.g. records, design of trust services, etc.).  Besides the review of documentation, the Conformity Assessment Body activities will also include the  verification of other elements such as:   records regarding legal entity;   contractual arrangements;   arrangements of liabilities;   other audit reports and certifications.  Incident management, for example, takes an important place in the eIDAS Regulation and all activities  regarding the reporting of security breach or loss of integrity should be taken into account seriously by all  Trust Service Providers. In this regard, ENISA is working with a group of experts for the purpose of  developing technical guidelines regarding the reporting of incidents by Supervisory Bodies.14  At the end of stage 1 the Trust Service Provider will be provided with a first finding report by the  Conformity Assessment Body. This report contains the results of the first stage of the audit and highlights  the areas of concerns along with recommendations. Although minor issues can remain open and treated  during the next stage of the audit, most of the identified issues need to be resolved before starting the  stage 2.  Next to this report, the Conformity Assessment Body will also share the planning of stage 2 with the Trust  Service Provider and request additional information or records if required for the second stage.  2.3.3 Stage 2: On-site Audit  Once all activities of stage 1 are completed and main areas of concerns resolved by the Trust Service  Provider, stage 2 of the audit can be started. This stage takes place on site, at the Trust Service Provider,  and has the purpose of demonstrating whether the Trust Service Provider and the trust services it provides  comply with its own policies and procedures as well as the defined assessment criteria (based on the eIDAS  14 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/technical-guideline-for-incident-reporting  Conformity Assessment of Trust Service Providers  December 2017  14  requirements, relevant standards, etc.). All evidences, records and logs of every action should be kept safe  and recorded to be handed over to the Conformity Assessment Body.  For this, the Conformity Assessment Body will collect evidences regarding the Trust Service Provider and its  trust services:   implementation of trust service requirements;   trust service related processes and procedures;   trust service related products (trustworthy systems);   information security measures for trust services;   physical security of relevant Trust Service Providers sites.  In order to complete this stage 2 audit, a conformity assessment report providing all results and other  relevant details of the assessment will be issued to the Trust Service Provider.  2.3.4 Conformity Assessment Report  After successful completion of the audit (i.e. stages 1 and 2), the Conformity Assessment Body will issue a  conformity assessment report. This detailed report contains all results of the assessment performed and is  provided to the audited Trust Service Provider. The Trust Service Provider must in turn provide this report  to the responsible Supervisory Body within 3 working days. Only after a full review of the conformity  assessment report and any additional information requested from TSP which was necessary to verify  compliance with the requirements laid down in eIDAS regulation will the Supervisory Body decide whether  the Trust Service Provider and the trust services it provides comply with the requirements set out it the  RegulationMaximum 3 months after the submission of the conformity assessment report, the Trust Service  Provider will be notified with the decision from the Supervisory Body. If positive, the Trust Service Provider  and the audited trust services will be granted the “qualified” status and will be added to the national  trusted list by the responsible body, if not already within. In case a qualified Trust Service Provider and its  qualified trust services do not meet the requirements set out in the Regulation, the Supervisory Body will  not grant qualified status (in case of a new TSP/TS) or will withdraw the qualified status and inform the  body responsible for the national trusted list about its decision.  Conformity Assessment of Trust Service Providers  December 2017  15  3. Trust Service Providers’ Documentation  As part of its audit activities, the Conformity Assessment Body will request specific documentation  supporting the implementation of the Trust Service Providers organization. This documentation will be  reviewed at the first stage of the audit and will serve as a basis for the audit on-site performed during the  stage 2. In this sense, it is essential for Trust Service Providers to make sure the appropriate documents  such as plans, policies and procedures are defined and continuously updated following the Trust Service  Providers changes.  The purpose of this section is to present an overview of the typical documentation to be maintained by  Trust Services Providers following recognized frameworks and standards such as IETF, NIST or ETSI. Related  information and more specifically the policy and security requirements as well as technical specifications  for Trust Service Providers can be found in the document “Recommendations for TSPs based on Standards  ” created by ENISA.15  Plans  Plans are high-level statements that aim at providing a clear understanding of the long-term objectives  defined by the Trust Service Providers throughout the organization, and are periodically reviewed and  updated by the management. Trust Service Providers should create plans to cover the various aspects of  the organization such as the security, management of systems, business continuity, management of  incidents, etc.  3.1.1 Infrastructure Management Plan  In order to respond to the continuous system evolution, Trust Service Providers should define a plan to  manage and monitor the entire infrastructure, including the following components:   the servers (CPU, storage, memory, etc.);   the databases (table spaces, data files, file systems);   the networking devices;   the security controls (firewalls, IPSs).  3.1.2 Organization Structure  An organization exists as a system of coordinated activities accomplishing its defined goals and objectives  according to the defined strategy. The structure of a Trust Service Provider is managed in a hierarchical  manner, where well defined and repetitive tasks are set at the lower level and more flexibility to perform  higher priority tasks are set at the higher level.  For this purpose, clear roles and responsibilities must be defined and assigned to personnel, based on their  place in the hierarchy, in order to perform their tasks efficiently. It should also include recommendations  enforcing security measures as well as methods to maintain the personnel discipline.  3.1.3 Security Plan  A security plan supports Trust Service Providers in ensuring the continuous protection of their IT resources  by providing a clear overview of the security requirements and describing the management, operational as  15 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/trust-services/guidelines  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/trust-services/guidelines  Conformity Assessment of Trust Service Providers  December 2017  16  well as technical controls in place. The plan should also address the roles and responsibilities regarding the  access to the resources and the associated authorizations.  For the creation of security plan, Trust Service Providers should follow existing standards such as ISO/IEC  2700116 and make sure it is aligned with other plans such as the risk management plan, business continuity  plan or incident management plan.  3.1.4 Communication Plan  In order to ensure an efficient exchange of all the required information internally but also outside the  organization (e.g. with customers), Trust Service Providers must have a dedicated communication plan in  place.  This plan presents the type of information published and the way this is done, but also defines the target  audience as well as potential impacts on the Trust Service Providers and provided trust services.  Based on the target audience and the type of information to be communicated, Trust Service Providers  may categorize communication as follows:   internal communication (e.g. to employees);   business communication (e.g. to customers);   emergency communication;   media communication;   shareholders communication.  Internal communication will follow procedures that differ from the ones used for external communications  (e.g. announcement of a new product).  3.1.5 Risk Management Plan  As the networked world continues to shape and impact every aspect of our lives, threats to the global  industry continue in parallel.  For this purpose, Trust Service Providers must have an appropriate risk management plan in place to  support the identification and evaluation of emerging risks and the implementation of appropriate controls  to avoid them.  Technical guidelines regarding the conduction of a risk assessment on Trust Service Providers as part of the  eIDAS Regulation can be found in the document “Recommendations for TSPs based on Standards  ”  created by ENISA. 17  3.1.6 Business Continuity Plan  In order to ensure the preservation of its business (e.g. trust services) during and after a disaster, Trust  Service Providers should have a well-defined business continuity plan (including disaster recovery plan and  contingency plan) as part of its response planning.  16 http://www.iso.org/iso/iso27001  17 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/trust-services/guidelines  http://www.iso.org/iso/iso27001 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/trust-services/guidelines  Conformity Assessment of Trust Service Providers  December 2017  17  This plan aims at describing all the arrangements foreseen by the Trust Service Providers, including  processes and procedures, to recover as quickly as possible from any kind of major disruption regarding its  network or its systems and continue to provide its services.  The business continuity plan should be maintained, tested and be subject of training. As part of its  implementation, this plan will require the creation of two other plans: a disaster recovery plan and a  contingency plan.  3.1.6.1 Disaster Recovery Plan (DRP)  The disaster recovery plan defines the technical and functional requirements to protect the IT  infrastructure of Trust Service Providers and restore its operability following a disaster.  Analysis and availability of critical recovery resources is important in order to develop the ongoing  recovery cost estimates. There should be specific recovery strategies defined for IT as well as business  processes.  Some requirements to consider regarding the IT infrastructure include:   systems hardware resources;   systems data storage requirements;   unique (i.e. nonstandard) hardware resources;   distributed systems (e.g. workstations, extranet, intranet, etc.).  3.1.6.2 Contingency Plan  A contingency plan defines all the interim measures, such as the relocation of systems to a back-up site,  which are in place to help Trust Service Providers recover from a disaster and ensure the continuation of  its services. This plan can include several phases including detection, notification, evaluation and  resolution, which must be described and checked.  3.1.7 Incident Management Plan  Trust Service Providers should have a plan to manage incidents impacting their infrastructure and that can  affect the normal operation of the services provided., This plan should include specific information such as  the incident category as well as  the measures to mitigate the impact and prevent further damage to the  Trust Service Providers operations.  It is recommended that Trust Service Providers align this incident management plan with other plans such  as the business continuation plan as part of the response operations.  3.1.8 Training Plan  Given the complexity of Trust Service Providers environment, all personnel (e.g. employees,  subcontractors) should be educated and receive guidance for the most important aspects of Trust Service  Providers operations. For this purpose, the Trust Service Providers should define a clear plan describing the  type of trainings required and how they can be given according to the target audience.  Many topics that should be covered by the training plan, including:   corporate policies;   regulatory compliance;   business continuity and disaster recovery;   risk management;  Conformity Assessment of Trust Service Providers  December 2017  18   physical and logical infrastructure.  Moreover, the training plan should inform personnel about their roles and responsibilities as well as the  surrounding expectations.  3.1.9 Legal Enforcement Plan  TPSs should have a clear plan to address the major legal obligations at national and international level,  which can affect the services provided.  Besides the eIDAS Regulation, Trust Service Providers may be subject to other applicable laws such as:   national laws related to electronic signatures;   personal data protection laws;   contract laws.  3.1.10 Access Control Plan  Trust Service Providers should have a clear and agreed plan regarding control of personnel access to the IT  resources, as either logical (e.g. systems, databases) or physical (e.g. facilities), in order to prevent  undesired access.  This plan should describe the requirements (i.e. type of users, resources to access, operations to perform,  etc.) and controls in place to restrict access and therefore ensure the protection of the resources.  3.1.11 Termination Plan  Trust Service Providers providing qualified trust services should have an up-to-date termination plan18 to  ensure continuity of service in accordance with provisions verified by the supervisory body under point (i)  of Article 17(4).  Thus, aiming to ensure sustainability and durability of qualified trust services and to boost users’  confidence in the continuity of qualified trust services, supervisory bodies should verify the existence and  the correct application of provisions on termination plans in cases where qualified trust service providers  cease their activities.  Policies  Policies are principles, rules or guidelines established and adopted by Trust Service Providers to influence  or determine the way of proceeding in specific cases or areas.  It should be noted that any creation or update to existing policies should be reviewed and receive the  approval from the responsible Internal Governance Body before its publication. Trust Service Providers  should define a similar body which is responsible for the control and the maintenance of all the policies  and practices (e.g. CP/CPS) within the organization, as well as the review of audit results to check policy  compliance.  3.2.1 Security Policy  The security policy is the main policy in place regarding the objectives of an organization to protect its  assets. This policy defines the main rules set by the organization and to be followed in order to ensure the  security of all IT resources, facilities but also personnel within the organization.  18 http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32014R0910&from=EN  Conformity Assessment of Trust Service Providers  December 2017  19  Trust Service Providers should write a security policy covering specific areas such as:   Risk Management;   Disaster Recovery;   User Responsibilities;   Internet and E-mail Policies;   Password Policies.  3.2.2 Access Control Policy  The access control policy defines the rules set by an organization regarding the access to its IT resources by  all entities within or outside the organization (e.g. employees, customers).  Trust Service Providers should develop an access control policy to clearly set the requirements regarding  the identification, authentication, authorization and monitoring of who or what is accessing specific  resources in order to protect the company from threats and vulnerabilities, related to undesired access to  the Trust Service Providers assets.  3.2.3 Certificate Policy and Certification Practice Statement  The X.509 standard defines a Certificate Policy (CP) as “a named set of rules that indicates the applicability  of a certificate to a particular community and/or class of application with common security requirements”.  In general, as mentioned above, there are two major categories of CPs:   Focused on indication applicability of a certificate to a particular community (e.g. geographical  region, specific market or finance, assurance, etc.).   Focused on indication applicability of a certificate to a class of application with common security  requirements (e.g. different level of security and level of assurance).  The CP can be represented in a certificate by a unique number called an Object Identifier (OID) which can  be registered and assigned to a particular organization.  The DSG defines a Certification Practice Statement (CPS) as “a statement of the practices which a  certification authority employs in issuing certificates”19.  In other words, the CPS establishes the practices used by a CA regarding the management of the  certificates lifecycle (e.g. certificate issuance, revocation, re-key, etc.).  While the CP defines the requirements and appropriate usage for the certificate types issued by the PKI,  the CPS states the PKI actors, their roles and duties, and describes the practice employed by the CA  following best practices and requirements defined in the CP.  The RFC 3647 “Internet X.509 Public Key Infrastructure Certification Policy and Certification Practices  Framework\"20 provides some guidance and the recommended structure for the creation of a CP and/or  CPS:  19 American Bar Association, Digital Signature Guidelines: Legal Infrastructure for Certification Authorities and Secure  Electronic Commerce, 1996.  20 https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3647.txt  Conformity Assessment of Trust Service Providers  December 2017  20  1.

Facilities, Management, and Operational Controls  6. Technical Security Controls  7. Certificate, CRL, and OCSP Profile  8. Compliance Audit and Other Assessments  9. Other Business and Legal Matters  Trust Service Providers willing to issue qualified certificates can follow the ETSI EN 319 411-2 “Electronic  Signatures and Infrastructures (ESI); Policy and security requirements for Trust Service Providers issuing  certificates; Part 2: Requirements for trust service providers issuing EU qualified certificates”21. This  standard supports Trust Service Providers in the writing of their CP and/or CPS by providing the general  policy and security requirements that meet the requirements set out in the eIDAS Regulation, including  Articles 19, 24, 28, 38 and 45.  The CP and CPS constitute both a basis for most of audits, accreditations, and other assessments of a Trust  Service Providers.  3.2.4 Archive Policy  The archive policy is an internal document maintained by Trust Service Providers to define the rules  regarding the archival of critical information, due to either business or legal requirements.  This policy sets the rules regarding the archival process, specific to the type of data to be archived. It  includes information such as the archiving criteria, mechanism and storage used, retention period as well  as the people authorized to perform the archive.  Procedures  Procedures are step-by-step instructions to be followed in order to perform specifics tasks. They support  the implementation of the plans and policies defined by the Trust Service Providers in a consistent and  regular basis by providing clarity and a common understanding of the operations. Usually, procedures  come along with well-defined roles and responsibilities.  In order to reduce the risks that important steps, communication and required deliverables are left out,  procedures should be best developed with input of interfacing areas. Moreover the associated  documentation should be consistent in order to give the ability to improve and facilitate the review of the  procedures in place.  3.3.1 Operations Security  Operations security procedures aim at supporting Trust Service Providers in ensuring the security of their  operations by protecting and controlling their information assets.  Moreover, these procedures should encompass all the required tasks in order to ensure the availability of  all IT resources.  Operations security procedures can be divided into different areas such as:  21 http://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_en/319400_319499/31941102/02.01.01_60/en_31941102v020101p.pdf  Conformity Assessment of Trust Service Providers  December 2017  21   roles and responsibilities for trusted personnel operators (e.g. system/security admins, auditors);   resources protection (e.g. facilities, hardware, software);   continuity of operations (e.g. business continuity and disaster recovery);   change control management.  3.3.2 Change Control Management  Trust Service Providers systems require frequent changes, due to software packages added, removed or  modified, or because of the introduction of new hardware.  This rapid advancement of technology requires proper change management control procedures in order to  perform maintenance activities in a controlled way and ensure the integrity of the necessary systems.  Trust Service Providers should indicate the scope of the affecting system(s) (e.g. on test, production) and  of the kind of modification (e.g. permanent changes, temporary changes, emergency changes) and the  procedure associated to it. All these requirements should be defined accordingly and a responsible person  should be designated for every asset. These procedures should have a workflow including at least:   identification of the change (e.g. affected services);   technical evaluation and risks associated to the change;   approval of the change;   information of the change (e.g. according to the communication policy);   execution of the change;   new testing to validate the change.  For recovery and integrity purposes, a detailed inventory of the hardware and software is necessary.  3.3.3 Risk Assessment  Risk assessment procedures should provide all the requirements for assessing risks with regards to Trust  Service Providers operations. These procedures should support personnel in identifying, understanding  and evaluating the risks in order to take the appropriate actions to tackle them using the appropriate  measures. In order to keep track of actions taken and leave room for improvement, all identified risks as  well as relevant associated information should be recorded for further analysis.  For information on the risk analysis procedure, please consult ENISA guidelines published in 201322.  3.3.4 Network Security  Network security includes the structures, transport methods and formats, as well as all security measures  in place to ensure integrity, availability and confidentiality of all Trust Service Providers’ data transferred  over private and public networks.  Since any loss of network connectivity, internally or externally, may have disastrous consequences,  ensuring network security is one of the main keys for Trust Service Providers.  Procedures associated to network security should consist of a list of specific actions to be executed at  different levels, including:   physical and logical network protection (e.g. network segmentation, configuration of network  security devices, security patches, permissions granting);  22 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/identity-and-trust/trust-services/guidelines-tsp  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/identity-and-trust/trust-services/guidelines-tsp  Conformity Assessment of Trust Service Providers  December 2017  22   trusted roles and system accounts (e.g. roles and responsibilities, access control);   logs, monitoring and alerts (e.g. network infrastructure monitoring, alerts configuration, logging  records, vulnerabilities detection).  3.3.5 Incident Response  Incident response procedures define all the precise steps to be followed in order to address and manage  the consequences of an incident (e.g. security breach) and mitigate its impact, according to the defined  plan. The procedures should indicate all the details required to appropriately handle a specific type of  incident, including:   level of importance;   response time;   responsible people;   communication needs.  Evidence management  Evidence is collected with the purpose of providing details regarding an event and demonstrating the  effectiveness of associated procedures. Measurement of this information provides the ability to improve  the procedures.  3.4.1 Evidence Documentation  For every defined plans, policies and procedures, Trust Service Providers should obtain evidence that the  related documents are consistently followed up. For this purpose, tools can support the Trust Service  Providers in the execution of specific tasks, and provide efficient management of all analogous  information.  For example, there are tools supporting the execution of risk analysis or the management of Trust Service  Providers assets (i.e. their location, owners, characteristics, etc.).  3.4.2 Testing  All tests performed within the Trust Service Providers infrastructure should be documented along with all  associated information and the required level of detail (e.g. test type, plan testing, quality status, etc.).  3.4.3 Agreements and Contracts  All contracts and agreements such as NDAs, SLAs and confidentiality agreements, between Trust Service  Providers and their employees, customers or other third parties should be maintained and kept in a safe  place in order to protect the company in case of dispute.  3.4.4 Evaluation Reports  In order to ensure the effectiveness and proper functioning of the resources, evaluation of all hardware  and software in place at the Trust Service Providers should be performed on a regular basis, generating  evaluation reports as well as evidence that should be recorded. Evaluation reports can also be generated  following other kinds of activities such as personnel trainings (e.g. tests) or audits (e.g. findings).  3.4.5 Event Logs  Logging events can help the Trust Service Providers track issues and find the root causes in case of  incidents such as system failures or security breaches. For this purpose, all the logs generated by a system  with regards to specific events should be recorded and stored accordingly by the Trust Service Providers.  Conformity Assessment of Trust Service Providers  December 2017  23  3.4.6 Regulatory Compliance  In order to show compliance with the eIDAS Regulation as well  as, where applicable, other national or  international laws, all relevant evidence that can be used as a proof of compliance should be recorded and  stored by the Trust Service Providers.  Conformity Assessment of Trust Service Providers  December 2017  24  4. Trust Service Providers Organization  Trust Service Providers Services  This section describes the various component services related to the certification services. It focuses  mainly on certification services because they form the foundation of all trust services under the eIDAS  Regulation, such as electronic signatures, seals or time stamps. Any Trust Service Provider willing to  provide qualified trust services will first have to make sure its certification service or its third-party service  provider fulfils all the requirements set out in the eIDAS Regulation regarding the issuance of qualified  certificates for the defined purpose. The subdivision of services is only for the purposes of clarification and  does not place any restrictions on the implementation of the Trust Service Providers services.  4.1.1 Registration Service  The registration service verifies the identity and if applicable, any specific attributes of a subject. The  results of this service are passed to the certificate generation service (section 4.1.2).  This service is often provisioned by a Registration Authority (RA), which has formal agreement with the  Certification Authority (CA) to identify and authenticate the certificate subjects, verify the documentation  accrediting the circumstances appearing in the certificates and validate the requests to issue, revoke or  renew certificates.  The RA should assume the following obligations:   Validating the identity and other personal details of the subject of the certificates or information  relevant for the purpose of the certificates in accordance with the associated procedures.   Maintaining all information and documentation concerning certificates, and managing their  issuance, renewal, revocation and reactivation.   Notifying the CA of certificate revocation requests with due diligence and in a fast and reliable  manner.   Informing the CA of all issuance, renewal and reactivation requests, and any other aspects of  certificate management.   Validating with due diligence the circumstances for revocation that might affect the certificate  validity.   Performing its certificate management operations in compliance with the procedures established  by the Trust Service Providers and current legislation.   Where applicable, making available to the subject the technical procedures for signature creation  data (i.e. the private key) and electronic signature verification (i.e. the public key).  The process associated to the proper identification of the subscriber is the responsibility of the Trust  Service Providers, and should be performed prior to the issuance of the certificate.  The certificate will only be issued if this process is completed successfully, otherwise the RA will refuse the  request and inform the applicant of the reasons.  4.1.2 Certificate Generation Service  Subscriber certificates can be issued either by means of a cryptographic device or a software mechanism.  4.1.2.1 Cryptographic Device  The typical issuance procedure for certificates issued using a cryptographic device is the following:  Conformity Assessment of Trust Service Providers  December 2017  25  1. The RA verifies the validity of the documentation submitted by the applicant.  2. Following the applicant authentication, the RA requests a certificate from the CA.  3. The CA issues the certificate to the RA following the established procedures.  4. The RA securely downloads the certificate on the signature creation device.  4.1.2.2 Software Mechanism  The issuance procedure for certificates issued using a software mechanism is the following:  1. The RA verifies the validity of the documentation submitted by the applicant.  2. Together with the application form, the applicant generates a key pair giving the public key.  3. After receiving the documentation and the public key, the CA issues the certificate.  4. The private key and the certificate are stored on the cryptographic device or on the computer of the  subscriber.  4.1.3 Subject Device Provision Service  The subject device provision service is an optional service which aims at preparing, and providing or  making available secure cryptographic devices, or other secure devices, to subjects.  4.1.4 Dissemination Service  The purpose of the dissemination service is to disseminate the certificates to subjects, and in case of  subject consents, make them available to relying parties. This service also makes available the Trust Service  Providers terms and conditions as well as any published policy and practice information (e.g. CP/CPS) to  subscribers and relying parties.  Depending on the method used to issue the certificate, the associated private key will be delivered to the  entities in a different way:   If the certificate is issued on a cryptographic hardware device (section 4.1.2.1), the private key is  delivered on the cryptographic device.   If the certificate is issued on a software mechanism (section 4.1.2.2), the private key is generated  by the server and does not need to be delivered.  4.1.5 Revocation Management Service  The revocation management service processes requests and reports relating to revocation to determine  the necessary action to be taken. The results of this service are distributed through the revocation status  service.  Various reasons can lead to the revocation of certificates, which can vary according to the nature of the  certificate (i.e. subscriber or CA certificate).  Trust Service Providers must provide a process for subscribers to request the revocation of their certificate,  which should be described in the available CP/CPS. The qualified Trust Service Providers shall maintain a  continuous 24x7 ability to accept and respond to revocation requests and related inquiries.  In regards to private key compromise, certificate misuse and other types of fraud or inappropriate  conduct, the Trust Service Providers must provide third parties with clear instructions for reporting  through readily accessible online means.  For instance, some reasons to request the revocation of a certificate may the following:   loss or compromise of the private key;  Conformity Assessment of Trust Service Providers  December 2017  26   legal or administrative order;   subscriber employment termination.  4.1.6 Revocation Status Service  The certification revocation status service provides certificate status information to relying parties, either  based upon revocation lists or using an online service providing status information on an individual basis.  The two common schemes for certificate status validation are: Certificate Revocation Lists (CRL) and Online  Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP).  As required by the eIDAS Regulation (Article 24), every request for the revocation of a qualified certificate  must be handled by the Trust Service Providers and the new status published at maximum 24 hours after  the receipt. The revocation becomes effective immediately after its publication.  4.1.6.1 Certificate Revocation List (CRL)  A CRL is a time-stamped list containing all the revoked certificates which is signed by the issuing CA (or  another CRL issuer) and made available through a public repository.  There are some recommendations that a CRL for end entity certificates should be issued at least every 24  hours or when a revocation occurs, and should be valid for 10 days.  All recommended specifications regarding the management of CRLs can be found in the RFC 5280.  4.1.6.2 Online Certificate Service Protocol (OCSP)  Trust Service Providers may also provide third parties with a real-time online service based on OCSP, which  allows to immediately verify the status of a certificate. This service should be available 24 hours a day, 7  days a week. OCSP responses are signed either by the CA who issued the certificate or the OCSP  responder.  All recommended specifications regarding the protocol OCSP can be found in the RFC 6960.  Trust Service Provider Infrastructure  As part of the requirements form the eIDAS Regulation, Trust Service Providers must address physical and  logical security related to their infrastructure using all appropriate countermeasures as well as defensive  and recovery strategies. Further information regarding the infrastructure of Trust Service Providers and  trust services (including entities, assets and processes to be protected) can be found within the other  technical guideline documents developed by ENISA23.  Personnel Security  Trust Service Providers should implement procedures for personnel regarding security issues and how to  proceed accordingly. Specific procedures regarding “trusted roles”24 should be clearly defined by Trust  Service Providers, along with the associated tasks to be performed.  In order to make sure that people with trusted roles perform their corresponding duties properly, the  following considerations should be addressed by Trust Service Providers:  23 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/trust-services/guidelines  24 A trusted role is defined as a set of responsibilities assigned to a person, and that can lead to security problems if  not performed satisfactorily, either accidentally or maliciously.  Conformity Assessment of Trust Service Providers  December 2017  27   The technology is designed and configured in order to prevent errors and improper conduct.   The duties are distributed among several individuals so that any action must be approved by at  least two people.  The Trust Service Providers should make available a full inventory of all the roles carried out in the  organization, along with associated duties and responsibilities. Each of these roles should come with a  clear definition as well as a set of documented procedures.  4.3.1 Personnel controls  Trust Service Providers should implement several controls regarding the personnel requirements and  needs:   Background, qualification and experience (i.e. personnel should have the required experience and  qualification to perform their job);   Training (i.e. provide personnel with the required trainings and maintain records);   Retraining (i.e. new training plan following any significant change to CA operations);   Sanction for unauthorized actions (i.e. internal disciplinary regime defining the sanction against  personnel);   Contracting personnel (i.e. maintenance of specific policies regarding contracting personnel);   Documentation (i.e. provide all personnel with required Trust Service Providers documentation  such as CP/CPS, operations manuals, etc.).

Conclusions  This document provided an overview of the auditing framework for Trust Service Providers as part of the  eIDAS Regulation and articles 17, 20 and 21 in particular. It discussed the available standards and  methodology used to perform the conformity assessment as well as the relevant documentation and  recommended implementation for Trust Service Providers organizations.  All information presented in this document can be followed as reference by both Trust Service Providers  and Conformity Assessment Bodies for the purpose of preparing and performing the conformity  assessment, as required by the eIDAS Regulation, in the best possible conditions. It presented the  measures that can be taken at organizational level, drawing to norms and standards for technical details.  Besides the eIDAS Regulation, this framework can also serve as baseline for other kinds of Trust Service  Providers assessments or audits.  Main requirements and examples were provided in the context of qualified Trust Service Providers  providing service for to the issuance of qualified certificates, however these also apply to other Trust  Service Providers and trust services as defined in the Regulation.

Conclusions 28  Conformity Assessment of Trust Service Providers  December 2017  05  Executive Summary  Regulation (EU) No 910/20141 (hereafter the eIDAS Regulation), on electronic identification and trust  services for electronic transactions in the internal market, provides a regulatory environment for electronic  identification of natural and legal persons and for a set of electronic trust services, among them electronic  signatures (Section 4), electronic seals (Section 5), electronic time stamps (Section 6), electronic registered  delivery services (Section 7) and certificates for website authentication (Section 8)2  It is possible to use those trust services as well as electronic documents as evidence in legal proceedings in  all EU Member States contributing to their general cross-border use. Courts (or other bodies in charge of  legal proceedings) cannot discard them as evidence only because they are electronic but have to assess  these electronic tools in the same way they would do for their paper equivalent.  To further enhance in particular the trust of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and consumers in  the internal market and to promote the use of trust services and products, the eIDAS Regulation  introduces the notions of qualified trust service and qualified trust service provider with a view to  indicating requirements and obligations that ensure high-level security and a higher presumption of their  legal effect.  Following the publication of the eIDAS Regulation, a set of secondary and co-regulatory acts had to be  published in order to provide technical guidance on how to implement the specific requirements of the  eIDAS Regulation (in the TSP part of eIDAS, the European Commission decided to publish only the  mandatory ones). ENISA aimed to develop a concise set of technical guidelines implementing the eIDAS  Regulation in the non-mandatory articles, for voluntary use of all stakeholders, including Trust Service  Providers, Supervisory Bodies and Conformity Assessment Bodies.  Every Trust Service Provider intending to start providing qualified trust services, will have to demonstrate  compliance with the requirements defined by the eIDAS Regulation to the responsible Supervisory Body,  through an audit or conformity assessment performed by an accredited Conformity Assessment Body.  Through this document, ENISA is supporting both Trust Service Providers and Conformity Assessment  Bodies in the audit activities by presenting the auditing framework. It aims at helping Trust Service  Providers fulfil the requirements defined by the eIDAS Regulation (Articles 20 and 21) as requested by  Supervisory Bodies in order to grant the qualified status to a Trust Service Provider and its provided trust  service(s).  The audit methodology as well as the recommendations regarding the Trust Service Providers  documentation and implementation presented in this document can be used as a reference by both  qualified Trust Service Providers and Conformity Assessment Bodies to support them in preparing and  performing the conformity assessment as required by the eIDAS Regulation.  1 http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/ES/TXT/?uri=uriserv:OJ.L_.2014.257.01.0073.01.ENG  2 http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32014R0910&from=EN  http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/ES/TXT/?uri=uriserv:OJ.L_.2014.257.01.0073.01.ENG  Conformity Assessment of Trust Service Providers  December 2017  06  1. Introduction  Purpose of the Document  The Regulation (EU) No 910/2014 (hereafter the eIDAS Regulation) repeals the Directive 1999/93/EC for  electronic signatures by providing a new legal framework for \"electronic identification and trust services for  electronic transactions in the internal market\". Whereas the former Directive focused on electronic  signatures only, the eIDAS Regulation extends the concept of trust services to other services such as  electronic seals and time stamps, registered mail and web site authentication. Under this Regulation, every  Trust Service Provider intending to start providing qualified trust services, will have to demonstrate  compliance with the requirements defined by the eIDAS Regulation to the responsible Supervisory Body,  through an audit or conformity assessment performed by an accredited Conformity Assessment Body.  In response to the introduction of this Regulation, ENISA has decided to support both Trust Service  Providers and Conformity Assessment Bodies in these audit activities by presenting the new auditing  framework. This auditing framework aims at supporting Trust Service Providers willing to be granted a  qualified status for the trust services they provide or in order to maintain their status by complying with all  relevant requirements form the eIDAS Regulation (Articles 20 and 21), as requested by Supervisory Bodies.  In this regard, the document will describe the audit methodology followed by Conformity Assessment  Bodies and will present recommendations regarding the Trust Service Providers documentation and  organization which can be used as a reference to prepare and perform a conformity assessment with the  respect to the eIDAS Regulation.  This auditing framework is part of the ENISA’s work to develop a concise set of technical guidelines  implementing the eIDAS Regulation in the non-mandatory articles, for voluntary use of all stakeholders,  including Trust Service Providers, Supervisory Bodies and Conformity Assessment Bodies.3  The verbs “shall”, “should” and “may” in this document should be used in accondance with ETSI guide4.  Why Audit  As stated by Article 21 of the eIDAS Regulation, all Supervisory Bodies will request Trust Service Providers  to demonstrate compliance with the requirements defined by the Regulation, through a conformity  assessment, before notifying supervisory body of the intention to provide qualified trust services.  As stated by Article 20 of the eIDAS Regulation, once the qualified status is granted, Trust Service Providers  will have to provide a new conformity assessment report to the responsible Supervisory Body, every 24  months or whenever requested by the Supervisory Body, in order to keep their qualified status.  General Concept  The diagram below provides an overview of dependencies between various stakeholders in the Trust  Service Providers Assessment Scheme under the eIDAS Regulation. As seen in Figure 1, TSP sends the  assessment report to the SB. The TSP then submits the assessment report to the SB within three working  days after having received it (cf. Article 20 (1) of the eIDAS Regulation).  3 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/trust-services/guidelines  4 https://portal.etsi.org/Portals/0/TBpages/edithelp/Docs/AGuideToWritingWorldClassStandards.pdf  https://portal.etsi.org/Portals/0/TBpages/edithelp/Docs/AGuideToWritingWorldClassStandards.pdf  Conformity Assessment of Trust Service Providers  December 2017  07  Based on Supervisory Body decision TSP status set in Trusted List by National Authority.  Figure 1: Trust Service Providers Assessment Scheme  Liability of Trust Service Providers  The eIDAS Regulation states that all Trust Service Providers should be liable for damage caused to any  natural or legal person due to failure to comply with the obligations under that Regulation, and specifically  with the Article 19.  Every national legislation on electronic signatures and on personal data protection should provide a  procedure serving to demonstrate that the Trust Service Provider is applying the current national  regulations, which are not affected by the transitional ones, such as the eIDAS Regulation. The intention or  negligence of a qualified Trust Service Providers should be presumed unless it proves that the damage  occurred without the presumed intention or negligence on its part.  The eIDAS Regulation states:  “(37) This Regulation should provide for the liability of all trust service providers. In particular, it establishes  the liability regime under which all trust service providers should be liable for damage caused to any  natural or legal person due to failure to comply with the obligations under this Regulation. In order to  facilitate the assessment of financial risk that trust service providers might have to bear or that they should  cover by insurance policies, this Regulation allows trust service providers to set limitations, under certain  conditions, on the use of the services they provide and not to be liable for damages arising from the use of  services exceeding such limitations. Customers should be duly informed about the limitations in advance.  Those limitations should be recognisable by a third party, for example by including information about the  limitations in the terms and conditions of the service provided or through other recognisable means. For the  purposes of giving effect to those principles, this Regulation should be applied in accordance with national  rules on liability. Therefore, this Regulation does not affect those national rules on, for example, definition  of damages, intention, negligence, or relevant applicable procedural rules.“  Conformity Assessment of Trust Service Providers  December 2017  08  2.

In the second case, this  conformity assessment must be performed at least every 2 years but can also be requested at any time by  the Supervisory Body (Article 17).  This section presents the general approach for Conformity Assessment Bodies to assess the conformity of  Trust Service Providers and the trust service(s) they provide as recommended by the standard ETSI EN 319  403 Trust Service Provider Conformity Assessment - Requirements for conformity assessment bodies  assessing Trust Service Providers13. This standard presents, for each step of the audit, all the general  requirements for evaluating Trust Service Providers against the requirements set out in the eIDAS  Regulation. It includes the specificities of the type of trust service to be assessed, various aspects of the  Trust Service Providers activities to be covered and relevant standards (e.g. ETSI) as well as other potential  regulatory requirements to be taken into account.  The audit process will be split into 3 parts:   Stage 0: General preparation - to agree on the terms of the audit (time, location, scope, etc.).   Stage 1: Documentation review - to review the documentation regarding the Trust Service  Providers and trust services provided.   Stage 2: On-site audit - to validate the preliminary findings and complete the audit against the  defined assessment criteria.  At the end of the process, a conformity assessment report containing all the results of the audit will be  issued by the Conformity Assessment Body to the Trust Service Providers. The final decision regarding the  qualification of the Trust Service Providers and its trust services will be taken by the responsible  Supervisory Body based on this report and any additional information requested from TSP which was  necessary to verify compliance with the requirements laid down in eIDAS regulation  2.3.1 Stage 0: General Preparation  Before starting the audit, the Conformity Assessment Body will perform a set of preparation activities in  order to define and agree with the Trust Service Provider on the plan and scope of the audit. This initial  stage will allow to set the timing of the audit as well as the exact locations where the stages will take place.  Next to that, the Conformity Assessment Body will establish the initial list of up-to-date documents,  regarding the Trust Service Provider and the trust services it provides, which are required to perform the  conformity assessment.  13 http://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_en/319400_319499/319403/02.02.02_60/en_319403v020202p.pdf  Conformity Assessment of Trust Service Providers  December 2017  13  The set of documentation typically includes:   Trust Service Provider related details (trust services, locations, sizes, functions);   policies and practices (CP/CPS);   provision and operation of trust services;   technical documentation (IT network infrastructure regarding trust services);   terms and conditions;   contractual documents with third parties;   evidences for secure and conformant operations like logs and protocols.   termination Plan  2.3.2 Stage 1: Documentation Review  During the first stage of the audit, the Conformity Assessment Body will develop its understanding of the  structure and extent of trust services provided by the Trust Service Provider, before defining an  appropriate planning for the stage 2 of the audit.  If required by the audit activities, the Conformity Assessment Body can, at any time, request additional  information to the Trust Service Provider (e.g. records, design of trust services, etc.).  Besides the review of documentation, the Conformity Assessment Body activities will also include the  verification of other elements such as:   records regarding legal entity;   contractual arrangements;   arrangements of liabilities;   other audit reports and certifications.  Incident management, for example, takes an important place in the eIDAS Regulation and all activities  regarding the reporting of security breach or loss of integrity should be taken into account seriously by all  Trust Service Providers. In this regard, ENISA is working with a group of experts for the purpose of  developing technical guidelines regarding the reporting of incidents by Supervisory Bodies.14  At the end of stage 1 the Trust Service Provider will be provided with a first finding report by the  Conformity Assessment Body. This report contains the results of the first stage of the audit and highlights  the areas of concerns along with recommendations. Although minor issues can remain open and treated  during the next stage of the audit, most of the identified issues need to be resolved before starting the  stage 2.  Next to this report, the Conformity Assessment Body will also share the planning of stage 2 with the Trust  Service Provider and request additional information or records if required for the second stage.  2.3.3 Stage 2: On-site Audit  Once all activities of stage 1 are completed and main areas of concerns resolved by the Trust Service  Provider, stage 2 of the audit can be started. This stage takes place on site, at the Trust Service Provider,  and has the purpose of demonstrating whether the Trust Service Provider and the trust services it provides  comply with its own policies and procedures as well as the defined assessment criteria (based on the eIDAS  14 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/technical-guideline-for-incident-reporting  Conformity Assessment of Trust Service Providers  December 2017  14  requirements, relevant standards, etc.). All evidences, records and logs of every action should be kept safe  and recorded to be handed over to the Conformity Assessment Body.  For this, the Conformity Assessment Body will collect evidences regarding the Trust Service Provider and its  trust services:   implementation of trust service requirements;   trust service related processes and procedures;   trust service related products (trustworthy systems);   information security measures for trust services;   physical security of relevant Trust Service Providers sites.  In order to complete this stage 2 audit, a conformity assessment report providing all results and other  relevant details of the assessment will be issued to the Trust Service Provider.  2.3.4 Conformity Assessment Report  After successful completion of the audit (i.e. stages 1 and 2), the Conformity Assessment Body will issue a  conformity assessment report. This detailed report contains all results of the assessment performed and is  provided to the audited Trust Service Provider. The Trust Service Provider must in turn provide this report  to the responsible Supervisory Body within 3 working days. Only after a full review of the conformity  assessment report and any additional information requested from TSP which was necessary to verify  compliance with the requirements laid down in eIDAS regulation will the Supervisory Body decide whether  the Trust Service Provider and the trust services it provides comply with the requirements set out it the  RegulationMaximum 3 months after the submission of the conformity assessment report, the Trust Service  Provider will be notified with the decision from the Supervisory Body. If positive, the Trust Service Provider  and the audited trust services will be granted the “qualified” status and will be added to the national  trusted list by the responsible body, if not already within. In case a qualified Trust Service Provider and its  qualified trust services do not meet the requirements set out in the Regulation, the Supervisory Body will  not grant qualified status (in case of a new TSP/TS) or will withdraw the qualified status and inform the  body responsible for the national trusted list about its decision.  Conformity Assessment of Trust Service Providers  December 2017  15  3. Trust Service Providers’ Documentation  As part of its audit activities, the Conformity Assessment Body will request specific documentation  supporting the implementation of the Trust Service Providers organization. This documentation will be  reviewed at the first stage of the audit and will serve as a basis for the audit on-site performed during the  stage 2. In this sense, it is essential for Trust Service Providers to make sure the appropriate documents  such as plans, policies and procedures are defined and continuously updated following the Trust Service  Providers changes.  The purpose of this section is to present an overview of the typical documentation to be maintained by  Trust Services Providers following recognized frameworks and standards such as IETF, NIST or ETSI. Related  information and more specifically the policy and security requirements as well as technical specifications  for Trust Service Providers can be found in the document “Recommendations for TSPs based on Standards  ” created by ENISA.15  Plans  Plans are high-level statements that aim at providing a clear understanding of the long-term objectives  defined by the Trust Service Providers throughout the organization, and are periodically reviewed and  updated by the management. Trust Service Providers should create plans to cover the various aspects of  the organization such as the security, management of systems, business continuity, management of  incidents, etc.  3.1.1 Infrastructure Management Plan  In order to respond to the continuous system evolution, Trust Service Providers should define a plan to  manage and monitor the entire infrastructure, including the following components:   the servers (CPU, storage, memory, etc.);   the databases (table spaces, data files, file systems);   the networking devices;   the security controls (firewalls, IPSs).  3.1.2 Organization Structure  An organization exists as a system of coordinated activities accomplishing its defined goals and objectives  according to the defined strategy. The structure of a Trust Service Provider is managed in a hierarchical  manner, where well defined and repetitive tasks are set at the lower level and more flexibility to perform  higher priority tasks are set at the higher level.  For this purpose, clear roles and responsibilities must be defined and assigned to personnel, based on their  place in the hierarchy, in order to perform their tasks efficiently. It should also include recommendations  enforcing security measures as well as methods to maintain the personnel discipline.  3.1.3 Security Plan  A security plan supports Trust Service Providers in ensuring the continuous protection of their IT resources  by providing a clear overview of the security requirements and describing the management, operational as  15 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/trust-services/guidelines  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/trust-services/guidelines  Conformity Assessment of Trust Service Providers  December 2017  16  well as technical controls in place. The plan should also address the roles and responsibilities regarding the  access to the resources and the associated authorizations.  For the creation of security plan, Trust Service Providers should follow existing standards such as ISO/IEC  2700116 and make sure it is aligned with other plans such as the risk management plan, business continuity  plan or incident management plan.  3.1.4 Communication Plan  In order to ensure an efficient exchange of all the required information internally but also outside the  organization (e.g. with customers), Trust Service Providers must have a dedicated communication plan in  place.  This plan presents the type of information published and the way this is done, but also defines the target  audience as well as potential impacts on the Trust Service Providers and provided trust services.  Based on the target audience and the type of information to be communicated, Trust Service Providers  may categorize communication as follows:   internal communication (e.g. to employees);   business communication (e.g. to customers);   emergency communication;   media communication;   shareholders communication.  Internal communication will follow procedures that differ from the ones used for external communications  (e.g. announcement of a new product).  3.1.5 Risk Management Plan  As the networked world continues to shape and impact every aspect of our lives, threats to the global  industry continue in parallel.  For this purpose, Trust Service Providers must have an appropriate risk management plan in place to  support the identification and evaluation of emerging risks and the implementation of appropriate controls  to avoid them.  Technical guidelines regarding the conduction of a risk assessment on Trust Service Providers as part of the  eIDAS Regulation can be found in the document “Recommendations for TSPs based on Standards  ”  created by ENISA. 17  3.1.6 Business Continuity Plan  In order to ensure the preservation of its business (e.g. trust services) during and after a disaster, Trust  Service Providers should have a well-defined business continuity plan (including disaster recovery plan and  contingency plan) as part of its response planning.  16 http://www.iso.org/iso/iso27001  17 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/trust-services/guidelines  http://www.iso.org/iso/iso27001 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/trust-services/guidelines  Conformity Assessment of Trust Service Providers  December 2017  17  This plan aims at describing all the arrangements foreseen by the Trust Service Providers, including  processes and procedures, to recover as quickly as possible from any kind of major disruption regarding its  network or its systems and continue to provide its services.  The business continuity plan should be maintained, tested and be subject of training. As part of its  implementation, this plan will require the creation of two other plans: a disaster recovery plan and a  contingency plan.  3.1.6.1 Disaster Recovery Plan (DRP)  The disaster recovery plan defines the technical and functional requirements to protect the IT  infrastructure of Trust Service Providers and restore its operability following a disaster.  Analysis and availability of critical recovery resources is important in order to develop the ongoing  recovery cost estimates. There should be specific recovery strategies defined for IT as well as business  processes.  Some requirements to consider regarding the IT infrastructure include:   systems hardware resources;   systems data storage requirements;   unique (i.e. nonstandard) hardware resources;   distributed systems (e.g. workstations, extranet, intranet, etc.).  3.1.6.2 Contingency Plan  A contingency plan defines all the interim measures, such as the relocation of systems to a back-up site,  which are in place to help Trust Service Providers recover from a disaster and ensure the continuation of  its services. This plan can include several phases including detection, notification, evaluation and  resolution, which must be described and checked.  3.1.7 Incident Management Plan  Trust Service Providers should have a plan to manage incidents impacting their infrastructure and that can  affect the normal operation of the services provided., This plan should include specific information such as  the incident category as well as  the measures to mitigate the impact and prevent further damage to the  Trust Service Providers operations.  It is recommended that Trust Service Providers align this incident management plan with other plans such  as the business continuation plan as part of the response operations.  3.1.8 Training Plan  Given the complexity of Trust Service Providers environment, all personnel (e.g. employees,  subcontractors) should be educated and receive guidance for the most important aspects of Trust Service  Providers operations. For this purpose, the Trust Service Providers should define a clear plan describing the  type of trainings required and how they can be given according to the target audience.  Many topics that should be covered by the training plan, including:   corporate policies;   regulatory compliance;   business continuity and disaster recovery;   risk management;  Conformity Assessment of Trust Service Providers  December 2017  18   physical and logical infrastructure.  Moreover, the training plan should inform personnel about their roles and responsibilities as well as the  surrounding expectations.  3.1.9 Legal Enforcement Plan  TPSs should have a clear plan to address the major legal obligations at national and international level,  which can affect the services provided.  Besides the eIDAS Regulation, Trust Service Providers may be subject to other applicable laws such as:   national laws related to electronic signatures;   personal data protection laws;   contract laws.  3.1.10 Access Control Plan  Trust Service Providers should have a clear and agreed plan regarding control of personnel access to the IT  resources, as either logical (e.g. systems, databases) or physical (e.g. facilities), in order to prevent  undesired access.  This plan should describe the requirements (i.e. type of users, resources to access, operations to perform,  etc.) and controls in place to restrict access and therefore ensure the protection of the resources.  3.1.11 Termination Plan  Trust Service Providers providing qualified trust services should have an up-to-date termination plan18 to  ensure continuity of service in accordance with provisions verified by the supervisory body under point (i)  of Article 17(4).  Thus, aiming to ensure sustainability and durability of qualified trust services and to boost users’  confidence in the continuity of qualified trust services, supervisory bodies should verify the existence and  the correct application of provisions on termination plans in cases where qualified trust service providers  cease their activities.  Policies  Policies are principles, rules or guidelines established and adopted by Trust Service Providers to influence  or determine the way of proceeding in specific cases or areas.  It should be noted that any creation or update to existing policies should be reviewed and receive the  approval from the responsible Internal Governance Body before its publication. Trust Service Providers  should define a similar body which is responsible for the control and the maintenance of all the policies  and practices (e.g. CP/CPS) within the organization, as well as the review of audit results to check policy  compliance.  3.2.1 Security Policy  The security policy is the main policy in place regarding the objectives of an organization to protect its  assets. This policy defines the main rules set by the organization and to be followed in order to ensure the  security of all IT resources, facilities but also personnel within the organization.  18 http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32014R0910&from=EN  Conformity Assessment of Trust Service Providers  December 2017  19  Trust Service Providers should write a security policy covering specific areas such as:   Risk Management;   Disaster Recovery;   User Responsibilities;   Internet and E-mail Policies;   Password Policies.  3.2.2 Access Control Policy  The access control policy defines the rules set by an organization regarding the access to its IT resources by  all entities within or outside the organization (e.g. employees, customers).  Trust Service Providers should develop an access control policy to clearly set the requirements regarding  the identification, authentication, authorization and monitoring of who or what is accessing specific  resources in order to protect the company from threats and vulnerabilities, related to undesired access to  the Trust Service Providers assets.  3.2.3 Certificate Policy and Certification Practice Statement  The X.509 standard defines a Certificate Policy (CP) as “a named set of rules that indicates the applicability  of a certificate to a particular community and/or class of application with common security requirements”.  In general, as mentioned above, there are two major categories of CPs:   Focused on indication applicability of a certificate to a particular community (e.g. geographical  region, specific market or finance, assurance, etc.).   Focused on indication applicability of a certificate to a class of application with common security  requirements (e.g. different level of security and level of assurance).  The CP can be represented in a certificate by a unique number called an Object Identifier (OID) which can  be registered and assigned to a particular organization.  The DSG defines a Certification Practice Statement (CPS) as “a statement of the practices which a  certification authority employs in issuing certificates”19.  In other words, the CPS establishes the practices used by a CA regarding the management of the  certificates lifecycle (e.g. certificate issuance, revocation, re-key, etc.).  While the CP defines the requirements and appropriate usage for the certificate types issued by the PKI,  the CPS states the PKI actors, their roles and duties, and describes the practice employed by the CA  following best practices and requirements defined in the CP.  The RFC 3647 “Internet X.509 Public Key Infrastructure Certification Policy and Certification Practices  Framework\"20 provides some guidance and the recommended structure for the creation of a CP and/or  CPS:  19 American Bar Association, Digital Signature Guidelines: Legal Infrastructure for Certification Authorities and Secure  Electronic Commerce, 1996.  20 https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3647.txt  Conformity Assessment of Trust Service Providers  December 2017  20  1.

Facilities, Management, and Operational Controls  6. Technical Security Controls  7. Certificate, CRL, and OCSP Profile  8. Compliance Audit and Other Assessments  9. Other Business and Legal Matters  Trust Service Providers willing to issue qualified certificates can follow the ETSI EN 319 411-2 “Electronic  Signatures and Infrastructures (ESI); Policy and security requirements for Trust Service Providers issuing  certificates; Part 2: Requirements for trust service providers issuing EU qualified certificates”21. This  standard supports Trust Service Providers in the writing of their CP and/or CPS by providing the general  policy and security requirements that meet the requirements set out in the eIDAS Regulation, including  Articles 19, 24, 28, 38 and 45.  The CP and CPS constitute both a basis for most of audits, accreditations, and other assessments of a Trust  Service Providers.  3.2.4 Archive Policy  The archive policy is an internal document maintained by Trust Service Providers to define the rules  regarding the archival of critical information, due to either business or legal requirements.  This policy sets the rules regarding the archival process, specific to the type of data to be archived. It  includes information such as the archiving criteria, mechanism and storage used, retention period as well  as the people authorized to perform the archive.  Procedures  Procedures are step-by-step instructions to be followed in order to perform specifics tasks. They support  the implementation of the plans and policies defined by the Trust Service Providers in a consistent and  regular basis by providing clarity and a common understanding of the operations. Usually, procedures  come along with well-defined roles and responsibilities.  In order to reduce the risks that important steps, communication and required deliverables are left out,  procedures should be best developed with input of interfacing areas. Moreover the associated  documentation should be consistent in order to give the ability to improve and facilitate the review of the  procedures in place.  3.3.1 Operations Security  Operations security procedures aim at supporting Trust Service Providers in ensuring the security of their  operations by protecting and controlling their information assets.  Moreover, these procedures should encompass all the required tasks in order to ensure the availability of  all IT resources.  Operations security procedures can be divided into different areas such as:  21 http://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_en/319400_319499/31941102/02.01.01_60/en_31941102v020101p.pdf  Conformity Assessment of Trust Service Providers  December 2017  21   roles and responsibilities for trusted personnel operators (e.g. system/security admins, auditors);   resources protection (e.g. facilities, hardware, software);   continuity of operations (e.g. business continuity and disaster recovery);   change control management.  3.3.2 Change Control Management  Trust Service Providers systems require frequent changes, due to software packages added, removed or  modified, or because of the introduction of new hardware.  This rapid advancement of technology requires proper change management control procedures in order to  perform maintenance activities in a controlled way and ensure the integrity of the necessary systems.  Trust Service Providers should indicate the scope of the affecting system(s) (e.g. on test, production) and  of the kind of modification (e.g. permanent changes, temporary changes, emergency changes) and the  procedure associated to it. All these requirements should be defined accordingly and a responsible person  should be designated for every asset. These procedures should have a workflow including at least:   identification of the change (e.g. affected services);   technical evaluation and risks associated to the change;   approval of the change;   information of the change (e.g. according to the communication policy);   execution of the change;   new testing to validate the change.  For recovery and integrity purposes, a detailed inventory of the hardware and software is necessary.  3.3.3 Risk Assessment  Risk assessment procedures should provide all the requirements for assessing risks with regards to Trust  Service Providers operations. These procedures should support personnel in identifying, understanding  and evaluating the risks in order to take the appropriate actions to tackle them using the appropriate  measures. In order to keep track of actions taken and leave room for improvement, all identified risks as  well as relevant associated information should be recorded for further analysis.  For information on the risk analysis procedure, please consult ENISA guidelines published in 201322.  3.3.4 Network Security  Network security includes the structures, transport methods and formats, as well as all security measures  in place to ensure integrity, availability and confidentiality of all Trust Service Providers’ data transferred  over private and public networks.  Since any loss of network connectivity, internally or externally, may have disastrous consequences,  ensuring network security is one of the main keys for Trust Service Providers.  Procedures associated to network security should consist of a list of specific actions to be executed at  different levels, including:   physical and logical network protection (e.g. network segmentation, configuration of network  security devices, security patches, permissions granting);  22 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/identity-and-trust/trust-services/guidelines-tsp  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/identity-and-trust/trust-services/guidelines-tsp  Conformity Assessment of Trust Service Providers  December 2017  22   trusted roles and system accounts (e.g. roles and responsibilities, access control);   logs, monitoring and alerts (e.g. network infrastructure monitoring, alerts configuration, logging  records, vulnerabilities detection).  3.3.5 Incident Response  Incident response procedures define all the precise steps to be followed in order to address and manage  the consequences of an incident (e.g. security breach) and mitigate its impact, according to the defined  plan. The procedures should indicate all the details required to appropriately handle a specific type of  incident, including:   level of importance;   response time;   responsible people;   communication needs.  Evidence management  Evidence is collected with the purpose of providing details regarding an event and demonstrating the  effectiveness of associated procedures. Measurement of this information provides the ability to improve  the procedures.  3.4.1 Evidence Documentation  For every defined plans, policies and procedures, Trust Service Providers should obtain evidence that the  related documents are consistently followed up. For this purpose, tools can support the Trust Service  Providers in the execution of specific tasks, and provide efficient management of all analogous  information.  For example, there are tools supporting the execution of risk analysis or the management of Trust Service  Providers assets (i.e. their location, owners, characteristics, etc.).  3.4.2 Testing  All tests performed within the Trust Service Providers infrastructure should be documented along with all  associated information and the required level of detail (e.g. test type, plan testing, quality status, etc.).  3.4.3 Agreements and Contracts  All contracts and agreements such as NDAs, SLAs and confidentiality agreements, between Trust Service  Providers and their employees, customers or other third parties should be maintained and kept in a safe  place in order to protect the company in case of dispute.  3.4.4 Evaluation Reports  In order to ensure the effectiveness and proper functioning of the resources, evaluation of all hardware  and software in place at the Trust Service Providers should be performed on a regular basis, generating  evaluation reports as well as evidence that should be recorded. Evaluation reports can also be generated  following other kinds of activities such as personnel trainings (e.g. tests) or audits (e.g. findings).  3.4.5 Event Logs  Logging events can help the Trust Service Providers track issues and find the root causes in case of  incidents such as system failures or security breaches. For this purpose, all the logs generated by a system  with regards to specific events should be recorded and stored accordingly by the Trust Service Providers.  Conformity Assessment of Trust Service Providers  December 2017  23  3.4.6 Regulatory Compliance  In order to show compliance with the eIDAS Regulation as well  as, where applicable, other national or  international laws, all relevant evidence that can be used as a proof of compliance should be recorded and  stored by the Trust Service Providers.  Conformity Assessment of Trust Service Providers  December 2017  24  4. Trust Service Providers Organization  Trust Service Providers Services  This section describes the various component services related to the certification services. It focuses  mainly on certification services because they form the foundation of all trust services under the eIDAS  Regulation, such as electronic signatures, seals or time stamps. Any Trust Service Provider willing to  provide qualified trust services will first have to make sure its certification service or its third-party service  provider fulfils all the requirements set out in the eIDAS Regulation regarding the issuance of qualified  certificates for the defined purpose. The subdivision of services is only for the purposes of clarification and  does not place any restrictions on the implementation of the Trust Service Providers services.  4.1.1 Registration Service  The registration service verifies the identity and if applicable, any specific attributes of a subject. The  results of this service are passed to the certificate generation service (section 4.1.2).  This service is often provisioned by a Registration Authority (RA), which has formal agreement with the  Certification Authority (CA) to identify and authenticate the certificate subjects, verify the documentation  accrediting the circumstances appearing in the certificates and validate the requests to issue, revoke or  renew certificates.  The RA should assume the following obligations:   Validating the identity and other personal details of the subject of the certificates or information  relevant for the purpose of the certificates in accordance with the associated procedures.   Maintaining all information and documentation concerning certificates, and managing their  issuance, renewal, revocation and reactivation.   Notifying the CA of certificate revocation requests with due diligence and in a fast and reliable  manner.   Informing the CA of all issuance, renewal and reactivation requests, and any other aspects of  certificate management.   Validating with due diligence the circumstances for revocation that might affect the certificate  validity.   Performing its certificate management operations in compliance with the procedures established  by the Trust Service Providers and current legislation.   Where applicable, making available to the subject the technical procedures for signature creation  data (i.e. the private key) and electronic signature verification (i.e. the public key).  The process associated to the proper identification of the subscriber is the responsibility of the Trust  Service Providers, and should be performed prior to the issuance of the certificate.  The certificate will only be issued if this process is completed successfully, otherwise the RA will refuse the  request and inform the applicant of the reasons.  4.1.2 Certificate Generation Service  Subscriber certificates can be issued either by means of a cryptographic device or a software mechanism.  4.1.2.1 Cryptographic Device  The typical issuance procedure for certificates issued using a cryptographic device is the following:  Conformity Assessment of Trust Service Providers  December 2017  25  1. The RA verifies the validity of the documentation submitted by the applicant.  2. Following the applicant authentication, the RA requests a certificate from the CA.  3. The CA issues the certificate to the RA following the established procedures.  4. The RA securely downloads the certificate on the signature creation device.  4.1.2.2 Software Mechanism  The issuance procedure for certificates issued using a software mechanism is the following:  1. The RA verifies the validity of the documentation submitted by the applicant.  2. Together with the application form, the applicant generates a key pair giving the public key.  3. After receiving the documentation and the public key, the CA issues the certificate.  4. The private key and the certificate are stored on the cryptographic device or on the computer of the  subscriber.  4.1.3 Subject Device Provision Service  The subject device provision service is an optional service which aims at preparing, and providing or  making available secure cryptographic devices, or other secure devices, to subjects.  4.1.4 Dissemination Service  The purpose of the dissemination service is to disseminate the certificates to subjects, and in case of  subject consents, make them available to relying parties. This service also makes available the Trust Service  Providers terms and conditions as well as any published policy and practice information (e.g. CP/CPS) to  subscribers and relying parties.  Depending on the method used to issue the certificate, the associated private key will be delivered to the  entities in a different way:   If the certificate is issued on a cryptographic hardware device (section 4.1.2.1), the private key is  delivered on the cryptographic device.   If the certificate is issued on a software mechanism (section 4.1.2.2), the private key is generated  by the server and does not need to be delivered.  4.1.5 Revocation Management Service  The revocation management service processes requests and reports relating to revocation to determine  the necessary action to be taken. The results of this service are distributed through the revocation status  service.  Various reasons can lead to the revocation of certificates, which can vary according to the nature of the  certificate (i.e. subscriber or CA certificate).  Trust Service Providers must provide a process for subscribers to request the revocation of their certificate,  which should be described in the available CP/CPS. The qualified Trust Service Providers shall maintain a  continuous 24x7 ability to accept and respond to revocation requests and related inquiries.  In regards to private key compromise, certificate misuse and other types of fraud or inappropriate  conduct, the Trust Service Providers must provide third parties with clear instructions for reporting  through readily accessible online means.  For instance, some reasons to request the revocation of a certificate may the following:   loss or compromise of the private key;  Conformity Assessment of Trust Service Providers  December 2017  26   legal or administrative order;   subscriber employment termination.  4.1.6 Revocation Status Service  The certification revocation status service provides certificate status information to relying parties, either  based upon revocation lists or using an online service providing status information on an individual basis.  The two common schemes for certificate status validation are: Certificate Revocation Lists (CRL) and Online  Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP).  As required by the eIDAS Regulation (Article 24), every request for the revocation of a qualified certificate  must be handled by the Trust Service Providers and the new status published at maximum 24 hours after  the receipt. The revocation becomes effective immediately after its publication.  4.1.6.1 Certificate Revocation List (CRL)  A CRL is a time-stamped list containing all the revoked certificates which is signed by the issuing CA (or  another CRL issuer) and made available through a public repository.  There are some recommendations that a CRL for end entity certificates should be issued at least every 24  hours or when a revocation occurs, and should be valid for 10 days.  All recommended specifications regarding the management of CRLs can be found in the RFC 5280.  4.1.6.2 Online Certificate Service Protocol (OCSP)  Trust Service Providers may also provide third parties with a real-time online service based on OCSP, which  allows to immediately verify the status of a certificate. This service should be available 24 hours a day, 7  days a week. OCSP responses are signed either by the CA who issued the certificate or the OCSP  responder.  All recommended specifications regarding the protocol OCSP can be found in the RFC 6960.  Trust Service Provider Infrastructure  As part of the requirements form the eIDAS Regulation, Trust Service Providers must address physical and  logical security related to their infrastructure using all appropriate countermeasures as well as defensive  and recovery strategies. Further information regarding the infrastructure of Trust Service Providers and  trust services (including entities, assets and processes to be protected) can be found within the other  technical guideline documents developed by ENISA23.  Personnel Security  Trust Service Providers should implement procedures for personnel regarding security issues and how to  proceed accordingly. Specific procedures regarding “trusted roles”24 should be clearly defined by Trust  Service Providers, along with the associated tasks to be performed.  In order to make sure that people with trusted roles perform their corresponding duties properly, the  following considerations should be addressed by Trust Service Providers:  23 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/trust-services/guidelines  24 A trusted role is defined as a set of responsibilities assigned to a person, and that can lead to security problems if  not performed satisfactorily, either accidentally or maliciously.  Conformity Assessment of Trust Service Providers  December 2017  27   The technology is designed and configured in order to prevent errors and improper conduct.   The duties are distributed among several individuals so that any action must be approved by at  least two people.  The Trust Service Providers should make available a full inventory of all the roles carried out in the  organization, along with associated duties and responsibilities. Each of these roles should come with a  clear definition as well as a set of documented procedures.  4.3.1 Personnel controls  Trust Service Providers should implement several controls regarding the personnel requirements and  needs:   Background, qualification and experience (i.e. personnel should have the required experience and  qualification to perform their job);   Training (i.e. provide personnel with the required trainings and maintain records);   Retraining (i.e. new training plan following any significant change to CA operations);   Sanction for unauthorized actions (i.e. internal disciplinary regime defining the sanction against  personnel);   Contracting personnel (i.e. maintenance of specific policies regarding contracting personnel);   Documentation (i.e. provide all personnel with required Trust Service Providers documentation  such as CP/CPS, operations manuals, etc.).

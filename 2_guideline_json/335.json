    "document(english)": "ENISA ETL2020 - Emerging Trends  From January 2019 to April 2020  Emerging  trends ENISA Threat Landscape  Overview  With the start of a new decade, we can expect significant changes in the  way we perceive and understand cybersecurity or the security of  cyberspace. Cyberspace as defined in ISO/IEC 27032:20121 is a “complex  environment resulting from the interaction of people, software and  services on the Internet by means of technology devices and networks  connected to it, which does not exist in any physical form”. The  protection of this complex environment will become even more  challenging as we connect more people, devices, systems and run more  processes and services in the network. We are also more dependent  from its reliability, integrity, availability and trustworthiness to work,  relate and do many of our day-to-day activities. With this growing  dependency, more opportunities will arise for malicious actors to use  cyberspace to manipulate, intimidate, deceive, harass and defraud  individuals and organisations. The protection of individuals, business and  organisations while using cyberspace will tend to shift during the next  decade, from the traditional network and information security (NIS) to a  wider concept including content and services.  During the last decade the ‘fourth industrial revolution'  has significantly accelerated the pace of change,  transforming what people do, how they do it, what skills  are required, where work is performed, how work  relations are structured, and how work is organised,  distributed and rewarded.  _What to expect  2  Because of the current COVID-19 pandemic, we initiate the decade  with a new norm and profound changes in the physical world and  cyberspace. With social distancing or confinement, people will tend to  use the virtual space to communicate, relate and socialize. This new norm  will introduce new challenges across the digital value-chain and in  particularly, the cybersecurity industry.  During the next decade, cybersecurity risks will become  harder to assess and interpret due to the growing  complexity of the threat landscape, adversarial ecosystem  and expansion of the attack surface.  There are too many variables to consider when making cyber risk  management effective. An important factor is the technological diversity  most organisations experience today. Another aspect is the sophistication  of tools, tactics techniques and procedures (TTPs) used by adversaries to  conduct attacks. Malicious actors are adapting and adjusting the TTPs to  their victim’s environment as needed and collaborating with others to  reach their goals.  Defining a risk posture, managing data, applying relevant metrics, and  responding to change are obstacles to creating an effective cyber risk  governance strategy. New approaches will be required during the next  decade to stay away from silo analysis and move closer to a matrix-  type of interconnected factors, variables and conditions. This  constitutes a significant challenge for many organisations trying to protect  their infrastructure, operations and data against stronger, better  resourced and equipped adversaries.  3  01_Dealing with systemic and complex  risks. Cyber risk is characterised by the speed and scale of its  propagation as well as the potential intent of threat actors. The  interconnectedness of various systems and networks enables  cyber incidents to spread quickly and widely, making cyber risks  harder to assess and mitigate.  02_Widespread of adversarial AI detection.  The detection of threats exploiting AI to launch an attack or avoid  detection will constitute a major challenge for the future of cyber  defence systems.14  03_Reduction of unintentional errors. With  the growing number of systems and devices connected to the  network, unintentional errors continues to be one of the most  exploited vulnerability in cybersecurity incidents. New solutions  aiming at the reduction of these errors will provide an important  contribution to reducing the number of incidents.  04_Supply chain and third party threats. The  diversified supply chain that characterizes the technology  industry today provides new opportunities for threat actors to  take advantage of these complex systems and exploit the  multiple vulnerabilities introduced by a heterogeneous  ecosystem of third party providers.16  05_Security orchestration and automation. Cyber threat intelligence and behavioural analytics will gain  importance with the automation of processes and analysis.  Investing in automation and orchestration will allow  cybersecurity professionals to invest in the design of more  robust cybersecurity strategies.  __Ten cybersecurity challenges  Emerging trends  4  06_Reduction of false positives. This long waited  promise is key in the future of the cybersecurity industry and in  the fight against the alarm fatigue.  07_Zero-trust security strategies. With an  increasing pressure on IT systems from new business  requirements such as remote working, digitalization of the  business model and data sprawl, zero trust is seen by many  decision makers as the solution de facto to secure corporate  assets.  08_Enterprise cloud migration errors. With  many businesses migrating their data to cloud-based solutions,  the number of configuration errors will increase exposing data to  a potential breach. Cloud service providers will address the issue  by implementing systems that identify these type of errors  automatically.  09_Hybrid threats. New modus operandi adopt virtual  and physical world threats. The spread of disinformation or fake  news for example, is a key fixture of the hybrid threat landscape.  The EUvsDisinfo15 is a flagship project of the European External  Action Service’s East StratCom Task Force established to address  the disinformation threat.  10_The attractiveness of the cloud  infrastructure as a target will grow. The  increasing reliance on public cloud infrastructure will surge the  risk of outages. Misconfiguration of cloud resources is still the  number one cause for cloud attacks, but attacks aiming directly  at the cloud services providers gaining popularity among  hackers.  5  Emerging trends  _ Cyber threat intelligence will help  defining cybersecurity strategies  Cyber threat intelligence (CTI) aims at helping organisations becoming  better prepared by improving their knowledge about the threat  landscape. Instead of relying exclusively on information generated by  internal systems or feeds (what is known about the known), the  effectiveness of CTI will be determined by the knowledge about the why,  the how and the what that is unknown to the cybersecurity team. The  value proposition of any CTI capability or program is to improve the  preparedness of the organisation to protect its critical assets from  unknown threats.  _ Cybersecurity spending  According to Gartner17, many boards of directors will demand improved  data and understanding of the returns after years of intensive investment  in cybersecurity. This is mainly due to a growing spend in cybersecurity  proportionately to the investment made in new technologies. According  to a report from IDC22, spending on cybersecurity reached $103 billion (ca.  €87,5 billion) in 2019, which is 9.4% higher than the previous year.  Security managers will soon be scrutinised for the results obtained from  years of investment and are essential to maintain improved data about  the results obtained.  6  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/threat-risk-management/threats-and-trends/etl-review-folder/etl2020-cti-overview  With more cybersecurity automation and orchestration seen as a growing  trend, cybersecurity teams will spend less time in monitoring  activities and more in readiness and preparedness tasks. A well-  designed CTI capability can provide contextualised and actionable  knowledge about threats to inform strategic, operational and tactical  stakeholders across the organisation. In practical terms, a CTI capability  should aim at responding to the following questions considering the  stakeholders’ requirements and the organisation’s context and  environment:   What is the attack surface?   What are the most valuable assets and the cyber terrain?   What are the most critical vulnerabilities?   What are the most used attack vectors?   How adversaries typically behave and operate?   How does the threat landscape looks like for:   the sector and type of business the organisation operates?   the technological environment adopted by the organisation?   Who and what needs to be done to mitigate risks from these threats?  _ Knowing the threat landscape  7  _ Shortage in cybersecurity skills  The lack of highly-skilled tech professionals is already issue for Europe’s  digitalisation ambition. According to a study23, over 70% of European firms  report that lack of skills is hampering their investment strategies, while  46% of firms report difficulties in filling vacancies due to skills shortages  in key areas such cybersecurity.  Emerging trends  __ Five trends with cyber  threats01_Malware is getting an upgrade. Malware family strains are  being upgraded into new versions with additional features, distribution and  propagation mechanisms. Emotet for example, a malware originally  designed as a banking Trojan back in 2014, has become one of the most  effective malware distributors of 2019.  2  02_Threats will become fully mobile. Users are increasingly  dependent on mobile devices to secure their most sensitive accounts. The  use of 2fa tied to an app authenticator or via a text message is one of the  examples. With more malware going fully mobile, fraudulent apps,  SIMJacking and operating systems exploits make these devices the weakest  link and therefore, extremely vulnerable to attacks.  03_Attackers are using new file types such as disc  image files (ISO and IMG) for spreading malware. DOC,  PDF, ZIP and XLS files are still the most commonly used attachment type for  spreading malware but other types are getting popular. A few campaigns  distributing AgentTesla InfoStealer and NanoCore RAT were found using  image file type in 2019.  04_Increase in targeted and coordinated ransomware  attacks. In 2019, we saw an escalation of sophisticated and targeted  ransomware exploits with the public sector, health care organisations and  specific industries at the top of the list. Attackers are spending more time  gathering intelligence about their victims, knowing exactly what to encrypt,  achieving maximum disruption and higher ransoms.  05_Credential-stuffing attacks will widespread.  Credential stuffing - the automated injection of stolen username and  password combinations through large-scale automated login requests  directed against a web application - will proliferate as a result from a decade  of an abnormal number of data breaches and trillions of personal data  records stolen.  8  9  “During the next  decade, cybersecurity  risks will become  harder to assess and  interpret due to the  growing complexity of  the threat landscape,  adversarial ecosystem  and expansion of the  attack surface.” in ETL 2020  Emerging trends  01_Attacks will be massively distributed with a short  duration and a wider impact These attacks are meant to affect the highest number of devices possible to  steal personal information or block the access to data by encrypting the  files.  02_Finely targeted and persistent attacks will be  meticulously planned with well-defined and long-term  objectives Malicious actors plan this type of attacks to reach high value data such as  financial information, intellectual and industrial property, trade secrets,  classified information, etc.  03_Malicious actors will use digital platforms in targeted  attacks Malicious actors will explore the potential of digital platforms to support  targeted attacks (e.g. social media, gaming, messaging, streaming, etc.).  From personal data theft for spear-phishing attacks to broad malware  distribution, digital platforms with a high number of subscribers are  efficient attack vectors increasingly popular among malicious actors.  04_ The exploitation of business processes will increase  With more automation and less human intervention, business processes  can be maliciously altered to generate profit for an attacker. Commonly  known as Business Process Compromise (BPC) this technique is often  undervalued by process engineering specialists due to the lack of a proper  risk assessment.  05_ The attack surface will continue expanding  E-mail is no longer the prime and only tool and top attack vector for  phishing. Malicious actors are now using other platforms to communicate  and attract victims to open compromised web pages. A new trend is  emerging with the use of SMS, WhatsApp, SnapChat and social media  messengers.  __Ten emerging trends in attack  vectors  10  06_Teleworking will be exploited through home devices  With more people in teleworking and connecting their devices to corporate  networks, the risk of opening new entry points for attackers will increase.  With the COVID-19 pandemic, this trend will urge IT Managers to tighten  security policies and make urgent changes in the IT infrastructure.  07_Attackers will come better prepared  Attackers choose their targets carefully, perform reconnaissance against  specific employees, and target those with spear-phishing attacks to obtain  usable credentials to target the organisation. Once the attackers gain  access to a single machine, they may employ penetration-testing tools  such as Mimikatz to gather and exploit credentials with elevated privileges.  08_Obfuscation techniques will sophisticate  Threat actors are continuously innovating to make threats more effective  and less susceptible to detections. The Anibus, an Android banking Trojan  and bot, has been distributed by masquerading as innocuous app,  primarily through Google Play Store.1  09_ The automated exploitation of unpatched systems and  discontinued applications will increase The abnormal increase in Telnet traffic to port 445 observed in 2019  unveiled the expansion of worms and exploits such as Eternal Blue. Telnet,  which is no longer used except in the realm of IoT devices, saw the  greatest volumes during the period.  10_ Cyber threats are moving to the edge  Edge devices are deployed at the boundaries between interconnected  networks. We have seen a growing trend with attacks targeting these  devices — such as routers, switches, and firewalls — having a significant  impact to an enterprise and to the connected digital ecosystem.  11  References  12  1. “ISO/IEC 27032:2012”.

    "original document": "ENISA ETL2020 - Emerging Trends  From January 2019 to April 2020  Emerging  trends ENISA Threat Landscape  Overview  With the start of a new decade, we can expect significant changes in the  way we perceive and understand cybersecurity or the security of  cyberspace. Cyberspace as defined in ISO/IEC 27032:20121 is a “complex  environment resulting from the interaction of people, software and  services on the Internet by means of technology devices and networks  connected to it, which does not exist in any physical form”. The  protection of this complex environment will become even more  challenging as we connect more people, devices, systems and run more  processes and services in the network. We are also more dependent  from its reliability, integrity, availability and trustworthiness to work,  relate and do many of our day-to-day activities. With this growing  dependency, more opportunities will arise for malicious actors to use  cyberspace to manipulate, intimidate, deceive, harass and defraud  individuals and organisations. The protection of individuals, business and  organisations while using cyberspace will tend to shift during the next  decade, from the traditional network and information security (NIS) to a  wider concept including content and services.  During the last decade the ‘fourth industrial revolution'  has significantly accelerated the pace of change,  transforming what people do, how they do it, what skills  are required, where work is performed, how work  relations are structured, and how work is organised,  distributed and rewarded.  _What to expect  2  Because of the current COVID-19 pandemic, we initiate the decade  with a new norm and profound changes in the physical world and  cyberspace. With social distancing or confinement, people will tend to  use the virtual space to communicate, relate and socialize. This new norm  will introduce new challenges across the digital value-chain and in  particularly, the cybersecurity industry.  During the next decade, cybersecurity risks will become  harder to assess and interpret due to the growing  complexity of the threat landscape, adversarial ecosystem  and expansion of the attack surface.  There are too many variables to consider when making cyber risk  management effective. An important factor is the technological diversity  most organisations experience today. Another aspect is the sophistication  of tools, tactics techniques and procedures (TTPs) used by adversaries to  conduct attacks. Malicious actors are adapting and adjusting the TTPs to  their victim’s environment as needed and collaborating with others to  reach their goals.  Defining a risk posture, managing data, applying relevant metrics, and  responding to change are obstacles to creating an effective cyber risk  governance strategy. New approaches will be required during the next  decade to stay away from silo analysis and move closer to a matrix-  type of interconnected factors, variables and conditions. This  constitutes a significant challenge for many organisations trying to protect  their infrastructure, operations and data against stronger, better  resourced and equipped adversaries.  3  01_Dealing with systemic and complex  risks. Cyber risk is characterised by the speed and scale of its  propagation as well as the potential intent of threat actors. The  interconnectedness of various systems and networks enables  cyber incidents to spread quickly and widely, making cyber risks  harder to assess and mitigate.  02_Widespread of adversarial AI detection.  The detection of threats exploiting AI to launch an attack or avoid  detection will constitute a major challenge for the future of cyber  defence systems.14  03_Reduction of unintentional errors. With  the growing number of systems and devices connected to the  network, unintentional errors continues to be one of the most  exploited vulnerability in cybersecurity incidents. New solutions  aiming at the reduction of these errors will provide an important  contribution to reducing the number of incidents.  04_Supply chain and third party threats. The  diversified supply chain that characterizes the technology  industry today provides new opportunities for threat actors to  take advantage of these complex systems and exploit the  multiple vulnerabilities introduced by a heterogeneous  ecosystem of third party providers.16  05_Security orchestration and automation. Cyber threat intelligence and behavioural analytics will gain  importance with the automation of processes and analysis.  Investing in automation and orchestration will allow  cybersecurity professionals to invest in the design of more  robust cybersecurity strategies.  __Ten cybersecurity challenges  Emerging trends  4  06_Reduction of false positives. This long waited  promise is key in the future of the cybersecurity industry and in  the fight against the alarm fatigue.  07_Zero-trust security strategies. With an  increasing pressure on IT systems from new business  requirements such as remote working, digitalization of the  business model and data sprawl, zero trust is seen by many  decision makers as the solution de facto to secure corporate  assets.  08_Enterprise cloud migration errors. With  many businesses migrating their data to cloud-based solutions,  the number of configuration errors will increase exposing data to  a potential breach. Cloud service providers will address the issue  by implementing systems that identify these type of errors  automatically.  09_Hybrid threats. New modus operandi adopt virtual  and physical world threats. The spread of disinformation or fake  news for example, is a key fixture of the hybrid threat landscape.  The EUvsDisinfo15 is a flagship project of the European External  Action Service’s East StratCom Task Force established to address  the disinformation threat.  10_The attractiveness of the cloud  infrastructure as a target will grow. The  increasing reliance on public cloud infrastructure will surge the  risk of outages. Misconfiguration of cloud resources is still the  number one cause for cloud attacks, but attacks aiming directly  at the cloud services providers gaining popularity among  hackers.  5  Emerging trends  _ Cyber threat intelligence will help  defining cybersecurity strategies  Cyber threat intelligence (CTI) aims at helping organisations becoming  better prepared by improving their knowledge about the threat  landscape. Instead of relying exclusively on information generated by  internal systems or feeds (what is known about the known), the  effectiveness of CTI will be determined by the knowledge about the why,  the how and the what that is unknown to the cybersecurity team. The  value proposition of any CTI capability or program is to improve the  preparedness of the organisation to protect its critical assets from  unknown threats.  _ Cybersecurity spending  According to Gartner17, many boards of directors will demand improved  data and understanding of the returns after years of intensive investment  in cybersecurity. This is mainly due to a growing spend in cybersecurity  proportionately to the investment made in new technologies. According  to a report from IDC22, spending on cybersecurity reached $103 billion (ca.  €87,5 billion) in 2019, which is 9.4% higher than the previous year.  Security managers will soon be scrutinised for the results obtained from  years of investment and are essential to maintain improved data about  the results obtained.  6  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/threat-risk-management/threats-and-trends/etl-review-folder/etl2020-cti-overview  With more cybersecurity automation and orchestration seen as a growing  trend, cybersecurity teams will spend less time in monitoring  activities and more in readiness and preparedness tasks. A well-  designed CTI capability can provide contextualised and actionable  knowledge about threats to inform strategic, operational and tactical  stakeholders across the organisation. In practical terms, a CTI capability  should aim at responding to the following questions considering the  stakeholders’ requirements and the organisation’s context and  environment:   What is the attack surface?   What are the most valuable assets and the cyber terrain?   What are the most critical vulnerabilities?   What are the most used attack vectors?   How adversaries typically behave and operate?   How does the threat landscape looks like for:   the sector and type of business the organisation operates?   the technological environment adopted by the organisation?   Who and what needs to be done to mitigate risks from these threats?  _ Knowing the threat landscape  7  _ Shortage in cybersecurity skills  The lack of highly-skilled tech professionals is already issue for Europe’s  digitalisation ambition. According to a study23, over 70% of European firms  report that lack of skills is hampering their investment strategies, while  46% of firms report difficulties in filling vacancies due to skills shortages  in key areas such cybersecurity.  Emerging trends  __ Five trends with cyber  threats01_Malware is getting an upgrade. Malware family strains are  being upgraded into new versions with additional features, distribution and  propagation mechanisms. Emotet for example, a malware originally  designed as a banking Trojan back in 2014, has become one of the most  effective malware distributors of 2019.  2  02_Threats will become fully mobile. Users are increasingly  dependent on mobile devices to secure their most sensitive accounts. The  use of 2fa tied to an app authenticator or via a text message is one of the  examples. With more malware going fully mobile, fraudulent apps,  SIMJacking and operating systems exploits make these devices the weakest  link and therefore, extremely vulnerable to attacks.  03_Attackers are using new file types such as disc  image files (ISO and IMG) for spreading malware. DOC,  PDF, ZIP and XLS files are still the most commonly used attachment type for  spreading malware but other types are getting popular. A few campaigns  distributing AgentTesla InfoStealer and NanoCore RAT were found using  image file type in 2019.  04_Increase in targeted and coordinated ransomware  attacks. In 2019, we saw an escalation of sophisticated and targeted  ransomware exploits with the public sector, health care organisations and  specific industries at the top of the list. Attackers are spending more time  gathering intelligence about their victims, knowing exactly what to encrypt,  achieving maximum disruption and higher ransoms.  05_Credential-stuffing attacks will widespread.  Credential stuffing - the automated injection of stolen username and  password combinations through large-scale automated login requests  directed against a web application - will proliferate as a result from a decade  of an abnormal number of data breaches and trillions of personal data  records stolen.  8  9  “During the next  decade, cybersecurity  risks will become  harder to assess and  interpret due to the  growing complexity of  the threat landscape,  adversarial ecosystem  and expansion of the  attack surface.” in ETL 2020  Emerging trends  01_Attacks will be massively distributed with a short  duration and a wider impact These attacks are meant to affect the highest number of devices possible to  steal personal information or block the access to data by encrypting the  files.  02_Finely targeted and persistent attacks will be  meticulously planned with well-defined and long-term  objectives Malicious actors plan this type of attacks to reach high value data such as  financial information, intellectual and industrial property, trade secrets,  classified information, etc.  03_Malicious actors will use digital platforms in targeted  attacks Malicious actors will explore the potential of digital platforms to support  targeted attacks (e.g. social media, gaming, messaging, streaming, etc.).  From personal data theft for spear-phishing attacks to broad malware  distribution, digital platforms with a high number of subscribers are  efficient attack vectors increasingly popular among malicious actors.  04_ The exploitation of business processes will increase  With more automation and less human intervention, business processes  can be maliciously altered to generate profit for an attacker. Commonly  known as Business Process Compromise (BPC) this technique is often  undervalued by process engineering specialists due to the lack of a proper  risk assessment.  05_ The attack surface will continue expanding  E-mail is no longer the prime and only tool and top attack vector for  phishing. Malicious actors are now using other platforms to communicate  and attract victims to open compromised web pages. A new trend is  emerging with the use of SMS, WhatsApp, SnapChat and social media  messengers.  __Ten emerging trends in attack  vectors  10  06_Teleworking will be exploited through home devices  With more people in teleworking and connecting their devices to corporate  networks, the risk of opening new entry points for attackers will increase.  With the COVID-19 pandemic, this trend will urge IT Managers to tighten  security policies and make urgent changes in the IT infrastructure.  07_Attackers will come better prepared  Attackers choose their targets carefully, perform reconnaissance against  specific employees, and target those with spear-phishing attacks to obtain  usable credentials to target the organisation. Once the attackers gain  access to a single machine, they may employ penetration-testing tools  such as Mimikatz to gather and exploit credentials with elevated privileges.  08_Obfuscation techniques will sophisticate  Threat actors are continuously innovating to make threats more effective  and less susceptible to detections. The Anibus, an Android banking Trojan  and bot, has been distributed by masquerading as innocuous app,  primarily through Google Play Store.1  09_ The automated exploitation of unpatched systems and  discontinued applications will increase The abnormal increase in Telnet traffic to port 445 observed in 2019  unveiled the expansion of worms and exploits such as Eternal Blue. Telnet,  which is no longer used except in the realm of IoT devices, saw the  greatest volumes during the period.  10_ Cyber threats are moving to the edge  Edge devices are deployed at the boundaries between interconnected  networks. We have seen a growing trend with attacks targeting these  devices — such as routers, switches, and firewalls — having a significant  impact to an enterprise and to the connected digital ecosystem.  11  References  12  1. “ISO/IEC 27032:2012”.

The  General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR ) has reinforced the pre-existing provisions of  Directive 95/46/EC on security of personal data for data controllers and processors. The  Network and Information Systems Directive (NISD ) introduced obligations for operators of  essential services (OES) and for digital service providers (DSP), in an effort to achieve a  baseline, common level of information security within the European Union (EU) network and  information systems.  Over the previous years, ENISA has published several guidance documents for security  measures both in the context of the NISD, addressed to OESs and DSPs, and in the context of  the GDPR, addressed to controllers and processors. Based on these publications, this report  aims at providing a harmonized approach in using the available ENISA guidance, one that can  also be used by every organisation that plans to implement security measures appropriate for  the security of network and information systems as well as for personal data protection.  Although both NISD and GDPR follow a risk-based approach, the entities under the scope of  these provisions should take into account the differences arising from: a) the scope of each  legal instrument, b) the notion of risk within each legal instrument (e.g. risk for the organization  and the risk for the individual), b) the purpose of deploying security measures, d) the (security)  incidents under consideration and e) additional requirements, further to the risk assessment,  imposed (e.g. Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) which might be required under GDPR  and pertains risk assessment),. The report establishes that, in practice, there is no conflict  between these acts.  In order to support organisations in their process of identifying appropriate security measures,  based on the provisions of both NISD and GDPR, this report uses as basis the pre-existing  ENISA guidance and presents a mapping of already identified security objectives, between the  NISD and the GDPR.  The report should be used as a starting point for the above-mentioned assessment and is  targeted mainly to OESs and DSPs. Following the analysis in Sections 2, 3 and 4, this report  concludes that organisations could benefit from a unified risk management framework,  specialized sectorial guidance and specialised guidance on emerging privacy and security  techniques. It also proposes that a method of cooperation between competent NISD and GDPR  authorities as well as a co-ordinated approach on certifications concerning information security  issues would be beneficial for the Digital Single Market.  Finally the report concludes a set of key recommendations which summarise as follows:   NIS Competent Bodies and Data Protection Authorities should promote a common risk  management framework risk because both NISD and GDPR follow a risk-based  approach and managing risk can be achieved through one process.   NIS Competent Bodies and Data Protection competent Authorities should follow a  sector specific approach whenever this is required which takes into account the  specific needs for information security as well as for data protection of the sector.   Research Community and ENISA should continue to provide specialised guidance on  emerging data protection and security techniques.  This report aims  at providing a  harmonized  approach in  using the  available ENISA  guidance on how  to implement  security  measures for  network and  information  systems as well  as for personal  data protection.  STOCK TAKING OF SECURITY REQUIREMENTS SET BY DIFFERENT LEGAL  FRAMEWORKS ON OES AND DSPS  NOVEMBER 2019  6   NIS Competent Bodies as well as Data Protection Authorities, under the active  leadership of European Commission should establish a method of collaboration in  order to achieve consistency   NIS Competent Bodies as well as Data Protection Authorities in collaboration with  ENISA and European Commission should promote the collaboration of the NISD and  GDPR in the area of certification.  STOCK TAKING OF SECURITY REQUIREMENTS SET BY DIFFERENT LEGAL  FRAMEWORKS ON OES AND DSPS  NOVEMBER 2019  7  1. INTRODUCTION  1.1 BACKGROUND  In May 2018, both the GDPR and the NISD came into force. The GDPR introduces reinforced  information security requirements compared to Directive 95/46, for all organizations involved in  personal data processing operations affecting EU residents. The NISD includes provisions on  security requirements for OESs, designated per member state (MS) and DSPs, excluding micro  and small enterprises.  Both EU legislations contain security requirements and require organizations to mitigate security  breaches; however the focus of the NISD and the GDPR is different. The GDPR focuses on  security breaches of personal data with an impact on individuals’ rights and freedoms, while the  NISD focuses on network and information security breaches with an impact on the services of  OESs and DSPs.  The material scope of the NISD and the GDPR is also different. The GDPR applies to all  organizations processing personal data while the NISD applies only to a subset of (large)  companies. However, there are many organisations, which need to take into account both  security requirements; for example, organisations which are not in scope of the NISD, but are  delivering products and services to organisations in scope of this directive, say a small  enterprise in the supply chain of an OES.  Since both legal acts share a common information security background, many of the security  measures for OESs or DSPs under the NISD are also applicable for organizations under the  GDPR. For instance, both legal instruments necessitate in practice the use of an information  security management system and both follow a risk-based approach, even with a different  orientation with regards to the impact, as under NISD the level of risk is calculated taking into  account the impact on the organization while under GDPR the level of risk is calculated taking  into account the impact on the individual.  1.2 SCOPE AND OBJECTIVE  The target audience of this publication is the information security personnel of OESs and DSPs.  The objectives of this report are to:   demonstrate and analyse the different approaches of these two legislative documents  as per the security requirements of network and information systems; and   present a mapping of security objectives, between the NISD and the GDPR, based on  existing ENISA publications.  It should be noted that this report focuses solely on network and information security  requirements and should not be confused with requirements stemming from the data protection  by design and by default obligation of the GDPR Article 25 or from a data protection impact  assessment (DPIA - Article 35 GDPR) i.e. measures that are designed to implement, in an  effective manner, data-protection principles, such as data minimisation. Indeed, while, a risk  based approach, and deployment of relevant security measures, is part of the DPIA, additional  aspects that go beyond information security must be taken into account while conducting a  DPIA.  STOCK TAKING OF SECURITY REQUIREMENTS SET BY DIFFERENT LEGAL  FRAMEWORKS ON OES AND DSPS  NOVEMBER 2019  8  1.3 STRUCTURE  In section 2 an analysis of the legal framework for the NISD and the GDPR is presented,  focused on the requirements for the security of network and information systems. Overlaps and  gaps are identified and the main differences are pointed out. Section 3 provides a list of the  main guidance documents that have been produced by ENISA and the NISD Cooperation  Group, categorized by legal act.  Section 4 uses the aforementioned ENISA guidance to cover security requirements under both  NISD and GDPR Finally, in section 5 we provide a list of conclusions and recommendations for  future activities.  STOCK TAKING OF SECURITY REQUIREMENTS SET BY DIFFERENT LEGAL  FRAMEWORKS ON OES AND DSPS  NOVEMBER 2019  9  2. GAP ANALYSIS OF  SECURITY RELATED  PROVISIONS  2.1 THE EU LEGAL FRAMEWORK FOR THE SECURITY OF NETWORK  AND INFORMATION SYSTEMS  Article 14 of NISD requires that member states (MSs) ensure that “…operators of essential  services take appropriate and proportionate technical and organisational measures to manage  the risks posed to the security of network and information systems which they use in their  operations. Having regard to the state of the art, those measures shall ensure a level of security  of network and information systems appropriate to the risk posed.” Furthermore, art. 15 para 2  (b) requires that OES need to have in place an “effective implementation of security policies”.  In a similar way, Article 16 of NISD requires that MS ensure that “…digital service providers  identify and take appropriate and proportionate technical and organisational measures to  manage the risks posed to the security of network and information systems which they use in  the context of offering services referred to in Annex III within the Union. Having regard to the  state of the art, those measures shall ensure a level of security of network and information  systems appropriate to the risk posed, and shall take into account the following elements (a) the  security of systems and facilities; (b) incident handling; (c) business continuity management; (d)  monitoring, auditing and testing; (e) compliance with international standards.”  The Commission issued implementing Regulation (EU) 2018/1511to further specify the  elements that DSPs should take into account in order to manage the existing security risks of  their networks and information systems, as well as the parameters for determining whether an  incident has a significant impact or not.  For OES as well as for DSPs, the Directive aims to ensure the continuity of those services and  to build a culture of network and information systems security across sectors vital for our society  and economy and heavily dependent on ICT. NISD is applicable to industry sectors of Annex II  while DSP services are stated in Annex III. The security measures are applicable only to the  OES which will be designated as such by the MS. For this task, the Competent Authority (CA)  should follow a consistent approach that is based on national criteria for the determination of  what constitutes a significant disruptive effect. It is also evident that security requirements for  digital service providers are lighter. In addition, micro and small enterprises are exempted from  the NISD.  2.2 THE EU LEGAL FRAMEWORK FOR THE PROTECTION OF  PERSONAL DATA  Security of personal data was already established as a legal obligation for data controllers  under the Data Protection Directive 95/46/EC. GDPR reinforces the relevant provisions while  extending this responsibility directly to data processors.  Security of personal data (but with a particular focus on integrity and confidentiality) is elevated  in one of the principles relating to personal data processing (GDPR Article 5.1(f)). This puts  security at the core of data protection together with the rest of data protection principles, i.e.  1 http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg_impl/2018/151/oj  http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg_impl/2018/151/oj  STOCK TAKING OF SECURITY REQUIREMENTS SET BY DIFFERENT LEGAL  FRAMEWORKS ON OES AND DSPS  NOVEMBER 2019  10  lawfulness, fairness and transparency, purpose limitation, accuracy and storage limitation. The  addition of the accountability principle is also closely related to new obligations on security, as  undertakings need not only apply security measures, but also mandatorily document them, i.e.  through policies.  Section 2 of GDPR’s chapter IV, spanning 3 specific articles, establishes obligations for data  controllers and processors for the security of personal data processing including incident  handling. GDPR Article 32 provides that “Taking into account the state of the art, the costs of  implementation and the nature, scope, context and purposes of processing as well as the risk of  varying likelihood and severity for the rights and freedoms of natural persons, the controller and  the processor shall implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure a  level of security appropriate to the risk, including inter alia as appropriate: (a) the  pseudonymisation and encryption of personal data; (b) the ability to ensure the ongoing  confidentiality, integrity, availability and resilience of processing systems and services; (c) the  ability to restore the availability and access to personal data in a timely manner in the event of a  physical or technical incident; (d) a process for regularly testing, assessing and evaluating the  effectiveness of technical and organisational measures for ensuring the security of the  processing.”  In the subsequent paragraph the article further defines the above introduced risk based  approach, providing, in essence, risk factors: “in assessing the appropriate level of security  account shall be taken in particular of the risks that are presented by data processing, in  particular from accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorised disclosure of, or  access to personal data transmitted, stored or otherwise processed”. It also mentions the use of  codes of conduct or certification mechanisms (as regulated in Article 41 GDPR) to demonstrate  compliance with the requirements for the security of processing. Last, it states that the controller  in primis and consequently the processor are responsible for their personnel as they are  required to take steps to ensure that any natural person acting under their authority and who  has access to personal data does not process them except on instructions from the controller,  unless he or she is required to do so by Union or Member State law2.  It is worthwhile mentioning that the GDPR not only uses the classic CIA triad (confidentiality,  integrity, availability) but also introduces “resilience” as the fourth constituent part of security.  This recognises that reliability (e.g. fault tolerance, absence of single points of failure) of  information systems processing personal data are important for the development of the digital  economy and for the provision of services to EU residents. A perfect example for that argument  is the importance of DSPs, as mentioned in NISD. For their proper functioning, these systems  need also to withstand and recover from disruptions.  2.3 THE SECURITY PROVISIONS IN NISD AND GDPR  From the previous analysis it is evident that both legal texts follow a risk-based approach. This  is not surprising. OESs and DSPs activities under the scope of the NISD and most personal  data processing operations are carried out through information systems and networks. The  principles of information security risk management are applied in both cases in order to identify,  quantify and manage the security risks that an organisation faces. To be able to identify  differences and similarities, we need to look at the purpose and scope of each legal act and  check the following four factors:  1. Risks stemming from each legal act  2. The purpose of security measures  3. The scope of each legal act  2 For an introduction to information security and risk management, examining the specificities for personal data processing see (ENISA, 2016B)  STOCK TAKING OF SECURITY REQUIREMENTS SET BY DIFFERENT LEGAL  FRAMEWORKS ON OES AND DSPS  NOVEMBER 2019  11  4. Security incidents under consideration  2.3.1  A risk-based approach  The NISD explicitly defines risk as “any reasonably identifiable circumstance or event having a  potential adverse effect on the security of network and information systems” (Article 4.9 NISD).  Incidents can impede the pursuit of economic activities, generate substantial financial losses,  undermine user confidence and cause major damage to the smooth functioning of the economy  within the Union. From the above, it is evident that the directive recognises that reliability and  security of network and information systems and services are essential to economic and  societal activities, and in particular to the functioning of the internal market. It is a risk framework  based on operational aspects and losses, essentially economic in its nature.  On the other hand, the GDPR relates risk to the rights and freedoms of individuals. This  approach introduces the impact of a potential personal data breach to the data subjects as the  major aspect of the data protection risk assessment and should also be seen in relation to the  requirement for a formal data protection impact assessment (Article 35 GDPR). Risks are  described in the regulation’s recital 85 as “physical, material or non-material damage to natural  persons such as loss of control over their personal data or limitation of their rights,  discrimination, identity theft or fraud, financial loss, unauthorised reversal of pseudonymisation,  damage to reputation, loss of confidentiality of personal data protected by professional secrecy  or any other significant economic or social disadvantage to the natural person concerned”.  WP293 also states that these risks are linked not only to privacy but to the rights enshrined to  the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the EU4. These risks include the “rights of the data  subject” as provided in chapter II of the GDPR. These provisions directly affect information  systems that process personal data, since procedures to access, rectify, erase or in some cases  restrict operations in one’s personal data, become mandatory requirements. It is a risk  framework based on rights and freedoms, essentially legal in its nature.  The key question is whether there is a unified risk management framework to mitigate all risks  or not. The following section explores possible answers to this question.  2.3.2  Security objectives  A risk management process comprises four key phases5, namely risk assessment, risk  treatment, risk acceptance and risk communication. Since both the NISD and the GDPR follow  a risk based approach, the aforementioned process can be followed, but one should bear in  mind the particularities of each legislative act. Since risks are of different nature (the NISD  focuses on societal and economic activities while the GDPR focuses on individual rights)  measures appropriate to mitigate each risk might be different. For example, measures like  pseudonymisation are mostly appropriate to data protection while measures and policies related  to the (cyber) ecosystem and suppliers of OES are tailor made for that category of undertakings.  It should be however noted that not all phases of risk management might be applicable when  putting together the provisions of both legal instruments. For example, there may be cases  under the GDPR that risk acceptance might not be a viable option6.  In addition, the stakeholders involved in incident or data breach notifications are different. In  case of a NISD security breach computer security incident response teams (CSIRTs) and CAs  3 See (ARTICLE 29 DATA PROTECTION WORKING PARTY, 2018) and (ARTICLE 29 DATA PROTECTION WORKING  PARTY, 2017A)  4 The Charter of Fundamental Rights of the EU, available at http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal- content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:12012P/TXT  5 See detailed analysis in ENISA’s information packages for SMEs on risk assessment and risk management methods,  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/information-packages-for-small-and-medium-sized-enterprises-smes  6 In this vein, it is worth mentioning article 36.1 of the GDPR that, in order to limit any hasty risk acceptance by data  controllers, invokes the consultation of the supervisory authority whenever a data protection impact assessment indicates  that the processing would result in a residual high risk in the absence of additional measures taken by the controller to  mitigate the risk.  NISD and GDPR  require a proper  assessment of  security risks.  Since, there is no  “no one-size-fits-  all approach” for  the calculation of  the security risk,  the maximum  possible level of  harmonization and  consistency1  between security  risk assessment  methodologies  under the two  legal acts should  be pursued.  http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:12012P/TXT http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:12012P/TXT https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/information-packages-for-small-and-medium-sized-enterprises-smes  STOCK TAKING OF SECURITY REQUIREMENTS SET BY DIFFERENT LEGAL  FRAMEWORKS ON OES AND DSPS  NOVEMBER 2019  12  should be informed about incidents in order to be able to contribute to the overall  national and EU cybersecurity. On the other hand, according to the GDPR, in case of  personal data breaches, the controllers have to measure their impact and the level of  risk to the fundamental rights of the affected individuals. Following that assessment, the  supervisory authorities (SAs) and data subjects may be required to be informed in order  to be able to mitigate the negative effects of the breach. CSIRTS and NISD CAs can  communicate with OES, on their own initiatives, in their attempt to achieve a high level  of security of network and information systems within the EU, or as a necessary  precaution in case of a major incident.  It is up to Member States to define these cooperation procedures. This is not only  stated in the NISD but also in GDPR. More specifically, recitals 5 and 7 of the GDPR  emphasise on the importance of the free flow of personal data within the Union and the  need to create an environment of trust that will allow the digital economy to develop  across the internal market. The addition of resilience as a fourth element of security in  GDPR is a clear indication of the interconnection between the two legal texts.  According to the NISD, competent authorities as well as data protection authorities  should cooperate and exchange information on all relevant matters to tackle any  personal data breaches resulting from incidents.  Although there are  significant differences,  regarding the security  measures in scope.  NISD and GDPR share a  common information  security background.  The proper functioning  of the underlying  network and  information systems  and services is a  prerequisite for the  security of any data  processing operation.  STOCK TAKING OF SECURITY REQUIREMENTS SET BY DIFFERENT LEGAL  FRAMEWORKS ON OES AND DSPS  NOVEMBER 2019  13  2.3.1 Scope  The NISD applies only to two broad categories of undertakings.  1. DSPs that provide important resources for their users in today’s digital  economy. Three categories of DSPs are considered (online  marketplaces, online search engines and cloud computing services).  Micro- and small enterprises are exempted.  2. OESs, that provide services “essential to the maintenance of critical  societal and/or economic activities”.  Online market places and online search engines are mostly addressed to  individuals, so proper functioning of these undertakings is highly related  to the protection of personal data. Cloud computing services might be  addressed to individuals or offered to businesses, but it is also highly  likely that they are used for personal data processing operations as well.  In the case of OESs, it is more complicated to come to a generic conclusion whether personal  data processing is taking place due to a legal obligations, a legitimate interest, consent etc.  The  correlation of the critical operations of such an operator with personal data protection operations  might vary drastically, depending on the nature of operations of each sector, the associated  risks and the introduction of personal data processing techniques in their core operations. For  example, the health sector is highly linked to personal data, while core operations of drinking  water supply and distribution seem less dependent on personal data processing operations.  However, the gradual introduction of new digital solutions, like IoT and smart metering, highly  relying on individuals’ habits, and the broad notion of personal data could lead to a change in  the future, taking into account also the increased possibilities of indirect identification through  data inference even when data de-identification techniques have been implemented (see  (ENISA, 2015B)).  2.3.2 Security Incidents  Under the NISD ‘incident’ means any event having an actual adverse effect on the security of  network and information systems. Not all security incidents are within the scope of the NISD.  The NISD Cooperation Group has identified that for OESs (NIS Cooperation Group, 2018B),  incidents under scope are those affecting the availability, authenticity, integrity or confidentiality  of networks and information systems (used in the provision of the essential service). In the case  of DSPs the incident should have an impact on the availability, authenticity, integrity or  confidentiality of the digital service. Incidents reported to a CA are those having a “significant  impact” on the continuity of the essential service and those having a substantial impact on the  provision of a digital service.  Under the GDPR a 'personal data breach' is defined as a breach of security leading to the  accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure of, or access to,  personal data transmitted, stored or otherwise processed. In practice, incidents that fall under  the GDPR are security incidents affecting personal data and that may impact individuals’ rights  and freedoms, so data breaches are a subset of security incidents. Reportable data breaches  are those that are likely to result in a risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons (see  more details in (ARTICLE 29 DATA PROTECTION WORKING PARTY, 2018)).  NISD covers all processing  operations, including those with  personal data, but only as long  as they are critical for the  provision of the undertaking’s  services.  On the contrary, GDPR is limited  only to personal data  processing operations, but it is  applicable to every undertaking  involved in such a processing  operation, regardless of its size.  STOCK TAKING OF SECURITY REQUIREMENTS SET BY DIFFERENT LEGAL  FRAMEWORKS ON OES AND DSPS  NOVEMBER 2019  14  In the context of this report, a security incident can be defined as an event that has an impact  on the security of the network and information system or on the security of the digital service or  on the processing of personal data. Organisations that face an incident will need to assess  whether they are obliged to notify under each piece of legislation or not.  These procedures can be harmonised to the maximum possible extent for the NISD as well as  for the GDPR. For example, healthcare or cloud providers might increase data availability by  duplicating data (thus reducing the likelihood of negative impacts on individuals arising from  absence of a backup) or implementing multihoming on storage facilities (thus reducing the  likelihood of negative impact on operations arising from an infrastructural failure). This way they  could ensure continuity of the services offered and access to personal data, to meet the  requirements arising from both legal acts.  Despite their common elements, reporting procedures might also differentiate due to the impact  of reporting periods on them. However, incident reporting and communicating procedures  Figure 1: Security incidents under NISD and GDPR.  Figure 2: Incident handling for NISD and GDPR  Incident  Impact on Data  Protection  Impact on  Services  Incident  Handling  GDPR reporting  NISD reporting  Organisations  should also have in  place procedures  for the response,  mitigation, recovery  and remediation  from such an  incident.  STOCK TAKING OF SECURITY REQUIREMENTS SET BY DIFFERENT LEGAL  FRAMEWORKS ON OES AND DSPS  NOVEMBER 2019  15  (Articles 33 and 34 of the GDPR or articles 14(3) and 16(3) of the NISD) are outside the scope  of this report and organisations should consult the already available guidance on the subject7.  2.3.3 The use of an Information Security Management System  NISD provisions do not directly provide for the establishment of an information management  system. However, since an obligation to have regard to the “state of the art” is explicitly stated, it  is evident that the use of an information security management system is encouraged. That is  also suggested by (NIS Cooperation Group, 2018A) and the Commission’s Implementing  Regulation (EU) 2018/151.  GDPR provisions on information security go beyond the mere adoption of specific security  measures by supporting the establishment of a thorough information management system for  the protection of confidentiality, integrity, availability and resilience of personal data. Article 32 of  the GDPR explicitly provides for a process for testing, assessing and evaluating the  effectiveness of the adopted information security measures, which indirectly calls for such an  information security management system.  It is worthwhile noticing that security measures in the GDPR are also envisaged as means to  demonstrate compliance with all principles of the Regulation8, i.e. for the lawfulness of  processing. For the purpose of this report, analysis is limited only to measures specifically  linked to the security of information systems and to Article 32 of the GDPR without making a  broad legal analysis of all the principles relating to processing of personal data.  2.4 Summary  Following the analysis in the previous sections, Table 1 below provides a comparative summary  of the NISD and GDPR security provisions.

In 2018, the NIS Cooperation Group issued  a reference document on security measures for OES and Commission issued an Implementing  Act on the elements to be taken into account by digital service providers for managing the risks  posed to the security of network and information systems. Having noted that, the following is the  list of documents which is the basis for the subsequent analysis.  1.

ENISA, ‘Guidelines for SMEs on the security of personal data processing’, (ENISA  2016B)  A brief presentation of these documents takes place in the next sections.  2.6 Guidelines relevant to NISD security measures  Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2018/151 specifies five (5) security elements to be  taken into account by DSPs to achieve a high common level of security of network and  information systems. This Regulation states high level objectives that DSPs must mandatorily  use when identifying the appropriate technical and organizational measures, using a risk based  approach.  In (ENISA, 2016A) common baseline security objectives for DSPs are defined. This study lists  27 security objectives (SOs) for DSPs. In those 27 SOs, security measures are included and are  set against well-known industry standards, national frameworks and certification schemes.  The NIS Cooperation Group issued a reference document on security measures for OES (NIS  Cooperation Group, 2018A). In this report the group, taking into account the views of all MSs,  including the specific implementation of security measure provisions in their national legislation,  agreed on seven principles and suggested a list of security measures’ domains. Within each  domain the group abstractly described security requirements.  2.7 Guideline relevant to GDPR security measures  In (ENISA, 2016B) the Agency provides guidance tailored for SMEs, following a risk-based  methodology. Since SMEs do not always have the necessary expertise and resources to  perform a proper risk assessment, this study aims to facilitate them in understanding the context  of personal data processing operations and subsequently assess the associated security risks.  Organizational and technical security measures for the protection of personal data, which are  appropriate to the risk presented, are proposed. These measures can be adopted by SMEs in  order to achieve compliance with the GDPR’s “no one-size-fits-all approach”. SMEs have to  identify the level of risk, depending on nature, scope, context of processing along to the types  and volumes of data processed. Then, security measures are proposed, in order to mitigate the  identified threats.  2.8 How enterprises can consult the available guidance?  As mentioned earlier, the starting point for OESs and DPSs should be the guidance produced  by ENISA and the NISD CG. More specifically (ENISA, 2016A) interpreted in the light of the  Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2018/151, should be the starting point for DSPs,  while (NIS Cooperation Group, 2018A) should be the starting point in the case of OES. Taking  the security objectives described in those reports as the baseline, the requirements of GDPR as  presented in (ENISA, 2016B) can be analysed against them, in order to identify the areas where  NISD security measures should be enhanced, for an operator/provider to be also compliant with  data protection provisions. Although the above guidance has been produced having OESs and  DSPs in mind, the proposed approach can also be used for every organisation that plans to  implement security measures covering also the protection of personal data.  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/minimum-security-measures-for-digital-service-providers http://ec.europa.eu/newsroom/dae/document.cfm?doc_id=53643 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/guidelines-for-smes-on-the-security-of-personal-data-processing https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/guidelines-for-smes-on-the-security-of-personal-data-processing  STOCK TAKING OF SECURITY REQUIREMENTS SET BY DIFFERENT LEGAL  FRAMEWORKS ON OES AND DSPS  NOVEMBER 2019  17  Do notice, that this approach can be used only for determining the proper security measures for  the processing operations that involve personal data and does not cover all stages of the proper  design and implementation of a data processing operation, including a data protection impact  assessment.  STOCK TAKING OF SECURITY REQUIREMENTS SET BY DIFFERENT LEGAL  FRAMEWORKS ON OES AND DSPS  NOVEMBER 2019  18  3. SECURITY REQUIREMENTS  3.1 Mapping of security measures stemming from Commission’s  Implementing Regulation (EU) 2018/151  3.1.1 How to use the tables  Categories of security measures present in the guidance documents (ENISA, 2016A) and  (ENISA, 2016B) cover, similar or even the same security objectives. For more guidance and  possible levels of sophisticated implementation of the security measures, the DSP should  consult the detailed guidance documents. One should also seek specialised guidance on topics  of particular importance to data protection in the documents published by the EDPB, WP29 and  the Commission both in the context of the GDPR e.g. guidance on data breaches, data  portability and in the context of specific data processing operations e.g. cloud providers,  transfers to third countries, processing data of employees or the use of CCTV systems.  3.1.2 Security requirements for DSPs tables  Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2018/151 dictates five (5) security mandatory  elements for DSPs. The related guidance, namely (ENISA, 2016A), identified 27 Security  Objectives (SOs), with the aim to cover all categories of security measures relevant to a DSP’s  resilience.  In the following table the SOs are grouped by the elements specified in the Implementing  Regulation. To facilitate the reader, in the second column we provide the title of the SO,  followed by the specific provision on the Implementing Regulation that it aims to cover (enclosed  in parenthesis). The last part of the second column, enclosed in square brackets, lists the SOs  number, following the numbering of (ENISA, 2016A). For the same purpose, the third column  provides the short description of that particular SO, as presented in that paper.  The next step is to map this set of measures with those presented in (ENISA, 2016B) which are  related to data protection. Each SO is analysed and enhancements are proposed to encounter  the differences in the security objectives arising from the (ENISA, 2016B). A brief justification of  the proposal is given followed by a reference (in parenthesis) to the specific security category or  categories, as presented in (ENISA, 2016B), that correspond to this security measure.  To summarise the use of this table, the DSP should:  1. Start from (ENISA, 2016A) and then assess whether existing security measures can  successfully mitigate the risks on the networks and information systems by using the  second column of the table.  2. Understand the additional elements required for this specific measure in order to  mitigate the risks on personal data by reading the last column of the table.  3. Get deeper guidance on how this enhancement might be implemented from (ENISA,  2016B).  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/minimum-security-measures-for-digital-service-providers https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/guidelines-for-smes-on-the-security-of-personal-data-processing https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/guidelines-for-smes-on-the-security-of-personal-data-processing  STOCK TAKING OF SECURITY REQUIREMENTS SET BY DIFFERENT LEGAL FRAMEWORKS ON OES AND DSPS  NOVEMBER 2019  19  3.1.1.1 Security of Systems and facilities  S/N Security Objective Description (ENISA, 2016A)  Data protection requirements  (ENISA, 2016B)  1.

The same SO is applicable to systems supporting personal data  processing with the goal to restore availability and access to personal  data in a timely manner. Plans should also cover services critical for  responding to data subjects rights requests (4.1.2.2)  2.  Disaster recovery capabilities  (art 2.3.b) [SO 18]  The DSP establishes and maintains an appropriate  disaster recovery capability for restoring the in case of  natural and/or major disasters.  As above, the same SO is applicable to systems supporting personal  data processing with the goal to restore availability and access to  personal data in a timely manner (4.1.2.2, 4.2.5)  17 See the relevant guidelines in (ARTICLE 29 DATA PROTECTION WORKING PARTY, 2018)  STOCK TAKING OF SECURITY REQUIREMENTS SET BY DIFFERENT LEGAL FRAMEWORKS ON OES AND DSPS  NOVEMBER 2019  24  3.1.1.4 Monitoring, Auditing and Testing  S/N Security Objective Description (ENISA, 2016A)  Data protection requirements  (ENISA, 2016B)  1.  Monitoring and logging  (art 2.4.a) [SO 19]  The DSP establishes and maintains procedures and  systems for monitoring and logging of the offered services  and user actions (logs of user actions, system  transactions/performance monitors, automated monitoring  tools etc.).  The same SO is applicable to systems supporting personal data  processing. Note that processing of personal data for monitoring and  logging should be in line with GDPR (4.2.2)  2.  System tests  (art 2.4.b) [SO 20]  The DSP establishes and maintains appropriate procedures  for testing key network and information systems  underpinning the offered services.  The same SO is applicable to systems supporting personal data  processing. When possible, testing procedures should respect the  principle of data minimization, e.g. by using dummy data.  3.  Security assessments  (art 2.4.c) [SO 21]  The DSP establishes and maintains appropriate procedures  for performing security assessments of critical assets.  The same control is applicable to systems supporting personal data  processing  4.  Customer Monitoring and log  access  (art 2.4.c) [SO 27]  The cloud provider grants customers access to relevant  transaction and performance logs so customers can  investigate issues or security incidents when needed.  The same SO is applicable to systems supporting personal data  processing. Notice also that relation between a cloud provider acting  as data processor on the basis of instructions given by its customers  (data controllers), should be governed by a written contract,  according to the GDPR art. 28.  3.1.1.5 Compliance with (Inter) national Standards  S/N Security Objective Description (ENISA, 2016A)  Data protection requirements  (ENISA, 2016B)  1.  Compliance  (art 2.5) [SO 22]  The DSP establishes and maintains a policy for checking  and enforcing the compliance of internal policies against  the national and EU legal requirements and industry best  practices and standards. These policies are reviewed on a  regular basis.  The same SO is applicable to systems supporting personal data  processing. Compliance with GDPR obligations should be a core  element to this end.  2.  Interoperability and portability  (art 2.5) [SO 26]  Online market place and cloud providers use standards  which allow customers to interface with other digital  services and/or if needed to migrate to other providers  offering similar services.  The GDPR provides also for the right to portability18. For detailed  guidance see the relevant text endorsed by the EDPB19.  18 This is also linked to the \"Right to data portability\" established for individuals by GDPR article 20. Do notice that this right does not create a direct and absolute obligation to data controllers to transfer data to another  controller, but only when it is technically feasible.  19 See (ARTICLE 29 DATA PROTECTION WORKING PARTY, 2016)  STOCK TAKING OF SECURITY REQUIREMENTS SET BY DIFFERENT LEGAL  FRAMEWORKS ON OES AND DSPS  NOVEMBER 2019  25  3.2 Mapping of security measures stemming from Cooperation Group’s  guidance  3.2.1 How to use the tables  Typically, OESs belong to the class of large companies and are vital for the modern society and  the economy. Their operation is heavily dependent on ICT. However, they do not always rely on  personal data processing. Specialized security standards have been in place for many years for  each of these sectors20, while some of the sectors are also regulated from sectoral national  authorities. In addition, the level of dependence of each sector on ICT and the level of  correlation of each section with personal data processing varies drastically. However, since both  NISD and GDPR share a common information security background, categories of security  measures, as presented in the table above, cover similar or even the same security objectives.  We can distinguish in the following:   Domains that need to take into account data protection risks. These mostly include  domains related to Information System Security Governance, Risk Management,  Ecosystem Management and Incident Management.   Domains where the envisaged security objectives tend to be identical. Examples of  these domains are asset management, IT security and administration domains, identity  and access management and procedures related to IT maintenance, physical and  environmental security and continuity of operations.   Domains that are significantly critical for core OES activities. These domains include all  measures related to industrial control systems, where limited data processing  operations are expected, the level of logging analysis, which is dependent on the  expected high risk, communication with CSIRSTs and crisis management.   Domains that although, not included in the guidelines of the NIS Cooperation Group,  should also be considered, in case of processing of personal data (marked with ‘+’ in  the table). In the table above, two such security objectives are added. The first relates  to how an OES should develop (and not only maintain, that was already tackled)  applications related to personal data, while the second is related to GDPR’s principle of  storage limitation.  Our goal is to provide a table that can be used as a reference. OESs should assess whether  their existing security measures can successfully mitigate their risks, including those on data  protection, using the table to identify the security measures that should be enhanced. In doing  so, they need to analyse their operations and identify personal data processing activities that  are critical for the provision of their services. Clearly, there is no “one-size-fits-all” solution, even  within the same sector or subsector. For detailed guidance, operators should rely on appropriate  sector specific security standards21 and consult the available guidance documents.  3.2.2 Security requirements for OES  A similar approach for the security measures for OESs is proposed which uses the (NIS  Cooperation Group, 2018A) as a starting point for this exercise. In this reference document,  thirty (30) domains of security measures, divided into 4 parts, are identified. These domains are  listed in the second column of the table and cover the broad spectrum of security measures  relevant to an OES. The reader should consult the original document for the full description of  the security measures. Similarly to the previous section, this set of measures is mapped with  those presented in (ENISA, 2016B) which are related to data protection. Each measure is  analysed and additional measures are proposed for personal data security. In the third column,  a short description of the proposed enhancements accompanied by a reference –in parenthesis-  to the relevant  security measure, arising from (ENISA, 2016B), is provided.  20 See (ENISA, 2017B) for a thorough presentation  21 See (ENISA, 2017B)  http://ec.europa.eu/newsroom/dae/document.cfm?doc_id=53643 http://ec.europa.eu/newsroom/dae/document.cfm?doc_id=53643 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/guidelines-for-smes-on-the-security-of-personal-data-processing  STOCK TAKING OF SECURITY REQUIREMENTS SET BY DIFFERENT LEGAL  FRAMEWORKS ON OES AND DSPS  NOVEMBER 2019  26  To summarise the use of these tables, the OES should:  1. Start from (NIS Cooperation Group, 2018A) and assess whether existing security  measures can successfully mitigate the risks on the networks and information systems  by using the second column of the table.  2. Understand the additional elements required for personal data security by reading the  last column of the table.  3.

If a Data Protection Impact  Assessment was carried out22, mandatorily or voluntarily, the outcome of this assessment can produce mandatory security  measures to address the data protection risks. (2.3.2, 3)  2  Information System Security  Policy  Information System Security Policy should also explicitly address the basic principles for the protection of personal data. (4.1.1.1)  3  Information System Security  Accreditation  Data protection risks should be part of the accreditation process and data protection residual risks should be managed and  documented. Attention should be paid to the possible need for DPIAs or consultation with the GDPR supervisory authority.  4  Information System Security  Indicators  Indicators related to data protection risks should also be considered.  5  Information System Security  Audit  Information system security assessments and audit procedures should consider data protection risks.  6 Human Resource Security  Personnel with access to personal data should have clearly defined and documented responsibilities. Relevant roles shall be based  on a need to know and reviewed on a regular basis. Knowledge and training should be ensured for Confidentiality and Data  Protection, according to personnel’s roles. Personnel involved in the processing of personal data is properly informed about its duty  to confidentiality and its data protection obligations. Training should be appropriate to personnel’s roles, especially for key personnel  involved in high risk processing. The role of the DPO includes, awareness-raising and training of staff involved in processing  operations.

IT resources should include the means of personal data processing. Formal internal accreditation  procedure of most critical resources could be implemented. (4.1.1.4)  1.2 ECOSYSTEM MANAGEMENT  1 Ecosystem Mapping  Ecosystem mapping should take into consideration the processing of personal data (e.g. processors, transfers to third parties).  Relations concerning recipients of personal data shall be documented23. (4.1.1.6)  2 Ecosystem Relations  Third party relations should, necessarily, be governed by contract or other legal act. Contracts should include specific clauses24  referring to the security of personal data and the management of personal data breaches. Further attention is required when  personal data are transferred to third parties (data processors) in third countries (outside the E.E.A.) when chapter V of the GDPR  applies25.

CONCLUSIONS -  RECOMMENDATIONS  NISD and GDPR have both reinforced the provisions on information security, but from a  different perspective. NISD aims to achieve a high level of resilience and security of network  and information systems for entities that are essential for the functioning of the European  economy, for the protection of critical services (e.g. health) as well as for the well-being of the  citizen. GDPR aims to strengthen the protection of personal data, reinforcing the provisions on  information security. Both legislative acts share a common information security background.  Operators of Essential Services and Digital Service Providers face the burden of compliance  with two sets of provisions with potential overlaps and unnecessary administrative burden.  This report aims to analyse the differences and similarities, based on ENISA technical  documents, identify the overlaps and provide guidance to OESs, DSPs as well as to  organisations that offer services to them, on how to implement technical and organisational  measures that are appropriate for both set of provisions. Compliance cannot be merely formal  or based on the implementation of closed checklists, but linked to the “context” where an  operation takes place and the actual risks. Undertakings should follow methodologies that fit to  their business sector to implement or assess their security measures, based on the pre-existing  guidance. The proposed list of security objectives is aimed to provide a good starting point for  this assessment.  While performing the analysis of selected measures categories, a number of conclusions and  relevant recommendations were drawn and are discussed below.  A common risk management framework  Since both the NISD and the GDPR follow a risk based approach, managing risks can be  achieved through one process by, taking into account security and data protection risks and  their essential differences, especially on the way the risks are mitigated. Undertakings can  benefit from a common risk management framework that uses common controls thus making it  efficient and cost-effective, while at the same time making it easy to support risk management  decisions. Notice that although there are security and privacy risk management frameworks32,  such an approach must be suitable for the EU legal framework and the notion of data protection  as envisaged with the GDPR. Such a harmonised approach could also be beneficial to other  legal frameworks that follow a risk based approach and can facilitate the establishment of the  Digital Single Market.  Specialized guidance on each sector  From the analysis presented, it is obvious that the level of risk depends on the exact information  (including personal data) processing activities and network dependencies of each entity.  However, a contextual analysis of risks cannot be performed uniformly for every industry sector  (or even subsector) that fall within the scope of the NISD. To further advance the level of  security of network and information systems and data protection one needs to explore these  activities and provide specialised guidance. A thorough analysis is required for each subsector,  32 E.g. NIST SP 800-37 Rev. 2, Risk Management Framework for Information Systems and Organizations: A System Life  Cycle Approach for Security and Privacy - https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800-37/rev-2/final  STOCK TAKING OF SECURITY REQUIREMENTS SET BY DIFFERENT LEGAL  FRAMEWORKS ON OES AND DSPS  NOVEMBER 2019  33  through cooperation of experts familiar with the particular subsector, security of network and  information systems and data protection.  Specialised guidance on emerging data protection and security techniques  Competent EU bodies and research bodies should continue to provide specialised guidance on  “state-of-the-art” data protection and security techniques. That will facilitate the adoption and  deployment of these techniques throughout EU.  Synergies between NISD and GDPR authorities  NISD competent authorities (and CSIRTs) and Data Protection Authorities should also establish  a method of cooperation, especially when dealing with security incidents. NISD provides for  such a cooperation, but it is left up to national legislation. In order to achieve a consistent level  of cooperation between these authorities, member states and authorities could benefit from a  list of recommendations on how to establish synergies and put into practise collaborative and  cooperative mechanisms.  Certifications  The new regulation on ENISA (''Cybersecurity Act'') provides for a role of the agency on  cybersecurity certification schemes. On the other hand, the GDPR provides for the  establishment of certification mechanisms for its own purposes. A channel of co-operation  between these two schemes could be explored in the future for the benefit of all involved parties  in the area of information security.

The  General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR ) has reinforced the pre-existing provisions of  Directive 95/46/EC on security of personal data for data controllers and processors. The  Network and Information Systems Directive (NISD ) introduced obligations for operators of  essential services (OES) and for digital service providers (DSP), in an effort to achieve a  baseline, common level of information security within the European Union (EU) network and  information systems.  Over the previous years, ENISA has published several guidance documents for security  measures both in the context of the NISD, addressed to OESs and DSPs, and in the context of  the GDPR, addressed to controllers and processors. Based on these publications, this report  aims at providing a harmonized approach in using the available ENISA guidance, one that can  also be used by every organisation that plans to implement security measures appropriate for  the security of network and information systems as well as for personal data protection.  Although both NISD and GDPR follow a risk-based approach, the entities under the scope of  these provisions should take into account the differences arising from: a) the scope of each  legal instrument, b) the notion of risk within each legal instrument (e.g. risk for the organization  and the risk for the individual), b) the purpose of deploying security measures, d) the (security)  incidents under consideration and e) additional requirements, further to the risk assessment,  imposed (e.g. Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) which might be required under GDPR  and pertains risk assessment),. The report establishes that, in practice, there is no conflict  between these acts.  In order to support organisations in their process of identifying appropriate security measures,  based on the provisions of both NISD and GDPR, this report uses as basis the pre-existing  ENISA guidance and presents a mapping of already identified security objectives, between the  NISD and the GDPR.  The report should be used as a starting point for the above-mentioned assessment and is  targeted mainly to OESs and DSPs. Following the analysis in Sections 2, 3 and 4, this report  concludes that organisations could benefit from a unified risk management framework,  specialized sectorial guidance and specialised guidance on emerging privacy and security  techniques. It also proposes that a method of cooperation between competent NISD and GDPR  authorities as well as a co-ordinated approach on certifications concerning information security  issues would be beneficial for the Digital Single Market.  Finally the report concludes a set of key recommendations which summarise as follows:   NIS Competent Bodies and Data Protection Authorities should promote a common risk  management framework risk because both NISD and GDPR follow a risk-based  approach and managing risk can be achieved through one process.   NIS Competent Bodies and Data Protection competent Authorities should follow a  sector specific approach whenever this is required which takes into account the  specific needs for information security as well as for data protection of the sector.   Research Community and ENISA should continue to provide specialised guidance on  emerging data protection and security techniques.  This report aims  at providing a  harmonized  approach in  using the  available ENISA  guidance on how  to implement  security  measures for  network and  information  systems as well  as for personal  data protection.  STOCK TAKING OF SECURITY REQUIREMENTS SET BY DIFFERENT LEGAL  FRAMEWORKS ON OES AND DSPS  NOVEMBER 2019  6   NIS Competent Bodies as well as Data Protection Authorities, under the active  leadership of European Commission should establish a method of collaboration in  order to achieve consistency   NIS Competent Bodies as well as Data Protection Authorities in collaboration with  ENISA and European Commission should promote the collaboration of the NISD and  GDPR in the area of certification.  STOCK TAKING OF SECURITY REQUIREMENTS SET BY DIFFERENT LEGAL  FRAMEWORKS ON OES AND DSPS  NOVEMBER 2019  7  1. INTRODUCTION  1.1 BACKGROUND  In May 2018, both the GDPR and the NISD came into force. The GDPR introduces reinforced  information security requirements compared to Directive 95/46, for all organizations involved in  personal data processing operations affecting EU residents. The NISD includes provisions on  security requirements for OESs, designated per member state (MS) and DSPs, excluding micro  and small enterprises.  Both EU legislations contain security requirements and require organizations to mitigate security  breaches; however the focus of the NISD and the GDPR is different. The GDPR focuses on  security breaches of personal data with an impact on individuals’ rights and freedoms, while the  NISD focuses on network and information security breaches with an impact on the services of  OESs and DSPs.  The material scope of the NISD and the GDPR is also different. The GDPR applies to all  organizations processing personal data while the NISD applies only to a subset of (large)  companies. However, there are many organisations, which need to take into account both  security requirements; for example, organisations which are not in scope of the NISD, but are  delivering products and services to organisations in scope of this directive, say a small  enterprise in the supply chain of an OES.  Since both legal acts share a common information security background, many of the security  measures for OESs or DSPs under the NISD are also applicable for organizations under the  GDPR. For instance, both legal instruments necessitate in practice the use of an information  security management system and both follow a risk-based approach, even with a different  orientation with regards to the impact, as under NISD the level of risk is calculated taking into  account the impact on the organization while under GDPR the level of risk is calculated taking  into account the impact on the individual.  1.2 SCOPE AND OBJECTIVE  The target audience of this publication is the information security personnel of OESs and DSPs.  The objectives of this report are to:   demonstrate and analyse the different approaches of these two legislative documents  as per the security requirements of network and information systems; and   present a mapping of security objectives, between the NISD and the GDPR, based on  existing ENISA publications.  It should be noted that this report focuses solely on network and information security  requirements and should not be confused with requirements stemming from the data protection  by design and by default obligation of the GDPR Article 25 or from a data protection impact  assessment (DPIA - Article 35 GDPR) i.e. measures that are designed to implement, in an  effective manner, data-protection principles, such as data minimisation. Indeed, while, a risk  based approach, and deployment of relevant security measures, is part of the DPIA, additional  aspects that go beyond information security must be taken into account while conducting a  DPIA.  STOCK TAKING OF SECURITY REQUIREMENTS SET BY DIFFERENT LEGAL  FRAMEWORKS ON OES AND DSPS  NOVEMBER 2019  8  1.3 STRUCTURE  In section 2 an analysis of the legal framework for the NISD and the GDPR is presented,  focused on the requirements for the security of network and information systems. Overlaps and  gaps are identified and the main differences are pointed out. Section 3 provides a list of the  main guidance documents that have been produced by ENISA and the NISD Cooperation  Group, categorized by legal act.  Section 4 uses the aforementioned ENISA guidance to cover security requirements under both  NISD and GDPR Finally, in section 5 we provide a list of conclusions and recommendations for  future activities.  STOCK TAKING OF SECURITY REQUIREMENTS SET BY DIFFERENT LEGAL  FRAMEWORKS ON OES AND DSPS  NOVEMBER 2019  9  2. GAP ANALYSIS OF  SECURITY RELATED  PROVISIONS  2.1 THE EU LEGAL FRAMEWORK FOR THE SECURITY OF NETWORK  AND INFORMATION SYSTEMS  Article 14 of NISD requires that member states (MSs) ensure that “…operators of essential  services take appropriate and proportionate technical and organisational measures to manage  the risks posed to the security of network and information systems which they use in their  operations. Having regard to the state of the art, those measures shall ensure a level of security  of network and information systems appropriate to the risk posed.” Furthermore, art. 15 para 2  (b) requires that OES need to have in place an “effective implementation of security policies”.  In a similar way, Article 16 of NISD requires that MS ensure that “…digital service providers  identify and take appropriate and proportionate technical and organisational measures to  manage the risks posed to the security of network and information systems which they use in  the context of offering services referred to in Annex III within the Union. Having regard to the  state of the art, those measures shall ensure a level of security of network and information  systems appropriate to the risk posed, and shall take into account the following elements (a) the  security of systems and facilities; (b) incident handling; (c) business continuity management; (d)  monitoring, auditing and testing; (e) compliance with international standards.”  The Commission issued implementing Regulation (EU) 2018/1511to further specify the  elements that DSPs should take into account in order to manage the existing security risks of  their networks and information systems, as well as the parameters for determining whether an  incident has a significant impact or not.  For OES as well as for DSPs, the Directive aims to ensure the continuity of those services and  to build a culture of network and information systems security across sectors vital for our society  and economy and heavily dependent on ICT. NISD is applicable to industry sectors of Annex II  while DSP services are stated in Annex III. The security measures are applicable only to the  OES which will be designated as such by the MS. For this task, the Competent Authority (CA)  should follow a consistent approach that is based on national criteria for the determination of  what constitutes a significant disruptive effect. It is also evident that security requirements for  digital service providers are lighter. In addition, micro and small enterprises are exempted from  the NISD.  2.2 THE EU LEGAL FRAMEWORK FOR THE PROTECTION OF  PERSONAL DATA  Security of personal data was already established as a legal obligation for data controllers  under the Data Protection Directive 95/46/EC. GDPR reinforces the relevant provisions while  extending this responsibility directly to data processors.  Security of personal data (but with a particular focus on integrity and confidentiality) is elevated  in one of the principles relating to personal data processing (GDPR Article 5.1(f)). This puts  security at the core of data protection together with the rest of data protection principles, i.e.  1 http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg_impl/2018/151/oj  http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg_impl/2018/151/oj  STOCK TAKING OF SECURITY REQUIREMENTS SET BY DIFFERENT LEGAL  FRAMEWORKS ON OES AND DSPS  NOVEMBER 2019  10  lawfulness, fairness and transparency, purpose limitation, accuracy and storage limitation. The  addition of the accountability principle is also closely related to new obligations on security, as  undertakings need not only apply security measures, but also mandatorily document them, i.e.  through policies.  Section 2 of GDPR’s chapter IV, spanning 3 specific articles, establishes obligations for data  controllers and processors for the security of personal data processing including incident  handling. GDPR Article 32 provides that “Taking into account the state of the art, the costs of  implementation and the nature, scope, context and purposes of processing as well as the risk of  varying likelihood and severity for the rights and freedoms of natural persons, the controller and  the processor shall implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure a  level of security appropriate to the risk, including inter alia as appropriate: (a) the  pseudonymisation and encryption of personal data; (b) the ability to ensure the ongoing  confidentiality, integrity, availability and resilience of processing systems and services; (c) the  ability to restore the availability and access to personal data in a timely manner in the event of a  physical or technical incident; (d) a process for regularly testing, assessing and evaluating the  effectiveness of technical and organisational measures for ensuring the security of the  processing.”  In the subsequent paragraph the article further defines the above introduced risk based  approach, providing, in essence, risk factors: “in assessing the appropriate level of security  account shall be taken in particular of the risks that are presented by data processing, in  particular from accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorised disclosure of, or  access to personal data transmitted, stored or otherwise processed”. It also mentions the use of  codes of conduct or certification mechanisms (as regulated in Article 41 GDPR) to demonstrate  compliance with the requirements for the security of processing. Last, it states that the controller  in primis and consequently the processor are responsible for their personnel as they are  required to take steps to ensure that any natural person acting under their authority and who  has access to personal data does not process them except on instructions from the controller,  unless he or she is required to do so by Union or Member State law2.  It is worthwhile mentioning that the GDPR not only uses the classic CIA triad (confidentiality,  integrity, availability) but also introduces “resilience” as the fourth constituent part of security.  This recognises that reliability (e.g. fault tolerance, absence of single points of failure) of  information systems processing personal data are important for the development of the digital  economy and for the provision of services to EU residents. A perfect example for that argument  is the importance of DSPs, as mentioned in NISD. For their proper functioning, these systems  need also to withstand and recover from disruptions.  2.3 THE SECURITY PROVISIONS IN NISD AND GDPR  From the previous analysis it is evident that both legal texts follow a risk-based approach. This  is not surprising. OESs and DSPs activities under the scope of the NISD and most personal  data processing operations are carried out through information systems and networks. The  principles of information security risk management are applied in both cases in order to identify,  quantify and manage the security risks that an organisation faces. To be able to identify  differences and similarities, we need to look at the purpose and scope of each legal act and  check the following four factors:  1. Risks stemming from each legal act  2. The purpose of security measures  3. The scope of each legal act  2 For an introduction to information security and risk management, examining the specificities for personal data processing see (ENISA, 2016B)  STOCK TAKING OF SECURITY REQUIREMENTS SET BY DIFFERENT LEGAL  FRAMEWORKS ON OES AND DSPS  NOVEMBER 2019  11  4. Security incidents under consideration  2.3.1  A risk-based approach  The NISD explicitly defines risk as “any reasonably identifiable circumstance or event having a  potential adverse effect on the security of network and information systems” (Article 4.9 NISD).  Incidents can impede the pursuit of economic activities, generate substantial financial losses,  undermine user confidence and cause major damage to the smooth functioning of the economy  within the Union. From the above, it is evident that the directive recognises that reliability and  security of network and information systems and services are essential to economic and  societal activities, and in particular to the functioning of the internal market. It is a risk framework  based on operational aspects and losses, essentially economic in its nature.  On the other hand, the GDPR relates risk to the rights and freedoms of individuals. This  approach introduces the impact of a potential personal data breach to the data subjects as the  major aspect of the data protection risk assessment and should also be seen in relation to the  requirement for a formal data protection impact assessment (Article 35 GDPR). Risks are  described in the regulation’s recital 85 as “physical, material or non-material damage to natural  persons such as loss of control over their personal data or limitation of their rights,  discrimination, identity theft or fraud, financial loss, unauthorised reversal of pseudonymisation,  damage to reputation, loss of confidentiality of personal data protected by professional secrecy  or any other significant economic or social disadvantage to the natural person concerned”.  WP293 also states that these risks are linked not only to privacy but to the rights enshrined to  the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the EU4. These risks include the “rights of the data  subject” as provided in chapter II of the GDPR. These provisions directly affect information  systems that process personal data, since procedures to access, rectify, erase or in some cases  restrict operations in one’s personal data, become mandatory requirements. It is a risk  framework based on rights and freedoms, essentially legal in its nature.  The key question is whether there is a unified risk management framework to mitigate all risks  or not. The following section explores possible answers to this question.  2.3.2  Security objectives  A risk management process comprises four key phases5, namely risk assessment, risk  treatment, risk acceptance and risk communication. Since both the NISD and the GDPR follow  a risk based approach, the aforementioned process can be followed, but one should bear in  mind the particularities of each legislative act. Since risks are of different nature (the NISD  focuses on societal and economic activities while the GDPR focuses on individual rights)  measures appropriate to mitigate each risk might be different. For example, measures like  pseudonymisation are mostly appropriate to data protection while measures and policies related  to the (cyber) ecosystem and suppliers of OES are tailor made for that category of undertakings.  It should be however noted that not all phases of risk management might be applicable when  putting together the provisions of both legal instruments. For example, there may be cases  under the GDPR that risk acceptance might not be a viable option6.  In addition, the stakeholders involved in incident or data breach notifications are different. In  case of a NISD security breach computer security incident response teams (CSIRTs) and CAs  3 See (ARTICLE 29 DATA PROTECTION WORKING PARTY, 2018) and (ARTICLE 29 DATA PROTECTION WORKING  PARTY, 2017A)  4 The Charter of Fundamental Rights of the EU, available at http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal- content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:12012P/TXT  5 See detailed analysis in ENISA’s information packages for SMEs on risk assessment and risk management methods,  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/information-packages-for-small-and-medium-sized-enterprises-smes  6 In this vein, it is worth mentioning article 36.1 of the GDPR that, in order to limit any hasty risk acceptance by data  controllers, invokes the consultation of the supervisory authority whenever a data protection impact assessment indicates  that the processing would result in a residual high risk in the absence of additional measures taken by the controller to  mitigate the risk.  NISD and GDPR  require a proper  assessment of  security risks.  Since, there is no  “no one-size-fits-  all approach” for  the calculation of  the security risk,  the maximum  possible level of  harmonization and  consistency1  between security  risk assessment  methodologies  under the two  legal acts should  be pursued.  http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:12012P/TXT http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:12012P/TXT https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/information-packages-for-small-and-medium-sized-enterprises-smes  STOCK TAKING OF SECURITY REQUIREMENTS SET BY DIFFERENT LEGAL  FRAMEWORKS ON OES AND DSPS  NOVEMBER 2019  12  should be informed about incidents in order to be able to contribute to the overall  national and EU cybersecurity. On the other hand, according to the GDPR, in case of  personal data breaches, the controllers have to measure their impact and the level of  risk to the fundamental rights of the affected individuals. Following that assessment, the  supervisory authorities (SAs) and data subjects may be required to be informed in order  to be able to mitigate the negative effects of the breach. CSIRTS and NISD CAs can  communicate with OES, on their own initiatives, in their attempt to achieve a high level  of security of network and information systems within the EU, or as a necessary  precaution in case of a major incident.  It is up to Member States to define these cooperation procedures. This is not only  stated in the NISD but also in GDPR. More specifically, recitals 5 and 7 of the GDPR  emphasise on the importance of the free flow of personal data within the Union and the  need to create an environment of trust that will allow the digital economy to develop  across the internal market. The addition of resilience as a fourth element of security in  GDPR is a clear indication of the interconnection between the two legal texts.  According to the NISD, competent authorities as well as data protection authorities  should cooperate and exchange information on all relevant matters to tackle any  personal data breaches resulting from incidents.  Although there are  significant differences,  regarding the security  measures in scope.  NISD and GDPR share a  common information  security background.  The proper functioning  of the underlying  network and  information systems  and services is a  prerequisite for the  security of any data  processing operation.  STOCK TAKING OF SECURITY REQUIREMENTS SET BY DIFFERENT LEGAL  FRAMEWORKS ON OES AND DSPS  NOVEMBER 2019  13  2.3.1 Scope  The NISD applies only to two broad categories of undertakings.  1. DSPs that provide important resources for their users in today’s digital  economy. Three categories of DSPs are considered (online  marketplaces, online search engines and cloud computing services).  Micro- and small enterprises are exempted.  2. OESs, that provide services “essential to the maintenance of critical  societal and/or economic activities”.  Online market places and online search engines are mostly addressed to  individuals, so proper functioning of these undertakings is highly related  to the protection of personal data. Cloud computing services might be  addressed to individuals or offered to businesses, but it is also highly  likely that they are used for personal data processing operations as well.  In the case of OESs, it is more complicated to come to a generic conclusion whether personal  data processing is taking place due to a legal obligations, a legitimate interest, consent etc.  The  correlation of the critical operations of such an operator with personal data protection operations  might vary drastically, depending on the nature of operations of each sector, the associated  risks and the introduction of personal data processing techniques in their core operations. For  example, the health sector is highly linked to personal data, while core operations of drinking  water supply and distribution seem less dependent on personal data processing operations.  However, the gradual introduction of new digital solutions, like IoT and smart metering, highly  relying on individuals’ habits, and the broad notion of personal data could lead to a change in  the future, taking into account also the increased possibilities of indirect identification through  data inference even when data de-identification techniques have been implemented (see  (ENISA, 2015B)).  2.3.2 Security Incidents  Under the NISD ‘incident’ means any event having an actual adverse effect on the security of  network and information systems. Not all security incidents are within the scope of the NISD.  The NISD Cooperation Group has identified that for OESs (NIS Cooperation Group, 2018B),  incidents under scope are those affecting the availability, authenticity, integrity or confidentiality  of networks and information systems (used in the provision of the essential service). In the case  of DSPs the incident should have an impact on the availability, authenticity, integrity or  confidentiality of the digital service. Incidents reported to a CA are those having a “significant  impact” on the continuity of the essential service and those having a substantial impact on the  provision of a digital service.  Under the GDPR a 'personal data breach' is defined as a breach of security leading to the  accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure of, or access to,  personal data transmitted, stored or otherwise processed. In practice, incidents that fall under  the GDPR are security incidents affecting personal data and that may impact individuals’ rights  and freedoms, so data breaches are a subset of security incidents. Reportable data breaches  are those that are likely to result in a risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons (see  more details in (ARTICLE 29 DATA PROTECTION WORKING PARTY, 2018)).  NISD covers all processing  operations, including those with  personal data, but only as long  as they are critical for the  provision of the undertaking’s  services.  On the contrary, GDPR is limited  only to personal data  processing operations, but it is  applicable to every undertaking  involved in such a processing  operation, regardless of its size.  STOCK TAKING OF SECURITY REQUIREMENTS SET BY DIFFERENT LEGAL  FRAMEWORKS ON OES AND DSPS  NOVEMBER 2019  14  In the context of this report, a security incident can be defined as an event that has an impact  on the security of the network and information system or on the security of the digital service or  on the processing of personal data. Organisations that face an incident will need to assess  whether they are obliged to notify under each piece of legislation or not.  These procedures can be harmonised to the maximum possible extent for the NISD as well as  for the GDPR. For example, healthcare or cloud providers might increase data availability by  duplicating data (thus reducing the likelihood of negative impacts on individuals arising from  absence of a backup) or implementing multihoming on storage facilities (thus reducing the  likelihood of negative impact on operations arising from an infrastructural failure). This way they  could ensure continuity of the services offered and access to personal data, to meet the  requirements arising from both legal acts.  Despite their common elements, reporting procedures might also differentiate due to the impact  of reporting periods on them. However, incident reporting and communicating procedures  Figure 1: Security incidents under NISD and GDPR.  Figure 2: Incident handling for NISD and GDPR  Incident  Impact on Data  Protection  Impact on  Services  Incident  Handling  GDPR reporting  NISD reporting  Organisations  should also have in  place procedures  for the response,  mitigation, recovery  and remediation  from such an  incident.  STOCK TAKING OF SECURITY REQUIREMENTS SET BY DIFFERENT LEGAL  FRAMEWORKS ON OES AND DSPS  NOVEMBER 2019  15  (Articles 33 and 34 of the GDPR or articles 14(3) and 16(3) of the NISD) are outside the scope  of this report and organisations should consult the already available guidance on the subject7.  2.3.3 The use of an Information Security Management System  NISD provisions do not directly provide for the establishment of an information management  system. However, since an obligation to have regard to the “state of the art” is explicitly stated, it  is evident that the use of an information security management system is encouraged. That is  also suggested by (NIS Cooperation Group, 2018A) and the Commission’s Implementing  Regulation (EU) 2018/151.  GDPR provisions on information security go beyond the mere adoption of specific security  measures by supporting the establishment of a thorough information management system for  the protection of confidentiality, integrity, availability and resilience of personal data. Article 32 of  the GDPR explicitly provides for a process for testing, assessing and evaluating the  effectiveness of the adopted information security measures, which indirectly calls for such an  information security management system.  It is worthwhile noticing that security measures in the GDPR are also envisaged as means to  demonstrate compliance with all principles of the Regulation8, i.e. for the lawfulness of  processing. For the purpose of this report, analysis is limited only to measures specifically  linked to the security of information systems and to Article 32 of the GDPR without making a  broad legal analysis of all the principles relating to processing of personal data.  2.4 Summary  Following the analysis in the previous sections, Table 1 below provides a comparative summary  of the NISD and GDPR security provisions.

In 2018, the NIS Cooperation Group issued  a reference document on security measures for OES and Commission issued an Implementing  Act on the elements to be taken into account by digital service providers for managing the risks  posed to the security of network and information systems. Having noted that, the following is the  list of documents which is the basis for the subsequent analysis.  1. Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2018/151 laying down rules for application  of Directive (EU) 2016/1148 of the European Parliament and of the Council as regards  further specification of the elements to be taken into account by digital service  7 See (ARTICLE 29 DATA PROTECTION WORKING PARTY, 2018), (NIS Cooperation Group, 2018B) and (NIS  Cooperation Group, 2018C)  8 See Articles 24.1 and 35.7 of the GDPR  Both legal acts  require the use of  an information  security  management  system:  One explicitly for  security of critical  operations  The other for the  protection of  personal data  processing. That is  where both legal  acts meet.  https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=uriserv:OJ.L_.2018.026.01.0048.01.ENG  STOCK TAKING OF SECURITY REQUIREMENTS SET BY DIFFERENT LEGAL  FRAMEWORKS ON OES AND DSPS  NOVEMBER 2019  16  providers for managing the risks posed to the security of network and information  systems and of the parameters for determining whether an incident has a substantial  impact.  2. ENISA ‘Technical Guidelines for the implementation of minimum security measures for  Digital Service Providers’, (ENISA 2016A)  3. The NIS Cooperation Group Publication 01/2018 - Reference document on security  measures for Operators of Essential Services  4. ENISA, ‘Guidelines for SMEs on the security of personal data processing’, (ENISA  2016B)  A brief presentation of these documents takes place in the next sections.  2.6 Guidelines relevant to NISD security measures  Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2018/151 specifies five (5) security elements to be  taken into account by DSPs to achieve a high common level of security of network and  information systems. This Regulation states high level objectives that DSPs must mandatorily  use when identifying the appropriate technical and organizational measures, using a risk based  approach.  In (ENISA, 2016A) common baseline security objectives for DSPs are defined. This study lists  27 security objectives (SOs) for DSPs. In those 27 SOs, security measures are included and are  set against well-known industry standards, national frameworks and certification schemes.  The NIS Cooperation Group issued a reference document on security measures for OES (NIS  Cooperation Group, 2018A). In this report the group, taking into account the views of all MSs,  including the specific implementation of security measure provisions in their national legislation,  agreed on seven principles and suggested a list of security measures’ domains. Within each  domain the group abstractly described security requirements.  2.7 Guideline relevant to GDPR security measures  In (ENISA, 2016B) the Agency provides guidance tailored for SMEs, following a risk-based  methodology. Since SMEs do not always have the necessary expertise and resources to  perform a proper risk assessment, this study aims to facilitate them in understanding the context  of personal data processing operations and subsequently assess the associated security risks.  Organizational and technical security measures for the protection of personal data, which are  appropriate to the risk presented, are proposed. These measures can be adopted by SMEs in  order to achieve compliance with the GDPR’s “no one-size-fits-all approach”. SMEs have to  identify the level of risk, depending on nature, scope, context of processing along to the types  and volumes of data processed. Then, security measures are proposed, in order to mitigate the  identified threats.  2.8 How enterprises can consult the available guidance?  As mentioned earlier, the starting point for OESs and DPSs should be the guidance produced  by ENISA and the NISD CG. More specifically (ENISA, 2016A) interpreted in the light of the  Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2018/151, should be the starting point for DSPs,  while (NIS Cooperation Group, 2018A) should be the starting point in the case of OES. Taking  the security objectives described in those reports as the baseline, the requirements of GDPR as  presented in (ENISA, 2016B) can be analysed against them, in order to identify the areas where  NISD security measures should be enhanced, for an operator/provider to be also compliant with  data protection provisions. Although the above guidance has been produced having OESs and  DSPs in mind, the proposed approach can also be used for every organisation that plans to  implement security measures covering also the protection of personal data.  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/minimum-security-measures-for-digital-service-providers http://ec.europa.eu/newsroom/dae/document.cfm?doc_id=53643 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/guidelines-for-smes-on-the-security-of-personal-data-processing https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/guidelines-for-smes-on-the-security-of-personal-data-processing  STOCK TAKING OF SECURITY REQUIREMENTS SET BY DIFFERENT LEGAL  FRAMEWORKS ON OES AND DSPS  NOVEMBER 2019  17  Do notice, that this approach can be used only for determining the proper security measures for  the processing operations that involve personal data and does not cover all stages of the proper  design and implementation of a data processing operation, including a data protection impact  assessment.

SECURITY REQUIREMENTS  3.1 Mapping of security measures stemming from Commission’s  Implementing Regulation (EU) 2018/151  3.1.1 How to use the tables  Categories of security measures present in the guidance documents (ENISA, 2016A) and  (ENISA, 2016B) cover, similar or even the same security objectives. For more guidance and  possible levels of sophisticated implementation of the security measures, the DSP should  consult the detailed guidance documents. One should also seek specialised guidance on topics  of particular importance to data protection in the documents published by the EDPB, WP29 and  the Commission both in the context of the GDPR e.g. guidance on data breaches, data  portability and in the context of specific data processing operations e.g. cloud providers,  transfers to third countries, processing data of employees or the use of CCTV systems.  3.1.2 Security requirements for DSPs tables  Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2018/151 dictates five (5) security mandatory  elements for DSPs. The related guidance, namely (ENISA, 2016A), identified 27 Security  Objectives (SOs), with the aim to cover all categories of security measures relevant to a DSP’s  resilience.  In the following table the SOs are grouped by the elements specified in the Implementing  Regulation. To facilitate the reader, in the second column we provide the title of the SO,  followed by the specific provision on the Implementing Regulation that it aims to cover (enclosed  in parenthesis). The last part of the second column, enclosed in square brackets, lists the SOs  number, following the numbering of (ENISA, 2016A). For the same purpose, the third column  provides the short description of that particular SO, as presented in that paper.  The next step is to map this set of measures with those presented in (ENISA, 2016B) which are  related to data protection. Each SO is analysed and enhancements are proposed to encounter  the differences in the security objectives arising from the (ENISA, 2016B). A brief justification of  the proposal is given followed by a reference (in parenthesis) to the specific security category or  categories, as presented in (ENISA, 2016B), that correspond to this security measure.  To summarise the use of this table, the DSP should:  1. Start from (ENISA, 2016A) and then assess whether existing security measures can  successfully mitigate the risks on the networks and information systems by using the  second column of the table.  2. Understand the additional elements required for this specific measure in order to  mitigate the risks on personal data by reading the last column of the table.  3. Get deeper guidance on how this enhancement might be implemented from (ENISA,  2016B).  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/minimum-security-measures-for-digital-service-providers https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/guidelines-for-smes-on-the-security-of-personal-data-processing https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/guidelines-for-smes-on-the-security-of-personal-data-processing  STOCK TAKING OF SECURITY REQUIREMENTS SET BY DIFFERENT LEGAL FRAMEWORKS ON OES AND DSPS  NOVEMBER 2019  19  3.1.1.1 Security of Systems and facilities  S/N Security Objective Description (ENISA, 2016A)  Data protection requirements  (ENISA, 2016B)  1.  Information  Security Policy  (art 2.1.a –  managing  information  security) [SO 01]  The DSP shall establish and maintain an information security  policy. The document details information on main assets and  processes, strategic security objectives.  Information System Security Policy should also explicitly address the  protection of personal data. (4.1.1.1)  2.  Risk Management  (art 2.1.a – risk  analysis) [SO 02]  The DSP shall establish and maintain an appropriate governance  and risk management framework, to identify and address risks for  the security of the offered services. Risk management  procedures can include (but are not limited to), maintaining a list  of risks and assets, using Governance Risk management and  Compliance (GRC) tools, Risk Assessment (RA) tools, etc.  The conducted risk analysis should cover risks to the rights and freedoms  of natural persons and consider the specificities of risk management for  personal data processing. In some cases, a Data Protection Impact  Assessment could be mandatory. Consider using DPIA tools and data  protection risk assessment methodologies9. (2.3.2, 3)  3.  Roles and  Responsibilities  (art 2.1.a – human  resources) [SO 03]  The DSP shall assign appropriate security roles as well as  security responsibilities to designated personnel (i.e. CSO, CISO,  CTO etc.).  Personnel with access to personal data should have clearly defined and  documented responsibilities. Relevant roles shall be based on a need to  know basis and frequently been reviewed. Consider the appointment of a  DPO10, which could be obligatory under article 37 of the GDPR11. (4.1.1.2)  4.  Background  checks  (art 2.1.a - human  resources) [SO 05]  The DSP shall perform appropriate background checks on  personnel (employees, contractors and third party users) before  hiring, if required, for their duties and responsibilities provided  that this is allowed by the local regulatory frame-work.  Background checks may include checking past jobs, checking  professional references, etc.  Background checks and any other processing of employees data for  security purposes should be in line with GDPR. Relevant guidance from  DPAs should be consulted 12  5.

The GDPR provides also for the right to portability18. For detailed  guidance see the relevant text endorsed by the EDPB19.  18 This is also linked to the \"Right to data portability\" established for individuals by GDPR article 20. Do notice that this right does not create a direct and absolute obligation to data controllers to transfer data to another  controller, but only when it is technically feasible.  19 See (ARTICLE 29 DATA PROTECTION WORKING PARTY, 2016)  STOCK TAKING OF SECURITY REQUIREMENTS SET BY DIFFERENT LEGAL  FRAMEWORKS ON OES AND DSPS  NOVEMBER 2019  25  3.2 Mapping of security measures stemming from Cooperation Group’s  guidance  3.2.1 How to use the tables  Typically, OESs belong to the class of large companies and are vital for the modern society and  the economy. Their operation is heavily dependent on ICT. However, they do not always rely on  personal data processing. Specialized security standards have been in place for many years for  each of these sectors20, while some of the sectors are also regulated from sectoral national  authorities. In addition, the level of dependence of each sector on ICT and the level of  correlation of each section with personal data processing varies drastically. However, since both  NISD and GDPR share a common information security background, categories of security  measures, as presented in the table above, cover similar or even the same security objectives.  We can distinguish in the following:   Domains that need to take into account data protection risks. These mostly include  domains related to Information System Security Governance, Risk Management,  Ecosystem Management and Incident Management.   Domains where the envisaged security objectives tend to be identical. Examples of  these domains are asset management, IT security and administration domains, identity  and access management and procedures related to IT maintenance, physical and  environmental security and continuity of operations.   Domains that are significantly critical for core OES activities. These domains include all  measures related to industrial control systems, where limited data processing  operations are expected, the level of logging analysis, which is dependent on the  expected high risk, communication with CSIRSTs and crisis management.   Domains that although, not included in the guidelines of the NIS Cooperation Group,  should also be considered, in case of processing of personal data (marked with ‘+’ in  the table). In the table above, two such security objectives are added. The first relates  to how an OES should develop (and not only maintain, that was already tackled)  applications related to personal data, while the second is related to GDPR’s principle of  storage limitation.  Our goal is to provide a table that can be used as a reference. OESs should assess whether  their existing security measures can successfully mitigate their risks, including those on data  protection, using the table to identify the security measures that should be enhanced. In doing  so, they need to analyse their operations and identify personal data processing activities that  are critical for the provision of their services. Clearly, there is no “one-size-fits-all” solution, even  within the same sector or subsector. For detailed guidance, operators should rely on appropriate  sector specific security standards21 and consult the available guidance documents.  3.2.2 Security requirements for OES  A similar approach for the security measures for OESs is proposed which uses the (NIS  Cooperation Group, 2018A) as a starting point for this exercise. In this reference document,  thirty (30) domains of security measures, divided into 4 parts, are identified. These domains are  listed in the second column of the table and cover the broad spectrum of security measures  relevant to an OES. The reader should consult the original document for the full description of  the security measures. Similarly to the previous section, this set of measures is mapped with  those presented in (ENISA, 2016B) which are related to data protection. Each measure is  analysed and additional measures are proposed for personal data security. In the third column,  a short description of the proposed enhancements accompanied by a reference –in parenthesis-  to the relevant  security measure, arising from (ENISA, 2016B), is provided.  20 See (ENISA, 2017B) for a thorough presentation  21 See (ENISA, 2017B)  http://ec.europa.eu/newsroom/dae/document.cfm?doc_id=53643 http://ec.europa.eu/newsroom/dae/document.cfm?doc_id=53643 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/guidelines-for-smes-on-the-security-of-personal-data-processing  STOCK TAKING OF SECURITY REQUIREMENTS SET BY DIFFERENT LEGAL  FRAMEWORKS ON OES AND DSPS  NOVEMBER 2019  26  To summarise the use of these tables, the OES should:  1. Start from (NIS Cooperation Group, 2018A) and assess whether existing security  measures can successfully mitigate the risks on the networks and information systems  by using the second column of the table.  2. Understand the additional elements required for personal data security by reading the  last column of the table.  3. Get deeper guidance on how this data protection security requirements might be  implemented from (ENISA, 2016B).

CONCLUSIONS -  RECOMMENDATIONS  NISD and GDPR have both reinforced the provisions on information security, but from a  different perspective. NISD aims to achieve a high level of resilience and security of network  and information systems for entities that are essential for the functioning of the European  economy, for the protection of critical services (e.g. health) as well as for the well-being of the  citizen. GDPR aims to strengthen the protection of personal data, reinforcing the provisions on  information security. Both legislative acts share a common information security background.  Operators of Essential Services and Digital Service Providers face the burden of compliance  with two sets of provisions with potential overlaps and unnecessary administrative burden.  This report aims to analyse the differences and similarities, based on ENISA technical  documents, identify the overlaps and provide guidance to OESs, DSPs as well as to  organisations that offer services to them, on how to implement technical and organisational  measures that are appropriate for both set of provisions. Compliance cannot be merely formal  or based on the implementation of closed checklists, but linked to the “context” where an  operation takes place and the actual risks. Undertakings should follow methodologies that fit to  their business sector to implement or assess their security measures, based on the pre-existing  guidance. The proposed list of security objectives is aimed to provide a good starting point for  this assessment.  While performing the analysis of selected measures categories, a number of conclusions and  relevant recommendations were drawn and are discussed below.  A common risk management framework  Since both the NISD and the GDPR follow a risk based approach, managing risks can be  achieved through one process by, taking into account security and data protection risks and  their essential differences, especially on the way the risks are mitigated. Undertakings can  benefit from a common risk management framework that uses common controls thus making it  efficient and cost-effective, while at the same time making it easy to support risk management  decisions. Notice that although there are security and privacy risk management frameworks32,  such an approach must be suitable for the EU legal framework and the notion of data protection  as envisaged with the GDPR. Such a harmonised approach could also be beneficial to other  legal frameworks that follow a risk based approach and can facilitate the establishment of the  Digital Single Market.  Specialized guidance on each sector  From the analysis presented, it is obvious that the level of risk depends on the exact information  (including personal data) processing activities and network dependencies of each entity.  However, a contextual analysis of risks cannot be performed uniformly for every industry sector  (or even subsector) that fall within the scope of the NISD. To further advance the level of  security of network and information systems and data protection one needs to explore these  activities and provide specialised guidance. A thorough analysis is required for each subsector,  32 E.g. NIST SP 800-37 Rev. 2, Risk Management Framework for Information Systems and Organizations: A System Life  Cycle Approach for Security and Privacy - https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800-37/rev-2/final  STOCK TAKING OF SECURITY REQUIREMENTS SET BY DIFFERENT LEGAL  FRAMEWORKS ON OES AND DSPS  NOVEMBER 2019  33  through cooperation of experts familiar with the particular subsector, security of network and  information systems and data protection.  Specialised guidance on emerging data protection and security techniques  Competent EU bodies and research bodies should continue to provide specialised guidance on  “state-of-the-art” data protection and security techniques. That will facilitate the adoption and  deployment of these techniques throughout EU.  Synergies between NISD and GDPR authorities  NISD competent authorities (and CSIRTs) and Data Protection Authorities should also establish  a method of cooperation, especially when dealing with security incidents. NISD provides for  such a cooperation, but it is left up to national legislation. In order to achieve a consistent level  of cooperation between these authorities, member states and authorities could benefit from a  list of recommendations on how to establish synergies and put into practise collaborative and  cooperative mechanisms.  Certifications  The new regulation on ENISA (''Cybersecurity Act'') provides for a role of the agency on  cybersecurity certification schemes. On the other hand, the GDPR provides for the  establishment of certification mechanisms for its own purposes. A channel of co-operation  between these two schemes could be explored in the future for the benefit of all involved parties  in the area of information security.

    "abstract": "In order to support organisations in their process of identifying appropriate security measures, based on the provisions of both NISD and GDPR, this report uses as basis the pre-existing ENISA guidance and presents a mapping of already identified security objectives, between the NISD and the GDPR. The report should be used as a starting point for the above-mentioned assessment and is targeted mainly to OESs and DSPs. Following the analysis in Sections 2, 3 and 4, this report concludes that organisations could benefit from a unified risk management framework, specialized sectorial guidance and specialised guidance on emerging privacy and security techniques. It also proposes that a method of cooperation between competent NISD and GDPR authorities as well as a co-ordinated approach on certifications concerning information security issues would be beneficial for the Digital Single Market."

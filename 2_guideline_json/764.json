This publication explains how drive‐by downloads operate and how compromise from these techniques can  be mitigated.  What happens in a drive-by download?  A drive‐by download occurs when a user visits a legitimate but compromised website. When the user accesses the  website, an adversary’s malicious code exploits weaknesses or other security vulnerabilities in the user’s web browser  or web browser plug‐ins allowing the download of malicious files to the user's computer. The downloaded files enable  the adversary to have full access and control of the user's computer, either to steal valuable information or to launch  denial-of-service attacks against other users on the internet.  Another form of a drive‐by download is ‘malvertisement’, which is commonly Flash Player-based and takes advantage  of unpatched software. Disguised as legitimate advertisers, an adversary implants their malicious software in an  advertisement on a legitimate website. When a user views the advertisement, the malware infects their computer.  Most drive‐by downloads require scripts to be loaded from third party websites. An adversary can inject inline frame  codes into legitimate websites, which then load malicious software hosted on other websites operated by the  adversary when a compromised website is visited.  Search Engine Optimisation (SEO) is another technique often used in conjunction with a drive‐by download exploit. SEO  increases a website’s visibility in a search engine. Generally, the higher or more often a website appears in a search  result, the more traffic the website is likely to receive from the search engine’s users. An adversary can use SEO to  promote their malicious websites in search engines to increase the chance of getting traffic to their website for the  exploit to occur.  There are malware kits available which target specific web browsers or software flaws, including Adobe Reader,  Microsoft Internet Explorer and web browser plug‐ins. The server to which these kits are connected can use HTTP  request headers from a web browser, to determine which specific exploits are most likely to work on a user’s  computer.  Mitigating drive-by downloads  To mitigate drive‐by downloads, the following mitigation strategies should be implemented:   Implement application control. In many successful cyber security incidents application control would have been  the only mitigation strategy able to stop drive-by downloads from executing malicious software.  Mitigating Drive-by Downloads  First published: December 2011  Last updated: October 2021  2   Patch applications and operating system security vulnerabilities, especially Java and Flash. Old versions of  applications are more vulnerable to drive-by downloads. Keep all applications up-to-date.   Minimise the use of domain and administrator privileges. Limit the ability for users with domain or administrator  privileges to have access to email and the internet by employing separate unprivileged workstations or accounts  for these purposes.  Organisations should also consider implementing the following mitigation strategies:   Implement robust web content filtering that inspects the content of all web traffic for potentially malicious  downloads and blocks it. Preferably block ActiveX, Java, Flash, HTML inline frames and JavaScript, except from a  list of approved websites.   Implement a list of approved domains, including HTTPS domains, to only allow trusted domains to be accessed by  users. This will not prevent drive‐by downloads but it will prevent secondary malicious websites from loading.   Install and maintain updated antivirus software capable of scanning internet traffic and detecting exploits.

In terms of cybersecurity challenges, it also proved to be the second year of living with the pandemic  and a prelude to the first year of Russia’s unprovoked and illegal war on Ukraine, whose cyber dimension started  far earlier than the actual invasion and is likely to outlive the atrocities of the current physical confrontation.  As an agency, I believe we have learned quickly and have adapted well to both of these external shocks.  The same year showed that we were able to deliver on ENISA’s strategic objectives, pursuing a resilient and  clear path towards making Europe more cybersecure, as well as adapting our activities to these changing  circumstances. Knowing that the political leadership in the EU and in the Member State prioritises cybersecurity  continues to be a real boost for the work and motivation of the Agency. The Agency fully carried out its mandate  and tasks fully to step up and support the Union by way of the following activities executed in 2021.  The adoption and implementation of policy frameworks is one key response area where the EU is making  a difference. Indeed, the policies and initiatives to be put in place in the coming years will determine how the  EU faces the cybersecurity challenges of today and tomorrow. Within this framework, ENISA supported Member  States with the technical aspects related to Directive (EU) 2016/1148 (the Network and Information security  directive (NISD)), and supported the European Parliament and Commission with regard to negotiations on  a revised NISD (NISD2) by providing technical expertise through written contributions on supply chain and on  the security requirements of the new sector. As connectivity and interdependencies between sectors grow, the  proposed expansion of scope under the new NISD2 will cover more sectors and entities, will incentivise these  to take better cybersecurity measures and will help fill the persistant gaps, for example in the area of incident- reporting practices. The NISD2 negotiations between the European Parliament and the Council of the European  Union have shown a unique cross-party / cross-Member State consensus in favour of this world-leading  legislative approach.  The second ENISA network and information security investment study, published in 2021, showed that incentives  to invest properly in cybersecurity were still missing. The majority of operators of essential services and digital  service providers acknowledged a significant positive impact of the NISD, particularly in detecting information  security incidents. However, the implementation of the NISD did not necessarily result in substantial increases  in the cybersecurity budgets of organisations. There is still much room for improvement here.  The agency organised and co-organised a number of exercises to test decision-making, internal communication  and business continuity. These exercises go a long way in preparing to respond to cyberthreats and incidents,  raising resilience and increasing preparedness across the EU.  ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2021 7  In area of operational cooperation, ENISA continued to work closely with other European Union institutions,  bodies and agencies (EUIBAs), and we were recently reminded by the regular Court of Auditors report that this  is an area that needs closer attention. A new memorandum of understanding was signed with the Computer  Emergency Response Team for the EU Institutions, Bodies and Agencies (CERT-EU) leveraging on the structured  collaboration in accordance with the Cybersecurity Act. The annual plan included activities to further develop  the Blueprint. ENISA and CERT-EU have aligned actions on developing EUIBA standard operating procedures and  improving the Union’s common situational awareness.  2021 also saw ENISA further its operational cooperation mandate by working with Member States to consolidate  cyber situational awareness analyses with a focus on cyber incidents in the EU and also the impact of incidents  from across the world on Europe. ENISA’s cyber situational awareness services were provided to EUIBAs and  authorities in Member States’ authorities through regular weekly reports and ad hoc threat research. In the context  of the Joint Cyber Unit initiative, ENISA organised a dedicated workshop to tackle the challenges in this area.  In relation to the EU cybersecurity certification framework, in 2021 ENISA prepared a candidate scheme on  European common criteria (EUCC) for cybersecurity certification scheme. Once adopted, this will become the  first EU scheme of its kind. In 2022 the candidate scheme on European cloud services will also be submitted  following tough talks in the ENISA working group. Furthermore, an ad hoc working group began working in 2021  to prepare a candidate certification scheme for 5G networks. Finalising the candidate schemes for specialised  product categories under the EUCC scheme and for cloud services is just the first step, and it is likely to bring  about benefits in terms of recognition and trust across government services, business and citizens.  The publication of the 9th edition of ENISA’s annual threat landscape report1 confirmed current and future trends  that cyberattacks are becoming ever more sophisticated, targeted, widespread, unattributable and detected too  late. These continue to be global trends and their impact was felt in Europe as anywhere else. Cybercriminals are  increasingly motivated by monetisation of their activities such as ransomware, the focus of the 9th ENISA threat  landscape report. In addition, supply chain attacks of a highly sophisticated and impactful nature proliferated, as  highlighted by the dedicated ENISA threat landscape on supply chains.  ENISA worked closely with the European Cybersecurity Competence Centre (ECCC) on the set-up phase and  engaged in discussions with the centre in relation to joint administrative services. ENISA identified research  and innovation needs and priorities in the field of life science cryptography, artificial intelligence and  hyperconnectivity, with the goal of preparing future funding priorities for the ECCC. As a permanent observer on  the governing board, ENISA played an active part in the activities of the Competence Centre. ENISA endeavoured  to ensure that relevant synergies could be developed, and to provide relevant input during the preparation of the  ECCC agenda, work programmes and multiannual work programme.  Russia’s war in the Ukraine has once again made clear that ENISA cannot operate in an EU vacuum. That is why  we equipped ourselves with an international strategy in late 2021 to offer more focused support to the Union  when it comes to addressing countries outside the Union.  The Agency reorganisation initiated in 2020 took full effect in 2021. The new internal organisation was designed  to be aligned with the requirements of the Cybersecurity Act and with the strategic objectives and priorities of  the newly developed strategy. The new structure was meant to ensure more effective implementation of the  tasks defined in our now permanent mandate to steadily move towards ‘a trusted and cybersecure Europe’2.  The Agency developed new key performance indicators and accompanying metrics during the reporting year,  which served to improve the reporting of the 11 activities of the present annual activity report.  I am very proud to report that, thanks to the alignment of the Agency’s structure with the Cybersecurity Act,  I can see now how all staff members and associated parties of the Agency performed their tasks and exercised  their related duties in a more coherent and coordinated manner, thus better serving the objectives of the  Agency’s mission. There is no doubt that a lot of work remains to be done and that fine-tuning will be needed  1 ENISA, ENISA Threat Landscape 2021 – April 2020 to mid-July 2021, 27 October 2021  (https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/enisa-threat-landscape-2021).  2 ENISA strategy - https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/corporate-documents/a-trusted-and-cyber-secure-europe-enisa-strategy  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/enisa-threat-landscape-2021 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/corporate-documents/a-trusted-and-cyber-secure-europe-enisa-strategy  8  over the coming years to adjust to our very fast-developing cybersecurity world and the inevitable challenges  associated with it.  In the meantime, I see the success of the 2021 work programme as a testimony to the capacity of the new  structure of the Agency to gather all the required synergies to deliver its mandate in the most effective way.  Thanks to the support of the Greek authorities, the Agency planned, prepared and moved to its new  headquarters building in Chalandri, Athens, ensuring minimal disruption to its operations.  This is why I cannot be thankful enough to all our stakeholders who contributed to these endeavours in 2021  and without whom ENISA could not deliver its work and support the cybersecurity communities of the EU.  I remain grateful for the ever so fruitful cooperation we enjoyed with our communities, with the European  institutions and bodies, and, last but not least, with each Member State of the EU .  I also feel very grateful for the renewed commitment of ENISA’s staff, including the 31 newcomers whom the agency  welcomed in 2021. It is a great satisfaction to me to see how they continued to welcome and embrace our tasks and  challenges in such a positive spirit. This is obviously the motivation we need to trigger if we want to successfully achieve  our vision of a trusted and secure Europe.  Juhan Lepassaar Executive Director, ENISA  ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2021 9  1  ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2021 111  Analyses and assessment by the management board  of ENISA of the Annual Activity Report for the year  2021 of the authorising officer of ENISA  The Management Board takes note of the  consolidated Annual Activity Report (AAR) for the  financial year 2021, submitted by the Executive  Director of the European Union Agency for  Cybersecurity (ENISA) in accordance with Article 48  of the Financial Regulation applicable to ENISA.  The Executive Board received a copy of the draft AAR  2021 produced by the Executive Director of ENISA in  his role as Authorising Officer for the implementation  of the annual budget on 11 May 2022 and the  Management Board received a copy of the draft AAR  2021 on 2 June 2022.  The Management Board performed the analysis  of the AAR and completed its assessment.  The conclusions of the Management Board are  the following:  The 2021 AAR represents the first full year when  ENISA’s new strategy (adopted by the Management  Board in June 2020) and its renewed Work  Programme were operational. In addition, structural  changes were introduced in 2021 for the effective  execution of ENISA’s mandate and strategy. A new  organisational structure was approved by the  Management Board in 2020, effective as of the  1st January 2021.  The challenging circumstances around the COVID  19 pandemic continued well into 2021 that required  the Agency to adjust its meetings to the online  environment and continuation of 50% office / 50%  teleworking arrangements for staff.  The Agency was able to meet the objectives set  in the work programme 2021 as shown by the  results presented in the report.  The AAR presents key results of the implementation of  the ENISA work programme 2021 thus demonstrating  how the Agency successfully completed all outputs  as agreed with the Management Board in the work  programme 2021.  ENISA involved stakeholder in the scoping and  validation of all outputs in the work programme  2021, ensuring the added-value and take-up of ENISA  deliverables by stakeholders, whether reports, tools,  workshops or recommendations.  Newly formulated key performance indicators  were reported in the AAR. These indicators provide  quantitative and qualitative assessment of each of the  operational and corporate activities and will be used  as a baseline for future years.  Overall, the AAR is in line with the ENISA work  programme 2021 and ENISA’s work is well aligned  with the overall European Union priorities for the  Digital Single Market. A coherent link is provided  ENISA MANAGEMENT  BOARD ASSESSMENT  12  between activities planned in the work programme  2021 and the actual achievements reached in the  reporting period.  The AAR also describes how ENISA managed its  resources and presents the budget execution of the  EU subsidy. In the course of 2021, the Agency has  been operating with a budget of EUR 23.5 million  equivalent to an 8% increase in 2021 compared to the  2020 budget (EUR 21.7 million)  During 2021, ENISA committed a total amount of  EUR 22 721 149 representing 99.51 % of the total  budget for the year. Payments made during the year  amounted to EUR 17 672 344 representing 77.40%  of the total budget. The execution of the budget  has been high despite the restrictive circumstances  imposed by COVID-19.  As compared to 2020, there has been a slight increase  in the execution of commitments, 99.51% in 2021  as compared to 97.35% in the previous year, and  an increase in the execution of payments, 77.40%  as compared to 68.62% in 2020. The target of a  95% for commitment rate set by the Commission  (DG Budget) was reached.  The turnover of staff was greatly reduced in 2021.  The ratio was only 3% which shows improvement  in retaining staff members in the Agency.  Furthermore, a combined recruitment procedure  organised in 2020 allowed the Agency to progress  rapidly in fulfilling its establishment plan with 31 new  recruits welcomed in 2021.  The AAR also provides information on the internal  control assessment for 2021. This section notes the  main categories of deviation that led to exceptions  reported. In 2021 the Agency reported three  exceptions in the AAR. None of these exceptions  has a serious impact for the Agency.  ENISA adopted the revised internal control framework  at the end of 2019. The AAR 2021 shows the adequate  management of risks, a high level of transparency,  clear governance structures and improved  performance monitoring.  The Management Board notes that infringement  of the use of delegation powers and weaknesses in  internal controls framework were identified by the  European Court Auditors. The Board concludes that  necessary actions were undertaken within 2021 to  improve the overall efficiency of the Agency in abiding  to its principles and congratulates ENISA for all the  efforts engaged to that end.  The annexes complete the AAR with a declaration  of assurance of the Executive Director as well as  additional information on human and financial  resources, draft annual accounts and financial  reports, as well as performance information  included in evaluations.  Overall, the Management Board takes note of the  successful achievements of ENISA in 2021. The  Management Board notes with satisfaction that ENISA  was able to deliver the work programme 2021 despite  the continued conditions due to COVID -19 showing  exceptional flexibility and efficiency in challenging  circumstances. The Management Board expresses  its deep appreciation to the Executive Director and  his staff for their commitment and the excellent  performance throughout the year.  In light of the above assessment, the Management  Board requests the Management Board Secretariat  to forward the AAR, together with this assessment, to  the European Commission, the European Parliament,  the Council, the Permanent Representations of the  Member States and the Court of Auditors.  ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2021 13  INTRODUCTION  1  ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2021 151  Implementation of the agency’s annual work  programme and highlights of the year  The mission of the European Union Agency for  Cybersecurity (ENISA) is to achieve a high common  level of cybersecurity across the Union in cooperation  with the wider community. To do so, the Agency acts  as a centre of expertise on cybersecurity, and collects  and provides independent, high-quality technical  advice and assistance to Member States and EU  bodies. ENISA is committed to strengthening trust in  the connected economy, boosting the resilience of  and trust in the Union’s infrastructure and services,  and keeping our society and citizens digitally  secure. The Agency therefore strives to be an agile,  environmentally and socially responsible organisation  focused on people.  The Cybersecurity Act (CSA) has now been  implemented for two years since it came into force  in 2019. 2020 was the first full year the Agency  functionned under the new organisation structure  which aligns with the new mandate and the newly  formed strategy.  The task assigned to ENISA under this regulation is to  achieve a high common level of cybersecurity across  the Union, including actively supporting Member  States, and Union institutions, bodies, offices and  agencies, in improving cybersecurity.  In the area of policy ENISA supported the  development of new policy files such as the  revised Network and Information Security directive  (NISD2), the Digital Operational Resilience Act  (DORA), electronic identification, authentication  and trust services (eIDAS), the European Electronic  Communications Code, 5G, digital wallets, artificial  intelligence (AI) and the Network CODE on cyber  security (NCCS). ENISA’s work in these areas delivers  evidence to inform future policy decisions with  a view to strengthening the EU policy and regulatory  framework to address cybersecurity challenges.  ENISA continued its efforts in supporting Member  States with technical aspects related to Directive  (EU) 2016/1148 (the network and information  security directive (NISD)), security of electronic  communications, data protection, privacy, electronic  identification, trust services, incident reporting  and vulnerability disclosure policies. It continued  its support of established groups, such as the NIS  Cooperation Group, its work streams, European  Competent Authorities for Security of Electronic  Communications Group and the ENISA eIDAS  regulation Article 19 expert group. A key highlight  is the support ENISA provided in relation to the  review of the NISD and the proposal for new sectors.  Furthermore, ENISA contributed to the ongoing  development of additional policy files, such as on  DORA, AI and Network CODE on cyber security (NCCS).  EXECUTIVE SUMMARY  16  In 2021, ENISA contributed to the improvement of  capabilities of Member States and EU institutions,  bodies and agencies (EUIBAs), raising resilience and  increasing preparedness across the EU. Capacity  across the Union was built by the organisation and  the setting up of several exercises, including Cyber  Europe, the Blueprint Operational Level Exercise  and CyberSOPEx, as well as in-depth training and  accompanying tabletop exercises in support of the  maturity and skills of computer security incident  response teams (CSIRTs) and other communities.  In addition, the Agency assisted Member States in  measuring the maturity level of national cybersecurity  strategies by developing an online tool to assist  Member States to perform a self-assessment exercise  with the aim of improving national cybersecurity  capabilities by conducting an evaluation of their  national cybersecurity capabilities, enhancing  awareness of the country’s maturity level and  identifying areas for improvement in building  cybersecurity capabilities.  During 2021, ENISA supported and coordinated  a number of networks and technical/operational  communities. ENISA supported the activities of the  CSIRTs Network in implementing the network’s work  programme for 2021, and aided the networks during  high-profile incidents that required escalation,  such as during the Member States exchange Log4j  vulnerability. ENISA actively supported the newly  established Cyber Crisis Liaison Network (CyCLONe)  by carrying out activities designed to improve  information sharing and operational cooperation,  in particular regarding automated reporting, impact  assessment and situational awareness. ENISA  also engaged in the initial activities related to the  proposal for a Joint Cyber Unit by contributing to  and organising several workshops. All these activities  helped to identify best practices, challenges and  opportunities with a view to improving operational  cooperation, situational awareness and coordination  for incident response in the EU.  Moreover, ENISA contributed to the development  of effective operational cooperation among Member  States and EUIBAs by generating and consolidating  information (including from the general public) on  cyber situational awareness, technical situational  reports (threat reports), incident reports and threats.  ENISA also actively supported the consolidation and  exchange of information on strategic, tactical and  technical levels to operational communities, such  as the CSIRTs Network and CyCLONe.  In the area of certification, ENISA had made  meaningful contributions to the EU cybersecurity  certification framework; it had shifted from one  mature scheme to two and it had a third one in the  works. ENISA started populating the cybersecurity  market analysis area, and redirected standardisation  to fit its dual purpose across cybersecurity policy  and cybersecurity certification, while developing  its relationship with European standardisation  organisations yet further. ENISA assisted the  Commission with regard to cybersecurity certification  bodies – the European Cybersecurity Certification  Group (ECCG) and Stakeholder Cybersecurity  Certification Group – and continued developing its  capability to service the Commission and the Member  States on cybersecurity certification by producing  guidance on the candidate cybersecurity certification  scheme on European common criteria (EUCC) for  which the ECCG gave a favourable opinion.  On the basis of an open consultation, the draft  candidate cybersecurity certification scheme on  European cloud services (EUCS) was reprocessed  and to a great extent finalised. Gradually, the  interest in EUCS shifted towards data localisation  and aspects of digital sovereignty. ENISA processed  a request for a scheme on 5G certification, which  was successfully launched following thorough  consultation with stakeholders.  Kicking off a new area, ENISA prepared  a cybersecurity market analysis framework and  a targeted analysis of the market for connected  devices in energy. In terms of standardisation,  ENISA launched specific requests to the European  Committee for Standardisation (CEN) and the  European Committee for Electrotechnical  Standardisation (CENELEC), and provided guidance  on 5G standards and related organisations and  on risk management.  ENISA worked on various fronts in terms  of consolidating information, analysing it, and  providing analyses and recommendations to serve  stakeholders’ expectations. Most notable examples of  ENISA’s efforts in the area of knowledge on emerging  cybersecurity challenges include designing the EU  cybersecurity index, publishing the annual threat  landscape and the supply chain attacks threat  landscape and in particular supporting the European  Cybersecurity Competence Centre, by identifying the  priorities in research and innovation priorities.  Behavioural change is the cornerstone of  cybersecurity awareness and education, and  requires persistent long-term effort, well-defined  objectives, identified target groups, and particularly  specific and relevant metrics and indicators for  measuring change. Given this, in 2021 ENISA laid  the groundwork for all the awareness activities to  ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2021 17  INTRODUCTION  be undertaken by the Agency in the coming years:  specifically, the development of a stakeholder  strategy; an awareness-raising framework, with a set  of processes and requirements for organising an  awareness-raising campaign; and finally a promotion  and dissemination strategy, presenting the most  effective means and channels to use for different  target audiences.  A number of structural changes were introduced in  2021 for the effective execution of ENISA’s mandate  and strategy. A new organisational structure was  approved by the Management Board in 2020, effective  as of 1 January 2021. The new organisational structure  aligns the tasks and functions of the Agency’s structural  set-up with the CSA, and ensures that all entities and  all staff members of the Agency exercise their tasks  and obligations in line with the Agency’s mission and  values, striving to reach and maintain the highest level  of openness, transparency and ethical standards.  The management team was established to assist  the Executive Director in his functions, ensuring that  activities undertaken by the Agency under its work  programme add value for the Union and are planned  and implemented in a coordinated fashion. A total  of six units were established: four operational units  tasked with Articles 5–7 of the CSA, and two corporate  units responsible for the administrative functions. In  addition, four teams were established, tasked with  Articles 8–12 and 42 of the CSA.  Two new committees were established in 2021  to help the Agency carry out its tasks. The  Budget Management Committee ensures the  coherent planning, implementation and follow- up of the Agency’s budget, and the Information  Technology Management Committee ensures the  comprehensive and coordinated management of  the Agency’s information technology systems and  services required to fulfil its core tasks.  Lastly, the Agency, with the agreement of the Greek  authorities, moved into new premises in Athens in  order to meet the growing needs of the Agency, and  a local office in Brussels was established to support  the implementation of structured cooperation with  Union institutions.  I  ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2021 19  The following sections of the Annual Activity Report are based  on the structure of the European Union Agency for Cybersecurity  (ENISA) Programming Document 2021–2023. The achievements  of each activity are described, including details of the outcome  of each output undertaken during the course of 2021.  PART I ACHIEVEMENTS OF THE YEAR  20  ACTIVITY 1 Providing assistance on policy  development  ENISA supported the objective of having cybersecurity included as an integral part of EU policy by  providing services related to the development of new policy files, by collecting evidence to support the  effectiveness of the existing policy framework and by providing EU policymakers and stakeholders with  policy recommendations on future cybersecurity challenges and opportunities.  Achievements ENISA actively contributed to 26 task forces and bodies, 161 workshops and conferences, and 6 European  Commission and Member State initiatives in response to requests. The budget allocated to this activity  went almost entirely into activities related to the collection of evidence for assessing existing policies or  developing new ones, including expanding the network and information security (NIS) investments report to  cover all 27 EU Member States. The Agency also participated in public hearings organised by the European  Parliament and followed up the trialogues. This is how the agency ‘ensured that EU policymakers are regularly  informed about the effectiveness of the existing frameworks and provided with timely and tailor-made policy  recommendations’. Activities related to the analysis and interpretation of the evidence itself were performed  using internal resources. The development of internal capabilities and skillsets to perform such analyses is under  way and will be the focus of the years to come.  The Agency developed internal positions, in cooperation with other teams and units, to support the relevant  competent authorities of the Commission and Member States (e.g. on supply chains and on the security  requirements of new sectors under the proposed revised network and information security directive (NISD2)),  the European Parliament and Council of the European Union with targeted policy analysis and reports.  ENISA developed targeted products and services (e.g. the NIS investments report) following an evidence-based  approach in order to ‘regularly inform EU policymakers about the effectiveness of the existing framework’. In  this context, the Agency established the EU Cybersecurity Policy Observatory (CSPO) as an internal function  to support evidence-based policymaking and inform policymakers through the provision of relevant evidence  and expert advice. The EU CSPO will help the Agency to contribute efficiently to an increasing number  of cybersecurity EU policies.  Strategic cooperation ENISA maintained and even further developed strategic relationships and cooperation with a number  of directorates-general. Examples include the support given by ENISA to the Directorate-General for  Communications Networks, Content and Technology (DG Connect) and to the European Parliament with regard  to NISD2 negotiations, its support to the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority and the  European Banking Authority in preparation for the Digital Operational Resilience Act (DORA) legislation, and its  support to the European Union Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators (ACER) for the development  of the Network CODE on cyber security (NCCS).  The work of ENISA during the reporting period offered insights into aspects of the impact of policy that so far  had not been visible to the EU or to national policymakers in the EU. The NIS investments report is a good  example of a maturing product, as it provides the concrete evidence needed to support the evaluation of the  impact of Directive (EU) 2016/1148 (the network and information security directive (NISD)) on the cybersecurity  of operators of essential services (OESs) / digital service providers (DSPs), and allows the identification of potential  gaps and opportunities. When moving from horizontal policy and regulatory instruments, such as the NISD, and  into sectoral analyses, the positive impact of the Agency’s activities had been limited by the fragmentation of the  policy responsibilities of the competent authorities of the Member States on cybersecurity matters. In order to  address this issue, ENISA closely engaged with the European Commission and the Member States, and still does so  to facilitate the development of appropriate forums and interfaces to support sector-focused discussions.  ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2021 21  PART I. Achievements of the year  ENISA was able to deliver opinions and written contributions on all topics identified by the Commission as  priorities. A key highlight of this activity is the support ENISA provided in relation to the review of the NISD  and the proposal for new sectors.  Resources ENISA’s ability to support different stages of the policy development life cycle is currently limited by a lack  of available human resources (HR) and a lack of relevant skills. There is a proliferation of sectoral or thematic  policy initiatives that include cybersecurity requirements as part of a broader policy intervention, but the Agency  does not necessarily have the resources to follow up all of them. The EU cybersecurity observatory (CSPO  could provide a framework for prioritisation and improved resource allocation, which would partly address  the problem of limited HR and pertinent skills.  Overall assessment The outputs of this activity are relevant and timely but require prioritisation from the Agency to best adapt  them to the available resources. With NISD2 bringing ever more sectors under the scope of the directive, it  is also essential that the policy frameworks of these sectors take account of cybersecurity aspects. However,  the Agency will never have sufficient resources to monitor and offer advice on each sector separately. Thus,  the EU CSPO is the concept to be applied to achieve this objective as the number of EU policies increase. The  implementation of the EU CSPO and its synergy with the foresight capabilities currently being developed within  the Agency are expected to enhance ENISA’s advisory capabilities on emerging areas. It will also allow the Agency  to bring emerging/future topics of interest to the attention of EU policymakers and stakeholders. Through this  process, areas and topics not currently part of the policy agenda can be thoroughly assessed at EU level in order  to identify in advance potential needs for policy intervention. The activity could benefit from having additional  experts familiar with the EU policy development life cycle, but also from having additional budget to further  deploy professional market intelligence in support of the CSPO.  The three outputs of the activity are relevant, as they meet the objectives of the activity and of the relevant  strategic objective with a minor change in the scope of output 1.3, which should be policy independent and also  allow for the development of a registry of EU cybersecurity policies. As regards the key performance indicators  (KPIs), the measurement of references to ENISA’s work in national policy documents (metric 1.2) proved difficult  given the language constraints of such an endeavour. Instead, the Agency proposes to focus the metric on the  EU level only and to extend the scope to include reports to which the Agency contributed (e.g. reports of the NIS  Cooperation Group).  Objectives  •  Foster cybersecurity as an integral part  of EU policy (existing and new)  •  Regularly inform EU policymakers about the  effectiveness of the existing framework  •  Provide EU policymakers and stakeholders  with timely and tailor-made policy  recommendations on future cybersecurity  challenges and opportunities  Link to strategic objective  (ENISA strategy)  •  Cybersecurity as an integral part of EU policies  Results  •  Where relevant, support the European Commission in ensuring that EU and national policies take  cybersecurity aspects into account  22  Outputs  1.1.  Issue reports, studies  and analyses on the  effectiveness of the  current cybersecurity  policy framework in  requested areas and  according to the relevant  best practices  1.2.  Support the European  Commission and Member  States by providing  tailor-made advice and  recommendations on  new policy initiatives  that tackle emerging  technological, societal  and economic trends  Outcome  •  ENISA published the second NIS investments report, providing  policymakers with insights into the cybersecurity budgets of OESs  and DSPs and how these budgets were influenced by the NISD, in  order to inform future policy decisions.  •  ENISA produced a stocktaking report to support evidence-based  policymaking in the health sector by providing sectoral national  competent authorities with relevant facts and with a gap analysis.  •  The Agency supported ACER by providing guidance on the framework  guidelines for the network code on the cybersecurity of cross-border  electricity flows.  •  ENISA contributed to the development of the Network CODE on  cyber security (NCCS) by participating in the drafting team. In this  context, ENISA organised a workshop in Athens in September for  the technical subgroup on information sharing.  The NIS investments report is available online  (https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/nis-investments-2021).  The output achieved its objectives in 2021. Its scope remains timely  and relevant. Based on ENISA’s assessment, it should remain in the  2023 single programming document (SPD).  •  ENISA continued supporting the European Commission and the  European Parliament with regard to NISD2 negotiations by:  –  providing technical expertise through written contributions  on supply chains and on the security requirements of new sector  under NISD2;  –  participating in several ad hoc meetings and delivering  technical briefings.  •  In the area of artificial intelligence (AI), ENISA:  –  supported the European Commission and Member States  by contributing to the public consultation on AI proposal for  a regulation, organising regular meetings and contributing to the  activities of the competent authorities for AI Member State-driven  working group;  –  collected and analysed data on AI cybersecurity strategies  and policies.  •  ENISA provided support to the European Commission and the  Directorate-General for Financial Stability, Financial Services  and Capital Markets in relation to the legislation for DORA for  the financial sector. ENISA supported the European Insurance  and Occupational Pensions Authority and the European Banking  Authority on harmonisation of incident reporting in preparation  for the DORA legislation.  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/nis-investments-2021  ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2021 23  PART I. Achievements of the year  1.3.  Assist the Commission in  reviewing the NIS directive  •  ENISA participated in the European Strategic Coordination Platform  with the objective of preparing the proposal for the regulation of  the European Union Aviation Safety Agency, and provided written  contributions on the acceptable means of compliance and guidance  material, which defines the details of the sectoral policy.  •  ENISA established the EU CSPO, which aims to support the European  Commission and Member States in different stages of the policy life  cycle through services focused on evidence-based policymaking and  systematic cybersecurity policy observation.  The output achieved its objectives in 2021. Its scope remains timely  and relevant. Based on ENISA’s assessment, it should remain in the  2023 SPD.  •  ENISA supported the consultations on the NISD proposal by  providing written contributions to the European Commission and by  organising meetings with it. In this context, the Agency prepared two  technical reports – one on the new sectors’ security requirements  in NISD2 and the other on good practices in supply chains – and  engaged in more than 15 virtual meetings with the Commission and  representatives of the European Parliament.  The output achieved its objectives in 2021. Its scope remains timely  and relevant, but it must be policy independent and also allow for  the development of a registry of EU cybersecurity policies. With this  change, the output should be included in the 2023 SPD.

The agency contributed to the  effective implementation of cybersecurity policy across the EU, and to the approximation of Member  State laws, regulations and administrative provisions related to cybersecurity.  Achievements The coordination and prioritisation of the Agency’s work based on available resources had a positive impact, as it  benefited from regular interactions with established groups and EU bodies such as DG Connect, the Directorate- General for Energy, the Body of European Regulators for Electronic Communications, the NIS Cooperation Group  (CG), ACER, the European Union Agency for Railways (ERA), the European Data Protection Supervisor (EDPS) and  the European Data Protection Board. Prominent examples in support of the relevant strategic objectives include:  •  providing support to 10 active work streams of the NISD Cooperation Group to help them meet their  objectives, contributing to the development of targeted reports on emerging issues (e.g. open radio access  network (O-RAN), top-level domain registry operators, domain name system (DNS) resolvers, coordinated  vulnerability disclosure policies) and organising knowledge-building seminars, thus contributing ‘to the  effective implementation of cybersecurity policy across the EU and approximation of Member State laws,  regulations and administrative provisions related to cybersecurity’ (SPD Activity 2 objective);  •  strengthening its sectoral approach to NISD implementation by developing vertical sectoral products  (e.g. a railway sector threat landscape, the Maritime Sector Risk Management Tool, the 5G matrix and an  energy threat landscape), building strategic relationships between horizontal and sectoral stakeholders,  linking operational cooperation and capacity building, and engaging with sectoral information-sharing  and analysis centres (ISACs) to ‘Align horizontal cybersecurity policies with sectoral polices and avoid  implementation inconsistencies’ (SPD Activity 2 objective);  •  building on the 5G toolbox with the development of a 5G control matrix, pursuing a leading role in the  establishment of the EU digital wallet toolbox, following Recommendation (EU) 2021/946 and thus contributing  ‘to the effective implementation of cybersecurity policy across the EU’ (SPD Activity 2 objective);  •  developing several focused publications targeting the needs of stakeholders to help them implement particular  policy aspects (e.g. SIM swapping, DNS resolvers, data protection engineering) and also events that brought  together stakeholders to discuss good policy options, such as the 1st ENISA Telecom Security Forum and the  7th ENISA Trust Services Forum;  •  supporting incident notification processes in accordance with Article 5(6) of the Cybersecurity Act (CSA), for  incident reporting under the European Electronic Communications Code (EECC), Regulation (EU) 910/2014  (the eIDAS regulation) and the NISD, delivering three annual EU-wide incident reports, and a prototype  for a consolidated EU incident-reporting dashboard.  Resources The available human and budgetary resources were divided between performing analyses of technical aspects  on validated priority areas, promoting good practices, engaging relevant communities and providing support  to formally established groups and bodies, such as the NIS CG. The NIS CG work programme reached a high  maturity level with 10 active work streams, meaning that the Agency had to prioritise, taking into account political  priorities and emerging legislative portfolios such as the EU digital wallet toolbox.  Policy development and implementation tasks cannot be easily outsourced or subcontracted. They require  analytical skills of senior experts of the Agency. It is a major challenge for the Agency to recruit and retain  ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2021 25  PART I. Achievements of the year  talented senior cybersecurity experts combining holistic policy expertise with technical expertise to support the  technical aspects of the implementation of cybersecurity policy.  In addition, the implementation of the NISD2 proposal, as well as important sectoral initiatives (e.g. DORA,  Network CODE on cyber security (NCCS), and the Aviation horizontal rule), will require a lot of resources in the  coming years to address the new tasks and also to cover all the new critical sectors and sustain the existing ones.  Overall assessment Currently, the sectoral cybersecurity policy development and implementation activities across the Union are  often unaligned and, thus, fragmented. A more holistic approach is required to align sectoral with horizontal  policies, to avoid inconsistencies, gaps, barriers and inefficiencies. However, the more sectoral initiatives  emerge, the greater the expectations are on ENISA’s contribution and engagement, thus creating resource  constraints on meeting these expectations. This means there is a need for prioritisation that would take into  consideration factors such as the maturity of the sectors trends in technology, criticality, recent incidents  and emerging threats. During the reporting year, ENISA worked on developing an NIS strategy intended to  streamline its services into standard packages for the NIS sectors, and target the different NIS sectors following  a careful assessment of sectoral needs and requirements.  Furthermore, an important opportunity lies in connecting the development and implementation of sectoral  cybersecurity policy with operational cooperation and capacity building. The experience of 2021 shows how  lessons learned in operational cooperation can feed into policy development and implementation as well as  capacity building to result in better and more targeted actions. This means that the agency will seek synergies  and align the work under Activities 1 and 2 with the work under Activities 3, 4 and 5 in the ENISA SPD. To achieve  the intended results, the Agency will prioritise its efforts and properly utilise its existing resources properly by  developing an NIS strategy that will partly address the problem. Still, additional resources will be needed in the  near future to deal with the new tasks under NISD2 as well as sectoral policy initiatives (e.g. DORA and Network  CODE on cyber security (NCCS). Seconded national experts can actually be one of the possible solutions to  address this problem because of their great experience with the implementation of national policy.  The outputs of the activity are relevant and timely; however, incident reporting (output 2.5 ‘Analyse and report  on incidents as required by Article 5(6) of the CSA on incident reporting’) was transferred to Activity 8 in the 2022  SPD to reinforce synergies with the outputs on foresight.  The four outputs of the activity will require additional rescoping to meet the needs of NISD2 and upcoming sectoral  regulations, and the work related to telecommunications should be merged into a single output. In addition,  sectoral work could be decoupled from the horizontal NISD implementation work to allow for greater focus. The  relevance and importance of vulnerability disclosure policies should also be examined in the coming years.  The existing KPIs are valid and relevant, and should be reviewed in the coming years.  Objectives  •  Align horizontal cybersecurity policies with  sectoral polices to avoid inconsistencies  in implementation  •  Contribute to the efficient and effective monitoring  of the implementation of EU cybersecurity policy  in Member States  •  Contribute to the effective implementation  of cybersecurity policy across the EU and  approximation of Member State laws,  regulations and administrative provisions  related to cybersecurity  •  Improve cybersecurity practices taking on board  lesson learned from incident reports  Link to strategic objective  (ENISA strategy)  •  Cybersecurity as an integral part of EU policies  •  Empowered and engaged communities across  the cybersecurity ecosystem  26  Outputs  2.1.  Support the NIS  Cooperation Group and  sectoral work streams in  accordance with the NIS  CG work programme  2.2.  Support Member States  and the European  Commission in the  implementation of the 5G  security toolbox and its  individual actions  Outcome  •  ENISA continued supporting the work of the NIS CG work  streams, promoting dialogue on supply chain security and  relevant security measures.  •  ENISA supported cross-border collaboration on incidents  experienced by digital service providers by piloting the ENISA  Cybersecurity Incident Reporting and Analysis tool.  •  The Agency analysed data and developed energy threat reports  every two months.  •  ENISA developed and organised sessions on cybersecurity topics for  the energy sector.  •  ENISA developed Member State guidelines on security measures  for top-level domain registry operators.  •  The Agency took stock, analysed data and drafted reports on security  measures and incident reporting for the health sector.  •  ENISA assisted with the organisation of events and carried out  out technical analysis in support of the work streams.  •  The Agency researched the security and privacy of public DNS  resolvers, providing insights into the effects of the use of encrypted  DNS protocols and into drivers for the shift away from traditional  DNS resolvers (https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/security- and-privacy-for-public-dns-resolvers).  The output achieved its objectives in 2021. Based on lessons learned, it  is proposed that the scope of this output should change to focus only  on horizontal matters of the implementation of the NISD and NISD2.  The sectoral policy implementation part should thus be part of a new,  dedicated output.  •  ENISA continued supporting the 5G toolbox by producing  a prototype version of the ‘5G Security Controls Matrix’ including  detailed security controls, descriptions of evidence and standard  references. The implementation is supported by a pilot run with  national regulatory authorities and mobile network operators.  •  ENISA explored the security challenges of network function  virtualisation in 5G networks and identified relevant best practices  (https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/nfv-security-in-5g- challenges-and-best-practices).  Results  •  Consistent implementation of EU policy and law in the area of cybersecurity  •  EU cybersecurity policy implementation reflecting sectoral specificities and needs  •  Exchange of good practice  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/security-and-privacy-for-public-dns-resolvers https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/security-and-privacy-for-public-dns-resolvers https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/nfv-security-in-5g-challenges-and-best-practices https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/nfv-security-in-5g-challenges-and-best-practices  ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2021 27  PART I. Achievements of the year  2.3.  Recommendations,  technical guidelines and  other activities to assist  with and support the  implementation of policies  within the NISD sectors,  in the area of trust  services and electronic  identification, under  the European Electronic  Communications Code  and its implementing acts,  and in the field of privacy  and data protection and  artificial intelligence  •  The Agency supported Member States on 5G security by organising  two 5G security knowledge-building seminars for the NIS CG.  •  The Agency explored the security challenges and benefits of  O-RAN, analysing technical risk scenarios and providing concrete  recommendations for updates to the Member States’ analysis.  •  ENISA supported DG Connect in reviewing the progress made in  each Member State in relation to the 5G toolbox implementation,  while providing suggestions on improving the questionnaire.  The output achieved its objectives in 2021. Based on the lessons learned,  it is proposed that the output should merge with the part of output 2.3  that deals with the European Electronic Communications Code to  constitute a single integrated output on telecom security and 5G.  •  ENISA continued the collection and analysis of data on a capability  maturity framework for the EU energy sector, providing useful  insights for the participants in the study.  •  ENISA supported port operators in conducting cyberrisk  management by publishing an online tool that helps them identify  security measures more easily based on their priorities.  •  In close collaboration with ERA, ENISA proposed a number of good  practices to follow to identify and manage the cyberrisk in the  railway sector (https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/railway- cybersecurity-good-practices-in-cyber-risk-management).  •  ENISA and ERA joined forces and organised a conference on  cybersecurity in railways.  •  ENISA organised the first ENISA Telecom Security Forum, bringing  together stakeholders from public and private sectors to debate on  emerging issues related to telecom security across Europe.  •  ENISA continued supporting the work of the European Competent  Authorities for Security of Electronic Communications (ECASEC)  Group of telecom security authorities. The group had three plenary  meetings during 2021 and participated in webinars on mobile  network security topics organised by ENISA.  •  In collaboration with the ECASEC Group, ENISA analysed fraudulent  SIM swapping, giving an overview of how SIM-swapping attacks work,  the frequency and impact of these attacks in Europe, and a set of  good practices to mitigate them.  •  The Agency supported the ECASEC Group in exploring consumer  outreach concerning cybersecurity threats telecom providers,  providing an overview of the current practices in relation to how  providers notify users of threats, and a framework to help assess the  necessity to carry out such outreach activities.  •  In collaboration with the ECASEC Group, ENISA analysed security  incidents affecting confidentiality, integrity and authenticity in public  electronic communications networks, focusing on those attacks that  target individual subscribers.  •  ENISA continued supporting technical aspects of implementing the  general data protection regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679) and  worked on analysing data protection engineering technologies and  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/railway-cybersecurity-good-practices-in-cyber-risk-management https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/railway-cybersecurity-good-practices-in-cyber-risk-management  28  2.4.  Assist in establishing and  implementing vulnerability  disclosure policies  techniques in addition to promoting pseudonymisation techniques  in the healthcare sector (https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/ data-protection-engineering, https://www.enisa.europa.eu/ publications/deploying-pseudonymisation-techniques).  •  ENISA co-organised with DG Connect the 9th Annual Privacy Forum  and hosted discussions on emerging legislative portfolios, including  the ePrivacy regulation proposal. In parallel, ENISA pursued an active  collaboration with the European Data Protection Board and the EDPS.  •  ENISA continued supporting the European Commission and Member  States in providing recommendations and technical guidelines  in the area of trust services and electronic identification. The  emerging topic of digital identification was the focus of two new  reports: an analysis of self-sovereign identity and a study of major  face presentation attacks (https://www.enisa.europa.eu/news/ enisa-news/beware-of-digital-id-attacks-your-face-can-be-spoofed).  Moreover, a workshop on ‘Remote identity proofing: attacks and  countermeasures’ was organised.  •  In collaboration with the European Commission, ENISA organised the  7th Trust Services Forum and hosted discussions on emerging topics  such as digital wallets; certification and standardisation in EU digital  identities; and the trust services market.  •  ENISA continued supporting the work of the ENISA Article 19 EG of  eIDAS supervisory bodies, holding three virtual meetings, a workshop  on blockchain security and a training course on cloud security.  •  ENISA supported the European Commission on the toolbox process  for a coordinated approach towards a European digital identity  framework and contributed to the security analysis of digital wallets.  The output achieved its objectives in 2021. Based on the lessons  learned, it is proposed that the scope of this output should not include  the EECC but rather the EECC should be merged with output 2.2 (see  assessment above).  •  ENISA took stock of the national coordinated vulnerability disclosure  (CVD) policies in the EU, publishing a detailed map of the different  policies in the EU, and providing an overview of risks, challenges and  good practices for the development of CVD policies.  •  ENISA supported the exchange of good practices between Member  States by organising a workshop for authorities about coordinated  vulnerability disclosure policies and initiatives.  The output achieved its objectives in 2021. Based on the lessons  learned, its scope should exclude the EU CVD database, which should  be part of Activity 4.  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/data-protection-engineering https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/data-protection-engineering https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/deploying-pseudonymisation-techniques https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/deploying-pseudonymisation-techniques https://www.enisa.europa.eu/news/enisa-news/beware-of-digital-id-attacks-your-face-can-be-spoofed https://www.enisa.europa.eu/news/enisa-news/beware-of-digital-id-attacks-your-face-can-be-spoofed  ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2021 29  PART I. Achievements of the year  Key performance indicators Contribution to policy implementation and  implementation monitoring at EU and national  levels (ex-post)  Unit of  measure-  ment  Frequency Data source Results  2.1.  Number of EU policies and regulations  implemented at national level supported  by ENISA  Number Annual Manual collection from  staff members  5  NISD Number Annual Manual collection from  staff members  1  EECC Number Annual Manual collection from  staff members  1  eIDAS Number Annual Manual collection from  staff members  1  5G Number Annual Manual collection from  staff members  1  Network CODE on cyber security (NCCS).

The output achieved its objectives in 2021. Based on the lessons learned,  during 2021 this output was moved to Activity 8 in the 2022 SPD.  2.5.  Analyse and report on  incidents as required by  Article 5(6) of the CSA  N/A, not applicable.  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/trust-services-security-incident-2020-annual-report https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/trust-services-security-incident-2020-annual-report https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/telecom-annual-incident-reporting-2020 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/telecom-annual-incident-reporting-2020  30  ACTIVITY 3 Building capacity  In 2021, ENISA contributed to the improvement of the capabilities of Member States and EUIBAs,  as well as various sectors.  Achievements The Agency assisted Member States in measuring the maturity level of national cybersecurity strategies (NCSSs)  through the deployment of an online tool that was developed with contributions from 20 Member States and  is already being considered for use by six Member States. This has provided the basis for the creation of the  cybersecurity index quantitative KPIs.  In parallel, significant effort was devoted to the preparation of the new strategy for exercises and training as  a result of the CSA. In this context, the preparatory work was carried out for the required switch to the new Cyber  Exercise Platform, which is better suited to supporting the objectives set in the new strategy.  In 2021, ENISA was confronted with the challenges brought about by the pandemic, which affected capacity- building activities at multiple levels. On the one hand, a number of courses and exercises had to be converted for  online delivery, for obvious reasons. This change posed a number of challenges, since the conversion of a course  or exercise to an online medium required rethinking and remodelling the material for delivery.  The Agency organised the European Cyber Security Challenge (ECSC) 2021 final, a competition that was widely  acknowledged as the best so far since 2016. We are now confident that the ECSC goal of attracting participation  from all EU Member States and European Free Trade Association (EFTA) countries will be reached in the next  two or three years. In this context, the process of setting the goals of the ECSC five years from now has already  started. This includes features such as expanding participation by admitting accession candidate countries and  teams from outside Europe that participate in the competition but are not part of the score board. Moreover, the  competition content will be further enhanced through the inclusion of defence against attack, social engineering  challenges, etc. Lessons learned in 2021 from both the ECSC and the International Cybersecurity Challenge (ICC)  (in 2021, under Activity 9) provided valuable contributions for the future.  ENISA developed a methodology for assessing the potential interoperability of risk management frameworks  and methodologies and supported with the identification of cybersecurity skills needs and gaps. In 2022 the  assessment of the methodology and the iterative process of improving it will take place.  Resources All activities were duly resourced, and the budget allocated to them was used as planned. The carry-over amount  in Activity 3 mainly relates to the postponement of two big events from 2021 to 2022, namely the Cyber Europe  Exercise and the ICC, due to the ongoing pandemic. In terms of HR, all activities were also duly resourced. The  slight deviation in the actual FTEs consumed had to do with delays encountered in recruitment, which were  compensated for by the existing team. The experience of 2021 is the main driver of budget estimates for 2024  onwards. ENISA is therefore processing its own quantified approach along these lines.  Overall assessment Although 2021 was an important year for capacity-building activities, it also demonstrated the long road ahead  in terms of moving closer to achieving cutting-edge competences and capabilities in cybersecurity across the  EU – the Agency’s strategic multiannual objective to which the activity contributes. As shown in the evaluation  of KPIs of the activity, important gaps persist in terms of both ensuring the maturity of Member States’ national  strategies (the Member States that participated self-assessed their maturity as low or medium, rather than high)  and ensuring that ENISA exercises and training deliver high levels of added value. Although there is currently  no overall understanding of the level of capabilities across the Union – a situation that should change after the  ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2021 31  PART I. Achievements of the year  pilot cybersecurity index has been conducted in 2022 – evaluation of indicators points to the need for increased  efforts and investments in capacity building.  Thus, it is important that for exercises and training one of the main priorities for 2021 was the development of the  new approach that takes into account the new conditions set by the CSA, which expands ENISA’s audience in terms  of capacity building with the addition of EU institutions and agencies. This work had to be carried out at the same  time as the Agency had to continue to provide its services to Member States. The direction set by the Management  Board during its strategic discussion in March 2022 points to a clear way forward to consolidate ENISA exercises  and training and focus them on specific stakeholders while putting more emphasis on linking specific training  and exercise events with better-defined medium- and long-term goals for building capacity. Secondly, the Agency  needs to step up and strengthen its support to Member States in terms of helping them to develop and maintain  comprehensive and effective national strategic frameworks that underpin national capacity-building.  Objectives  •  Increase the level of preparedness of and  cooperation within and between Member States  and sectors, and EUIBAs  •  Prepare and test capabilities to respond to  cybersecurity incidents  •  Foster interoperable European risk  management, consistent methodology  and risk assessment practices  •  Increase skill sets and align  cybersecurity competences  •  Increase the supply of skilled professionals  to meet market demand, including supporting  the necessary educational structures  Link to strategic objective  (ENISA strategy)  •  Cutting-edge competences and capabilities  in cybersecurity across the EU  •  Empowered and engaged communities across  the cybersecurity ecosystem  Results  •  Enhanced capabilities across the community  •  Increased cooperation between communities  Outputs  3.1.  Assist Member States  to develop national  cybersecurity strategies  Outcome  •  ENISA developed an online tool to accompany the national  cybersecurity assessment framework in order to help Member States  perform a self-assessment exercise meant to improve national  cybersecurity capabilities (https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/national- cyber-security-strategies/national-cyber-security-strategies-guidelines- tools/national-cybersecurity-assessment-framework-ncaf-tool#/).  •  ENISA produced a study on good practices on citizens’ awareness  of cybersecurity (https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/raising- awareness-of-cybersecurity).  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/national-cyber-security-strategies/national-cyber-security-strategies-guidelines-tools/national-cybersecurity-assessment-framework-ncaf-tool#/ https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/national-cyber-security-strategies/national-cyber-security-strategies-guidelines-tools/national-cybersecurity-assessment-framework-ncaf-tool#/ https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/national-cyber-security-strategies/national-cyber-security-strategies-guidelines-tools/national-cybersecurity-assessment-framework-ncaf-tool#/ https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/raising-awareness-of-cybersecurity https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/raising-awareness-of-cybersecurity  32  3.2.  Organise large-scale  biannual exercises  and sectoral exercises  (including Cyber Europe,  Blueprint Operational  Level Exercise (Blue OLEx),  CyberSOPEx)  •  ENISA organised the annual NCSS workshop, which took place  online (https://www.enisa.europa.eu/events/9th-enisa-national- cybersecurity-strategies-workshop).  In the area of NCSSs, all objectives were met in 2021. For 2022, the aim  is to develop a good practices framework (expanding on the work of  the national cybersecurity assessment framework tool) and to continue  the iterative process of reviewing/improving the NCSS map. From  2022 onwards, not only will the work continue in an iterative process  (namely, use of the tools – assessment of framework’s effectiveness –  improvement of framework) but we will further build on the links of  this activity to the cybersecurity index and info hub activities.  The Exercises Team of the Agency organised or co-organised the  following exercises during the reporting period.  •  CyberSOPEx 2021: testing the standard operating procedures  (SOPs) of the Computer Security Incident Response Teams (CSIRTs)  Network. This was organised and conducted by ENISA.  •  CySOPEx 2021: testing the SOPs of the CyCLONe Network. This was  co-organised and conducted by ENISA.  •  Blue OLEx 2021: testing the CyCLONe SOPs but with the main focus  on CyCLONe’s decision-making and internal communication at  executive level. This was co-organised and conducted by ENISA.  •  Cyber Crisis Coordination Exercise 2021 for the European  Commissioners’ cabinets. ENISA was involved in the scenario  preparation and supporting the execution.  •  EU Cyber Crisis Linking Exercise on Solidarity: preparations started in  2021, and the execution will take place in 2022. ENISA was part of the  core planners’ team, together with the National Cybersecurity Agency  of France (which was the main initiator) and the European External  Action Service (EEAS).  •  European Union Agency for the Operational Management of Large- Scale IT Systems in the Area of Freedom, Security and Justice (eu-LISA)  corporate information technology (IT) exercise 2021. The objective  of this was to validate the security policies and procedures of the  business continuity policies, business continuity plans and disaster  recovery plans applicable to corporate IT infrastructure. It also  intended to identify gaps in the coordination and communication  taking place among the different stakeholders concerned in the event  of a crisis. ENISA was involved in supporting the preparation of the  exercise and providing the Cyber Exercise Platform.  In addition, ENISA engaged in the preparatory work for Cyber Europe  2022 together with the Austrian planners. This included updating the  current Cyber Exercise Platform, to make it more secure and resilient,  and creating extra scenario options. It is also worth noting that the  pandemic forced a change in plan of the organisation of Cyber Europe in  order to take into account the shifting of the exercise from 2021 to 2022.  The two main achievements in this area (as well as for output 3.3 below)  in 2021 were the preparation of the new ENISA strategy on exercises,  and training courses meeting the requirements of the CSA. At the same  time, the Exercises Team also started the necessary preparatory work  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/events/9th-enisa-national-cybersecurity-strategies-workshop https://www.enisa.europa.eu/events/9th-enisa-national-cybersecurity-strategies-workshop  ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2021 33  PART I. Achievements of the year  3.3.  Organise training  and other activities to  support and develop the  maturity and skills of  CSIRTs (including NISD  sectoral CSIRTs) and other  communities  3.4.  Develop coordinated  and interoperable risk  management frameworks  for switching to the new Cyber Exercise Platform in 2022. This was  considered to be necessary because the platform currently used by  the team was reaching the end of its life. The preparations included  stocktaking of user requirements from the group of Member State  planners. In 2022–2023, the team will devote effort to informing  all relevant communities in accordance with the CSA) of the new  strategies on exercises and trainings. Moreover, in 2022 ENISA will  focus on implementing the provisions of the new strategies.  New e-learning material was developed on the topic of ransomware. It  involves the ATT&CK framework to help analysts understand and the  tactics, techniques and procedures of adversaries. The objective here  was to promote mitigation measures in order to ensure better protection  against similar threats. In-depth training courses and accompanying  tabletop exercises were delivered in 2021: the information security  management and information and communications technology (ICT)  security courses were held in two iterations each and had 59 participants  in total during the 5-day training. The cyber threat management course  had 16 participants completing the three days of training. ENISA  organised and conducted an interactive tabletop capacity-building activity  for representatives of EU Member States participating in the cooperation  group’s work stream 12 on the health sector.  In its cooperation with CERT-EU, ENISA’s objective was to provide  a state-of-the-art, relevant and cost-efficient training portfolio for  the benefit of both Member States and EUIBAs. A close operational  collaboration with CERT-EU and its other key stakeholders was  developed to this end and to support cybersecurity capacity building.  •  Report Interoperable EU Risk Management Framework. ENISA  published a methodology for assessing the potential interoperability  of risk management frameworks and methodologies, and presented  the results (https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/interoperable- eu-risk-management-framework).  •  Report Compendium of Risk Management Frameworks with  Potential Interoperability. This collection of identified frameworks  and methodologies includes well-known and widely used risk  management standards that provide high-level guidelines for  risk management processes that can be applied in all types  of organisations (https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/ compendium-of-risk-management-frameworks).  •  Workshop on interoperability of EU risk management frameworks.  The workshop was conducted as a means to present to stakeholders  the work done by ENISA in the field of risk management with a focus  on the interoperability of EU risk management frameworks.  The main achievement of 2021 in this area was the establishment  of the risk management framework. In 2022, the focus will now shift  to assessing its interoperability potential. The iterative process will be  completed by improving on the framework from 2023 onwards.  34  3.5.  Support the capacity- building activities of the  NIS CG and sectoral work  streams in accordance  with the NIS CG work  programme  3.6.  Support the  establishment,  development and  cooperation of European  information-sharing  schemes based on  ISACs, public–private  partnerships and other  existing mechanisms  •  Capacity-building activity for NIS CG work stream 12 (Health).  ENISA delivered an interactive tabletop capacity-building activity  that provides a safe environment among peers to increase the  overall competence of NIS authorities in addressing cybersecurity  in the health sector.  •  Roadmap for capacity-building activities for NIS CG work streams.  ENISA launched a survey to identify the needs of the NIS CG work  streams for capacity-building activities and accordingly to prioritise  future activities based on the needs identified. This work is closely  related to the work carried out under output 3.2. In this respect,  the work on training provided under this output is aligned with the  strategy on exercises and training developed under outputs 3.2  and 3.3.  This output, as is also the case for output 3.6, forms a specific use case  (for a specific user group) of the work developed under outputs 3.2 and  3.3. In this light, in 2022–2023, the team will devote effort to ensuring  (as was the case in 2021) that the work for this user group is fully aligned  with the new strategies on exercises and training. Moreover, in 2022,  ENISA will focus on implementing the provisions of the new strategies.  •  Report Cross-Sector Exercise Requirements for ISACs. This report  seeks to identify the skills, exercises and training needed to help  information exchange between ISACs (https://www.enisa.europa.eu/ publications/cross-sector-exercise-requirements).  •  Report Zoning and Conduits for Railways. The report is designed  to give guidance on building cybersecurity zones and conduits for  a railway system (https://www.enisa.europa.eu/news/building-cyber- secure-railway-infrastructure).  •  Supporting the European Commission with the ISACs Platform.  ENISA provided support to the project on developing new ISACs and  improving existing ones. The support involved participating in meetings  with the Commission and providing expert opinion on cybersecurity  architecture and the cybersecurity functions of the platform.  •  Supporting EU ISACs. ENISA continued its support to the various  EU ISACs. In the finance ISAC, ENISA organised two virtual meetings  and one physical meeting. In the energy ISAC, ENISA organised three  online webinars (operational technology cybersecurity, vulnerability  framework, and AI and operational technology and prepared an  annual ISAC threat landscape. In the maritime and health ISACs,  ENISA provided support in organising meetings and exchange  of good practices.  ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2021 35  PART I. Achievements of the year  The 7th edition of the European Cyber Security Challenge, ECSC 2021,  was hosted in Prague in October. The organiser of ECSC 2021 was the  Czech chapter of AFCEA.  In total, 300 people (contestants, coaches and judges) representing  20 EU and EFTA countries competed in the ECSC final in Prague, and  one country from outside Europe participated for the first time in the  competition as a guest (Canada). The finalists of ECSC 2021 were the  teams from Germany, Italy and Poland.  Furthermore, in view of its participation in the International  Cybersecurity Challenge (ICC), for the first time ENISA assembled  a European team during the reporting year. A total of 55 candidates  from 21 countries were preselected to potentially be part of the final  Team Europe that will participate in the finals in June 2022 (in Athens).  To support the selection process, two physical boot camps were held  in 2021 (in Tallinn and Turin) together with an online qualifier event.  It is also worth noting that the pandemic forced us to re-plan the  organisation of ICC in order to take into account the shifting of the final  from 2021 to 2022.  Despite the negative impact of the pandemic on the organisation  of large-scale physical meetings such as the ECSC, the final of 2021  was the best to date. The ECSC is the biggest competition of its  kind worldwide and established the blueprint that we used for the  organisation of the ICC. The latter will now become an integral part  of it. Moreover, the output will also include a training activity targeting  young talents who can participate in the ECSC and ICC (obviously linked  to output 3.3). In 2022–2023 and onwards, the emphasis of the ECSC  will be on setting the priorities and challenges for the next 5 years,  while that of the ICC will be on agreeing an established governance  structure for the future.  3.7.  Organise the European  Cyber Security Challenge  (ECSC)  3.8.  Report on cybersecurity  skill needs and  gaps, and support  skills development,  maintenance and  implementation (including  the Digital Education  Action Plan and a report  on higher education  programmes)  •  Report Addressing the EU cybersecurity skills shortage and gap  through higher education. ENISA contributed to providing an  overview of the current supply of cybersecurity skills in Europe  through an analysis of data gathered and generated by the recently  established Cybersecurity Higher Education Database  (https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/addressing-skills- shortage-and-gap-through-higher-education).  •  Maintenance of the Cybersecurity Higher Education Database  (CyberHEAD). It became the main point of reference for students  looking for a cybersecurity job. With more than 130 programmes,  it stands as the largest EU-validated source of information  for cybersecurity programmes  (https://www.enisa.europa.eu/cyberhead).  Already in the last few years significant steps have been made in  this area, addressing the cybersecurity skills shortage in the EU in  a systematic way. Through the development of the skills framework  and CyberHEAD, ENISA is making an important contribution in this  areas. In 2022–2023, ENISA will continue reviewing and improving the  framework in an iterative process while at the same time increasing  36  Key performance indicators Increased resilience against cybersecurity risks  and preparedness to respond to cyberincidents  Unit of  measure-  ment  Frequency Data source Results  3.1. Increase/decrease in maturity indicators  Maturity of national cybersecurity strategies  Number of Member States that rate the overall maturity of their cybersecurity strategy  High maturity Number Annual Survey 3  Medium maturity Number Annual Survey 4  Low maturity Number Annual Survey 3  Number of Member States planning to use ENISA framework to measure the maturity of their national  cybersecurity capabilities  Already using Number Annual Survey 1  Not using but planning to use Number Annual Survey 5  Don’t know or will not use in the foreseeable future Number Annual Survey 4  Number of Member States that have set KPIs to measure progress and effectiveness of the implementation of their  strategic objectives when drafting their NCSSs  Already using Number Annual Survey 3  Not set but planning to use Number Annual Survey 4  Don’t know or have not set KPIs currently  and will not set KPIs  Number Annual Survey 3  The frequency with which Member States update their strategies to adapt to technological advancements and new threats  Every 2–3 years Number Annual Survey 2  Every 4–5 years Number Annual Survey 6  More than 6 years or don’t know Number Annual Survey 2  Total maturity of ISACs (self-assessment) % Annual ISAC dashboard 63 %  ISAC A % Annual ISAC dashboard 60 %  ISAC B % Annual ISAC dashboard 56 %  ISAC C % Annual ISAC dashboard 90 %  ISAC D % Annual ISAC dashboard 50 %  ISAC F % Annual ISAC dashboard 63 %  3.2. Outreach, uptake and application of lessons learned from capability-building activities  CySOPEx 2021 (number of improvements  proposed by participants)  Number Per exercise 5  the number of academic institutes included in CyberHEAD.

The establishment of the Operational Cooperation Unit,  ENISA orchestrated the support envisioned as Secretariat of the CSIRTs Network (defined by NISD1) together with  the newly established CyCLONe (Cyber Crisis Liaison Network) launched in September 2020. This enabled ENISA  to synergise the support for these networks.  In relation to the CSIRTs Network, ENISA’s efforts went beyond the active support of daily operations in case  of incidents and brought the CSIRTs Network much forward in terms of operational cooperation. The Secretariat  facilitated for example with vendor outreach and supported the Network during extended alert periods relating  to high profile situations such as MS Exchange and Log4j. The Secretariat supported with ad-hoc reporting to  members and extended its’ operational support beyond working hours and holidays, thus prompting the CSIRTs  Network members to engage actively, despite the COVID-19 pandemic situation. All these were achieved based  on the capacity of the Secretariat to go the extra mile for the benefit of the Network.  It was a milestone year for CyCLONe as it was the first full year of operation and the Secretariat used its existing  knowledge from the CSIRTs Network support to bring this newly established network rapidly up to speed in  terms of tools and procedures which resulted in 1011% more interactions compared to the Q4 2021. Thus  providing a solid basis for future interactions between the CyCLONe and the CSIRTs Network.  2021 was also the first year when the same exercise scenario was tested at both the technical and operational  levels in a series of exercises engaging all networks. For the technical level CyberSOPex tested the CSIRTs  Network readiness and was followed by other exercises designed at the operational level. CyCLONe was tested  for first time during the CySOPex 2021 exercise that was tailored for CyCLONe officers whilst 2021 BlueOlex  exercise was tailored for the high-level actors of national cybersecurity authorities. Moreover, under the  Slovenian Presidency, ENISA organised the first physical post pandemic meeting, the 15th CSIRTs Network  meeting and the first ever shared session with CyCLONe.  In addition to these activities and in cooperation with the European Commission and with the Slovenian  presidency, ENISA organised hybrid and virtual workshops to support the discussions around the Joint Cyber Unit  initiative: one workshop dedicated to the preparatory activities and two more workshops dedicated to situational  awareness of the EUIBAs and EU MSs respectively. These activities initialised the discussions on exploring the  potential of the JCU and initiated a better and closer cooperation between the EUIBAs in the field of operational  cooperation, more specifically in the area of situational awareness (linked to Activity 5).  ENISA also facilitated the operation and information exchange with infrastructure, tools and expertise. Support  activities included the development and maintenance of IT platforms (including MeliCERTes) and communication  channels, exchanges of best practices, guidance and advice regarding incident response.  For instance, for the  MeliCERTes project, activities continued on maintenance of the previous version of MeliCERTes. In addition to  this, a complete high-level architecture of the next version of the platform was created and presented to the  CSIRTs Network. In 2021, ENISA worked on the technical specifications for this new architecture and started  building it up. In particular, ENISA provided high-availability to these infrastructures and tools.  To support both  versions of MeliCERTes project, interoperability tests were carried out and witnessed by ENISA and funded by the  Connecting Europe Facility (CEF) Telecom Cybersecurity program.  In addition, activities were carried out to improve and update maturity frameworks of the EUIBAs and to support  cooperation between CSIRTs and Law Enforcement.  ENISA continued to work closely with other EUIBAs (European Union Institutions, Bodies and Agencies).  Based on the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) signed in 2018 between ENISA, EDA, Europol EC3  and CERT-EU, cooperation activities continued with annual activities. In addition, a new MoU was signed  with CERT-EU leveraging on structured collaboration in accordance with the Cybersecurity Act.  ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2021 39  PART I. Achievements of the year  Resources As mentioned above, 2021 activities were covered thanks to the ability of the unit staff members to be flexible  and go the extra mile. The Unit started the year without staff members in all the allocated posts. Without the  commitment of the unit staff members, that also supported the integration of the new colleagues and SNEs,  the agency would not have been able to support the extended escalated modes as in the case of MS exchange  and Log4j, or to deliver on the unplanned activities such as the one related to JCU initiative (published during  2021).  This resulted in a lot of strain on the limited staff members in the Unit.  It should be noted that at the time  of writing some additional SNEs have been foreseen for the unit in the coming year.  To be able to increase its’  capability to deliver upon Activity 4, both in terms of the Secretariat and as regards infrastructure and tools, the  Unit would require additional resources, also in view of the need to be able to function 24/7.  The Unit took over and manages several tools and platforms that require permanent availability. To ensure  continuation of services (for end of the year and the beginning of the next one) some of the services such as licences  and maintenance contracts were de-synchronized from the annual budgetary cycle. The unit is reviewing its budget  planning to better align service provisions to the financial/budgetary cycles, to reduce the amounts carry over,  however the adjustments will most likely only be noticeable as of 2023 due to existing provisions and contracts.  Overall assessment With the creation of the Operational Cooperation Unit, the baseline for operational cooperation in the EU in  a structured way was enabled thus further strengthening the CSIRTs Network, establishing the CyCLONe foothold  and initiating greater interaction with the EUIBAs. In order to reach the full potential of such cooperation and  further improve capabilities and enable effective incident response and crisis cooperation among Member States  and EU institutions, additional resources will need to be allocated to sustain the evolving threat landscape. The  unit already planned a re-structuring of the activity dedicated to operational cooperation in 2022. In the 2022 SPD  similar activities such as management of tools and platforms were gathered under same output with the same  for activities involving common stakeholders. The process to find the best balance and the most efficient mode  of organisation will require assessment of the steps already planned for 2022.  This activity should also focus  on secure communication channels for the various operational communities that would require staff with the  necessary experience.  Objectives  •  Enhance and improve incident response  capabilities across the EU  •  Enable effective incident response and  cooperation among Member States and EU  institutions (including through the blueprint)  •  Improve the maturity and capacities of operational  communities (including the CSIRTs Network  and CyCLONe)  Link to strategic objective  (ENISA strategy)  •  Effective cooperation among operational  actors within the EU should massive cyber  incidents arise  •  Empowered and engaged communities across  the cybersecurity ecosystem  Results  •  All communities (EU institutions and Member States) use a rationalised set of SOPs  •  An agreed CSIRTs Network approach to selecting, operating and decommissioning tools  •  Coherent SOPs for cybercrisis management  •  Efficient framework, tools and methodologies for effective cybercrisis management  40  Outputs  4.1.  Support the functioning  and operations of the  CSIRTs Network (including  through MeliCERTes) and  CyCLONe, and cybercrisis  management in the EU  Outcome  CSIRTs Network-related activities  ENISA, as secretariat of the CSIRTs Network, supported all the aspects  related to the functioning of the network, including hosting a variety  of tools for the purposes of communication, operational effectiveness,  collaboration and information sharing.  Under the 2021 Portuguese Presidency, ENISA organised the 13th and  14th CSIRTs Network meetings, including a shared session with the NIS  CG. Under the Slovenian Presidency, ENISA organised the first physical  post-pandemic meeting, the 15th CSIRTs Network meeting which was  the first ever shared session with CyCLONe.  In line with NISD requirements, ENISA supported the drafting of  the third report to the Cooperation Group and, parallel to the  ordinary functioning of the CSIRTS Network, ENISA also supported  the operational cooperation among all CSIRTs Network members  during all the high-profile incidents that required escalation and,  among other outcomes, resulted in public statements on the Microsoft  Exchange (https://www.enisa.europa.eu/news/enisa-news/statement- on-microsoft-exchange-vulnerabilities) and Log4j (https://www.enisa. europa.eu/news/enisa-news/log4j-vulnerability-update-from-the- csirts-network) vulnerabilities, and in the establishment of the CSIRTs  Network GitHub (https://github.com/enisaeu/CNW).  ENISA organised CyberSOPEx in October 2021, in order to further test the  readiness of the CSIRTs Network for large-scale cross-border incidents,  and the same scenario was also used in the CyCLONe exercises.  Studies dedicated to specific tools and training material were produced  for the purpose of improved cooperation and collaboration between  Member States and EUIBAs as well as between CSIRTs and LE  (https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/2021-report-on-csirt-law- enforcement-cooperation).  ENISA published an updated handbook (https://www.enisa. europa.eu/publications/aspects-of-cooperation-between-csirts- and-le-handbook-2021) and toolset (https://www.enisa.europa. eu/publications/aspects-of-cooperation-between-csirts-and-le- toolset-2021) on Aspects of Cooperation between CSIRTs and LE.  Two training sessions were organised in August and in October 2021  to pilot the ENISA training material on CSIRT–LE cooperation.  The10th ENISA–EC3 Workshop on CSIRT–LE Cooperation took place on  19 October 2021 and brought together the CSIRTs and LE communities  from EU Member States and EFTA countries.  Furthermore, together with the CSIRTs Network, ENISA updated and  improved the CSIRTs maturity framework (https://www.enisa.europa. eu/publications/enisa-csirt-maturity-framework). ENISA coordinated  with EUIBAs to draft the first maturity model for the EU’s cybercrisis  management. The model was made available to the EUIBAs.  ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2021 41  PART I. Achievements of the year  CyCLONe Officers Network-related activities  The EU CyCLONe was launched in 2020. In 2021 ENISA focused on  further development of this new network by providing the secretariat  as well as the tools and support required to ensure the functioning and  interactions between the Member States.  Under the 2021 Portuguese Presidency, ENISA successfully organised  and coordinated all supporting activities for the 2nd and 3rd CyCLONe  Officers Meetings. Under the Slovenian Presidency, ENISA supported  the CyCLONe Chair and Members and successfully organised the  4th CyCLONe Officers Meeting and the first ever physical meeting  of CyCLONe officers, the 5th CyCLONe Officers Meeting, in a hybrid  form in Ljubljana, with a shared session with the CSIRTs Network that  resulted in a formal input to the JCU discussions.  This was also the first year that the same exercise scenario was tested  at technical and operational levels and it was the CyCLONe first ever  operational level through:  •  CySOPex 2021, the exercise tailored for the CyCLONe officers,  in May 2021;  •  Blue Olex 2021, the exercise tailored for the high-level members  of national cybersecurity authorities, in October 2021.  ENISA carried out several activities designed to improve information  sharing and operational cooperation, in particular regarding  automated reporting, impact assessment and situational awareness,  using the CyCLONe tools.  Joint Cyber Unit preparatory activities  In the context of the JCU initiative, in cooperation with the European  Commission and with the Slovenian Presidency, ENISA organised hybrid  or virtual workshops: one workshop dedicated to the preparatory  activities for the JCU, and two more workshops dedicated to situational  awareness in the EUIBAs and EU Member States respectively.  MeliCERTes project and tools  During 2021, ENISA maintained and applied patches to the Central  Service Platform based on the penetration test conducted by the  MeliCERTes consortium. In addition, the first-tier helpdesk continued  to be provided by ENISA.  Workshops in the CSIRTS Network tooling working group were  organised, so that the specifications for the Identity and Access  Management system could be defined. For this purpose, a comparative  analysis of several proofs of concept was conducted.  In addition, technical requirements for MeliCERTes 2 tools were  collected and the expectations for the recovery time objectives and  recovery point objectives were defined.  ENISA participated in several exercises for the business continuity  plan, and in the risk assessment of specific central services. ENISA also  proceeded with the procurement and installation of extra hardware  and software needed for the centrally hosted services of MeliCERTes.  In particular, ENISA set up the secondary site in Athens to host nodes  for the high available services of the MeliCERTes project.  42  4.2.  Activities to support  the development,  implementation and  evolution of MoUs  between ENISA, Europol,  CERT-EU and the EDA  In the context of the MoU, between ENISA, Europol, CERT-EU and the  European Defence Agency (EDA), these four organisations identified  areas of cooperation based on their common interest. During 2021, the  focus was on information exchange, education and training (including  cyberexercises), technical/operational cooperation and strategic matters.  ENISA acted as chair of the MoU during the reporting year. Several  deliverables were prepared.  •  ENISA developed and delivered to the MoU partners a collaboration  portal for the project management of the MoU roadmap to facilitate  interactions among MoU partners.  •  In the area of exercises, ENISA, EC3 and CERT-EU worked together on  the preparation of several cybercrisis exercises.  •  ENISA and EC3 organised high-level workshops bringing together  their respective communities i.e. CSIRTs and LE). During the  workshops, representatives from CSIRTs and LE discussed their  success stories and challenges related to their cooperation.  In March 2021, ENISA and CERT-EU agreed on a structured cooperation  on the basis of the provision of the CSA (Article 7.4) by signing an  MoU covering operational cooperation as well as capacity building,  knowledge and information. This new MoU was needed because of  the operational nature of the cooperation mandated by the CSA. The  activities for 2021 were agreed and planned in the annual cooperation  plan. As part of the efforts for further development of the Blueprint,  ENISA and CERT-EU aligned actions on developing EUIBA SOPs and  improving the Unions common situational awareness.  For 2022 this activity has been moved under the new re-defined  Output 4.1 in order to streamline the efforts and improve efficiency  when interacting with EUIBAs.  The first stable version of Cerebrate (https://github.com/cerebrate- project/cerebrate), an open-source platform meant to act as a trusted  contact information provider and interconnection orchestrator for other  security tools, was published. A pilot version was installed in ENISA.  ENISA also carried out activities for the development and maintenance  of the CSIRTs Network Portal.  With the creation of the Operational Cooperation Unit, the baseline  for operational cooperation in the EU in a structured way was  enabled thus further strengthening the CSIRTs Network, establishing  the CyCLONe foothold and initiating greater interaction with the  EUIBAs. In order to reach the full potential of such cooperation and  further improve capabilities and enable effective incident response  and crisis cooperation among Member States and EU institutions,  additional resources will need to be allocated to sustain the evolving  threat landscape  ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2021 43  PART I. Achievements of the year  4.3.  Develop SOPs,  procedures,  methodologies and  tools for cybercrisis  management  ENISA’s objectives for 2021 were to support the activities dedicated to  the cooperation of the operational actors within the Union in the event  of massive cyberattacks, and to empower and engage communities.  This work supports the implementation of the Blueprint for the EUIBAs  and was done in liaison with other EUIBAs.  Several deliverables were prepared in order to analyse the ecosystem  of cooperation. In particular, these reports covered a wide spectrum:  • an in-depth research analysis of SOPs;  • a set of comprehensive SOPs;  • an SOP survey of the EUIBAs;  • a set of guidelines for crisis communications.  ENISA also organised a working group of EUIBAs to exchange  information, and organised several bilateral and multilateral meetings  with the stakeholders to develop the SOPs and a plan for a 3-year  exercise programme.  Several steps were undertaken under this output such as crisis  communication. The goal of having EUIBA SOPs in place was not  achieved because of moving targets such as the JCU. In general, the work  under this output should focus more on supporting the task force / JCU.

The Agency fine-tuned  its’ weekly service (OSINT report) distributing information on relevant event to different stakeholder groups,  including CSIRT Network, CyCLONe, EUIBAs services, and Member State’s national authorities for critical sectors.  ENISA also actively supported the consolidation and exchange of information on strategic, tactical and technical  levels to operational communities, such as the CSIRTs Network and CyCLONe as well as relevant EUIBAs services  such as DG CONNECT, CERT-EU, Europol EC3, INTCEN, EEAS Security and Defence Policy - Cyber Security, and  EEAS Stratcom 2. In particular, as part of its structured cooperation with CERT-EU, ENISA piloted Joint Rapid  Report services. This product provides timely information to senior decision makers about on-going cyber events  and incidents and is expected to transition to production in the first half of 2022.  ENISA contributed to the incident response and cooperation among Member States and EU Institutions, Bodies  and Agencies during some of the major security events and situations, such as the supply chain attack against  SolarWinds and the exploitation of critical vulnerabilities, such as those linked to the Log4J 2.0 library, as well  as monitoring cyber events related to COVID-19 situation. ENISA ensures active cooperation among key national  and European stakeholders, which has led to joint guidance on vulnerabilities and threats. Furthermore, ENISA  provided support both in the area of (a) incident impact assessment, (b) facilitation of technical handling of the  incidents and (c) sharing relevant situation information with stakeholders.  The Agency increased its efficiency to generate and consolidate information, to assess incidents and to facilitate  handling in this way contributed to the EU priority on situational awareness by supporting the consolidation  and exchange of information on strategic, tactical and technical levels to operational communities. I doing do  the Agency leveraged its internal capabilities, such as its operational toolsets and actively incorporating lesson  learning in its operational response processes and after-action reviews.  In addition the Agency contributed to the initial scoping of the potential Joint Cyber Unit by way of a number  of workshops on common situational awareness. The Agency together with EUIBAs established a roadmap of  deliverable’s for the EUIBAs contribution to the Union situational awareness.  In line with its mandate, ENISA initiated actions to set up the framework to assist Member States on the basis  of Article 7 of CSA, as such a proposal was developed for cybersecurity assistance mechanism with services and  a pool of experts.  Resources The resources for this activity as well as the distribution of talents with the right skillset will need to be assessed to  meet expectations. Recognising the critical role of this activity led to the creation of the operations and situational  awareness sector, within the Operational Cooperation Unit, in order to enable the Unit to focus on these tasks  and to develop the appropriate strategy and plan resources accordingy.  The Operational Cooperation Unit set-up a crisis response team (CRT) mechanism with the aim at helping  the Unit and agency to respond to large-scale cross-border incidents and facilitate inter-agency coordination.  The mechanism was piloted for the first time to respond to the Log4j event that led to an after action report.  The capabilities and the working methods of the mechanism are planned to be refined in the course of 2022.  The cyber situational awareness will require more resources than the ones currently assigned to address the  evolving cybersecurity threat landscape. The achievements of this activity, given the limited resources, would  not have been achieved without the proactive attitude and enthusiasm of staff members. In addition, when  ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2021 45  PART I. Achievements of the year  the mechanism for cybersecurity assistance will be put in place, it will require additional resources to function,  regardless of the actual delivery method. It is not foreseen for ENISA to be the delivery party for assistance to  Member States on its own but by harnessing an external pool of experts to ensure scalability of the service.  As with Activity 4, the activity manages several tools and platforms that require permanent availability, therefore  ensure continuation of services (for the end of the year and the beginning of the next) the services contracted  such as licences and maintenance are not synchronized with the annual budgetary cycle, which is the reason  for the carryover of budget from one year to the next. The unit is reviewing its budget planning to better align  service provisions to the financial/budgetary cycles in order to reduce the amounts carried over, however the  adjustments will most likely be noticeable in 2023 due to existing provisions and contracts. Following the above  mentioned review of budget planning, as of 2022 several actions managing tools and platforms are gathered  under the same output to optimise the coordination.  Overall assessment In line with the Agency’s mandate the foundations have been prepared for contributing to the Union common  situational awareness as well for its operational capability to be able to respond to Member States requests in  case of large scale cross-border incidents and events. The formalised new sector within the unit will provide  the focus required in this activity and in particular around operations and situational awareness to address the  increase needs for information exchange.  This was also one of the leading themes of the initial work undertaken  for the potential joint cyber unit as well the need for the agency to be able to respond to external requests.  The objectives for 2021 have been achieved however to meet increased stakeholder expectations and additional  demand the acquisition of additional human resources with diverse skillset is needed in order for the Agency  to increase capacity.  Given this assessment focus for the following year will be on organising the resources and strategy for operations  and situational awareness and transitioning to a service-oriented approach. This might require a reduction in  scope in some areas, due to the need to reassess the use of the tools and budget commitment to scale the delivery  of its services and establish metrics that measure effectiveness and efficacy of the actions that seek to achieve  the objectives of the activity. Additionally, the unit will focus on increasing its collaboration and partnership with  Member States in synergy with Activity 4, build on the work done through the initial scoping of the potential JCU,  in particular with EUIBAs services, as well as focusing on building trusted partnerships with the private sector.  Objectives  •  Develop effective incident response and cooperation  among Member States and EU institutions, including  cooperation between technical and political actors  during incidents or crises  •  Establish a common awareness of cyberincidents  and crises across the EU  •  Facilitate information exchange and cooperation,  both cross-layer and cross-border, between  Member States and with EU institutions  Link to strategic objective  (ENISA strategy)  •  Effective operational cooperation within  the EU in case of massive cyberincidents  •  Empowered and engaged communities across  the cybersecurity ecosystem  Results  •  Member States and institutions cooperating effectively during large-scale cross-border incidents or crises  • Public informed on a regular basis of important cybersecurity developments  • Stakeholders aware of the current cybersecurity situation  46  Outputs  5.1.  Generate and consolidate  information (including  for the general public)  on cybersituational  awareness, technical  situational reports,  incident reports  and information on  threats, and support  the consolidation and  exchange of information  at strategic, tactical and  technical levels  Outcome  ENISA produced cybersituational awareness with a focus on  cyberincidents in the EU area but also across the world.  ENISA’s cybersituational awareness services were provided to EUIBAs  and authorities in Member States through regular weekly reports  (ENISA’s weekly open-source intelligence (OSINT) report) and ad hoc  threat research.  ENISA significantly increased the weekly OSINT report outreach to recipients,  with its OSINT reports now being sent to approximately 600 recipients.  In 2021, ENISA launched a new pilot product, the joint rapid report,  in close cooperation with CERT-EU.  In parallel, ENISA continued improving its tools (Open Cyber Situational  Awareness Machine) and delivered new ones (situational awareness  team toolbox) that will enable better data ingestion and increase the  production throughput.  ENISA’s data collection in this area also represents the main source of  information for ENISA’s long-standing threat landscape reports.  Main outcomes of the work:  • 49 weekly OSINT reports sent to 500–600 recipients;  •  37 executive summaries on healthcare (linked to the COVID-19  pandemic) sent to the European Commission;  •  16 ad hoc threat research papers shared with CERT-EU, DG Connect,  EEAS, EC3 and the general public;  •  20 joint rapid reports (including updates), done in cooperation with  CERT-EU, for senior stakeholders.  2021 was a foundational year for the agency’s situational awareness  capability. While, with limited resources, the Agency was able to fulfil to  its objective, however appetite for such capabilities have increased for  common situational awareness. As such the unit established a sector in the  last quarter of 2021 to focus on this capability and additional resources  planned in the course of 2022.  Going forward the unit will establish the service portfolio with supporting  tools and / or external services.  5.2.  Support technical and  operational cooperation,  incident response  coordination during  crises and activities with  the CSIRTs Network,  and CERT-EU, EC3, EEAS  and EDA EU-wide crisis  communication planning  ENISA made progress on actions to support effective incident response  and cooperation among Member States and EU institutions during  incidents or crisis. This was achieved by building on the survey  of Blueprint stakeholders and follow-up interviews with CSIRTs  Network members.  ENISA produced deliverables (restricted for the moment to the  CSIRTs Network members) on the mapping of secure communication  channels and a methodology proposal for evaluating channels. Several  supporting activities were carried out, such as support for the Crisis  Communications Management Guide (connected to output 4.3); input  to the EUIBAs SOP draft (connected to output 4.3); input to CSIRTs  ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2021 47  PART I. Achievements of the year  5.3.  Provide assistance and  support on the basis  of Article 7(4) and (7)  of the CSA  Network SOPs and support of the CSIRTs Network SOP working  group (connected to output 4.1); and support for the CSIRTS Network  communications channels check (connection to output 4.1).  To improve interactions with the stakeholders relevant to this activity, this  output was discontinued in the 2022 work programme, whilst the actions  continue across other outputs in the activity.    ENISA launched activities in order to set up the framework for the  assistance of Member States on the basis of Article 7 of CSA. Such  assistance (at the request of Member States) was meant to cover the  assessment of incidents and to facilitate the technical handling of  incidents or crises. A proposal for assistance was created, covering  a cybersecurity assistance mechanism associated with certain services  and a pool of experts. Within this output based on structured interviews  with Blueprint actors, ENISA produced the following deliverables  (available at the moment to CSIRTs Network members): guidelines;  processes and procedures; pool of experts’ structure. A pilot project was  carried out to test the operational activity of the assistance mechanism,  and involved testing the provision of assistance with limited scope for  three CSIRTs Network members. Results of the deliverables and lessons  learned from the pilot project will be used in the further development of  the assistance mechanism.  The actions carried out in 2021 set up the basis for a framework to provide  assistance and support according to Article 7 of CSA. The outcomes of these  actions will be used in organize the assistance mechanism with the aim to  provide assistance and support to Member States. The mechanism to be  implemented will require additional resources in order to asses, manage,  and evaluate both the requests and the technical services to be delivered.

More specifically, ENISA assisted the Commission on the governance of the framework,  promulgated three cybersecurity certification schemes with different maturity levels and prepared its  online services on certification.  Achievements By the end of 2021, ENISA had made meaningful contributions to the EU cybersecurity certification framework by  assisting the Commission with regard to discharging its duties concerning governance (European Cybersecurity  Certification Group (ECCG) and Stakeholders Cybersecurity Certification Group (SCCG)) and further processing  draft candidate cybersecurity certification schemes in terms of planning and content development. ENISA thus  served the strategic objective of a ‘high level of trust in secure digital solutions’ by reinforcing this aim with new  components of certification schemes, some of which have not yet been adopted and implemented by Member  States. Achievements include:  • the conclusion of the EU common criteria certification scheme with the opinion of the ECCG;  • the advancement of the EU cloud services certification scheme in a way that allows finalisation in early 2022;  • the launching of the ad hoc working group (AHWG) on the EU5G certification scheme;  • the kick-off of the ECCG subgroup on encryption;  • the conclusion of the Union rolling work programme at SCCG level;  •  advances in the design and implementation of the workflow and application programming interface for  certificate publication, as well as an analysis for a cybersecurity certification label.  Further enhancements to the certification approach led to adding guidance, pilots and methodological  components. The multiannual component of the Agency’s programming document provided further guidance  and the context for the overall pursuits of the year. During the reporting year, ENISA improved on its systems and  services by consolidating the use of collaboration tools of importance for the interactions with external experts.  To this end, it developed and implemented a web-based service for the Member States concerning certification.  Resources While all activities were duly resourced, the consumption of the budget allocated to cybersecurity certification  lagged because of a late decision in relation to the support and preparation for the 5G EU scheme. As a result,  the allocated resources were not consumed in full, since ENISA accommodated requirements tailored to  a multistakeholder environment where consultations and time constraints played a key role.  The main drivers for providing budget estimates in 2024 onwards will depend on the pace of implementation  of the Union rolling work programme on cybersecurity certification (i.e. production costs), the concentration of  actions to monitor adopted schemes (i.e. maintenance costs) and the transition to an online platform to meet  stakeholders’ requirements (i.e. community service costs). ENISA is therefore processing its own quantified  approach along these lines.  Appropriations carried forward served the purpose of bridging the multiannual cybersecurity certification work  from one year to the next, while serving the principle of annual budgets. The small amount carried forward does  not affect the ability of the unit to perform its tasks in 2022.  ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2021 49  PART I. Achievements of the year  Overall assessment Cybersecurity certification provides a focal point for the industry and, as the KPIs suggest, increasingly the  assistance and support stakeholders need including due guidance for the public authorities concerned, when  an adopted scheme becomes available in such a way that it can be implemented and further enforced. The  cybersecurity certification framework remained high on the stakeholders’ agenda during the reporting year,  as demonstrated by the robust support to and interest in ENISA activities as well as the results of KPI metrics.  Within the boundaries of its competence, ENISA’s timely response and coherent production of schemes and  related deliverables and outputs supported the cybersecurity certification framework.    Objectives  •  Trusted ICT products, services and processes  •  Increased use and uptake of European  cybersecurity certification  Link to strategic objective  (ENISA strategy)  •  High level of trust in secure digital solutions  •  Empowered and engaged communities across  the cybersecurity ecosystem  Results  • Support for schemes chosen to run under the European cybersecurity certification framework  •  Certified ICT products, services and processes preferred by consumers and, where relevant, OESs and DSPs   Outputs  6.1.  Draft candidate  cybersecurity certification  schemes and contribute  to the establishment  of the schemes  Outcome  ENISA worked in response to Commission requests for  cybersecurity certification schemes as follows.  EU5G.  •  In coordination with the European Commission, ENISA established  the AHWG to define the candidate EU5G scheme. The AHWG on  EU5G is formed of three preparatory work streams mapping the  request and seeking to leverage on a methodology meant to identify  certification gaps. While ENISA worked closely with public authorities  and the Commission in the preparation phase, kick-offs were  organised in Q4 2021 with over 100 participants involved (50 % from  public authorities and with broad private sector participation).  •  During the setting up of the AHWG, ENISA engaged with external  experts into the preparation of reference documentation for the  important activity of risk and gap analysis of work stream 3 of phase  1 of the scheme’s development. ENISA also carried out a pilot on the  newly defined methodology for sectoral cybersecurity assessments,  to validate its further use for the EU5G project  Cybersecurity certification conference  •  ENISA organised its annual cybersecurity conference in December  2021 in Athens. Keynote speakers and panellists discussed  cybersecurity certification including changes in the market, approach  to emerging technologies (AI, 5G), link with standardisation and the  impact on end user consumers. The conference attracted about  50  25 guest speakers, 50 attendees on site and over 1 200 attendees  online (1 800 registrations).  European cloud services  •  ENISA continued working on the request of the Commission for  an EUCS scheme. In Q1, a public review was launched with several  presentations to the public, followed by an analysis of the feedback.  •  The results of the survey led to revisions of the first draft candidate  scheme, and in particular of the part on requirements. Subsequently  these requirements were proposed to CEN-CENELEC Joint Technical  Committee 13 for the development of a technical specification.  Additional content was developed, in particular about extension  profiles and requirements for Conformity Assessment Bodies.  •  In Q3/Q4, EUCS prompted by the Member States, ENISA examined  aspects related to digital sovereignty and independence from non-EU  laws; currently a thematic group is seeking to consolidate an approach  to guidance received from the Member States and the ECCG.  Certification  •  In 2021, the Agency continued the same high pace of execution of  cybersecurity certification requests; as ENISA is gaining experience  and maturity, adding concurrent actions will probably take  precedence over a high frequency of actions.  •  Drafting candidate cybersecurity certification schemes and  contributing to the establishment of the schemes are essential  actions to underpin and develop the EU cybersecurity certification  framework; accordingly, this output can remain. Care needs to be  taken to dedicate resources to this output in such a way that they  reflect the actual level of execution of the Union’s rolling work  programme or equivalent request.  6.2.  Implementation and  maintenance of the  established schemes  including evaluation  of adopted schemes  and participation in  peer review  EUCC  • In relation to the Commission’s request for a cybersecurity  certification scheme on EUCC, the Agency supported the Commission  in prepare the first draft implementing act on the candidate EUCC,  which was discussed at the ECCG in June 2021, and it has remained  work in progress since then.  • During the reporting year, a guidance strategy on the EUCC  scheme was developed by the Agency with a view to supporting the  preparations for the implementation of EUCC and the transition  from SOG-IS certification to EUCC. In line with the prioritisation  foreseen by the ECCG, development of guidance on the following  started in 2021: accreditation, certification transition, taxonomy,  security of information and certification application forms. Pilots  were therefore resorted to for the validation of certain provisions  of the EUCC; this part of the work is still ongoing.  EUCS  • In EUCS, eight experiments were organised over the summer  to verify the feasibility of some of the new measures introduced  in the EUCS draft candidate scheme. Stakeholders from eight  Member States and from the United States were involved, including  ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2021 51  PART I. Achievements of the year  6.3.  Support statutory  bodies in discharging  their duties with respect  to governance roles  and tasks  cloud providers, Conformity Assessment Bodies and National  Cybersecurity Certification Authorities, and the results were used  to enhance the draft candidate scheme.  • Work was initiated on the development of guidance, in particular  around the new requirements on controls. This first phase of work  was focused on the format of the information required in the  guidance, and an initial version of the guidance was developed  across five categories, representing around 25 % of the overall  requirements of the EUCS.  Consequently, ENISA managed to be ahead of the planning in terms  of content regarding the EUCC; ENISA has been right on track with  EUCS and it launched the EU5G scheme, giving an overall picture of the  span of its involvement in relation to the EU cybersecurity certification  framework. It is also worth mentioning that ENISA further contributed  to early policy considerations of the European Digital Identity Wallet in  support of the Commission’s efforts.  In relation to the output on the implementation and maintenance of  the established schemes, including evaluation of adopted schemes  and participation in peer reviews, ENISA has taken a dynamic approach  and anticipated actions that facilitate the gradual implementation  of schemes. This output is essential for maintenance, which will be  the culmination of actions starting from the adoption of the first  scheme onwards. As such it needs to remain and be further supported  with commensurate resources that reflect the expected pace of  implementation of schemes adopted.  The European Cybersecurity Certification Group (ECCG)  • ENISA assisted the Commission in its efforts to operate the ECCG  and enable the ECCG to provide its views on the Union rolling  work programme.  • The Agency supported the Commission to set up an ECCG subgroup  on cryptography, on developing guidance on cryptographic  mechanisms to be embedded in ICT products and services,  and on developing related evaluation methodologies.  • Regarding the further development of the EUCS cybersecurity  certification scheme that started at the beginning of 2020,  a dedicated subgroup meeting was organised in March to allow  Member States to discuss and provide input to the Agency on the  mitigation of risks by security requirements related to independence  from non-EU law for EUCS, an element of the EUCS scheme that was  at an advanced stage at the end of 2021.  • Regarding the main projects related to the market, certification  and standardisation, regular updates were provided to the ECCG  to support the ECCG in its advisory role to the Commission and the  Agency on the EU cybersecurity certification framework and the  schemes under development.  The Stakeholder Cybersecurity Certification Group (SCCG)  • With support from ENISA, the SCCG assisted the Commission to draft  the Union rolling work programme, identifying the strategic priorities  for European cybersecurity certification schemes and future areas  52  for certification; consequently, the SCCG provided its opinion  in February 2021.  • ENISA assisted the SCCG and the Commission in defining the KPIs  and metrics for the future evaluation of the implementation phase  and the first of operational phase of the European cybersecurity  certification schemes.  • Regarding the main projects related to the market, certification  and standardisation, regular updates were provided to the SCCG  to support the SCCG in its advisory role to the Commission and the  Agency. In particular, they covered the developments on the EUCC  cybersecurity certification scheme for ICT products and the European  cybersecurity certification scheme for EUCS.  As this output serves the governance of the cybersecurity certification  framework and consumes no financial resources as such, it is required  that it stay as is. Small amounts of resources can be dedicated  indirectly in relation to output 6.1.  6.4.  Development and  maintenance of necessary  tools for an efficient and  effective EU cybersecurity  certification framework  (including a certification  website and collaboration  platform  ENISA website dedicated to certification  • With the support of selected Member States, ENISA further designed  and developed the IT system to support the requirement for  a website dedicated to the promotion of European cybersecurity  certification schemes, European cybersecurity certificates and EU  statements of conformity in accordance with Article 50 of the CSA,  as well as related information.  • The proposed approach includes a workflow and an application  programming interface to facilitate the distribution of objects that  ensured integrity and authentication.  Core Service Platform for EU Cybersecurity  Certification Stakeholders  • ENISA supported the European Commission to develop  and implement the Core Service Platform for EU Cybersecurity  Certification Stakeholders. The platform is part of the ‘support  for set-up of a cooperation mechanism for national cybersecurity  certification authorities envisaged by the Connecting Europe Facility  2019–2020 working programme and managed by the European  Commission. The activity started in October 2021 with three  workshops (one with ENISA, and the other two with the stakeholders  proposed by ENISA, who were from the SCCG, the ECCG and  the EUCC and EUCS AHWGs). ENISA provided the first use cases  for the basic layer of the platform.  Tools and a website are essential conditions for the success of  a cybersecurity certification framework. There is a need to reach  maturity and deliver the service in order to demonstrate the value  from the investment made and the engagement that stakeholders  have demonstrated in relation to this service. Looking beyond the  horizon, further resources will be necessary to further customise  and support the emerging technology platform when the Commission  makes it available to ENISA.

As the cybersecurity certification framework remains in its early stages, ENISA obtained  responses through a survey concerning the intention of the respondents to use a scheme. The responses are varied but should be  regarded as favourable on balance because a significant portion of the market views positively the prospect of an EU certification  scheme and intends to benefit from it when it becomes available. In the future, when a scheme is adopted and following user  education, the response rate is likely to change.  54  ACTIVITY 7 Supporting the European  cybersecurity market and industry  Under Activity 7, ENISA served the strategic objective of a ‘high level of trust in secure digital solutions’  by launching the cybersecurity market outputs; meaningfully associating standardisation and certification,  notably on 5G standardisation; analysing the prospective cybersecurity label; and reporting on  vulnerabilities for certified products, services and processes. As announced by European Commission  President von der Leyen in her State of the Union Address in September 2021, the Commission was to  proceed with an act to establish common cybersecurity rules for digital products and associated services  that are placed on the market across the European Union. ENISA contributed to this broader policy goal by  analysing the cybersecurity market of connected devices.  Achievements ENISA kicked off the cybersecurity market output in an effort to gain a meaningful role in a new analysis  and recommendations domain. ENISA reasserted its position in the area of standardisation with a newly  implemented approach to private standardisation organisations, and further collaboration with European  standardisation bodies; meaningful content was developed to mark gaps. ENISA also developed a concept for  a cybersecurity certification label, based on an analysis; it also launched a discussion forum that contributes to the  analysis of vulnerabilities for certified products, services and processes. While certification remained a background  theme across these outputs, ENISA sought to service other priorities of the Agency under Activity 7, notably risk  assessment, connected devices and cooperation with policy and awareness raising. Achievements include:  • a market analysis framework and implementation thereof on connected devices;  • reviews of risk assessment and 5G standards (including O-RAN);  • an analysis of cybersecurity labelling approaches;  • guidance on vulnerabilities of certified products, services and processes.  Resources With three outputs out of four being new, delivering on Activity 7 remained a challenge. Outputs 7.1 and 7.2  could potentially benefit from a reshuffle of in-house capacity to provide the resources needed in order to meet  the requirements.  Appropriations carried forward served the purpose of responding to policy priorities of the Commission and thus  the Agency in relation to the European Digital Identity Wallet; subsequently deliverables are expected in early  2022. A small amount was directed towards the annual standardisation conference that takes place in Q1, while  most arrangements are sorted out beforehand. The amount carried forward does not negatively affect the ability  of the unit to perform its tasks in 2022.  Overall assessment Under the CSA, Activity 7 can gradually grow, should cybersecurity market analysis start covering broader areas  and shift to a transversal service pattern. Standardisation has equally strong potential to delve into a dense set  of requirements and enhance the ability of the Agency to influence cybersecurity standards in fulfilling its role in  cybersecurity certification. Both these areas could benefit from a moderate increase in resources to better cope  with the growing demand of stakeholders for analytical market data and a flow of standardisation requirements  alike. Further adjustments concerning output 7.3 could allow best practices to be transversely analysed and  proposed to stakeholders across the market, certification and standardisation, and outreach policy areas  (e.g. the European cybersecurity index). With regard to output 7.4, which serves, inter alia, the purpose of  a discussion forum on its subject matter, no changes are proposed hereinafter, except for a modest adjustment  in resources, as appropriate.  ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2021 55  PART I. Achievements of the year  Objectives  •  Improve conditions for the functioning of the  internal market  •  Foster a robust European cybersecurity industry  and market  Link to strategic objective  (ENISA strategy)  •  High level of trust in secure digital solutions  •  Empowered and engaged communities across  the cybersecurity ecosystem  Results  •  Where relevant, contributions towards a more competitive European cybersecurity industry, small  and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and start-ups  Outputs  7.1.  Market analysis of the  main trends in the  cybersecurity market  on both the demand  and the supply sides  Outcome  ENISA initiated its activities in analysing the cybersecurity market,  with the aim of contributing to a more targeted, market-driven  decision-making process for the conception, launching and  maintenance of cybersecurity products, services and processes within  the EU. The Agency developed the ENISA cybersecurity market analysis  framework, which describes how EU cybersecurity market analyses  can be performed, and it has been introduced as a building block to be  gradually developed further.  • ENISA carried out an analysis of the supply of and demand for  internet of things (IoT) cybersecurity in distribution grids, and made  detailed suggestions on how this market might further evolve,  as a proof of concept.  • During the reporting year, the Agency also established the AHWG  on the EU cybersecurity market, which is supporting ENISA in  analysing market trends and segments, with a focus on cybersecurity  solutions to meet the dynamic market needs of stakeholders: ENISA  Cybersecurity Market Analysis Framework (ECSMAF)  (https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/enisa-cybersecurity- market-analysis-framework-ecsmaf); EU Cybersecurity Market  Analysis – IoT in Distribution Grids (https://www.enisa.europa.eu/ publications/eu-cybersecurity-market-analysis-iot-in-distribution- grid); call for the establishing of the AHWG on the EU cybersecurity  market (https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/standards/adhoc_wg_ calls/ad-hoc-working-group-on-cybersecurity-market).  The market analysis output has the potential to become a flagship  activity and the centre of gravity of a range of analyses, data feeds  and stakeholders’ involvement, across a range of target market areas.  The market analysis framework, slightly revisited, could remain the  centrepiece, while focus would shift across focal areas. A small but  focused range of services could be developed thereafter. An annual  conference could bring stakeholders together in a flexible arrangement.  56  7.2.  Monitoring developments  in related areas of  standardisation, analysis  of gaps in standardisation  and establishment and  take-up of European and  international standards  for risk management  ENISA also endeavoured to fulfil its tasks on standardisation as follows.  • It developed a rapport with European standardisation organisations  / standards development organisations / private initiatives. ENISA  implemented the tasks stemming from its standardisation strategy,  in particular through activities whereby ENISA acts as an agent  influencing standardisation and as a collaborating partner to the  standards development organisations and initiatives. Concrete  action consisted in launching or tightening relations with relevant  technical committees of standardisation bodies (European  Telecommunications Standards Institute technical committees on  cybersecurity and on electronic signatures and infrastructures; CEN- CENELEC Joint Technical Committee 13; International Organization  for Standardization (ISO) / International Electrotechnical Commission  subcommittee 27; International Digital Cooperation project on ICT  standardisation), and with private initiatives (GSMA, 3rd Generation  Partnership Project, Global Platform), and organising in collaboration  with the European Telecommunications Standards Institute and  CEN-CENELEC the cybersecurity standardisation conference (over  2 400 registrations) and participation in others. The Agency was active  in the development of the rolling plan for ICT standardisation, and  the feasibility study of the future standards in support of the CSA,  and proposed to the standardisation community new work items for  specific standards supporting certification, which were accepted by  CEN-CENELEC Joint Technical Committee 13 (methodology sectoral  cybersecurity assessment; EUCS controls; accreditation criteria).  • Analysis of standardisation requirements – risk management.  ENISA drew up a coherent overview of published risk management  standards addressing aspects of risk management and subsequently  describing methodologies and tools that can be used to conform  with or implement them. Based on a comprehensive inventory  of standards in the area, the study provides guidance on their  availability and outlines possible gaps, proposing concrete activities  to close these gaps (https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/risk- management-standards).  • Analysis of standardisation requirements – 5G. The Agency prepared  a study on 5G standards, in parallel with the preparations for the  work on 5G certification scheme. The ambition of this report was  to outline the contribution of standardisation to the mitigation  of technical risks, and therefore to trust and resilience, in the 5G  ecosystem, understood as a multidimensional space encompassing  not only technological and functional domains, but also the related  technology life-cycle processes and stakeholders (https://www.enisa. europa.eu/publications/5g-cybersecurity-standards).  • The Agency produced a study on O-pen-RAN standardisation,  focusing on the specification development process in this area.  The study was initiated at the request of the Member States and  the Commission.  Standardisation has been a flagship activity and it is fortunate that  it has gradually been integrated with certification. Further fusion  between these two areas will certainly assist reaching better policy  outcomes and benefit the cybersecurity certification framework.  The annual conference serves as a stakeholder platform to pass key  messages about cooperation and content.  ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2021 57  PART I. Achievements of the year  7.3.  Guidelines and good  practices on cybersecurity  certification requirements  for ICT products, services  and processes  7.4.  Monitoring and  documenting the  dependencies and  vulnerabilities of ICT  products and services  In terms of labelling for EU cybersecurity certification, ENISA drew up  key requirements and consolidated experience from other similar  initiatives concerning cybersecurity labels. This stands as a first step  towards labelling for certified ICT products, services and processes.  Around 50 stakeholders supported a dedicated thematic group, and  this output was presented to and discussed by ENISA governing bodies  (ECCG, SCCG, national liaison officers (NLOs)).  At the ENISA 2021 cybersecurity certification conference, a panel  discussed current IoT labelling initiatives and monitoring developments  beyond the EU; views were also exchanged with the National Institute  of Standards and Technology.  While labelling is reaching a turning point, good practices have the  potential for dynamic growth across a range of areas. This adjusted  output, remains for this purpose.  In terms of vulnerabilities of certified ICT, ENISA assessed the impact  of certification on the handling of vulnerabilities, from the CVD process  and certification status points of view. A thematic group supported this  output, and it identified the complete set of requirements related to  vulnerability handling in the CSA, certification schemes (EUCC, EUCS),  NIS and relevant standards. Two scenarios were developed to analyse  the gaps between the different requirements and to define a roadmap.  The AHWGs’ joint session and the ENISA governing bodies (ECCG,  SCCG) had an opportunity to review and comment on this output.  While low key, this output remains topical in the market and  certification area; as it is fit for purpose, no changes are expected.  58  Key performance indicators Recognition of ENISA’s supporting role for  participants in the European cybersecurity  marketa  Unit of  measure-  ment  Frequency Data source Results  7.1. Number of market analyses, guidelines and good practices issued by ENISA  Cybersecurity market analysis framework Number Annual Reports 2  7.2. Uptake of lessons learned / recommendations from ENISA reports  Percentage of respondents interested in using  ENISA’s good practice on market analyses  % Annual Survey 87 % high and  medium interest  Percentage of respondents interested in using  ENISA’s standards mapping related to 5G  % Annual Survey 84 % high and  medium interest  Percentage of respondents interested in using  ENISA’s standards mapping related to the IoT  % Annual Survey 88 % high and  medium interest  Percentage of respondents interested in  using ENISA’s risk-based approach for their  cybersecurity certification activities  % Annual Survey 72 % high and  medium interest  Percentage of respondents interested  in using ENISA’s consolidated certification  labelling process  % Annual Survey 84 % high and  medium interest  Percentage of respondents interested in using  ENISA’s vulnerability management process for  certified products, services and processes  % Annual Survey 82 % high and  medium interest  7.3. Stakeholder satisfaction with the added  value and quality of ENISA’s work  % Biennial Survey N/A  Allocated FTEs as per  SPD based on full  establishment  at year-end 2021  9 Actual used FTEs 6.50  Planned budget  (direct costs only)  EUR 490 000 Consumed budget  (direct costs only)  EUR 450 894  Of which carried over to 2022 EUR 69 996  N/A, not applicable.  a The KPIs of Activity 7 allow the Agency to reaffirm its role and obtain feedback on its efforts to take a new standpoint on cybersecurity.  ENISA has built a long-standing relationship with stakeholders on cybersecurity standardisation, and the outcome permeates through  the results of the survey in terms of stakeholder value.  ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2021 59  PART I. Achievements of the year  60  ACTIVITY 8 Knowledge on emerging cybersecurity  challenges and opportunities  This activity intends to provide strategic long-term analysis, guidance and advice on the cybersecurity  threat landscape, emerging technologies and cybersecurity challenges. It also serves the purpose of providing  topic-specific recommendations and general assessments on the impact of cybersecurity’s requirements and  challenges. The activity also focuses on identifying and giving advice in relation to cybersecurity research and  innovation, and thus contributes to the relevant EU strategic agenda.  In line with the strategic objective of efficient and effective cybersecurity information and knowledge  management for Europe, the activity builds on aggregating and analysing information across the ecosystem  (legal, regulatory, technical, societal, etc.), and leverages expertise to provide relevant analyses. In doing so,  information from other activities (e.g. NIS investments under Activity 1, output 1.1, incident reporting under  Activity 2, output 2.5, and situational awareness under Activity 5, output 5.1) is consolidated under Activity 8  to promote relevant analyses and give recommendations. A prime example is the work on the cybersecurity  index that will pull information from across all activities in order to assess the level of cybersecurity maturity  of Member States. Moreover, the analyses and recommendations under Activity 8 feed into the work and  prioritisation of topics of other activities, with a notable example being the threat landscape that guides the  selection of topics for training and exercises (Activity 3). An effective cycle of information and knowledge  management is thus achieved by consolidating information across ENISA’s ecosystem of activities, analysing  them and feeding back to the activities of ENISA.  Achievements During the reporting period, ENISA worked on various fronts in terms of consolidating information, analysing it  and providing analyses and recommendations to serve stakeholders’ expectations. The Agency worked closely  with the stakeholders’ communities (one established and two new ad hoc working groups, as well as a subgroup  of the NLO Network).  ENISA has set the grounds and followed a multiannual perspective in the delivery of Activity 8, engaging in the  design of the EU cybersecurity index, the annual threat landscape and the supply chain attacks threat landscape,  the methodology on identifying foresight challenges, the design of the information hub (infohub), the work on AI  and securing machine learning. Besides, ENISA provided continuous support to the EU research and innovation  agenda, and in particular to the ECCC, by helping with the identification of research and innovation priorities. All  those projects have long-term plans and adhere to a service-oriented approach to cater for stakeholders’ needs  in an agile manner.  In terms of cohesion and vision, the work of Activity 8 looks at cybersecurity information and knowledge across  the timeline, by looking into past and present data (threat landscapes and cybersecurity index) to understand the  status quo and identify trends for the future (foreseen and emerging challenges), and use these to feed into the  research and development agenda (research and innovation priorities), with the aim of raising awareness using  a procedural knowledge management framework (infohub). The multiannual perspective followed in Activity 8  (with works on foresight, the cybersecurity index and the infohub in particular), having a 3-year time horizon, was  necessary to allow a level of maturity to be attained internally. These particular works were new to ENISA and in  this respect – and to allow for synchronisation between the various pieces of work – adequate time was needed  to allow ENISA to build its capabilities, and to allow acceptance by the Agency’s stakeholders to grow steadily  and in a participatory manner. Both latter aspects of stakeholder engagement are deemed necessary for the  successful implementation of and buy-in to projects such as the cybersecurity index and the infohub.  Accordingly, targeted information and recommendations are provided to stakeholders at various levels and in  a timely fashion to support decision-making and ensure that a solid and future-proof view of cybersecurity is  taken into account. The timeliness of the information is an area that can be further improved, by moving towards  real-time mapping of the cybersecurity threat landscape, which would require additional efforts on the part of  ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2021 61  PART I. Achievements of the year  ENISA to continuously analyse and identify recommendations. Along these lines, the agency is working towards  consolidating information from output 2.5 (annual incident reporting) with other information sources, mostly  open-source, frequently used in the mapping of threat landscapes, and will streamline relevant efforts towards  the consolidation of information.  In identifying the complex nature of outputs under Activity 8 (e.g. output 8.1 addresses the cybersecurity index,  foresight and recommendations on future and emerging challenges), already in the 2022 SPD the Management  Board of ENISA undertook corrective actions to make the structure more lean and appropriate to satisfy its  strategic objectives. In addition, realising the opportunity for synergies with the work on incident reporting under  Activity 2 (output 2.5), already in 2022 this work will be considered under Activity 8 to promote cross-fertilisation  and integrated knowledge management concerning the threat landscape. More opportunities concerning the  streamlining of knowledge management exist, notably with the work on situational awareness under Activity  5, and the Agency is internally promoting closer ties between the two work streams by means of consolidated  tooling requirements and by exploring the potential of common analysis techniques.  Resources Budget implementation for Activity 8 reached 95 % at the end of the reporting year. Considering the impact  of the pandemic on the planning of physical events and travel expenses linked to business travel, this  implementation came as a very positive result for the Agency.  In terms of FTE resources, Activity 8 faced the challenge of having two horizontal teams, with team members  contributing various percentages towards the team and one operational unit working together to meet the  objectives.  The KPIs of Activity 8 are diverse in nature. KPI 8.1 deals with the visibility and impact of the infohub, which, given  its multiannual development plan, did not become operational during the reporting year. Therefore, KPI 8.1 was  not assessed in 2021, since only the design of the infohub and the knowledge management framework were  introduced in 2021. KPI 8.2 assesses the quantity and depth of ENISA’s work in terms of analyses, challenges and  recommendations. With an average of 36 analyses, challenges and recommendations identified in each of the  eight reports considered, the depth of ENISA’s work in identifying cybersecurity challenges, highlighting relevant  recommendations and providing analyses is considered significant. KPI 8.3 involves a biennial stakeholder  satisfaction survey, which will be held at the end of 2022.  Overall assessment Activity 8 met its objectives during the reporting year. KPIs revealed that ENISA had a notable impact  in identifying recommendations, analyses and challenges, and that it delivered the expected results.  However, the objective of increasing Member State and EU resilience and preparedness for handling future  cybersecurity challenges and opportunities remains difficult to assess. At this point in time, the Agency expects  the EU cybersecurity index to serve as a benchmark and to therefore help assess how this objective will  be met in the future. ENISA expects to analyse and process the results of the cybersecurity index, although  more resources will be required than those of 2021, in order to develop and maintain the index during the  coming years.  62  Objectives  •  Identify and understand future cybersecurity  challenges and opportunities, and assess the  interlinks between cybersecurity and relevant  disrupting technologies in the current and future  digital transformation  •  Increase the resilience and preparedness of  Member States’ and the EU’s in handling future  cybersecurity challenges and opportunities  •  Increase knowledge and information for  specialised cybersecurity communities  Link to strategic objective  (ENISA strategy)  •  Foresight on emerging and future  cybersecurity challenges  •  Efficient and effective cybersecurity information  and knowledge management for Europe  •  Empowered and engaged communities across  the cybersecurity ecosystem  Results  •  Decisions about cybersecurity are future-proof and take account of the trends, developments  and knowledge across the ecosystem  •  Stakeholders receive relevant and timely information for policymaking and decision-making  Outputs  8.1.  Identification, collection  and analysis of present  and emerging challenges  (e.g. technological,  economic or societal) in  cybersecurity (including  developing and  maintaining a European  Cybersecurity Index)  Outcome  • In 2021, ENISA commenced work on designing, developing and  maintaining a European Cybersecurity Index. A multi-annual plan  was launched, including the design and development, the piloting,  and eventually the deployment and maintenance of the index.  A dedicated subgroup of ENISA’s NLO Network was established  to continuously engage with the Member States.  • In 2021, ENISA worked together with Member States and delivered  the following internal reports and studies:  –  analysis of existing cybersecurity capabilities assessment  frameworks and indexes;  –  a set of EU cybersecurity indicators;  –  empirical validation of indicators and domains;  –  the EU Cybersecurity Index Framework version 1.0  (a ‘live’ document);  –  requirements for cybersecurity index supporting tools.  • Concerning analysis of present and emerging challenges, in  the course of 2021 ENISA worked on two topics, namely AI and  cryptology with a focus on post-quantum cryptography (PQC). To  this end, with the support of the ENISA ad hoc AI working group, the  Agency delivered a report on securing machine learning algorithms,  following up from the recommendations of the ENISA AI threat  landscape that was published in 2020. With regard to cryptology, the  Agency worked on the issue of post-quantum integration and crypto  assets, and relevant reports will be published in 2022.  ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2021 63  PART I. Achievements of the year  • In 2021, ENISA laid the foundations for foresight, namely to identify,  collect and analyse present and emerging challenges across various  dimensions (e.g. technological, economic or societal). To this end,  the Agency established an ad hoc working group on foresight for  emerging and future cybersecurity challenges.  • In 2021, ENISA worked with the Foresight Working Group and the  futures and foresight community to develop a methodological  process to apply foresight to cybersecurity. The result of this work  was published and will serve as guidance for the foresight efforts of  ENISA and other cybersecurity organisations in the future.  • Securing Machine Learning Algorithms (https://www.enisa.europa. eu/publications/securing-machine-learning-algorithms).  • Foresight Challenges (https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/ foresight-challenges).  Output 8.1 addresses the cybersecurity index, foresight and  recommendations on future and emerging challenges. Already in  the 2022 SPD the Management Board of ENISA undertook corrective  actions to make the structure leaner and more appropriate to satisfy its  strategic objectives. Accordingly, the work on the index will be part of  a dedicated output, and the work on foresight and emerging challenges  also has a dedicated output in the 2022 SPD.  8.2.  Provide targeted as  well as general reports,  recommendations,  analysis and other actions  in relation to future  cybersecurity scenarios  and threat landscapes  (incident response  landscape mapping for  NIS directive sectors)  During 2021, ENISA restructured the delivery of threat landscapes by  establishing an ad hoc working group on cyberthreat landscapes and  laying the groundwork for a transparent and public methodology.  By incorporating a plethora of cyberthreat intelligence sources and  following a service-oriented approach, the work on threat landscapes  increased in confidence.  • In 2021, the ENISA Annual Threat Landscape was published for the  ninth time and an additional thematic threat landscape on supply  chain attacks was also published:  –  ENISA Threat Landscape 2021 (https://www.enisa.europa.eu/ publications/enisa-threat-landscape-2021);  –  ENISA Threat Landscape for Supply Chain Attacks (https://www.enisa. europa.eu/publications/threat-landscape-for-supply-chain-attacks).  • Building on its work on supporting operational cooperation across  EU over recent years, in 2021 ENISA conducted a study on mapping  incident response capabilities and developments in a sector to which  the NISD dedicates attention, namely the healthcare sector. The  report provided practical recommendations on future developments  in incident response in the healthcare sector:  –  CSIRT Capabilities in Healthcare Sector (https://www.enisa.europa. eu/publications/csirt-capabilities-in-healthcare-sector).  The work on threat landscapes was highly appreciated by the  stakeholders and contributed greatly to the strategic objective of  efficient and effective knowledge management in Europe. Realising  the opportunity for synergies with the work on incident reporting  under Activity 2 (output 2.5) has already been integrated into Activity  8 during the 2022 work programme to promote cross-fertilisation and  integrated knowledge management concerning the threat landscape.  64  8.3.  Develop and maintain  a portal (information  hub), a one-stop shop  for organising and  making available to  the public information  on cybersecurity,  and establishment of  a procedural framework  to support knowledge  management activities  8.4.  Support EU research and  development programmes  and activities of European  competence centres,  including the four EU  pilot projects for the  European Cybersecurity  Competence Centre and  Network of National  Coordination Centres  ENISA opted for a multi-annual approach to deliver the infohub.  In 2021, the agency established an initial procedural framework to  support the knowledge management activities of a future infohub.  This included the development of relevant taxonomies, templates and  potential processes for knowledge acquisition and validation, setting  out the baseline procedures and processes that will be considered for  integration in the technical specifications upon which the development  of the prototype portal will be built.  Moreover, during 202 ENISA carried out the identification of leading  best practices among existing cybersecurity knowledge management  frameworks and information portals, with 81 individual knowledge  resources analysed. Based on lessons learned and the scoped leading- practice experience, inferred through surveys and interview sessions,  key potential components of the infohub’s structure have been  identified, feeding into the design of a procedural framework.  For the validation of the work and to increase acceptance, ENISA  engaged stakeholders from 13 Member States through one workshop,  three surveys and eight interviews. Moreover, NLOs and experts from  the European Cybersecurity Atlas were also engaged in this activity and  provided input and comments.  When it comes to the infohub (output 8.3), further efforts should  be pursued to better establish the ties between the infohub and  consolidated knowledge management and awareness-raising activities.  Such efforts would greatly contribute towards achieving the strategic  objective of empowered and engaged communities across the  cybersecurity ecosystem.  During 2021, ENISA consolidated and analysed the proposals and  recommendations of the four pilot projects and the European Cyber  Security Organisation, supporting the European Commission to  prepare input for future discussions on the ECCC strategic agenda.  In 2021, ENISA identified research and innovation needs and priorities  in the fields of life science, cryptography, AI and hyperconnectivity, with  the goal of preparing future funding priorities for the ECCC.  Efforts related to research and innovation under output 8.4 need to  be better streamlined to reflect the recent policy developments with  the establishment of the ECCC. In 2021, efforts on both research  and innovation priorities for the cybersecurity agenda of the EU and  support for the ECCC were bundled under one output, and corrective  actions were already taken in the 2022 SPD to split these into distinct  lines of work.

The activity also focuses on creating an international  position for ENISA in the cybersecurity ecosystem.  Overall, the concept of behavioural change towards cybersecurity requires persistent long-term  effort, well-defined objectives, an identified target group, and ultiamtely specific and relevant metrics  and indicators.  Achievements The deliverables of the team for 2021 were mostly internal, to create the stable foundation for all the awareness  activities the Agency will undertake in the coming years. Specifically, the team worked on:  •  the ENISA stakeholder strategy, a massive exercise of consolidating feedback and information from across all  ENISA units and teams, but also from external stakeholders, in a holistic inclusive framework;  •  the awareness-raising framework, a set of processes and requirements for organising an awareness-raising  campaign and programme, including all necessary steps to communicate the right messages;  •  the promotion and dissemination strategy, presenting the most effective means and channels to use for each  target audience and some advice on how to increase outreach to the community.  These documents were not published, as they are intended for internal use.  The outreach projects focusing on external stakeholders under this activity concern numerous large- and small- scale campaigns; more specifically:  •  the European Cybersecurity Month (ECSM), the flagship pan-European cybersecurity awareness campaign,  which increased its outreach;  •  the thematic campaigns on several cybersecurity topics (i.e. ransomware and certification; creating synergies;  and long-term objectives).  The multidisciplinary nature of the awareness-raising and education team helped create good and strong  collaboration points, and identified new synergies with the work of the other units.  Finally, to engage the stakeholder communities, under this activity the ad hoc working group on awareness  raising, composed of experts, was created as well as the enterprise security group focusing on SMEs. The terms  of reference for the ECSM coordinators group were drafted and approved by the group itself.  Resources Concerning resources, Activity 9 had a budget utilisation of 95 %, which is assessed as being positive given  the pandemic and the impact it had on the planning of physical events and travel expenses. In terms of FTE  resources, Activity 9 is challenged by the team’s specific nature, with colleagues coming from different units or  other teams and therefore not fully involved timewise. Even if such a team obviously presents opportunities  for synergies, it inevitably means lack of ownership of, commitment to and responsibility for the team projects.  With regard to carry-over of funds, certain outputs take place late in the year, so delivery of those projects took  place in 2022, and in other cases such as the ICC the entire project was postponed as a result of the COVID-19  pandemic. The ARET would benefit from more resources to support existing projects (heavily needed under the  OES campaigns to achieve the goal of behavioural change) but also to offload support provided by other sectors  of the Agency such as the communications sector. Approximately 30 % of the resources focused on internal  projects (including the international strategy).  ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2021 67  PART I. Achievements of the year  Overall assessment Overall, the outputs under this activity contributed into the strategic objective of empowered and engaged  communities, although at this stage it remains unclear to what extent the relevant communities are engaged  and empowered – a situation that should be clarified in the 2022 annual activity report, as the stakeholder  strategy implementation plan sets up a process to monitor and evaluate the actual engagement of stakeholder  groups under all activities in the annual activity report.  With regard to the current KPIs, they are all geared to measuring engagements during different awareness- raising campaigns, but that might not give a full picture of actual impact or added value, even if one compares  similar results in the coming years. Thus, the second KPI should be further refined to offer insights on the  effectiveness of ENISA projects at raising awareness, as the current proposal cannot derive conclusions on the  specific ENISA outputs.  A proposal for a new output under this activity is also put forward to combine all activities of the Agency that  relate to education, thus absorbing output 3.8 on the skills framework and also the task that will be created  under the cybersecurity educational roadmap.  Objectives  •  Elevate the understanding of cybersecurity risks  and practices across the EU and globally  •  Foster EU cybersecurity values and priorities  Link to strategic objective  (ENISA strategy)  •  Empowered and engaged communities across  the cybersecurity ecosystem  Results  •  Greater understanding of cybersecurity risks and practices  • Stronger European cybersecurity through higher global resilience  Outputs  9.1.  Develop an ENISA  stakeholder strategy and  undertake actions for its  implementation  Outcome  During 2021, under this output the team conducted two projects.  • The stakeholder strategy package, a set of documentation that includes  the stakeholder strategy (to be published), the implementation  guide, the management plan and the requirements for tooling. All  documents are to be used internally to support a structured approach  to stakeholder engagement and management in the Agency.  • The awareness-raising conceptual framework, the basis for future  ARET campaign development. The framework outlines the life cycle of  awareness campaigns and awareness-raising programmes, including  a detailed plan for evaluation. During the collection of project  feedback, stakeholders expressed great interest in seeing a public  version of the framework – view that is reflected in the 2022 SPD.  None of the documents is publicly available. A public version of the  ENISA stakeholder strategy will be published in 2022.  This output was replaced in the 2022 SPD with the task of seeking to  achieve behavioural change for OESs.  68  9.2.  Develop an ENISA  international strategy and  outreach activities  9.3.  Organise the ECSM  In February 2021, the ENISA task force for international cooperation  was set up and tasked with drafting the ENISA international strategy.  Based mainly on the input from the Member States, the strategy  was developed and adopted by the ENISA Management Board  in November 2021 (https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/ corporate-documents/enisa-international-strategy). The ENISA  international strategy covers cooperation with non-EU countries and  with international organisations. It sets out the principles governing  ENISA’s international cooperation, and sets out three different  approaches (limited, assisting and outreach) that the Agency can use  in terms of its level of engagement and commitment of resources.  In 2021, ENISA received several requests for international  cooperation and accommodated a number of them. For instance,  it provided assistance in the context of some cyber dialogues  with non-EU countries and contributed to international events  organised by the Council of Europe, such as the 2021 Octopus  Conference (https://www.coe.int/en/web/cybercrime/octopus-interfa ce-2021#{%22106157651%22:[10]}).  In 2021, ENISA laid the ground work international outreach activities by  formulating and publishing its first international cooperation strategy  through a cross-unit task force. In 2022, the international team (INT)  published the international strategy implementation guidelines and it is  working on creating synergies with the Agency’s operational units and  with Commission and EEAS services, and it has created a roadmap for the  Agency’s international partnerships. It will also release an annual report  on the Agency’s international cooperation as defined in the international  strategy. INT will continue to provide services to the Agency’s operational  units in 2022 and onwards, to fulfil its strategic intent.  The 9th edition of the ECSM saw great increase in outreach; for  the first time June was also included as a promotion month for the  ECSM activities, and the winning team of the ECSC announced the  ECSM’s inauguration and became ECSM ambassadors.  The campaign had two themes: Be Cyber Secure from Home (cyber  hygiene and good practices for online presence) and Cyber First  Aid (guidance when citizens are victims of cyberattacks). Twenty-six  Member States actively participated in the campaign, conducted  national campaigns and participated in the evaluation of the ECSM.  An interactive EU map was created in collaboration with the national  campaign coordinators, on which citizens can find what services are  available in their country so they may ask for advice and help should  they fall victim to a cyber incident. Ambassadors and, in general, the  concept of multipliers are fundamental to achieve greater outreach  and to overcome the language barrier and the culture gap. ECSM  activities were given a boost by having the winning ECSC team launch  the campaign, and by Member States’ efforts to approach national  celebrities to promote the campaign in their countries.  In 2021, a concept was created for measuring the impact of the  campaign and its effect on behavioural change. It will be tested and  deployed in 2022.  ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2021 69  PART I. Achievements of the year  9.4.  Organise the International  Cybersecurity Challenge  Because of the COVID-19 pandemic and the restrictions imposed by  the Greek government on events organised indoors, the ICC event  was postponed to June 2022. Despite the COVID-19 restrictions, ENISA  was able to expand the steering committee of the ICC, which now  comprises more than 100 people from 64 countries. ENISA organised  monthly meetings in which all ICC teams participated actively  throughout 2021.  The Agency also designed logos for ICC and the EU team, identified  sponsors for the event, developed a media strategy and established  the platforms that will host the ICC challenges in June 2022.  Furthermore, all the administrative issues (venue, catering and  transportation needs for teams, website, merchandise, awards for  the winning teams, invited guests) were completed in 2021, ensuring  a successful event in 2022.  ENISA was responsible for forming and training the EU team to enter  the ICC. To this end, ENISA formed a pool of 55 candidates from  21 Member States and organised two training events, which took  place in Tallinn and Turin, in which the vast majority of the EU team  candidates participated. In these events, ENISA provided training on  multiple modules (cryptography, forensics, mobile exploitation, web  exploitation, reverse engineering, attack and defence, and ethics).  It is imperative that ENISA continues its involvement in the ICC, as  ENISA has:  • successfully managed to have all seven teams travel to participate  in the 2022 ICC (more than 65 countries provide participants in  these teams);  • streamlined the 2023 ICC (it will be hosted by the Cybersecurity and  Infrastructure Security Agency in the United States, probably during  Black Hat in Las Vegas), and there are already nominations for the  2024 and 2025 ICCs (nations from Oceania and Africa);  • will continue to be responsible for handling the ICC steering  committee and guiding the rules and governance of ICC;  • will need to train and form the EU team that will take part in the  2023 ICC, commencing this activity from July 2022;  • engaged with sponsors that are interested in capacity building  globally (ISACA and Northern Ireland Co-operation Overseas (NiCo),  which has funding from the EEAS) and is assisting developing  countries in creating and participating in capture the flag’s.  The ECSM 2021 deployment report can be found online  (https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/european-cybersecurity- month-2021-deployment-report).  The ECSM continues for the 10th year in 2022. Overall, this is a highly  appreciated project, and Member States see great value in ENISA´s  coordinating actions. ENISA should further reflect on spreading activities  throughout the year, achieving a peak in October. The output should  remain as is for the 2023 SPD.  70  9.5.  Activities to promote  and ensure the uptake  of information on  good cybersecurity  practices (including on  EU strategies, security  by design and privacy by  design at EU level, and  cybersecurity certification  schemes) by different  target groups  The projects under this activity comprised thematic campaigns and the  deployment of a supporting framework (for internal use):  • publication dissemination and promotion strategy for awareness- raising providing pragmatic steps to define, address and evaluate  awareness-raising campaigns (report for internal use);  • two in-house campaigns and three campaigns in collaboration with  other EU institutions:  –  in-person awareness-raising campaign for SMEs, highlighting the  SME tool, report and booklet on best practices for SMEs, and with  the additional goal of understanding the ecosystem of SMEs and  how to reach SMEs and raise their awareness;  –  an awareness-raising campaign on certification called ‘What’s In It  for the Conformity Assessment Bodies?’ aims to empower these  key players in future EU certification through a short video and  frequently asked questions;  –  #NoMoreRansom with Europol to raise awareness of ransomware  through a dialogue led on Twitter;  –  #Women4Cyber and #CyberBecause in collaboration with  the Commission to invite women and students to choose  cybersecurity careers.  The analysis of the results of each campaign indicate that a systematic  approach and proper planning is the key. Given this, ENISA will  continue projects launched in 2021 through the coming years, focusing  each year on another target audience. For 2022, the continuation  of these campaigns is already planned, with an earlier coordination  of contributors and more resources dedicated to them.  The output should be continued, as it reflects the tasks of the CSA on  awareness and promotion of cybersecurity practices. The educational  roadmap is also included as a project under this output, which we  advise maintaining for the 2023 SPD as a separate output.

This is important, as it creates a uniform understanding of how to ensure best  performance and manage risks. It also solidifies the role of NLOs and the ENISA Advisory Group in the scoping  and validation of outputs and deliverables.  The Agency also developed and put in place a framework for evaluating the allocation of its HR and reviewing  this annually, to be able to reassign resources in an agile fashion in line with its operational priorities. This should  further strengthen the Agency’s performance management and planning.  In addition, the Agency prepared for the roll-out of a new document management system (Advanced Records  System (ARES)) by signing a service level agreement (SLA) with the Directorate-General for Informatics. The  testing and final implementation of ARES are expected to take place in 2022; this, along with the established  internal IT strategy, intellectual property rights (IPR) strategy and sensitive posts policy, helps to better mitigate  any administrative risks.  Resources The continuation of a number of projects had to be carried forward to 2022, such as the revision of the business  continuity plan and ENISA website revamp, because of internal human resource constraints, in particular legacy  aspects, duty of care and projects initiated in 2020 without clear internal support. Weaknesses in internal  controls found by the European Court of Auditors (ECA) in 2020 resulted in reassessment of staffing needs  to support this function in the course of 2021, which will be further implemented in the course of 2022.  Overall assessment The structure of Activity 10 supports the mandate of the Executive Director’s Office. The KPIs in relation to the  performance management framework needs better alignment with the staff survey to allow broader coverage  of its dimensions. In 2022 a new output was introduced to better outline the corporate communications  strategy. Since the Executive Director’s Office also supports the secretariats of several statutory bodies – namely  the Management Board, the Executive Board, the Advisory Group and the NLO Network – a separate output  could be considered to better reflect resource needs for this task.  Objectives  •  Increase effectiveness and efficiency in achieving  the agency’s objectives  •  Make the performance of ENISA fully compliant  with legal and financial frameworks (build  a culture of compliance)  •  Protect the agency’s assets and reputation, while  reducing risks  Link to corporate objective  •  Sound resource and risk management  ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2021 73  PART I. Achievements of the year  Results  •  Maximise value for money provided to stakeholders and citizens  • Build lasting credibility and trust  Outputs  10.1.  Roll out an Agency- wide performance  management framework  and systems across its  functions  Outcome  At the end of 2020, ENISA had developed a performance  management roadmap with five dimensions. In 2021 the following  initiatives were undertaken within each dimension.  • External stakeholders dimension: stakeholder strategy project begun  in 2021 and expected to be delivered in 2022 by ARET.  • People and capabilities dimension: strategic workforce review initiated  and concluded in 2021 by Corporate Support Services. As part of  this dimension under the constraints of the working regime during  the COVID-19 pandemic, emphasis was put on developing internal  communication, in particular to support remote work. Regular online  meetings with staff were organised, including introducing the ENISA  Academy to facilitate internal knowledge building.  • Organisation culture dimension: continuous information flow by the  Communications sector via weekly question and answer sessions  and intranet notifications among others.  • Internal processes dimension: evaluation of ENISA tooling needs  carried out in 2021 by Executive Director’s Office. Implementation  of the new project management tool is expected in 2022. In addition,  the preparation for ARES included the development of a filing plan  and special retention list for documents.  The outcome of the work conducted in 2021 provides a basis for improving  performance across the agency in both operational and corporate areas.  The implementation of these roadmap dimensions, namely internal  processes and costs and benefits, will continue in 2022 by complementing  an overall corporate strategy to be developed in coordination with Activity  11. The roll-out of this output should also continue in 2023 with an  assessment by the end of 2022 of whether the scope should be revisited.  10.2.  Develop, establish  and implement a risk  management plan and  systems, including an  anti-fraud strategy,  a conflict of interest  policy, a whistleblowing  policy, an information  security policy, an anti- harassment policy and  an IPR policy  The main achievements in 2021 were:  • ENISA’s anti-fraud strategy was updated and adopted (Management  Board Decision MB/2021/5); a dedicated anti-fraud website  is available on ENISA’s intranet for all staff;  • ENISA’s conflict of interest policy was updated and adopted  (Management Board Decision MB/2021/15);  • the revision of the ENISA’s IT policy and procedural framework was  kicked off, including the Agency’s information security policy;  • the ENISA’s IPR policy was developed, adopted and published online  (https://www.enisa.europa.eu/about-enisa/legal-notice/enisa-ipr- policy-public-version);  74  • several specific risk assessments were conducted in different areas  with a view to establishing lessons learned and recommendations  for the future (e.g. in the areas of recruitment, IT security and  incident management).  In 2021 the agency handled complaints to the European Ombudsman,  reports and recommendations of the European Anti-Fraud Office, the  ECA and the Internal Audit Service (IAS) as well as the legal aspects  related to the implementation of ENISA’s seat agreement with the host  country, in accordance with the overview provided under the KPIs.  The Data Protection Officer provided advice on several operational and  administrative matters, maintained the ENISA’s register of processing  activities, cooperated with the EDPS and contributed to the activities  of the EUIs Data Protection Officers network (co-chair of Data  Protection Officers–ICT Advisory Committee of the EU Agencies  and Institutions Working Group).  ENISA has a full-time Information Security Officer, appointed since  2019, who coordinates its information security management system.  ENISA’s Information Security Officer contributed to several related activities  in 2021, such as the ENISA annual security risk assessment exercise,  regular vulnerability assessments and penetrations tests of ENISA systems,  network security monitoring and incident response, advising on internal  security policies, etc. The Information Security Officer works in close  cooperation with the CERT-EU on the aforementioned matters.  Overall, the output in 2022 continues to maintain compliance aspects.  Some work planned in 2021 was not completed, namely updating the  whistleblowing policy and implementing the risk management plan  and systems. In 2021 the main focus was on lessons learned, with  a view to establishing a comprehensive risk assessment methodology  for ENISA in the course of 2022. Output is adjusted in the 2022  work programme and should be continued in line with the results  of ENISA’s risk assessment, and the risk appetite and risk-mitigating  measures defined by the ENISA Management Team in 2022.  10.3.  Develop and implement  an agency-wide IT  strategy  10.4.  Carry out relevant  training and develop  guidelines for staff  An agency-wide IT strategy was developed and adopted.  The output will continue in 2022 with an emphasis on developing and  updating several IT-related policies in close coordination with Activity 11,  aiming to introduce the ISO 27001 standard at ENISA by the end of 2024.  • Four internal courses on data protection (general data protection,  procurement and cloud services, events, data protection by design)  were held.  • Information security awareness training (via an external platform)  took place.  • There was an information session on ENISA’s IPR policy.  • Assistants trained ENISA newcomers in the use of internal tools and  its financial cycle.  • Guidance was issued to staff on several implementation provisions  of the Seat agreement with the Hellenic Republic.  ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2021 75  PART I. Achievements of the year  The output in 2021 focused on compliance and this will continue in 2022  with an emphasis on guidance for staff on ethics, conduct, tools and  processes introduced as part of outputs 10.1 and 10.2.

Newly appointed middle managers were asked  to assist in bringing about meaningful outcomes as a result of the reorganisation. The new way of working  and operating under a matrix set-up brought out a lot of knowledge-sharing opportunities and steered  the agency resources towards a first step of more flexible ways of operating.  Staff motivation was a priority, and ENISA continues to strive to keep staff highly engaged. However, nearly one  quarter of ENISA staff find that they have limited opportunities to grow within the Agency, and are not satisfied  with their work. This is a clear indicator that the Agency needs to further address staff development, and  enhance job satisfaction. The matrix set-up also allowed staff to unfold talents and use them to achieve quality  outcomes across all areas of agency activity; however, the Agency needs to work more concretely towards this  goal, revamp its learning and development policy and move towards business-driven learning needs. The Agency  conducted its annual staff survey, in which staff had the opportunity to express their views, and for the Agency  to carry out follow-up actions. The Agency took measures to address complaints and continues to establish open  communication channels with staff, both directly and through representatives on the staff committee.  As the Agency shifted to a combined qualitative as well as quantitative approach to management, new  management instruments were introduced to monitor performance on quarterly, four-monthly and annual  bases, providing a dense framework of performance and continuous improvement. The reclassification exercise  was improved in order to steer the process towards qualitative elements of assessment and focus on outputs  and behaviours that are widely observed and recognised, as means to promote best practices.  Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic and during 2021, the agency has introduced and maintained permanent  teleworking options while maintaining and enhancing employee motivation, efficiency and development.  Such measures enhanced the Agency’s flexibility and drive to manage its people and services using modern  HR practices. Such measures also helped the Agency recognise the importance of staff flexibility in the modern  working environment while shifting process improvement to remote management practices.  During 2021 ENISA focused on attracting, retaining and developing talent, and building ENISA’s reputation  as an employer of choice and an agile and knowledge-based organisation where staff can develop personally  and professionally, while keeping staff engaged and motivated and providing a sense of belonging.  Action has been taken to build an attractive workspace by establishing and maintaining excellent working  conditions (premises, layout of office space). The move of ENISA to its new office location, the refurbishment  and the improvement of the office space were steps towards improved working conditions. Such improvements  occurred while developing user-centric (tele)working functionalities. The existing infrastructure for secure remote  connections enabled the Agency to switch to teleworking seamlessly when the building became unavailable  because of the lockdowns triggered by the pandemic. However, the Agency is facing significant challenges in its  audiovisual and videoconferencing capabilities, which need to be further upgraded and steered towards more  state-of-the-art services in order to help the Agency meet its operational objectives. Moreover, the Agency needs  to further review its IT policies, practices and monitoring to improve the service delivery it offers to its users.  However, the IT tools the unit uses do not support a modern, sustainable and flexible working environment, and  they require significant investment in order to move towards simpler but user-centric tools.  ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2021 77  PART I. Achievements of the year  Resources In terms of resourcing, the unit faced resource constraints on implementing its activity programme due to the  increased administrative procedures and the move to the new premises. To perform its objectives, the Agency  relied heavily on delivering its services through interim agents who supported the day-to-day administrative  burden in the support functions. Considering that increased support was also needed following the  reorganisation, 10 additional interim agents were allocated to cover ongoing needs. The preparation for the new  building also put an additional strain on the financial and procurement team, which had to administer additional  financial processes to implement the move in compliance with approved standards.  While tasks were assigned based on the physical location of the Agency (Athens, Brussels, Heraklion), this old  way of managing resources did not support a more flexible way of operating and as a result increased the daily  operational complexity and staffing needs. A particular constraint that was established was in the area of facility  management, where the scope and breadth of activities was greater; however, the Agency had allocated 1 FTE  located in Heraklion to managing the facilities at all locations, or requirements were addressed ad hoc. Some  of the facility management activities had been undertaken by the retiring security officer, which resulted in an  operational gap for the unit.  As a result, a lot of activities in facility management were not tackled. In addition, the introduction of the  Information Technology Management Committee (ITMC) and Budget Management Committee (BMC), while the  Agency moved to more centralised IT governance, created a new way of operating for the Corporate Support  Services Unit, which brought about further delays in project implementation. At the end of the year, to address  the Agency’s operational needs for meetings, a refurbishment plan was proposed and endorsed to reconstruct  part of the conference area and part of some office space. The refurbishment also included the redesign of the  boardroom. For this reason, a carry-over (EUR 643 407) was planned in order to cater for this project.  Regarding the unit’s knowledge, additional investment needs to be made in educating the unit further and  bringing its human capital up to date with the latest practices by means of traditional conventional training  and on-the-job learning and job-sharing activities. This would establish a solid basis for further enhancing the  operational capability of the team to meet its objectives. Considering that the Agency operates on project-based  methodologies and has reorganised its operation, the unit struggles to keep up with the new way of working  as incoming requests come from all users. Also considering that this was the first year it operated following the  reorganisation and the arrival of a new head of CSS, the unit has started to build up its knowledge levels slowly  but steadily. While peer-learning continues, the professionalisation of the CSS services must go hand in hand  with service optimisation while at the same time building up the knowledge level of its staff. Besides that, one  of the challenges the unit faces is the grading of its staff in relation to the activities, and responsibilities fulfilled.  While the unit will engage in a service delivery roadmap transition, the job responsibilities and grading will be  reviewed in order to reflect the exact level of responsibilities performed.  Overall assessment Overall, it is evident that the relevance of the structure of the activity, its outputs and its KPIs need to be reviewed  in order to reflect the full-service provision the unit offers. During the implementation, it was evident that not all  service outputs were identified under Activity 11, while there were overlaps with Activity 10 on many occasions,  as both units share a compliance, coordinating, project and policy-driven angle but tackle it from different  perspectives. Therefore, activities 10 and 11 need to be revised in the 2023 SPD to more closely reflect the work  carried out.  Based on the existing output description in the SPD, it has proven challenging to link various initiatives of the CSS  unit to the output descriptions of this activity and to cater for the main elements of service provision, which are  recurrent services. This has created a lot of challenges in the implementation capabilities as well as the reporting  capabilities of the unit. Overall, the recurrent service provision, service optimisation and security-related outputs  should be further reflected in the 2023 SPD while redrafting the existing outputs in a way that supports more  flexible implementation of activities in order to assist the Agency to meet its corporate objectives. Considering  the 2021 results, in 2022, CSS went for a back-to-basics action plan (review of rules, tools, map as-is format, etc.)  in which the building blocks are being set up to cater for the challenges of the future. This initiative will need to  continue in 2023 onwards while building upon the strategic and service delivery model.  78  Objectives  •  Engaged staff who are committed and motivated  to deliver and who are empowered to fully use  their talents, skills and competences  •  Digitally enabled workplace and environment  (including home workspace) that cultivates and  nourishes performance, and enhances social and  environmental responsibility  Link to corporate objective  •  Build an agile organisation focused on people  Results  •  ENISA as an employer of choice  Outputs  11.1.  Implementation of the  competence framework  (including the training  strategy, CDR report,  internal competitions,  exit interviews)  Outcome  In 2021, the HR sector embarked upon a continuation of the  development of the competency framework. It wished to  operationalise the competency framework in different processes  of the talent management life cycle, namely recruitment, performance  management and appraisals, reclassification and contract renewal,  and learning and development. The challenges faced in the matter  were related to the differentiation of competency expectations (i.e.  competencies and proficiency levels), between different roles and  grades in the organisation, as well as internal consistency in the use  of competency expectations (i.e. competencies and proficiency levels).  It was also deemed crucial to have overall clarity and transparency  for staff, and related principles such as objectivity, transparency  and fairness.  HR worked on addressing challenges related to the construction  of the competency framework, potentially necessary changes  and adaptations, and a conceptual approach on how to use the  competency framework in HR processes. This was closely related  to having staff members who are highly motivated and loyal to the  organisation and whose competencies are used in the right place,  at the right time.  In practice, the newly established competency framework is proving  to be quite challenging to implement, so a further simplification review  is envisaged in the course of 2022–2023. The Agency plans a revision  of the framework to simplify it with the possible aim of tying it to  a revision of its job-mapping and -grading structure for future strategic  workforce-planning activities.  Having regard to the need to reorganise the services of the unit, and work on the synergies identified among the  various sectors, the Agency suggests that the Management Board adjust the outputs of this activity and redefine  them in a way that supports the Agency’s transformation in order to meet its strategic objectives. It is also further  envisaged that Activities 10 and 11 be redefined to better synergise the complementarity of the two units.  ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2021 79  PART I. Achievements of the year  HR examined the feedback from the exit interviews and staff  surveys to identify those points that need to be addressed in order  to continue improving its services. Feedback received was mainly  directed at the cumbersome administrative processes, lack of  internal communication or unclarity about where the information  may be found easily, and sometimes at organisational complexity  or complacency that prevents innovative ideas and practices from  contributing more to the strategic objectives.  Regarding recruitment and onboarding, a lot of emphasis was given to  sourcing good candidates with diverse backgrounds; however, budget  restrictions prohibited the use of a wide range of sourcing options. The  administrative process behind the recruitment procedures was lengthy  and cumbersome, which led to operational delays. Emphasis needs  to be put on simplifying the recruitment procedures, educating ENISA  staff and obtaining a tool to speed up ENISA’s response to sourcing  talents that would help the Agency fulfil its strategic needs.  The results of the KPIs associated with this output indicate a first  good step towards the activity outputs; however, there is a lot of work  that the Agency needs to do to further establish the pillars for talent  development and increased job satisfaction. The parameters can move  outside the barriers of HR and also encompass working conditions,  digitalisation of services, self-service functionalities, simplification  of procedures, etc.  Given the outcomes of 2021, the added value achieved and the related  actions already planned in the 2022 SPD, the output description was  very restrictive and limited the possibilities and breadth of actions  the unit could engage in. The Agency needs to move towards more  forward-looking practices and adopt an overall corporate strategy  that addresses its HR, IT, security, facility management and financial  challenges. Therefore, a more holistic revision of this objective is  needed, in close partnership with the Executive Director’s Office,  to address the corporate objective and the challenges of the future.  Therefore, the Agency suggests that the Management Board adjust the  outputs for the 2023 SPD and redefine them in a broader context that  would better fit the corporate objective.  11.2.  Actions to develop and  nourish talent (in line  with output 11.1)  During Q4 2021, HR deep-dived into performance management and  revamped the current framework, within the limits of the applicable  Management Board rules adopted in 2015. Nourishing performance  and career progress is a top priority for the HR sector, which is why  there were numerous and extensive training courses organised for  staff and management, as well as several seminars dedicated to the  performance management framework. The appraisal exercise is under  way, and the lessons learned from the new approach will be evaluated  in the course of 2022.  In response to the pandemic and the need to have a digitally enabled  workplace and environment, in Q1 2021 the agency extended its  welfare scheme by adopting a decision on the reimbursement of  Internet expenses since March 2020 retroactively. Within the context  of a broader welfare package, the Agency continues to pay attention  to the benefits it offers to its staff in order to balance out the reduced  coefficient rate and legal limitations regarding flexible work practices.  80  The Agency also ensured that ergonomic equipment such as chairs,  monitors and peripherals were distributed to staff, to ensure that their  home environments were sufficiently equipped for them to continue  to perform their duties.  In terms of nourishing talent, besides the broad learning offer that  is available to staff, the Agency offers on-the-job development  opportunities through its annual call for contributions in its teams.  This is a way to enhance talent, work on fields outside one’s own,  bridge the gap between operational and support units, and give  opportunities for new ideas and new contributors to combine  knowledge sharing with additional outputs. It is unfortunate that not  many candidates from support units contributed to the team outputs,  which is an indicator the Agency needs to consider thoroughly.  Besides that, the Agency needs to further develop the 70–20–10  model for learning and development in the course of its upcoming  SPD to capitalise on its staff strengths and competencies and promote  a collaborative, open culture of learning. To do so, the Agency needs  to steer its budget not only towards training activities that would  enhance the technical aspects of the training, which need to be more  closely focused on its strategic objectives, but also towards investing  in educating staff. Additional budget would need to be provided  following the review of the Agency’s L&D policy and framework.  The Agency needs to further explore and reassess its corporate  strategy and consequent HR strategy in order to identify ways of  improving ENISA and attracting talents in the competitive cyberfield  world. While doing so, the Agency needs to shift its talents towards  a more flexible and agile workforce so resources are allocated to  business priorities. Therefore, the Agency needs to build on its  current base and adopt an efficiency gains strategy addressing all  levels by revising its HR, finance and corporate services practices.  By doing so, the Agency needs to further elaborate and align its  strategic workforce-planning practices, data analytics and workload  indicators while reviewing and simplifying its current administrative  procedures by improving its tools or revising its existing practices.  Additional revision of ENISA’s financial model is required in order to  enhance accountability across all layers of the Agency while reducing  administrative procedures. The introduction of Mission Integrated  processing system and the Public Procurement Management Tool in  2022 and 2023 would be a first step towards this model revision.  The results of the KPIs associated with this output indicate a first  good step towards the activity outputs; however, there is a lot of work  that the Agency needs to do to further establish the pillars for talent  development and increased job satisfaction. The parameters can move  outside the barriers of HR and also encompass working conditions,  digitalisation of services, self-service functionalities, simplification of  procedures, etc. Significant work needs to be done on revisiting the  job descriptions and moving towards job profiling and competency  development, while focusing on learning activities that add value  to the business objectives and support professional advancement,  establishing multiple career path options.  Given the outcomes of 2021, the added value achieved and the related  actions already planned in the 2022 SPD, the output was partly achieved,  as it was focused only on the HR component in isolation. In line with the  revised CSS way forward, the agency suggests that the Management  Board redefine this output and increase its scope in the 2023 SPD.  ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2021 81  PART I. Achievements of the year  11.3.  Undertake actions to  support a digital working  environment and  develop necessary tools  and services in line with  output 10.3  While continuing with a burdensome administrative way of working,  in 2021 the Agency enhanced the structure of its digital working  environment, by improving its collaboration platforms by moving to  SharePoint 2019 on its premises, and by migrating ENISA’s repository  structure to an updated environment. ENISA also built up its  conferencing capacity by renewing Webex online conferencing and  activating end-to-end encryption, and set up a boardroom facility  in the new headquarters in Athens as the basis of an updated  videoconferencing infrastructure.  ENISA also reinforced the ability of staff and contractors to telework by  promoting a replacement teleworking solution for the current system,  which is reaching the end of support (Microsoft Direct Access), and  moving towards a new teleworking solution (FortiVPN), which started  as a successful pilot in 2021 and aspires to be functional in Q3 2022.  Finally, the Agency undertook an assessment of its tooling needs under  Activity 10 (see main achievements under Activity 10).  In terms of digital simplifications, the Agency undertook a series of  initiatives and continued its transition from paper-based to self-service  functionalities by preparing further HR modules in Sysper and ARES.  In 2021, the Agency also conducted an analysis conducted internal  testing on introducing Mission Integrated processing system and the  Public Procurement Management Tool for its mission and procurement  procedures. The pilot phases were successful and the Agency is now  preparing the transition to the full Agency in 2022. However, it has to  be noted that introducing all these systems came in addition to the  work performed by staff, without additional resources being provided.  In 2021, with the arrival of the new head of CSS, the Agency will look  further into the service provision of its services and move towards  a service-based model. A further analysis needs to be made in 2022  in order to identify and map which services it will keep in house and  those it will outsource. To do so, the Agency will need additional  budget to cater for the new modus operandi and look in more detail  at its outputs and workload indicators, so that it can reshuffle priorities  according to its business needs. To further support the efficiency  gain strategy and the business model transformation, additional  budget is needed to support the units in outsourcing services to  external providers.  The results of the KPIs associated with this output indicate a first good  step towards the activity’s outputs; however, these were primarily  IT driven, and other components are needed to contribute towards  an improved digital working environment. The Agency needs to further  redefine its IT service provision model and service optimisation in order  to cater for the challenges of the future, while including in its scope  activities beyond IT that contribute to this goal.  Given the outcomes of 2021, the added value achieved and the  related actions already planned in the 2022 SPD, the output was partly  achieved, as the concrete outputs under this activity and the KPIs  reflected the former set-up of the CSS unit. In line with the revised CSS  way forward, the Agency will suggest to the Management Board to  redefine this activity and increase its scope in the 2023 SPD.  82  11.4.  Planning, preparation  and completion of the  establishment of the  Agency’s headquarters in  its new premises in line  with the objectives of the  activity  During 2021, the Agency planned, prepared and moved to its  new headquarters building, ensuring minimal disruption to its  operations. An internal team supported the move throughout the  process and coordinated with internal and external stakeholders,  including the creation of a detailed plan for all phases of the  successful implementation.  Throughout the year, all ENISA staff and managers were involved in  exploring the best use of the new facilities and how the future work of  the Agency should be conducted to strengthen the Agency’s creativity,  collaboration, values and mandate. The building is now operational;  however, additional work is required in order to improve the existing  facilities, improve its audiovisual services, and cater for more open and  collaborative work practices. The Agency also needs to reflect more  holistically on its hot-desking and office-sharing policy, so that its facilities  practices contribute practically to an open and collaborative yet agile  way of working. The new building also brings a lot of daily challenges  in facility management, and the Agency has decided to outsource the  facility management service in order to alleviate pressure on resources  while maintaining a fully functioning building. Thus, additional funds are  needed in order to ensure that the Agency fulfils its strategic objectives.  The Agency also proceeded further in preparing to open a Brussels  office, which will help keep operational activities secure and assist the  Agency in fulfilling its operational mandate.  Given the outcomes of 2021, the added value achieved and the related  actions already planned in the 2022 SPD, the output description was  met. The Agency needs to move towards more forward-looking practices  and adopt an overall corporate strategy that addresses its HR, IT,  security, facility management and financial challenges. Therefore, the  Agency suggests that the Management Board adjust the output for the  2023 SPD and redefine it in a broader context.

ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2021 85  PART I. Achievements of the year  II  ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2021 87  1 MANAGEMENT BOARD  In 2021 the Management Board met for two  ordinary meetings.  In total, the Management Board made 19 decisions  during the year, such as on the anti-fraud strategy  and its action plan, on the setting up of a local office  in Brussels and on EU classified information.  As part of its functions, the Management Board  adopted its analysis and assessment of the 2020  annual activity report, in which it commended  the Agency on the very high standard achieved in  the delivery of its work. The Management Board  also expressed its favourable opinion on the final  annual accounts for 2020 and adopted the ENISA  programming document 2022–2024, including the  2022 budget and the 2022 establishment plan.  Sharing information with the Management Board  regularly, ENISA reported on the work programme  and budget implementation, and gave updates  on the reorganisation and the relocation of the  ENISA headquarters in Athens, among other  pertinent matters.  In addition, the Management Board provided  guidance on the ENISA stakeholder strategy.  The Executive Board had one formal meeting  per quarter.  2 MAJOR DEVELOPMENTS  The 2021 work programme was developed to  enable the Agency to fully exploit its permanent  mandate and fulfil all the tasks given to it by the CSA,  while taking into account all other changes in the  EU’s regulatory framework. In addition, the 2021 work  programme was aligned with ENISA’s new strategy,  which was adopted by the Management Board in  June 2020 and was used as a baseline to set the  strategic objectives and priorities for planning the  Agency’s work using a multi-annual framework.  Reorganisation  The 2021 programming document was drawn up in  parallel with the reorganisation of the Agency, which  was agreed by the Management Board in June 2020  and became effective on 1 January 2021. The new  organisational structure is aligned with the tasks and  functions of the Agency’s structural set-up under  the CSA, thus allowing more efficient delivery of  the activities in the work programme. A framework  was established for the organisation of the work of  all staff members of the Agency. The Management  Team assists the Executive Director in his functions,  ensuring that activities undertaken by the agency  under its work programme add value for the Union  and are planned and implemented in a coordinated  fashion. Its role is to enhance cooperation and to  build synergies across the organisation through an  PART II (A) MANAGEMENT  8888  open exchange of views and shared information.  The following units were established to ensure the  performance of the tasks of the agency as set out  in the CSA:  Policy Development and Implementation Unit  to implement Article 5 of the CSA;  Capacity Building Unit to implement Article 6 and  Article 7(5) of the CSA;  Operational Cooperation Unit to implement  Article 7 (except for Article 7(5)) of the CSA;  Market, Certification and Standardisation Unit to  implement Articles 8 and 22 and Title III of the CSA.  The following four teams were established and tasked  with articles of the CSA:  Knowledge and Information Team to implement  Article 9;  Awareness Raising and Education Team  to implement Article 10;  Research and Innovation Team to implement  Article 11;  International Cooperation Team to implement  Articles 12 and 42.  In addition, two corporate units were established  to support the Executive Director:  the Executive Director’s Office ensures that the  Agency has in place an operational performance  management framework, anti-fraud policies, and  an internal evaluation and control framework so  that the agency follows the objectives of sound  budgetary management and complies with its  legal obligations (including conflict of interest  rules and ethical standards);  the Corporate Support Service ensures that  the Agency has modern capabilities and tools  to manage and develop its HR, in particular  talent management programmes (learning and  development), a workforce recruitment and  retention strategy, and adequate employee  services (including individual rights and salaries).  Establishment of IT Management  Committee and Budget Management  Committee  The ITMC was established in the first quarter of  2021, to ensure the comprehensive and coordinated  management of the Agency’s IT systems and services  required to fulfil its core tasks, as described by its  operational mandate, and corporate functions.  The mandate of the ITMC encompasses the entire  life cycle of all relevant IT projects, including setting  the overall framework and guiding the development,  roll-out and implementation as well as follow-up  and analysis.  The BMC was established in the last quarter of 2020.  The mandate of the BMC is to ensure coherent  planning, implementation and follow-up of the  Agency’s budget, and encompasses the entire life  cycle of the budget, including assisting in setting the  overall framework and guiding the development,  roll-out and implementation as well as follow-up and  analysis of the budget. Therefore, the BMC issued  budget implementation reports and submitted them  to the Management Team, reflecting the status of  implementation of the budget as of 1 May 2021 and  1 September 2021, and targeted interim reports  every quarter to tackle specific issues arising from the  implementation of the budget.  Structured cooperation with the  Computer Emergency Response Team  for the EU Institutions, Bodies and  Agencies  The reporting year also marked the point when  structured cooperation between ENISA and CERT-EU  in the field of operational cooperation became fully  operational with the annual cooperation plan and the  MoU between ENISA and CERT-EU.  New headquarters in Athens  In agreement with the Greek authorities, ENISA moved  into its new headquarters in Athens in 2021 to meet  the growing needs of the Agency.  The Agency moved into the new headquarters  building in the third quarter of 2021, ensuring minimal  disruption to operations. An internal workgroup  supported the move throughout the process and  coordinated with internal and external stakeholders,  including the creation of a detailed plan for all phases  of successful implementation.  Throughout the year, all ENISA staff and managers  were involved in exploring the best use of the new  facilities and how the future work of the Agency should  be conducted to strengthen the Agency’s creativity,  collaboration and corporate values. In response to the  COVID-19 pandemic, new consideration was given to  hybrid ways of working that will affect how the Agency  best uses its resources. During this discussion, the  environmental impacts of the Agency’s operations  ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2021 89  PART II. Management  and performance were considered in the light of the  desired environmental management strategy that  was developed.  Brussels local office  The ENISA local office in Brussels was established  with a view to implementing structured cooperation  with CERT-EU and maintaining regular and systematic  cooperation with EUIBAs including but not limited to  CERT-EU, the EEAS, Europol, the EDA and/or other  competent bodies involved in cybersecurity, in order  to benefit from synergies and avoid the duplication  of activities.  Recruitment  In 2020 the Agency embarked on a large-scale novel  recruitment exercise to create a sufficiently diverse and  broad reserve shortlist of 75 candidates with broader  competences and skills that could be used to recruit  staff and thus fill the gaps in the current establishment  plan, as well as serving as a pool of candidates for  the future establishment plan. Through the success  of this call, ENISA welcomed 31 newcomers in 2021  (22 temporary agents, 5 contract agents, 3 seconded  national experts and 1 trainee), an increase in staff  members of over 25 %. ENISA’s workforce planning has  allowed the Agency to proactively estimate, engage,  develop and align its HR with the evolving strategic  focus of its activities and objectives as directed by its  SPDs, the Management Board and Union legislation.  3 BUDGETARY AND FINANCIAL  MANAGEMENT  a) FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT  The Agency operated with a budget of  EUR 23.5 million, equivalent to an 8 % increase  in 2021 compared with the 2020 budget  (EUR 21.7 million). An amending budget was adopted  by the Management Board by written procedure  on 21 December 2021, reflecting new challenges  and priorities stemming from the move to the new  office building in Athens and the COVID-19 pandemic.  Amending budget 1/2021 was adopted in order  to finance new projects and activities amounting  to EUR 0.5 million, mostly related to refurbishment  needs for the new office.  In 2021 ENISA concluded a total of 58 public  procurement procedures (two of which were  undertaken jointly with the European Centre for  the Development of Vocational Training (Cedefop)):  31 were done through reopening of competitions  under framework contracts (53 %);  15 were done through negotiated procedures  for middle- and low-value contracts (26 %);  8 were done using the open procedure (14 %);  3 were done using the restricted procedure (5 %);  1 was done using the CEI procedure (2 %).  EUR 3.02 was paid in 2021 to suppliers as interest  for late payments.  The table below shows ENISA’s budget  implementation targets and achievements  in 2021, which remained high under the  restrictive circumstances imposed by COVID-19.  Area Objective Target 2021 Level of completion 2021  Budget implementation (appropriations  committed through the year)  Efficiency and sound  financial management 99 % 99.51 %  Payments against appropriations of the  year (C1 funds)  Efficiency and sound  financial management 85 % 77.40 %  Payments against appropriations carried  over from previous year (C8 funds)  Efficiency and sound  financial management 95 % 96.55 %  In agreement with  the Greek authorities,  ENISA moved into its  new headquarters in  Athens in 2021 to meet  the growing needs of  the Agency.  9090  b) BUDGET EXECUTION OF EU SUBSIDY (C1 FUNDS  OF CURRENT YEAR 2021)  During 2021, ENISA committed EUR 22 721 149,  representing 99.51 % of the total budget for the  year. Payments made during the year amounted to  EUR 17 672 344, representing 77.40 % of the total  budget. The budgetary execution was high despite  the restrictive circumstances imposed by COVID-19.  Compared with 2020, there was a noticeable  increase in commitment execution – 99.51 % in 2021  compared with 97.35 % in 2020 – and a noticeable  increase in payment execution – 77.40 % compared  with 68.62 % in 2020. The target of 95 % for  commitment rate set by the Commission (Directorate- General for Budget) was reached. The commitment  appropriations corresponding to the EU subsidy (C1  appropriations) that were not paid at the end of 2021  were carried forward to 2022.  c) AMENDING BUDGET / BUDGETARY TRANSFERS  According to Article 26 of ENISA’s applicable  financial rules, the Executive Director may transfer  appropriations from one title to another up to  a maximum of 10 % of the appropriations for the  financial year shown on the line from which the transfer  is made. Transfers within the same title are permitted  without limit. Beyond the limit referred to above, the  Executive Director may propose to the Management  Board transfers of appropriations from one title to  another. The Management Board has two weeks to  oppose the proposed transfers. After that time limit,  the proposed transfers are deemed to be adopted.  The Agency made four transfers in the reporting  year by the decision of the Executive Director on  the initial budget, and one transfer by the decision  of the Executive Director on the amended budget  (in comparison, the Executive Director made three  transfers on the initial budget and four transfers on  the amended budget in 2020). The four transfers on  the initial budget included one transfer within title  and three transfers between titles and within title.  The only transfer on the amended budget was both  within title and between titles. Because of COVID-19  restrictions and of the move to the new building,  funds were mainly redirected from salaries, meetings,  conferences, other events and business travel to  support mostly refurbishment-related needs for the  new office, and staff development and learning needs.  The table below summarises the execution of the budget in 2021 by title.  2021 budget (C1)  Area of  budget  allocation  Appropriation  amount (EUR)  (1)  Commitment  amount (EUR)  (2)  Percentage  committed  (2)/(1)  Payment  amount  (EUR) (3)  Percentage  paid  (3)/(1)  Amount carried  forward to 2022  (EUR)  Title I 10 707 109 10 701 572 99.95 9 993 015 93.33 708 558  Title II (*) 3 662 751 3 636 207 99.28 1 472 134 40.19 2 164 073  Title III 8 463 200 8 383 370 99.06 6 207 195 73.34 2 176 174  TOTAL 22 833 060 22 721 149 99.51 17 672 344 77.40 5 048 805  (*) Title II does not include the subsidy of up to EUR 640 000 from the Greek authorities for the rent of the building.

ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2021 91  PART II. Management  d)  CARRY-FORWARD OF COMMITMENT  APPROPRIATIONS  The commitment appropriations corresponding to  the EU subsidy (C1 appropriations) that were not fully  paid at the end of 2020 were carried forward to 2021  (C8 appropriations).  Compared with 2020, there was a nearly  1 percentage point increase in payment execution  (96.55 % in 2021 compared with 95.86 % in 2020),  showing an improvement in financial management in  this regard.  4 DELEGATION AND SUB DELEGATION  At the end of 2020, in line with the reorganisation,  the Executive Director reviewed the delegation of  authorising authority powers and on 22 December  2020 adopted a new decision on a framework of the  financial delegation of the authorising officer.  This decision confirmed the financial delegations  applicable to heads of unit and permanent team  leaders with respective limits of EUR 400 000  and EUR 200 000 per transaction. ENISA did not  implement any further subdelegations in 2021.  Controls on these delegation rights are done through  a periodical revision of the rights granted in the main  financial system Accrual Based Accounting (ABAC) and  are shared on an annual basis with the Commission  (Directorate-General for Budget).  5 HUMAN RESOURCES MANAGEMENT  In 2020 the ENISA Management Board established  a structure for the Agency, set in place principles  under which the organisation should function, and  imposed guidelines for the proportional allocation  of resources between its operational units and  those that support the administrative and corporate  functions. On 1 January 2021, the new organisational  structure was in effect.  The HR sector continued to support the operational  and administrative goals of the Agency in terms of  staff acquisition and development. In 2021, ENISA  HR welcomed 31 newcomers (22 temporary agents,  5 contract agents, 3 seconded national experts and  1 trainee). ENISA’s workforce planning was for the  first time mapped by an Executive Director decision  (17/2021). The aim of this decision was to set the  basis for strategic workforce planning, which would  allow the Agency to proactively estimate, engage,  develop and align its HR with the evolving strategic  focus of its activities and objectives as directed by its  SPDs, the Management Board and Union legislation.  Following this decision, the Executive Director  promptly launched the 2021 strategic workforce  review by Decision No 28/2021.  In 2021, ENISA carried out tasks to support the  deployment of the Commission’s information  management system for HR, Sysper.  In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, in 2021  ENISA staff continued to telework. Staff guidelines  were drawn up and teleworking was authorised in  lieu of working in the office for all staff. The Agency  continued to exercise its duty of care and allow staff  members to take precautions based on numbers  of intensive care units available in each relevant  Member State. During the pandemic, daily updates  were sent to all staff members via a designated  functional mailbox, detailing the number of cases  and the most recent developments in the world,  so as to keep staff abreast of the latest news.  The following table shows the commitment execution and payment execution in 2021.  2021 budget (C8)  2021 area of budget  allocation  Appropriations carried forward  from 2020 to 2021 (EUR)  PAYMENT  AMOUNT (EUR)  Percentage  paid  Amount cancelled  (EUR)  Title I 1 209 759 1 135 981 93.90 73 779  Title II 1 762 732 1 672 080 94.86 90 651  Title III 3 102 500 3 057 545 98.55 44 955  TOTAL 6 074 991 5 865 606 96.55 209 385  9292  Compliance remained a priority for the HR unit  both in terms of meeting audit and internal control  recommendations and in terms of meeting statutory  requirements such as in the area of personal  data protection.  Implementing rules adopted  In 2021, ENISA adopted two European Commission  decisions: on a procedure for dealing with  professional incompetence, and on laying down  general implementing provisions on the conduct of  administrative inquiries and disciplinary proceedings.  Brief description of the results of the  screening/benchmarking exercise  ENISA continued in 2021 to partially apply the  benchmarking exercise following the European  Commission’s methodology. The third table in  Annex IV depicts the results of the exercise based  on the type of posts with regard to administrative  support and coordination, operational and neutral.  A slight increase can be observed in the type of posts  under ‘administrative support and coordination’ and  ‘neutral’ in comparison with 20203. The Management  Board set out a transition period for the Agency  within the 2022–2024 SPD based on the requirements  outlined in Article 3(3) of Management Board Decision  MB/2020/9, which direct the Executive Director  to take steps in order to ensure that the average  number of staff members assigned to the Executive  Director’s Office and the CSS does not exceed  the average number of staff member assigned to  operational units.  3 While the percentages in 2021 show a 'decrease' in the  operational figures, in reality the % of the operational  staff have increased not decreased, compared to 2019- 2020. The numbers reported under the old structure did  not reflect mandates of structural units accurately. The  numbers reported under the 2021 exercise did not take  fully into consideration the qualitative elements of the  Commission’s methodology which indicates, among others,  that structural entity takes precedence over the function of  the post (e.g. administrative function supporting operational  units are counted as operational roles as they provide  support of an operational nature), that the exact job purpose  of the post needs to be looked at when in doubt (e.g. HR  payroll is considered neutral and not administrative support  even though the role belongs in HR, while internal control  with emphasis on process is administrative support and not  neutral) or the reference to the legal act needs to be looked at  (how the job role fits under the Cybersecurity Act). The Agency  intends to rectify this exercise in 2022 by fully aligning with  the Commission methodology.  6 STRATEGY FOR GAINS IN EFFICIENCY  In 2021, the agency focused on implementing  internal gains in efficiency in various areas as per  the performance management roadmap.  Over the recording year, the reorganisation led to  a complete revision of its way of working for internal  decision-making. The Agency progressively optimised  its structure and working methods, and implemented  cost efficiency measures in its business model, for  example by introducing the Commission tools Sysper,  Mission Integrated processing system and ARES.  This led to an improvement in performance in various  areas but also to a strengthening of service continuity.  Furthermore, the implementation of several MoUs  and SLAs signed in 2020 and early 2021 led to close  cooperation with other EUIBAs, namely Cedefop,  eu-LISA, CERT-EU, the EDA and Europol. SLAs with  Commission services allow the Agency to optimise  its resources spent on administrative support. HR,  treasury services and the cybersecurity of ENISA’s IT  systems are supported through such SLAs.  In 2022 the Agency is actively seeking gains in efficiency  by developing an approach to sharing services with the  newly established European Cybersecurity Industrial,  Technology and Research Competence Centre4, in  particular in the area of administrative support.  7 ASSESSMENT OF AUDIT AND EX-POST  EVALUATION RESULTS DURING THE  REPORTING YEAR  7.1 Internal Audit Service (IAS)  The IAS audit report on HR management and ethics  was issued in September 2019. Three very important  and four important recommendations were issued  in this audit.  Although four recommendations were closed by the  IAS following the corrective actions implemented by  ENISA, three important recommendation remained  open at the end of 2021, which were not fully  implemented within the set time frame.  4 See Regulation (EU) 2021/887 of the European Parliament  and of the Council of 20 May 2021 establishing the  European Cybersecurity Industrial, Technology and  Research Competence Centre and the Network of National  Coordination Centres (https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/ EN/TXT/?qid=1623160399041&uri=CELEX%3A32021R0887).  https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?qid=1623160399041&uri=CELEX%3A32021R0887 https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?qid=1623160399041&uri=CELEX%3A32021R0887  ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2021 93  PART II. Management  They delays are mainly imputable to the  reorganisation of ENISA stemming from the  adoption of the CSA. To better address the new  challenges under this new regulatory framework,  ENISA, with a stronger mandate and increased  financial resources, was significantly reorganised and  restructured with effect from 1 January 2021.  This had the consequence that many internal  processes had to be rethought to fit the structure as  approved by the Management Board in June 2020,  and have introduced new ways of working.  This affected the roll-out of the corrective HR  plan as initially planned with the IAS in late 2019.  A new timeline to implement the three remaining  recommendations was agreed with the IAS.  In 2021 the IAS conducted an audit on strategic  planning programming and performance  management in ENISA and issued its final audit report  in April 2022, with three important recommendations  that ENISA commits to address in the course of 2022  and onwards.  7.2 European Court of Auditors  In 2021 the ECA issued its report on the 2020  annual accounts of the agency5. In the ECA’s opinion,  the accounts of the agency for the year ended  31 December 2020 present fairly, in all material  respects, the financial position of the agency at  31 December 2020, the results of its operations,  its cash flows and the changes in net assets for the  year then ended, in accordance with its financial  regulation and with accounting rules adopted by  the Commission’s accounting officer.  5 Available online (https://www.enisa.europa.eu/about-enisa/ accounting-finance/).  Moreover, payments underlying the accounts for the  year ended 31 December 2020 are legal and regular  in all material respects, except for a weakness in  the delegation of financial rights whereby financial  transactions had been authorised without proper  financial delegation rights in place. This led to the  ECA’s qualified opinion on the legality and regularity  of the payments underlying the accounts.  It is important to note that these financial  transactions did not affect the reliability of the  financial records: these transactions would have been  processed by the Agency anyway, as all of them were  free of conflict and completed in pursuance of the  Agency’s objectives and for its official use.  As already reported in the 2020 annual activity  report, the Agency welcomed this audit finding and  a corrective action plan was immediately devised  to address this legal issue and to reinforce relevant  internal controls.  An additional independent and specific report was  requested on this matter from ENISA’s external  auditors, Mazars, in late 2021. It confirmed that these  transactions were duly justified in pursuance of the  Agency’s objectives and for its official use.  Following up on previous ECA observations, ENISA  adopted a sensitive functions policy in 2021 (entering  into force in May 2022) and is still reducing its usage  of interim staff.  European Court of Auditors audit on cybersecurity  of EU institutions, bodies and agencies  The ECA conducted in 2021 an audit on the level  of cybersecurity preparedness of EUIBAs. The scope  of the audit included three main questions, on the  key cybersecurity practices adopted across EUIBAs,  the efficiency of cooperation between EUIBAs on  The table below shows ENISA’s planned recruitment goals for 2020 to 2021.  Area Objective 2021  performance  2020  target  2021  target  Efficient  management  of selection  procedures  Reduction of time taken to hire (in line with the  standard EU HR definition, this is the time frame  set from the deadline for candidates to submit  applications until the signing of the reserve list  by the Executive Director)  4 months ≤ 5 months ≤ 5 months  Turnover of staff Reduced turnover rate of statutory staff  (temporary agents and contract agents)  3 % < 15 % < 15 %  Staff performance  management  Implementation and monitoring of the appraisal  and reclassification exercises (launching and  completion of the exercises)  100 % 100 % 100 %  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/about-enisa/accounting-finance/ https://www.enisa.europa.eu/about-enisa/accounting-finance/  9494  cybersecurity, and the adequacy of the cybersecurity  support provided to EUIBAs by ENISA and CERT-EU.  ENISA was specifically surveyed by ECA to that end.  The final ECA audit report was published in March  20226. ENISA welcomed the recommendations and  observations of the report7, which highlight the key  roles that ENISA and CERT-EU can play in increasing  the level of cyber preparedness of EUIBAs and  underline the need for adequate resources to do so.  7.3 Ex-post control evaluation results  In 2021, ENISA performed ex-post controls of  financial transactions in accordance with the ENISA  financial regulation’s Article 45(8) and (9) for the  financial year 2020.  A total of 254 financial transactions were scrutinised,  representing 16.38 % of all the Agency’s financial  transactions and 80.38 % of the Agency’s budget.  Four recommendations were made and none of them  was critical. In particular, the financial delegations and  underlying financial circuit have since been revised  and its implementation has been taken effect as from  1st January 2021. Acknowledging the efforts made by  ENISA, the ECA has deemed that these weaknesses  have been properly addressed by ENISA as the  related observations have been flagged as completed  in its follow-up of previous year's observations in its  2021 annual audit report of the Agency.  8 FOLLOW UP OF RECOMMENDATIONS  AND ACTION PLANS FOR AUDITS AND  EVALUATIONS  As highlighted in Sections 2.7.1 and 2.7.2 above,  ENISA took the necessary steps to address the ECA  and IAS findings.  All recommendations from past audits have been  addressed, with the exception of the three remaining  important recommendations from the IAS 2019 audit  on HR management, which will be implemented in  accordance with the new agreed timeline.  6 Available online (https://www.eca.europa.eu/en/Pages/ DocItem.aspx?did=60922).  7 Available online (https://www.enisa.europa.eu/news/enisa- news/securing-eu-institutions-bodies-and-agencies).  9 FOLLOW-UP OF RECOMMENDATIONS  ISSUED FOLLOWING INVESTIGATIONS BY  THE EUROPEAN ANTI-FRAUD OFFICE  The recommendations issued by the European Anti- Fraud Office were endorsed by the Agency during  2021, following all the necessary steps provided in the  regulatory framework.  10 FOLLOW-UP OF OBSERVATIONS FROM  THE DISCHARGE AUTHORITY  In relation to the 2020 discharge, as decided by  the European Parliament, the Executive Director of  the Agency was granted discharge regarding the  implementation of the agency’s budget for the 2020  financial year. The closure of the Agency’s accounts  for the 2020 financial year was also approved by the  discharge authority.  In reply to observations and comments made by  the European Parliament in its discharge of 2020,  the Agency provided further information on actions  taken to address previously identified areas for  improvement and highlighted some actions taken  that are of interest to the European Parliament.  In particular:  the Agency took the necessary steps to mitigate  the weaknesses identified by the auditors by  strengthening its internal controls and updating its  internal processes for procurement procedures;  to better tackle the concerns on recruitment and  gender balance, ENISA redefined its recruitment  strategy as from 2020;  the sensitive post policy was adopted by the  Executive Director on 22 December 2021.  11 ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT  The Greek authorities concluded a lease agreement  on behalf of ENISA for its headquarters building in  Athens, which was fully operational as of 1 July 2021.  The building and office space are rented by the Greek  authorities for ENISA’s use. No longer occupying  a shared building will enable ENISA to set a wider set  of green measures to be implemented, as all electrical  systems such as heating/cooling/lighting will be  directly controlled by the agency, therefore enabling  it to directly monitor those systems and assess the  impact of any greening measures implemented.  During the set-up of the new office, the path to  https://www.eca.europa.eu/en/Pages/DocItem.aspx?did=60922 https://www.eca.europa.eu/en/Pages/DocItem.aspx?did=60922 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/news/enisa-news/securing-eu-institutions-bodies-and-agencies https://www.enisa.europa.eu/news/enisa-news/securing-eu-institutions-bodies-and-agencies  ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2021 95  PART II. Management  carbon neutrality was already visible. The agency  renovated the office space to better align with  operational needs and incorporate considerations  of greater energy savings and responsible  energy consumption.  12 ASSESSMENT BY MANAGEMENT  The achievement of the work programme was  far ahead of management’s expectations across  many areas thanks not only to the new streamlined  organisational structure, which mirrors the CSA and  ENISA’s strategy, but also to the additional processes  such as the inception and closure of projects by the  Management Team.  The introduction of inception and closure of all  operational projects by the Management Team  allowed for enhanced synergies and efficiencies  across the Agency, and ensured that stakeholders  were consulted to align the outcomes of the project  with their needs. Project managers were asked to  present their project plans according to a predefined  template of questions. The Management Team would  assess the projects objectives, the quality of the  plans and resources required, including stakeholders’  input into the scope of the project, after which the  Management Team provided its own input and the  project was approved for implementation. Project  closures followed a similar process, in which project  managers presented the outcome of the work to  the Management Team, including feedback from  stakeholders, after which the Management Team  provided input and the project was deemed delivered.  The achievement of the work programme has been  described in detail under each of the activities,  including the added value of each of the outputs.  PART II (B) EXTERNAL EVALUATIONS  In 2021, ENISA continued to follow up actions from the ex-post evaluation of 2019 performed by external  consultants. The key findings of the report were presented using the following criteria: effectiveness, efficiency,  coherence and coordination, relevance, and EU added value. These findings were followed by an action plan  composed of concrete recommendations to adjust and improve ENISA’s activities. Recommendations included  the reworking of KPIs, balancing and tailoring the agency’s activities and outputs, and finally reinforcing the  position of the Agency within the cybersecurity ecosystem.  To this end the Agency developed new KPIs and metrics to measure the performance of each of the activities.  These KPIs and metrics are being reported for the first time in the 2021 annual activity report and will be used  a basis for measuring performance in the years to come. The activities and outputs in the work programme of  the Agency are now aligned with the relevant articles of the CSA, thus providing a coherent way to measure the  performance of each activity against the mandate of the Agency.  96  III  ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2021 97  1 EFFECTIVENESS OF INTERNAL  CONTROL SYSTEMS  Internal control is established in the context of  ENISA’s fundamental budgetary principles and  associated with sound financial management. Internal  control is broadly defined in the Agency’s financial  regulation as a process designed to provide  reasonable assurance of achieving objectives. This  definition very much mirrors the standard definition  of internal control adopted by the Committee  of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway  Commission (COSO) (https://www.coso.org).  In this context, ENISA adopted its internal control  framework by Management Board Decision  MB/2019/12. It is based on the relevant framework  of the European Commission (which follows the  COSO framework) and includes five internal control  components and 17 internal control principles.  The five internal control components are the building  blocks that underpin the structure of the framework.  They are interrelated and must be present and  effective at all levels of ENISA for internal control  over operations to be considered effective.  Each component comprises one or more internal  control principles. Working with these principles  helps to provide reasonable assurance that  ENISA’s objectives have been met. The principles  specify the actions required for the internal control  to be effective.  In order to assess the components and principles  of the internal control framework, a set of 57  indicators has been adopted (as part of MB/2019/12).  The indicators are assessed individually and  supported by relevant evidence.  The assessment of the internal controls is an  important part of ENISA’s internal control framework,  which is conducted on an annual basis. For 2021,  this assessment was based on the indicators of the  framework, as well as additional information from  specific (risk) assessment reports, audit findings and  other relevant sources. The assessment also followed  the related guidance and templates developed under  the EU Agencies Performance Development Network.  1.1 Assessment of control environment  component  The control environment component consists of five  principles, as described below.  Principle 1: ENISA demonstrates commitment to  integrity and ethical values  The Agency promotes yearly training on ethics and  integrity. The management encourages all staff to  take these courses. In order to increase the level of  PART III ASSESSMENT OF  THE EFFECTIVENESS  OF THE INTERNAL  CONTROL SYSTEMS  https://www.coso.org  98  participation, the Agency will consider a diversity  of training plans/programmes to address different  levels of staff knowledge/maturity. Various types  of information material are at the disposal of the  staff, such as training content and the most up-to- date reports by the Commission’s Investigation and  Disciplinary Office. ENISA’s code of conduct, including  the code of good administrative behaviour, is due to  be published in 2022.  Principle 2: ENISA’s management exercises  responsibility for overseeing the development and  performance of internal control  The declaration of assurance of the Executive Director  is included in the annual activity report (Part V). All  authorising officers by delegation signed their own  declarations of assurance covering their areas.  Following the ECA’s 2020 audit finding (reported in  ENISA’s 2020 AAR) regarding the lack of delegation  for a staff member, the Agency took immediate  action in 2021 to assess if the use of ENISA’s financial  resources had respected the principle of sound  financial management, in particular in the context  of any situation giving rise to potential conflicts of  interests. In addition, corrective actions were taken  as regards the delegation of authorising officers and  relevant internal controls.  Principle 3: ENISA’s management establishes  structures, reporting lines, and appropriate  authorities and responsibilities in the pursuit  of objectives  Every month the Agency publishes on its intranet  the adopted and updated organisation charts.  The organisation charts are updated based on the  Agency’s overall objectives.  The Executive Director’s Decision 2020/146 on  delegation of authority, which entered into force on  1 January 2021, describes the financial circuits and  all financial delegations, ensuring a clear segregation  of duties. The specific decision limits the number  of authorising officers, covering all delegations of  financial transactions, streamlining the profiles and  enhancing efficiency and effectiveness. Importantly,  it includes a sunset clause to end all subdelegated  authority automatically three months after the  change of the person of the Executive Director, unless  the new Executive Director explicitly confirms the  delegations in place.  The IAS conducted an audit on strategic planning,  programming and performance management in  ENISA in 2021. According to the IAS draft audit report  (final report to be published in 2022), ENISA’s overall  management and control systems put in place for  strategic planning, programming and performance  management are adequately designed, and efficiently  and effectively implemented, and support the  Agency in achieving its business objectives. The three  potential inconsistencies that have been identified  by the IAS (in the areas of staff appraisal and  performance assessment, performance management  guidelines, and project management guidelines) will  be addressed under ongoing actions during 2022.  Principle 4: ENISA demonstrates commitment to  attracting, developing and retaining competent  individuals in alignment with its objectives  The publication of ENISA’s vacancy notices in  2021 was widely advertised via various channels  (including ENISA’s website and specific platforms such  as Euractiv).  The turnover of staff was low (3 %) in 2021, which  shows ENISA’s ability to retain staff members  in the Agency.  All staff members performed their CDRs within 2021;  the relevant dialogues were held between the staff  members and their line managers.  ENISA’s overall  management and  control systems put  in place for strategic  planning, programming  and performance  management are  adequately designed,  and efficiently  and effectively  implemented, and  support the Agency in  achieving its business  objectives.  ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2021 99  PART III. Assessment of the effectiveness of the internal control systems  In order to develop and retain competent individuals,  a learning and development policy is adopted every  year. This policy is detailed and includes the training  plan as well as the budgetary resources needed.  Internal mobility is available to all staff. Two  possibilities are offered to the staff. They can apply  for internal vacancies or request internal mobility  during the CDR exercise. In addition, staff members  had the possibility in 2021 of participating in the  horizontal teams, established under the new  organisational structure, which also constitutes  a form of internal mobility.  In 2021 a task force was established by the Executive  Director to review the large-scale recruitment  exercise of 2020 (temporary agents / contract agents /  heads of unit) with a view to establishing lessons  learned and providing resultant recommendations  for the future. The task force’s observations will be  further analysed and considered in the context of the  Agency’s broader recruitment policy.  Principle 5: ENISA holds accountable for their  internal control responsibilities in the pursuit  of objectives  The Agency reviews its annual objectives during  the year. While mid-term reviews are planned,  significant effort is put on into the ex-ante evaluation  and continuous monitoring of projects through the  weekly Management Team meetings. In particular,  each project starts with an inception, may be further  reviewed for guidance and then is finally presented  to the Management Team for closure. This ensures  a clear view and follow-up of the annual objectives  during the whole year.  In order to be able to deliver the amended or new  objectives, some job descriptions can be reviewed  when needed. In 2021, there was no revision of job  descriptions, as a detailed exercise was performed in  2020 during the Agency’s reorganisation.  The staff’s efficiency, abilities and conduct in  the service are assessed annually against the  expected standards of conducts and set objectives.  Promotion of staff is decided after consideration of  the comparative merits of eligible staff, taking into  account their appraisal reports.  1.2 Assessment of risk assessment  component  The risk assessment component consists of four  principles, as presented below.  Principle 6: ENISA specifies objectives with  sufficient clarity to enable the identification and  assessment of risks relating to objectives  On the basis of ENISA’s strategy, adopted in  2020, the Executive Director’s Decision 35/2020  on the internal structures was adopted, elaborating  in detail the mission statements of all units and  teams (amended by Decision 3/2022 to reflect the  latest organisational structure and consequent  mission statements).  In addition, the adoption of ENISA’s SPD is based  on input from all units and teams across the Agency,  and consultation with stakeholders, before being  formally adopted by the agency’s Management  Board. Throughout the year, the agency’s outputs are  incepted, reviewed and finalised in close consultation  with the stakeholders, including ENISA’s Management  Board, Advisory Group and NLO Network.  ENISA uses objectives as a basis for allocating  resources to achieve policy, operational and financial  performance goals. In 2021, the Agency’s budget  implementation rate was 99.51 %, while the budget  outturn was 98.57 %.  Principle 7: ENISA identifies risks to the  achievement of its objectives across the  organisation and analyses risks as a basis for  determining how the risks should be managed  ENISA identifies and assesses risks at the various  organisational levels, analysing internal and external  factors. Management and staff are involved in the  process at the appropriate level. ENISA estimates  the significance of the risks identified and determines  how to respond to significant risks, considering how  each one should be managed and whether to accept,  avoid, reduce or share the risk.  While risks are identified in the context of different  processes (during the inception/revision/finalisation  of projects, as part of the business continuity project,  in the yearly ICT security risk assessments, in the  assessment of sensitive functions, etc.), a holistic  centralised risk management approach has not yet  been implemented at Agency-wide level. To this  end, in 2022 ENISA will kick off the development  of a formalised enterprise risk management  methodology that will be used to consolidate risks  and contribute to the maintenance and continuous  updating of a central ENISA risk register.  100  Principle 8: ENISA considers the potential for fraud  in assessing risks to the achievement of objectives  The Agency’s anti-fraud strategy was updated in 2021  and formally adopted by Management Board Decision  MB/2021/5. All objectives and actions for 2021 were  delivered, with the exception of the code for good  administrative behaviour, which is due for 2022.  A dedicated web page was created on ENISA’s intranet  where all regulations, documents, training materials  and a toolbox are now available to all the staff.  The course in fraud prevention is part of the training  in ethics and integrity, and was delivered in 2021.  An advanced course on fraud prevention and  ENISA’s ant-fraud strategy was scheduled for 2022.  Principle 9: ENISA identifies and analyses  significant change  Change is managed via different processes within  the Agency. At operational level, continuous  monitoring of the work programme activities via  the weekly Management Team meetings enables  the identification and analysis of significant change  (thus enabling further reflection of this change in  internal activities). The establishment of dedicated  Committees (IT Management Committee, Budget  Management Committee, IPR Management  Committee) further supports change management  at corporate level. During the reporting year 2021,  change and subsequent risks have been managed in  this context, considering also changes arising from  the external environment, as for example the change  in tele-working conditions that was deemed necessary  within 2021, due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The  establishment of a comprehensive risk management  framework within 2022 will further enhance the  Agency’s possibilities to identify and manage change.  The maintenance of a centralised risk register is part  of this framework.  1.3 Assessment of control activities  component  The control activities component consists of three  principles, as presented below.  Principle 10: ENISA selects and develops control  activities that contribute to the mitigation of  risks to the achievement of objectives to an  acceptable level  Under the new ENISA organisational structure there  is continuous monitoring of performance, at both  the beginning (inception) and closure (finalisation) of  projects, as well as throughout the year with reporting  and/or validation at the weekly Management Team  meetings. In addition, both the scope and the  performance of the indicators are continuously  validated with external stakeholders, in particular  the NLO Network and ENISA’s Advisory Group, as  well as various ad hoc working groups established in  different thematic areas.  In order to ensure a high level of control, the Agency  applies ex-ante verification to 100 % of its financial  transactions. In order to complete this control, an  ex-post control verification is performed every year.  In 2021, a sample of 254 transactions was selected,  following ENISA’s relevant policy/guidelines for  ex-post verification. These transactions represent  80.38 % of the total by value and 16.38 % by volume.  Roles and responsibilities are being reviewed within  the Agency with a view to ensure segregation of  duties where needed. Identified weakness identified  by the European Court of Auditors in the area of  internal controls has been addressed through  the reorganisation. Another area that requires  risk mitigation is the ENISA Financial sector that  is currently led by the acting Head of Sector who  is also in charge for accounting and compliance.  A new recruitment is planned in the course of 2022.  While controls were integrated into different  processes (e.g. inception process, validation with  stakeholders, management committees), the holistic  internal control assessment was not fully formalised  at Agency-wide level. In addition, further development  of the Agency’s business continuity plan is needed.  The internal control framework assessment for  2021 provided specific recommendations to address  these elements.  In 2021, the sensitive functions policy was adopted by  the Executive Director’s Decision 2021/86 (entering  into force in May 2022). The decision provides a high- level methodology for defining the sensitive functions  at ENISA, together with broad categories of mitigation  measures that can be applied to manage the risks.  Following the adoption of the decision, the first risk  assessment of the Agency’s sensitive functions was  conducted by the Executive Director’s Office in March  2022. This risk assessment defined the sensitive  functions at Agency level. The risk assessment  (methodology and result) was endorsed by  ENISA’s Management Team in March 2022.  ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2021 101  PART III. Assessment of the effectiveness of the internal control systems  Principle 11: ENISA selects and develops  general control over technology to support the  achievement of objectives  In 2021, following a proposal by ENISA’s ITMC, the  Agency adopted its IT strategic framework, which  also covers information security at strategic level. In  addition, following the Commission’s draft proposal  for the regulations on common binding cybersecurity  rules and on information security, a process for  reviewing the agency’s IT security framework was  initiated and will be continued in 2022.  Every year, the Agency performs an IT security risk  assessment (under the control of ENISA’s Information  Security Officer). The IT security risk assessment was  concluded in 2021. A broader IT risk assessment,  however, including a business continuity plan, was  not conducted at the Agency. Still, a register of all  IT systems at the Agency (and their owners) was  created, as part of ENISA’s IT strategy.  The Agency uses a register in which security  incidents and personal data breaches are recorded.  In particular, each security incident or personal  data breach is documented in the register based on  specific incident-reporting templates (including date,  description of incident, those involved, causes, risk  assessment and actions taken).  In 2021 there was one incident that was assessed  as potentially being of high risk. In particular, in  July 2021, due to the exploitation of a zero-day  vulnerability, unauthorised access was obtained to  a number of mailboxes of the Agency’s corporate  email server. The incident did not affect any other  corporate or operational system of ENISA and did  not pose any threat to ENISA’s operational mandate.  Once the incident was identified, ENISA, in co- operation with CERT-EU and competent authorities,  conducted a full forensic investigation. The findings  have been shared with all relevant parties and  Member States. ENISA took immediate actions to  contain the event and assess its impact.  All necessary  actions were taken in compliance with the Regulation  (EU) 1725/2018, including the timely notification of  the European Data Protection Supervisor.  In addition, an internal Task Force was created to  establish the technical facts that led to the incident.  The Task Force report, which was submitted to the  ED on December 2021, demonstrated a number of  gaps in the IT governance at ENISA, as well as in the  related IT policy and procedural framework. The task  force recommended a number of corrective actions  to that end (action plan), which were endorsed by the  Agency’s Management Team and further presented to  and adopted by the ENISA’s Management Board. The  action plan includes specific timelines and responsible  actors within ENISA for all foreseen actions.  Principle 12: ENISA deploys control activities  through policies that establish what is expected  and in procedures that put policies into action  In 2021, the majority of recommendations stemming  from the IAS performance audits were addressed and  submitted to IAS. However, there are still some open  findings to be addressed in 2022.  The Agency keeps its register of exceptions updated  on a yearly basis. There is a dedicated workflow  in Paperless to report an exception. The workflow  contain the link to the form that needs to be filled in  by those responsible for the exception.  For 2021, three exceptions are reported herein, none  of them of a critical nature, as follows.  1.  While the timelines of the staff appraisal exercise  were respected, there was a delay in the timeline  for reclassification; in particular, the appeal  period had to be shortened by 5 working days,  which is a deviation from the Agency’s relevant  rule (MB/10/16), which allows 10 working days  for staff members to appeal. The delay was due  to additional validation of the data, which was  necessary in order to meet ENISA’s obligations and  ensure an equal and fair comparison of merits for  all ENISA staff.  2.  A service contract for cleaning services for the  amount of EUR 28 000 was awarded directly  (extension of the service with the same contractor),  instead of launching a procurement procedure.  The exception was necessary for business  continuity purposes and did not expose the agency  to any serious legal risk.  In order to ensure  a high level of control,  the Agency applies  ex-ante verification to  100 % of its financial  transactions.  102  3.  In 2021, the Agency paid the amount of  EUR 18 800 and committed an additional amount  of EUR 24 900 (equivalent to a total expenditure  of EUR 43 700) for Greek value added tax (VAT),  which was not exempted by the local Greek  administration in due time. This issue mainly  relates to invoices issued before 2020 for which  the non-exemption of VAT was identified only  in 2021. The VAT exemption process has since  been revised to improve its monitoring by  processing digital copies instead of using hard  copies, which left an insufficient audit trail of the  work performed.  The Agency performs a yearly external ex-post  evaluation of its activities based on the effectiveness,  efficiency, coherence, coordination and added value  of its activities.  1.4 Assessment of information and  communication component  The information and communication component  consists of three principles, as presented below.  Principle 13: ENISA obtains or generates and  uses relevant quality information to support the  functioning of internal control  The Agency registers and archives all its official  documents (outgoing and incoming) in a specific  registration system. In 2021 the Agency kicked off  its migration to the ARES registration system of the  European Commission. The completion of this project  is expected in 2022.This new development supports  the principle of single administration (same tools and  processes used by staff internally) within ENISA.  ENISA uses various tools for internal communications.  The most common tools are ENISA’s intranet, email,  Skype for Business and WebEx.  The Agency can retrieve 100 % of the documents  requested by the IAS/ECA. All documents are archived  in ENISA’s intranet, Paperless and financial report  requests using Business Object and ABAC.  Principle 14: ENISA communicates internally  the information, including objectives and  responsibilities for internal control, that  is necessary to support the functioning  of internal control  There is transparency in the Agency regarding  objectives, challenges, actions taken or to be taken,  and results achieved. The minutes of the weekly  Management Team meetings minutes are made  available by email to all staff. In addition, weekly  question and answer sessions for all staff on different  aspects of the new MIPorganisation were organised  throughout 2021.  Mid-term reviews are used to communicate  objectives achieved and ongoing, while substantial  effort is put into ex-ante evaluation of the projects,  starting with a detailed inception proposed during  the Management Team meetings. The same  projects may then be reviewed for guidance during  the Management Team meetings and will then be  presented to the Management Team for finalisation.  This ensures a clear view and follow-up of the annual  objectives during the year.  There is a separate communication line for  whistleblowing arrangements. The basic principles,  definitions and reporting mechanism are described in  ENISA’s whistleblowing policy.  Principle 15: ENISA communicates with external  parties about matters affecting the functioning  of internal control  The Agency’s press coverage is monitored monthly  and quarterly, detailing the media used. The most  recent corporate communication strategy is from May  2021. While certain actions under the communication  strategy have been endorsed at Management  Team level, the Agency is also working to provide  the new stakeholder strategy (to take effect during  2022). The awareness raising and education team  actively cooperates with the communication  sector (under the Executive Director’s Office)  on ENISA’s stakeholder strategy.  The Agency communicates about its internal control  matters through the annual activity report.  1.5 Assessment of monitoring activities  component  The monitoring activities component consists of two  principles, as presented below.  Principle 16: ENISA obtains or generates and  uses relevant quality information to support the  functioning of internal control  ENISA continuously monitors the performance of  the internal control system with tools that make  it possible to identify internal control deficiencies,  register and assess the results of controls, and control  deviations and exceptions.  ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2021 103  PART III. Assessment of the effectiveness of the internal control systems  The Agency follows up, in a timely manner, the  recommendations of the auditors, as well as risks  identified in the ex-ante and ex-post controls and  relevant evaluations. While four recommendations  were closed by the IAS during 2021, following the  corrective actions implemented by ENISA, three  important recommendations remain open and have  not been fully implemented within the set time frame.  The delays are mainly imputable to the reorganisation  of ENISA stemming from the adoption of the CSA.  This affected the roll-out of the HR corrective  plan as initially planned with the IAS in late 2019.  A new timeline to implement the three remaining  recommendations was agreed with the IAS.  Principle 17: ENISA assesses internal control  deficiencies and communicates them in a timely  manner to those parties responsible for taking  corrective action, including senior management  as appropriate  The deficiencies are communicated to the parties  responsible and to the Management Team. Mitigation  measures are addressed immediately. They are  planned and have a date for implementation. The  Agency follows up these deadlines closely as well as  the result of the mitigation measures proposed.  2 CONCLUSIONS OF ASSESSMENT OF  INTERNAL CONTROL SYSTEMS  The overall assessment shows that the internal  controls at ENISA provide reasonable assurance  that policies, processes, tasks and behaviours of the  Agency, taken together, facilitate its effective and  efficient operation, help to ensure the quality of  internal and external reporting, and help to ensure  compliance with its regulations. That being said, some  improvements are needed in certain principles, in  order to increase effectiveness and ensure proper  implementation of the internal controls in the future.  These improvements include the refinement of the  Agency’s internal control framework indicators, the  establishment of an enterprise risk management  framework, the revision of the IT governance and  underlying policy and procedural framework, the  revision of the Agency’s recruitment policy, as well the  update of the Agency’s Business Continuity Plan, The  follow up on these improvements will be assessed for  the next mid-term review of the Agency.  3 STATEMENT OF THE INTERNAL  CONTROL COORDINATOR IN CHARGE  OF RISK MANAGEMENT AND INTERNAL  CONTROL  I, the undersigned,  manager in charge of risk management and internal  control within the European Union Agency for  Cybersecurity (ENISA),  in my capacity as manager in charge of risk  management and internal control, declare that, in  2021 risk management and internal controls was  responsibility of the Executive Directors Office and  this area was identified in problem analysis that led  to reorganisation of ENISA effective as of 2021. In  accordance with ENISA’s internal control framework,  I have reported my advice and recommendations on  the overall state of internal control in the Agency to  the Executive Director.  I hereby certify that the information provided in the  present consolidated annual activity report and in its  annexes is, to the best of my knowledge, accurate,  reliable and complete.  Athens, 30th June 2022  Ingrida Taurina  104  IV  ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2021 105  1 REVIEW OF THE ELEMENTS  SUPPORTING ASSURANCE  The declaration of assurance, provided by the  authorising officer, is mainly based on the following  three pillars:  1.  regular monitoring of the KPIs set for operational,  administrative and financial tasks through the  formal periodical management reporting;  2.  effectiveness of the internal controls and  processes to detect weaknesses and to identify  areas for improvement;  3.  assessment and reports from independent bodies  (external evaluators, financial auditors (ECA,  complemented by a private audit firm), internal  auditors (IAS), etc.).  As highlighted in the previous sections, by the  operational, administrative and financial KPIs, and  by the positive opinion of the ECA on the reliability  of the accounts and on the legality and regularity  of the transactions underlying the accounts, and as  no critical observations have been formulated by  the IAS, the management has sufficient assurance  that ENISA is adequately managed to safeguard its  financial resources and to pursue the tasks which it  was entrusted with.  2 RESERVATIONS  Considering the results of the 2021 annual audits  performed by the ECA and the IAS, the 2021 results  of the internal controls (ex-post controls, review of  the register of exceptions, internal control framework  assessment) and the 2021 results of the key financial  and operational indicators, the authorising officer can  conclude that ENISA operated in 2021 in such a way  as to manage the risks appropriately.  In addition, the authorising officer has reasonable  assurance that the allocated resources were used for  their intended purpose, in compliance with the legal  framework and in accordance with the principle of  sound financial management.  PART IV MANAGEMENT  ASSURANCE  106  V  ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2021 107  PART V DECLARATION  OF ASSURANCE  I, the undersigned,  Juhan LEPASSAAR,  Executive Director of the European Union Agency for Cybersecurity,  in my capacity as authorising officer,  declare that the information contained in this report gives a true and fair8 view of the state of the Agency’s  affairs, and state that I have reasonable assurance that the resources assigned to the activities described in  this report have been used for their intended purpose and in accordance with the principles of sound financial  management, and that the control procedures put in place give the necessary guarantees concerning the legality  and regularity of the underlying transactions.  This reasonable assurance is based on my own judgement and on the information at my disposal, such as the  results of the self-assessment, ex-post controls, the work of the internal audit capability, the observations of the  Internal Audit Service and the lessons learned from the reports of the Court of Auditors for years prior to the  year of this declaration.  I confirm that I am not aware of anything not reported here that could harm the interests of the Agency.  Athens, 30th June 2022  Juhan LEPASSAAR  Executive Director  8 True and fair in this context means reliable, complete and accurate.  108  A  ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2021 109  KPI Metric  Unit (of

The allocation was determined according to the direct  budget and number of FTEs reported for each activity, with the indirect budget being assigned based on drivers  such as direct FTEs.  The following assumptions were used in the simplified activity-based costing methodology.  •  The direct budget is the actual cost of each of the nine operational activities described in Part I of this CAAR  in terms of services, goods, and missions.  •  The indirect budget is the actual cost of salaries and allowances, buildings, IT, equipment and miscellaneous  operating costs attributable to each activity. The indirect budget was allocated to activities based on drivers.  The main driver for cost allocation was the number of direct FTEs used for each operational activity in 2021.  •  For the purpose of the allocation of human and financial resources, an Executive Director’s Office activity  (Activity 10 as described in Part I) (budget and FTEs), which includes coordination, compliance, communication  and administration, was allocated to all of the Agency’s operational activities.  •  For the purpose of the allocation of human and financial resources, a Corporate Support Service activity  (Activity 11 as described in Part I), including HR, IT services, procurement and finance, facilities and logistics,  was allocated to all of the Agency’s operational activities.

In accordance with the provisions of the Seat agreement (Greek law 4627/2019) concluded with the Greek  authorities, ENISA received a contribution of EUR 219 110 to cover the 2021 leasing expenditure on its offices.  Active service-level agreements in 2021:  • with Cedefop for the purposes of increasing cooperation and sharing services between the two agencies;  •  with the Body of European Regulators for Electronic Communications for the provision of electronic data  backup services;  • with the European Food Safety Authority for a shared support office under the EU Agencies Network;  • with the European Union Intellectual Property Office for disaster recovery services.  132132  ANNEX 7 ENVIRONMENTAL  MANAGEMENT The normal activities of the Agency were materially affected by the fallout related to COVID-19 for the majority  of 2021. ENISA continued to implement, to the greatest extent allowed by its infrastructure and location, its  established greening measures such as recycling of office materials, reduction in electricity usage for lighting  and heating/cooling, the use of videoconferencing equipment instead of face-to-face meetings involving  travel, the use of teleworking, provision of bicycle racks to promote bicycling, the use of public transport and  implementing green public procurement.  Owing to restrictions imposed for the best part of 2021, such as 50 % teleworking for staff and restricted travel  for work, there were many areas in which significant benefits were realised with regard to adopting a more  environmentally friendly workplace. With the majority of staff teleworking 50 % from home, the carbon footprint  of each staff member was significantly reduced; they eschewed EU-wide business travel in favour of video  conferencing meetings instead; printing at the office was substantially reduced.  The Greek authorities concluded a lease agreement on behalf of ENISA for its headquarters building in  Athens, which was fully operational as of 1 July 2021. The building and office space are rented by the Greek  authorities for ENISA’s use. No longer occupying a shared building will enable a wider set of green measures  to be implemented, as all electrical systems such as heating/cooling/lighting will be directly controlled by the  Agency, therefore enabling it to directly monitor those systems and assess the impact of any greening measures  implemented. During the set-up of the new office, the path to carbon neutrality was already visible. The Agency  renovated the office space to better align with operational needs and incorporate considerations of more  efficient energy savings and responsible energy consumption.  The European Commission has determined that all sectors of the economy, including all EU institutions and  bodies, must contribute to making Europe become the first climate neutral continent by 2050. With this goal,  ENISA embraced the EU’s climate targets to ensure the climate neutrality of its operations by 2030.  ENISA will thus finally be able to commence assessment and initial planning for implementation  of the eco-management and audit scheme certification (EMAS) for its new main office building.  2022 will be a milestone for the agency on the path to carbon neutrality as it engages in the eco-management  and audit scheme for the first time, and expects to take action such as sourcing renewable energy and offsetting  emissions from work-related travel by staff members and visitors to ENISA premises.

In terms of cybersecurity challenges, it also proved to be the second year of living with the pandemic  and a prelude to the first year of Russia’s unprovoked and illegal war on Ukraine, whose cyber dimension started  far earlier than the actual invasion and is likely to outlive the atrocities of the current physical confrontation.  As an agency, I believe we have learned quickly and have adapted well to both of these external shocks.  The same year showed that we were able to deliver on ENISA’s strategic objectives, pursuing a resilient and  clear path towards making Europe more cybersecure, as well as adapting our activities to these changing  circumstances. Knowing that the political leadership in the EU and in the Member State prioritises cybersecurity  continues to be a real boost for the work and motivation of the Agency. The Agency fully carried out its mandate  and tasks fully to step up and support the Union by way of the following activities executed in 2021.  The adoption and implementation of policy frameworks is one key response area where the EU is making  a difference. Indeed, the policies and initiatives to be put in place in the coming years will determine how the  EU faces the cybersecurity challenges of today and tomorrow. Within this framework, ENISA supported Member  States with the technical aspects related to Directive (EU) 2016/1148 (the Network and Information security  directive (NISD)), and supported the European Parliament and Commission with regard to negotiations on  a revised NISD (NISD2) by providing technical expertise through written contributions on supply chain and on  the security requirements of the new sector. As connectivity and interdependencies between sectors grow, the  proposed expansion of scope under the new NISD2 will cover more sectors and entities, will incentivise these  to take better cybersecurity measures and will help fill the persistant gaps, for example in the area of incident- reporting practices. The NISD2 negotiations between the European Parliament and the Council of the European  Union have shown a unique cross-party / cross-Member State consensus in favour of this world-leading  legislative approach.  The second ENISA network and information security investment study, published in 2021, showed that incentives  to invest properly in cybersecurity were still missing. The majority of operators of essential services and digital  service providers acknowledged a significant positive impact of the NISD, particularly in detecting information  security incidents. However, the implementation of the NISD did not necessarily result in substantial increases  in the cybersecurity budgets of organisations. There is still much room for improvement here.  The agency organised and co-organised a number of exercises to test decision-making, internal communication  and business continuity. These exercises go a long way in preparing to respond to cyberthreats and incidents,  raising resilience and increasing preparedness across the EU.  ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2021 7  In area of operational cooperation, ENISA continued to work closely with other European Union institutions,  bodies and agencies (EUIBAs), and we were recently reminded by the regular Court of Auditors report that this  is an area that needs closer attention. A new memorandum of understanding was signed with the Computer  Emergency Response Team for the EU Institutions, Bodies and Agencies (CERT-EU) leveraging on the structured  collaboration in accordance with the Cybersecurity Act. The annual plan included activities to further develop  the Blueprint. ENISA and CERT-EU have aligned actions on developing EUIBA standard operating procedures and  improving the Union’s common situational awareness.  2021 also saw ENISA further its operational cooperation mandate by working with Member States to consolidate  cyber situational awareness analyses with a focus on cyber incidents in the EU and also the impact of incidents  from across the world on Europe. ENISA’s cyber situational awareness services were provided to EUIBAs and  authorities in Member States’ authorities through regular weekly reports and ad hoc threat research. In the context  of the Joint Cyber Unit initiative, ENISA organised a dedicated workshop to tackle the challenges in this area.  In relation to the EU cybersecurity certification framework, in 2021 ENISA prepared a candidate scheme on  European common criteria (EUCC) for cybersecurity certification scheme. Once adopted, this will become the  first EU scheme of its kind. In 2022 the candidate scheme on European cloud services will also be submitted  following tough talks in the ENISA working group. Furthermore, an ad hoc working group began working in 2021  to prepare a candidate certification scheme for 5G networks. Finalising the candidate schemes for specialised  product categories under the EUCC scheme and for cloud services is just the first step, and it is likely to bring  about benefits in terms of recognition and trust across government services, business and citizens.  The publication of the 9th edition of ENISA’s annual threat landscape report1 confirmed current and future trends  that cyberattacks are becoming ever more sophisticated, targeted, widespread, unattributable and detected too  late. These continue to be global trends and their impact was felt in Europe as anywhere else. Cybercriminals are  increasingly motivated by monetisation of their activities such as ransomware, the focus of the 9th ENISA threat  landscape report. In addition, supply chain attacks of a highly sophisticated and impactful nature proliferated, as  highlighted by the dedicated ENISA threat landscape on supply chains.  ENISA worked closely with the European Cybersecurity Competence Centre (ECCC) on the set-up phase and  engaged in discussions with the centre in relation to joint administrative services. ENISA identified research  and innovation needs and priorities in the field of life science cryptography, artificial intelligence and  hyperconnectivity, with the goal of preparing future funding priorities for the ECCC. As a permanent observer on  the governing board, ENISA played an active part in the activities of the Competence Centre. ENISA endeavoured  to ensure that relevant synergies could be developed, and to provide relevant input during the preparation of the  ECCC agenda, work programmes and multiannual work programme.  Russia’s war in the Ukraine has once again made clear that ENISA cannot operate in an EU vacuum. That is why  we equipped ourselves with an international strategy in late 2021 to offer more focused support to the Union  when it comes to addressing countries outside the Union.  The Agency reorganisation initiated in 2020 took full effect in 2021. The new internal organisation was designed  to be aligned with the requirements of the Cybersecurity Act and with the strategic objectives and priorities of  the newly developed strategy. The new structure was meant to ensure more effective implementation of the  tasks defined in our now permanent mandate to steadily move towards ‘a trusted and cybersecure Europe’2.  The Agency developed new key performance indicators and accompanying metrics during the reporting year,  which served to improve the reporting of the 11 activities of the present annual activity report.  I am very proud to report that, thanks to the alignment of the Agency’s structure with the Cybersecurity Act,  I can see now how all staff members and associated parties of the Agency performed their tasks and exercised  their related duties in a more coherent and coordinated manner, thus better serving the objectives of the  Agency’s mission. There is no doubt that a lot of work remains to be done and that fine-tuning will be needed  1 ENISA, ENISA Threat Landscape 2021 – April 2020 to mid-July 2021, 27 October 2021  (https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/enisa-threat-landscape-2021).  2 ENISA strategy - https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/corporate-documents/a-trusted-and-cyber-secure-europe-enisa-strategy  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/enisa-threat-landscape-2021 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/corporate-documents/a-trusted-and-cyber-secure-europe-enisa-strategy  8  over the coming years to adjust to our very fast-developing cybersecurity world and the inevitable challenges  associated with it.  In the meantime, I see the success of the 2021 work programme as a testimony to the capacity of the new  structure of the Agency to gather all the required synergies to deliver its mandate in the most effective way.  Thanks to the support of the Greek authorities, the Agency planned, prepared and moved to its new  headquarters building in Chalandri, Athens, ensuring minimal disruption to its operations.  This is why I cannot be thankful enough to all our stakeholders who contributed to these endeavours in 2021  and without whom ENISA could not deliver its work and support the cybersecurity communities of the EU.  I remain grateful for the ever so fruitful cooperation we enjoyed with our communities, with the European  institutions and bodies, and, last but not least, with each Member State of the EU .  I also feel very grateful for the renewed commitment of ENISA’s staff, including the 31 newcomers whom the agency  welcomed in 2021. It is a great satisfaction to me to see how they continued to welcome and embrace our tasks and  challenges in such a positive spirit. This is obviously the motivation we need to trigger if we want to successfully achieve  our vision of a trusted and secure Europe.  Juhan Lepassaar Executive Director, ENISA  ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2021 9  1  ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2021 111  Analyses and assessment by the management board  of ENISA of the Annual Activity Report for the year  2021 of the authorising officer of ENISA  The Management Board takes note of the  consolidated Annual Activity Report (AAR) for the  financial year 2021, submitted by the Executive  Director of the European Union Agency for  Cybersecurity (ENISA) in accordance with Article 48  of the Financial Regulation applicable to ENISA.  The Executive Board received a copy of the draft AAR  2021 produced by the Executive Director of ENISA in  his role as Authorising Officer for the implementation  of the annual budget on 11 May 2022 and the  Management Board received a copy of the draft AAR  2021 on 2 June 2022.  The Management Board performed the analysis  of the AAR and completed its assessment.  The conclusions of the Management Board are  the following:  The 2021 AAR represents the first full year when  ENISA’s new strategy (adopted by the Management  Board in June 2020) and its renewed Work  Programme were operational. In addition, structural  changes were introduced in 2021 for the effective  execution of ENISA’s mandate and strategy. A new  organisational structure was approved by the  Management Board in 2020, effective as of the  1st January 2021.  The challenging circumstances around the COVID  19 pandemic continued well into 2021 that required  the Agency to adjust its meetings to the online  environment and continuation of 50% office / 50%  teleworking arrangements for staff.  The Agency was able to meet the objectives set  in the work programme 2021 as shown by the  results presented in the report.  The AAR presents key results of the implementation of  the ENISA work programme 2021 thus demonstrating  how the Agency successfully completed all outputs  as agreed with the Management Board in the work  programme 2021.  ENISA involved stakeholder in the scoping and  validation of all outputs in the work programme  2021, ensuring the added-value and take-up of ENISA  deliverables by stakeholders, whether reports, tools,  workshops or recommendations.  Newly formulated key performance indicators  were reported in the AAR. These indicators provide  quantitative and qualitative assessment of each of the  operational and corporate activities and will be used  as a baseline for future years.  Overall, the AAR is in line with the ENISA work  programme 2021 and ENISA’s work is well aligned  with the overall European Union priorities for the  Digital Single Market. A coherent link is provided  ENISA MANAGEMENT  BOARD ASSESSMENT  12  between activities planned in the work programme  2021 and the actual achievements reached in the  reporting period.  The AAR also describes how ENISA managed its  resources and presents the budget execution of the  EU subsidy. In the course of 2021, the Agency has  been operating with a budget of EUR 23.5 million  equivalent to an 8% increase in 2021 compared to the  2020 budget (EUR 21.7 million)  During 2021, ENISA committed a total amount of  EUR 22 721 149 representing 99.51 % of the total  budget for the year. Payments made during the year  amounted to EUR 17 672 344 representing 77.40%  of the total budget. The execution of the budget  has been high despite the restrictive circumstances  imposed by COVID-19.  As compared to 2020, there has been a slight increase  in the execution of commitments, 99.51% in 2021  as compared to 97.35% in the previous year, and  an increase in the execution of payments, 77.40%  as compared to 68.62% in 2020. The target of a  95% for commitment rate set by the Commission  (DG Budget) was reached.  The turnover of staff was greatly reduced in 2021.  The ratio was only 3% which shows improvement  in retaining staff members in the Agency.  Furthermore, a combined recruitment procedure  organised in 2020 allowed the Agency to progress  rapidly in fulfilling its establishment plan with 31 new  recruits welcomed in 2021.  The AAR also provides information on the internal  control assessment for 2021. This section notes the  main categories of deviation that led to exceptions  reported. In 2021 the Agency reported three  exceptions in the AAR. None of these exceptions  has a serious impact for the Agency.  ENISA adopted the revised internal control framework  at the end of 2019. The AAR 2021 shows the adequate  management of risks, a high level of transparency,  clear governance structures and improved  performance monitoring.  The Management Board notes that infringement  of the use of delegation powers and weaknesses in  internal controls framework were identified by the  European Court Auditors. The Board concludes that  necessary actions were undertaken within 2021 to  improve the overall efficiency of the Agency in abiding  to its principles and congratulates ENISA for all the  efforts engaged to that end.  The annexes complete the AAR with a declaration  of assurance of the Executive Director as well as  additional information on human and financial  resources, draft annual accounts and financial  reports, as well as performance information  included in evaluations.  Overall, the Management Board takes note of the  successful achievements of ENISA in 2021. The  Management Board notes with satisfaction that ENISA  was able to deliver the work programme 2021 despite  the continued conditions due to COVID -19 showing  exceptional flexibility and efficiency in challenging  circumstances. The Management Board expresses  its deep appreciation to the Executive Director and  his staff for their commitment and the excellent  performance throughout the year.  In light of the above assessment, the Management  Board requests the Management Board Secretariat  to forward the AAR, together with this assessment, to  the European Commission, the European Parliament,  the Council, the Permanent Representations of the  Member States and the Court of Auditors.  ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2021 13  INTRODUCTION  1  ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2021 151  Implementation of the agency’s annual work  programme and highlights of the year  The mission of the European Union Agency for  Cybersecurity (ENISA) is to achieve a high common  level of cybersecurity across the Union in cooperation  with the wider community. To do so, the Agency acts  as a centre of expertise on cybersecurity, and collects  and provides independent, high-quality technical  advice and assistance to Member States and EU  bodies. ENISA is committed to strengthening trust in  the connected economy, boosting the resilience of  and trust in the Union’s infrastructure and services,  and keeping our society and citizens digitally  secure. The Agency therefore strives to be an agile,  environmentally and socially responsible organisation  focused on people.  The Cybersecurity Act (CSA) has now been  implemented for two years since it came into force  in 2019. 2020 was the first full year the Agency  functionned under the new organisation structure  which aligns with the new mandate and the newly  formed strategy.  The task assigned to ENISA under this regulation is to  achieve a high common level of cybersecurity across  the Union, including actively supporting Member  States, and Union institutions, bodies, offices and  agencies, in improving cybersecurity.  In the area of policy ENISA supported the  development of new policy files such as the  revised Network and Information Security directive  (NISD2), the Digital Operational Resilience Act  (DORA), electronic identification, authentication  and trust services (eIDAS), the European Electronic  Communications Code, 5G, digital wallets, artificial  intelligence (AI) and the Network CODE on cyber  security (NCCS). ENISA’s work in these areas delivers  evidence to inform future policy decisions with  a view to strengthening the EU policy and regulatory  framework to address cybersecurity challenges.  ENISA continued its efforts in supporting Member  States with technical aspects related to Directive  (EU) 2016/1148 (the network and information  security directive (NISD)), security of electronic  communications, data protection, privacy, electronic  identification, trust services, incident reporting  and vulnerability disclosure policies. It continued  its support of established groups, such as the NIS  Cooperation Group, its work streams, European  Competent Authorities for Security of Electronic  Communications Group and the ENISA eIDAS  regulation Article 19 expert group. A key highlight  is the support ENISA provided in relation to the  review of the NISD and the proposal for new sectors.  Furthermore, ENISA contributed to the ongoing  development of additional policy files, such as on  DORA, AI and Network CODE on cyber security (NCCS).  EXECUTIVE SUMMARY  16  In 2021, ENISA contributed to the improvement of  capabilities of Member States and EU institutions,  bodies and agencies (EUIBAs), raising resilience and  increasing preparedness across the EU. Capacity  across the Union was built by the organisation and  the setting up of several exercises, including Cyber  Europe, the Blueprint Operational Level Exercise  and CyberSOPEx, as well as in-depth training and  accompanying tabletop exercises in support of the  maturity and skills of computer security incident  response teams (CSIRTs) and other communities.  In addition, the Agency assisted Member States in  measuring the maturity level of national cybersecurity  strategies by developing an online tool to assist  Member States to perform a self-assessment exercise  with the aim of improving national cybersecurity  capabilities by conducting an evaluation of their  national cybersecurity capabilities, enhancing  awareness of the country’s maturity level and  identifying areas for improvement in building  cybersecurity capabilities.  During 2021, ENISA supported and coordinated  a number of networks and technical/operational  communities. ENISA supported the activities of the  CSIRTs Network in implementing the network’s work  programme for 2021, and aided the networks during  high-profile incidents that required escalation,  such as during the Member States exchange Log4j  vulnerability. ENISA actively supported the newly  established Cyber Crisis Liaison Network (CyCLONe)  by carrying out activities designed to improve  information sharing and operational cooperation,  in particular regarding automated reporting, impact  assessment and situational awareness. ENISA  also engaged in the initial activities related to the  proposal for a Joint Cyber Unit by contributing to  and organising several workshops. All these activities  helped to identify best practices, challenges and  opportunities with a view to improving operational  cooperation, situational awareness and coordination  for incident response in the EU.  Moreover, ENISA contributed to the development  of effective operational cooperation among Member  States and EUIBAs by generating and consolidating  information (including from the general public) on  cyber situational awareness, technical situational  reports (threat reports), incident reports and threats.  ENISA also actively supported the consolidation and  exchange of information on strategic, tactical and  technical levels to operational communities, such  as the CSIRTs Network and CyCLONe.  In the area of certification, ENISA had made  meaningful contributions to the EU cybersecurity  certification framework; it had shifted from one  mature scheme to two and it had a third one in the  works. ENISA started populating the cybersecurity  market analysis area, and redirected standardisation  to fit its dual purpose across cybersecurity policy  and cybersecurity certification, while developing  its relationship with European standardisation  organisations yet further. ENISA assisted the  Commission with regard to cybersecurity certification  bodies – the European Cybersecurity Certification  Group (ECCG) and Stakeholder Cybersecurity  Certification Group – and continued developing its  capability to service the Commission and the Member  States on cybersecurity certification by producing  guidance on the candidate cybersecurity certification  scheme on European common criteria (EUCC) for  which the ECCG gave a favourable opinion.  On the basis of an open consultation, the draft  candidate cybersecurity certification scheme on  European cloud services (EUCS) was reprocessed  and to a great extent finalised. Gradually, the  interest in EUCS shifted towards data localisation  and aspects of digital sovereignty. ENISA processed  a request for a scheme on 5G certification, which  was successfully launched following thorough  consultation with stakeholders.  Kicking off a new area, ENISA prepared  a cybersecurity market analysis framework and  a targeted analysis of the market for connected  devices in energy. In terms of standardisation,  ENISA launched specific requests to the European  Committee for Standardisation (CEN) and the  European Committee for Electrotechnical  Standardisation (CENELEC), and provided guidance  on 5G standards and related organisations and  on risk management.  ENISA worked on various fronts in terms  of consolidating information, analysing it, and  providing analyses and recommendations to serve  stakeholders’ expectations. Most notable examples of  ENISA’s efforts in the area of knowledge on emerging  cybersecurity challenges include designing the EU  cybersecurity index, publishing the annual threat  landscape and the supply chain attacks threat  landscape and in particular supporting the European  Cybersecurity Competence Centre, by identifying the  priorities in research and innovation priorities.  Behavioural change is the cornerstone of  cybersecurity awareness and education, and  requires persistent long-term effort, well-defined  objectives, identified target groups, and particularly  specific and relevant metrics and indicators for  measuring change. Given this, in 2021 ENISA laid  the groundwork for all the awareness activities to  ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2021 17  INTRODUCTION  be undertaken by the Agency in the coming years:  specifically, the development of a stakeholder  strategy; an awareness-raising framework, with a set  of processes and requirements for organising an  awareness-raising campaign; and finally a promotion  and dissemination strategy, presenting the most  effective means and channels to use for different  target audiences.  A number of structural changes were introduced in  2021 for the effective execution of ENISA’s mandate  and strategy. A new organisational structure was  approved by the Management Board in 2020, effective  as of 1 January 2021. The new organisational structure  aligns the tasks and functions of the Agency’s structural  set-up with the CSA, and ensures that all entities and  all staff members of the Agency exercise their tasks  and obligations in line with the Agency’s mission and  values, striving to reach and maintain the highest level  of openness, transparency and ethical standards.  The management team was established to assist  the Executive Director in his functions, ensuring that  activities undertaken by the Agency under its work  programme add value for the Union and are planned  and implemented in a coordinated fashion. A total  of six units were established: four operational units  tasked with Articles 5–7 of the CSA, and two corporate  units responsible for the administrative functions. In  addition, four teams were established, tasked with  Articles 8–12 and 42 of the CSA.  Two new committees were established in 2021  to help the Agency carry out its tasks. The  Budget Management Committee ensures the  coherent planning, implementation and follow- up of the Agency’s budget, and the Information  Technology Management Committee ensures the  comprehensive and coordinated management of  the Agency’s information technology systems and  services required to fulfil its core tasks.  Lastly, the Agency, with the agreement of the Greek  authorities, moved into new premises in Athens in  order to meet the growing needs of the Agency, and  a local office in Brussels was established to support  the implementation of structured cooperation with  Union institutions.  I  ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2021 19  The following sections of the Annual Activity Report are based  on the structure of the European Union Agency for Cybersecurity  (ENISA) Programming Document 2021–2023. The achievements  of each activity are described, including details of the outcome  of each output undertaken during the course of 2021.  PART I ACHIEVEMENTS OF THE YEAR  20  ACTIVITY 1 Providing assistance on policy  development  ENISA supported the objective of having cybersecurity included as an integral part of EU policy by  providing services related to the development of new policy files, by collecting evidence to support the  effectiveness of the existing policy framework and by providing EU policymakers and stakeholders with  policy recommendations on future cybersecurity challenges and opportunities.  Achievements ENISA actively contributed to 26 task forces and bodies, 161 workshops and conferences, and 6 European  Commission and Member State initiatives in response to requests. The budget allocated to this activity  went almost entirely into activities related to the collection of evidence for assessing existing policies or  developing new ones, including expanding the network and information security (NIS) investments report to  cover all 27 EU Member States. The Agency also participated in public hearings organised by the European  Parliament and followed up the trialogues. This is how the agency ‘ensured that EU policymakers are regularly  informed about the effectiveness of the existing frameworks and provided with timely and tailor-made policy  recommendations’. Activities related to the analysis and interpretation of the evidence itself were performed  using internal resources. The development of internal capabilities and skillsets to perform such analyses is under  way and will be the focus of the years to come.  The Agency developed internal positions, in cooperation with other teams and units, to support the relevant  competent authorities of the Commission and Member States (e.g. on supply chains and on the security  requirements of new sectors under the proposed revised network and information security directive (NISD2)),  the European Parliament and Council of the European Union with targeted policy analysis and reports.  ENISA developed targeted products and services (e.g. the NIS investments report) following an evidence-based  approach in order to ‘regularly inform EU policymakers about the effectiveness of the existing framework’. In  this context, the Agency established the EU Cybersecurity Policy Observatory (CSPO) as an internal function  to support evidence-based policymaking and inform policymakers through the provision of relevant evidence  and expert advice. The EU CSPO will help the Agency to contribute efficiently to an increasing number  of cybersecurity EU policies.  Strategic cooperation ENISA maintained and even further developed strategic relationships and cooperation with a number  of directorates-general. Examples include the support given by ENISA to the Directorate-General for  Communications Networks, Content and Technology (DG Connect) and to the European Parliament with regard  to NISD2 negotiations, its support to the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority and the  European Banking Authority in preparation for the Digital Operational Resilience Act (DORA) legislation, and its  support to the European Union Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators (ACER) for the development  of the Network CODE on cyber security (NCCS).  The work of ENISA during the reporting period offered insights into aspects of the impact of policy that so far  had not been visible to the EU or to national policymakers in the EU. The NIS investments report is a good  example of a maturing product, as it provides the concrete evidence needed to support the evaluation of the  impact of Directive (EU) 2016/1148 (the network and information security directive (NISD)) on the cybersecurity  of operators of essential services (OESs) / digital service providers (DSPs), and allows the identification of potential  gaps and opportunities. When moving from horizontal policy and regulatory instruments, such as the NISD, and  into sectoral analyses, the positive impact of the Agency’s activities had been limited by the fragmentation of the  policy responsibilities of the competent authorities of the Member States on cybersecurity matters. In order to  address this issue, ENISA closely engaged with the European Commission and the Member States, and still does so  to facilitate the development of appropriate forums and interfaces to support sector-focused discussions.  ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2021 21  PART I. Achievements of the year  ENISA was able to deliver opinions and written contributions on all topics identified by the Commission as  priorities. A key highlight of this activity is the support ENISA provided in relation to the review of the NISD  and the proposal for new sectors.  Resources ENISA’s ability to support different stages of the policy development life cycle is currently limited by a lack  of available human resources (HR) and a lack of relevant skills. There is a proliferation of sectoral or thematic  policy initiatives that include cybersecurity requirements as part of a broader policy intervention, but the Agency  does not necessarily have the resources to follow up all of them. The EU cybersecurity observatory (CSPO  could provide a framework for prioritisation and improved resource allocation, which would partly address  the problem of limited HR and pertinent skills.  Overall assessment The outputs of this activity are relevant and timely but require prioritisation from the Agency to best adapt  them to the available resources. With NISD2 bringing ever more sectors under the scope of the directive, it  is also essential that the policy frameworks of these sectors take account of cybersecurity aspects. However,  the Agency will never have sufficient resources to monitor and offer advice on each sector separately. Thus,  the EU CSPO is the concept to be applied to achieve this objective as the number of EU policies increase. The  implementation of the EU CSPO and its synergy with the foresight capabilities currently being developed within  the Agency are expected to enhance ENISA’s advisory capabilities on emerging areas. It will also allow the Agency  to bring emerging/future topics of interest to the attention of EU policymakers and stakeholders. Through this  process, areas and topics not currently part of the policy agenda can be thoroughly assessed at EU level in order  to identify in advance potential needs for policy intervention. The activity could benefit from having additional  experts familiar with the EU policy development life cycle, but also from having additional budget to further  deploy professional market intelligence in support of the CSPO.  The three outputs of the activity are relevant, as they meet the objectives of the activity and of the relevant  strategic objective with a minor change in the scope of output 1.3, which should be policy independent and also  allow for the development of a registry of EU cybersecurity policies. As regards the key performance indicators  (KPIs), the measurement of references to ENISA’s work in national policy documents (metric 1.2) proved difficult  given the language constraints of such an endeavour. Instead, the Agency proposes to focus the metric on the  EU level only and to extend the scope to include reports to which the Agency contributed (e.g. reports of the NIS  Cooperation Group).  Objectives  •  Foster cybersecurity as an integral part  of EU policy (existing and new)  •  Regularly inform EU policymakers about the  effectiveness of the existing framework  •  Provide EU policymakers and stakeholders  with timely and tailor-made policy  recommendations on future cybersecurity  challenges and opportunities  Link to strategic objective  (ENISA strategy)  •  Cybersecurity as an integral part of EU policies  Results  •  Where relevant, support the European Commission in ensuring that EU and national policies take  cybersecurity aspects into account  22  Outputs  1.1.  Issue reports, studies  and analyses on the  effectiveness of the  current cybersecurity  policy framework in  requested areas and  according to the relevant  best practices  1.2.  Support the European  Commission and Member  States by providing  tailor-made advice and  recommendations on  new policy initiatives  that tackle emerging  technological, societal  and economic trends  Outcome  •  ENISA published the second NIS investments report, providing  policymakers with insights into the cybersecurity budgets of OESs  and DSPs and how these budgets were influenced by the NISD, in  order to inform future policy decisions.  •  ENISA produced a stocktaking report to support evidence-based  policymaking in the health sector by providing sectoral national  competent authorities with relevant facts and with a gap analysis.  •  The Agency supported ACER by providing guidance on the framework  guidelines for the network code on the cybersecurity of cross-border  electricity flows.  •  ENISA contributed to the development of the Network CODE on  cyber security (NCCS) by participating in the drafting team. In this  context, ENISA organised a workshop in Athens in September for  the technical subgroup on information sharing.  The NIS investments report is available online  (https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/nis-investments-2021).  The output achieved its objectives in 2021. Its scope remains timely  and relevant. Based on ENISA’s assessment, it should remain in the  2023 single programming document (SPD).  •  ENISA continued supporting the European Commission and the  European Parliament with regard to NISD2 negotiations by:  –  providing technical expertise through written contributions  on supply chains and on the security requirements of new sector  under NISD2;  –  participating in several ad hoc meetings and delivering  technical briefings.  •  In the area of artificial intelligence (AI), ENISA:  –  supported the European Commission and Member States  by contributing to the public consultation on AI proposal for  a regulation, organising regular meetings and contributing to the  activities of the competent authorities for AI Member State-driven  working group;  –  collected and analysed data on AI cybersecurity strategies  and policies.  •  ENISA provided support to the European Commission and the  Directorate-General for Financial Stability, Financial Services  and Capital Markets in relation to the legislation for DORA for  the financial sector. ENISA supported the European Insurance  and Occupational Pensions Authority and the European Banking  Authority on harmonisation of incident reporting in preparation  for the DORA legislation.  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/nis-investments-2021  ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2021 23  PART I. Achievements of the year  1.3.  Assist the Commission in  reviewing the NIS directive  •  ENISA participated in the European Strategic Coordination Platform  with the objective of preparing the proposal for the regulation of  the European Union Aviation Safety Agency, and provided written  contributions on the acceptable means of compliance and guidance  material, which defines the details of the sectoral policy.  •  ENISA established the EU CSPO, which aims to support the European  Commission and Member States in different stages of the policy life  cycle through services focused on evidence-based policymaking and  systematic cybersecurity policy observation.  The output achieved its objectives in 2021. Its scope remains timely  and relevant. Based on ENISA’s assessment, it should remain in the  2023 SPD.  •  ENISA supported the consultations on the NISD proposal by  providing written contributions to the European Commission and by  organising meetings with it. In this context, the Agency prepared two  technical reports – one on the new sectors’ security requirements  in NISD2 and the other on good practices in supply chains – and  engaged in more than 15 virtual meetings with the Commission and  representatives of the European Parliament.  The output achieved its objectives in 2021. Its scope remains timely  and relevant, but it must be policy independent and also allow for  the development of a registry of EU cybersecurity policies. With this  change, the output should be included in the 2023 SPD.

The agency contributed to the  effective implementation of cybersecurity policy across the EU, and to the approximation of Member  State laws, regulations and administrative provisions related to cybersecurity.  Achievements The coordination and prioritisation of the Agency’s work based on available resources had a positive impact, as it  benefited from regular interactions with established groups and EU bodies such as DG Connect, the Directorate- General for Energy, the Body of European Regulators for Electronic Communications, the NIS Cooperation Group  (CG), ACER, the European Union Agency for Railways (ERA), the European Data Protection Supervisor (EDPS) and  the European Data Protection Board. Prominent examples in support of the relevant strategic objectives include:  •  providing support to 10 active work streams of the NISD Cooperation Group to help them meet their  objectives, contributing to the development of targeted reports on emerging issues (e.g. open radio access  network (O-RAN), top-level domain registry operators, domain name system (DNS) resolvers, coordinated  vulnerability disclosure policies) and organising knowledge-building seminars, thus contributing ‘to the  effective implementation of cybersecurity policy across the EU and approximation of Member State laws,  regulations and administrative provisions related to cybersecurity’ (SPD Activity 2 objective);  •  strengthening its sectoral approach to NISD implementation by developing vertical sectoral products  (e.g. a railway sector threat landscape, the Maritime Sector Risk Management Tool, the 5G matrix and an  energy threat landscape), building strategic relationships between horizontal and sectoral stakeholders,  linking operational cooperation and capacity building, and engaging with sectoral information-sharing  and analysis centres (ISACs) to ‘Align horizontal cybersecurity policies with sectoral polices and avoid  implementation inconsistencies’ (SPD Activity 2 objective);  •  building on the 5G toolbox with the development of a 5G control matrix, pursuing a leading role in the  establishment of the EU digital wallet toolbox, following Recommendation (EU) 2021/946 and thus contributing  ‘to the effective implementation of cybersecurity policy across the EU’ (SPD Activity 2 objective);  •  developing several focused publications targeting the needs of stakeholders to help them implement particular  policy aspects (e.g. SIM swapping, DNS resolvers, data protection engineering) and also events that brought  together stakeholders to discuss good policy options, such as the 1st ENISA Telecom Security Forum and the  7th ENISA Trust Services Forum;  •  supporting incident notification processes in accordance with Article 5(6) of the Cybersecurity Act (CSA), for  incident reporting under the European Electronic Communications Code (EECC), Regulation (EU) 910/2014  (the eIDAS regulation) and the NISD, delivering three annual EU-wide incident reports, and a prototype  for a consolidated EU incident-reporting dashboard.  Resources The available human and budgetary resources were divided between performing analyses of technical aspects  on validated priority areas, promoting good practices, engaging relevant communities and providing support  to formally established groups and bodies, such as the NIS CG. The NIS CG work programme reached a high  maturity level with 10 active work streams, meaning that the Agency had to prioritise, taking into account political  priorities and emerging legislative portfolios such as the EU digital wallet toolbox.  Policy development and implementation tasks cannot be easily outsourced or subcontracted. They require  analytical skills of senior experts of the Agency. It is a major challenge for the Agency to recruit and retain  ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2021 25  PART I. Achievements of the year  talented senior cybersecurity experts combining holistic policy expertise with technical expertise to support the  technical aspects of the implementation of cybersecurity policy.  In addition, the implementation of the NISD2 proposal, as well as important sectoral initiatives (e.g. DORA,  Network CODE on cyber security (NCCS), and the Aviation horizontal rule), will require a lot of resources in the  coming years to address the new tasks and also to cover all the new critical sectors and sustain the existing ones.  Overall assessment Currently, the sectoral cybersecurity policy development and implementation activities across the Union are  often unaligned and, thus, fragmented. A more holistic approach is required to align sectoral with horizontal  policies, to avoid inconsistencies, gaps, barriers and inefficiencies. However, the more sectoral initiatives  emerge, the greater the expectations are on ENISA’s contribution and engagement, thus creating resource  constraints on meeting these expectations. This means there is a need for prioritisation that would take into  consideration factors such as the maturity of the sectors trends in technology, criticality, recent incidents  and emerging threats. During the reporting year, ENISA worked on developing an NIS strategy intended to  streamline its services into standard packages for the NIS sectors, and target the different NIS sectors following  a careful assessment of sectoral needs and requirements.  Furthermore, an important opportunity lies in connecting the development and implementation of sectoral  cybersecurity policy with operational cooperation and capacity building. The experience of 2021 shows how  lessons learned in operational cooperation can feed into policy development and implementation as well as  capacity building to result in better and more targeted actions. This means that the agency will seek synergies  and align the work under Activities 1 and 2 with the work under Activities 3, 4 and 5 in the ENISA SPD. To achieve  the intended results, the Agency will prioritise its efforts and properly utilise its existing resources properly by  developing an NIS strategy that will partly address the problem. Still, additional resources will be needed in the  near future to deal with the new tasks under NISD2 as well as sectoral policy initiatives (e.g. DORA and Network  CODE on cyber security (NCCS). Seconded national experts can actually be one of the possible solutions to  address this problem because of their great experience with the implementation of national policy.  The outputs of the activity are relevant and timely; however, incident reporting (output 2.5 ‘Analyse and report  on incidents as required by Article 5(6) of the CSA on incident reporting’) was transferred to Activity 8 in the 2022  SPD to reinforce synergies with the outputs on foresight.  The four outputs of the activity will require additional rescoping to meet the needs of NISD2 and upcoming sectoral  regulations, and the work related to telecommunications should be merged into a single output. In addition,  sectoral work could be decoupled from the horizontal NISD implementation work to allow for greater focus. The  relevance and importance of vulnerability disclosure policies should also be examined in the coming years.  The existing KPIs are valid and relevant, and should be reviewed in the coming years.  Objectives  •  Align horizontal cybersecurity policies with  sectoral polices to avoid inconsistencies  in implementation  •  Contribute to the efficient and effective monitoring  of the implementation of EU cybersecurity policy  in Member States  •  Contribute to the effective implementation  of cybersecurity policy across the EU and  approximation of Member State laws,  regulations and administrative provisions  related to cybersecurity  •  Improve cybersecurity practices taking on board  lesson learned from incident reports  Link to strategic objective  (ENISA strategy)  •  Cybersecurity as an integral part of EU policies  •  Empowered and engaged communities across  the cybersecurity ecosystem  26  Outputs  2.1.  Support the NIS  Cooperation Group and  sectoral work streams in  accordance with the NIS  CG work programme  2.2.  Support Member States  and the European  Commission in the  implementation of the 5G  security toolbox and its  individual actions  Outcome  •  ENISA continued supporting the work of the NIS CG work  streams, promoting dialogue on supply chain security and  relevant security measures.  •  ENISA supported cross-border collaboration on incidents  experienced by digital service providers by piloting the ENISA  Cybersecurity Incident Reporting and Analysis tool.  •  The Agency analysed data and developed energy threat reports  every two months.  •  ENISA developed and organised sessions on cybersecurity topics for  the energy sector.  •  ENISA developed Member State guidelines on security measures  for top-level domain registry operators.  •  The Agency took stock, analysed data and drafted reports on security  measures and incident reporting for the health sector.  •  ENISA assisted with the organisation of events and carried out  out technical analysis in support of the work streams.  •  The Agency researched the security and privacy of public DNS  resolvers, providing insights into the effects of the use of encrypted  DNS protocols and into drivers for the shift away from traditional  DNS resolvers (https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/security- and-privacy-for-public-dns-resolvers).  The output achieved its objectives in 2021. Based on lessons learned, it  is proposed that the scope of this output should change to focus only  on horizontal matters of the implementation of the NISD and NISD2.  The sectoral policy implementation part should thus be part of a new,  dedicated output.  •  ENISA continued supporting the 5G toolbox by producing  a prototype version of the ‘5G Security Controls Matrix’ including  detailed security controls, descriptions of evidence and standard  references. The implementation is supported by a pilot run with  national regulatory authorities and mobile network operators.  •  ENISA explored the security challenges of network function  virtualisation in 5G networks and identified relevant best practices  (https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/nfv-security-in-5g- challenges-and-best-practices).  Results  •  Consistent implementation of EU policy and law in the area of cybersecurity  •  EU cybersecurity policy implementation reflecting sectoral specificities and needs  •  Exchange of good practice  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/security-and-privacy-for-public-dns-resolvers https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/security-and-privacy-for-public-dns-resolvers https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/nfv-security-in-5g-challenges-and-best-practices https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/nfv-security-in-5g-challenges-and-best-practices  ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2021 27  PART I. Achievements of the year  2.3.  Recommendations,  technical guidelines and  other activities to assist  with and support the  implementation of policies  within the NISD sectors,  in the area of trust  services and electronic  identification, under  the European Electronic  Communications Code  and its implementing acts,  and in the field of privacy  and data protection and  artificial intelligence  •  The Agency supported Member States on 5G security by organising  two 5G security knowledge-building seminars for the NIS CG.  •  The Agency explored the security challenges and benefits of  O-RAN, analysing technical risk scenarios and providing concrete  recommendations for updates to the Member States’ analysis.  •  ENISA supported DG Connect in reviewing the progress made in  each Member State in relation to the 5G toolbox implementation,  while providing suggestions on improving the questionnaire.  The output achieved its objectives in 2021. Based on the lessons learned,  it is proposed that the output should merge with the part of output 2.3  that deals with the European Electronic Communications Code to  constitute a single integrated output on telecom security and 5G.  •  ENISA continued the collection and analysis of data on a capability  maturity framework for the EU energy sector, providing useful  insights for the participants in the study.  •  ENISA supported port operators in conducting cyberrisk  management by publishing an online tool that helps them identify  security measures more easily based on their priorities.  •  In close collaboration with ERA, ENISA proposed a number of good  practices to follow to identify and manage the cyberrisk in the  railway sector (https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/railway- cybersecurity-good-practices-in-cyber-risk-management).  •  ENISA and ERA joined forces and organised a conference on  cybersecurity in railways.  •  ENISA organised the first ENISA Telecom Security Forum, bringing  together stakeholders from public and private sectors to debate on  emerging issues related to telecom security across Europe.  •  ENISA continued supporting the work of the European Competent  Authorities for Security of Electronic Communications (ECASEC)  Group of telecom security authorities. The group had three plenary  meetings during 2021 and participated in webinars on mobile  network security topics organised by ENISA.  •  In collaboration with the ECASEC Group, ENISA analysed fraudulent  SIM swapping, giving an overview of how SIM-swapping attacks work,  the frequency and impact of these attacks in Europe, and a set of  good practices to mitigate them.  •  The Agency supported the ECASEC Group in exploring consumer  outreach concerning cybersecurity threats telecom providers,  providing an overview of the current practices in relation to how  providers notify users of threats, and a framework to help assess the  necessity to carry out such outreach activities.  •  In collaboration with the ECASEC Group, ENISA analysed security  incidents affecting confidentiality, integrity and authenticity in public  electronic communications networks, focusing on those attacks that  target individual subscribers.  •  ENISA continued supporting technical aspects of implementing the  general data protection regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679) and  worked on analysing data protection engineering technologies and  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/railway-cybersecurity-good-practices-in-cyber-risk-management https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/railway-cybersecurity-good-practices-in-cyber-risk-management  28  2.4.  Assist in establishing and  implementing vulnerability  disclosure policies  techniques in addition to promoting pseudonymisation techniques  in the healthcare sector (https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/ data-protection-engineering, https://www.enisa.europa.eu/ publications/deploying-pseudonymisation-techniques).  •  ENISA co-organised with DG Connect the 9th Annual Privacy Forum  and hosted discussions on emerging legislative portfolios, including  the ePrivacy regulation proposal. In parallel, ENISA pursued an active  collaboration with the European Data Protection Board and the EDPS.  •  ENISA continued supporting the European Commission and Member  States in providing recommendations and technical guidelines  in the area of trust services and electronic identification. The  emerging topic of digital identification was the focus of two new  reports: an analysis of self-sovereign identity and a study of major  face presentation attacks (https://www.enisa.europa.eu/news/ enisa-news/beware-of-digital-id-attacks-your-face-can-be-spoofed).  Moreover, a workshop on ‘Remote identity proofing: attacks and  countermeasures’ was organised.  •  In collaboration with the European Commission, ENISA organised the  7th Trust Services Forum and hosted discussions on emerging topics  such as digital wallets; certification and standardisation in EU digital  identities; and the trust services market.  •  ENISA continued supporting the work of the ENISA Article 19 EG of  eIDAS supervisory bodies, holding three virtual meetings, a workshop  on blockchain security and a training course on cloud security.  •  ENISA supported the European Commission on the toolbox process  for a coordinated approach towards a European digital identity  framework and contributed to the security analysis of digital wallets.  The output achieved its objectives in 2021. Based on the lessons  learned, it is proposed that the scope of this output should not include  the EECC but rather the EECC should be merged with output 2.2 (see  assessment above).  •  ENISA took stock of the national coordinated vulnerability disclosure  (CVD) policies in the EU, publishing a detailed map of the different  policies in the EU, and providing an overview of risks, challenges and  good practices for the development of CVD policies.  •  ENISA supported the exchange of good practices between Member  States by organising a workshop for authorities about coordinated  vulnerability disclosure policies and initiatives.

Achievements The Agency assisted Member States in measuring the maturity level of national cybersecurity strategies (NCSSs)  through the deployment of an online tool that was developed with contributions from 20 Member States and  is already being considered for use by six Member States. This has provided the basis for the creation of the  cybersecurity index quantitative KPIs.  In parallel, significant effort was devoted to the preparation of the new strategy for exercises and training as  a result of the CSA. In this context, the preparatory work was carried out for the required switch to the new Cyber  Exercise Platform, which is better suited to supporting the objectives set in the new strategy.  In 2021, ENISA was confronted with the challenges brought about by the pandemic, which affected capacity- building activities at multiple levels. On the one hand, a number of courses and exercises had to be converted for  online delivery, for obvious reasons. This change posed a number of challenges, since the conversion of a course  or exercise to an online medium required rethinking and remodelling the material for delivery.  The Agency organised the European Cyber Security Challenge (ECSC) 2021 final, a competition that was widely  acknowledged as the best so far since 2016. We are now confident that the ECSC goal of attracting participation  from all EU Member States and European Free Trade Association (EFTA) countries will be reached in the next  two or three years. In this context, the process of setting the goals of the ECSC five years from now has already  started. This includes features such as expanding participation by admitting accession candidate countries and  teams from outside Europe that participate in the competition but are not part of the score board. Moreover, the  competition content will be further enhanced through the inclusion of defence against attack, social engineering  challenges, etc. Lessons learned in 2021 from both the ECSC and the International Cybersecurity Challenge (ICC)  (in 2021, under Activity 9) provided valuable contributions for the future.  ENISA developed a methodology for assessing the potential interoperability of risk management frameworks  and methodologies and supported with the identification of cybersecurity skills needs and gaps. In 2022 the  assessment of the methodology and the iterative process of improving it will take place.  Resources All activities were duly resourced, and the budget allocated to them was used as planned. The carry-over amount  in Activity 3 mainly relates to the postponement of two big events from 2021 to 2022, namely the Cyber Europe  Exercise and the ICC, due to the ongoing pandemic. In terms of HR, all activities were also duly resourced. The  slight deviation in the actual FTEs consumed had to do with delays encountered in recruitment, which were  compensated for by the existing team. The experience of 2021 is the main driver of budget estimates for 2024  onwards. ENISA is therefore processing its own quantified approach along these lines.  Overall assessment Although 2021 was an important year for capacity-building activities, it also demonstrated the long road ahead  in terms of moving closer to achieving cutting-edge competences and capabilities in cybersecurity across the  EU – the Agency’s strategic multiannual objective to which the activity contributes. As shown in the evaluation  of KPIs of the activity, important gaps persist in terms of both ensuring the maturity of Member States’ national  strategies (the Member States that participated self-assessed their maturity as low or medium, rather than high)  and ensuring that ENISA exercises and training deliver high levels of added value. Although there is currently  no overall understanding of the level of capabilities across the Union – a situation that should change after the  ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2021 31  PART I. Achievements of the year  pilot cybersecurity index has been conducted in 2022 – evaluation of indicators points to the need for increased  efforts and investments in capacity building.  Thus, it is important that for exercises and training one of the main priorities for 2021 was the development of the  new approach that takes into account the new conditions set by the CSA, which expands ENISA’s audience in terms  of capacity building with the addition of EU institutions and agencies. This work had to be carried out at the same  time as the Agency had to continue to provide its services to Member States. The direction set by the Management  Board during its strategic discussion in March 2022 points to a clear way forward to consolidate ENISA exercises  and training and focus them on specific stakeholders while putting more emphasis on linking specific training  and exercise events with better-defined medium- and long-term goals for building capacity. Secondly, the Agency  needs to step up and strengthen its support to Member States in terms of helping them to develop and maintain  comprehensive and effective national strategic frameworks that underpin national capacity-building.  Objectives  •  Increase the level of preparedness of and  cooperation within and between Member States  and sectors, and EUIBAs  •  Prepare and test capabilities to respond to  cybersecurity incidents  •  Foster interoperable European risk  management, consistent methodology  and risk assessment practices  •  Increase skill sets and align  cybersecurity competences  •  Increase the supply of skilled professionals  to meet market demand, including supporting  the necessary educational structures  Link to strategic objective  (ENISA strategy)  •  Cutting-edge competences and capabilities  in cybersecurity across the EU  •  Empowered and engaged communities across  the cybersecurity ecosystem  Results  •  Enhanced capabilities across the community  •  Increased cooperation between communities  Outputs  3.1.  Assist Member States  to develop national  cybersecurity strategies  Outcome  •  ENISA developed an online tool to accompany the national  cybersecurity assessment framework in order to help Member States  perform a self-assessment exercise meant to improve national  cybersecurity capabilities (https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/national- cyber-security-strategies/national-cyber-security-strategies-guidelines- tools/national-cybersecurity-assessment-framework-ncaf-tool#/).  •  ENISA produced a study on good practices on citizens’ awareness  of cybersecurity (https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/raising- awareness-of-cybersecurity).  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/national-cyber-security-strategies/national-cyber-security-strategies-guidelines-tools/national-cybersecurity-assessment-framework-ncaf-tool#/ https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/national-cyber-security-strategies/national-cyber-security-strategies-guidelines-tools/national-cybersecurity-assessment-framework-ncaf-tool#/ https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/national-cyber-security-strategies/national-cyber-security-strategies-guidelines-tools/national-cybersecurity-assessment-framework-ncaf-tool#/ https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/raising-awareness-of-cybersecurity https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/raising-awareness-of-cybersecurity  32  3.2.  Organise large-scale  biannual exercises  and sectoral exercises  (including Cyber Europe,  Blueprint Operational  Level Exercise (Blue OLEx),  CyberSOPEx)  •  ENISA organised the annual NCSS workshop, which took place  online (https://www.enisa.europa.eu/events/9th-enisa-national- cybersecurity-strategies-workshop).  In the area of NCSSs, all objectives were met in 2021. For 2022, the aim  is to develop a good practices framework (expanding on the work of  the national cybersecurity assessment framework tool) and to continue  the iterative process of reviewing/improving the NCSS map. From  2022 onwards, not only will the work continue in an iterative process  (namely, use of the tools – assessment of framework’s effectiveness –  improvement of framework) but we will further build on the links of  this activity to the cybersecurity index and info hub activities.  The Exercises Team of the Agency organised or co-organised the  following exercises during the reporting period.  •  CyberSOPEx 2021: testing the standard operating procedures  (SOPs) of the Computer Security Incident Response Teams (CSIRTs)  Network. This was organised and conducted by ENISA.  •  CySOPEx 2021: testing the SOPs of the CyCLONe Network. This was  co-organised and conducted by ENISA.  •  Blue OLEx 2021: testing the CyCLONe SOPs but with the main focus  on CyCLONe’s decision-making and internal communication at  executive level. This was co-organised and conducted by ENISA.  •  Cyber Crisis Coordination Exercise 2021 for the European  Commissioners’ cabinets. ENISA was involved in the scenario  preparation and supporting the execution.  •  EU Cyber Crisis Linking Exercise on Solidarity: preparations started in  2021, and the execution will take place in 2022. ENISA was part of the  core planners’ team, together with the National Cybersecurity Agency  of France (which was the main initiator) and the European External  Action Service (EEAS).  •  European Union Agency for the Operational Management of Large- Scale IT Systems in the Area of Freedom, Security and Justice (eu-LISA)  corporate information technology (IT) exercise 2021. The objective  of this was to validate the security policies and procedures of the  business continuity policies, business continuity plans and disaster  recovery plans applicable to corporate IT infrastructure. It also  intended to identify gaps in the coordination and communication  taking place among the different stakeholders concerned in the event  of a crisis. ENISA was involved in supporting the preparation of the  exercise and providing the Cyber Exercise Platform.  In addition, ENISA engaged in the preparatory work for Cyber Europe  2022 together with the Austrian planners. This included updating the  current Cyber Exercise Platform, to make it more secure and resilient,  and creating extra scenario options. It is also worth noting that the  pandemic forced a change in plan of the organisation of Cyber Europe in  order to take into account the shifting of the exercise from 2021 to 2022.  The two main achievements in this area (as well as for output 3.3 below)  in 2021 were the preparation of the new ENISA strategy on exercises,  and training courses meeting the requirements of the CSA. At the same  time, the Exercises Team also started the necessary preparatory work  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/events/9th-enisa-national-cybersecurity-strategies-workshop https://www.enisa.europa.eu/events/9th-enisa-national-cybersecurity-strategies-workshop  ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2021 33  PART I. Achievements of the year  3.3.  Organise training  and other activities to  support and develop the  maturity and skills of  CSIRTs (including NISD  sectoral CSIRTs) and other  communities  3.4.  Develop coordinated  and interoperable risk  management frameworks  for switching to the new Cyber Exercise Platform in 2022. This was  considered to be necessary because the platform currently used by  the team was reaching the end of its life. The preparations included  stocktaking of user requirements from the group of Member State  planners. In 2022–2023, the team will devote effort to informing  all relevant communities in accordance with the CSA) of the new  strategies on exercises and trainings. Moreover, in 2022 ENISA will  focus on implementing the provisions of the new strategies.  New e-learning material was developed on the topic of ransomware. It  involves the ATT&CK framework to help analysts understand and the  tactics, techniques and procedures of adversaries. The objective here  was to promote mitigation measures in order to ensure better protection  against similar threats. In-depth training courses and accompanying  tabletop exercises were delivered in 2021: the information security  management and information and communications technology (ICT)  security courses were held in two iterations each and had 59 participants  in total during the 5-day training. The cyber threat management course  had 16 participants completing the three days of training. ENISA  organised and conducted an interactive tabletop capacity-building activity  for representatives of EU Member States participating in the cooperation  group’s work stream 12 on the health sector.  In its cooperation with CERT-EU, ENISA’s objective was to provide  a state-of-the-art, relevant and cost-efficient training portfolio for  the benefit of both Member States and EUIBAs. A close operational  collaboration with CERT-EU and its other key stakeholders was  developed to this end and to support cybersecurity capacity building.  •  Report Interoperable EU Risk Management Framework. ENISA  published a methodology for assessing the potential interoperability  of risk management frameworks and methodologies, and presented  the results (https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/interoperable- eu-risk-management-framework).  •  Report Compendium of Risk Management Frameworks with  Potential Interoperability. This collection of identified frameworks  and methodologies includes well-known and widely used risk  management standards that provide high-level guidelines for  risk management processes that can be applied in all types  of organisations (https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/ compendium-of-risk-management-frameworks).  •  Workshop on interoperability of EU risk management frameworks.  The workshop was conducted as a means to present to stakeholders  the work done by ENISA in the field of risk management with a focus  on the interoperability of EU risk management frameworks.  The main achievement of 2021 in this area was the establishment  of the risk management framework. In 2022, the focus will now shift  to assessing its interoperability potential. The iterative process will be  completed by improving on the framework from 2023 onwards.  34  3.5.  Support the capacity- building activities of the  NIS CG and sectoral work  streams in accordance  with the NIS CG work  programme  3.6.  Support the  establishment,  development and  cooperation of European  information-sharing  schemes based on  ISACs, public–private  partnerships and other  existing mechanisms  •  Capacity-building activity for NIS CG work stream 12 (Health).  ENISA delivered an interactive tabletop capacity-building activity  that provides a safe environment among peers to increase the  overall competence of NIS authorities in addressing cybersecurity  in the health sector.  •  Roadmap for capacity-building activities for NIS CG work streams.  ENISA launched a survey to identify the needs of the NIS CG work  streams for capacity-building activities and accordingly to prioritise  future activities based on the needs identified. This work is closely  related to the work carried out under output 3.2. In this respect,  the work on training provided under this output is aligned with the  strategy on exercises and training developed under outputs 3.2  and 3.3.  This output, as is also the case for output 3.6, forms a specific use case  (for a specific user group) of the work developed under outputs 3.2 and  3.3. In this light, in 2022–2023, the team will devote effort to ensuring  (as was the case in 2021) that the work for this user group is fully aligned  with the new strategies on exercises and training. Moreover, in 2022,  ENISA will focus on implementing the provisions of the new strategies.  •  Report Cross-Sector Exercise Requirements for ISACs. This report  seeks to identify the skills, exercises and training needed to help  information exchange between ISACs (https://www.enisa.europa.eu/ publications/cross-sector-exercise-requirements).  •  Report Zoning and Conduits for Railways. The report is designed  to give guidance on building cybersecurity zones and conduits for  a railway system (https://www.enisa.europa.eu/news/building-cyber- secure-railway-infrastructure).  •  Supporting the European Commission with the ISACs Platform.  ENISA provided support to the project on developing new ISACs and  improving existing ones. The support involved participating in meetings  with the Commission and providing expert opinion on cybersecurity  architecture and the cybersecurity functions of the platform.  •  Supporting EU ISACs. ENISA continued its support to the various  EU ISACs. In the finance ISAC, ENISA organised two virtual meetings  and one physical meeting. In the energy ISAC, ENISA organised three  online webinars (operational technology cybersecurity, vulnerability  framework, and AI and operational technology and prepared an  annual ISAC threat landscape. In the maritime and health ISACs,  ENISA provided support in organising meetings and exchange  of good practices.  ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2021 35  PART I. Achievements of the year  The 7th edition of the European Cyber Security Challenge, ECSC 2021,  was hosted in Prague in October. The organiser of ECSC 2021 was the  Czech chapter of AFCEA.  In total, 300 people (contestants, coaches and judges) representing  20 EU and EFTA countries competed in the ECSC final in Prague, and  one country from outside Europe participated for the first time in the  competition as a guest (Canada). The finalists of ECSC 2021 were the  teams from Germany, Italy and Poland.  Furthermore, in view of its participation in the International  Cybersecurity Challenge (ICC), for the first time ENISA assembled  a European team during the reporting year. A total of 55 candidates  from 21 countries were preselected to potentially be part of the final  Team Europe that will participate in the finals in June 2022 (in Athens).  To support the selection process, two physical boot camps were held  in 2021 (in Tallinn and Turin) together with an online qualifier event.  It is also worth noting that the pandemic forced us to re-plan the  organisation of ICC in order to take into account the shifting of the final  from 2021 to 2022.  Despite the negative impact of the pandemic on the organisation  of large-scale physical meetings such as the ECSC, the final of 2021  was the best to date. The ECSC is the biggest competition of its  kind worldwide and established the blueprint that we used for the  organisation of the ICC. The latter will now become an integral part  of it. Moreover, the output will also include a training activity targeting  young talents who can participate in the ECSC and ICC (obviously linked  to output 3.3). In 2022–2023 and onwards, the emphasis of the ECSC  will be on setting the priorities and challenges for the next 5 years,  while that of the ICC will be on agreeing an established governance  structure for the future.  3.7.  Organise the European  Cyber Security Challenge  (ECSC)  3.8.  Report on cybersecurity  skill needs and  gaps, and support  skills development,  maintenance and  implementation (including  the Digital Education  Action Plan and a report  on higher education  programmes)  •  Report Addressing the EU cybersecurity skills shortage and gap  through higher education. ENISA contributed to providing an  overview of the current supply of cybersecurity skills in Europe  through an analysis of data gathered and generated by the recently  established Cybersecurity Higher Education Database  (https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/addressing-skills- shortage-and-gap-through-higher-education).  •  Maintenance of the Cybersecurity Higher Education Database  (CyberHEAD). It became the main point of reference for students  looking for a cybersecurity job. With more than 130 programmes,  it stands as the largest EU-validated source of information  for cybersecurity programmes  (https://www.enisa.europa.eu/cyberhead).  Already in the last few years significant steps have been made in  this area, addressing the cybersecurity skills shortage in the EU in  a systematic way. Through the development of the skills framework  and CyberHEAD, ENISA is making an important contribution in this  areas. In 2022–2023, ENISA will continue reviewing and improving the  framework in an iterative process while at the same time increasing  36  Key performance indicators Increased resilience against cybersecurity risks  and preparedness to respond to cyberincidents  Unit of  measure-  ment  Frequency Data source Results  3.1. Increase/decrease in maturity indicators  Maturity of national cybersecurity strategies  Number of Member States that rate the overall maturity of their cybersecurity strategy  High maturity Number Annual Survey 3  Medium maturity Number Annual Survey 4  Low maturity Number Annual Survey 3  Number of Member States planning to use ENISA framework to measure the maturity of their national  cybersecurity capabilities  Already using Number Annual Survey 1  Not using but planning to use Number Annual Survey 5  Don’t know or will not use in the foreseeable future Number Annual Survey 4  Number of Member States that have set KPIs to measure progress and effectiveness of the implementation of their  strategic objectives when drafting their NCSSs  Already using Number Annual Survey 3  Not set but planning to use Number Annual Survey 4  Don’t know or have not set KPIs currently  and will not set KPIs  Number Annual Survey 3  The frequency with which Member States update their strategies to adapt to technological advancements and new threats  Every 2–3 years Number Annual Survey 2  Every 4–5 years Number Annual Survey 6  More than 6 years or don’t know Number Annual Survey 2  Total maturity of ISACs (self-assessment) % Annual ISAC dashboard 63 %  ISAC A % Annual ISAC dashboard 60 %  ISAC B % Annual ISAC dashboard 56 %  ISAC C % Annual ISAC dashboard 90 %  ISAC D % Annual ISAC dashboard 50 %  ISAC F % Annual ISAC dashboard 63 %  3.2. Outreach, uptake and application of lessons learned from capability-building activities  CySOPEx 2021 (number of improvements  proposed by participants)  Number Per exercise 5  the number of academic institutes included in CyberHEAD.

The establishment of the Operational Cooperation Unit,  ENISA orchestrated the support envisioned as Secretariat of the CSIRTs Network (defined by NISD1) together with  the newly established CyCLONe (Cyber Crisis Liaison Network) launched in September 2020. This enabled ENISA  to synergise the support for these networks.  In relation to the CSIRTs Network, ENISA’s efforts went beyond the active support of daily operations in case  of incidents and brought the CSIRTs Network much forward in terms of operational cooperation. The Secretariat  facilitated for example with vendor outreach and supported the Network during extended alert periods relating  to high profile situations such as MS Exchange and Log4j. The Secretariat supported with ad-hoc reporting to  members and extended its’ operational support beyond working hours and holidays, thus prompting the CSIRTs  Network members to engage actively, despite the COVID-19 pandemic situation. All these were achieved based  on the capacity of the Secretariat to go the extra mile for the benefit of the Network.  It was a milestone year for CyCLONe as it was the first full year of operation and the Secretariat used its existing  knowledge from the CSIRTs Network support to bring this newly established network rapidly up to speed in  terms of tools and procedures which resulted in 1011% more interactions compared to the Q4 2021. Thus  providing a solid basis for future interactions between the CyCLONe and the CSIRTs Network.  2021 was also the first year when the same exercise scenario was tested at both the technical and operational  levels in a series of exercises engaging all networks. For the technical level CyberSOPex tested the CSIRTs  Network readiness and was followed by other exercises designed at the operational level. CyCLONe was tested  for first time during the CySOPex 2021 exercise that was tailored for CyCLONe officers whilst 2021 BlueOlex  exercise was tailored for the high-level actors of national cybersecurity authorities. Moreover, under the  Slovenian Presidency, ENISA organised the first physical post pandemic meeting, the 15th CSIRTs Network  meeting and the first ever shared session with CyCLONe.  In addition to these activities and in cooperation with the European Commission and with the Slovenian  presidency, ENISA organised hybrid and virtual workshops to support the discussions around the Joint Cyber Unit  initiative: one workshop dedicated to the preparatory activities and two more workshops dedicated to situational  awareness of the EUIBAs and EU MSs respectively. These activities initialised the discussions on exploring the  potential of the JCU and initiated a better and closer cooperation between the EUIBAs in the field of operational  cooperation, more specifically in the area of situational awareness (linked to Activity 5).  ENISA also facilitated the operation and information exchange with infrastructure, tools and expertise. Support  activities included the development and maintenance of IT platforms (including MeliCERTes) and communication  channels, exchanges of best practices, guidance and advice regarding incident response.  For instance, for the  MeliCERTes project, activities continued on maintenance of the previous version of MeliCERTes. In addition to  this, a complete high-level architecture of the next version of the platform was created and presented to the  CSIRTs Network. In 2021, ENISA worked on the technical specifications for this new architecture and started  building it up. In particular, ENISA provided high-availability to these infrastructures and tools.  To support both  versions of MeliCERTes project, interoperability tests were carried out and witnessed by ENISA and funded by the  Connecting Europe Facility (CEF) Telecom Cybersecurity program.  In addition, activities were carried out to improve and update maturity frameworks of the EUIBAs and to support  cooperation between CSIRTs and Law Enforcement.  ENISA continued to work closely with other EUIBAs (European Union Institutions, Bodies and Agencies).  Based on the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) signed in 2018 between ENISA, EDA, Europol EC3  and CERT-EU, cooperation activities continued with annual activities. In addition, a new MoU was signed  with CERT-EU leveraging on structured collaboration in accordance with the Cybersecurity Act.  ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2021 39  PART I. Achievements of the year  Resources As mentioned above, 2021 activities were covered thanks to the ability of the unit staff members to be flexible  and go the extra mile. The Unit started the year without staff members in all the allocated posts. Without the  commitment of the unit staff members, that also supported the integration of the new colleagues and SNEs,  the agency would not have been able to support the extended escalated modes as in the case of MS exchange  and Log4j, or to deliver on the unplanned activities such as the one related to JCU initiative (published during  2021).  This resulted in a lot of strain on the limited staff members in the Unit.  It should be noted that at the time  of writing some additional SNEs have been foreseen for the unit in the coming year.  To be able to increase its’  capability to deliver upon Activity 4, both in terms of the Secretariat and as regards infrastructure and tools, the  Unit would require additional resources, also in view of the need to be able to function 24/7.  The Unit took over and manages several tools and platforms that require permanent availability. To ensure  continuation of services (for end of the year and the beginning of the next one) some of the services such as licences  and maintenance contracts were de-synchronized from the annual budgetary cycle. The unit is reviewing its budget  planning to better align service provisions to the financial/budgetary cycles, to reduce the amounts carry over,  however the adjustments will most likely only be noticeable as of 2023 due to existing provisions and contracts.  Overall assessment With the creation of the Operational Cooperation Unit, the baseline for operational cooperation in the EU in  a structured way was enabled thus further strengthening the CSIRTs Network, establishing the CyCLONe foothold  and initiating greater interaction with the EUIBAs. In order to reach the full potential of such cooperation and  further improve capabilities and enable effective incident response and crisis cooperation among Member States  and EU institutions, additional resources will need to be allocated to sustain the evolving threat landscape. The  unit already planned a re-structuring of the activity dedicated to operational cooperation in 2022. In the 2022 SPD  similar activities such as management of tools and platforms were gathered under same output with the same  for activities involving common stakeholders. The process to find the best balance and the most efficient mode  of organisation will require assessment of the steps already planned for 2022.  This activity should also focus  on secure communication channels for the various operational communities that would require staff with the  necessary experience.  Objectives  •  Enhance and improve incident response  capabilities across the EU  •  Enable effective incident response and  cooperation among Member States and EU  institutions (including through the blueprint)  •  Improve the maturity and capacities of operational  communities (including the CSIRTs Network  and CyCLONe)  Link to strategic objective  (ENISA strategy)  •  Effective cooperation among operational  actors within the EU should massive cyber  incidents arise  •  Empowered and engaged communities across  the cybersecurity ecosystem  Results  •  All communities (EU institutions and Member States) use a rationalised set of SOPs  •  An agreed CSIRTs Network approach to selecting, operating and decommissioning tools  •  Coherent SOPs for cybercrisis management  •  Efficient framework, tools and methodologies for effective cybercrisis management  40  Outputs  4.1.  Support the functioning  and operations of the  CSIRTs Network (including  through MeliCERTes) and  CyCLONe, and cybercrisis  management in the EU  Outcome  CSIRTs Network-related activities  ENISA, as secretariat of the CSIRTs Network, supported all the aspects  related to the functioning of the network, including hosting a variety  of tools for the purposes of communication, operational effectiveness,  collaboration and information sharing.  Under the 2021 Portuguese Presidency, ENISA organised the 13th and  14th CSIRTs Network meetings, including a shared session with the NIS  CG. Under the Slovenian Presidency, ENISA organised the first physical  post-pandemic meeting, the 15th CSIRTs Network meeting which was  the first ever shared session with CyCLONe.  In line with NISD requirements, ENISA supported the drafting of  the third report to the Cooperation Group and, parallel to the  ordinary functioning of the CSIRTS Network, ENISA also supported  the operational cooperation among all CSIRTs Network members  during all the high-profile incidents that required escalation and,  among other outcomes, resulted in public statements on the Microsoft  Exchange (https://www.enisa.europa.eu/news/enisa-news/statement- on-microsoft-exchange-vulnerabilities) and Log4j (https://www.enisa. europa.eu/news/enisa-news/log4j-vulnerability-update-from-the- csirts-network) vulnerabilities, and in the establishment of the CSIRTs  Network GitHub (https://github.com/enisaeu/CNW).  ENISA organised CyberSOPEx in October 2021, in order to further test the  readiness of the CSIRTs Network for large-scale cross-border incidents,  and the same scenario was also used in the CyCLONe exercises.  Studies dedicated to specific tools and training material were produced  for the purpose of improved cooperation and collaboration between  Member States and EUIBAs as well as between CSIRTs and LE  (https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/2021-report-on-csirt-law- enforcement-cooperation).  ENISA published an updated handbook (https://www.enisa. europa.eu/publications/aspects-of-cooperation-between-csirts- and-le-handbook-2021) and toolset (https://www.enisa.europa. eu/publications/aspects-of-cooperation-between-csirts-and-le- toolset-2021) on Aspects of Cooperation between CSIRTs and LE.  Two training sessions were organised in August and in October 2021  to pilot the ENISA training material on CSIRT–LE cooperation.  The10th ENISA–EC3 Workshop on CSIRT–LE Cooperation took place on  19 October 2021 and brought together the CSIRTs and LE communities  from EU Member States and EFTA countries.  Furthermore, together with the CSIRTs Network, ENISA updated and  improved the CSIRTs maturity framework (https://www.enisa.europa. eu/publications/enisa-csirt-maturity-framework). ENISA coordinated  with EUIBAs to draft the first maturity model for the EU’s cybercrisis  management. The model was made available to the EUIBAs.  ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2021 41  PART I. Achievements of the year  CyCLONe Officers Network-related activities  The EU CyCLONe was launched in 2020. In 2021 ENISA focused on  further development of this new network by providing the secretariat  as well as the tools and support required to ensure the functioning and  interactions between the Member States.  Under the 2021 Portuguese Presidency, ENISA successfully organised  and coordinated all supporting activities for the 2nd and 3rd CyCLONe  Officers Meetings. Under the Slovenian Presidency, ENISA supported  the CyCLONe Chair and Members and successfully organised the  4th CyCLONe Officers Meeting and the first ever physical meeting  of CyCLONe officers, the 5th CyCLONe Officers Meeting, in a hybrid  form in Ljubljana, with a shared session with the CSIRTs Network that  resulted in a formal input to the JCU discussions.  This was also the first year that the same exercise scenario was tested  at technical and operational levels and it was the CyCLONe first ever  operational level through:  •  CySOPex 2021, the exercise tailored for the CyCLONe officers,  in May 2021;  •  Blue Olex 2021, the exercise tailored for the high-level members  of national cybersecurity authorities, in October 2021.  ENISA carried out several activities designed to improve information  sharing and operational cooperation, in particular regarding  automated reporting, impact assessment and situational awareness,  using the CyCLONe tools.  Joint Cyber Unit preparatory activities  In the context of the JCU initiative, in cooperation with the European  Commission and with the Slovenian Presidency, ENISA organised hybrid  or virtual workshops: one workshop dedicated to the preparatory  activities for the JCU, and two more workshops dedicated to situational  awareness in the EUIBAs and EU Member States respectively.  MeliCERTes project and tools  During 2021, ENISA maintained and applied patches to the Central  Service Platform based on the penetration test conducted by the  MeliCERTes consortium. In addition, the first-tier helpdesk continued  to be provided by ENISA.  Workshops in the CSIRTS Network tooling working group were  organised, so that the specifications for the Identity and Access  Management system could be defined. For this purpose, a comparative  analysis of several proofs of concept was conducted.  In addition, technical requirements for MeliCERTes 2 tools were  collected and the expectations for the recovery time objectives and  recovery point objectives were defined.  ENISA participated in several exercises for the business continuity  plan, and in the risk assessment of specific central services. ENISA also  proceeded with the procurement and installation of extra hardware  and software needed for the centrally hosted services of MeliCERTes.  In particular, ENISA set up the secondary site in Athens to host nodes  for the high available services of the MeliCERTes project.  42  4.2.  Activities to support  the development,  implementation and  evolution of MoUs  between ENISA, Europol,  CERT-EU and the EDA  In the context of the MoU, between ENISA, Europol, CERT-EU and the  European Defence Agency (EDA), these four organisations identified  areas of cooperation based on their common interest. During 2021, the  focus was on information exchange, education and training (including  cyberexercises), technical/operational cooperation and strategic matters.  ENISA acted as chair of the MoU during the reporting year. Several  deliverables were prepared.  •  ENISA developed and delivered to the MoU partners a collaboration  portal for the project management of the MoU roadmap to facilitate  interactions among MoU partners.  •  In the area of exercises, ENISA, EC3 and CERT-EU worked together on  the preparation of several cybercrisis exercises.  •  ENISA and EC3 organised high-level workshops bringing together  their respective communities i.e. CSIRTs and LE). During the  workshops, representatives from CSIRTs and LE discussed their  success stories and challenges related to their cooperation.  In March 2021, ENISA and CERT-EU agreed on a structured cooperation  on the basis of the provision of the CSA (Article 7.4) by signing an  MoU covering operational cooperation as well as capacity building,  knowledge and information. This new MoU was needed because of  the operational nature of the cooperation mandated by the CSA. The  activities for 2021 were agreed and planned in the annual cooperation  plan. As part of the efforts for further development of the Blueprint,  ENISA and CERT-EU aligned actions on developing EUIBA SOPs and  improving the Unions common situational awareness.  For 2022 this activity has been moved under the new re-defined  Output 4.1 in order to streamline the efforts and improve efficiency  when interacting with EUIBAs.  The first stable version of Cerebrate (https://github.com/cerebrate- project/cerebrate), an open-source platform meant to act as a trusted  contact information provider and interconnection orchestrator for other  security tools, was published. A pilot version was installed in ENISA.  ENISA also carried out activities for the development and maintenance  of the CSIRTs Network Portal.  With the creation of the Operational Cooperation Unit, the baseline  for operational cooperation in the EU in a structured way was  enabled thus further strengthening the CSIRTs Network, establishing  the CyCLONe foothold and initiating greater interaction with the  EUIBAs. In order to reach the full potential of such cooperation and  further improve capabilities and enable effective incident response  and crisis cooperation among Member States and EU institutions,  additional resources will need to be allocated to sustain the evolving  threat landscape  ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2021 43  PART I. Achievements of the year  4.3.  Develop SOPs,  procedures,  methodologies and  tools for cybercrisis  management  ENISA’s objectives for 2021 were to support the activities dedicated to  the cooperation of the operational actors within the Union in the event  of massive cyberattacks, and to empower and engage communities.  This work supports the implementation of the Blueprint for the EUIBAs  and was done in liaison with other EUIBAs.  Several deliverables were prepared in order to analyse the ecosystem  of cooperation. In particular, these reports covered a wide spectrum:  • an in-depth research analysis of SOPs;  • a set of comprehensive SOPs;  • an SOP survey of the EUIBAs;  • a set of guidelines for crisis communications.  ENISA also organised a working group of EUIBAs to exchange  information, and organised several bilateral and multilateral meetings  with the stakeholders to develop the SOPs and a plan for a 3-year  exercise programme.  Several steps were undertaken under this output such as crisis  communication. The goal of having EUIBA SOPs in place was not  achieved because of moving targets such as the JCU. In general, the work  under this output should focus more on supporting the task force / JCU.

The Agency fine-tuned  its’ weekly service (OSINT report) distributing information on relevant event to different stakeholder groups,  including CSIRT Network, CyCLONe, EUIBAs services, and Member State’s national authorities for critical sectors.  ENISA also actively supported the consolidation and exchange of information on strategic, tactical and technical  levels to operational communities, such as the CSIRTs Network and CyCLONe as well as relevant EUIBAs services  such as DG CONNECT, CERT-EU, Europol EC3, INTCEN, EEAS Security and Defence Policy - Cyber Security, and  EEAS Stratcom 2. In particular, as part of its structured cooperation with CERT-EU, ENISA piloted Joint Rapid  Report services. This product provides timely information to senior decision makers about on-going cyber events  and incidents and is expected to transition to production in the first half of 2022.  ENISA contributed to the incident response and cooperation among Member States and EU Institutions, Bodies  and Agencies during some of the major security events and situations, such as the supply chain attack against  SolarWinds and the exploitation of critical vulnerabilities, such as those linked to the Log4J 2.0 library, as well  as monitoring cyber events related to COVID-19 situation. ENISA ensures active cooperation among key national  and European stakeholders, which has led to joint guidance on vulnerabilities and threats. Furthermore, ENISA  provided support both in the area of (a) incident impact assessment, (b) facilitation of technical handling of the  incidents and (c) sharing relevant situation information with stakeholders.  The Agency increased its efficiency to generate and consolidate information, to assess incidents and to facilitate  handling in this way contributed to the EU priority on situational awareness by supporting the consolidation  and exchange of information on strategic, tactical and technical levels to operational communities. I doing do  the Agency leveraged its internal capabilities, such as its operational toolsets and actively incorporating lesson  learning in its operational response processes and after-action reviews.  In addition the Agency contributed to the initial scoping of the potential Joint Cyber Unit by way of a number  of workshops on common situational awareness. The Agency together with EUIBAs established a roadmap of  deliverable’s for the EUIBAs contribution to the Union situational awareness.  In line with its mandate, ENISA initiated actions to set up the framework to assist Member States on the basis  of Article 7 of CSA, as such a proposal was developed for cybersecurity assistance mechanism with services and  a pool of experts.  Resources The resources for this activity as well as the distribution of talents with the right skillset will need to be assessed to  meet expectations. Recognising the critical role of this activity led to the creation of the operations and situational  awareness sector, within the Operational Cooperation Unit, in order to enable the Unit to focus on these tasks  and to develop the appropriate strategy and plan resources accordingy.  The Operational Cooperation Unit set-up a crisis response team (CRT) mechanism with the aim at helping  the Unit and agency to respond to large-scale cross-border incidents and facilitate inter-agency coordination.  The mechanism was piloted for the first time to respond to the Log4j event that led to an after action report.  The capabilities and the working methods of the mechanism are planned to be refined in the course of 2022.  The cyber situational awareness will require more resources than the ones currently assigned to address the  evolving cybersecurity threat landscape. The achievements of this activity, given the limited resources, would  not have been achieved without the proactive attitude and enthusiasm of staff members. In addition, when  ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2021 45  PART I. Achievements of the year  the mechanism for cybersecurity assistance will be put in place, it will require additional resources to function,  regardless of the actual delivery method. It is not foreseen for ENISA to be the delivery party for assistance to  Member States on its own but by harnessing an external pool of experts to ensure scalability of the service.  As with Activity 4, the activity manages several tools and platforms that require permanent availability, therefore  ensure continuation of services (for the end of the year and the beginning of the next) the services contracted  such as licences and maintenance are not synchronized with the annual budgetary cycle, which is the reason  for the carryover of budget from one year to the next. The unit is reviewing its budget planning to better align  service provisions to the financial/budgetary cycles in order to reduce the amounts carried over, however the  adjustments will most likely be noticeable in 2023 due to existing provisions and contracts. Following the above  mentioned review of budget planning, as of 2022 several actions managing tools and platforms are gathered  under the same output to optimise the coordination.  Overall assessment In line with the Agency’s mandate the foundations have been prepared for contributing to the Union common  situational awareness as well for its operational capability to be able to respond to Member States requests in  case of large scale cross-border incidents and events. The formalised new sector within the unit will provide  the focus required in this activity and in particular around operations and situational awareness to address the  increase needs for information exchange.  This was also one of the leading themes of the initial work undertaken  for the potential joint cyber unit as well the need for the agency to be able to respond to external requests.  The objectives for 2021 have been achieved however to meet increased stakeholder expectations and additional  demand the acquisition of additional human resources with diverse skillset is needed in order for the Agency  to increase capacity.  Given this assessment focus for the following year will be on organising the resources and strategy for operations  and situational awareness and transitioning to a service-oriented approach. This might require a reduction in  scope in some areas, due to the need to reassess the use of the tools and budget commitment to scale the delivery  of its services and establish metrics that measure effectiveness and efficacy of the actions that seek to achieve  the objectives of the activity. Additionally, the unit will focus on increasing its collaboration and partnership with  Member States in synergy with Activity 4, build on the work done through the initial scoping of the potential JCU,  in particular with EUIBAs services, as well as focusing on building trusted partnerships with the private sector.  Objectives  •  Develop effective incident response and cooperation  among Member States and EU institutions, including  cooperation between technical and political actors  during incidents or crises  •  Establish a common awareness of cyberincidents  and crises across the EU  •  Facilitate information exchange and cooperation,  both cross-layer and cross-border, between  Member States and with EU institutions  Link to strategic objective  (ENISA strategy)  •  Effective operational cooperation within  the EU in case of massive cyberincidents  •  Empowered and engaged communities across  the cybersecurity ecosystem  Results  •  Member States and institutions cooperating effectively during large-scale cross-border incidents or crises  • Public informed on a regular basis of important cybersecurity developments  • Stakeholders aware of the current cybersecurity situation  46  Outputs  5.1.  Generate and consolidate  information (including  for the general public)  on cybersituational  awareness, technical  situational reports,  incident reports  and information on  threats, and support  the consolidation and  exchange of information  at strategic, tactical and  technical levels  Outcome  ENISA produced cybersituational awareness with a focus on  cyberincidents in the EU area but also across the world.  ENISA’s cybersituational awareness services were provided to EUIBAs  and authorities in Member States through regular weekly reports  (ENISA’s weekly open-source intelligence (OSINT) report) and ad hoc  threat research.  ENISA significantly increased the weekly OSINT report outreach to recipients,  with its OSINT reports now being sent to approximately 600 recipients.  In 2021, ENISA launched a new pilot product, the joint rapid report,  in close cooperation with CERT-EU.  In parallel, ENISA continued improving its tools (Open Cyber Situational  Awareness Machine) and delivered new ones (situational awareness  team toolbox) that will enable better data ingestion and increase the  production throughput.  ENISA’s data collection in this area also represents the main source of  information for ENISA’s long-standing threat landscape reports.  Main outcomes of the work:  • 49 weekly OSINT reports sent to 500–600 recipients;  •  37 executive summaries on healthcare (linked to the COVID-19  pandemic) sent to the European Commission;  •  16 ad hoc threat research papers shared with CERT-EU, DG Connect,  EEAS, EC3 and the general public;  •  20 joint rapid reports (including updates), done in cooperation with  CERT-EU, for senior stakeholders.  2021 was a foundational year for the agency’s situational awareness  capability. While, with limited resources, the Agency was able to fulfil to  its objective, however appetite for such capabilities have increased for  common situational awareness. As such the unit established a sector in the  last quarter of 2021 to focus on this capability and additional resources  planned in the course of 2022.  Going forward the unit will establish the service portfolio with supporting  tools and / or external services.  5.2.  Support technical and  operational cooperation,  incident response  coordination during  crises and activities with  the CSIRTs Network,  and CERT-EU, EC3, EEAS  and EDA EU-wide crisis  communication planning  ENISA made progress on actions to support effective incident response  and cooperation among Member States and EU institutions during  incidents or crisis. This was achieved by building on the survey  of Blueprint stakeholders and follow-up interviews with CSIRTs  Network members.  ENISA produced deliverables (restricted for the moment to the  CSIRTs Network members) on the mapping of secure communication  channels and a methodology proposal for evaluating channels. Several  supporting activities were carried out, such as support for the Crisis  Communications Management Guide (connected to output 4.3); input  to the EUIBAs SOP draft (connected to output 4.3); input to CSIRTs  ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2021 47  PART I. Achievements of the year  5.3.  Provide assistance and  support on the basis  of Article 7(4) and (7)  of the CSA  Network SOPs and support of the CSIRTs Network SOP working  group (connected to output 4.1); and support for the CSIRTS Network  communications channels check (connection to output 4.1).  To improve interactions with the stakeholders relevant to this activity, this  output was discontinued in the 2022 work programme, whilst the actions  continue across other outputs in the activity.    ENISA launched activities in order to set up the framework for the  assistance of Member States on the basis of Article 7 of CSA. Such  assistance (at the request of Member States) was meant to cover the  assessment of incidents and to facilitate the technical handling of  incidents or crises. A proposal for assistance was created, covering  a cybersecurity assistance mechanism associated with certain services  and a pool of experts. Within this output based on structured interviews  with Blueprint actors, ENISA produced the following deliverables  (available at the moment to CSIRTs Network members): guidelines;  processes and procedures; pool of experts’ structure. A pilot project was  carried out to test the operational activity of the assistance mechanism,  and involved testing the provision of assistance with limited scope for  three CSIRTs Network members. Results of the deliverables and lessons  learned from the pilot project will be used in the further development of  the assistance mechanism.  The actions carried out in 2021 set up the basis for a framework to provide  assistance and support according to Article 7 of CSA. The outcomes of these  actions will be used in organize the assistance mechanism with the aim to  provide assistance and support to Member States. The mechanism to be  implemented will require additional resources in order to asses, manage,  and evaluate both the requests and the technical services to be delivered.

More specifically, ENISA assisted the Commission on the governance of the framework,  promulgated three cybersecurity certification schemes with different maturity levels and prepared its  online services on certification.  Achievements By the end of 2021, ENISA had made meaningful contributions to the EU cybersecurity certification framework by  assisting the Commission with regard to discharging its duties concerning governance (European Cybersecurity  Certification Group (ECCG) and Stakeholders Cybersecurity Certification Group (SCCG)) and further processing  draft candidate cybersecurity certification schemes in terms of planning and content development. ENISA thus  served the strategic objective of a ‘high level of trust in secure digital solutions’ by reinforcing this aim with new  components of certification schemes, some of which have not yet been adopted and implemented by Member  States. Achievements include:  • the conclusion of the EU common criteria certification scheme with the opinion of the ECCG;  • the advancement of the EU cloud services certification scheme in a way that allows finalisation in early 2022;  • the launching of the ad hoc working group (AHWG) on the EU5G certification scheme;  • the kick-off of the ECCG subgroup on encryption;  • the conclusion of the Union rolling work programme at SCCG level;  •  advances in the design and implementation of the workflow and application programming interface for  certificate publication, as well as an analysis for a cybersecurity certification label.  Further enhancements to the certification approach led to adding guidance, pilots and methodological  components. The multiannual component of the Agency’s programming document provided further guidance  and the context for the overall pursuits of the year. During the reporting year, ENISA improved on its systems and  services by consolidating the use of collaboration tools of importance for the interactions with external experts.  To this end, it developed and implemented a web-based service for the Member States concerning certification.  Resources While all activities were duly resourced, the consumption of the budget allocated to cybersecurity certification  lagged because of a late decision in relation to the support and preparation for the 5G EU scheme. As a result,  the allocated resources were not consumed in full, since ENISA accommodated requirements tailored to  a multistakeholder environment where consultations and time constraints played a key role.  The main drivers for providing budget estimates in 2024 onwards will depend on the pace of implementation  of the Union rolling work programme on cybersecurity certification (i.e. production costs), the concentration of  actions to monitor adopted schemes (i.e. maintenance costs) and the transition to an online platform to meet  stakeholders’ requirements (i.e. community service costs). ENISA is therefore processing its own quantified  approach along these lines.  Appropriations carried forward served the purpose of bridging the multiannual cybersecurity certification work  from one year to the next, while serving the principle of annual budgets. The small amount carried forward does  not affect the ability of the unit to perform its tasks in 2022.  ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2021 49  PART I. Achievements of the year  Overall assessment Cybersecurity certification provides a focal point for the industry and, as the KPIs suggest, increasingly the  assistance and support stakeholders need including due guidance for the public authorities concerned, when  an adopted scheme becomes available in such a way that it can be implemented and further enforced. The  cybersecurity certification framework remained high on the stakeholders’ agenda during the reporting year,  as demonstrated by the robust support to and interest in ENISA activities as well as the results of KPI metrics.  Within the boundaries of its competence, ENISA’s timely response and coherent production of schemes and  related deliverables and outputs supported the cybersecurity certification framework.    Objectives  •  Trusted ICT products, services and processes  •  Increased use and uptake of European  cybersecurity certification  Link to strategic objective  (ENISA strategy)  •  High level of trust in secure digital solutions  •  Empowered and engaged communities across  the cybersecurity ecosystem  Results  • Support for schemes chosen to run under the European cybersecurity certification framework  •  Certified ICT products, services and processes preferred by consumers and, where relevant, OESs and DSPs   Outputs  6.1.  Draft candidate  cybersecurity certification  schemes and contribute  to the establishment  of the schemes  Outcome  ENISA worked in response to Commission requests for  cybersecurity certification schemes as follows.  EU5G.  •  In coordination with the European Commission, ENISA established  the AHWG to define the candidate EU5G scheme. The AHWG on  EU5G is formed of three preparatory work streams mapping the  request and seeking to leverage on a methodology meant to identify  certification gaps. While ENISA worked closely with public authorities  and the Commission in the preparation phase, kick-offs were  organised in Q4 2021 with over 100 participants involved (50 % from  public authorities and with broad private sector participation).  •  During the setting up of the AHWG, ENISA engaged with external  experts into the preparation of reference documentation for the  important activity of risk and gap analysis of work stream 3 of phase  1 of the scheme’s development. ENISA also carried out a pilot on the  newly defined methodology for sectoral cybersecurity assessments,  to validate its further use for the EU5G project  Cybersecurity certification conference  •  ENISA organised its annual cybersecurity conference in December  2021 in Athens. Keynote speakers and panellists discussed  cybersecurity certification including changes in the market, approach  to emerging technologies (AI, 5G), link with standardisation and the  impact on end user consumers. The conference attracted about  50  25 guest speakers, 50 attendees on site and over 1 200 attendees  online (1 800 registrations).  European cloud services  •  ENISA continued working on the request of the Commission for  an EUCS scheme. In Q1, a public review was launched with several  presentations to the public, followed by an analysis of the feedback.  •  The results of the survey led to revisions of the first draft candidate  scheme, and in particular of the part on requirements. Subsequently  these requirements were proposed to CEN-CENELEC Joint Technical  Committee 13 for the development of a technical specification.  Additional content was developed, in particular about extension  profiles and requirements for Conformity Assessment Bodies.  •  In Q3/Q4, EUCS prompted by the Member States, ENISA examined  aspects related to digital sovereignty and independence from non-EU  laws; currently a thematic group is seeking to consolidate an approach  to guidance received from the Member States and the ECCG.  Certification  •  In 2021, the Agency continued the same high pace of execution of  cybersecurity certification requests; as ENISA is gaining experience  and maturity, adding concurrent actions will probably take  precedence over a high frequency of actions.  •  Drafting candidate cybersecurity certification schemes and  contributing to the establishment of the schemes are essential  actions to underpin and develop the EU cybersecurity certification  framework; accordingly, this output can remain. Care needs to be  taken to dedicate resources to this output in such a way that they  reflect the actual level of execution of the Union’s rolling work  programme or equivalent request.  6.2.  Implementation and  maintenance of the  established schemes  including evaluation  of adopted schemes  and participation in  peer review  EUCC  • In relation to the Commission’s request for a cybersecurity  certification scheme on EUCC, the Agency supported the Commission  in prepare the first draft implementing act on the candidate EUCC,  which was discussed at the ECCG in June 2021, and it has remained  work in progress since then.  • During the reporting year, a guidance strategy on the EUCC  scheme was developed by the Agency with a view to supporting the  preparations for the implementation of EUCC and the transition  from SOG-IS certification to EUCC. In line with the prioritisation  foreseen by the ECCG, development of guidance on the following  started in 2021: accreditation, certification transition, taxonomy,  security of information and certification application forms. Pilots  were therefore resorted to for the validation of certain provisions  of the EUCC; this part of the work is still ongoing.  EUCS  • In EUCS, eight experiments were organised over the summer  to verify the feasibility of some of the new measures introduced  in the EUCS draft candidate scheme. Stakeholders from eight  Member States and from the United States were involved, including  ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2021 51  PART I. Achievements of the year  6.3.  Support statutory  bodies in discharging  their duties with respect  to governance roles  and tasks  cloud providers, Conformity Assessment Bodies and National  Cybersecurity Certification Authorities, and the results were used  to enhance the draft candidate scheme.  • Work was initiated on the development of guidance, in particular  around the new requirements on controls. This first phase of work  was focused on the format of the information required in the  guidance, and an initial version of the guidance was developed  across five categories, representing around 25 % of the overall  requirements of the EUCS.  Consequently, ENISA managed to be ahead of the planning in terms  of content regarding the EUCC; ENISA has been right on track with  EUCS and it launched the EU5G scheme, giving an overall picture of the  span of its involvement in relation to the EU cybersecurity certification  framework. It is also worth mentioning that ENISA further contributed  to early policy considerations of the European Digital Identity Wallet in  support of the Commission’s efforts.  In relation to the output on the implementation and maintenance of  the established schemes, including evaluation of adopted schemes  and participation in peer reviews, ENISA has taken a dynamic approach  and anticipated actions that facilitate the gradual implementation  of schemes. This output is essential for maintenance, which will be  the culmination of actions starting from the adoption of the first  scheme onwards. As such it needs to remain and be further supported  with commensurate resources that reflect the expected pace of  implementation of schemes adopted.  The European Cybersecurity Certification Group (ECCG)  • ENISA assisted the Commission in its efforts to operate the ECCG  and enable the ECCG to provide its views on the Union rolling  work programme.  • The Agency supported the Commission to set up an ECCG subgroup  on cryptography, on developing guidance on cryptographic  mechanisms to be embedded in ICT products and services,  and on developing related evaluation methodologies.  • Regarding the further development of the EUCS cybersecurity  certification scheme that started at the beginning of 2020,  a dedicated subgroup meeting was organised in March to allow  Member States to discuss and provide input to the Agency on the  mitigation of risks by security requirements related to independence  from non-EU law for EUCS, an element of the EUCS scheme that was  at an advanced stage at the end of 2021.  • Regarding the main projects related to the market, certification  and standardisation, regular updates were provided to the ECCG  to support the ECCG in its advisory role to the Commission and the  Agency on the EU cybersecurity certification framework and the  schemes under development.  The Stakeholder Cybersecurity Certification Group (SCCG)  • With support from ENISA, the SCCG assisted the Commission to draft  the Union rolling work programme, identifying the strategic priorities  for European cybersecurity certification schemes and future areas  52  for certification; consequently, the SCCG provided its opinion  in February 2021.  • ENISA assisted the SCCG and the Commission in defining the KPIs  and metrics for the future evaluation of the implementation phase  and the first of operational phase of the European cybersecurity  certification schemes.  • Regarding the main projects related to the market, certification  and standardisation, regular updates were provided to the SCCG  to support the SCCG in its advisory role to the Commission and the  Agency. In particular, they covered the developments on the EUCC  cybersecurity certification scheme for ICT products and the European  cybersecurity certification scheme for EUCS.  As this output serves the governance of the cybersecurity certification  framework and consumes no financial resources as such, it is required  that it stay as is. Small amounts of resources can be dedicated  indirectly in relation to output 6.1.  6.4.  Development and  maintenance of necessary  tools for an efficient and  effective EU cybersecurity  certification framework  (including a certification  website and collaboration  platform  ENISA website dedicated to certification  • With the support of selected Member States, ENISA further designed  and developed the IT system to support the requirement for  a website dedicated to the promotion of European cybersecurity  certification schemes, European cybersecurity certificates and EU  statements of conformity in accordance with Article 50 of the CSA,  as well as related information.  • The proposed approach includes a workflow and an application  programming interface to facilitate the distribution of objects that  ensured integrity and authentication.  Core Service Platform for EU Cybersecurity  Certification Stakeholders  • ENISA supported the European Commission to develop  and implement the Core Service Platform for EU Cybersecurity  Certification Stakeholders. The platform is part of the ‘support  for set-up of a cooperation mechanism for national cybersecurity  certification authorities envisaged by the Connecting Europe Facility  2019–2020 working programme and managed by the European  Commission. The activity started in October 2021 with three  workshops (one with ENISA, and the other two with the stakeholders  proposed by ENISA, who were from the SCCG, the ECCG and  the EUCC and EUCS AHWGs). ENISA provided the first use cases  for the basic layer of the platform.  Tools and a website are essential conditions for the success of  a cybersecurity certification framework. There is a need to reach  maturity and deliver the service in order to demonstrate the value  from the investment made and the engagement that stakeholders  have demonstrated in relation to this service. Looking beyond the  horizon, further resources will be necessary to further customise  and support the emerging technology platform when the Commission  makes it available to ENISA.

As the cybersecurity certification framework remains in its early stages, ENISA obtained  responses through a survey concerning the intention of the respondents to use a scheme. The responses are varied but should be  regarded as favourable on balance because a significant portion of the market views positively the prospect of an EU certification  scheme and intends to benefit from it when it becomes available. In the future, when a scheme is adopted and following user  education, the response rate is likely to change.  54  ACTIVITY 7 Supporting the European  cybersecurity market and industry  Under Activity 7, ENISA served the strategic objective of a ‘high level of trust in secure digital solutions’  by launching the cybersecurity market outputs; meaningfully associating standardisation and certification,  notably on 5G standardisation; analysing the prospective cybersecurity label; and reporting on  vulnerabilities for certified products, services and processes. As announced by European Commission  President von der Leyen in her State of the Union Address in September 2021, the Commission was to  proceed with an act to establish common cybersecurity rules for digital products and associated services  that are placed on the market across the European Union. ENISA contributed to this broader policy goal by  analysing the cybersecurity market of connected devices.  Achievements ENISA kicked off the cybersecurity market output in an effort to gain a meaningful role in a new analysis  and recommendations domain. ENISA reasserted its position in the area of standardisation with a newly  implemented approach to private standardisation organisations, and further collaboration with European  standardisation bodies; meaningful content was developed to mark gaps. ENISA also developed a concept for  a cybersecurity certification label, based on an analysis; it also launched a discussion forum that contributes to the  analysis of vulnerabilities for certified products, services and processes. While certification remained a background  theme across these outputs, ENISA sought to service other priorities of the Agency under Activity 7, notably risk  assessment, connected devices and cooperation with policy and awareness raising. Achievements include:  • a market analysis framework and implementation thereof on connected devices;  • reviews of risk assessment and 5G standards (including O-RAN);  • an analysis of cybersecurity labelling approaches;  • guidance on vulnerabilities of certified products, services and processes.  Resources With three outputs out of four being new, delivering on Activity 7 remained a challenge. Outputs 7.1 and 7.2  could potentially benefit from a reshuffle of in-house capacity to provide the resources needed in order to meet  the requirements.  Appropriations carried forward served the purpose of responding to policy priorities of the Commission and thus  the Agency in relation to the European Digital Identity Wallet; subsequently deliverables are expected in early  2022. A small amount was directed towards the annual standardisation conference that takes place in Q1, while  most arrangements are sorted out beforehand. The amount carried forward does not negatively affect the ability  of the unit to perform its tasks in 2022.  Overall assessment Under the CSA, Activity 7 can gradually grow, should cybersecurity market analysis start covering broader areas  and shift to a transversal service pattern. Standardisation has equally strong potential to delve into a dense set  of requirements and enhance the ability of the Agency to influence cybersecurity standards in fulfilling its role in  cybersecurity certification. Both these areas could benefit from a moderate increase in resources to better cope  with the growing demand of stakeholders for analytical market data and a flow of standardisation requirements  alike. Further adjustments concerning output 7.3 could allow best practices to be transversely analysed and  proposed to stakeholders across the market, certification and standardisation, and outreach policy areas  (e.g. the European cybersecurity index). With regard to output 7.4, which serves, inter alia, the purpose of  a discussion forum on its subject matter, no changes are proposed hereinafter, except for a modest adjustment  in resources, as appropriate.  ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2021 55  PART I. Achievements of the year  Objectives  •  Improve conditions for the functioning of the  internal market  •  Foster a robust European cybersecurity industry  and market  Link to strategic objective  (ENISA strategy)  •  High level of trust in secure digital solutions  •  Empowered and engaged communities across  the cybersecurity ecosystem  Results  •  Where relevant, contributions towards a more competitive European cybersecurity industry, small  and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and start-ups  Outputs  7.1.  Market analysis of the  main trends in the  cybersecurity market  on both the demand  and the supply sides  Outcome  ENISA initiated its activities in analysing the cybersecurity market,  with the aim of contributing to a more targeted, market-driven  decision-making process for the conception, launching and  maintenance of cybersecurity products, services and processes within  the EU. The Agency developed the ENISA cybersecurity market analysis  framework, which describes how EU cybersecurity market analyses  can be performed, and it has been introduced as a building block to be  gradually developed further.  • ENISA carried out an analysis of the supply of and demand for  internet of things (IoT) cybersecurity in distribution grids, and made  detailed suggestions on how this market might further evolve,  as a proof of concept.  • During the reporting year, the Agency also established the AHWG  on the EU cybersecurity market, which is supporting ENISA in  analysing market trends and segments, with a focus on cybersecurity  solutions to meet the dynamic market needs of stakeholders: ENISA  Cybersecurity Market Analysis Framework (ECSMAF)  (https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/enisa-cybersecurity- market-analysis-framework-ecsmaf); EU Cybersecurity Market  Analysis – IoT in Distribution Grids (https://www.enisa.europa.eu/ publications/eu-cybersecurity-market-analysis-iot-in-distribution- grid); call for the establishing of the AHWG on the EU cybersecurity  market (https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/standards/adhoc_wg_ calls/ad-hoc-working-group-on-cybersecurity-market).  The market analysis output has the potential to become a flagship  activity and the centre of gravity of a range of analyses, data feeds  and stakeholders’ involvement, across a range of target market areas.  The market analysis framework, slightly revisited, could remain the  centrepiece, while focus would shift across focal areas. A small but  focused range of services could be developed thereafter. An annual  conference could bring stakeholders together in a flexible arrangement.  56  7.2.  Monitoring developments  in related areas of  standardisation, analysis  of gaps in standardisation  and establishment and  take-up of European and  international standards  for risk management  ENISA also endeavoured to fulfil its tasks on standardisation as follows.  • It developed a rapport with European standardisation organisations  / standards development organisations / private initiatives. ENISA  implemented the tasks stemming from its standardisation strategy,  in particular through activities whereby ENISA acts as an agent  influencing standardisation and as a collaborating partner to the  standards development organisations and initiatives. Concrete  action consisted in launching or tightening relations with relevant  technical committees of standardisation bodies (European  Telecommunications Standards Institute technical committees on  cybersecurity and on electronic signatures and infrastructures; CEN- CENELEC Joint Technical Committee 13; International Organization  for Standardization (ISO) / International Electrotechnical Commission  subcommittee 27; International Digital Cooperation project on ICT  standardisation), and with private initiatives (GSMA, 3rd Generation  Partnership Project, Global Platform), and organising in collaboration  with the European Telecommunications Standards Institute and  CEN-CENELEC the cybersecurity standardisation conference (over  2 400 registrations) and participation in others. The Agency was active  in the development of the rolling plan for ICT standardisation, and  the feasibility study of the future standards in support of the CSA,  and proposed to the standardisation community new work items for  specific standards supporting certification, which were accepted by  CEN-CENELEC Joint Technical Committee 13 (methodology sectoral  cybersecurity assessment; EUCS controls; accreditation criteria).  • Analysis of standardisation requirements – risk management.  ENISA drew up a coherent overview of published risk management  standards addressing aspects of risk management and subsequently  describing methodologies and tools that can be used to conform  with or implement them. Based on a comprehensive inventory  of standards in the area, the study provides guidance on their  availability and outlines possible gaps, proposing concrete activities  to close these gaps (https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/risk- management-standards).  • Analysis of standardisation requirements – 5G. The Agency prepared  a study on 5G standards, in parallel with the preparations for the  work on 5G certification scheme. The ambition of this report was  to outline the contribution of standardisation to the mitigation  of technical risks, and therefore to trust and resilience, in the 5G  ecosystem, understood as a multidimensional space encompassing  not only technological and functional domains, but also the related  technology life-cycle processes and stakeholders (https://www.enisa. europa.eu/publications/5g-cybersecurity-standards).  • The Agency produced a study on O-pen-RAN standardisation,  focusing on the specification development process in this area.  The study was initiated at the request of the Member States and  the Commission.  Standardisation has been a flagship activity and it is fortunate that  it has gradually been integrated with certification. Further fusion  between these two areas will certainly assist reaching better policy  outcomes and benefit the cybersecurity certification framework.  The annual conference serves as a stakeholder platform to pass key  messages about cooperation and content.  ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2021 57  PART I. Achievements of the year  7.3.  Guidelines and good  practices on cybersecurity  certification requirements  for ICT products, services  and processes  7.4.  Monitoring and  documenting the  dependencies and  vulnerabilities of ICT  products and services  In terms of labelling for EU cybersecurity certification, ENISA drew up  key requirements and consolidated experience from other similar  initiatives concerning cybersecurity labels. This stands as a first step  towards labelling for certified ICT products, services and processes.  Around 50 stakeholders supported a dedicated thematic group, and  this output was presented to and discussed by ENISA governing bodies  (ECCG, SCCG, national liaison officers (NLOs)).  At the ENISA 2021 cybersecurity certification conference, a panel  discussed current IoT labelling initiatives and monitoring developments  beyond the EU; views were also exchanged with the National Institute  of Standards and Technology.  While labelling is reaching a turning point, good practices have the  potential for dynamic growth across a range of areas. This adjusted  output, remains for this purpose.  In terms of vulnerabilities of certified ICT, ENISA assessed the impact  of certification on the handling of vulnerabilities, from the CVD process  and certification status points of view. A thematic group supported this  output, and it identified the complete set of requirements related to  vulnerability handling in the CSA, certification schemes (EUCC, EUCS),  NIS and relevant standards. Two scenarios were developed to analyse  the gaps between the different requirements and to define a roadmap.  The AHWGs’ joint session and the ENISA governing bodies (ECCG,  SCCG) had an opportunity to review and comment on this output.  While low key, this output remains topical in the market and  certification area; as it is fit for purpose, no changes are expected.  58  Key performance indicators Recognition of ENISA’s supporting role for  participants in the European cybersecurity  marketa  Unit of  measure-  ment  Frequency Data source Results  7.1. Number of market analyses, guidelines and good practices issued by ENISA  Cybersecurity market analysis framework Number Annual Reports 2  7.2. Uptake of lessons learned / recommendations from ENISA reports  Percentage of respondents interested in using  ENISA’s good practice on market analyses  % Annual Survey 87 % high and  medium interest  Percentage of respondents interested in using  ENISA’s standards mapping related to 5G  % Annual Survey 84 % high and  medium interest  Percentage of respondents interested in using  ENISA’s standards mapping related to the IoT  % Annual Survey 88 % high and  medium interest  Percentage of respondents interested in  using ENISA’s risk-based approach for their  cybersecurity certification activities  % Annual Survey 72 % high and  medium interest  Percentage of respondents interested  in using ENISA’s consolidated certification  labelling process  % Annual Survey 84 % high and  medium interest  Percentage of respondents interested in using  ENISA’s vulnerability management process for  certified products, services and processes  % Annual Survey 82 % high and  medium interest  7.3. Stakeholder satisfaction with the added  value and quality of ENISA’s work  % Biennial Survey N/A  Allocated FTEs as per  SPD based on full  establishment  at year-end 2021  9 Actual used FTEs 6.50  Planned budget  (direct costs only)  EUR 490 000 Consumed budget  (direct costs only)  EUR 450 894  Of which carried over to 2022 EUR 69 996  N/A, not applicable.  a The KPIs of Activity 7 allow the Agency to reaffirm its role and obtain feedback on its efforts to take a new standpoint on cybersecurity.  ENISA has built a long-standing relationship with stakeholders on cybersecurity standardisation, and the outcome permeates through  the results of the survey in terms of stakeholder value.  ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2021 59  PART I. Achievements of the year  60  ACTIVITY 8 Knowledge on emerging cybersecurity  challenges and opportunities  This activity intends to provide strategic long-term analysis, guidance and advice on the cybersecurity  threat landscape, emerging technologies and cybersecurity challenges. It also serves the purpose of providing  topic-specific recommendations and general assessments on the impact of cybersecurity’s requirements and  challenges. The activity also focuses on identifying and giving advice in relation to cybersecurity research and  innovation, and thus contributes to the relevant EU strategic agenda.  In line with the strategic objective of efficient and effective cybersecurity information and knowledge  management for Europe, the activity builds on aggregating and analysing information across the ecosystem  (legal, regulatory, technical, societal, etc.), and leverages expertise to provide relevant analyses. In doing so,  information from other activities (e.g. NIS investments under Activity 1, output 1.1, incident reporting under  Activity 2, output 2.5, and situational awareness under Activity 5, output 5.1) is consolidated under Activity 8  to promote relevant analyses and give recommendations. A prime example is the work on the cybersecurity  index that will pull information from across all activities in order to assess the level of cybersecurity maturity  of Member States. Moreover, the analyses and recommendations under Activity 8 feed into the work and  prioritisation of topics of other activities, with a notable example being the threat landscape that guides the  selection of topics for training and exercises (Activity 3). An effective cycle of information and knowledge  management is thus achieved by consolidating information across ENISA’s ecosystem of activities, analysing  them and feeding back to the activities of ENISA.  Achievements During the reporting period, ENISA worked on various fronts in terms of consolidating information, analysing it  and providing analyses and recommendations to serve stakeholders’ expectations. The Agency worked closely  with the stakeholders’ communities (one established and two new ad hoc working groups, as well as a subgroup  of the NLO Network).  ENISA has set the grounds and followed a multiannual perspective in the delivery of Activity 8, engaging in the  design of the EU cybersecurity index, the annual threat landscape and the supply chain attacks threat landscape,  the methodology on identifying foresight challenges, the design of the information hub (infohub), the work on AI  and securing machine learning. Besides, ENISA provided continuous support to the EU research and innovation  agenda, and in particular to the ECCC, by helping with the identification of research and innovation priorities. All  those projects have long-term plans and adhere to a service-oriented approach to cater for stakeholders’ needs  in an agile manner.  In terms of cohesion and vision, the work of Activity 8 looks at cybersecurity information and knowledge across  the timeline, by looking into past and present data (threat landscapes and cybersecurity index) to understand the  status quo and identify trends for the future (foreseen and emerging challenges), and use these to feed into the  research and development agenda (research and innovation priorities), with the aim of raising awareness using  a procedural knowledge management framework (infohub). The multiannual perspective followed in Activity 8  (with works on foresight, the cybersecurity index and the infohub in particular), having a 3-year time horizon, was  necessary to allow a level of maturity to be attained internally. These particular works were new to ENISA and in  this respect – and to allow for synchronisation between the various pieces of work – adequate time was needed  to allow ENISA to build its capabilities, and to allow acceptance by the Agency’s stakeholders to grow steadily  and in a participatory manner. Both latter aspects of stakeholder engagement are deemed necessary for the  successful implementation of and buy-in to projects such as the cybersecurity index and the infohub.  Accordingly, targeted information and recommendations are provided to stakeholders at various levels and in  a timely fashion to support decision-making and ensure that a solid and future-proof view of cybersecurity is  taken into account. The timeliness of the information is an area that can be further improved, by moving towards  real-time mapping of the cybersecurity threat landscape, which would require additional efforts on the part of  ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2021 61  PART I. Achievements of the year  ENISA to continuously analyse and identify recommendations. Along these lines, the agency is working towards  consolidating information from output 2.5 (annual incident reporting) with other information sources, mostly  open-source, frequently used in the mapping of threat landscapes, and will streamline relevant efforts towards  the consolidation of information.  In identifying the complex nature of outputs under Activity 8 (e.g. output 8.1 addresses the cybersecurity index,  foresight and recommendations on future and emerging challenges), already in the 2022 SPD the Management  Board of ENISA undertook corrective actions to make the structure more lean and appropriate to satisfy its  strategic objectives. In addition, realising the opportunity for synergies with the work on incident reporting under  Activity 2 (output 2.5), already in 2022 this work will be considered under Activity 8 to promote cross-fertilisation  and integrated knowledge management concerning the threat landscape. More opportunities concerning the  streamlining of knowledge management exist, notably with the work on situational awareness under Activity  5, and the Agency is internally promoting closer ties between the two work streams by means of consolidated  tooling requirements and by exploring the potential of common analysis techniques.  Resources Budget implementation for Activity 8 reached 95 % at the end of the reporting year. Considering the impact  of the pandemic on the planning of physical events and travel expenses linked to business travel, this  implementation came as a very positive result for the Agency.  In terms of FTE resources, Activity 8 faced the challenge of having two horizontal teams, with team members  contributing various percentages towards the team and one operational unit working together to meet the  objectives.  The KPIs of Activity 8 are diverse in nature. KPI 8.1 deals with the visibility and impact of the infohub, which, given  its multiannual development plan, did not become operational during the reporting year. Therefore, KPI 8.1 was  not assessed in 2021, since only the design of the infohub and the knowledge management framework were  introduced in 2021. KPI 8.2 assesses the quantity and depth of ENISA’s work in terms of analyses, challenges and  recommendations. With an average of 36 analyses, challenges and recommendations identified in each of the  eight reports considered, the depth of ENISA’s work in identifying cybersecurity challenges, highlighting relevant  recommendations and providing analyses is considered significant. KPI 8.3 involves a biennial stakeholder  satisfaction survey, which will be held at the end of 2022.  Overall assessment Activity 8 met its objectives during the reporting year. KPIs revealed that ENISA had a notable impact  in identifying recommendations, analyses and challenges, and that it delivered the expected results.  However, the objective of increasing Member State and EU resilience and preparedness for handling future  cybersecurity challenges and opportunities remains difficult to assess. At this point in time, the Agency expects  the EU cybersecurity index to serve as a benchmark and to therefore help assess how this objective will  be met in the future. ENISA expects to analyse and process the results of the cybersecurity index, although  more resources will be required than those of 2021, in order to develop and maintain the index during the  coming years.  62  Objectives  •  Identify and understand future cybersecurity  challenges and opportunities, and assess the  interlinks between cybersecurity and relevant  disrupting technologies in the current and future  digital transformation  •  Increase the resilience and preparedness of  Member States’ and the EU’s in handling future  cybersecurity challenges and opportunities  •  Increase knowledge and information for  specialised cybersecurity communities  Link to strategic objective  (ENISA strategy)  •  Foresight on emerging and future  cybersecurity challenges  •  Efficient and effective cybersecurity information  and knowledge management for Europe  •  Empowered and engaged communities across  the cybersecurity ecosystem  Results  •  Decisions about cybersecurity are future-proof and take account of the trends, developments  and knowledge across the ecosystem  •  Stakeholders receive relevant and timely information for policymaking and decision-making  Outputs  8.1.  Identification, collection  and analysis of present  and emerging challenges  (e.g. technological,  economic or societal) in  cybersecurity (including  developing and  maintaining a European  Cybersecurity Index)  Outcome  • In 2021, ENISA commenced work on designing, developing and  maintaining a European Cybersecurity Index. A multi-annual plan  was launched, including the design and development, the piloting,  and eventually the deployment and maintenance of the index.  A dedicated subgroup of ENISA’s NLO Network was established  to continuously engage with the Member States.  • In 2021, ENISA worked together with Member States and delivered  the following internal reports and studies:  –  analysis of existing cybersecurity capabilities assessment  frameworks and indexes;  –  a set of EU cybersecurity indicators;  –  empirical validation of indicators and domains;  –  the EU Cybersecurity Index Framework version 1.0  (a ‘live’ document);  –  requirements for cybersecurity index supporting tools.  • Concerning analysis of present and emerging challenges, in  the course of 2021 ENISA worked on two topics, namely AI and  cryptology with a focus on post-quantum cryptography (PQC). To  this end, with the support of the ENISA ad hoc AI working group, the  Agency delivered a report on securing machine learning algorithms,  following up from the recommendations of the ENISA AI threat  landscape that was published in 2020. With regard to cryptology, the  Agency worked on the issue of post-quantum integration and crypto  assets, and relevant reports will be published in 2022.  ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2021 63  PART I. Achievements of the year  • In 2021, ENISA laid the foundations for foresight, namely to identify,  collect and analyse present and emerging challenges across various  dimensions (e.g. technological, economic or societal). To this end,  the Agency established an ad hoc working group on foresight for  emerging and future cybersecurity challenges.  • In 2021, ENISA worked with the Foresight Working Group and the  futures and foresight community to develop a methodological  process to apply foresight to cybersecurity. The result of this work  was published and will serve as guidance for the foresight efforts of  ENISA and other cybersecurity organisations in the future.  • Securing Machine Learning Algorithms (https://www.enisa.europa. eu/publications/securing-machine-learning-algorithms).  • Foresight Challenges (https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/ foresight-challenges).  Output 8.1 addresses the cybersecurity index, foresight and  recommendations on future and emerging challenges. Already in  the 2022 SPD the Management Board of ENISA undertook corrective  actions to make the structure leaner and more appropriate to satisfy its  strategic objectives. Accordingly, the work on the index will be part of  a dedicated output, and the work on foresight and emerging challenges  also has a dedicated output in the 2022 SPD.  8.2.  Provide targeted as  well as general reports,  recommendations,  analysis and other actions  in relation to future  cybersecurity scenarios  and threat landscapes  (incident response  landscape mapping for  NIS directive sectors)  During 2021, ENISA restructured the delivery of threat landscapes by  establishing an ad hoc working group on cyberthreat landscapes and  laying the groundwork for a transparent and public methodology.  By incorporating a plethora of cyberthreat intelligence sources and  following a service-oriented approach, the work on threat landscapes  increased in confidence.  • In 2021, the ENISA Annual Threat Landscape was published for the  ninth time and an additional thematic threat landscape on supply  chain attacks was also published:  –  ENISA Threat Landscape 2021 (https://www.enisa.europa.eu/ publications/enisa-threat-landscape-2021);  –  ENISA Threat Landscape for Supply Chain Attacks (https://www.enisa. europa.eu/publications/threat-landscape-for-supply-chain-attacks).  • Building on its work on supporting operational cooperation across  EU over recent years, in 2021 ENISA conducted a study on mapping  incident response capabilities and developments in a sector to which  the NISD dedicates attention, namely the healthcare sector. The  report provided practical recommendations on future developments  in incident response in the healthcare sector:  –  CSIRT Capabilities in Healthcare Sector (https://www.enisa.europa. eu/publications/csirt-capabilities-in-healthcare-sector).  The work on threat landscapes was highly appreciated by the  stakeholders and contributed greatly to the strategic objective of  efficient and effective knowledge management in Europe. Realising  the opportunity for synergies with the work on incident reporting  under Activity 2 (output 2.5) has already been integrated into Activity  8 during the 2022 work programme to promote cross-fertilisation and  integrated knowledge management concerning the threat landscape.  64  8.3.  Develop and maintain  a portal (information  hub), a one-stop shop  for organising and  making available to  the public information  on cybersecurity,  and establishment of  a procedural framework  to support knowledge  management activities  8.4.  Support EU research and  development programmes  and activities of European  competence centres,  including the four EU  pilot projects for the  European Cybersecurity  Competence Centre and  Network of National  Coordination Centres  ENISA opted for a multi-annual approach to deliver the infohub.  In 2021, the agency established an initial procedural framework to  support the knowledge management activities of a future infohub.  This included the development of relevant taxonomies, templates and  potential processes for knowledge acquisition and validation, setting  out the baseline procedures and processes that will be considered for  integration in the technical specifications upon which the development  of the prototype portal will be built.  Moreover, during 202 ENISA carried out the identification of leading  best practices among existing cybersecurity knowledge management  frameworks and information portals, with 81 individual knowledge  resources analysed. Based on lessons learned and the scoped leading- practice experience, inferred through surveys and interview sessions,  key potential components of the infohub’s structure have been  identified, feeding into the design of a procedural framework.  For the validation of the work and to increase acceptance, ENISA  engaged stakeholders from 13 Member States through one workshop,  three surveys and eight interviews. Moreover, NLOs and experts from  the European Cybersecurity Atlas were also engaged in this activity and  provided input and comments.  When it comes to the infohub (output 8.3), further efforts should  be pursued to better establish the ties between the infohub and  consolidated knowledge management and awareness-raising activities.  Such efforts would greatly contribute towards achieving the strategic  objective of empowered and engaged communities across the  cybersecurity ecosystem.  During 2021, ENISA consolidated and analysed the proposals and  recommendations of the four pilot projects and the European Cyber  Security Organisation, supporting the European Commission to  prepare input for future discussions on the ECCC strategic agenda.  In 2021, ENISA identified research and innovation needs and priorities  in the fields of life science, cryptography, AI and hyperconnectivity, with  the goal of preparing future funding priorities for the ECCC.  Efforts related to research and innovation under output 8.4 need to  be better streamlined to reflect the recent policy developments with  the establishment of the ECCC. In 2021, efforts on both research  and innovation priorities for the cybersecurity agenda of the EU and  support for the ECCC were bundled under one output, and corrective  actions were already taken in the 2022 SPD to split these into distinct  lines of work.

The activity also focuses on creating an international  position for ENISA in the cybersecurity ecosystem.  Overall, the concept of behavioural change towards cybersecurity requires persistent long-term  effort, well-defined objectives, an identified target group, and ultiamtely specific and relevant metrics  and indicators.  Achievements The deliverables of the team for 2021 were mostly internal, to create the stable foundation for all the awareness  activities the Agency will undertake in the coming years. Specifically, the team worked on:  •  the ENISA stakeholder strategy, a massive exercise of consolidating feedback and information from across all  ENISA units and teams, but also from external stakeholders, in a holistic inclusive framework;  •  the awareness-raising framework, a set of processes and requirements for organising an awareness-raising  campaign and programme, including all necessary steps to communicate the right messages;  •  the promotion and dissemination strategy, presenting the most effective means and channels to use for each  target audience and some advice on how to increase outreach to the community.  These documents were not published, as they are intended for internal use.  The outreach projects focusing on external stakeholders under this activity concern numerous large- and small- scale campaigns; more specifically:  •  the European Cybersecurity Month (ECSM), the flagship pan-European cybersecurity awareness campaign,  which increased its outreach;  •  the thematic campaigns on several cybersecurity topics (i.e. ransomware and certification; creating synergies;  and long-term objectives).  The multidisciplinary nature of the awareness-raising and education team helped create good and strong  collaboration points, and identified new synergies with the work of the other units.  Finally, to engage the stakeholder communities, under this activity the ad hoc working group on awareness  raising, composed of experts, was created as well as the enterprise security group focusing on SMEs. The terms  of reference for the ECSM coordinators group were drafted and approved by the group itself.  Resources Concerning resources, Activity 9 had a budget utilisation of 95 %, which is assessed as being positive given  the pandemic and the impact it had on the planning of physical events and travel expenses. In terms of FTE  resources, Activity 9 is challenged by the team’s specific nature, with colleagues coming from different units or  other teams and therefore not fully involved timewise. Even if such a team obviously presents opportunities  for synergies, it inevitably means lack of ownership of, commitment to and responsibility for the team projects.  With regard to carry-over of funds, certain outputs take place late in the year, so delivery of those projects took  place in 2022, and in other cases such as the ICC the entire project was postponed as a result of the COVID-19  pandemic. The ARET would benefit from more resources to support existing projects (heavily needed under the  OES campaigns to achieve the goal of behavioural change) but also to offload support provided by other sectors  of the Agency such as the communications sector. Approximately 30 % of the resources focused on internal  projects (including the international strategy).  ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2021 67  PART I. Achievements of the year  Overall assessment Overall, the outputs under this activity contributed into the strategic objective of empowered and engaged  communities, although at this stage it remains unclear to what extent the relevant communities are engaged  and empowered – a situation that should be clarified in the 2022 annual activity report, as the stakeholder  strategy implementation plan sets up a process to monitor and evaluate the actual engagement of stakeholder  groups under all activities in the annual activity report.  With regard to the current KPIs, they are all geared to measuring engagements during different awareness- raising campaigns, but that might not give a full picture of actual impact or added value, even if one compares  similar results in the coming years. Thus, the second KPI should be further refined to offer insights on the  effectiveness of ENISA projects at raising awareness, as the current proposal cannot derive conclusions on the  specific ENISA outputs.  A proposal for a new output under this activity is also put forward to combine all activities of the Agency that  relate to education, thus absorbing output 3.8 on the skills framework and also the task that will be created  under the cybersecurity educational roadmap.  Objectives  •  Elevate the understanding of cybersecurity risks  and practices across the EU and globally  •  Foster EU cybersecurity values and priorities  Link to strategic objective  (ENISA strategy)  •  Empowered and engaged communities across  the cybersecurity ecosystem  Results  •  Greater understanding of cybersecurity risks and practices  • Stronger European cybersecurity through higher global resilience  Outputs  9.1.  Develop an ENISA  stakeholder strategy and  undertake actions for its  implementation  Outcome  During 2021, under this output the team conducted two projects.  • The stakeholder strategy package, a set of documentation that includes  the stakeholder strategy (to be published), the implementation  guide, the management plan and the requirements for tooling. All  documents are to be used internally to support a structured approach  to stakeholder engagement and management in the Agency.  • The awareness-raising conceptual framework, the basis for future  ARET campaign development. The framework outlines the life cycle of  awareness campaigns and awareness-raising programmes, including  a detailed plan for evaluation. During the collection of project  feedback, stakeholders expressed great interest in seeing a public  version of the framework – view that is reflected in the 2022 SPD.  None of the documents is publicly available. A public version of the  ENISA stakeholder strategy will be published in 2022.  This output was replaced in the 2022 SPD with the task of seeking to  achieve behavioural change for OESs.  68  9.2.  Develop an ENISA  international strategy and  outreach activities  9.3.  Organise the ECSM  In February 2021, the ENISA task force for international cooperation  was set up and tasked with drafting the ENISA international strategy.  Based mainly on the input from the Member States, the strategy  was developed and adopted by the ENISA Management Board  in November 2021 (https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/ corporate-documents/enisa-international-strategy). The ENISA  international strategy covers cooperation with non-EU countries and  with international organisations. It sets out the principles governing  ENISA’s international cooperation, and sets out three different  approaches (limited, assisting and outreach) that the Agency can use  in terms of its level of engagement and commitment of resources.  In 2021, ENISA received several requests for international  cooperation and accommodated a number of them. For instance,  it provided assistance in the context of some cyber dialogues  with non-EU countries and contributed to international events  organised by the Council of Europe, such as the 2021 Octopus  Conference (https://www.coe.int/en/web/cybercrime/octopus-interfa ce-2021#{%22106157651%22:[10]}).  In 2021, ENISA laid the ground work international outreach activities by  formulating and publishing its first international cooperation strategy  through a cross-unit task force. In 2022, the international team (INT)  published the international strategy implementation guidelines and it is  working on creating synergies with the Agency’s operational units and  with Commission and EEAS services, and it has created a roadmap for the  Agency’s international partnerships. It will also release an annual report  on the Agency’s international cooperation as defined in the international  strategy. INT will continue to provide services to the Agency’s operational  units in 2022 and onwards, to fulfil its strategic intent.  The 9th edition of the ECSM saw great increase in outreach; for  the first time June was also included as a promotion month for the  ECSM activities, and the winning team of the ECSC announced the  ECSM’s inauguration and became ECSM ambassadors.  The campaign had two themes: Be Cyber Secure from Home (cyber  hygiene and good practices for online presence) and Cyber First  Aid (guidance when citizens are victims of cyberattacks). Twenty-six  Member States actively participated in the campaign, conducted  national campaigns and participated in the evaluation of the ECSM.  An interactive EU map was created in collaboration with the national  campaign coordinators, on which citizens can find what services are  available in their country so they may ask for advice and help should  they fall victim to a cyber incident. Ambassadors and, in general, the  concept of multipliers are fundamental to achieve greater outreach  and to overcome the language barrier and the culture gap. ECSM  activities were given a boost by having the winning ECSC team launch  the campaign, and by Member States’ efforts to approach national  celebrities to promote the campaign in their countries.  In 2021, a concept was created for measuring the impact of the  campaign and its effect on behavioural change. It will be tested and  deployed in 2022.  ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2021 69  PART I. Achievements of the year  9.4.  Organise the International  Cybersecurity Challenge  Because of the COVID-19 pandemic and the restrictions imposed by  the Greek government on events organised indoors, the ICC event  was postponed to June 2022. Despite the COVID-19 restrictions, ENISA  was able to expand the steering committee of the ICC, which now  comprises more than 100 people from 64 countries. ENISA organised  monthly meetings in which all ICC teams participated actively  throughout 2021.  The Agency also designed logos for ICC and the EU team, identified  sponsors for the event, developed a media strategy and established  the platforms that will host the ICC challenges in June 2022.  Furthermore, all the administrative issues (venue, catering and  transportation needs for teams, website, merchandise, awards for  the winning teams, invited guests) were completed in 2021, ensuring  a successful event in 2022.  ENISA was responsible for forming and training the EU team to enter  the ICC. To this end, ENISA formed a pool of 55 candidates from  21 Member States and organised two training events, which took  place in Tallinn and Turin, in which the vast majority of the EU team  candidates participated. In these events, ENISA provided training on  multiple modules (cryptography, forensics, mobile exploitation, web  exploitation, reverse engineering, attack and defence, and ethics).  It is imperative that ENISA continues its involvement in the ICC, as  ENISA has:  • successfully managed to have all seven teams travel to participate  in the 2022 ICC (more than 65 countries provide participants in  these teams);  • streamlined the 2023 ICC (it will be hosted by the Cybersecurity and  Infrastructure Security Agency in the United States, probably during  Black Hat in Las Vegas), and there are already nominations for the  2024 and 2025 ICCs (nations from Oceania and Africa);  • will continue to be responsible for handling the ICC steering  committee and guiding the rules and governance of ICC;  • will need to train and form the EU team that will take part in the  2023 ICC, commencing this activity from July 2022;  • engaged with sponsors that are interested in capacity building  globally (ISACA and Northern Ireland Co-operation Overseas (NiCo),  which has funding from the EEAS) and is assisting developing  countries in creating and participating in capture the flag’s.  The ECSM 2021 deployment report can be found online  (https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/european-cybersecurity- month-2021-deployment-report).  The ECSM continues for the 10th year in 2022. Overall, this is a highly  appreciated project, and Member States see great value in ENISA´s  coordinating actions. ENISA should further reflect on spreading activities  throughout the year, achieving a peak in October. The output should  remain as is for the 2023 SPD.  70  9.5.  Activities to promote  and ensure the uptake  of information on  good cybersecurity  practices (including on  EU strategies, security  by design and privacy by  design at EU level, and  cybersecurity certification  schemes) by different  target groups  The projects under this activity comprised thematic campaigns and the  deployment of a supporting framework (for internal use):  • publication dissemination and promotion strategy for awareness- raising providing pragmatic steps to define, address and evaluate  awareness-raising campaigns (report for internal use);  • two in-house campaigns and three campaigns in collaboration with  other EU institutions:  –  in-person awareness-raising campaign for SMEs, highlighting the  SME tool, report and booklet on best practices for SMEs, and with  the additional goal of understanding the ecosystem of SMEs and  how to reach SMEs and raise their awareness;  –  an awareness-raising campaign on certification called ‘What’s In It  for the Conformity Assessment Bodies?’ aims to empower these  key players in future EU certification through a short video and  frequently asked questions;  –  #NoMoreRansom with Europol to raise awareness of ransomware  through a dialogue led on Twitter;  –  #Women4Cyber and #CyberBecause in collaboration with  the Commission to invite women and students to choose  cybersecurity careers.  The analysis of the results of each campaign indicate that a systematic  approach and proper planning is the key. Given this, ENISA will  continue projects launched in 2021 through the coming years, focusing  each year on another target audience. For 2022, the continuation  of these campaigns is already planned, with an earlier coordination  of contributors and more resources dedicated to them.  The output should be continued, as it reflects the tasks of the CSA on  awareness and promotion of cybersecurity practices. The educational  roadmap is also included as a project under this output, which we  advise maintaining for the 2023 SPD as a separate output.

This is important, as it creates a uniform understanding of how to ensure best  performance and manage risks. It also solidifies the role of NLOs and the ENISA Advisory Group in the scoping  and validation of outputs and deliverables.  The Agency also developed and put in place a framework for evaluating the allocation of its HR and reviewing  this annually, to be able to reassign resources in an agile fashion in line with its operational priorities. This should  further strengthen the Agency’s performance management and planning.  In addition, the Agency prepared for the roll-out of a new document management system (Advanced Records  System (ARES)) by signing a service level agreement (SLA) with the Directorate-General for Informatics. The  testing and final implementation of ARES are expected to take place in 2022; this, along with the established  internal IT strategy, intellectual property rights (IPR) strategy and sensitive posts policy, helps to better mitigate  any administrative risks.  Resources The continuation of a number of projects had to be carried forward to 2022, such as the revision of the business  continuity plan and ENISA website revamp, because of internal human resource constraints, in particular legacy  aspects, duty of care and projects initiated in 2020 without clear internal support. Weaknesses in internal  controls found by the European Court of Auditors (ECA) in 2020 resulted in reassessment of staffing needs  to support this function in the course of 2021, which will be further implemented in the course of 2022.  Overall assessment The structure of Activity 10 supports the mandate of the Executive Director’s Office. The KPIs in relation to the  performance management framework needs better alignment with the staff survey to allow broader coverage  of its dimensions. In 2022 a new output was introduced to better outline the corporate communications  strategy. Since the Executive Director’s Office also supports the secretariats of several statutory bodies – namely  the Management Board, the Executive Board, the Advisory Group and the NLO Network – a separate output  could be considered to better reflect resource needs for this task.  Objectives  •  Increase effectiveness and efficiency in achieving  the agency’s objectives  •  Make the performance of ENISA fully compliant  with legal and financial frameworks (build  a culture of compliance)  •  Protect the agency’s assets and reputation, while  reducing risks  Link to corporate objective  •  Sound resource and risk management  ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2021 73  PART I. Achievements of the year  Results  •  Maximise value for money provided to stakeholders and citizens  • Build lasting credibility and trust  Outputs  10.1.  Roll out an Agency- wide performance  management framework  and systems across its  functions  Outcome  At the end of 2020, ENISA had developed a performance  management roadmap with five dimensions. In 2021 the following  initiatives were undertaken within each dimension.  • External stakeholders dimension: stakeholder strategy project begun  in 2021 and expected to be delivered in 2022 by ARET.  • People and capabilities dimension: strategic workforce review initiated  and concluded in 2021 by Corporate Support Services. As part of  this dimension under the constraints of the working regime during  the COVID-19 pandemic, emphasis was put on developing internal  communication, in particular to support remote work. Regular online  meetings with staff were organised, including introducing the ENISA  Academy to facilitate internal knowledge building.  • Organisation culture dimension: continuous information flow by the  Communications sector via weekly question and answer sessions  and intranet notifications among others.  • Internal processes dimension: evaluation of ENISA tooling needs  carried out in 2021 by Executive Director’s Office. Implementation  of the new project management tool is expected in 2022. In addition,  the preparation for ARES included the development of a filing plan  and special retention list for documents.  The outcome of the work conducted in 2021 provides a basis for improving  performance across the agency in both operational and corporate areas.  The implementation of these roadmap dimensions, namely internal  processes and costs and benefits, will continue in 2022 by complementing  an overall corporate strategy to be developed in coordination with Activity  11. The roll-out of this output should also continue in 2023 with an  assessment by the end of 2022 of whether the scope should be revisited.  10.2.  Develop, establish  and implement a risk  management plan and  systems, including an  anti-fraud strategy,  a conflict of interest  policy, a whistleblowing  policy, an information  security policy, an anti- harassment policy and  an IPR policy  The main achievements in 2021 were:  • ENISA’s anti-fraud strategy was updated and adopted (Management  Board Decision MB/2021/5); a dedicated anti-fraud website  is available on ENISA’s intranet for all staff;  • ENISA’s conflict of interest policy was updated and adopted  (Management Board Decision MB/2021/15);  • the revision of the ENISA’s IT policy and procedural framework was  kicked off, including the Agency’s information security policy;  • the ENISA’s IPR policy was developed, adopted and published online  (https://www.enisa.europa.eu/about-enisa/legal-notice/enisa-ipr- policy-public-version);  74  • several specific risk assessments were conducted in different areas  with a view to establishing lessons learned and recommendations  for the future (e.g. in the areas of recruitment, IT security and  incident management).  In 2021 the agency handled complaints to the European Ombudsman,  reports and recommendations of the European Anti-Fraud Office, the  ECA and the Internal Audit Service (IAS) as well as the legal aspects  related to the implementation of ENISA’s seat agreement with the host  country, in accordance with the overview provided under the KPIs.  The Data Protection Officer provided advice on several operational and  administrative matters, maintained the ENISA’s register of processing  activities, cooperated with the EDPS and contributed to the activities  of the EUIs Data Protection Officers network (co-chair of Data  Protection Officers–ICT Advisory Committee of the EU Agencies  and Institutions Working Group).  ENISA has a full-time Information Security Officer, appointed since  2019, who coordinates its information security management system.  ENISA’s Information Security Officer contributed to several related activities  in 2021, such as the ENISA annual security risk assessment exercise,  regular vulnerability assessments and penetrations tests of ENISA systems,  network security monitoring and incident response, advising on internal  security policies, etc. The Information Security Officer works in close  cooperation with the CERT-EU on the aforementioned matters.  Overall, the output in 2022 continues to maintain compliance aspects.  Some work planned in 2021 was not completed, namely updating the  whistleblowing policy and implementing the risk management plan  and systems. In 2021 the main focus was on lessons learned, with  a view to establishing a comprehensive risk assessment methodology  for ENISA in the course of 2022. Output is adjusted in the 2022  work programme and should be continued in line with the results  of ENISA’s risk assessment, and the risk appetite and risk-mitigating  measures defined by the ENISA Management Team in 2022.  10.3.  Develop and implement  an agency-wide IT  strategy  10.4.  Carry out relevant  training and develop  guidelines for staff  An agency-wide IT strategy was developed and adopted.  The output will continue in 2022 with an emphasis on developing and  updating several IT-related policies in close coordination with Activity 11,  aiming to introduce the ISO 27001 standard at ENISA by the end of 2024.  • Four internal courses on data protection (general data protection,  procurement and cloud services, events, data protection by design)  were held.  • Information security awareness training (via an external platform)  took place.  • There was an information session on ENISA’s IPR policy.  • Assistants trained ENISA newcomers in the use of internal tools and  its financial cycle.  • Guidance was issued to staff on several implementation provisions  of the Seat agreement with the Hellenic Republic.  ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2021 75  PART I. Achievements of the year  The output in 2021 focused on compliance and this will continue in 2022  with an emphasis on guidance for staff on ethics, conduct, tools and  processes introduced as part of outputs 10.1 and 10.2.

Newly appointed middle managers were asked  to assist in bringing about meaningful outcomes as a result of the reorganisation. The new way of working  and operating under a matrix set-up brought out a lot of knowledge-sharing opportunities and steered  the agency resources towards a first step of more flexible ways of operating.  Staff motivation was a priority, and ENISA continues to strive to keep staff highly engaged. However, nearly one  quarter of ENISA staff find that they have limited opportunities to grow within the Agency, and are not satisfied  with their work. This is a clear indicator that the Agency needs to further address staff development, and  enhance job satisfaction. The matrix set-up also allowed staff to unfold talents and use them to achieve quality  outcomes across all areas of agency activity; however, the Agency needs to work more concretely towards this  goal, revamp its learning and development policy and move towards business-driven learning needs. The Agency  conducted its annual staff survey, in which staff had the opportunity to express their views, and for the Agency  to carry out follow-up actions. The Agency took measures to address complaints and continues to establish open  communication channels with staff, both directly and through representatives on the staff committee.  As the Agency shifted to a combined qualitative as well as quantitative approach to management, new  management instruments were introduced to monitor performance on quarterly, four-monthly and annual  bases, providing a dense framework of performance and continuous improvement. The reclassification exercise  was improved in order to steer the process towards qualitative elements of assessment and focus on outputs  and behaviours that are widely observed and recognised, as means to promote best practices.  Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic and during 2021, the agency has introduced and maintained permanent  teleworking options while maintaining and enhancing employee motivation, efficiency and development.  Such measures enhanced the Agency’s flexibility and drive to manage its people and services using modern  HR practices. Such measures also helped the Agency recognise the importance of staff flexibility in the modern  working environment while shifting process improvement to remote management practices.  During 2021 ENISA focused on attracting, retaining and developing talent, and building ENISA’s reputation  as an employer of choice and an agile and knowledge-based organisation where staff can develop personally  and professionally, while keeping staff engaged and motivated and providing a sense of belonging.  Action has been taken to build an attractive workspace by establishing and maintaining excellent working  conditions (premises, layout of office space). The move of ENISA to its new office location, the refurbishment  and the improvement of the office space were steps towards improved working conditions. Such improvements  occurred while developing user-centric (tele)working functionalities. The existing infrastructure for secure remote  connections enabled the Agency to switch to teleworking seamlessly when the building became unavailable  because of the lockdowns triggered by the pandemic. However, the Agency is facing significant challenges in its  audiovisual and videoconferencing capabilities, which need to be further upgraded and steered towards more  state-of-the-art services in order to help the Agency meet its operational objectives. Moreover, the Agency needs  to further review its IT policies, practices and monitoring to improve the service delivery it offers to its users.  However, the IT tools the unit uses do not support a modern, sustainable and flexible working environment, and  they require significant investment in order to move towards simpler but user-centric tools.  ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2021 77  PART I. Achievements of the year  Resources In terms of resourcing, the unit faced resource constraints on implementing its activity programme due to the  increased administrative procedures and the move to the new premises. To perform its objectives, the Agency  relied heavily on delivering its services through interim agents who supported the day-to-day administrative  burden in the support functions. Considering that increased support was also needed following the  reorganisation, 10 additional interim agents were allocated to cover ongoing needs. The preparation for the new  building also put an additional strain on the financial and procurement team, which had to administer additional  financial processes to implement the move in compliance with approved standards.  While tasks were assigned based on the physical location of the Agency (Athens, Brussels, Heraklion), this old  way of managing resources did not support a more flexible way of operating and as a result increased the daily  operational complexity and staffing needs. A particular constraint that was established was in the area of facility  management, where the scope and breadth of activities was greater; however, the Agency had allocated 1 FTE  located in Heraklion to managing the facilities at all locations, or requirements were addressed ad hoc. Some  of the facility management activities had been undertaken by the retiring security officer, which resulted in an  operational gap for the unit.  As a result, a lot of activities in facility management were not tackled. In addition, the introduction of the  Information Technology Management Committee (ITMC) and Budget Management Committee (BMC), while the  Agency moved to more centralised IT governance, created a new way of operating for the Corporate Support  Services Unit, which brought about further delays in project implementation. At the end of the year, to address  the Agency’s operational needs for meetings, a refurbishment plan was proposed and endorsed to reconstruct  part of the conference area and part of some office space. The refurbishment also included the redesign of the  boardroom. For this reason, a carry-over (EUR 643 407) was planned in order to cater for this project.  Regarding the unit’s knowledge, additional investment needs to be made in educating the unit further and  bringing its human capital up to date with the latest practices by means of traditional conventional training  and on-the-job learning and job-sharing activities. This would establish a solid basis for further enhancing the  operational capability of the team to meet its objectives. Considering that the Agency operates on project-based  methodologies and has reorganised its operation, the unit struggles to keep up with the new way of working  as incoming requests come from all users. Also considering that this was the first year it operated following the  reorganisation and the arrival of a new head of CSS, the unit has started to build up its knowledge levels slowly  but steadily. While peer-learning continues, the professionalisation of the CSS services must go hand in hand  with service optimisation while at the same time building up the knowledge level of its staff. Besides that, one  of the challenges the unit faces is the grading of its staff in relation to the activities, and responsibilities fulfilled.  While the unit will engage in a service delivery roadmap transition, the job responsibilities and grading will be  reviewed in order to reflect the exact level of responsibilities performed.  Overall assessment Overall, it is evident that the relevance of the structure of the activity, its outputs and its KPIs need to be reviewed  in order to reflect the full-service provision the unit offers. During the implementation, it was evident that not all  service outputs were identified under Activity 11, while there were overlaps with Activity 10 on many occasions,  as both units share a compliance, coordinating, project and policy-driven angle but tackle it from different  perspectives. Therefore, activities 10 and 11 need to be revised in the 2023 SPD to more closely reflect the work  carried out.  Based on the existing output description in the SPD, it has proven challenging to link various initiatives of the CSS  unit to the output descriptions of this activity and to cater for the main elements of service provision, which are  recurrent services. This has created a lot of challenges in the implementation capabilities as well as the reporting  capabilities of the unit. Overall, the recurrent service provision, service optimisation and security-related outputs  should be further reflected in the 2023 SPD while redrafting the existing outputs in a way that supports more  flexible implementation of activities in order to assist the Agency to meet its corporate objectives. Considering  the 2021 results, in 2022, CSS went for a back-to-basics action plan (review of rules, tools, map as-is format, etc.)  in which the building blocks are being set up to cater for the challenges of the future. This initiative will need to  continue in 2023 onwards while building upon the strategic and service delivery model.  78  Objectives  •  Engaged staff who are committed and motivated  to deliver and who are empowered to fully use  their talents, skills and competences  •  Digitally enabled workplace and environment  (including home workspace) that cultivates and  nourishes performance, and enhances social and  environmental responsibility  Link to corporate objective  •  Build an agile organisation focused on people  Results  •  ENISA as an employer of choice  Outputs  11.1.  Implementation of the  competence framework  (including the training  strategy, CDR report,  internal competitions,  exit interviews)  Outcome  In 2021, the HR sector embarked upon a continuation of the  development of the competency framework. It wished to  operationalise the competency framework in different processes  of the talent management life cycle, namely recruitment, performance  management and appraisals, reclassification and contract renewal,  and learning and development. The challenges faced in the matter  were related to the differentiation of competency expectations (i.e.  competencies and proficiency levels), between different roles and  grades in the organisation, as well as internal consistency in the use  of competency expectations (i.e. competencies and proficiency levels).  It was also deemed crucial to have overall clarity and transparency  for staff, and related principles such as objectivity, transparency  and fairness.  HR worked on addressing challenges related to the construction  of the competency framework, potentially necessary changes  and adaptations, and a conceptual approach on how to use the  competency framework in HR processes. This was closely related  to having staff members who are highly motivated and loyal to the  organisation and whose competencies are used in the right place,  at the right time.  In practice, the newly established competency framework is proving  to be quite challenging to implement, so a further simplification review  is envisaged in the course of 2022–2023. The Agency plans a revision  of the framework to simplify it with the possible aim of tying it to  a revision of its job-mapping and -grading structure for future strategic  workforce-planning activities.  Having regard to the need to reorganise the services of the unit, and work on the synergies identified among the  various sectors, the Agency suggests that the Management Board adjust the outputs of this activity and redefine  them in a way that supports the Agency’s transformation in order to meet its strategic objectives. It is also further  envisaged that Activities 10 and 11 be redefined to better synergise the complementarity of the two units.  ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2021 79  PART I. Achievements of the year  HR examined the feedback from the exit interviews and staff  surveys to identify those points that need to be addressed in order  to continue improving its services. Feedback received was mainly  directed at the cumbersome administrative processes, lack of  internal communication or unclarity about where the information  may be found easily, and sometimes at organisational complexity  or complacency that prevents innovative ideas and practices from  contributing more to the strategic objectives.  Regarding recruitment and onboarding, a lot of emphasis was given to  sourcing good candidates with diverse backgrounds; however, budget  restrictions prohibited the use of a wide range of sourcing options. The  administrative process behind the recruitment procedures was lengthy  and cumbersome, which led to operational delays. Emphasis needs  to be put on simplifying the recruitment procedures, educating ENISA  staff and obtaining a tool to speed up ENISA’s response to sourcing  talents that would help the Agency fulfil its strategic needs.  The results of the KPIs associated with this output indicate a first  good step towards the activity outputs; however, there is a lot of work  that the Agency needs to do to further establish the pillars for talent  development and increased job satisfaction. The parameters can move  outside the barriers of HR and also encompass working conditions,  digitalisation of services, self-service functionalities, simplification  of procedures, etc.  Given the outcomes of 2021, the added value achieved and the related  actions already planned in the 2022 SPD, the output description was  very restrictive and limited the possibilities and breadth of actions  the unit could engage in. The Agency needs to move towards more  forward-looking practices and adopt an overall corporate strategy  that addresses its HR, IT, security, facility management and financial  challenges. Therefore, a more holistic revision of this objective is  needed, in close partnership with the Executive Director’s Office,  to address the corporate objective and the challenges of the future.  Therefore, the Agency suggests that the Management Board adjust the  outputs for the 2023 SPD and redefine them in a broader context that  would better fit the corporate objective.  11.2.  Actions to develop and  nourish talent (in line  with output 11.1)  During Q4 2021, HR deep-dived into performance management and  revamped the current framework, within the limits of the applicable  Management Board rules adopted in 2015. Nourishing performance  and career progress is a top priority for the HR sector, which is why  there were numerous and extensive training courses organised for  staff and management, as well as several seminars dedicated to the  performance management framework. The appraisal exercise is under  way, and the lessons learned from the new approach will be evaluated  in the course of 2022.  In response to the pandemic and the need to have a digitally enabled  workplace and environment, in Q1 2021 the agency extended its  welfare scheme by adopting a decision on the reimbursement of  Internet expenses since March 2020 retroactively. Within the context  of a broader welfare package, the Agency continues to pay attention  to the benefits it offers to its staff in order to balance out the reduced  coefficient rate and legal limitations regarding flexible work practices.  80  The Agency also ensured that ergonomic equipment such as chairs,  monitors and peripherals were distributed to staff, to ensure that their  home environments were sufficiently equipped for them to continue  to perform their duties.  In terms of nourishing talent, besides the broad learning offer that  is available to staff, the Agency offers on-the-job development  opportunities through its annual call for contributions in its teams.  This is a way to enhance talent, work on fields outside one’s own,  bridge the gap between operational and support units, and give  opportunities for new ideas and new contributors to combine  knowledge sharing with additional outputs. It is unfortunate that not  many candidates from support units contributed to the team outputs,  which is an indicator the Agency needs to consider thoroughly.  Besides that, the Agency needs to further develop the 70–20–10  model for learning and development in the course of its upcoming  SPD to capitalise on its staff strengths and competencies and promote  a collaborative, open culture of learning. To do so, the Agency needs  to steer its budget not only towards training activities that would  enhance the technical aspects of the training, which need to be more  closely focused on its strategic objectives, but also towards investing  in educating staff. Additional budget would need to be provided  following the review of the Agency’s L&D policy and framework.  The Agency needs to further explore and reassess its corporate  strategy and consequent HR strategy in order to identify ways of  improving ENISA and attracting talents in the competitive cyberfield  world. While doing so, the Agency needs to shift its talents towards  a more flexible and agile workforce so resources are allocated to  business priorities. Therefore, the Agency needs to build on its  current base and adopt an efficiency gains strategy addressing all  levels by revising its HR, finance and corporate services practices.  By doing so, the Agency needs to further elaborate and align its  strategic workforce-planning practices, data analytics and workload  indicators while reviewing and simplifying its current administrative  procedures by improving its tools or revising its existing practices.  Additional revision of ENISA’s financial model is required in order to  enhance accountability across all layers of the Agency while reducing  administrative procedures. The introduction of Mission Integrated  processing system and the Public Procurement Management Tool in  2022 and 2023 would be a first step towards this model revision.  The results of the KPIs associated with this output indicate a first  good step towards the activity outputs; however, there is a lot of work  that the Agency needs to do to further establish the pillars for talent  development and increased job satisfaction. The parameters can move  outside the barriers of HR and also encompass working conditions,  digitalisation of services, self-service functionalities, simplification of  procedures, etc. Significant work needs to be done on revisiting the  job descriptions and moving towards job profiling and competency  development, while focusing on learning activities that add value  to the business objectives and support professional advancement,  establishing multiple career path options.  Given the outcomes of 2021, the added value achieved and the related  actions already planned in the 2022 SPD, the output was partly achieved,  as it was focused only on the HR component in isolation. In line with the  revised CSS way forward, the agency suggests that the Management  Board redefine this output and increase its scope in the 2023 SPD.  ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2021 81  PART I. Achievements of the year  11.3.  Undertake actions to  support a digital working  environment and  develop necessary tools  and services in line with  output 10.3  While continuing with a burdensome administrative way of working,  in 2021 the Agency enhanced the structure of its digital working  environment, by improving its collaboration platforms by moving to  SharePoint 2019 on its premises, and by migrating ENISA’s repository  structure to an updated environment. ENISA also built up its  conferencing capacity by renewing Webex online conferencing and  activating end-to-end encryption, and set up a boardroom facility  in the new headquarters in Athens as the basis of an updated  videoconferencing infrastructure.  ENISA also reinforced the ability of staff and contractors to telework by  promoting a replacement teleworking solution for the current system,  which is reaching the end of support (Microsoft Direct Access), and  moving towards a new teleworking solution (FortiVPN), which started  as a successful pilot in 2021 and aspires to be functional in Q3 2022.  Finally, the Agency undertook an assessment of its tooling needs under  Activity 10 (see main achievements under Activity 10).  In terms of digital simplifications, the Agency undertook a series of  initiatives and continued its transition from paper-based to self-service  functionalities by preparing further HR modules in Sysper and ARES.  In 2021, the Agency also conducted an analysis conducted internal  testing on introducing Mission Integrated processing system and the  Public Procurement Management Tool for its mission and procurement  procedures. The pilot phases were successful and the Agency is now  preparing the transition to the full Agency in 2022. However, it has to  be noted that introducing all these systems came in addition to the  work performed by staff, without additional resources being provided.  In 2021, with the arrival of the new head of CSS, the Agency will look  further into the service provision of its services and move towards  a service-based model. A further analysis needs to be made in 2022  in order to identify and map which services it will keep in house and  those it will outsource. To do so, the Agency will need additional  budget to cater for the new modus operandi and look in more detail  at its outputs and workload indicators, so that it can reshuffle priorities  according to its business needs. To further support the efficiency  gain strategy and the business model transformation, additional  budget is needed to support the units in outsourcing services to  external providers.  The results of the KPIs associated with this output indicate a first good  step towards the activity’s outputs; however, these were primarily  IT driven, and other components are needed to contribute towards  an improved digital working environment. The Agency needs to further  redefine its IT service provision model and service optimisation in order  to cater for the challenges of the future, while including in its scope  activities beyond IT that contribute to this goal.  Given the outcomes of 2021, the added value achieved and the  related actions already planned in the 2022 SPD, the output was partly  achieved, as the concrete outputs under this activity and the KPIs  reflected the former set-up of the CSS unit. In line with the revised CSS  way forward, the Agency will suggest to the Management Board to  redefine this activity and increase its scope in the 2023 SPD.  82  11.4.  Planning, preparation  and completion of the  establishment of the  Agency’s headquarters in  its new premises in line  with the objectives of the  activity  During 2021, the Agency planned, prepared and moved to its  new headquarters building, ensuring minimal disruption to its  operations. An internal team supported the move throughout the  process and coordinated with internal and external stakeholders,  including the creation of a detailed plan for all phases of the  successful implementation.  Throughout the year, all ENISA staff and managers were involved in  exploring the best use of the new facilities and how the future work of  the Agency should be conducted to strengthen the Agency’s creativity,  collaboration, values and mandate. The building is now operational;  however, additional work is required in order to improve the existing  facilities, improve its audiovisual services, and cater for more open and  collaborative work practices. The Agency also needs to reflect more  holistically on its hot-desking and office-sharing policy, so that its facilities  practices contribute practically to an open and collaborative yet agile  way of working. The new building also brings a lot of daily challenges  in facility management, and the Agency has decided to outsource the  facility management service in order to alleviate pressure on resources  while maintaining a fully functioning building. Thus, additional funds are  needed in order to ensure that the Agency fulfils its strategic objectives.  The Agency also proceeded further in preparing to open a Brussels  office, which will help keep operational activities secure and assist the  Agency in fulfilling its operational mandate.  Given the outcomes of 2021, the added value achieved and the related  actions already planned in the 2022 SPD, the output description was  met. The Agency needs to move towards more forward-looking practices  and adopt an overall corporate strategy that addresses its HR, IT,  security, facility management and financial challenges. Therefore, the  Agency suggests that the Management Board adjust the output for the  2023 SPD and redefine it in a broader context.

ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2021 85  PART I. Achievements of the year  II  ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2021 87  1 MANAGEMENT BOARD  In 2021 the Management Board met for two  ordinary meetings.  In total, the Management Board made 19 decisions  during the year, such as on the anti-fraud strategy  and its action plan, on the setting up of a local office  in Brussels and on EU classified information.  As part of its functions, the Management Board  adopted its analysis and assessment of the 2020  annual activity report, in which it commended  the Agency on the very high standard achieved in  the delivery of its work. The Management Board  also expressed its favourable opinion on the final  annual accounts for 2020 and adopted the ENISA  programming document 2022–2024, including the  2022 budget and the 2022 establishment plan.  Sharing information with the Management Board  regularly, ENISA reported on the work programme  and budget implementation, and gave updates  on the reorganisation and the relocation of the  ENISA headquarters in Athens, among other  pertinent matters.  In addition, the Management Board provided  guidance on the ENISA stakeholder strategy.  The Executive Board had one formal meeting  per quarter.  2 MAJOR DEVELOPMENTS  The 2021 work programme was developed to  enable the Agency to fully exploit its permanent  mandate and fulfil all the tasks given to it by the CSA,  while taking into account all other changes in the  EU’s regulatory framework. In addition, the 2021 work  programme was aligned with ENISA’s new strategy,  which was adopted by the Management Board in  June 2020 and was used as a baseline to set the  strategic objectives and priorities for planning the  Agency’s work using a multi-annual framework.  Reorganisation  The 2021 programming document was drawn up in  parallel with the reorganisation of the Agency, which  was agreed by the Management Board in June 2020  and became effective on 1 January 2021. The new  organisational structure is aligned with the tasks and  functions of the Agency’s structural set-up under  the CSA, thus allowing more efficient delivery of  the activities in the work programme. A framework  was established for the organisation of the work of  all staff members of the Agency. The Management  Team assists the Executive Director in his functions,  ensuring that activities undertaken by the agency  under its work programme add value for the Union  and are planned and implemented in a coordinated  fashion. Its role is to enhance cooperation and to  build synergies across the organisation through an  PART II (A) MANAGEMENT  8888  open exchange of views and shared information.  The following units were established to ensure the  performance of the tasks of the agency as set out  in the CSA:  Policy Development and Implementation Unit  to implement Article 5 of the CSA;  Capacity Building Unit to implement Article 6 and  Article 7(5) of the CSA;  Operational Cooperation Unit to implement  Article 7 (except for Article 7(5)) of the CSA;  Market, Certification and Standardisation Unit to  implement Articles 8 and 22 and Title III of the CSA.  The following four teams were established and tasked  with articles of the CSA:  Knowledge and Information Team to implement  Article 9;  Awareness Raising and Education Team  to implement Article 10;  Research and Innovation Team to implement  Article 11;  International Cooperation Team to implement  Articles 12 and 42.  In addition, two corporate units were established  to support the Executive Director:  the Executive Director’s Office ensures that the  Agency has in place an operational performance  management framework, anti-fraud policies, and  an internal evaluation and control framework so  that the agency follows the objectives of sound  budgetary management and complies with its  legal obligations (including conflict of interest  rules and ethical standards);  the Corporate Support Service ensures that  the Agency has modern capabilities and tools  to manage and develop its HR, in particular  talent management programmes (learning and  development), a workforce recruitment and  retention strategy, and adequate employee  services (including individual rights and salaries).  Establishment of IT Management  Committee and Budget Management  Committee  The ITMC was established in the first quarter of  2021, to ensure the comprehensive and coordinated  management of the Agency’s IT systems and services  required to fulfil its core tasks, as described by its  operational mandate, and corporate functions.  The mandate of the ITMC encompasses the entire  life cycle of all relevant IT projects, including setting  the overall framework and guiding the development,  roll-out and implementation as well as follow-up  and analysis.  The BMC was established in the last quarter of 2020.  The mandate of the BMC is to ensure coherent  planning, implementation and follow-up of the  Agency’s budget, and encompasses the entire life  cycle of the budget, including assisting in setting the  overall framework and guiding the development,  roll-out and implementation as well as follow-up and  analysis of the budget. Therefore, the BMC issued  budget implementation reports and submitted them  to the Management Team, reflecting the status of  implementation of the budget as of 1 May 2021 and  1 September 2021, and targeted interim reports  every quarter to tackle specific issues arising from the  implementation of the budget.  Structured cooperation with the  Computer Emergency Response Team  for the EU Institutions, Bodies and  Agencies  The reporting year also marked the point when  structured cooperation between ENISA and CERT-EU  in the field of operational cooperation became fully  operational with the annual cooperation plan and the  MoU between ENISA and CERT-EU.  New headquarters in Athens  In agreement with the Greek authorities, ENISA moved  into its new headquarters in Athens in 2021 to meet  the growing needs of the Agency.  The Agency moved into the new headquarters  building in the third quarter of 2021, ensuring minimal  disruption to operations. An internal workgroup  supported the move throughout the process and  coordinated with internal and external stakeholders,  including the creation of a detailed plan for all phases  of successful implementation.  Throughout the year, all ENISA staff and managers  were involved in exploring the best use of the new  facilities and how the future work of the Agency should  be conducted to strengthen the Agency’s creativity,  collaboration and corporate values. In response to the  COVID-19 pandemic, new consideration was given to  hybrid ways of working that will affect how the Agency  best uses its resources. During this discussion, the  environmental impacts of the Agency’s operations  ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2021 89  PART II. Management  and performance were considered in the light of the  desired environmental management strategy that  was developed.  Brussels local office  The ENISA local office in Brussels was established  with a view to implementing structured cooperation  with CERT-EU and maintaining regular and systematic  cooperation with EUIBAs including but not limited to  CERT-EU, the EEAS, Europol, the EDA and/or other  competent bodies involved in cybersecurity, in order  to benefit from synergies and avoid the duplication  of activities.  Recruitment  In 2020 the Agency embarked on a large-scale novel  recruitment exercise to create a sufficiently diverse and  broad reserve shortlist of 75 candidates with broader  competences and skills that could be used to recruit  staff and thus fill the gaps in the current establishment  plan, as well as serving as a pool of candidates for  the future establishment plan. Through the success  of this call, ENISA welcomed 31 newcomers in 2021  (22 temporary agents, 5 contract agents, 3 seconded  national experts and 1 trainee), an increase in staff  members of over 25 %. ENISA’s workforce planning has  allowed the Agency to proactively estimate, engage,  develop and align its HR with the evolving strategic  focus of its activities and objectives as directed by its  SPDs, the Management Board and Union legislation.  3 BUDGETARY AND FINANCIAL  MANAGEMENT  a) FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT  The Agency operated with a budget of  EUR 23.5 million, equivalent to an 8 % increase  in 2021 compared with the 2020 budget  (EUR 21.7 million). An amending budget was adopted  by the Management Board by written procedure  on 21 December 2021, reflecting new challenges  and priorities stemming from the move to the new  office building in Athens and the COVID-19 pandemic.  Amending budget 1/2021 was adopted in order  to finance new projects and activities amounting  to EUR 0.5 million, mostly related to refurbishment  needs for the new office.  In 2021 ENISA concluded a total of 58 public  procurement procedures (two of which were  undertaken jointly with the European Centre for  the Development of Vocational Training (Cedefop)):  31 were done through reopening of competitions  under framework contracts (53 %);  15 were done through negotiated procedures  for middle- and low-value contracts (26 %);  8 were done using the open procedure (14 %);  3 were done using the restricted procedure (5 %);  1 was done using the CEI procedure (2 %).  EUR 3.02 was paid in 2021 to suppliers as interest  for late payments.  The table below shows ENISA’s budget  implementation targets and achievements  in 2021, which remained high under the  restrictive circumstances imposed by COVID-19.  Area Objective Target 2021 Level of completion 2021  Budget implementation (appropriations  committed through the year)  Efficiency and sound  financial management 99 % 99.51 %  Payments against appropriations of the  year (C1 funds)  Efficiency and sound  financial management 85 % 77.40 %  Payments against appropriations carried  over from previous year (C8 funds)  Efficiency and sound  financial management 95 % 96.55 %  In agreement with  the Greek authorities,  ENISA moved into its  new headquarters in  Athens in 2021 to meet  the growing needs of  the Agency.  9090  b) BUDGET EXECUTION OF EU SUBSIDY (C1 FUNDS  OF CURRENT YEAR 2021)  During 2021, ENISA committed EUR 22 721 149,  representing 99.51 % of the total budget for the  year. Payments made during the year amounted to  EUR 17 672 344, representing 77.40 % of the total  budget. The budgetary execution was high despite  the restrictive circumstances imposed by COVID-19.  Compared with 2020, there was a noticeable  increase in commitment execution – 99.51 % in 2021  compared with 97.35 % in 2020 – and a noticeable  increase in payment execution – 77.40 % compared  with 68.62 % in 2020. The target of 95 % for  commitment rate set by the Commission (Directorate- General for Budget) was reached. The commitment  appropriations corresponding to the EU subsidy (C1  appropriations) that were not paid at the end of 2021  were carried forward to 2022.  c) AMENDING BUDGET / BUDGETARY TRANSFERS  According to Article 26 of ENISA’s applicable  financial rules, the Executive Director may transfer  appropriations from one title to another up to  a maximum of 10 % of the appropriations for the  financial year shown on the line from which the transfer  is made. Transfers within the same title are permitted  without limit. Beyond the limit referred to above, the  Executive Director may propose to the Management  Board transfers of appropriations from one title to  another. The Management Board has two weeks to  oppose the proposed transfers. After that time limit,  the proposed transfers are deemed to be adopted.  The Agency made four transfers in the reporting  year by the decision of the Executive Director on  the initial budget, and one transfer by the decision  of the Executive Director on the amended budget  (in comparison, the Executive Director made three  transfers on the initial budget and four transfers on  the amended budget in 2020). The four transfers on  the initial budget included one transfer within title  and three transfers between titles and within title.  The only transfer on the amended budget was both  within title and between titles. Because of COVID-19  restrictions and of the move to the new building,  funds were mainly redirected from salaries, meetings,  conferences, other events and business travel to  support mostly refurbishment-related needs for the  new office, and staff development and learning needs.  The table below summarises the execution of the budget in 2021 by title.  2021 budget (C1)  Area of  budget  allocation  Appropriation  amount (EUR)  (1)  Commitment  amount (EUR)  (2)  Percentage  committed  (2)/(1)  Payment  amount  (EUR) (3)  Percentage  paid  (3)/(1)  Amount carried  forward to 2022  (EUR)  Title I 10 707 109 10 701 572 99.95 9 993 015 93.33 708 558  Title II (*) 3 662 751 3 636 207 99.28 1 472 134 40.19 2 164 073  Title III 8 463 200 8 383 370 99.06 6 207 195 73.34 2 176 174  TOTAL 22 833 060 22 721 149 99.51 17 672 344 77.40 5 048 805  (*) Title II does not include the subsidy of up to EUR 640 000 from the Greek authorities for the rent of the building.

ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2021 91  PART II. Management  d)  CARRY-FORWARD OF COMMITMENT  APPROPRIATIONS  The commitment appropriations corresponding to  the EU subsidy (C1 appropriations) that were not fully  paid at the end of 2020 were carried forward to 2021  (C8 appropriations).  Compared with 2020, there was a nearly  1 percentage point increase in payment execution  (96.55 % in 2021 compared with 95.86 % in 2020),  showing an improvement in financial management in  this regard.  4 DELEGATION AND SUB DELEGATION  At the end of 2020, in line with the reorganisation,  the Executive Director reviewed the delegation of  authorising authority powers and on 22 December  2020 adopted a new decision on a framework of the  financial delegation of the authorising officer.  This decision confirmed the financial delegations  applicable to heads of unit and permanent team  leaders with respective limits of EUR 400 000  and EUR 200 000 per transaction. ENISA did not  implement any further subdelegations in 2021.  Controls on these delegation rights are done through  a periodical revision of the rights granted in the main  financial system Accrual Based Accounting (ABAC) and  are shared on an annual basis with the Commission  (Directorate-General for Budget).  5 HUMAN RESOURCES MANAGEMENT  In 2020 the ENISA Management Board established  a structure for the Agency, set in place principles  under which the organisation should function, and  imposed guidelines for the proportional allocation  of resources between its operational units and  those that support the administrative and corporate  functions. On 1 January 2021, the new organisational  structure was in effect.  The HR sector continued to support the operational  and administrative goals of the Agency in terms of  staff acquisition and development. In 2021, ENISA  HR welcomed 31 newcomers (22 temporary agents,  5 contract agents, 3 seconded national experts and  1 trainee). ENISA’s workforce planning was for the  first time mapped by an Executive Director decision  (17/2021). The aim of this decision was to set the  basis for strategic workforce planning, which would  allow the Agency to proactively estimate, engage,  develop and align its HR with the evolving strategic  focus of its activities and objectives as directed by its  SPDs, the Management Board and Union legislation.  Following this decision, the Executive Director  promptly launched the 2021 strategic workforce  review by Decision No 28/2021.  In 2021, ENISA carried out tasks to support the  deployment of the Commission’s information  management system for HR, Sysper.  In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, in 2021  ENISA staff continued to telework. Staff guidelines  were drawn up and teleworking was authorised in  lieu of working in the office for all staff. The Agency  continued to exercise its duty of care and allow staff  members to take precautions based on numbers  of intensive care units available in each relevant  Member State. During the pandemic, daily updates  were sent to all staff members via a designated  functional mailbox, detailing the number of cases  and the most recent developments in the world,  so as to keep staff abreast of the latest news.  The following table shows the commitment execution and payment execution in 2021.  2021 budget (C8)  2021 area of budget  allocation  Appropriations carried forward  from 2020 to 2021 (EUR)  PAYMENT  AMOUNT (EUR)  Percentage  paid  Amount cancelled  (EUR)  Title I 1 209 759 1 135 981 93.90 73 779  Title II 1 762 732 1 672 080 94.86 90 651  Title III 3 102 500 3 057 545 98.55 44 955  TOTAL 6 074 991 5 865 606 96.55 209 385  9292  Compliance remained a priority for the HR unit  both in terms of meeting audit and internal control  recommendations and in terms of meeting statutory  requirements such as in the area of personal  data protection.  Implementing rules adopted  In 2021, ENISA adopted two European Commission  decisions: on a procedure for dealing with  professional incompetence, and on laying down  general implementing provisions on the conduct of  administrative inquiries and disciplinary proceedings.  Brief description of the results of the  screening/benchmarking exercise  ENISA continued in 2021 to partially apply the  benchmarking exercise following the European  Commission’s methodology. The third table in  Annex IV depicts the results of the exercise based  on the type of posts with regard to administrative  support and coordination, operational and neutral.  A slight increase can be observed in the type of posts  under ‘administrative support and coordination’ and  ‘neutral’ in comparison with 20203. The Management  Board set out a transition period for the Agency  within the 2022–2024 SPD based on the requirements  outlined in Article 3(3) of Management Board Decision  MB/2020/9, which direct the Executive Director  to take steps in order to ensure that the average  number of staff members assigned to the Executive  Director’s Office and the CSS does not exceed  the average number of staff member assigned to  operational units.  3 While the percentages in 2021 show a 'decrease' in the  operational figures, in reality the % of the operational  staff have increased not decreased, compared to 2019- 2020. The numbers reported under the old structure did  not reflect mandates of structural units accurately. The  numbers reported under the 2021 exercise did not take  fully into consideration the qualitative elements of the  Commission’s methodology which indicates, among others,  that structural entity takes precedence over the function of  the post (e.g. administrative function supporting operational  units are counted as operational roles as they provide  support of an operational nature), that the exact job purpose  of the post needs to be looked at when in doubt (e.g. HR  payroll is considered neutral and not administrative support  even though the role belongs in HR, while internal control  with emphasis on process is administrative support and not  neutral) or the reference to the legal act needs to be looked at  (how the job role fits under the Cybersecurity Act). The Agency  intends to rectify this exercise in 2022 by fully aligning with  the Commission methodology.  6 STRATEGY FOR GAINS IN EFFICIENCY  In 2021, the agency focused on implementing  internal gains in efficiency in various areas as per  the performance management roadmap.  Over the recording year, the reorganisation led to  a complete revision of its way of working for internal  decision-making. The Agency progressively optimised  its structure and working methods, and implemented  cost efficiency measures in its business model, for  example by introducing the Commission tools Sysper,  Mission Integrated processing system and ARES.  This led to an improvement in performance in various  areas but also to a strengthening of service continuity.  Furthermore, the implementation of several MoUs  and SLAs signed in 2020 and early 2021 led to close  cooperation with other EUIBAs, namely Cedefop,  eu-LISA, CERT-EU, the EDA and Europol. SLAs with  Commission services allow the Agency to optimise  its resources spent on administrative support. HR,  treasury services and the cybersecurity of ENISA’s IT  systems are supported through such SLAs.  In 2022 the Agency is actively seeking gains in efficiency  by developing an approach to sharing services with the  newly established European Cybersecurity Industrial,  Technology and Research Competence Centre4, in  particular in the area of administrative support.  7 ASSESSMENT OF AUDIT AND EX-POST  EVALUATION RESULTS DURING THE  REPORTING YEAR  7.1 Internal Audit Service (IAS)  The IAS audit report on HR management and ethics  was issued in September 2019. Three very important  and four important recommendations were issued  in this audit.  Although four recommendations were closed by the  IAS following the corrective actions implemented by  ENISA, three important recommendation remained  open at the end of 2021, which were not fully  implemented within the set time frame.  4 See Regulation (EU) 2021/887 of the European Parliament  and of the Council of 20 May 2021 establishing the  European Cybersecurity Industrial, Technology and  Research Competence Centre and the Network of National  Coordination Centres (https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/ EN/TXT/?qid=1623160399041&uri=CELEX%3A32021R0887).  https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?qid=1623160399041&uri=CELEX%3A32021R0887 https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?qid=1623160399041&uri=CELEX%3A32021R0887  ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2021 93  PART II. Management  They delays are mainly imputable to the  reorganisation of ENISA stemming from the  adoption of the CSA. To better address the new  challenges under this new regulatory framework,  ENISA, with a stronger mandate and increased  financial resources, was significantly reorganised and  restructured with effect from 1 January 2021.  This had the consequence that many internal  processes had to be rethought to fit the structure as  approved by the Management Board in June 2020,  and have introduced new ways of working.  This affected the roll-out of the corrective HR  plan as initially planned with the IAS in late 2019.  A new timeline to implement the three remaining  recommendations was agreed with the IAS.  In 2021 the IAS conducted an audit on strategic  planning programming and performance  management in ENISA and issued its final audit report  in April 2022, with three important recommendations  that ENISA commits to address in the course of 2022  and onwards.  7.2 European Court of Auditors  In 2021 the ECA issued its report on the 2020  annual accounts of the agency5. In the ECA’s opinion,  the accounts of the agency for the year ended  31 December 2020 present fairly, in all material  respects, the financial position of the agency at  31 December 2020, the results of its operations,  its cash flows and the changes in net assets for the  year then ended, in accordance with its financial  regulation and with accounting rules adopted by  the Commission’s accounting officer.  5 Available online (https://www.enisa.europa.eu/about-enisa/ accounting-finance/).  Moreover, payments underlying the accounts for the  year ended 31 December 2020 are legal and regular  in all material respects, except for a weakness in  the delegation of financial rights whereby financial  transactions had been authorised without proper  financial delegation rights in place. This led to the  ECA’s qualified opinion on the legality and regularity  of the payments underlying the accounts.  It is important to note that these financial  transactions did not affect the reliability of the  financial records: these transactions would have been  processed by the Agency anyway, as all of them were  free of conflict and completed in pursuance of the  Agency’s objectives and for its official use.  As already reported in the 2020 annual activity  report, the Agency welcomed this audit finding and  a corrective action plan was immediately devised  to address this legal issue and to reinforce relevant  internal controls.  An additional independent and specific report was  requested on this matter from ENISA’s external  auditors, Mazars, in late 2021. It confirmed that these  transactions were duly justified in pursuance of the  Agency’s objectives and for its official use.  Following up on previous ECA observations, ENISA  adopted a sensitive functions policy in 2021 (entering  into force in May 2022) and is still reducing its usage  of interim staff.  European Court of Auditors audit on cybersecurity  of EU institutions, bodies and agencies  The ECA conducted in 2021 an audit on the level  of cybersecurity preparedness of EUIBAs. The scope  of the audit included three main questions, on the  key cybersecurity practices adopted across EUIBAs,  the efficiency of cooperation between EUIBAs on  The table below shows ENISA’s planned recruitment goals for 2020 to 2021.  Area Objective 2021  performance  2020  target  2021  target  Efficient  management  of selection  procedures  Reduction of time taken to hire (in line with the  standard EU HR definition, this is the time frame  set from the deadline for candidates to submit  applications until the signing of the reserve list  by the Executive Director)  4 months ≤ 5 months ≤ 5 months  Turnover of staff Reduced turnover rate of statutory staff  (temporary agents and contract agents)  3 % < 15 % < 15 %  Staff performance  management  Implementation and monitoring of the appraisal  and reclassification exercises (launching and  completion of the exercises)  100 % 100 % 100 %  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/about-enisa/accounting-finance/ https://www.enisa.europa.eu/about-enisa/accounting-finance/  9494  cybersecurity, and the adequacy of the cybersecurity  support provided to EUIBAs by ENISA and CERT-EU.  ENISA was specifically surveyed by ECA to that end.  The final ECA audit report was published in March  20226. ENISA welcomed the recommendations and  observations of the report7, which highlight the key  roles that ENISA and CERT-EU can play in increasing  the level of cyber preparedness of EUIBAs and  underline the need for adequate resources to do so.  7.3 Ex-post control evaluation results  In 2021, ENISA performed ex-post controls of  financial transactions in accordance with the ENISA  financial regulation’s Article 45(8) and (9) for the  financial year 2020.  A total of 254 financial transactions were scrutinised,  representing 16.38 % of all the Agency’s financial  transactions and 80.38 % of the Agency’s budget.  Four recommendations were made and none of them  was critical. In particular, the financial delegations and  underlying financial circuit have since been revised  and its implementation has been taken effect as from  1st January 2021. Acknowledging the efforts made by  ENISA, the ECA has deemed that these weaknesses  have been properly addressed by ENISA as the  related observations have been flagged as completed  in its follow-up of previous year's observations in its  2021 annual audit report of the Agency.  8 FOLLOW UP OF RECOMMENDATIONS  AND ACTION PLANS FOR AUDITS AND  EVALUATIONS  As highlighted in Sections 2.7.1 and 2.7.2 above,  ENISA took the necessary steps to address the ECA  and IAS findings.  All recommendations from past audits have been  addressed, with the exception of the three remaining  important recommendations from the IAS 2019 audit  on HR management, which will be implemented in  accordance with the new agreed timeline.  6 Available online (https://www.eca.europa.eu/en/Pages/ DocItem.aspx?did=60922).  7 Available online (https://www.enisa.europa.eu/news/enisa- news/securing-eu-institutions-bodies-and-agencies).  9 FOLLOW-UP OF RECOMMENDATIONS  ISSUED FOLLOWING INVESTIGATIONS BY  THE EUROPEAN ANTI-FRAUD OFFICE  The recommendations issued by the European Anti- Fraud Office were endorsed by the Agency during  2021, following all the necessary steps provided in the  regulatory framework.  10 FOLLOW-UP OF OBSERVATIONS FROM  THE DISCHARGE AUTHORITY  In relation to the 2020 discharge, as decided by  the European Parliament, the Executive Director of  the Agency was granted discharge regarding the  implementation of the agency’s budget for the 2020  financial year. The closure of the Agency’s accounts  for the 2020 financial year was also approved by the  discharge authority.  In reply to observations and comments made by  the European Parliament in its discharge of 2020,  the Agency provided further information on actions  taken to address previously identified areas for  improvement and highlighted some actions taken  that are of interest to the European Parliament.  In particular:  the Agency took the necessary steps to mitigate  the weaknesses identified by the auditors by  strengthening its internal controls and updating its  internal processes for procurement procedures;  to better tackle the concerns on recruitment and  gender balance, ENISA redefined its recruitment  strategy as from 2020;  the sensitive post policy was adopted by the  Executive Director on 22 December 2021.  11 ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT  The Greek authorities concluded a lease agreement  on behalf of ENISA for its headquarters building in  Athens, which was fully operational as of 1 July 2021.  The building and office space are rented by the Greek  authorities for ENISA’s use. No longer occupying  a shared building will enable ENISA to set a wider set  of green measures to be implemented, as all electrical  systems such as heating/cooling/lighting will be  directly controlled by the agency, therefore enabling  it to directly monitor those systems and assess the  impact of any greening measures implemented.  During the set-up of the new office, the path to  https://www.eca.europa.eu/en/Pages/DocItem.aspx?did=60922 https://www.eca.europa.eu/en/Pages/DocItem.aspx?did=60922 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/news/enisa-news/securing-eu-institutions-bodies-and-agencies https://www.enisa.europa.eu/news/enisa-news/securing-eu-institutions-bodies-and-agencies  ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2021 95  PART II. Management  carbon neutrality was already visible. The agency  renovated the office space to better align with  operational needs and incorporate considerations  of greater energy savings and responsible  energy consumption.  12 ASSESSMENT BY MANAGEMENT  The achievement of the work programme was  far ahead of management’s expectations across  many areas thanks not only to the new streamlined  organisational structure, which mirrors the CSA and  ENISA’s strategy, but also to the additional processes  such as the inception and closure of projects by the  Management Team.  The introduction of inception and closure of all  operational projects by the Management Team  allowed for enhanced synergies and efficiencies  across the Agency, and ensured that stakeholders  were consulted to align the outcomes of the project  with their needs. Project managers were asked to  present their project plans according to a predefined  template of questions. The Management Team would  assess the projects objectives, the quality of the  plans and resources required, including stakeholders’  input into the scope of the project, after which the  Management Team provided its own input and the  project was approved for implementation. Project  closures followed a similar process, in which project  managers presented the outcome of the work to  the Management Team, including feedback from  stakeholders, after which the Management Team  provided input and the project was deemed delivered.  The achievement of the work programme has been  described in detail under each of the activities,  including the added value of each of the outputs.  PART II (B) EXTERNAL EVALUATIONS  In 2021, ENISA continued to follow up actions from the ex-post evaluation of 2019 performed by external  consultants. The key findings of the report were presented using the following criteria: effectiveness, efficiency,  coherence and coordination, relevance, and EU added value. These findings were followed by an action plan  composed of concrete recommendations to adjust and improve ENISA’s activities. Recommendations included  the reworking of KPIs, balancing and tailoring the agency’s activities and outputs, and finally reinforcing the  position of the Agency within the cybersecurity ecosystem.  To this end the Agency developed new KPIs and metrics to measure the performance of each of the activities.  These KPIs and metrics are being reported for the first time in the 2021 annual activity report and will be used  a basis for measuring performance in the years to come. The activities and outputs in the work programme of  the Agency are now aligned with the relevant articles of the CSA, thus providing a coherent way to measure the  performance of each activity against the mandate of the Agency.  96  III  ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2021 97  1 EFFECTIVENESS OF INTERNAL  CONTROL SYSTEMS  Internal control is established in the context of  ENISA’s fundamental budgetary principles and  associated with sound financial management. Internal  control is broadly defined in the Agency’s financial  regulation as a process designed to provide  reasonable assurance of achieving objectives. This  definition very much mirrors the standard definition  of internal control adopted by the Committee  of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway  Commission (COSO) (https://www.coso.org).  In this context, ENISA adopted its internal control  framework by Management Board Decision  MB/2019/12. It is based on the relevant framework  of the European Commission (which follows the  COSO framework) and includes five internal control  components and 17 internal control principles.  The five internal control components are the building  blocks that underpin the structure of the framework.  They are interrelated and must be present and  effective at all levels of ENISA for internal control  over operations to be considered effective.  Each component comprises one or more internal  control principles. Working with these principles  helps to provide reasonable assurance that  ENISA’s objectives have been met. The principles  specify the actions required for the internal control  to be effective.  In order to assess the components and principles  of the internal control framework, a set of 57  indicators has been adopted (as part of MB/2019/12).  The indicators are assessed individually and  supported by relevant evidence.  The assessment of the internal controls is an  important part of ENISA’s internal control framework,  which is conducted on an annual basis. For 2021,  this assessment was based on the indicators of the  framework, as well as additional information from  specific (risk) assessment reports, audit findings and  other relevant sources. The assessment also followed  the related guidance and templates developed under  the EU Agencies Performance Development Network.  1.1 Assessment of control environment  component  The control environment component consists of five  principles, as described below.  Principle 1: ENISA demonstrates commitment to  integrity and ethical values  The Agency promotes yearly training on ethics and  integrity. The management encourages all staff to  take these courses. In order to increase the level of  PART III ASSESSMENT OF  THE EFFECTIVENESS  OF THE INTERNAL  CONTROL SYSTEMS  https://www.coso.org  98  participation, the Agency will consider a diversity  of training plans/programmes to address different  levels of staff knowledge/maturity. Various types  of information material are at the disposal of the  staff, such as training content and the most up-to- date reports by the Commission’s Investigation and  Disciplinary Office. ENISA’s code of conduct, including  the code of good administrative behaviour, is due to  be published in 2022.  Principle 2: ENISA’s management exercises  responsibility for overseeing the development and  performance of internal control  The declaration of assurance of the Executive Director  is included in the annual activity report (Part V). All  authorising officers by delegation signed their own  declarations of assurance covering their areas.  Following the ECA’s 2020 audit finding (reported in  ENISA’s 2020 AAR) regarding the lack of delegation  for a staff member, the Agency took immediate  action in 2021 to assess if the use of ENISA’s financial  resources had respected the principle of sound  financial management, in particular in the context  of any situation giving rise to potential conflicts of  interests. In addition, corrective actions were taken  as regards the delegation of authorising officers and  relevant internal controls.  Principle 3: ENISA’s management establishes  structures, reporting lines, and appropriate  authorities and responsibilities in the pursuit  of objectives  Every month the Agency publishes on its intranet  the adopted and updated organisation charts.  The organisation charts are updated based on the  Agency’s overall objectives.  The Executive Director’s Decision 2020/146 on  delegation of authority, which entered into force on  1 January 2021, describes the financial circuits and  all financial delegations, ensuring a clear segregation  of duties. The specific decision limits the number  of authorising officers, covering all delegations of  financial transactions, streamlining the profiles and  enhancing efficiency and effectiveness. Importantly,  it includes a sunset clause to end all subdelegated  authority automatically three months after the  change of the person of the Executive Director, unless  the new Executive Director explicitly confirms the  delegations in place.  The IAS conducted an audit on strategic planning,  programming and performance management in  ENISA in 2021. According to the IAS draft audit report  (final report to be published in 2022), ENISA’s overall  management and control systems put in place for  strategic planning, programming and performance  management are adequately designed, and efficiently  and effectively implemented, and support the  Agency in achieving its business objectives. The three  potential inconsistencies that have been identified  by the IAS (in the areas of staff appraisal and  performance assessment, performance management  guidelines, and project management guidelines) will  be addressed under ongoing actions during 2022.  Principle 4: ENISA demonstrates commitment to  attracting, developing and retaining competent  individuals in alignment with its objectives  The publication of ENISA’s vacancy notices in  2021 was widely advertised via various channels  (including ENISA’s website and specific platforms such  as Euractiv).  The turnover of staff was low (3 %) in 2021, which  shows ENISA’s ability to retain staff members  in the Agency.  All staff members performed their CDRs within 2021;  the relevant dialogues were held between the staff  members and their line managers.  ENISA’s overall  management and  control systems put  in place for strategic  planning, programming  and performance  management are  adequately designed,  and efficiently  and effectively  implemented, and  support the Agency in  achieving its business  objectives.  ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2021 99  PART III. Assessment of the effectiveness of the internal control systems  In order to develop and retain competent individuals,  a learning and development policy is adopted every  year. This policy is detailed and includes the training  plan as well as the budgetary resources needed.  Internal mobility is available to all staff. Two  possibilities are offered to the staff. They can apply  for internal vacancies or request internal mobility  during the CDR exercise. In addition, staff members  had the possibility in 2021 of participating in the  horizontal teams, established under the new  organisational structure, which also constitutes  a form of internal mobility.  In 2021 a task force was established by the Executive  Director to review the large-scale recruitment  exercise of 2020 (temporary agents / contract agents /  heads of unit) with a view to establishing lessons  learned and providing resultant recommendations  for the future. The task force’s observations will be  further analysed and considered in the context of the  Agency’s broader recruitment policy.  Principle 5: ENISA holds accountable for their  internal control responsibilities in the pursuit  of objectives  The Agency reviews its annual objectives during  the year. While mid-term reviews are planned,  significant effort is put on into the ex-ante evaluation  and continuous monitoring of projects through the  weekly Management Team meetings. In particular,  each project starts with an inception, may be further  reviewed for guidance and then is finally presented  to the Management Team for closure. This ensures  a clear view and follow-up of the annual objectives  during the whole year.  In order to be able to deliver the amended or new  objectives, some job descriptions can be reviewed  when needed. In 2021, there was no revision of job  descriptions, as a detailed exercise was performed in  2020 during the Agency’s reorganisation.  The staff’s efficiency, abilities and conduct in  the service are assessed annually against the  expected standards of conducts and set objectives.  Promotion of staff is decided after consideration of  the comparative merits of eligible staff, taking into  account their appraisal reports.  1.2 Assessment of risk assessment  component  The risk assessment component consists of four  principles, as presented below.  Principle 6: ENISA specifies objectives with  sufficient clarity to enable the identification and  assessment of risks relating to objectives  On the basis of ENISA’s strategy, adopted in  2020, the Executive Director’s Decision 35/2020  on the internal structures was adopted, elaborating  in detail the mission statements of all units and  teams (amended by Decision 3/2022 to reflect the  latest organisational structure and consequent  mission statements).  In addition, the adoption of ENISA’s SPD is based  on input from all units and teams across the Agency,  and consultation with stakeholders, before being  formally adopted by the agency’s Management  Board. Throughout the year, the agency’s outputs are  incepted, reviewed and finalised in close consultation  with the stakeholders, including ENISA’s Management  Board, Advisory Group and NLO Network.  ENISA uses objectives as a basis for allocating  resources to achieve policy, operational and financial  performance goals. In 2021, the Agency’s budget  implementation rate was 99.51 %, while the budget  outturn was 98.57 %.  Principle 7: ENISA identifies risks to the  achievement of its objectives across the  organisation and analyses risks as a basis for  determining how the risks should be managed  ENISA identifies and assesses risks at the various  organisational levels, analysing internal and external  factors. Management and staff are involved in the  process at the appropriate level. ENISA estimates  the significance of the risks identified and determines  how to respond to significant risks, considering how  each one should be managed and whether to accept,  avoid, reduce or share the risk.  While risks are identified in the context of different  processes (during the inception/revision/finalisation  of projects, as part of the business continuity project,  in the yearly ICT security risk assessments, in the  assessment of sensitive functions, etc.), a holistic  centralised risk management approach has not yet  been implemented at Agency-wide level. To this  end, in 2022 ENISA will kick off the development  of a formalised enterprise risk management  methodology that will be used to consolidate risks  and contribute to the maintenance and continuous  updating of a central ENISA risk register.  100  Principle 8: ENISA considers the potential for fraud  in assessing risks to the achievement of objectives  The Agency’s anti-fraud strategy was updated in 2021  and formally adopted by Management Board Decision  MB/2021/5. All objectives and actions for 2021 were  delivered, with the exception of the code for good  administrative behaviour, which is due for 2022.  A dedicated web page was created on ENISA’s intranet  where all regulations, documents, training materials  and a toolbox are now available to all the staff.  The course in fraud prevention is part of the training  in ethics and integrity, and was delivered in 2021.  An advanced course on fraud prevention and  ENISA’s ant-fraud strategy was scheduled for 2022.  Principle 9: ENISA identifies and analyses  significant change  Change is managed via different processes within  the Agency. At operational level, continuous  monitoring of the work programme activities via  the weekly Management Team meetings enables  the identification and analysis of significant change  (thus enabling further reflection of this change in  internal activities). The establishment of dedicated  Committees (IT Management Committee, Budget  Management Committee, IPR Management  Committee) further supports change management  at corporate level. During the reporting year 2021,  change and subsequent risks have been managed in  this context, considering also changes arising from  the external environment, as for example the change  in tele-working conditions that was deemed necessary  within 2021, due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The  establishment of a comprehensive risk management  framework within 2022 will further enhance the  Agency’s possibilities to identify and manage change.  The maintenance of a centralised risk register is part  of this framework.  1.3 Assessment of control activities  component  The control activities component consists of three  principles, as presented below.  Principle 10: ENISA selects and develops control  activities that contribute to the mitigation of  risks to the achievement of objectives to an  acceptable level  Under the new ENISA organisational structure there  is continuous monitoring of performance, at both  the beginning (inception) and closure (finalisation) of  projects, as well as throughout the year with reporting  and/or validation at the weekly Management Team  meetings. In addition, both the scope and the  performance of the indicators are continuously  validated with external stakeholders, in particular  the NLO Network and ENISA’s Advisory Group, as  well as various ad hoc working groups established in  different thematic areas.  In order to ensure a high level of control, the Agency  applies ex-ante verification to 100 % of its financial  transactions. In order to complete this control, an  ex-post control verification is performed every year.  In 2021, a sample of 254 transactions was selected,  following ENISA’s relevant policy/guidelines for  ex-post verification. These transactions represent  80.38 % of the total by value and 16.38 % by volume.  Roles and responsibilities are being reviewed within  the Agency with a view to ensure segregation of  duties where needed. Identified weakness identified  by the European Court of Auditors in the area of  internal controls has been addressed through  the reorganisation. Another area that requires  risk mitigation is the ENISA Financial sector that  is currently led by the acting Head of Sector who  is also in charge for accounting and compliance.  A new recruitment is planned in the course of 2022.  While controls were integrated into different  processes (e.g. inception process, validation with  stakeholders, management committees), the holistic  internal control assessment was not fully formalised  at Agency-wide level. In addition, further development  of the Agency’s business continuity plan is needed.  The internal control framework assessment for  2021 provided specific recommendations to address  these elements.  In 2021, the sensitive functions policy was adopted by  the Executive Director’s Decision 2021/86 (entering  into force in May 2022). The decision provides a high- level methodology for defining the sensitive functions  at ENISA, together with broad categories of mitigation  measures that can be applied to manage the risks.  Following the adoption of the decision, the first risk  assessment of the Agency’s sensitive functions was  conducted by the Executive Director’s Office in March  2022. This risk assessment defined the sensitive  functions at Agency level. The risk assessment  (methodology and result) was endorsed by  ENISA’s Management Team in March 2022.  ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2021 101  PART III. Assessment of the effectiveness of the internal control systems  Principle 11: ENISA selects and develops  general control over technology to support the  achievement of objectives  In 2021, following a proposal by ENISA’s ITMC, the  Agency adopted its IT strategic framework, which  also covers information security at strategic level. In  addition, following the Commission’s draft proposal  for the regulations on common binding cybersecurity  rules and on information security, a process for  reviewing the agency’s IT security framework was  initiated and will be continued in 2022.  Every year, the Agency performs an IT security risk  assessment (under the control of ENISA’s Information  Security Officer). The IT security risk assessment was  concluded in 2021. A broader IT risk assessment,  however, including a business continuity plan, was  not conducted at the Agency. Still, a register of all  IT systems at the Agency (and their owners) was  created, as part of ENISA’s IT strategy.  The Agency uses a register in which security  incidents and personal data breaches are recorded.  In particular, each security incident or personal  data breach is documented in the register based on  specific incident-reporting templates (including date,  description of incident, those involved, causes, risk  assessment and actions taken).  In 2021 there was one incident that was assessed  as potentially being of high risk. In particular, in  July 2021, due to the exploitation of a zero-day  vulnerability, unauthorised access was obtained to  a number of mailboxes of the Agency’s corporate  email server. The incident did not affect any other  corporate or operational system of ENISA and did  not pose any threat to ENISA’s operational mandate.  Once the incident was identified, ENISA, in co- operation with CERT-EU and competent authorities,  conducted a full forensic investigation. The findings  have been shared with all relevant parties and  Member States. ENISA took immediate actions to  contain the event and assess its impact.  All necessary  actions were taken in compliance with the Regulation  (EU) 1725/2018, including the timely notification of  the European Data Protection Supervisor.  In addition, an internal Task Force was created to  establish the technical facts that led to the incident.  The Task Force report, which was submitted to the  ED on December 2021, demonstrated a number of  gaps in the IT governance at ENISA, as well as in the  related IT policy and procedural framework. The task  force recommended a number of corrective actions  to that end (action plan), which were endorsed by the  Agency’s Management Team and further presented to  and adopted by the ENISA’s Management Board. The  action plan includes specific timelines and responsible  actors within ENISA for all foreseen actions.  Principle 12: ENISA deploys control activities  through policies that establish what is expected  and in procedures that put policies into action  In 2021, the majority of recommendations stemming  from the IAS performance audits were addressed and  submitted to IAS. However, there are still some open  findings to be addressed in 2022.  The Agency keeps its register of exceptions updated  on a yearly basis. There is a dedicated workflow  in Paperless to report an exception. The workflow  contain the link to the form that needs to be filled in  by those responsible for the exception.  For 2021, three exceptions are reported herein, none  of them of a critical nature, as follows.  1.  While the timelines of the staff appraisal exercise  were respected, there was a delay in the timeline  for reclassification; in particular, the appeal  period had to be shortened by 5 working days,  which is a deviation from the Agency’s relevant  rule (MB/10/16), which allows 10 working days  for staff members to appeal. The delay was due  to additional validation of the data, which was  necessary in order to meet ENISA’s obligations and  ensure an equal and fair comparison of merits for  all ENISA staff.  2.  A service contract for cleaning services for the  amount of EUR 28 000 was awarded directly  (extension of the service with the same contractor),  instead of launching a procurement procedure.  The exception was necessary for business  continuity purposes and did not expose the agency  to any serious legal risk.  In order to ensure  a high level of control,  the Agency applies  ex-ante verification to  100 % of its financial  transactions.  102  3.  In 2021, the Agency paid the amount of  EUR 18 800 and committed an additional amount  of EUR 24 900 (equivalent to a total expenditure  of EUR 43 700) for Greek value added tax (VAT),  which was not exempted by the local Greek  administration in due time. This issue mainly  relates to invoices issued before 2020 for which  the non-exemption of VAT was identified only  in 2021. The VAT exemption process has since  been revised to improve its monitoring by  processing digital copies instead of using hard  copies, which left an insufficient audit trail of the  work performed.  The Agency performs a yearly external ex-post  evaluation of its activities based on the effectiveness,  efficiency, coherence, coordination and added value  of its activities.  1.4 Assessment of information and  communication component  The information and communication component  consists of three principles, as presented below.  Principle 13: ENISA obtains or generates and  uses relevant quality information to support the  functioning of internal control  The Agency registers and archives all its official  documents (outgoing and incoming) in a specific  registration system. In 2021 the Agency kicked off  its migration to the ARES registration system of the  European Commission. The completion of this project  is expected in 2022.This new development supports  the principle of single administration (same tools and  processes used by staff internally) within ENISA.  ENISA uses various tools for internal communications.  The most common tools are ENISA’s intranet, email,  Skype for Business and WebEx.  The Agency can retrieve 100 % of the documents  requested by the IAS/ECA. All documents are archived  in ENISA’s intranet, Paperless and financial report  requests using Business Object and ABAC.  Principle 14: ENISA communicates internally  the information, including objectives and  responsibilities for internal control, that  is necessary to support the functioning  of internal control  There is transparency in the Agency regarding  objectives, challenges, actions taken or to be taken,  and results achieved. The minutes of the weekly  Management Team meetings minutes are made  available by email to all staff. In addition, weekly  question and answer sessions for all staff on different  aspects of the new MIPorganisation were organised  throughout 2021.  Mid-term reviews are used to communicate  objectives achieved and ongoing, while substantial  effort is put into ex-ante evaluation of the projects,  starting with a detailed inception proposed during  the Management Team meetings. The same  projects may then be reviewed for guidance during  the Management Team meetings and will then be  presented to the Management Team for finalisation.  This ensures a clear view and follow-up of the annual  objectives during the year.  There is a separate communication line for  whistleblowing arrangements. The basic principles,  definitions and reporting mechanism are described in  ENISA’s whistleblowing policy.  Principle 15: ENISA communicates with external  parties about matters affecting the functioning  of internal control  The Agency’s press coverage is monitored monthly  and quarterly, detailing the media used. The most  recent corporate communication strategy is from May  2021. While certain actions under the communication  strategy have been endorsed at Management  Team level, the Agency is also working to provide  the new stakeholder strategy (to take effect during  2022). The awareness raising and education team  actively cooperates with the communication  sector (under the Executive Director’s Office)  on ENISA’s stakeholder strategy.  The Agency communicates about its internal control  matters through the annual activity report.  1.5 Assessment of monitoring activities  component  The monitoring activities component consists of two  principles, as presented below.  Principle 16: ENISA obtains or generates and  uses relevant quality information to support the  functioning of internal control  ENISA continuously monitors the performance of  the internal control system with tools that make  it possible to identify internal control deficiencies,  register and assess the results of controls, and control  deviations and exceptions.  ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2021 103  PART III. Assessment of the effectiveness of the internal control systems  The Agency follows up, in a timely manner, the  recommendations of the auditors, as well as risks  identified in the ex-ante and ex-post controls and  relevant evaluations. While four recommendations  were closed by the IAS during 2021, following the  corrective actions implemented by ENISA, three  important recommendations remain open and have  not been fully implemented within the set time frame.  The delays are mainly imputable to the reorganisation  of ENISA stemming from the adoption of the CSA.  This affected the roll-out of the HR corrective  plan as initially planned with the IAS in late 2019.  A new timeline to implement the three remaining  recommendations was agreed with the IAS.  Principle 17: ENISA assesses internal control  deficiencies and communicates them in a timely  manner to those parties responsible for taking  corrective action, including senior management  as appropriate  The deficiencies are communicated to the parties  responsible and to the Management Team. Mitigation  measures are addressed immediately. They are  planned and have a date for implementation. The  Agency follows up these deadlines closely as well as  the result of the mitigation measures proposed.  2 CONCLUSIONS OF ASSESSMENT OF  INTERNAL CONTROL SYSTEMS  The overall assessment shows that the internal  controls at ENISA provide reasonable assurance  that policies, processes, tasks and behaviours of the  Agency, taken together, facilitate its effective and  efficient operation, help to ensure the quality of  internal and external reporting, and help to ensure  compliance with its regulations. That being said, some  improvements are needed in certain principles, in  order to increase effectiveness and ensure proper  implementation of the internal controls in the future.  These improvements include the refinement of the  Agency’s internal control framework indicators, the  establishment of an enterprise risk management  framework, the revision of the IT governance and  underlying policy and procedural framework, the  revision of the Agency’s recruitment policy, as well the  update of the Agency’s Business Continuity Plan, The  follow up on these improvements will be assessed for  the next mid-term review of the Agency.  3 STATEMENT OF THE INTERNAL  CONTROL COORDINATOR IN CHARGE  OF RISK MANAGEMENT AND INTERNAL  CONTROL  I, the undersigned,  manager in charge of risk management and internal  control within the European Union Agency for  Cybersecurity (ENISA),  in my capacity as manager in charge of risk  management and internal control, declare that, in  2021 risk management and internal controls was  responsibility of the Executive Directors Office and  this area was identified in problem analysis that led  to reorganisation of ENISA effective as of 2021. In  accordance with ENISA’s internal control framework,  I have reported my advice and recommendations on  the overall state of internal control in the Agency to  the Executive Director.  I hereby certify that the information provided in the  present consolidated annual activity report and in its  annexes is, to the best of my knowledge, accurate,  reliable and complete.  Athens, 30th June 2022  Ingrida Taurina  104  IV  ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2021 105  1 REVIEW OF THE ELEMENTS  SUPPORTING ASSURANCE  The declaration of assurance, provided by the  authorising officer, is mainly based on the following  three pillars:  1.  regular monitoring of the KPIs set for operational,  administrative and financial tasks through the  formal periodical management reporting;  2.  effectiveness of the internal controls and  processes to detect weaknesses and to identify  areas for improvement;  3.  assessment and reports from independent bodies  (external evaluators, financial auditors (ECA,  complemented by a private audit firm), internal  auditors (IAS), etc.).  As highlighted in the previous sections, by the  operational, administrative and financial KPIs, and  by the positive opinion of the ECA on the reliability  of the accounts and on the legality and regularity  of the transactions underlying the accounts, and as  no critical observations have been formulated by  the IAS, the management has sufficient assurance  that ENISA is adequately managed to safeguard its  financial resources and to pursue the tasks which it  was entrusted with.  2 RESERVATIONS  Considering the results of the 2021 annual audits  performed by the ECA and the IAS, the 2021 results  of the internal controls (ex-post controls, review of  the register of exceptions, internal control framework  assessment) and the 2021 results of the key financial  and operational indicators, the authorising officer can  conclude that ENISA operated in 2021 in such a way  as to manage the risks appropriately.  In addition, the authorising officer has reasonable  assurance that the allocated resources were used for  their intended purpose, in compliance with the legal  framework and in accordance with the principle of  sound financial management.  PART IV MANAGEMENT  ASSURANCE  106  V  ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2021 107  PART V DECLARATION  OF ASSURANCE  I, the undersigned,  Juhan LEPASSAAR,  Executive Director of the European Union Agency for Cybersecurity,  in my capacity as authorising officer,  declare that the information contained in this report gives a true and fair8 view of the state of the Agency’s  affairs, and state that I have reasonable assurance that the resources assigned to the activities described in  this report have been used for their intended purpose and in accordance with the principles of sound financial  management, and that the control procedures put in place give the necessary guarantees concerning the legality  and regularity of the underlying transactions.  This reasonable assurance is based on my own judgement and on the information at my disposal, such as the  results of the self-assessment, ex-post controls, the work of the internal audit capability, the observations of the  Internal Audit Service and the lessons learned from the reports of the Court of Auditors for years prior to the  year of this declaration.  I confirm that I am not aware of anything not reported here that could harm the interests of the Agency.  Athens, 30th June 2022  Juhan LEPASSAAR  Executive Director  8 True and fair in this context means reliable, complete and accurate.  108  A  ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2021 109  KPI Metric  Unit (of

The allocation was determined according to the direct  budget and number of FTEs reported for each activity, with the indirect budget being assigned based on drivers  such as direct FTEs.  The following assumptions were used in the simplified activity-based costing methodology.  •  The direct budget is the actual cost of each of the nine operational activities described in Part I of this CAAR  in terms of services, goods, and missions.  •  The indirect budget is the actual cost of salaries and allowances, buildings, IT, equipment and miscellaneous  operating costs attributable to each activity. The indirect budget was allocated to activities based on drivers.  The main driver for cost allocation was the number of direct FTEs used for each operational activity in 2021.  •  For the purpose of the allocation of human and financial resources, an Executive Director’s Office activity  (Activity 10 as described in Part I) (budget and FTEs), which includes coordination, compliance, communication  and administration, was allocated to all of the Agency’s operational activities.  •  For the purpose of the allocation of human and financial resources, a Corporate Support Service activity  (Activity 11 as described in Part I), including HR, IT services, procurement and finance, facilities and logistics,  was allocated to all of the Agency’s operational activities.

In accordance with the provisions of the Seat agreement (Greek law 4627/2019) concluded with the Greek  authorities, ENISA received a contribution of EUR 219 110 to cover the 2021 leasing expenditure on its offices.  Active service-level agreements in 2021:  • with Cedefop for the purposes of increasing cooperation and sharing services between the two agencies;  •  with the Body of European Regulators for Electronic Communications for the provision of electronic data  backup services;  • with the European Food Safety Authority for a shared support office under the EU Agencies Network;  • with the European Union Intellectual Property Office for disaster recovery services.  132132  ANNEX 7 ENVIRONMENTAL  MANAGEMENT The normal activities of the Agency were materially affected by the fallout related to COVID-19 for the majority  of 2021. ENISA continued to implement, to the greatest extent allowed by its infrastructure and location, its  established greening measures such as recycling of office materials, reduction in electricity usage for lighting  and heating/cooling, the use of videoconferencing equipment instead of face-to-face meetings involving  travel, the use of teleworking, provision of bicycle racks to promote bicycling, the use of public transport and  implementing green public procurement.  Owing to restrictions imposed for the best part of 2021, such as 50 % teleworking for staff and restricted travel  for work, there were many areas in which significant benefits were realised with regard to adopting a more  environmentally friendly workplace. With the majority of staff teleworking 50 % from home, the carbon footprint  of each staff member was significantly reduced; they eschewed EU-wide business travel in favour of video  conferencing meetings instead; printing at the office was substantially reduced.  The Greek authorities concluded a lease agreement on behalf of ENISA for its headquarters building in  Athens, which was fully operational as of 1 July 2021. The building and office space are rented by the Greek  authorities for ENISA’s use. No longer occupying a shared building will enable a wider set of green measures  to be implemented, as all electrical systems such as heating/cooling/lighting will be directly controlled by the  Agency, therefore enabling it to directly monitor those systems and assess the impact of any greening measures  implemented. During the set-up of the new office, the path to carbon neutrality was already visible. The Agency  renovated the office space to better align with operational needs and incorporate considerations of more  efficient energy savings and responsible energy consumption.  The European Commission has determined that all sectors of the economy, including all EU institutions and  bodies, must contribute to making Europe become the first climate neutral continent by 2050. With this goal,  ENISA embraced the EU’s climate targets to ensure the climate neutrality of its operations by 2030.  ENISA will thus finally be able to commence assessment and initial planning for implementation  of the eco-management and audit scheme certification (EMAS) for its new main office building.  2022 will be a milestone for the agency on the path to carbon neutrality as it engages in the eco-management  and audit scheme for the first time, and expects to take action such as sourcing renewable energy and offsetting  emissions from work-related travel by staff members and visitors to ENISA premises.

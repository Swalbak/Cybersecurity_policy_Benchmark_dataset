We all know that cyber security is a global chal- lenge and one country alone cannot ensure its  security in cyberspace. Therefore, it is extremely  important to find ways to make our digital world  secure together.  The NCSI provides an overview of the cyber security  capacity of countries, pointing out good practices  and showing which aspects could be improved. The  NCSI is based on publicly available evidence, which  is presented on the NCSI website: www.ncsi.ega.ee.  Currently, the index has 100 countries in the rank-  ing list. The data collection continues and we have  planned to include most of the countries to the  NCSI by the end of 2018. If your country does not  appear in the index and you could provide relevant  information, please contact us at ncsi@ega.ee.  Our idea is to provide continuous developments  on an ongoing basis. We do not publish annual  iterations of the ranking list. When we receive in-  formation about new evidence, we will check it and  update the website within a month. If you are able  to provide evidence about a country, we encourage  you to contact us at ncsi@ega.ee.  Raul Rikk  NCSI Project manager  Programme Director of National Cyber Security e-Governance Academy  New aspects of version 2.0  The new version of the index takes into account  the cyber security principles developed in the Eu-  ropean Union in recent years. It includes the most  important aspects of network and information se-  curity, electronic identification, trust services, per-  sonal data protection and many other aspects.  The NCSI web environment is also updated. Now it  is compatible with different devices and provides a  better overview of the countries’ cyber security ca-  pacities. We have developed different comparison  tools that help to analyse the current situation of  countries and place it into regional or global con-  text.  I would like to thank everyone, who contributed to  the development of this index – all state officials,  organisations, companies and individual experts  around the world. My special thanks go to the NCSI  core team members Agu Kivimägi and Marit Lani,  who have made significant effort to develop ver-  sion 2.0 and ensure the quality of the data. Also, I  would like to thank Kala Ruudus Ltd. and especial- ly Rene Saare, who developed the new website for  the index.  Methodology  Purpose  The National Cyber Security Index is a global index,  which measures the preparedness of countries to  prevent cyber threats and manage cyber incidents.  The NCSI is also a database with publicly available  evidence materials and a tool for national cyber se-  curity capacity building.  NCSI Development Process  The index has been developed in 5 steps: 1) Identification of fundamental cyber threats at  the national level  2) Identification of national level cyber security  measures and capacities 3) Selection of important and measurable aspects 4) Development of cyber security indicators  5) Grouping of cyber security indicators  Focus and scope  The NCSI focuses on measurable aspects of cyber  security implemented by the central government: 1)  Legislation in force – legal acts, regulations,  official orders, etc. 2) Established units – existing organisations,  departments, etc. 3) Cooperation formats – council, committee,  official working group, etc. 4) Outcomes / Products – policies, exercises,  technologies, websites, programmes, etc.  Structure  The NCSI has 3 categories, 12 capacities and 46  indicators.

The values  are given by the expert group according to the fol- lowing consideration: 1 point – a legal act that regulates a specific area 2–3 points – a unit that has a specific cyber security  responsibility 2 points – an official cooperation format 1–3 points – an outcome / product (document, ex-  ercise, technology, etc.)  Evidence  Country ratings are based on public evidence: 1) Legal acts  2) Official documents 3) Official websites  NCSI Score  The NCSI Score shows the percentage the coun-  try received  from the maximum  value of the in-  dicators. The maximum  NCSI Score is always 100  (100%) regardless of whether indicators are added  or removed.  Digital Development Level (DDL)  In addition to the NCSI Score, the index table also  shows the Digital Development Level (DDL). The  DDL is calculated according to the ICT Development  Index (IDI) and Networked Readiness Index (NRI).  The DDL is the average percentage the country re-  ceived from the maximum value of both indices.  Difference  The Difference shows the relationship between the  NCSI Score and DDL. A positive result shows that the  country’s cyber security development is in accordance  with, or ahead of, its digital development. A negative  result shows, that the country’s digital society is more  advanced than the national cyber security area.  The NCSI Score shows  the percentage of the  maximum points  NCSI Score  =  Country Points X 100  Maximum Points  The DDL shows the  average % of the IDI  and NRI max values  DDL  =  IDI % + NRI %  2  The Difference shows  the relationship  between NCSI and DDL  Difference  =  NCSI Score  DD  Established unit  O cial cooperation format  Outcomes / Products  egal act Point  Points  Points  Points  1  2  2  3  3  1  Evidence  Legal  acts  O cial  documents  O cial  e sites  Ranking  Rank Country National Cyber Security  Index Digital Development  Level Difference  1.

We all know that cyber security is a global chal- lenge and one country alone cannot ensure its  security in cyberspace. Therefore, it is extremely  important to find ways to make our digital world  secure together.  The NCSI provides an overview of the cyber security  capacity of countries, pointing out good practices  and showing which aspects could be improved. The  NCSI is based on publicly available evidence, which  is presented on the NCSI website: www.ncsi.ega.ee.  Currently, the index has 100 countries in the rank-  ing list. The data collection continues and we have  planned to include most of the countries to the  NCSI by the end of 2018. If your country does not  appear in the index and you could provide relevant  information, please contact us at ncsi@ega.ee.  Our idea is to provide continuous developments  on an ongoing basis. We do not publish annual  iterations of the ranking list. When we receive in-  formation about new evidence, we will check it and  update the website within a month. If you are able  to provide evidence about a country, we encourage  you to contact us at ncsi@ega.ee.  Raul Rikk  NCSI Project manager  Programme Director of National Cyber Security e-Governance Academy  New aspects of version 2.0  The new version of the index takes into account  the cyber security principles developed in the Eu-  ropean Union in recent years. It includes the most  important aspects of network and information se-  curity, electronic identification, trust services, per-  sonal data protection and many other aspects.  The NCSI web environment is also updated. Now it  is compatible with different devices and provides a  better overview of the countries’ cyber security ca-  pacities. We have developed different comparison  tools that help to analyse the current situation of  countries and place it into regional or global con-  text.  I would like to thank everyone, who contributed to  the development of this index – all state officials,  organisations, companies and individual experts  around the world. My special thanks go to the NCSI  core team members Agu Kivimägi and Marit Lani,  who have made significant effort to develop ver-  sion 2.0 and ensure the quality of the data. Also, I  would like to thank Kala Ruudus Ltd. and especial- ly Rene Saare, who developed the new website for  the index.  Methodology  Purpose  The National Cyber Security Index is a global index,  which measures the preparedness of countries to  prevent cyber threats and manage cyber incidents.  The NCSI is also a database with publicly available  evidence materials and a tool for national cyber se-  curity capacity building.  NCSI Development Process  The index has been developed in 5 steps: 1) Identification of fundamental cyber threats at  the national level  2) Identification of national level cyber security  measures and capacities 3) Selection of important and measurable aspects 4) Development of cyber security indicators  5) Grouping of cyber security indicators  Focus and scope  The NCSI focuses on measurable aspects of cyber  security implemented by the central government: 1)  Legislation in force – legal acts, regulations,  official orders, etc. 2) Established units – existing organisations,  departments, etc. 3) Cooperation formats – council, committee,  official working group, etc. 4) Outcomes / Products – policies, exercises,  technologies, websites, programmes, etc.  Structure  The NCSI has 3 categories, 12 capacities and 46  indicators.  National Cyber Security Index  Cyber security  database  Evidence based  global index  Capacity building  checklist  Identification of capacities and measures  Selection of measura le aspects  Development of indicators  rouping of indicators  Identification of main c er t reats1  2  3  4  5  Measurable Aspects of Cyber Security  LEGISLATION  IN FORCE  Implemented by the central government  ESTABLISHED  UNITS  OUTCOMES / PRODUCTS  COOPERATION  FORMATS  4 capacities | 16 indicators  4 capacities | 14 indicators  4 capacities | 16 indicators  8  Values of indicators  Each indicator has a value, which shows the relative  importance of the indicator in the index. The values  are given by the expert group according to the fol- lowing consideration: 1 point – a legal act that regulates a specific area 2–3 points – a unit that has a specific cyber security  responsibility 2 points – an official cooperation format 1–3 points – an outcome / product (document, ex-  ercise, technology, etc.)  Evidence  Country ratings are based on public evidence: 1) Legal acts  2) Official documents 3) Official websites  NCSI Score  The NCSI Score shows the percentage the coun-  try received  from the maximum  value of the in-  dicators. The maximum  NCSI Score is always 100  (100%) regardless of whether indicators are added  or removed.  Digital Development Level (DDL)  In addition to the NCSI Score, the index table also  shows the Digital Development Level (DDL). The  DDL is calculated according to the ICT Development  Index (IDI) and Networked Readiness Index (NRI).  The DDL is the average percentage the country re-  ceived from the maximum value of both indices.  Difference  The Difference shows the relationship between the  NCSI Score and DDL. A positive result shows that the  country’s cyber security development is in accordance  with, or ahead of, its digital development. A negative  result shows, that the country’s digital society is more  advanced than the national cyber security area.  The NCSI Score shows  the percentage of the  maximum points  NCSI Score  =  Country Points X 100  Maximum Points  The DDL shows the  average % of the IDI  and NRI max values  DDL  =  IDI % + NRI %  2  The Difference shows  the relationship  between NCSI and DDL  Difference  =  NCSI Score  DD  Established unit  O cial cooperation format  Outcomes / Products  egal act Point  Points  Points  Points  1  2  2  3  3  1  Evidence  Legal  acts  O cial  documents  O cial  e sites  Ranking  Rank Country National Cyber Security  Index Digital Development  Level Difference  1.

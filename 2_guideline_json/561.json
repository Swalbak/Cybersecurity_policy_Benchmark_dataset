Given its positioning, ENISA is active in the area of education and awareness, using its knowledge to  promote NIS skills and supporting the Commission in enhancing the skills and competence of  professionals in this area. This document continues work from previous activities by suggesting  training materials, scenarios and a way forward for implementing the EC roadmap for NIS education  in Europe (1). In doing so, the Agency has recognised the heterogeneous landscape of Europe in this  area.  This work was done in collaboration with educators for educators. The primary targets of this report  are professors and trainers that have daily activities in NIS education. The secondary target of this  report is policy-makers in the field of NIS education, those that make the decision on what enters the  curricula and which new courses are adopted.  The report is structured in three parts. The first part maps the courses and materials available. The  second part presents the gaps between existing training/certification schemes and market needs,  including proposals of scenarios to narrow the existing gaps. Finally, a list of recommendations is  presented for further steps and an open call from ENISA is available (2) in order to identify leading  organisations best positioned to further work on the implementation:   the authors suggest the creation of a Europass for NIS skills for the general public, very much  in line with the model from CEDEFOP(3);   Deploying better continuing education programmes for teachers for enhancing the multiplier  role they have. Solutions offered in scenario “Continuing Education for teachers”.    European organisations and authorities should start developing NIS MOOCs. Section on  MOOCs with examples.    Developing a NIS course for health practitioners. Examples accessible in “Healthcare  scenario”.   Developing a Data Protection Officers (DPOs) course directed at lawyers and digital security  specialists. Structure presented in “Data Protection Officers scenario”.   Development of an EU information assurance training/education solution for the working  realities of SMEs. Presented in “Small and Medium Enterprises scenario”.   Development of an EU-based academic recognition for continuing professional development  in digital forensics. Solutions accessible in “Digital Forensics scenario”.

ENISA has started the consultation process in order to involve the relevant stakeholders and guide the  process in order to ensure quality results and the publication of a report. This report introduces the  roadmap and its first steps that describe the certification ecosystem, relevant policies, stakeholders  involved, and the gaps that need to be addressed with innovative solutions.  ENISA is well positioned to respond to the challenge, taking into consideration the brokerage that it  has been achieving in the NIS environment in general and in NIS in Education in particular with the  publication of annual reports (7) in these areas.  The process followed for preparing this current report included a research phase, a large consultation  effort in order to involve all relevant stakeholders, and drafting the final document. The process is  depicted in the image below:  1.1 Policy context and the perspective of this work  As mentioned in the introduction, the EU Cyber Security Strategy “An Open, Safe and Secure  Cyberspace” suggests the development of a roadmap for Network and Information Security, as a  voluntary certification programme to promote enhanced skills and competence of professionals. As  we describe in this document, we are supporting this objective of the EU Cyber Security Strategy, by  proposing an NIS /cybersecurity pass.  Furthermore, the EU Cyber Security Strategy acknowledges that cybersecurity can only be sound and  effective if it is based on fundamental rights and freedoms. Any information sharing for the purposes  (6) http://ec.europa.eu/information_society/newsroom/cf/dae/document.cfm?doc_id=1667  (7) NIS in Education reports http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/stakeholder-relations/nis-brokerage-1/brokerage-model-for-  network-and-information-security-in-education  http://ec.europa.eu/information_society/newsroom/cf/dae/document.cfm?doc_id=1667 http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/stakeholder-relations/nis-brokerage-1/brokerage-model-for-network-and-information-security-in-education http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/stakeholder-relations/nis-brokerage-1/brokerage-model-for-network-and-information-security-in-education  Roadmap for NIS education programmes in Europe  Education  October 2014  Page  2  of cyber security, when personal data is at stake, should be compliant with EU data protection law (8)  and take full account of the individuals' rights in this field.  The Strategy also acknowledges the need for a: “voluntary certification programme to promote  enhanced skills and competence of IT professionals (e.g. website administrators)”, “training on NIS in  schools”, “training on NIS and secure software development and personal data protection for  computer science students” and “NIS basic training for staff working in public administrations”.  As such, our document has a broader perspective, from a general level of information security  knowledge for training in schools, basic knowledge to public administration personal – that needs to  understand security and data protection requirements –, up to specialized knowledge addressed to IT  professionals – responsible for managing, designing or developing secure IT systems and applications  that comply with data protection requirements.  1.2 Objectives  The main goals of this work are to define the roadmap and introduce steps that can be implemented  in order to be in line with best practice in NIS education.  The objectives of the roadmap are:  1. Provide an initial market analysis of the courses and certification schemes available.  2. Identify gaps between available training courses, certifications and NIS education needs.  3.  Suggest scenarios to narrow the gaps and provide best practices to organizations from all  Member States.  4. Plan further actions based on the needs of NIS communities.  5. Identify and select partners to continue and disseminate the work.  Regarding potential strategies to exchange best practices, ENISA will use its existing NIS education  communities to disseminate the work. e.g. the ECSM (European Cyber Security Month) community,  the NIS in Education group, partner universities, etc.  Representatives of NIS organisations that will show interest in this report and that want to contribute  should check the suitability of the proposed scenarios and suggest a way forward for implementation.  1.3 Target audience  This work has been prepared in collaboration with educators for educators. Professors and trainers  that have daily activities in NIS education represent the primary target. The secondary target is  represented by policy-makers in the field of NIS education, those that make the decision on what  enters the curricula and which new courses are adopted.  Note that this report tackles not only IT administrators but a larger audience, including training and  education solutions as already mentioned in the section dedicated to the perspective of this work.

We identified the topics of the scenarios by taking into account objectives of policy strategies, the  policy context and provisions, the experience of the experts group, and the advice of the European  Commission. For the purpose of this report we used desktop research and large consultation with  representatives of different organisations part of the consultative group. We formed the consultative  group as a result of a public announcement of this project.  In addition, the report benefits from the existence of some extra material:  1. A useful tool is the interactive map with NIS courses in Europe available on  www.cybersecuritymonth.eu compiled with the help of by the NIS Platform WG3 group.  2. A NIS quiz addressed to all users for updating knowledge available on  www.cybersecuritymonth.eu.  http://www.cybersecuritymonth.eu/ http://www.cybersecuritymonth.eu/  Roadmap for NIS education programmes in Europe  Education  October 2014  Page  4  2 Mapping the available courses and materials  This part of the study provides the reader with an overview of existing education materials, curricula  and courses. Furthermore, as the intention of this work is to provide way forward to address the  existing gaps, in this part we provide some scenarios to address existing needs, such as the lack of  proper data protection education for NIS professionals or for personal data processors.  2.1 Initiatives to gather information on existing certification and training  programmes  2.1.1 Cyber Security Month programmes database  In the context of the European Cyber Security Month initiative, a database has been established where  available courses and certification programmes linked to NIS and privacy/data protection are listed.  This database of available courses and certifications programmes is not an exhaustive list.  The data  presented has come from work produced by the NIS Platform WG 3 members, whom we thank for  their collaboration. Furthermore, the webpage allows educational institutions to add to the map  courses, programmes and training that deal with Network and Information Security. We invite the  reader to access the web address9.  2.1.2 Privacy and security related educational information and reference material  PReparing Industry for Privacy by design by supporting its Application in REsearch (PRIPARE) (10)  PRIPARE is a two-year FP7 support action (11) aimed at identifying and developing processes and tools  capable of facilitating the widespread application of a Privacy and Security by Design methodology.  Recognizing the essential role of stakeholders’ information and education about the risks, tools, best  practices, rights, and responsibilities associated with digital security and privacy, PRIPARE provides  educational information and reference material for the following set of stakeholders: general public,  ICT educators, ICT practitioners, policy-makers, and governmental and non-governmental bodies  acting for human rights protection. After a detailed analysis of stakeholder groups, their knowledge  needs were identified ( 12 ) and project partners are currently producing and testing educational,  information and reference material addressing these needs. Once validated, this material will be made  available online (13) in modular format.  Stakeholder analysis for PRIPARE support action. Sub-groups of stakeholders within the large  categories mentioned above have been identified and, for each one of these sub-groups, their  informational/educational needs have been defined in terms of the learning outcomes that the  educational material produced within the project should trigger. The general public was analysed on  the basis of their level of vulnerability. Practitioners were considered in terms of their professional  role, either managerial or development. The study of students’ needs was based on the type of their  degree (technical versus non-technical), the level of study (graduate, undergraduate), and career  goals. Regarding policy and legal stakeholders, we have identified policy-makers and governmental  bodies acting at different geographical levels (national, European, international) as well as non- governmental bodies, including NGOs, think tanks, civil society organisations, and legal professionals.

The modules being produced respond to  the knowledge needs identified in the stakeholder analysis phase, address privacy risks (c1-c5) and  focus on privacy rights (e.g. OECD Privacy Guidelines, EU Data Protection Directive, EU ePrivacy  Directive, etc.). Each module is implemented in the format best suited for communication of the  specific content to the specific stakeholder group, ranging from standard slide presentations to  crossword puzzles, from videos to infographics, from exercise series to structured references to  academic literature, etc. Sets of modules can be compiled to create curricular structures, workshop  material, individual lectures, awareness campaigns, etc. The complete list of modules is described in  the PRIPARE deliverable 4.114. Below are a few examples of modules for two of the stakeholders  groups: the general public and the engineering practitioners.  Modules for the general public aim to raise awareness about Privacy by Design (PbD), the dangers of  privacy violations and users’ rights; they also explain the actions users may take in case of privacy  infringement. They cover PbD in specific contexts, the tools for privacy protection, and methodologies  for risk management. Modules for practitioners introduce PbD principles and concepts; themes  include privacy context (the legal context as a source of privacy requirements for a software  development process), risk management (what it is and its benefits for a software development  process, privacy impact assessment as a risk management methodology applied to PbD), best  practices (e.g. privacy patterns), technologies and solutions for privacy protection, and finally, the  testing and validating of the outcomes of the PbD process. Other specific knowledge modules for  engineering practitioners cover privacy patterns, privacy failures, Privacy Design Strategies, location  privacy, anonymous cash, etc.  Modules Assessment in PRIPARE support action. Assessment work includes initiatives such as a  seminar providing training on Privacy by Design to members from academia, EU research projects, and  industry with a focus on technology (15), a round table with DPAs (i), and university courses. In a course  designed by members of the PRIPARE consortium (16), it demonstrates how Privacy by Design may be  effectively taught to a combined group of undergraduate and graduate students in the social sciences  whose knowledge of technology is limited to their own user experience. The curriculum explores a  new educational space at the theoretical intersection of human rights and digital technology while  integrating a practical component that allows students to produce educational materials for  stakeholder audiences; this merging of theory and practice provides our students with the opportunity  to reflect on the convergence of law and technology. The curriculum incorporates Ann Cavoukian’s  set of seven guiding principles (17) as core learning objectives and uses the principles in contexts that  are not limited to Privacy by Design, showing how they can effectively be applied to other contexts at  the interface of human rights and digital technology. Each of Cavoukian’s seven principles is addressed  through the lens of a case study, with issues selected on the basis of their cross-cutting impact.  Regardless of whether the high level of user mistrust concerning privacy protection of digital  information is justified, international human rights law and the robust Data Protection Regulation  proposed by the European Commission require protection of online privacy. Educational materials for  various types of stakeholders were produced in interaction with students. The focus is on the practical  problem of how to best implement the right to privacy on a day-to-day basis. Providing an already  mistrustful population with privacy-enhancing knowledge and tools is a seminal example of the mis  en oeuvre of participatory action research methods.

Only by privileging the broader perspective can we deliver on the promise of digital technology to  enhance democratic dialogue and facilitate human lifestyles, and make sure that it is safe to use for  the generations to come.  Expected Uses of the Material and Outcomes of PRIPARE support action. The Consortium of the  project hopes that the information-educational material produced by the project will facilitate the  dissemination and application of Privacy by Design principles and methodology. On one hand, the  modules will increase stakeholders’ familiarity with their privacy-related rights and responsibilities  and with the current and potential technical solutions aimed at supporting the effective  implementation of such rights and responsibilities. On the other hand, the modules will promote a  mature reflection on the impact of privacy choices (both technical and regulatory) on societal  structures such as businesses, industry, education, healthcare, transportation, etc. Overall, the  educational material will disseminate the results and support the vision of the PRIPARE project to help  ‘forge sustainable links between the different privacy stakeholders (regulators, educators, engineers  and standardisation organisms) in order to set the necessary common grounds on which to build  trustworthy and privacy-respectful systems’ (18).  2.2 NIS programmes for school education: an overview  School education is one factor used to reach the goal of helping minors to use the Internet in a ‘safe’  way and is widely perceived as an important component for improving cybersecurity (19). Reflecting on  this perceived importance, a multitude of materials and associated activities such as training events  and certification are being offered to teachers on the Web. The materials that we surveyed do not  refer to a common theoretical or even terminological base (20). Therefore, we begin this section by  proposing a structure on the basic concepts that will allow us to then overview and relate materials  to one another. Based on this overview, we will make a proposal for a more comprehensive training  programme in the scenario of Section 3.1.4.  THE BASIC CONCEPTS: CYBER RISKS AND SAFETY  In line with the well-known observation that doom scenarios do not have educational effects, the  Internet/Web is introduced as a space full of opportunities but also of risks. In the following, we will  call these cyber risks. The goal of the educational intervention is to turn this situation into a safe (or  safer) space (21): thus, safety is implicitly defined to be a state in which these risks are mitigated. (As in  other spaces with risk, a complete elimination is probably not possible, although this is not discussed  explicitly.) The focus is on threats to the individual (here: the minor, the pupil) and on precautions that  the individuals themselves can take to mitigate the risks. The effects that one person’s privacy-related  behaviour has on others mostly remain implicit: the Internet will be safer/better for all if all exhibit  safe behaviour. Thus, cyber risks, the state in which they are mitigated and safety are conceived of  similarly to, for example, road traffic.

(2014) observe that most materials are not based on any theory and that only very few have been  evaluated. Vanderhoven, E., Schellens, T., & Valcke, M. (2014). Educational packages about the risks on social network sites:  state of  the art. Procedia — Social and Behavioural Sciences, 112, 603-612.  (21) An example is the activities around the annual ‘Safer Internet Day’; see below.  Roadmap for NIS education programmes in Europe  Education  October 2014  Page  7  A TAXONOMY OF CYBER RISKS  The cyber risks typically discussed comprise (a) the risk of encountering inappropriate material which  may comprise disturbing materials (violence, sexual content) or materials that can easily be  misinterpreted especially by minors (false information, satire, etc.); (b) the risk of committing a  criminal or otherwise sanctioned act oneself (copyright violations, plagiarism); and, increasingly, (c) a  range of cybersecurity issues that typically involve violations of the pupil’s own personal sphere or  that of his/her friends (22). We use cybersecurity in the sense of ‘the state of being protected from the  criminal, unauthorised or otherwise undesired use of data, computer hardware or software’ (23) and  the notion that ‘security’ is a form of ‘safety’ that focuses on being protected against external  threats (24). We do not regard (a) or (b) as cybersecurity issues because their focus is not on a personal  sphere or a computational environment being intruded upon. However, it should be noted that the  categories are not mutually exclusive. For example, pupil A may utter ‘hate speech’ (category b or  verging on it) that deeply troubles pupil B (category a). Also, if pupil A cyberbullies pupil B, this may  be both criminal and invasive of B’s personal sphere (and damaging to A too). Within such a mixed set  of problems, we will focus on their contribution to category (c) risks.  A TAXONOMY OF CYBERSECURITY RISKS  In the remainder of this section and in line with this report focus, we will concentrate on category (c),  the cybersecurity issues deemed relevant for the school education of minors. The criterion of dividing  (c) into sub-categories reflects the origin of the type of risk under consideration.  (c.1) Contact risks (25): abuses of data that identifies an individual  These risks comprise third parties (other people) communicating with the individual in undesired and  often unexpected ways. Examples include cyberbullying and grooming ( 26 ). Such risks may be  intensified by the frequency with which minors interact with strangers online (27). In general, a main  reason leading to these risks is the abuse of identifying personal data given away voluntarily by the  individual.  (c.2) Invisible audiences and context collapse (28) unintended/inappropriate audiences for data that  profile an individual  (22) This top-level taxonomy is inspired by De Moor et al. (2008), reused by Vanderhoven et al. (2014).  (23) This combines the definition from the Oxford English Dictionary (‘The state of being protected against the criminal or unauthorized  use of electronic data, or the measures taken to achieve this’, http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/cybersecurity)  and whatis.com (‘Cybersecurity is the body of technologies, processes and practices designed to protect networks, computers,  programs and data from attack, damage or unauthorized access. […]’. http://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/cybersecurity) Other  definitions are broader still, highlighting only the protection aspect without detailing what to protect against, for example  the  definition by the International Telecommunication Union: ‘Cyber security is the collection of tools, policies, security concepts, security  safeguards, guidelines, risk management approaches, actions, training, best practices, assurance and technologies that can be  used  to protect the cyber environment and organization and user’s assets. Organisation and user’s assets include connected computing  devices, personnel, infrastructure, applications, services, telecommunications systems, and the totality of transmitted and/or stored  information in the cyber environment.’ Definitions focusing on ‘unauthorised’ uses assume fully rational decision-makers. However,  since privacy and security violations often occur after consent has been given only implicitly, or even after informed consent, we  added ‘or otherwise undesired’.

Among other things, this may involve ‘the wrong  people getting a piece of information, maybe in the future’. In educational materials, this is usually  projected to a few socially stereotyped behaviours and their assumed consequences: alcohol, (near-)  nudity, and swearing are portrayed as ‘risky information’ (and thus, implicitly, their opposites as ‘safe’)  with regard to impressions made on teachers, peers, and potential future employers (e.g. Moreno et  al., 2009 ( 29 ); Vanderhoven et al., 2013 ( 30 )). The main reason leading to these risks is the  decontextualised use, generally by peers or other people, of communication and profiling personal  data given away voluntarily by the individual. A twofold strategy is recommended against these risks:  (a) to use access control options (‘privacy settings’) judiciously when sharing any information and (b)  to not share ‘risky information’ at all over social media, since even with carefully selected audiences,  future (ab)uses cannot be predicted or prevented.  While this approach can be helpful, it is also problematic because of its often only implicit ethical  judgements and the assumption of stable and predictable categories of ‘risky information’. This may  lead to the illusion that by simply not sharing this type of information (but sharing everything else),  one can be ‘safe’. The learning objective should not only be to avoid these risks, but also to appreciate  and apply data minimisation as a general principle, to be aware that there can never be full certainty,  and to use technology with a critical and informed perspective.  (c.3) Context collapse II: repurposing of data for commercial and other ends  Common notions of ‘digital literacy’ as a learning goal focus on knowledge and skills related to content  risks and security risks (c.1) and (c.2). Other types of risks are currently covered less.  Some authors writing about school education analyse undesired uses of personal data by commercial  entities (e.g. De Moor et al., 2008; Vanderhoven et al., 2014). These include the commercial misuse of  personal data. Information can be shared with third companies via applications and user behaviour  can be tracked in order to provide targeted advertisements and social advertisements (31). In addition  to causing annoyance, profiling may also lead to discrimination in access to services, jobs, etc. A main  reason leading to these risks is the decontextualised and repurposed use, by commercial entities, of  personal data given away voluntarily by the individual.  (c.4) IT security risks include malware, phishing, pharming, or hacking. Some authors present  empirical findings showing poor dealings with passwords among minors (sharing passwords with  others, infrequently or never changing passwords, poor knowledge of what a strong password is (32).  Reasons leading to these risks are the exploitation, by others, of weaknesses in computer software,  hardware, and human naivety.  (c.5) Cybersecurity conflicts of interest in the fabric of society and democracy  The categories described so far (and most teaching materials) implicitly assume that safety, security  and privacy are well-defined and generally agreed-upon values. However, as the privacy literature and  current public debates show, this is not the case. Regarding protections against intrusions by peers  (the main topic of categories (c.1) and (c.2), culture and education may work towards shared values  of respect for other’s spaces. However, this is less straightforward with regard to the relationships to  (29) Moreno, M. A., Vanderstoep, A., Parks, M. R., Zimmerman, F. J., Kurth, A., & Christakis, D. A. (2009).

(32) Sharples et al. (2009), see above.  Roadmap for NIS education programmes in Europe  Education  October 2014  Page  9  institutions (commercial entities as in category (c.3) or government entities). Individuals’ and groups’  rights to privacy vis-à-vis institutions may be legally protected, for example via data protection laws  or fundamental rights such as informational self-determination (Germany) or the Fourth Amendment  (U.S.A)33. However, other interests and rights held by the individual and/or others may conflict with  these rights. These other interests and rights include contract freedom and the business model of  financing a not-for-payment service by exploiting personal data, criminal investigations, or national  security (for a critical discussion, see Solove, 2011 (34)). Yet other rights such as freedom of speech are  intimately tied up with privacy and security rights.  In other words, privacy and security are essential (and non-trivial) components of democracy and thus  a necessary component of school education beyond informatics and also beyond the notion of digital  literacy explained above. It is important to note that in this area of NIS education, the diversity of  Europeans must be respected. Specifically, the nested  identities of Europeans — as citizens of Europe  but also of their respective country and maybe even region — implies that national laws and culture- specific histories and concepts, in particular of privacy, must be a focus of teaching in addition to pan- European or even global content.  This would reflect the cultural diversity in the EU and the  determining impact it has on education. Such diversity can occur at different levels.  Factors include national (or even personal) histories of regimes with intensive surveillance, such as in  Germany or former communist states of Eastern and Central Europe, and likewise the histories of  media coverage of and civic engagement against surveillance. School curricula themselves are a  determining factor: is computer science being taught at all? (While it is well-entrenched in some  European countries, it barely exists in others.) How much time can be allocated to a novel and cross- disciplinary content such as privacy/security education?(35). Finally, \"cultural variables\" such as the  relative focus on individualism vs. collectivism may affect the extent of learners' initiative and learning  behaviour and therefore choices of didactic methods36.  AN OVERVIEW OF MATERIALS AND TRAINING EVENTS  In the following paragraphs, we give an exemplary overview of materials and training events, with a  specific focus on European-level resources, and highlight their respective foci on selected categories  of cyber risks/ cybersecurity risks. We also outline possible ways forward.  Basic requirements: ENISA has identified key points and success factors for teaching security in  schools in the 2012 report ‘Collaborative Solutions for Network Information Security in Education’ (37).  The report also contains descriptions and pointers to selected school projects, e.g. on the separation  of digital identities (regarding risk category c.2). Key findings from the report are offered as  downloadable posters that can be used for dissemination (38).  (33) The right to informational self-determination was formulated in the German Federal Constitutional Court ruling on the Census of 1983:  \"[...] in the context of modern data processing, the protection of the individual against unlimited collection, storage, use and disclosure of  his/her personal data is encompassed by the general personal rights of the German constitution. This basic right warrants in this respect the  capacity of the individual to determine in principle the disclosure and use of his/her personal data. Limitations to this informational self- determination are allowed only in case of overriding public interest.\" This ruling has strongly influenced subsequent German and European  data protection legislation. The Fourth Amendment of the US Constitution is \"the right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses,  papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause,  supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.\" Surveillance  and other privacy invasions are often regarded as breaches of the Fourth Amendment (e.g. Slobogin, C. (2008). Privacy at Risk: The New  Government Surveillance and the Fourth Amendment. Chicago, IL: University of Chicago Press).  (34) Solove, D. (2011). Nothing to hide.

This is a computer literacy certification with several  modules, one of which is IT Security (39), i.e. our category (c.4). Its focus lies on ‘the secure use of ICT  in daily life’ and on ‘managing data and information appropriately’.  ECDL/ICDL also recommends its certification for teachers, emphasizing the advantages of using ICT for  teaching (e.g. creation of online content) and related and administrative tasks (e.g. online  communication with students and parents, management of student data) (40).  Certification (accreditation) for institutions is discussed as a sub-point of European Schoolnet  activities, to be discussed next.  European Schoolnet, a network of 31 European Ministries of Education, offers teaching materials and  infrastructure for teacher collaboration, resources directly addressing pupils, activities and  frameworks for pupil-/teacher-led activities, and a first step towards certification for schools as  institutions:   The materials collection Insafe in the Learning Resources Exchange: close to 300 resources on  topics such as digital literacy, cyberbullying, safe searching, or privacy and personal information,  with a focus on categories (a), (c.1), and (c.2) (41). Resource types vary, including lesson series  descriptions and detailed materials, games, and interactive websites. Other materials have been  created by the National Safer Internet Centres (42). Their foci resemble those of Insafe materials.   Infrastructure: the European networking platform (43) for teachers.   Activities framework: the annual Safer Internet Day (44)   Institutional accreditation: ‘The eSafety Label offers an Assessment Form covering the broad  range of actors who can impact, within and beyond the school walls, the level of eSafety of an  educational institution. Based on a school’s results, an Action Plan is drawn up to increase the  level of eSafety, which might lead the way towards eSafety Label Accreditation […] (45). Sample  questions indicate that the notion of ‘eSafety’ used covers (at least) selected aspects of IT security  (c.4) such as protection against malware, and of privacy, such as having a school policy about  taking photographs of and by pupils (c.2).   Incentive schemes: ENISA and European Schoolnet created an award for ‘Teaching online safety  and citizenship’ in schools (46) with the 2010 winner project focusing on contact risks (category c.1  above) and online games.  Teaching materials and training events on IT security: e-skills UK, the United Kingdom’s sector skills  council for the IT industry, offers teaching resources with a view to attracting pupils to cybersecurity  careers. It offers various basic 20-30 minute modules on issues and methods mostly of category (c.4)  such as phishing, hacking, digital forensics, and cross-curricular resources ( 47 ).

Similar  initiatives, especially hackathons etc. focusing on spotting pupils with cybersecurity talents, are now  emerging across Europe (for example, see the presentations at the 2014 ENISA Workshop on Cyber  Security Issues in Europe (49).  Teaching materials and training events about the economic and democratic issues of privacy and  security: In spite of the growing perception of the importance of these issues (for example, see the  sections on tracking and the monetisation of personal data in the 2012 ENISA report) and the presence  of good work in the privacy literature, this is hardly covered in today’s teaching materials. Exceptions  include materials and lesson plans developed in the context of the interdisciplinary SPION (‘Security  and Privacy in Online Social Networks’) project: from the short treatments of economic risks in the  privacy manual (50), via its extension and evaluation in Vanderhoven et al (51)., to the lesson series ‘If  you’re not paying for it, you’re the product’ (52) that explores the cybersecurity risk categories (c.3)  and (c.5) in detail and in their interrelationship, and the teacher training workshop based on it (53).  Additional teaching forms: ISC2 (International Information Systems Security Certification  Consortium), a membership body of certified information and software security professionals that is  best known as a certification body (e.g. CISSP, accredited by ANSI as ISO Standard 17024:2003), offers  one-hour presentation visits of volunteer security practitioners at schools (54). Target groups are pupils  aged 7-10 or 11-14 and parents. Judging from the content that is available online, content is a  combination of issues from the categories (c.1), (c.2), and (c.4) (cf. The ‘Safe and Secure Online Top 10  Tips’ (55).  CONCLUSIONS  In summary, this overview shows that:   There is an abundance of materials and programmes for helping European teachers learn about  and teach cybersecurity;   While some cybersecurity risks and remedies are covered well (especially contact risks and  invisible audiences / context collapse, with IT security being well-covered but only partially so for  school purposes), others are touched on rarely (commercial risks such as the repurposing of  personal data) or very rarely (privacy, security, and democracy);   The non-uniform use of terms such as ‘safety’ and ‘security’ and various derivatives of these  words, and the lack of definitions or theoretical underpinnings, may make it difficult for teachers  to perceive, explore, and teach the field in a structured fashion. The risk is that lesson plans  become a rather arbitrary collection of ‘do’s and don’ts’ that seem unrelated and do not support  deep learning, reflection, and transfer skills.  In the scenario described in Section 3.1.4, we will propose a way to improve on this situation.

A current trend in education is the emergence of MOOCs – Massive Online Open  Courses (56). MOOCs are a new way of delivering online education and cater for a wide audience,  although there is debate on this.  MOOCs are currently being used also to deliver NIS education,  however the current status of MOOCs in this specific area is quite fragmented. In this section we  provide an initial overview on the status of NIS MOOCs, also focusing on two key relevant aspects: a  MOOC on the subject of Cybersecurity funded and supported by the UK Government as part of its  Cybersecurity policy and a MOOCs platform launched by the EU Commission which can offer relevant  opportunities within the EU context. Courses resemble university courses in terms of content and  breadth, but the delivery model, assessment and peer collaboration is different from traditional  university courses. MOOCs are delivered via tailored online platforms. In most cases they are free and  open to access, but the platforms could be both commercial and non-commercial. They are often  delivered by elite universities from Europe and the U.S. and hence there is the promise for top level  education for a wider audience. However, MOOCs have so far seen a high level of enrolment coupled  with a low level of completion ( 57 ). However, it needs to be noted that, according to some  commentators, the completion rate should not be considered as the key metric for MOOCs viability,  and other benefits come from access to high quality material, peer collaboration, and learning  experiences (58). Data also shows that students completing MOOCs often already possess bachelor  degrees (59). This could be a relevant aspect to consider when the audience for this project module is  mainly composed of IT professionals or teachers (i.e. professionals already possessing bachelor  degrees) that would seek to obtain further training in specialised areas (e.g. NIS), via a MOOC module.  MOOCs could hence constitute an interesting avenue for NIS education and a way of delivering NIS  Education modules to large audiences. This is an approach that can be potentially embraced by  interested stakeholders. In particular, there are two aspects in this perspective that could contribute  to the interests in MOOCs. Firstly, among Member States for instance, the UK is actively looking at  MOOCs as part of its Cyber Security Strategy. In a document titled ‘The National Cyber Security  Strategy Our Forward Plans (60)’, there is an indication that the government is investing in MOOCs as  part of its plan to increase NIS training and in particular: ‘the Open University is developing a Massive  Open Online Course (MOOC) on cyber security to be run for the first time by summer 2014. The course  has the potential to reach 200,000 students, including internationally. The MOOC is intended to run  over an eight week period and will be presented four times a year for three years. The goal is to help  raise awareness of cyber security among a mass audience as well as providing a high-quality course  which will make the subject accessible to non-specialist learners and encourage those with an interest  in the subject to study further’. The Open University MOOC on Cyber Security has opened for  registration in September 2014 and lecturing started in October of the same year. In the perspective  of the NIS education roadmap, results of this MOOC (in terms of reached audience, attendance, and  awareness raising) could offer indication for future diverse implementations of NIS modules via MOOC  platforms.  A second relevant aspect to consider is that the EU Commission is also looking at this  delivery model with a focus on using MOOCs to bridge gaps in digital and IT skills. The Commission has  (56) See for an exhaustive review. https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/240193/13-1173-  maturing-of-the-mooc.pdf  (57) See, for instance, completion data from MIT and Stanford. http://www.edtechmagazine.com/higher/article/2014/02/harvardxs-and-  mitxs-mooc-data-visualized-and-mapped  (58) https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/240193/13-1173-maturing-of-the-mooc.pdf  (59) http://theinstitute.ieee.org/ieee-roundup/opinions/ieee-roundup/low-completion-rates-for-moocs  (60)  https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/265386/The_National_Cyber_Security_Strategy_ Our_Forward_Plans_December_2013.pdf  https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/240193/13-1173-maturing-of-the-mooc.pdf https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/240193/13-1173-maturing-of-the-mooc.pdf http://www.edtechmagazine.com/higher/article/2014/02/harvardxs-and-mitxs-mooc-data-visualized-and-mapped http://www.edtechmagazine.com/higher/article/2014/02/harvardxs-and-mitxs-mooc-data-visualized-and-mapped https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/240193/13-1173-maturing-of-the-mooc.pdf http://theinstitute.ieee.org/ieee-roundup/opinions/ieee-roundup/low-completion-rates-for-moocs https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/265386/The_National_Cyber_Security_Strategy_Our_Forward_Plans_December_2013.pdf https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/265386/The_National_Cyber_Security_Strategy_Our_Forward_Plans_December_2013.pdf  Roadmap for NIS education programmes in Europe  Education  October 2014  Page  13  already taken steps for ‘launching a network of providers of MOOCs related to web and apps skills (61).’  European Commission Vice President Neelie Kroes, responsible for the Digital Agenda, said: ‘By 2020,  90 % of jobs will need digital skills. That is just around the corner, and we aren’t ready! Already  businesses in Europe are facing a shortage of skilled ICT workers. We have to fill that gap, and this  network we are launching will help us identify where the gaps are.’ (62) In addition to this, a pan- European MOOC platform ( 63 ) was launched by the Commission, financed through the Lifelong  Learning Programme. This platform now hosts a number of MOOCs, some related to IT skills (e.g.  computer programming, network architecture), but currently no course is directly related to NIS  education.  MAPPING MOOC COURSES  The following is a non-exhaustive list of MOOCs in the area of NIS courses. Few of these are or were  delivered by European universities and institutes with the majority being delivered by U.S. universities.  This might be an aspect to consider in a pan-European perspective and offer a further  recommendation for action with more NIS MOOCs delivered by European entities.

Furthermore, scenarios will be suggested to provide best practices to organizations from  all Member States with the hope that, together with the consultative group, we may plan further  actions based on the needs of NIS communities and identify partners to continue, implement, and  disseminate the work.  3.1 Recommending NIS education scenarios for a pan-European Level  The scenarios were developed by following an agreed-on template with publicly available information  from universities, institutions, and other projects.  The scenarios are put forward for wider debate and dissemination in order to achieve a truly  consultative process. This can be considered as the theoretical part, phase one of the initiative, with  a phase two to follow for implementation by public-private partnerships or single organisations that  have the will and resources to put the scenarios into practice.  The scenarios can be implemented as activities for continuing professional development for  professionals from the respective scenario’s target group(s). We would like to emphasize that these  scenarios should be viewed as frameworks for concrete implementations. For example, concrete  implementations should be adapted to their specific contexts (such as the duration of the course).  Also, these scenarios can, by definition, only portray the area at the time at which this report was  written. Given the rapid developments in the NIS area (in terms of technology, vulnerabilities, user  behaviour and concerns) and also evolving legal frameworks, concrete implementations of the  scenarios should strive to keep materials and course contents up-to-date.  Roadmap for NIS education programmes in Europe  Education  October 2014  Page  15  3.1.1 Continuing Education for Teachers Scenario  Security and Privacy: Continuing Professional Development (CPD) for School Teachers  Summary  According to a 2012 ENISA Report (64), ‘Cyber security is generally in the hands  of specialists who implement technical solutions. Citizens and SMEs (Small and  Medium Enterprises) are left out of this action despite the fact that a thorough  awareness of end users about cyber security is the first line of defence against  cyber threats. As such, these players must be provided with the skills to protect  their devices, their data, and their online identity’.  The Eurobarometer survey on cyber security (65) revealed that ‘Most EU citizens  do not feel very or at all well informed about the risks of cybercrime (59 %)  while 38 % say they are very or fairly well informed. There is a clear link  between being well informed and feeling confident online’. The same survey  also discovered socio-demographic variations, for instance, access to the  Internet or type of crime in which citizens of different ages are victims. Among  other categories of citizens, children and young adults deserve particular  attention. On average, children start using the Internet at the age of 7.  Together with quality content, they need to be provided with appropriate skills  and awareness for ensuring their safety online.  This scenario aims to close the gap identified in the 2012 ENISA report. It  suggests an intervention on a specific target group whose multiplier role  means that having increased capacities in terms of transferable NIS education  skills could have a wide and lasting impact on EU society and its citizens, and  in particular on children and young adults: school teachers.  This target group is interesting not only because of their role as societal  multipliers. Teachers are also a target group specifically interested in  continuing professional development and ‘life-long learning’. With informatics  topics in particular, many school teachers face the challenge that pupils  consider themselves more knowledgeable ‘about computers’, ‘about social  media’, etc. than the teachers. To meet this challenge, it is particularly  important that school teachers display and express well-founded, structured  knowledge and reflection. In addition, a school itself is an environment in  which practical measures can be tested and institutionalised (such as the  responsible dealings with personal data of pupils, teachers, and other  personnel). To the extent that teachers can be agents of change in this way,  they can set examples for effective action orientation.  In sum, we therefore consider developments of training activities for the target  group of school teachers a possible blueprint for life-long learning activities  which can also be used for other citizens.

This mix of  participants is essential for our concept of security/privacy education being an  overarching topic: neither only technical nor only social. Ideally, the courses  will stimulate collaboration between teachers across traditional boundaries of  their subjects.  According to a Eurydice report, ‘education on online safety (OS) is included in  the school curriculum in 24 countries/regions’ ( 66 ), but the EU Kids Online  Report remarks that ‘in many countries, teachers provide little in the way of  safety awareness and training to guide pupils’ Internet use, though the range  and adoption of new initiatives is now spreading.’ (67)  Therefore, school teachers are those IT professionals that can be most  effective as multipliers in today’s society for broad segments of the population  that will, in their own professional training later, not necessarily themselves  receive privacy/security training but whose actions will determine  privacy/security outcomes: i.e. those pupils who will not become IT  professionals themselves or who will become IT professionals but will only  have a narrow technological focus in their professional context experience.  Main  stakeholders  involved   ECDL Foundation   ISC   SANS   European Schoolnet, eTwinning   National and regional teacher (training) associations  Current status See Section 2.3.  Recommendations for Implementation  Objective: to reduce the gap between the need for NIS security skills in the wider EU society with a  direct intervention on a key target group — school teachers. School teachers are those IT  professionals that can be most effective as multipliers in today’s society for broad segments of the  population. This objective can be achieved by developing appropriate NIS education training  modules targeted at teachers’ needs and competences. We outline how these could be based on  existing modules.  Implementation aspects:   Duration and other factors of context adaptation: The duration of the course could differ  from a standard smaller-scale professional development course spanning one or two full  days to a more in-depth extension of qualification involving weekly meetings of 2-3 hours  over a year or more. The requirements for duration of teacher CPD activities as well as the  incentives given to teachers in the form of recognition for their job requirements, vary  across European countries. We recommend an exploratory questionnaire concerning the  breadth and depth of such a training among the target group in order to determine an  (66) http://eacea.ec.europa.eu/education/eurydice/documents/thematic_reports/121EN.pdf  (67) Livingstone, S, and Haddon, L (2009).

Context adaptation should also take into account the participants’  local legal and cultural context as explained in Section 2.3 of this report.   Continuing Professional Development: Within a teacher’s career, this can be a one-time CPD  activity. This would most likely be the model if the course is of short duration. If the course  is a longer-term qualification and, resources permitting (see ‘basic structure’), it should be  made possible for participants to update their knowledge by re-taking updated individual  modules. In addition, other interested persons can use the online materials.   Specific properties of this course, added value compared to existing offers: As detailed in  Section 2.3, there are a multitude of offers on regional, national and European levels of  materials, lesson plans, etc. for teachers of primary and secondary education on various  notions of ‘(e)safety’, ‘security’, ‘privacy’, etc. However, in spite of individual topics being  covered well, the underlying notion(s) of these terms are often not explained, ethical  assumptions are not questioned and often remain implicit, action orientation remains  limited, and possible conflicts between different notions of ‘security’ (etc.) are neither  identified nor discussed. This leads to fragmented knowledge and skills that are ill-suited to  developing, let alone teaching, comprehensive security knowledge and skills. An additional  shortcoming is that the privacy practices of teachers and schools are rarely discussed,  although these are required for teachers to set a credible example. This course addresses  this challenge by (1) devoting a full module to clarifying and discussing the different notions  of ‘security’ and related terms; (2) including modules on each of these notions; and (3) in  each module, and specifically in the additional module 6 on collaboration and continuing  learning, also addressing teachers’ own practices and possibilities for improving them.  These modules can reuse materials from the existing stock; cf. the mapping between  materials and risk types provided in Section 2.3 and used in the module descriptions.   Training and training the trainers: All modules should help teachers in their own  qualifications but also be a basis for their educational activities. Therefore, participants  should be given ample opportunity to discuss their own teaching practice and to receive  concrete ideas (case studies) as well as concrete materials that they can use or even full  lesson series. Many such examples are included in the overview in Section 2.3.  Curriculum proposal: basic structure: The curriculum consists of six modules. Resources permitting,  modules could be updated and revised in version numbers. Materials of previous instantiations of  the course are made available online.   Module 1: Different notions of ‘security’: safety, e-safety, security, cybersecurity, security  and privacy, IT security and national security, ‘good and bad hackers’, etc.: untangling a  conceptual mess and the inherent as well as the illusory conflicts and trade-offs between  the different notions  o This presents an overview and synopsis of the issues dealt with in modules 2-6, and  invites participants’ reflection and critical discussion of the course structure.   Module 2: ‘Security’ in the sense of ‘protection against inappropriate content and  undesired audiences and contacts’ with a special focus on problems affecting children and  teenagers  o This module focuses on cyber(security) risk types and ‘content risks’ (c.1) and (c.2).  Course participants learn about problems that affect children and adolescents in  particular but not only them (e.g. posting to ‘inappropriate audiences’ and/or sharing  Roadmap for NIS education programmes in Europe  Education  October 2014  Page  18  ‘inappropriate content’). Thus, the learning goal is also digital literacy for adults,  including a reflection on (and possibly change of) one’s own behaviours.  o Recommended specific topics in this module include: content risks, safe searching,  contact risks (cyberbullying, grooming, etc.), and audience management (privacy  settings).   Module 3: ‘Security’ in the sense of ‘protection of personal data and privacy ’  o This module focuses on cybersecurity risk type (c.3). Participants receive a  comprehensive overview of privacy and data protection issues. Technical,  computational, legal, and social aspects are covered with a special focus on helping  participants develop lesson plans tailored to their subject and time constraints.  o Recommended specific topics in this module include: basics of data-based web  business models, interest conflicts between companies and users, tracking and anti- tracking tools and PETs, basics of data mining tasks and methods, data protection  legislation, and practice.   Module 4: ‘Security’ in the sense of ‘IT Security’  o This module focuses on cybersecurity risk type (c.4). Participants learn theoretical  foundations and practical skills. The goal is twofold: first, to learn (and be able to teach)  protection measures for daily life; second, to help course participants create a secure  IT environment at their schools which may include technical as well as social  institutional arrangements. The module also deals with appropriate ways for pupils to  participate in these measures. This module is key in that it shows to pupils, teachers,  and school management that security is not something the individual can achieve  alone. Joint efforts that can lead to ‘security accreditation’ for the school as an  institution are described (68).  o Recommended specific topics in this module include: basic safety measures such as  dealing with passwords, communications and encryption, malware, social engineering  such as phishing, network security, hacking, and secure data management.   Module 5: ‘Security’ in the sense of ‘protection of fundamental rights and democracy’  o This module focuses on cybersecurity risk type (c.5). In this module, the manifold  relationships between IT, security, privacy, and society are discussed.  o Recommended specific topics in this module include: ‘big Data’ and data mining;  informational self-determination and free speech rights, surveillance, and chilling  effects; privacy, transparency, and accountability; and ‘post-privacy’.   Module 6: ‘Security’ in the sense of ‘protection against procrastination’  o In this module, practical skills are introduced and exercised to enhance the  sustainability of learning outcomes.  o Recommended specific topics in this module include: methods for networking (e.g.  joint teaching projects on the European level as supported by etwinning.net or its  national analogues) as well as successful initiatives that foster student-centric learning  (such as recent editions of the Safer Internet Day).  (68) This discussion of accreditation and seals should, however, also discuss failures in the past (e.g. Rifon, N.J., LaRose, R., & Choi, S.M.  (2005). Your privacy is sealed: Effects of web privacy seals on trust and personal disclosures. Journal of Consumer Affairs, (39):339- 362). It should be made clear that security is never perfect and that having a seal or accreditation should not lead to an il lusory sense  of safety.  Roadmap for NIS education programmes in Europe  Education  October 2014  Page  19  Estimated results: School teachers across EU Member States are trained, awareness is raised, and  the level of online safety for young generations is enhanced. Institutional change is encouraged.  There is also potential for having a long-term and lasting impact on the wider EU society in a pan- European perspective.  Means to achieve the goals (didactical elements): A means to implement the curriculum proposal  is the pedagogic perspective of the Communities of Practice in which learners ‘engage in joint  activities and discussions, help each other, and share information. They build relationships that  enable them to learn from each other’. Therefore, learning becomes a social process taking place in  communities of learners that build a shared repertoire of practices: ‘They develop a shared  repertoire of resources: experiences, stories, tools, ways of addressing recurring problems—in short,  a shared practice. This takes time and sustained interaction’ ( 69 ). European platforms such as  etwinning.net could be used to coordinate and support follow-up activities that bring together  teachers, pupils, and other relevant stakeholders from different European countries.  The suggested approach considers offline courses with the target audience (teachers) coming  together (for short or long periods) for a collective learning experience and sharing their  experiences among colleagues, possibly across diverse countries, and learning from each other and  the diverse contexts. This approach could also have a positive impact on the perspective to ‘treat  security education as a global issue’ (70), fostering a pan-European perspective on transferring NIS  education from teachers to pupils.  The practical implementation of this approach focuses on linking (sometimes abstract) concepts  with real-life settings and impact. It includes: lectures for overview and structure; case studies, joint  development of ‘stories’ about privacy + security that structure a lesson series and their  components: informatics-centred exercises, cross-subject exercises, balance between knowledge,  and skills and attitudes development; concrete exercises with participants drawing on techniques  such as programming, data analysis, and role plays; lessons learned from empirical evaluations of  security-related teaching materials such as the adequacy of simulated (rather than authentic)  scenarios, the importance of individual reflection in a domain heavily influenced by peer pressure,  etc. can be used (71).; discussion of existing modules and lesson series and their applicability (or need  for adaptation) in course participants’ teaching practice.  These offline courses can be accompanied by structured collaborations on a platform such as  etwinning.net where teachers already organise joint courses, share their experiences, and carry out  further collaborative projects across borders. These continuing activities are key for ensuring  continuing professional development in the fast-changing area of security/privacy, and they also  embody a blended learning approach (offline courses plus online activities on the teacher platform)  needed for deriving maximum advantage from different media and interaction modi.  Means and incentives for stakeholders: According to a Eurydice report (72), continuing professional  development for teachers has gained importance in Europe and is considered a professional duty  in a majority of Member States. The same report notices that CPD activities could contribute to  promotions and that this is an incentive for teachers to undertake such activities. NISDL training  deliverers can leverage this need for teachers and tailor NISDL modules that would contribute to  (69) Wenger, E. 2007. Communities of Practice. A Brief Introduction.

This is linked with the observation that NIS educational activities for children in  Europe is usually jointly delivered by the ICT teacher and other teachers (73).  As mentioned in Section 2.3, ECDL already addresses teachers with a broader vision to consider  them key actors for a multiplier effect for IT security skills for citizens. This could constitute an  incentive for the creation of a tailored NISDL module for teachers. Furthermore, as noted before,  ECDL already has a module on IT security; this could also constitute a training of interest for the  target audience.  A further incentive for stakeholders relates to education on online safety being widely included in  the school curriculum in several EU Member States (see ‘Target audience’ above). Thus, teachers  can be offered training that they can transfer in their classes, in line with the goal of bringing  security and privacy education to schools.  Evaluation methods and metrics: Evaluation methods should include qualitative and quantitative  aspects. It would be possible to measure the number of school teachers (both in Europe as a whole  and in each Member State) entering CPD activities in the area of NIS education. This could offer  knowledge for targeted actions (in each Member State and in a pan-European perspective). It will  also offer information to stakeholders implementing NIS education modules in terms of where  conduct further targeted interventions and filled market gaps.  Qualitatively, teachers should be offered opportunities for self-assessment both in terms of how  NIS education training contributed to CPD as well as in terms of knowledge and skills acquired. This  will help teachers identify further training needs and opportunities. This evaluation will also offer  relevant information for stakeholders implementing NIS education modules as to where there is a  direct demand and gaps to fill.  To assess the continuing use of materials and activities for self-directed continuing professional  development, learning analytics such as those defined for the eTwinning platform (Berendt et al.,  2013) (74) could be employed.  Participants will also want to think about success metrics for their own courses. One option is to  test knowledge and transfer abilities of pupils by exams (75). Further metrics will be characterised  by an absence: an absence (or reduction) of regrets concerning behaviour in social media (76), an  absence of incidents of cyberbullying among pupils, an absence of hacking attacks on the school’s  infrastructure, etc. Such success metrics are, to the best of our knowledge, not yet existent for  education; measures from IT Security and penetration testing could serve as inspiration.

As such  we propose this scenario/module: “Information Security — Information  Security Management in Practice’, 7, 5 ECTS.  The principal basis for the content of the education is a Swedish framework  (SVISA framework) 77  for the deployment of an information security  management system (ISMS) supplemented with other material from  information security standards (ISO/IEC 27000), regulations, and research.  The SVISA framework was developed by the project SVISA led by the Swedish  Civil Contingency Agency (MSB).  The course is given in 6 blocks of 2 days and, between these blocks, practical  task assignments being conducted at the participants’ regular jobs.  Target audience Participants come from different areas of health care organisations and have  their backgrounds as clinical staff, business analysts, and/or IT professionals.  Main  stakeholders  involved  The course is given by Skövde University, the Computer Science Department,  on behalf of Västra Götaland County in Sweden. One of the course  coordinators is Dr Rose-Mharie Åhlfeld who is an IT security researcher and  university teacher. Also, information security professionals working in the  health care sector of Västra Götaland County have been involved when the  course was designed.  A similar course could also be held by other universities in cooperation with  other health care providers provided that they have a similarly qualified team  consisting of IT security and privacy researchers and IT security professionals  from the health care area.  Recommendations for implementation  Objective and  estimated results  The course has the objective to apply the SVISA framework with the expected  result that participants from the health care sector will gain knowledge and  understanding, skills and abilities, judgment, and an approach to implement  an information security management system (ISMS).  Incentives for  stakeholders  There are special legal requirements for safety, security, and privacy in the  healthcare sector (e.g. pursuant to the Swedish Patient Data Act) as well as  ethical obligations of the medical profession to keep patient data confidential  and safe. In Sweden, there are special incentives for healthcare providers to  have such an educational programme in place with the aim of increasing the  security knowledge and awareness of their clinical staff, business analysts,  and/or IT professionals, and successively establishing a security culture in their  organisations.  77  MSB (2014).

It includes an introduction and the following six blocks, including both  theoretical and practical elements: Block 1 — Business analysis, Block 2 — Risk  analysis, Block 3 — Gap analyses, Block 4 — Identify security measures and  processes, Block 5 — Develop and improve guidelines and instructions, Block  6 — Follow up and improve information security.  The theory part is based on standards for the introduction of ISMS (ISO/IEC  27000 family) as well as the latest research in order to provide in-depth  knowledge of the field. The practical part has its basis in the ISMS of the  participants’ working environment in order to practically train them to  implement the management system at the operational level. For this,  students have to conduct and apply practical application assignments  undertaken in the student’s working environment for providing the skills and  ability to apply ISMS in practice.  Metrics  The course examination consists of two parts where the results from the first  three blocks are presented at a seminar at half-time and the remaining data  from blocks 4-6 are presented in the final seminar at the course’s conclusion.  The students also have to submit a final report.  Evaluation  The students were present in the final report to include both reflections about  the course content and design. In the currently ongoing course there are no  written reflections, but the oral feedback so far has been clearly positive. Two  aspects were considered to be particularly valuable: the practical link of the  education with the student’s work and the seminar components where  students get a lot of input and feedback from each other. Furthermore, the  course organisers report that a key success factor of the education has been  the student group composition consisting of professionals from the  healthcare sector with different backgrounds and the motivation for  dedicated, creative discussions that have been extremely valuable and  rewarding.  The observations and comments from the participating parties of the time  that the course was hold were input for a SWOT-Analysis for the course.  Roadmap for NIS education programmes in Europe  Education  October 2014  Page  23  3.1.3 Data Protection Officers Scenario  Data Protection Officer Education  Summary Data Protection Officer Education, 7.5 ECTS.  Data protection officers (DPOs) designated by data controllers or processors  play an important role according to the European Data Protection Legal  Framework.  The proposed EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) requires that  data protection officers, pursuant to Art. 35, shall have expert knowledge of  data protection law and practices, and the ability to fulfil the tasks referred to  in Article 37. This includes the task to ‘monitor the implementation and  application of this Regulation, in particular as to the requirements related to  data protection by design, data protection by default and data security’ as well  as the task to ‘monitor the performance of the data protection impact  assessment by the controller or processor’.  The educational programme proposed here aims to educate lawyers and IT  security specialists on privacy law and privacy technologies for achieving the  qualifications required for data protection officers. Different specialisations  should be offered for lawyers and for information security specialists.  Target audience Students should already have a degree in law or computer science, or a related  subject with an academic and/or practical specialisation in IT security.  Main  stakeholders  involved  This programme can be offered by universities with a research or educational  profile in privacy or other qualified institutes/organisations.  Current status Dedicated programmes for educating data protection officials have already  been offered to Computer Science students by the Hochschule Ulm since the  early 1990s (78).  In addition to this, courses on privacy and privacy-enhancing technologies  (PETs) have been offered by several European universities such as Karlstad  University and the Royal Institute of Technology in Sweden (79), KU Leuven (80),  or other universities (81).  EuroPriSe GmbH offers 2+ days’ of international expert workshops addressing  legal or technical privacy professionals with in-depth knowledge in data  protection and privacy (82). It specifically introduces the EuroPriSe privacy seal  certification scheme, provides training evaluation, and focuses on privacy use  cases with the objective to provide participants with the opportunity to  qualify to become EuroPriSe evaluation experts.

Recommendations for implementation  The objective of the proposed educational programme is to provide lawyers or IT security  specialists with the qualification for becoming or assisting DPOs in organisations handling personal  data. The qualification required for DPOs comprises expertise in both data protection law and  privacy technology. As a result, participants will have knowledge of both domains. They will be able  to evaluate a design or product, highlight problems, and suggest improvements. They will be able  to communicate with other DPOs and experts from both the legal and the IT side.  Means and incentives for stakeholders: Knowledge transfer from universities to industry and  society is gaining increasing importance throughout Europe, not only in the form of joint research  projects but also in the form of training programmes offered for non-university members.  Incentives can be monetary (participation fees), knowledge transfer to society, and also the  knowledge transfer from participants and possible joint follow-up projects. In this way, academics  and practitioners gain new ways of engaging in and shaping societal debates and developments.  Universities that already offer such training events (83) could help others realise this potential by  sharing their expertise on organisation, benefits, and challenges.  The advantages of reciprocal knowledge transfer may be sufficient incentive for voluntary forms of  the proposed course. These may then be offered at irregular intervals within well-suited  environments that are typically non-permanent such as externally funded projects, and/or with  different specialisations in each iteration. If, in contrast, the training events are to offer not only  education and university-based certification of attendance and/or completion, but also an official  certification, they form a new task for universities that will typically go beyond their normal  teaching tasks and capabilities, and additional means and incentives are needed. Public funding  that covers actual costs should be provided to ensure that sufficient and qualified teaching  resources can be devoted to the courses.  Curriculum proposal and means to achieve it (didactical elements): The educational programme  consists of four parts.  The first part, for all participants, offers a basic introduction to privacy and data protection law (incl.  the concepts of privacy, data protection, and related rights and obligations, OECD Privacy  Guidelines, EU Data Protection Directive, EU e-Privacy Directive, GDPR, national data protection  laws as well as the tasks and responsibilities of DPOs, etc.) basic IT security concepts, privacy- enhancing technologies (incl. basic concepts for anonymous communication and application  protocols, anonymisation of databases, and privacy policy languages), Privacy Impact Assessment  and privacy by design.  In the second part, different specialisations are offered for lawyers and IT security specialists. The  legal specialisation will teach more details of privacy legislation and will train the legal evaluation  of systems and products. The technical specialisation provides more technical details of PETs (e.g.  mixes, Tor, blind signatures, zero knowledge proofs, anonymous credentials, k-anonymity and  differential privacy, P3P, PPL, privacy and identity management, transparency, and control tools)  and provides training events on the technical evaluation and certification of PETs.  (83) See the list of courses created by NIS Platform Working Group 3.  Roadmap for NIS education programmes in Europe  Education  October 2014  Page  25  The third part is complementary to the second part: Here, the objective is to teach the two  participant groups an understanding of the other’s conceptualisations. The objective of this part is  a deep understanding of privacy by design (PbD). Care will be taken to highlight typical pitfalls such  as the merely additive combination of data types, transfer, storage, and use from an ‘offline’ version  of the application task with technological safeguards such as encryption. This can be illuminated  with case studies of problematic or even failed PbD such as ELENA, the German Electronic Proof of  Earnings (84). The case studies will serve as important didactical elements in teaching the mixed  audience key elements of the others’ conceptual models of data protection and privacy. The reason  for this is that both designers and critics (such as DPOs with the task of overseeing or auditing a  privacy-by-design process or product) can often determine whether a system truly has ‘privacy built  in’ if they have (a) a formal model of requirements (both of the application task to be solved and of  the privacy requirements), (b) an understanding of the purpose and what its minimal data  requirements are, and (c)  state-of-the-art IT security. (85).  Based on this understanding, the fourth part concludes the programme with practical Privacy  Impact Assessment and privacy by design assignments and a privacy seal evaluation assignment.  Both will be conducted jointly by groups of students with technical and legal backgrounds. The  assignments should include learning methods such as role-plays that are appropriate for also  highlighting the difficulties of conflicting privacy requirements and their treatment in design.  Evaluation methods and metrics: The education programme is passed if the practical assignments  have been solved successfully and an oral or written test has been passed.  Oral and anonymous written course evaluations and reflections by students will be required after  different course elements (i.e. after the introduction, specialisations (part 2) and integration (part  3), and after each assignment).

This and the apparent lack of knowledge on and  awareness of the problem, could have a serious impact on the continuing  economic development of the EU — especially as the vast majority of all  European businesses are, in fact, SMEs. Unfortunately, as reported by a recent  workshop on cybersecurity training ( 89 ), private sector companies such as  SMEs, and to a lesser degree public sector organizations, are either unable or  unwilling to fund information assurance and security training. In addition,  those SMEs that are actively looking to improve their knowledge and  understanding of information security are forced down the ISO 270001 route  which, in most cases, is unnecessary and unobtainable. It is this lack of  knowledge, awareness, an over bureaucratic certification process, and of  course the lack of funding that are the key aspects of this problem. The  intention is to develop and deliver (via stakeholders — see below) a low-cost  mini ISO 270001 suitable for the working realities of SMEs.  Target audience SME owners and employees  Main  stakeholders  involved   Academic institutions (e.g. universities, polytechnics, colleges of  further education)   Certification bodies (e.g. IASME, (ISC)2, ISACA, SANS, etc.,)   Regional business associations (e.g. Federation of Small Businesses,  European Business Support Network, etc.,)   Regional development Organisations (e.g. Northumberland  Community Development Network, Association of Regional  Development Agencies, etc.,)   Regional & national government Organisations (e.g. Warning, Advice  & Reporting Points, International Cyber Policy Unit, Information  Commissioner’s Office, ENISA, Action Fraud, etc.,)   NGOs (e.g. Business Crime Reduction Centre, Scottish Business  Resilience Centre, The Analogies Project, Cloud Security Alliance,  etc.,)   Law enforcement agencies (e.g. NCA, Europol, etc.)  Current status This section of the scenario offers a list of materials, initiatives, and training  that illustrate the current status of implementation of this scenario with  regard to the target user (SMEs) in Europe. The list is not exhaustive and is  meant to provide an initial and reasoned overview:   ENISA (90) has developed NIS training material for SMEs  (86) Hayes, J., & Bodhani, A. (2013).

An EUIASME training/standard/certification would  offer a new, easily accessible and sustainable route for SMEs. In essence the EUIASME  standard (following its UK counterpart) will be developed as per the ISO27001 but  specifically tailored for small companies, while still demonstrating baseline compliance with  the international standard.   Encouraging participation: The biggest problems facing acceptance by SMEs, will firstly be  their reticence (it’s just another EU bureaucratic hurdle we have to jump over), and  secondly, how much it will cost. It is suggested that economic incentives for companies (in  (91) https://www.insemot.eu/en/  (92) http://www.isaca.org/Journal/Past-Issues/2012/Volume-6/Documents/12v6-SME-Cybersecurity.pdf  (93) https://www.securingthehuman.org/programs/sme  (94) https://www.sans.org/webcasts/practical-threat-management-incident-response-small-medium-sized-enterprise-98260  (95) www.cpni.gov.uk  (96) https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/cyber-essentials-scheme-overview  (97) https://www.iasme.co.uk/  Roadmap for NIS education programmes in Europe  Education  October 2014  Page  28  the same way as UK government cybersecurity vouchers (98) are used. In addition, there are  a group of SMEs that are required to undertake continuing professional development (CPD  Points). They are lawyers, accountants, solicitors, etc., and CPD points are a mandatory  element of their continuing professional recognition. In addition, this group could also be  considered as ‘enablers’, that is, they also have a client base, which in all probability would  also be SMEs.   Stakeholder incentives: starting from top to bottom:  - Academic institutions: The majority of UK higher education institutions will have  some form of business engagement/outreach programme targeted at local and  regional businesses; offering various business development activities, which will  include SMEs. The incorporation of the information assurance certification would  have added value for business support and development activities.  - The remainder (apart from certification bodies — see below) are all (certainly  within the UK) committed to the cause. This includes regional business associations  because they must be seen doing something, and regional development  organizations, government organizations, and NGO and law enforcement agencies  because they are all ‘on message’ and follow central government directives.  - The certification bodies: All their standards and certifications (CISSP, CISM, and  CISA), have been directed at large national and multi-national organisations.  However, they have recently realized that SMEs represent an untapped and  potentially quite profitable sector. This group represents the key to the success of  the project. If we are able to progress an EU standard (EUIASME) that these  organisations can develop, deliver, and then certify, then I suspect they would only  be too happy to get involved.  Evaluation methods and metrics: A mix of quantitative and qualitative measures  will be used. For example, quantitative metrics could be based on the number of  SMEs undertaking this specific training; in the UK, the Federation of Small Business  (FSB) estimate that 20 % of SMEs have undertaken some form of security training.  This metric could have a further differentiation, e.g. per sector (finance,  manufacturing, etc.), per country and at an EU general level. This will offer  information about the impact of the action and indication where there are gaps  and market needs. In addition, participants could also be offered qualitative  opportunities for self-assessment with further identification of existing gaps and  training opportunities to fill the identified gaps.  (98) https://www.gov.uk/government/news/support-for-small-businesses-to-tackle-record-levels-of-cyber-attacks  https://www.gov.uk/government/news/support-for-small-businesses-to-tackle-record-levels-of-cyber-attacks  Roadmap for NIS education programmes in Europe  Education  October 2014  Page  29  3.1.5 Digital Forensics Scenario  Digital Forensics Certification  Summary Given the current increases in cybercrime, it is suggested that many EU  organisations need highly skilled and professional individuals able to resolve  the problems with the collection, preservation, and analysis (e.g. digital  integrity and continuity of evidence) of cybercrime activities within an  organisational environment. In addition, such individuals will need to assist  the organisation in developing a tactical (e.g. incident response) and  strategic approach to the investigation of cyber criminal activities. Such  individuals must also consider the legal, social, and ethical issues when  undertaking an investigation within a work-based environment. Therefore, a  European work-based postgraduate certificate in digital forensics  investigations is proposed — the following sections will outline its structure  and implementation.  Target audience Public & Private Sector Organisations  Main  stakeholders  involved  Academic institutions (e.g. universities, polytechnics, colleges of further  education)  Law enforcement agencies (e.g. NCA, Europol, etc.)  Current status This section of the scenario offers a list of initiatives and training that  illustrate the current status of implementation of this scenario with regard to  the target user in Europe. The list is not exhaustive and is meant to provide  an initial and reasoned overview:  Commercial (Software Vendor) Organisations:  EnCase (99) is a suite of digital forensics developed by Guidance Software that  is designed for digital forensics, cybersecurity, and e-discovery. In addition to  the product, Guidance Software also provides training which can result in the  award of an EnCase Certified Examiner qualification (100). NB This requires  attending classroom sessions.  Access Data (101) also provides vendor specific training on its suite of software  products (e.g. Digital & Mobile Forensics, Litigation & E-Discovery, Cyber  Security). As with EnCase, Access Data also offers Certified Examiner  certification. In addition they also offer academic institutions ‘ready-made’  digital forensics courses.  Commercial (Training Providers) Organisations:  In the UK, companies such as FireBrand (102) offer a number of digital forensics  courses. Again, this requires attendance at classroom sessions. While at an  (99) https://www.guidancesoftware.com/training/Pages/encase-forensic-training-series.aspx?cmpid=nav  (100) https://www.guidancesoftware.com/training/Pages/ence-certification-program.aspx?cmpid=nav  (101) http://www.accessdata.com/  (102) http://www.firebrandtraining.co.uk/courses  Roadmap for NIS education programmes in Europe  Education  October 2014  Page  30  international level, the SANS Institute (103) has a number of digital forensics  certifications (non-vendor specific) ( 104 ). In addition, the SANS Technology  Institute ( 105 ) offers various degrees ( 106 ) in cybersecurity. However, new  enrolments on these programmes are normally limited to 100 per year.  Recommendations for implementation  Objective: to develop a work-based distance learning digital security postgraduate certificate  offered by various academic partners across the EU.  Proposed Curriculum: It is suggested that the programme could make use of the knowledge,  understanding, and/or skills specified by the UK Skills for Justice: National Occupational Standards  (NOS) (107): SFJ CO1: Identify and secure electronic evidence sources, SFJ CO2: Seize and record  electronic evidence sources, SFJ CO3: Capture and preserve electronic evidence, SFJ CO4:  Investigate electronic evidence, SFJ CO5: Evaluate and report electronic evidence, SFJ CO6: Conduct  Internet investigations, SFJ CO7: Conduct network investigations, SFJ CO8: Conduct covert Internet  investigations, SFJ CO9: Take first response actions in investigations involving digitally related  evidence, SFJ CO10: Provide single point of contact services for investigations into digitally related  crime, SFJ CB1: Gather and submit information that has the potential to support policing objectives,  SFJ DB4: Collate and provide papers for individual court/tribunal cases, SEM BIT4: Leading  workplace organisation activities, SEM BIT24: Leading the application of Six Sigma methodology to  a project, SEM BIT27: Leading the application of Six Sigma metrics to a project, SEM BIT29: Leading  the carrying out of capability studies. See Appendix A for NOS Learning Module.  The programme consist of the following modules:  Principles of Digital Forensics Investigations: focusing on the principles and techniques of  identifying and securing electronic evidence sources, including the capture and preservation of  digital evidence. The module will also introduce the types of investigations that can be undertaken,  and how to evaluate and report digital evidence.  Digital Forensics Investigation Strategy: In this module, individuals will evaluate current issues in  digital forensics investigations in the light of their company’s management, strategic, and  operational perspectives after which they will be able to provide a single point of contact when  investigating a digital related crime, take appropriate first responder actions, and prepare all  necessary documentation related to the digital crime.  Workplace Digital Forensics Project: In this module, individuals are required to identify and  successfully lead a workplace digital forensics project. The individual will be accountable for the  development and management of the project, and will ensure that the project provides sufficient  opportunities for personal, professional, and organisational development.  Estimated results: It is anticipated that the enhancement of the technical and business skills of IT  staff will help in raising the general business community’s awareness of cybercrime, and by  improving the conditions for business growth and successes, will ultimately benefit the EU. In  addition, the provision of a formal academic qualification (as opposed to vendor driven  certification) for practitioners will enhance the IT industry sector. Furthermore, the work-based  (103) http://www.sans.org/  (104) http://www.giac.org/certifications/forensics  (105) http://www.sans.edu/  (106) http://www.sans.edu/cyber-security-degrees  (107) http://nos.ukces.org.uk/Pages/index.aspx  Roadmap for NIS education programmes in Europe  Education  October 2014  Page  31  learning approach will help embed expertise into organisations and pull together practitioners  able to disseminate digital forensics intelligence across Europe.  Encouraging participation: Given that the programme is envisaged as being a work-based learning  programme with expert speakers delivering their sessions via e-learning platforms such as  Blackboard or via video streaming and podcasting, participants will not need to take time from their  work. This should prove beneficial to their concerned organisations. In addition, the programme  provides opportunities for participants to develop new and highly relevant technical and  managerial skills, enhancing their career prospects and encouraging their continuing professional  development.  Stakeholder Incentives  Academic institutions: For example, the majority of UK higher education institutions will have  some form of business engagement/outreach programme targeted at local and regional  businesses; offering various business development activities. Assuming that European institutions  have similar programmes, the incorporation of the information assurance certification would  provide added value to business support and development activities.  Law enforcement agencies: Anything that helps to reduce the impact of cybercrime and helps  with the detection and investigation of such activities will be welcomed by the majority of law  enforcement. In addition, we may find that such agencies would also like their own digital  forensics investigators to hold this academic qualification.  Evaluation methods and metrics: A mix of quantitative and qualitative measures will be used. For  example, quantitative metrics could be based on the number of organisations undertaking this  specific training. This metric could have a further differentiation, e.g. per sector (finance,  manufacturing, etc.), per country, and at an EU general level. This will offer information about the  impact of the action and indication where there are gaps and market needs. In addition,  participants could also be offered qualitative opportunities for self-assessment with further  identification of existing gaps and training opportunities to fill the identified gaps.  Roadmap for NIS education programmes in Europe  Education  October 2014  Page  32  3.2 Developing a pilot application on NIS self-assessment  ENISA has developed a self-assessment quiz as part of its NIS education activities. The audience for  this quiz is the broad public and the quiz is intended to combine an entertaining activity with a serious  goal: offer an opportunity for participants to familiarise themselves with some of the key themes of  NIS education and some of the ENISA recommendations, including material developed in recent years  by ENISA through its work. Some questions are also directly connected to the concepts introduced in  the first part of this report.  During the work of the expert team, several models for a quiz and delivery options were considered.  ENISA, together with the experts, agreed that the quiz should be a simple way to measure some of  the participants’ skills related to NIS but should also offer a way for participants to identify knowledge  and skills gaps and offer information on how to bridge these gaps. Furthermore, the experts agreed  that the quiz should contain opportunities for the participant to offer his/her own suggestions. The  quiz, therefore, is not just a way for the public to self-assess some of their skills, but it is also an  opportunity to offer their voice and discuss their own NIS challenges. Therefore, there is a form where  the participants can input their expectations about the quiz at the beginning of it. At the end of the  quiz, a further opportunity asking what could have been done differently is offered to participants.  This material will, at a later stage, be analysed and assist ENISA in its activities in the NIS education  area for the general public, including improving the existing quiz and the development of further  quizzes. Following the input form, at the beginning of the quiz, participants are required to select their  level of confidence about NIS: from low to medium to high level. Depending on the initial choice the  quiz offers increasingly more difficult questions for testing own skills and knowledge.  10 Narratives with questions or dilemmas  3 answers are presented for each question  Participants answer the question & receive  immediate feedback  Selection of skills level (Low, medium, high)  Participant’s  Feedback  A profile is generated  Roadmap for NIS education programmes in Europe  Education  October 2014  Page  33  The quiz contains 10 NIS questions and in total, together with input forms, it should take  approximately 10 minutes to complete. Each question starts with a short narrative and then a dilemma  or a direct question. For each answer (either correct or not) there is then a short  explanation/discussion with some further suggestions.  A profile will be generated based on the  overall result of the quiz. The profile can be one of the following:  1. Beginner: with limited number of correct answers. This profile signals limited level of skills or  knowledge of NIS (according to the quiz and the difficulty level selected by the participant).  2. Intermediate: good number of correct answers. This profile has a reasonable level of skills  and knowledge of NIS (according to the quiz and the difficulty level selected by the  participant).  3. Advanced: high number of correct answers. This profile has an excellent level of skills and  knowledge of NIS (according to quiz and the difficulty level selected by the participant).  For each generated profile further indications are being offered in terms of documentation and  material to consult with particular attention to ENISA reports. At the low and medium levels there is  also the suggestion for attempting the next confidence level quiz.  The application is available on the website www.cybersecuritymonth.eu from October 2014 as a pilot  with a possibility of renewal after the first evaluation.  Existing Self-Assessment Quiz  Some of the NIS education stakeholders offer self-assessment quizzes. In most cases they are intended  as preparation tests for certifications (e.g. CISM, CISA) or modules (ECDL IT Security). Therefore, they  have different goals compared to the ENISA NIS quiz which has a more general goal of signalling  relevance of certain subjects and to make relevant suggestions. The following is a list of the existing  relevant NIS self-assessment quizzes offered by the stakeholders:   ISACA — CISM-CISA Self-Assessment Exam (108): ISACA has a self-assessment quiz (multiple-  choice) whose goal is to prepare candidates for the certification exams.- The self-assessment  is made against the learning material and it is meant to be used in preparation for the exam.   ECDL IT Security Module (109): ECDL Foundation has a sample test (multiple-choice) for self-  assessment and the IT Security Module. The quiz allows testing knowledge about the  content for the ECDL IT Security Module.   ISC (studlSCOPE): Has a test that allows ‘enabling security staffs and individuals to assess  their knowledge of the (ISC) ² CBK®, taxonomy of information security topics that serves as  the foundation for all (ISC) ² certifications’ (110).   SANS Cyber Talent Skill Assessment Quiz: This quiz measures skills against the ‘Global  Information Assurance Certification (GIAC). SANS Cyber Talent Assessments can provide  benchmarks across many information security domains including communications security,  internet security, networking concepts and operating systems security’ (111).

Consequently, this lack of standard usage may limit the ability of  teachers to understand, explore, and hence teach cybersecurity basics in a structured manner,  resulting in lesson plans becoming a collection of ‘do’s and don’ts’, that do not support deep  learning and any form of reflection on that learning by the student. By deploying better  continuing education programmes for teachers we advocate for enhancing the multiplier role  they have. The scenario presented suggests an intervention on this specific target group  whose multiplier role means having increased capacities in terms of transferable NIS  education skills that could have a wide and lasting impact on EU Society and its citizens.   Massive Online Open Courses (MOOCs) may offer opportunities for the distance learning  delivery of network and information security modules to large audiences. Furthermore, this  approach could be easily adopted by interested stakeholders. Consequently, it is felt that  more emphasis should be placed on NIS and that European Institutions should start to develop  NIS MOOCs. In addition, any future pan-European MOOC initiatives should consider including  ‘NIS for Dummies’ modules within the programmes portfolio. To sum up, we advocate for:  more NIS MOOCs developed by European organisations over ‘traditional’ platforms where, at  the moment, most of them are developed by U.S. universities; that pan-European MOOC  initiatives should consider basic NIS modules in their portfolio.   By developing a course for health practitioners, participants from the health care sector could  gain knowledge and understanding, skills and abilities, judgment, and an approach to  implement an information security management system (ISMS).   For IT-security educational programmes for practitioners:  o There should be a practical link of the education with the participants’ work and  the security challenges that the participants face at their work places. Especially  practical assignments during this course should be designed accordingly to  address this requirement.  o It is also beneficial to have seminar discussions with groups consisting of  students coming from different disciplines and having different professional  backgrounds, representing people that typically should cooperate in  implementing security and creating a security culture in an organisation.   The development of the Data Protection Officers (DPOs) course directed at lawyers and digital  security specialists would help ensure that both groups have an understanding of data  protection laws and privacy technologies. Since participants will have knowledge of both  domains, technical specialists will be better able to evaluate a design or product, highlight  problems, and suggest improvements from a legal perspective, while a lawyer may be able to  do the same, but from a technical perspective.   The development of an EU information assurance training/education solution for the working  realities of SMEs may prove extremely useful in the fight against cybercriminal activities  directed at European SMEs.   The rising increases of digital crime directed at European private and public organisations  suggest that EU organisations require individuals skilled in digital forensics investigations and  the collection and presentation of digital evidence of the crime. The development of an EU-  Roadmap for NIS education programmes in Europe  Education  October 2014  Page  35  based academic recognition for continuing professional development in digital forensics may  help in the provision of those skilled investigators.  Furthermore, we invite the reader to consult the tools developed through this project:  1. The interactive map with NIS courses in Europe available on  www.cybersecuritymonth.eu compiled by the NIS Platform WG3 group. One can also add a  new reference simply by using the ‘ADD’ button.  2. NIS quiz addressed to all users for knowledge update, available on  www.cybersecuritymonth.eu.  As a final conclusion the authors suggest the idea of creating a Europass (112) for NIS Skills for the  general public, very much in line with the model of the Europass Language Passport (113). Skills can be  self-assessed for certain NIS areas (e.g. privacy, general security) and according to an established self- assessment frame. A ‘NIS Europass’ could facilitate, for example, jobseekers in applying for jobs across  Europe and could facilitate employers in assessing prospective candidates. Clearly the development  of this passport will require appropriate research and the need to work directly with key stakeholders  delivering NIS education for the public, work to be followed in the future by interested organisations.

Given its positioning, ENISA is active in the area of education and awareness, using its knowledge to  promote NIS skills and supporting the Commission in enhancing the skills and competence of  professionals in this area. This document continues work from previous activities by suggesting  training materials, scenarios and a way forward for implementing the EC roadmap for NIS education  in Europe (1). In doing so, the Agency has recognised the heterogeneous landscape of Europe in this  area.  This work was done in collaboration with educators for educators. The primary targets of this report  are professors and trainers that have daily activities in NIS education. The secondary target of this  report is policy-makers in the field of NIS education, those that make the decision on what enters the  curricula and which new courses are adopted.  The report is structured in three parts. The first part maps the courses and materials available. The  second part presents the gaps between existing training/certification schemes and market needs,  including proposals of scenarios to narrow the existing gaps. Finally, a list of recommendations is  presented for further steps and an open call from ENISA is available (2) in order to identify leading  organisations best positioned to further work on the implementation:   the authors suggest the creation of a Europass for NIS skills for the general public, very much  in line with the model from CEDEFOP(3);   Deploying better continuing education programmes for teachers for enhancing the multiplier  role they have. Solutions offered in scenario “Continuing Education for teachers”.    European organisations and authorities should start developing NIS MOOCs. Section on  MOOCs with examples.    Developing a NIS course for health practitioners. Examples accessible in “Healthcare  scenario”.   Developing a Data Protection Officers (DPOs) course directed at lawyers and digital security  specialists. Structure presented in “Data Protection Officers scenario”.   Development of an EU information assurance training/education solution for the working  realities of SMEs. Presented in “Small and Medium Enterprises scenario”.   Development of an EU-based academic recognition for continuing professional development  in digital forensics. Solutions accessible in “Digital Forensics scenario”.

ENISA has started the consultation process in order to involve the relevant stakeholders and guide the  process in order to ensure quality results and the publication of a report. This report introduces the  roadmap and its first steps that describe the certification ecosystem, relevant policies, stakeholders  involved, and the gaps that need to be addressed with innovative solutions.  ENISA is well positioned to respond to the challenge, taking into consideration the brokerage that it  has been achieving in the NIS environment in general and in NIS in Education in particular with the  publication of annual reports (7) in these areas.  The process followed for preparing this current report included a research phase, a large consultation  effort in order to involve all relevant stakeholders, and drafting the final document. The process is  depicted in the image below:  1.1 Policy context and the perspective of this work  As mentioned in the introduction, the EU Cyber Security Strategy “An Open, Safe and Secure  Cyberspace” suggests the development of a roadmap for Network and Information Security, as a  voluntary certification programme to promote enhanced skills and competence of professionals. As  we describe in this document, we are supporting this objective of the EU Cyber Security Strategy, by  proposing an NIS /cybersecurity pass.  Furthermore, the EU Cyber Security Strategy acknowledges that cybersecurity can only be sound and  effective if it is based on fundamental rights and freedoms. Any information sharing for the purposes  (6) http://ec.europa.eu/information_society/newsroom/cf/dae/document.cfm?doc_id=1667  (7) NIS in Education reports http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/stakeholder-relations/nis-brokerage-1/brokerage-model-for-  network-and-information-security-in-education  http://ec.europa.eu/information_society/newsroom/cf/dae/document.cfm?doc_id=1667 http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/stakeholder-relations/nis-brokerage-1/brokerage-model-for-network-and-information-security-in-education http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/stakeholder-relations/nis-brokerage-1/brokerage-model-for-network-and-information-security-in-education  Roadmap for NIS education programmes in Europe  Education  October 2014  Page  2  of cyber security, when personal data is at stake, should be compliant with EU data protection law (8)  and take full account of the individuals' rights in this field.  The Strategy also acknowledges the need for a: “voluntary certification programme to promote  enhanced skills and competence of IT professionals (e.g. website administrators)”, “training on NIS in  schools”, “training on NIS and secure software development and personal data protection for  computer science students” and “NIS basic training for staff working in public administrations”.  As such, our document has a broader perspective, from a general level of information security  knowledge for training in schools, basic knowledge to public administration personal – that needs to  understand security and data protection requirements –, up to specialized knowledge addressed to IT  professionals – responsible for managing, designing or developing secure IT systems and applications  that comply with data protection requirements.  1.2 Objectives  The main goals of this work are to define the roadmap and introduce steps that can be implemented  in order to be in line with best practice in NIS education.  The objectives of the roadmap are:  1. Provide an initial market analysis of the courses and certification schemes available.  2. Identify gaps between available training courses, certifications and NIS education needs.  3.  Suggest scenarios to narrow the gaps and provide best practices to organizations from all  Member States.  4. Plan further actions based on the needs of NIS communities.  5. Identify and select partners to continue and disseminate the work.  Regarding potential strategies to exchange best practices, ENISA will use its existing NIS education  communities to disseminate the work. e.g. the ECSM (European Cyber Security Month) community,  the NIS in Education group, partner universities, etc.  Representatives of NIS organisations that will show interest in this report and that want to contribute  should check the suitability of the proposed scenarios and suggest a way forward for implementation.  1.3 Target audience  This work has been prepared in collaboration with educators for educators. Professors and trainers  that have daily activities in NIS education represent the primary target. The secondary target is  represented by policy-makers in the field of NIS education, those that make the decision on what  enters the curricula and which new courses are adopted.  Note that this report tackles not only IT administrators but a larger audience, including training and  education solutions as already mentioned in the section dedicated to the perspective of this work.

We identified the topics of the scenarios by taking into account objectives of policy strategies, the  policy context and provisions, the experience of the experts group, and the advice of the European  Commission. For the purpose of this report we used desktop research and large consultation with  representatives of different organisations part of the consultative group. We formed the consultative  group as a result of a public announcement of this project.  In addition, the report benefits from the existence of some extra material:  1. A useful tool is the interactive map with NIS courses in Europe available on  www.cybersecuritymonth.eu compiled with the help of by the NIS Platform WG3 group.  2. A NIS quiz addressed to all users for updating knowledge available on  www.cybersecuritymonth.eu.  http://www.cybersecuritymonth.eu/ http://www.cybersecuritymonth.eu/  Roadmap for NIS education programmes in Europe  Education  October 2014  Page  4  2 Mapping the available courses and materials  This part of the study provides the reader with an overview of existing education materials, curricula  and courses. Furthermore, as the intention of this work is to provide way forward to address the  existing gaps, in this part we provide some scenarios to address existing needs, such as the lack of  proper data protection education for NIS professionals or for personal data processors.  2.1 Initiatives to gather information on existing certification and training  programmes  2.1.1 Cyber Security Month programmes database  In the context of the European Cyber Security Month initiative, a database has been established where  available courses and certification programmes linked to NIS and privacy/data protection are listed.  This database of available courses and certifications programmes is not an exhaustive list.  The data  presented has come from work produced by the NIS Platform WG 3 members, whom we thank for  their collaboration. Furthermore, the webpage allows educational institutions to add to the map  courses, programmes and training that deal with Network and Information Security. We invite the  reader to access the web address9.  2.1.2 Privacy and security related educational information and reference material  PReparing Industry for Privacy by design by supporting its Application in REsearch (PRIPARE) (10)  PRIPARE is a two-year FP7 support action (11) aimed at identifying and developing processes and tools  capable of facilitating the widespread application of a Privacy and Security by Design methodology.  Recognizing the essential role of stakeholders’ information and education about the risks, tools, best  practices, rights, and responsibilities associated with digital security and privacy, PRIPARE provides  educational information and reference material for the following set of stakeholders: general public,  ICT educators, ICT practitioners, policy-makers, and governmental and non-governmental bodies  acting for human rights protection. After a detailed analysis of stakeholder groups, their knowledge  needs were identified ( 12 ) and project partners are currently producing and testing educational,  information and reference material addressing these needs. Once validated, this material will be made  available online (13) in modular format.  Stakeholder analysis for PRIPARE support action. Sub-groups of stakeholders within the large  categories mentioned above have been identified and, for each one of these sub-groups, their  informational/educational needs have been defined in terms of the learning outcomes that the  educational material produced within the project should trigger. The general public was analysed on  the basis of their level of vulnerability. Practitioners were considered in terms of their professional  role, either managerial or development. The study of students’ needs was based on the type of their  degree (technical versus non-technical), the level of study (graduate, undergraduate), and career  goals. Regarding policy and legal stakeholders, we have identified policy-makers and governmental  bodies acting at different geographical levels (national, European, international) as well as non- governmental bodies, including NGOs, think tanks, civil society organisations, and legal professionals.

The modules being produced respond to  the knowledge needs identified in the stakeholder analysis phase, address privacy risks (c1-c5) and  focus on privacy rights (e.g. OECD Privacy Guidelines, EU Data Protection Directive, EU ePrivacy  Directive, etc.). Each module is implemented in the format best suited for communication of the  specific content to the specific stakeholder group, ranging from standard slide presentations to  crossword puzzles, from videos to infographics, from exercise series to structured references to  academic literature, etc. Sets of modules can be compiled to create curricular structures, workshop  material, individual lectures, awareness campaigns, etc. The complete list of modules is described in  the PRIPARE deliverable 4.114. Below are a few examples of modules for two of the stakeholders  groups: the general public and the engineering practitioners.  Modules for the general public aim to raise awareness about Privacy by Design (PbD), the dangers of  privacy violations and users’ rights; they also explain the actions users may take in case of privacy  infringement. They cover PbD in specific contexts, the tools for privacy protection, and methodologies  for risk management. Modules for practitioners introduce PbD principles and concepts; themes  include privacy context (the legal context as a source of privacy requirements for a software  development process), risk management (what it is and its benefits for a software development  process, privacy impact assessment as a risk management methodology applied to PbD), best  practices (e.g. privacy patterns), technologies and solutions for privacy protection, and finally, the  testing and validating of the outcomes of the PbD process. Other specific knowledge modules for  engineering practitioners cover privacy patterns, privacy failures, Privacy Design Strategies, location  privacy, anonymous cash, etc.  Modules Assessment in PRIPARE support action. Assessment work includes initiatives such as a  seminar providing training on Privacy by Design to members from academia, EU research projects, and  industry with a focus on technology (15), a round table with DPAs (i), and university courses. In a course  designed by members of the PRIPARE consortium (16), it demonstrates how Privacy by Design may be  effectively taught to a combined group of undergraduate and graduate students in the social sciences  whose knowledge of technology is limited to their own user experience. The curriculum explores a  new educational space at the theoretical intersection of human rights and digital technology while  integrating a practical component that allows students to produce educational materials for  stakeholder audiences; this merging of theory and practice provides our students with the opportunity  to reflect on the convergence of law and technology. The curriculum incorporates Ann Cavoukian’s  set of seven guiding principles (17) as core learning objectives and uses the principles in contexts that  are not limited to Privacy by Design, showing how they can effectively be applied to other contexts at  the interface of human rights and digital technology. Each of Cavoukian’s seven principles is addressed  through the lens of a case study, with issues selected on the basis of their cross-cutting impact.  Regardless of whether the high level of user mistrust concerning privacy protection of digital  information is justified, international human rights law and the robust Data Protection Regulation  proposed by the European Commission require protection of online privacy. Educational materials for  various types of stakeholders were produced in interaction with students. The focus is on the practical  problem of how to best implement the right to privacy on a day-to-day basis. Providing an already  mistrustful population with privacy-enhancing knowledge and tools is a seminal example of the mis  en oeuvre of participatory action research methods.

Only by privileging the broader perspective can we deliver on the promise of digital technology to  enhance democratic dialogue and facilitate human lifestyles, and make sure that it is safe to use for  the generations to come.  Expected Uses of the Material and Outcomes of PRIPARE support action. The Consortium of the  project hopes that the information-educational material produced by the project will facilitate the  dissemination and application of Privacy by Design principles and methodology. On one hand, the  modules will increase stakeholders’ familiarity with their privacy-related rights and responsibilities  and with the current and potential technical solutions aimed at supporting the effective  implementation of such rights and responsibilities. On the other hand, the modules will promote a  mature reflection on the impact of privacy choices (both technical and regulatory) on societal  structures such as businesses, industry, education, healthcare, transportation, etc. Overall, the  educational material will disseminate the results and support the vision of the PRIPARE project to help  ‘forge sustainable links between the different privacy stakeholders (regulators, educators, engineers  and standardisation organisms) in order to set the necessary common grounds on which to build  trustworthy and privacy-respectful systems’ (18).  2.2 NIS programmes for school education: an overview  School education is one factor used to reach the goal of helping minors to use the Internet in a ‘safe’  way and is widely perceived as an important component for improving cybersecurity (19). Reflecting on  this perceived importance, a multitude of materials and associated activities such as training events  and certification are being offered to teachers on the Web. The materials that we surveyed do not  refer to a common theoretical or even terminological base (20). Therefore, we begin this section by  proposing a structure on the basic concepts that will allow us to then overview and relate materials  to one another. Based on this overview, we will make a proposal for a more comprehensive training  programme in the scenario of Section 3.1.4.  THE BASIC CONCEPTS: CYBER RISKS AND SAFETY  In line with the well-known observation that doom scenarios do not have educational effects, the  Internet/Web is introduced as a space full of opportunities but also of risks. In the following, we will  call these cyber risks. The goal of the educational intervention is to turn this situation into a safe (or  safer) space (21): thus, safety is implicitly defined to be a state in which these risks are mitigated. (As in  other spaces with risk, a complete elimination is probably not possible, although this is not discussed  explicitly.) The focus is on threats to the individual (here: the minor, the pupil) and on precautions that  the individuals themselves can take to mitigate the risks. The effects that one person’s privacy-related  behaviour has on others mostly remain implicit: the Internet will be safer/better for all if all exhibit  safe behaviour. Thus, cyber risks, the state in which they are mitigated and safety are conceived of  similarly to, for example, road traffic.

(2014) observe that most materials are not based on any theory and that only very few have been  evaluated. Vanderhoven, E., Schellens, T., & Valcke, M. (2014). Educational packages about the risks on social network sites:  state of  the art. Procedia — Social and Behavioural Sciences, 112, 603-612.  (21) An example is the activities around the annual ‘Safer Internet Day’; see below.  Roadmap for NIS education programmes in Europe  Education  October 2014  Page  7  A TAXONOMY OF CYBER RISKS  The cyber risks typically discussed comprise (a) the risk of encountering inappropriate material which  may comprise disturbing materials (violence, sexual content) or materials that can easily be  misinterpreted especially by minors (false information, satire, etc.); (b) the risk of committing a  criminal or otherwise sanctioned act oneself (copyright violations, plagiarism); and, increasingly, (c) a  range of cybersecurity issues that typically involve violations of the pupil’s own personal sphere or  that of his/her friends (22). We use cybersecurity in the sense of ‘the state of being protected from the  criminal, unauthorised or otherwise undesired use of data, computer hardware or software’ (23) and  the notion that ‘security’ is a form of ‘safety’ that focuses on being protected against external  threats (24). We do not regard (a) or (b) as cybersecurity issues because their focus is not on a personal  sphere or a computational environment being intruded upon. However, it should be noted that the  categories are not mutually exclusive. For example, pupil A may utter ‘hate speech’ (category b or  verging on it) that deeply troubles pupil B (category a). Also, if pupil A cyberbullies pupil B, this may  be both criminal and invasive of B’s personal sphere (and damaging to A too). Within such a mixed set  of problems, we will focus on their contribution to category (c) risks.  A TAXONOMY OF CYBERSECURITY RISKS  In the remainder of this section and in line with this report focus, we will concentrate on category (c),  the cybersecurity issues deemed relevant for the school education of minors. The criterion of dividing  (c) into sub-categories reflects the origin of the type of risk under consideration.  (c.1) Contact risks (25): abuses of data that identifies an individual  These risks comprise third parties (other people) communicating with the individual in undesired and  often unexpected ways. Examples include cyberbullying and grooming ( 26 ). Such risks may be  intensified by the frequency with which minors interact with strangers online (27). In general, a main  reason leading to these risks is the abuse of identifying personal data given away voluntarily by the  individual.  (c.2) Invisible audiences and context collapse (28) unintended/inappropriate audiences for data that  profile an individual  (22) This top-level taxonomy is inspired by De Moor et al. (2008), reused by Vanderhoven et al. (2014).  (23) This combines the definition from the Oxford English Dictionary (‘The state of being protected against the criminal or unauthorized  use of electronic data, or the measures taken to achieve this’, http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/cybersecurity)  and whatis.com (‘Cybersecurity is the body of technologies, processes and practices designed to protect networks, computers,  programs and data from attack, damage or unauthorized access. […]’. http://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/cybersecurity) Other  definitions are broader still, highlighting only the protection aspect without detailing what to protect against, for example  the  definition by the International Telecommunication Union: ‘Cyber security is the collection of tools, policies, security concepts, security  safeguards, guidelines, risk management approaches, actions, training, best practices, assurance and technologies that can be  used  to protect the cyber environment and organization and user’s assets. Organisation and user’s assets include connected computing  devices, personnel, infrastructure, applications, services, telecommunications systems, and the totality of transmitted and/or stored  information in the cyber environment.’ Definitions focusing on ‘unauthorised’ uses assume fully rational decision-makers. However,  since privacy and security violations often occur after consent has been given only implicitly, or even after informed consent, we  added ‘or otherwise undesired’.

Among other things, this may involve ‘the wrong  people getting a piece of information, maybe in the future’. In educational materials, this is usually  projected to a few socially stereotyped behaviours and their assumed consequences: alcohol, (near-)  nudity, and swearing are portrayed as ‘risky information’ (and thus, implicitly, their opposites as ‘safe’)  with regard to impressions made on teachers, peers, and potential future employers (e.g. Moreno et  al., 2009 ( 29 ); Vanderhoven et al., 2013 ( 30 )). The main reason leading to these risks is the  decontextualised use, generally by peers or other people, of communication and profiling personal  data given away voluntarily by the individual. A twofold strategy is recommended against these risks:  (a) to use access control options (‘privacy settings’) judiciously when sharing any information and (b)  to not share ‘risky information’ at all over social media, since even with carefully selected audiences,  future (ab)uses cannot be predicted or prevented.  While this approach can be helpful, it is also problematic because of its often only implicit ethical  judgements and the assumption of stable and predictable categories of ‘risky information’. This may  lead to the illusion that by simply not sharing this type of information (but sharing everything else),  one can be ‘safe’. The learning objective should not only be to avoid these risks, but also to appreciate  and apply data minimisation as a general principle, to be aware that there can never be full certainty,  and to use technology with a critical and informed perspective.  (c.3) Context collapse II: repurposing of data for commercial and other ends  Common notions of ‘digital literacy’ as a learning goal focus on knowledge and skills related to content  risks and security risks (c.1) and (c.2). Other types of risks are currently covered less.  Some authors writing about school education analyse undesired uses of personal data by commercial  entities (e.g. De Moor et al., 2008; Vanderhoven et al., 2014). These include the commercial misuse of  personal data. Information can be shared with third companies via applications and user behaviour  can be tracked in order to provide targeted advertisements and social advertisements (31). In addition  to causing annoyance, profiling may also lead to discrimination in access to services, jobs, etc. A main  reason leading to these risks is the decontextualised and repurposed use, by commercial entities, of  personal data given away voluntarily by the individual.  (c.4) IT security risks include malware, phishing, pharming, or hacking. Some authors present  empirical findings showing poor dealings with passwords among minors (sharing passwords with  others, infrequently or never changing passwords, poor knowledge of what a strong password is (32).  Reasons leading to these risks are the exploitation, by others, of weaknesses in computer software,  hardware, and human naivety.  (c.5) Cybersecurity conflicts of interest in the fabric of society and democracy  The categories described so far (and most teaching materials) implicitly assume that safety, security  and privacy are well-defined and generally agreed-upon values. However, as the privacy literature and  current public debates show, this is not the case. Regarding protections against intrusions by peers  (the main topic of categories (c.1) and (c.2), culture and education may work towards shared values  of respect for other’s spaces. However, this is less straightforward with regard to the relationships to  (29) Moreno, M. A., Vanderstoep, A., Parks, M. R., Zimmerman, F. J., Kurth, A., & Christakis, D. A. (2009).

(32) Sharples et al. (2009), see above.  Roadmap for NIS education programmes in Europe  Education  October 2014  Page  9  institutions (commercial entities as in category (c.3) or government entities). Individuals’ and groups’  rights to privacy vis-à-vis institutions may be legally protected, for example via data protection laws  or fundamental rights such as informational self-determination (Germany) or the Fourth Amendment  (U.S.A)33. However, other interests and rights held by the individual and/or others may conflict with  these rights. These other interests and rights include contract freedom and the business model of  financing a not-for-payment service by exploiting personal data, criminal investigations, or national  security (for a critical discussion, see Solove, 2011 (34)). Yet other rights such as freedom of speech are  intimately tied up with privacy and security rights.  In other words, privacy and security are essential (and non-trivial) components of democracy and thus  a necessary component of school education beyond informatics and also beyond the notion of digital  literacy explained above. It is important to note that in this area of NIS education, the diversity of  Europeans must be respected. Specifically, the nested  identities of Europeans — as citizens of Europe  but also of their respective country and maybe even region — implies that national laws and culture- specific histories and concepts, in particular of privacy, must be a focus of teaching in addition to pan- European or even global content.  This would reflect the cultural diversity in the EU and the  determining impact it has on education. Such diversity can occur at different levels.  Factors include national (or even personal) histories of regimes with intensive surveillance, such as in  Germany or former communist states of Eastern and Central Europe, and likewise the histories of  media coverage of and civic engagement against surveillance. School curricula themselves are a  determining factor: is computer science being taught at all? (While it is well-entrenched in some  European countries, it barely exists in others.) How much time can be allocated to a novel and cross- disciplinary content such as privacy/security education?(35). Finally, \"cultural variables\" such as the  relative focus on individualism vs. collectivism may affect the extent of learners' initiative and learning  behaviour and therefore choices of didactic methods36.  AN OVERVIEW OF MATERIALS AND TRAINING EVENTS  In the following paragraphs, we give an exemplary overview of materials and training events, with a  specific focus on European-level resources, and highlight their respective foci on selected categories  of cyber risks/ cybersecurity risks. We also outline possible ways forward.  Basic requirements: ENISA has identified key points and success factors for teaching security in  schools in the 2012 report ‘Collaborative Solutions for Network Information Security in Education’ (37).  The report also contains descriptions and pointers to selected school projects, e.g. on the separation  of digital identities (regarding risk category c.2). Key findings from the report are offered as  downloadable posters that can be used for dissemination (38).  (33) The right to informational self-determination was formulated in the German Federal Constitutional Court ruling on the Census of 1983:  \"[...] in the context of modern data processing, the protection of the individual against unlimited collection, storage, use and disclosure of  his/her personal data is encompassed by the general personal rights of the German constitution. This basic right warrants in this respect the  capacity of the individual to determine in principle the disclosure and use of his/her personal data. Limitations to this informational self- determination are allowed only in case of overriding public interest.\" This ruling has strongly influenced subsequent German and European  data protection legislation. The Fourth Amendment of the US Constitution is \"the right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses,  papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause,  supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.\" Surveillance  and other privacy invasions are often regarded as breaches of the Fourth Amendment (e.g. Slobogin, C. (2008). Privacy at Risk: The New  Government Surveillance and the Fourth Amendment. Chicago, IL: University of Chicago Press).  (34) Solove, D. (2011). Nothing to hide.

This is a computer literacy certification with several  modules, one of which is IT Security (39), i.e. our category (c.4). Its focus lies on ‘the secure use of ICT  in daily life’ and on ‘managing data and information appropriately’.  ECDL/ICDL also recommends its certification for teachers, emphasizing the advantages of using ICT for  teaching (e.g. creation of online content) and related and administrative tasks (e.g. online  communication with students and parents, management of student data) (40).  Certification (accreditation) for institutions is discussed as a sub-point of European Schoolnet  activities, to be discussed next.  European Schoolnet, a network of 31 European Ministries of Education, offers teaching materials and  infrastructure for teacher collaboration, resources directly addressing pupils, activities and  frameworks for pupil-/teacher-led activities, and a first step towards certification for schools as  institutions:   The materials collection Insafe in the Learning Resources Exchange: close to 300 resources on  topics such as digital literacy, cyberbullying, safe searching, or privacy and personal information,  with a focus on categories (a), (c.1), and (c.2) (41). Resource types vary, including lesson series  descriptions and detailed materials, games, and interactive websites. Other materials have been  created by the National Safer Internet Centres (42). Their foci resemble those of Insafe materials.   Infrastructure: the European networking platform (43) for teachers.   Activities framework: the annual Safer Internet Day (44)   Institutional accreditation: ‘The eSafety Label offers an Assessment Form covering the broad  range of actors who can impact, within and beyond the school walls, the level of eSafety of an  educational institution. Based on a school’s results, an Action Plan is drawn up to increase the  level of eSafety, which might lead the way towards eSafety Label Accreditation […] (45). Sample  questions indicate that the notion of ‘eSafety’ used covers (at least) selected aspects of IT security  (c.4) such as protection against malware, and of privacy, such as having a school policy about  taking photographs of and by pupils (c.2).   Incentive schemes: ENISA and European Schoolnet created an award for ‘Teaching online safety  and citizenship’ in schools (46) with the 2010 winner project focusing on contact risks (category c.1  above) and online games.  Teaching materials and training events on IT security: e-skills UK, the United Kingdom’s sector skills  council for the IT industry, offers teaching resources with a view to attracting pupils to cybersecurity  careers. It offers various basic 20-30 minute modules on issues and methods mostly of category (c.4)  such as phishing, hacking, digital forensics, and cross-curricular resources ( 47 ).

Similar  initiatives, especially hackathons etc. focusing on spotting pupils with cybersecurity talents, are now  emerging across Europe (for example, see the presentations at the 2014 ENISA Workshop on Cyber  Security Issues in Europe (49).  Teaching materials and training events about the economic and democratic issues of privacy and  security: In spite of the growing perception of the importance of these issues (for example, see the  sections on tracking and the monetisation of personal data in the 2012 ENISA report) and the presence  of good work in the privacy literature, this is hardly covered in today’s teaching materials. Exceptions  include materials and lesson plans developed in the context of the interdisciplinary SPION (‘Security  and Privacy in Online Social Networks’) project: from the short treatments of economic risks in the  privacy manual (50), via its extension and evaluation in Vanderhoven et al (51)., to the lesson series ‘If  you’re not paying for it, you’re the product’ (52) that explores the cybersecurity risk categories (c.3)  and (c.5) in detail and in their interrelationship, and the teacher training workshop based on it (53).  Additional teaching forms: ISC2 (International Information Systems Security Certification  Consortium), a membership body of certified information and software security professionals that is  best known as a certification body (e.g. CISSP, accredited by ANSI as ISO Standard 17024:2003), offers  one-hour presentation visits of volunteer security practitioners at schools (54). Target groups are pupils  aged 7-10 or 11-14 and parents. Judging from the content that is available online, content is a  combination of issues from the categories (c.1), (c.2), and (c.4) (cf. The ‘Safe and Secure Online Top 10  Tips’ (55).  CONCLUSIONS  In summary, this overview shows that:   There is an abundance of materials and programmes for helping European teachers learn about  and teach cybersecurity;   While some cybersecurity risks and remedies are covered well (especially contact risks and  invisible audiences / context collapse, with IT security being well-covered but only partially so for  school purposes), others are touched on rarely (commercial risks such as the repurposing of  personal data) or very rarely (privacy, security, and democracy);   The non-uniform use of terms such as ‘safety’ and ‘security’ and various derivatives of these  words, and the lack of definitions or theoretical underpinnings, may make it difficult for teachers  to perceive, explore, and teach the field in a structured fashion. The risk is that lesson plans  become a rather arbitrary collection of ‘do’s and don’ts’ that seem unrelated and do not support  deep learning, reflection, and transfer skills.  In the scenario described in Section 3.1.4, we will propose a way to improve on this situation.

A current trend in education is the emergence of MOOCs – Massive Online Open  Courses (56). MOOCs are a new way of delivering online education and cater for a wide audience,  although there is debate on this.  MOOCs are currently being used also to deliver NIS education,  however the current status of MOOCs in this specific area is quite fragmented. In this section we  provide an initial overview on the status of NIS MOOCs, also focusing on two key relevant aspects: a  MOOC on the subject of Cybersecurity funded and supported by the UK Government as part of its  Cybersecurity policy and a MOOCs platform launched by the EU Commission which can offer relevant  opportunities within the EU context. Courses resemble university courses in terms of content and  breadth, but the delivery model, assessment and peer collaboration is different from traditional  university courses. MOOCs are delivered via tailored online platforms. In most cases they are free and  open to access, but the platforms could be both commercial and non-commercial. They are often  delivered by elite universities from Europe and the U.S. and hence there is the promise for top level  education for a wider audience. However, MOOCs have so far seen a high level of enrolment coupled  with a low level of completion ( 57 ). However, it needs to be noted that, according to some  commentators, the completion rate should not be considered as the key metric for MOOCs viability,  and other benefits come from access to high quality material, peer collaboration, and learning  experiences (58). Data also shows that students completing MOOCs often already possess bachelor  degrees (59). This could be a relevant aspect to consider when the audience for this project module is  mainly composed of IT professionals or teachers (i.e. professionals already possessing bachelor  degrees) that would seek to obtain further training in specialised areas (e.g. NIS), via a MOOC module.  MOOCs could hence constitute an interesting avenue for NIS education and a way of delivering NIS  Education modules to large audiences. This is an approach that can be potentially embraced by  interested stakeholders. In particular, there are two aspects in this perspective that could contribute  to the interests in MOOCs. Firstly, among Member States for instance, the UK is actively looking at  MOOCs as part of its Cyber Security Strategy. In a document titled ‘The National Cyber Security  Strategy Our Forward Plans (60)’, there is an indication that the government is investing in MOOCs as  part of its plan to increase NIS training and in particular: ‘the Open University is developing a Massive  Open Online Course (MOOC) on cyber security to be run for the first time by summer 2014. The course  has the potential to reach 200,000 students, including internationally. The MOOC is intended to run  over an eight week period and will be presented four times a year for three years. The goal is to help  raise awareness of cyber security among a mass audience as well as providing a high-quality course  which will make the subject accessible to non-specialist learners and encourage those with an interest  in the subject to study further’. The Open University MOOC on Cyber Security has opened for  registration in September 2014 and lecturing started in October of the same year. In the perspective  of the NIS education roadmap, results of this MOOC (in terms of reached audience, attendance, and  awareness raising) could offer indication for future diverse implementations of NIS modules via MOOC  platforms.  A second relevant aspect to consider is that the EU Commission is also looking at this  delivery model with a focus on using MOOCs to bridge gaps in digital and IT skills. The Commission has  (56) See for an exhaustive review. https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/240193/13-1173-  maturing-of-the-mooc.pdf  (57) See, for instance, completion data from MIT and Stanford. http://www.edtechmagazine.com/higher/article/2014/02/harvardxs-and-  mitxs-mooc-data-visualized-and-mapped  (58) https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/240193/13-1173-maturing-of-the-mooc.pdf  (59) http://theinstitute.ieee.org/ieee-roundup/opinions/ieee-roundup/low-completion-rates-for-moocs  (60)  https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/265386/The_National_Cyber_Security_Strategy_ Our_Forward_Plans_December_2013.pdf  https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/240193/13-1173-maturing-of-the-mooc.pdf https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/240193/13-1173-maturing-of-the-mooc.pdf http://www.edtechmagazine.com/higher/article/2014/02/harvardxs-and-mitxs-mooc-data-visualized-and-mapped http://www.edtechmagazine.com/higher/article/2014/02/harvardxs-and-mitxs-mooc-data-visualized-and-mapped https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/240193/13-1173-maturing-of-the-mooc.pdf http://theinstitute.ieee.org/ieee-roundup/opinions/ieee-roundup/low-completion-rates-for-moocs https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/265386/The_National_Cyber_Security_Strategy_Our_Forward_Plans_December_2013.pdf https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/265386/The_National_Cyber_Security_Strategy_Our_Forward_Plans_December_2013.pdf  Roadmap for NIS education programmes in Europe  Education  October 2014  Page  13  already taken steps for ‘launching a network of providers of MOOCs related to web and apps skills (61).’  European Commission Vice President Neelie Kroes, responsible for the Digital Agenda, said: ‘By 2020,  90 % of jobs will need digital skills. That is just around the corner, and we aren’t ready! Already  businesses in Europe are facing a shortage of skilled ICT workers. We have to fill that gap, and this  network we are launching will help us identify where the gaps are.’ (62) In addition to this, a pan- European MOOC platform ( 63 ) was launched by the Commission, financed through the Lifelong  Learning Programme. This platform now hosts a number of MOOCs, some related to IT skills (e.g.  computer programming, network architecture), but currently no course is directly related to NIS  education.  MAPPING MOOC COURSES  The following is a non-exhaustive list of MOOCs in the area of NIS courses. Few of these are or were  delivered by European universities and institutes with the majority being delivered by U.S. universities.  This might be an aspect to consider in a pan-European perspective and offer a further  recommendation for action with more NIS MOOCs delivered by European entities.

Furthermore, scenarios will be suggested to provide best practices to organizations from  all Member States with the hope that, together with the consultative group, we may plan further  actions based on the needs of NIS communities and identify partners to continue, implement, and  disseminate the work.  3.1 Recommending NIS education scenarios for a pan-European Level  The scenarios were developed by following an agreed-on template with publicly available information  from universities, institutions, and other projects.  The scenarios are put forward for wider debate and dissemination in order to achieve a truly  consultative process. This can be considered as the theoretical part, phase one of the initiative, with  a phase two to follow for implementation by public-private partnerships or single organisations that  have the will and resources to put the scenarios into practice.  The scenarios can be implemented as activities for continuing professional development for  professionals from the respective scenario’s target group(s). We would like to emphasize that these  scenarios should be viewed as frameworks for concrete implementations. For example, concrete  implementations should be adapted to their specific contexts (such as the duration of the course).  Also, these scenarios can, by definition, only portray the area at the time at which this report was  written. Given the rapid developments in the NIS area (in terms of technology, vulnerabilities, user  behaviour and concerns) and also evolving legal frameworks, concrete implementations of the  scenarios should strive to keep materials and course contents up-to-date.  Roadmap for NIS education programmes in Europe  Education  October 2014  Page  15  3.1.1 Continuing Education for Teachers Scenario  Security and Privacy: Continuing Professional Development (CPD) for School Teachers  Summary  According to a 2012 ENISA Report (64), ‘Cyber security is generally in the hands  of specialists who implement technical solutions. Citizens and SMEs (Small and  Medium Enterprises) are left out of this action despite the fact that a thorough  awareness of end users about cyber security is the first line of defence against  cyber threats. As such, these players must be provided with the skills to protect  their devices, their data, and their online identity’.  The Eurobarometer survey on cyber security (65) revealed that ‘Most EU citizens  do not feel very or at all well informed about the risks of cybercrime (59 %)  while 38 % say they are very or fairly well informed. There is a clear link  between being well informed and feeling confident online’. The same survey  also discovered socio-demographic variations, for instance, access to the  Internet or type of crime in which citizens of different ages are victims. Among  other categories of citizens, children and young adults deserve particular  attention. On average, children start using the Internet at the age of 7.  Together with quality content, they need to be provided with appropriate skills  and awareness for ensuring their safety online.  This scenario aims to close the gap identified in the 2012 ENISA report. It  suggests an intervention on a specific target group whose multiplier role  means that having increased capacities in terms of transferable NIS education  skills could have a wide and lasting impact on EU society and its citizens, and  in particular on children and young adults: school teachers.  This target group is interesting not only because of their role as societal  multipliers. Teachers are also a target group specifically interested in  continuing professional development and ‘life-long learning’. With informatics  topics in particular, many school teachers face the challenge that pupils  consider themselves more knowledgeable ‘about computers’, ‘about social  media’, etc. than the teachers. To meet this challenge, it is particularly  important that school teachers display and express well-founded, structured  knowledge and reflection. In addition, a school itself is an environment in  which practical measures can be tested and institutionalised (such as the  responsible dealings with personal data of pupils, teachers, and other  personnel). To the extent that teachers can be agents of change in this way,  they can set examples for effective action orientation.  In sum, we therefore consider developments of training activities for the target  group of school teachers a possible blueprint for life-long learning activities  which can also be used for other citizens.  (64) http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/other-work/eisas_folder/eisas-large-scale-pilot, p.1.  (65) http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/archives/ebs/ebs_404_en.pdf  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/other-work/eisas_folder/eisas-large-scale-pilot http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/archives/ebs/ebs_404_en.pdf  Roadmap for NIS education programmes in Europe  Education  October 2014  Page  16  Target audience School teachers of computer science and with other specialisations who want  to offer courses on privacy and security for children and teenagers. This mix of  participants is essential for our concept of security/privacy education being an  overarching topic: neither only technical nor only social. Ideally, the courses  will stimulate collaboration between teachers across traditional boundaries of  their subjects.  According to a Eurydice report, ‘education on online safety (OS) is included in  the school curriculum in 24 countries/regions’ ( 66 ), but the EU Kids Online  Report remarks that ‘in many countries, teachers provide little in the way of  safety awareness and training to guide pupils’ Internet use, though the range  and adoption of new initiatives is now spreading.’ (67)  Therefore, school teachers are those IT professionals that can be most  effective as multipliers in today’s society for broad segments of the population  that will, in their own professional training later, not necessarily themselves  receive privacy/security training but whose actions will determine  privacy/security outcomes: i.e. those pupils who will not become IT  professionals themselves or who will become IT professionals but will only  have a narrow technological focus in their professional context experience.  Main  stakeholders  involved   ECDL Foundation   ISC   SANS   European Schoolnet, eTwinning   National and regional teacher (training) associations  Current status See Section 2.3.  Recommendations for Implementation  Objective: to reduce the gap between the need for NIS security skills in the wider EU society with a  direct intervention on a key target group — school teachers. School teachers are those IT  professionals that can be most effective as multipliers in today’s society for broad segments of the  population. This objective can be achieved by developing appropriate NIS education training  modules targeted at teachers’ needs and competences. We outline how these could be based on  existing modules.  Implementation aspects:   Duration and other factors of context adaptation: The duration of the course could differ  from a standard smaller-scale professional development course spanning one or two full  days to a more in-depth extension of qualification involving weekly meetings of 2-3 hours  over a year or more. The requirements for duration of teacher CPD activities as well as the  incentives given to teachers in the form of recognition for their job requirements, vary  across European countries. We recommend an exploratory questionnaire concerning the  breadth and depth of such a training among the target group in order to determine an  (66) http://eacea.ec.europa.eu/education/eurydice/documents/thematic_reports/121EN.pdf  (67) Livingstone, S, and Haddon, L (2009).

Context adaptation should also take into account the participants’  local legal and cultural context as explained in Section 2.3 of this report.   Continuing Professional Development: Within a teacher’s career, this can be a one-time CPD  activity. This would most likely be the model if the course is of short duration. If the course  is a longer-term qualification and, resources permitting (see ‘basic structure’), it should be  made possible for participants to update their knowledge by re-taking updated individual  modules. In addition, other interested persons can use the online materials.   Specific properties of this course, added value compared to existing offers: As detailed in  Section 2.3, there are a multitude of offers on regional, national and European levels of  materials, lesson plans, etc. for teachers of primary and secondary education on various  notions of ‘(e)safety’, ‘security’, ‘privacy’, etc. However, in spite of individual topics being  covered well, the underlying notion(s) of these terms are often not explained, ethical  assumptions are not questioned and often remain implicit, action orientation remains  limited, and possible conflicts between different notions of ‘security’ (etc.) are neither  identified nor discussed. This leads to fragmented knowledge and skills that are ill-suited to  developing, let alone teaching, comprehensive security knowledge and skills. An additional  shortcoming is that the privacy practices of teachers and schools are rarely discussed,  although these are required for teachers to set a credible example. This course addresses  this challenge by (1) devoting a full module to clarifying and discussing the different notions  of ‘security’ and related terms; (2) including modules on each of these notions; and (3) in  each module, and specifically in the additional module 6 on collaboration and continuing  learning, also addressing teachers’ own practices and possibilities for improving them.  These modules can reuse materials from the existing stock; cf. the mapping between  materials and risk types provided in Section 2.3 and used in the module descriptions.   Training and training the trainers: All modules should help teachers in their own  qualifications but also be a basis for their educational activities. Therefore, participants  should be given ample opportunity to discuss their own teaching practice and to receive  concrete ideas (case studies) as well as concrete materials that they can use or even full  lesson series. Many such examples are included in the overview in Section 2.3.  Curriculum proposal: basic structure: The curriculum consists of six modules. Resources permitting,  modules could be updated and revised in version numbers. Materials of previous instantiations of  the course are made available online.   Module 1: Different notions of ‘security’: safety, e-safety, security, cybersecurity, security  and privacy, IT security and national security, ‘good and bad hackers’, etc.: untangling a  conceptual mess and the inherent as well as the illusory conflicts and trade-offs between  the different notions  o This presents an overview and synopsis of the issues dealt with in modules 2-6, and  invites participants’ reflection and critical discussion of the course structure.   Module 2: ‘Security’ in the sense of ‘protection against inappropriate content and  undesired audiences and contacts’ with a special focus on problems affecting children and  teenagers  o This module focuses on cyber(security) risk types and ‘content risks’ (c.1) and (c.2).  Course participants learn about problems that affect children and adolescents in  particular but not only them (e.g. posting to ‘inappropriate audiences’ and/or sharing  Roadmap for NIS education programmes in Europe  Education  October 2014  Page  18  ‘inappropriate content’). Thus, the learning goal is also digital literacy for adults,  including a reflection on (and possibly change of) one’s own behaviours.  o Recommended specific topics in this module include: content risks, safe searching,  contact risks (cyberbullying, grooming, etc.), and audience management (privacy  settings).   Module 3: ‘Security’ in the sense of ‘protection of personal data and privacy ’  o This module focuses on cybersecurity risk type (c.3). Participants receive a  comprehensive overview of privacy and data protection issues. Technical,  computational, legal, and social aspects are covered with a special focus on helping  participants develop lesson plans tailored to their subject and time constraints.  o Recommended specific topics in this module include: basics of data-based web  business models, interest conflicts between companies and users, tracking and anti- tracking tools and PETs, basics of data mining tasks and methods, data protection  legislation, and practice.   Module 4: ‘Security’ in the sense of ‘IT Security’  o This module focuses on cybersecurity risk type (c.4). Participants learn theoretical  foundations and practical skills. The goal is twofold: first, to learn (and be able to teach)  protection measures for daily life; second, to help course participants create a secure  IT environment at their schools which may include technical as well as social  institutional arrangements. The module also deals with appropriate ways for pupils to  participate in these measures. This module is key in that it shows to pupils, teachers,  and school management that security is not something the individual can achieve  alone. Joint efforts that can lead to ‘security accreditation’ for the school as an  institution are described (68).  o Recommended specific topics in this module include: basic safety measures such as  dealing with passwords, communications and encryption, malware, social engineering  such as phishing, network security, hacking, and secure data management.   Module 5: ‘Security’ in the sense of ‘protection of fundamental rights and democracy’  o This module focuses on cybersecurity risk type (c.5). In this module, the manifold  relationships between IT, security, privacy, and society are discussed.  o Recommended specific topics in this module include: ‘big Data’ and data mining;  informational self-determination and free speech rights, surveillance, and chilling  effects; privacy, transparency, and accountability; and ‘post-privacy’.   Module 6: ‘Security’ in the sense of ‘protection against procrastination’  o In this module, practical skills are introduced and exercised to enhance the  sustainability of learning outcomes.  o Recommended specific topics in this module include: methods for networking (e.g.  joint teaching projects on the European level as supported by etwinning.net or its  national analogues) as well as successful initiatives that foster student-centric learning  (such as recent editions of the Safer Internet Day).  (68) This discussion of accreditation and seals should, however, also discuss failures in the past (e.g. Rifon, N.J., LaRose, R., & Choi, S.M.  (2005). Your privacy is sealed: Effects of web privacy seals on trust and personal disclosures. Journal of Consumer Affairs, (39):339- 362). It should be made clear that security is never perfect and that having a seal or accreditation should not lead to an il lusory sense  of safety.  Roadmap for NIS education programmes in Europe  Education  October 2014  Page  19  Estimated results: School teachers across EU Member States are trained, awareness is raised, and  the level of online safety for young generations is enhanced. Institutional change is encouraged.  There is also potential for having a long-term and lasting impact on the wider EU society in a pan- European perspective.  Means to achieve the goals (didactical elements): A means to implement the curriculum proposal  is the pedagogic perspective of the Communities of Practice in which learners ‘engage in joint  activities and discussions, help each other, and share information. They build relationships that  enable them to learn from each other’. Therefore, learning becomes a social process taking place in  communities of learners that build a shared repertoire of practices: ‘They develop a shared  repertoire of resources: experiences, stories, tools, ways of addressing recurring problems—in short,  a shared practice. This takes time and sustained interaction’ ( 69 ). European platforms such as  etwinning.net could be used to coordinate and support follow-up activities that bring together  teachers, pupils, and other relevant stakeholders from different European countries.  The suggested approach considers offline courses with the target audience (teachers) coming  together (for short or long periods) for a collective learning experience and sharing their  experiences among colleagues, possibly across diverse countries, and learning from each other and  the diverse contexts. This approach could also have a positive impact on the perspective to ‘treat  security education as a global issue’ (70), fostering a pan-European perspective on transferring NIS  education from teachers to pupils.  The practical implementation of this approach focuses on linking (sometimes abstract) concepts  with real-life settings and impact. It includes: lectures for overview and structure; case studies, joint  development of ‘stories’ about privacy + security that structure a lesson series and their  components: informatics-centred exercises, cross-subject exercises, balance between knowledge,  and skills and attitudes development; concrete exercises with participants drawing on techniques  such as programming, data analysis, and role plays; lessons learned from empirical evaluations of  security-related teaching materials such as the adequacy of simulated (rather than authentic)  scenarios, the importance of individual reflection in a domain heavily influenced by peer pressure,  etc. can be used (71).; discussion of existing modules and lesson series and their applicability (or need  for adaptation) in course participants’ teaching practice.  These offline courses can be accompanied by structured collaborations on a platform such as  etwinning.net where teachers already organise joint courses, share their experiences, and carry out  further collaborative projects across borders. These continuing activities are key for ensuring  continuing professional development in the fast-changing area of security/privacy, and they also  embody a blended learning approach (offline courses plus online activities on the teacher platform)  needed for deriving maximum advantage from different media and interaction modi.  Means and incentives for stakeholders: According to a Eurydice report (72), continuing professional  development for teachers has gained importance in Europe and is considered a professional duty  in a majority of Member States. The same report notices that CPD activities could contribute to  promotions and that this is an incentive for teachers to undertake such activities. NISDL training  deliverers can leverage this need for teachers and tailor NISDL modules that would contribute to  (69) Wenger, E. 2007. Communities of Practice. A Brief Introduction.

This is linked with the observation that NIS educational activities for children in  Europe is usually jointly delivered by the ICT teacher and other teachers (73).  As mentioned in Section 2.3, ECDL already addresses teachers with a broader vision to consider  them key actors for a multiplier effect for IT security skills for citizens. This could constitute an  incentive for the creation of a tailored NISDL module for teachers. Furthermore, as noted before,  ECDL already has a module on IT security; this could also constitute a training of interest for the  target audience.  A further incentive for stakeholders relates to education on online safety being widely included in  the school curriculum in several EU Member States (see ‘Target audience’ above). Thus, teachers  can be offered training that they can transfer in their classes, in line with the goal of bringing  security and privacy education to schools.  Evaluation methods and metrics: Evaluation methods should include qualitative and quantitative  aspects. It would be possible to measure the number of school teachers (both in Europe as a whole  and in each Member State) entering CPD activities in the area of NIS education. This could offer  knowledge for targeted actions (in each Member State and in a pan-European perspective). It will  also offer information to stakeholders implementing NIS education modules in terms of where  conduct further targeted interventions and filled market gaps.  Qualitatively, teachers should be offered opportunities for self-assessment both in terms of how  NIS education training contributed to CPD as well as in terms of knowledge and skills acquired. This  will help teachers identify further training needs and opportunities. This evaluation will also offer  relevant information for stakeholders implementing NIS education modules as to where there is a  direct demand and gaps to fill.  To assess the continuing use of materials and activities for self-directed continuing professional  development, learning analytics such as those defined for the eTwinning platform (Berendt et al.,  2013) (74) could be employed.  Participants will also want to think about success metrics for their own courses. One option is to  test knowledge and transfer abilities of pupils by exams (75). Further metrics will be characterised  by an absence: an absence (or reduction) of regrets concerning behaviour in social media (76), an  absence of incidents of cyberbullying among pupils, an absence of hacking attacks on the school’s  infrastructure, etc. Such success metrics are, to the best of our knowledge, not yet existent for  education; measures from IT Security and penetration testing could serve as inspiration.

As such  we propose this scenario/module: “Information Security — Information  Security Management in Practice’, 7, 5 ECTS.  The principal basis for the content of the education is a Swedish framework  (SVISA framework) 77  for the deployment of an information security  management system (ISMS) supplemented with other material from  information security standards (ISO/IEC 27000), regulations, and research.  The SVISA framework was developed by the project SVISA led by the Swedish  Civil Contingency Agency (MSB).  The course is given in 6 blocks of 2 days and, between these blocks, practical  task assignments being conducted at the participants’ regular jobs.  Target audience Participants come from different areas of health care organisations and have  their backgrounds as clinical staff, business analysts, and/or IT professionals.  Main  stakeholders  involved  The course is given by Skövde University, the Computer Science Department,  on behalf of Västra Götaland County in Sweden. One of the course  coordinators is Dr Rose-Mharie Åhlfeld who is an IT security researcher and  university teacher. Also, information security professionals working in the  health care sector of Västra Götaland County have been involved when the  course was designed.  A similar course could also be held by other universities in cooperation with  other health care providers provided that they have a similarly qualified team  consisting of IT security and privacy researchers and IT security professionals  from the health care area.  Recommendations for implementation  Objective and  estimated results  The course has the objective to apply the SVISA framework with the expected  result that participants from the health care sector will gain knowledge and  understanding, skills and abilities, judgment, and an approach to implement  an information security management system (ISMS).  Incentives for  stakeholders  There are special legal requirements for safety, security, and privacy in the  healthcare sector (e.g. pursuant to the Swedish Patient Data Act) as well as  ethical obligations of the medical profession to keep patient data confidential  and safe. In Sweden, there are special incentives for healthcare providers to  have such an educational programme in place with the aim of increasing the  security knowledge and awareness of their clinical staff, business analysts,  and/or IT professionals, and successively establishing a security culture in their  organisations.  77  MSB (2014).

Available:  https://www.informationssakerhet.se/sv/Metodstod/  https://www.informationssakerhet.se/sv/Metodstod/  Roadmap for NIS education programmes in Europe  Education  October 2014  Page  22  Means to achieve  the objective  The course consists of lectures, reports, seminars/group discussions, and  workshops.  It includes an introduction and the following six blocks, including both  theoretical and practical elements: Block 1 — Business analysis, Block 2 — Risk  analysis, Block 3 — Gap analyses, Block 4 — Identify security measures and  processes, Block 5 — Develop and improve guidelines and instructions, Block  6 — Follow up and improve information security.  The theory part is based on standards for the introduction of ISMS (ISO/IEC  27000 family) as well as the latest research in order to provide in-depth  knowledge of the field. The practical part has its basis in the ISMS of the  participants’ working environment in order to practically train them to  implement the management system at the operational level. For this,  students have to conduct and apply practical application assignments  undertaken in the student’s working environment for providing the skills and  ability to apply ISMS in practice.  Metrics  The course examination consists of two parts where the results from the first  three blocks are presented at a seminar at half-time and the remaining data  from blocks 4-6 are presented in the final seminar at the course’s conclusion.  The students also have to submit a final report.  Evaluation  The students were present in the final report to include both reflections about  the course content and design. In the currently ongoing course there are no  written reflections, but the oral feedback so far has been clearly positive. Two  aspects were considered to be particularly valuable: the practical link of the  education with the student’s work and the seminar components where  students get a lot of input and feedback from each other. Furthermore, the  course organisers report that a key success factor of the education has been  the student group composition consisting of professionals from the  healthcare sector with different backgrounds and the motivation for  dedicated, creative discussions that have been extremely valuable and  rewarding.  The observations and comments from the participating parties of the time  that the course was hold were input for a SWOT-Analysis for the course.  Roadmap for NIS education programmes in Europe  Education  October 2014  Page  23  3.1.3 Data Protection Officers Scenario  Data Protection Officer Education  Summary Data Protection Officer Education, 7.5 ECTS.  Data protection officers (DPOs) designated by data controllers or processors  play an important role according to the European Data Protection Legal  Framework.  The proposed EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) requires that  data protection officers, pursuant to Art. 35, shall have expert knowledge of  data protection law and practices, and the ability to fulfil the tasks referred to  in Article 37. This includes the task to ‘monitor the implementation and  application of this Regulation, in particular as to the requirements related to  data protection by design, data protection by default and data security’ as well  as the task to ‘monitor the performance of the data protection impact  assessment by the controller or processor’.  The educational programme proposed here aims to educate lawyers and IT  security specialists on privacy law and privacy technologies for achieving the  qualifications required for data protection officers. Different specialisations  should be offered for lawyers and for information security specialists.  Target audience Students should already have a degree in law or computer science, or a related  subject with an academic and/or practical specialisation in IT security.  Main  stakeholders  involved  This programme can be offered by universities with a research or educational  profile in privacy or other qualified institutes/organisations.  Current status Dedicated programmes for educating data protection officials have already  been offered to Computer Science students by the Hochschule Ulm since the  early 1990s (78).  In addition to this, courses on privacy and privacy-enhancing technologies  (PETs) have been offered by several European universities such as Karlstad  University and the Royal Institute of Technology in Sweden (79), KU Leuven (80),  or other universities (81).  EuroPriSe GmbH offers 2+ days’ of international expert workshops addressing  legal or technical privacy professionals with in-depth knowledge in data  protection and privacy (82). It specifically introduces the EuroPriSe privacy seal  certification scheme, provides training evaluation, and focuses on privacy use  cases with the objective to provide participants with the opportunity to  qualify to become EuroPriSe evaluation experts.

Recommendations for implementation  The objective of the proposed educational programme is to provide lawyers or IT security  specialists with the qualification for becoming or assisting DPOs in organisations handling personal  data. The qualification required for DPOs comprises expertise in both data protection law and  privacy technology. As a result, participants will have knowledge of both domains. They will be able  to evaluate a design or product, highlight problems, and suggest improvements. They will be able  to communicate with other DPOs and experts from both the legal and the IT side.  Means and incentives for stakeholders: Knowledge transfer from universities to industry and  society is gaining increasing importance throughout Europe, not only in the form of joint research  projects but also in the form of training programmes offered for non-university members.  Incentives can be monetary (participation fees), knowledge transfer to society, and also the  knowledge transfer from participants and possible joint follow-up projects. In this way, academics  and practitioners gain new ways of engaging in and shaping societal debates and developments.  Universities that already offer such training events (83) could help others realise this potential by  sharing their expertise on organisation, benefits, and challenges.  The advantages of reciprocal knowledge transfer may be sufficient incentive for voluntary forms of  the proposed course. These may then be offered at irregular intervals within well-suited  environments that are typically non-permanent such as externally funded projects, and/or with  different specialisations in each iteration. If, in contrast, the training events are to offer not only  education and university-based certification of attendance and/or completion, but also an official  certification, they form a new task for universities that will typically go beyond their normal  teaching tasks and capabilities, and additional means and incentives are needed. Public funding  that covers actual costs should be provided to ensure that sufficient and qualified teaching  resources can be devoted to the courses.  Curriculum proposal and means to achieve it (didactical elements): The educational programme  consists of four parts.  The first part, for all participants, offers a basic introduction to privacy and data protection law (incl.  the concepts of privacy, data protection, and related rights and obligations, OECD Privacy  Guidelines, EU Data Protection Directive, EU e-Privacy Directive, GDPR, national data protection  laws as well as the tasks and responsibilities of DPOs, etc.) basic IT security concepts, privacy- enhancing technologies (incl. basic concepts for anonymous communication and application  protocols, anonymisation of databases, and privacy policy languages), Privacy Impact Assessment  and privacy by design.  In the second part, different specialisations are offered for lawyers and IT security specialists. The  legal specialisation will teach more details of privacy legislation and will train the legal evaluation  of systems and products. The technical specialisation provides more technical details of PETs (e.g.  mixes, Tor, blind signatures, zero knowledge proofs, anonymous credentials, k-anonymity and  differential privacy, P3P, PPL, privacy and identity management, transparency, and control tools)  and provides training events on the technical evaluation and certification of PETs.  (83) See the list of courses created by NIS Platform Working Group 3.  Roadmap for NIS education programmes in Europe  Education  October 2014  Page  25  The third part is complementary to the second part: Here, the objective is to teach the two  participant groups an understanding of the other’s conceptualisations. The objective of this part is  a deep understanding of privacy by design (PbD). Care will be taken to highlight typical pitfalls such  as the merely additive combination of data types, transfer, storage, and use from an ‘offline’ version  of the application task with technological safeguards such as encryption. This can be illuminated  with case studies of problematic or even failed PbD such as ELENA, the German Electronic Proof of  Earnings (84). The case studies will serve as important didactical elements in teaching the mixed  audience key elements of the others’ conceptual models of data protection and privacy. The reason  for this is that both designers and critics (such as DPOs with the task of overseeing or auditing a  privacy-by-design process or product) can often determine whether a system truly has ‘privacy built  in’ if they have (a) a formal model of requirements (both of the application task to be solved and of  the privacy requirements), (b) an understanding of the purpose and what its minimal data  requirements are, and (c)  state-of-the-art IT security. (85).  Based on this understanding, the fourth part concludes the programme with practical Privacy  Impact Assessment and privacy by design assignments and a privacy seal evaluation assignment.  Both will be conducted jointly by groups of students with technical and legal backgrounds. The  assignments should include learning methods such as role-plays that are appropriate for also  highlighting the difficulties of conflicting privacy requirements and their treatment in design.  Evaluation methods and metrics: The education programme is passed if the practical assignments  have been solved successfully and an oral or written test has been passed.  Oral and anonymous written course evaluations and reflections by students will be required after  different course elements (i.e. after the introduction, specialisations (part 2) and integration (part  3), and after each assignment).

Roadmap for NIS education programmes in Europe  Education  October 2014  Page  26  3.1.4 Small and Medium Enterprises Scenario  Training for Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs)  Summary Small and medium enterprises (SMEs) have become targets of malicious  online activities and the level of cybercrime faced by SMEs is  increasing ( 86 )  87  ( 88 ). This and the apparent lack of knowledge on and  awareness of the problem, could have a serious impact on the continuing  economic development of the EU — especially as the vast majority of all  European businesses are, in fact, SMEs. Unfortunately, as reported by a recent  workshop on cybersecurity training ( 89 ), private sector companies such as  SMEs, and to a lesser degree public sector organizations, are either unable or  unwilling to fund information assurance and security training. In addition,  those SMEs that are actively looking to improve their knowledge and  understanding of information security are forced down the ISO 270001 route  which, in most cases, is unnecessary and unobtainable. It is this lack of  knowledge, awareness, an over bureaucratic certification process, and of  course the lack of funding that are the key aspects of this problem. The  intention is to develop and deliver (via stakeholders — see below) a low-cost  mini ISO 270001 suitable for the working realities of SMEs.  Target audience SME owners and employees  Main  stakeholders  involved   Academic institutions (e.g. universities, polytechnics, colleges of  further education)   Certification bodies (e.g. IASME, (ISC)2, ISACA, SANS, etc.,)   Regional business associations (e.g. Federation of Small Businesses,  European Business Support Network, etc.,)   Regional development Organisations (e.g. Northumberland  Community Development Network, Association of Regional  Development Agencies, etc.,)   Regional & national government Organisations (e.g. Warning, Advice  & Reporting Points, International Cyber Policy Unit, Information  Commissioner’s Office, ENISA, Action Fraud, etc.,)   NGOs (e.g. Business Crime Reduction Centre, Scottish Business  Resilience Centre, The Analogies Project, Cloud Security Alliance,  etc.,)   Law enforcement agencies (e.g. NCA, Europol, etc.)  Current status This section of the scenario offers a list of materials, initiatives, and training  that illustrate the current status of implementation of this scenario with  regard to the target user (SMEs) in Europe. The list is not exhaustive and is  meant to provide an initial and reasoned overview:   ENISA (90) has developed NIS training material for SMEs  (86) Hayes, J., & Bodhani, A. (2013).

An EUIASME training/standard/certification would  offer a new, easily accessible and sustainable route for SMEs. In essence the EUIASME  standard (following its UK counterpart) will be developed as per the ISO27001 but  specifically tailored for small companies, while still demonstrating baseline compliance with  the international standard.   Encouraging participation: The biggest problems facing acceptance by SMEs, will firstly be  their reticence (it’s just another EU bureaucratic hurdle we have to jump over), and  secondly, how much it will cost. It is suggested that economic incentives for companies (in  (91) https://www.insemot.eu/en/  (92) http://www.isaca.org/Journal/Past-Issues/2012/Volume-6/Documents/12v6-SME-Cybersecurity.pdf  (93) https://www.securingthehuman.org/programs/sme  (94) https://www.sans.org/webcasts/practical-threat-management-incident-response-small-medium-sized-enterprise-98260  (95) www.cpni.gov.uk  (96) https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/cyber-essentials-scheme-overview  (97) https://www.iasme.co.uk/  Roadmap for NIS education programmes in Europe  Education  October 2014  Page  28  the same way as UK government cybersecurity vouchers (98) are used. In addition, there are  a group of SMEs that are required to undertake continuing professional development (CPD  Points). They are lawyers, accountants, solicitors, etc., and CPD points are a mandatory  element of their continuing professional recognition. In addition, this group could also be  considered as ‘enablers’, that is, they also have a client base, which in all probability would  also be SMEs.   Stakeholder incentives: starting from top to bottom:  - Academic institutions: The majority of UK higher education institutions will have  some form of business engagement/outreach programme targeted at local and  regional businesses; offering various business development activities, which will  include SMEs. The incorporation of the information assurance certification would  have added value for business support and development activities.  - The remainder (apart from certification bodies — see below) are all (certainly  within the UK) committed to the cause. This includes regional business associations  because they must be seen doing something, and regional development  organizations, government organizations, and NGO and law enforcement agencies  because they are all ‘on message’ and follow central government directives.  - The certification bodies: All their standards and certifications (CISSP, CISM, and  CISA), have been directed at large national and multi-national organisations.  However, they have recently realized that SMEs represent an untapped and  potentially quite profitable sector. This group represents the key to the success of  the project. If we are able to progress an EU standard (EUIASME) that these  organisations can develop, deliver, and then certify, then I suspect they would only  be too happy to get involved.  Evaluation methods and metrics: A mix of quantitative and qualitative measures  will be used. For example, quantitative metrics could be based on the number of  SMEs undertaking this specific training; in the UK, the Federation of Small Business  (FSB) estimate that 20 % of SMEs have undertaken some form of security training.  This metric could have a further differentiation, e.g. per sector (finance,  manufacturing, etc.), per country and at an EU general level. This will offer  information about the impact of the action and indication where there are gaps  and market needs. In addition, participants could also be offered qualitative  opportunities for self-assessment with further identification of existing gaps and  training opportunities to fill the identified gaps.

In addition, such individuals will need to assist  the organisation in developing a tactical (e.g. incident response) and  strategic approach to the investigation of cyber criminal activities. Such  individuals must also consider the legal, social, and ethical issues when  undertaking an investigation within a work-based environment. Therefore, a  European work-based postgraduate certificate in digital forensics  investigations is proposed — the following sections will outline its structure  and implementation.  Target audience Public & Private Sector Organisations  Main  stakeholders  involved  Academic institutions (e.g. universities, polytechnics, colleges of further  education)  Law enforcement agencies (e.g. NCA, Europol, etc.)  Current status This section of the scenario offers a list of initiatives and training that  illustrate the current status of implementation of this scenario with regard to  the target user in Europe. The list is not exhaustive and is meant to provide  an initial and reasoned overview:  Commercial (Software Vendor) Organisations:  EnCase (99) is a suite of digital forensics developed by Guidance Software that  is designed for digital forensics, cybersecurity, and e-discovery. In addition to  the product, Guidance Software also provides training which can result in the  award of an EnCase Certified Examiner qualification (100). NB This requires  attending classroom sessions.  Access Data (101) also provides vendor specific training on its suite of software  products (e.g. Digital & Mobile Forensics, Litigation & E-Discovery, Cyber  Security). As with EnCase, Access Data also offers Certified Examiner  certification. In addition they also offer academic institutions ‘ready-made’  digital forensics courses.  Commercial (Training Providers) Organisations:  In the UK, companies such as FireBrand (102) offer a number of digital forensics  courses. Again, this requires attendance at classroom sessions. While at an  (99) https://www.guidancesoftware.com/training/Pages/encase-forensic-training-series.aspx?cmpid=nav  (100) https://www.guidancesoftware.com/training/Pages/ence-certification-program.aspx?cmpid=nav  (101) http://www.accessdata.com/  (102) http://www.firebrandtraining.co.uk/courses  Roadmap for NIS education programmes in Europe  Education  October 2014  Page  30  international level, the SANS Institute (103) has a number of digital forensics  certifications (non-vendor specific) ( 104 ). In addition, the SANS Technology  Institute ( 105 ) offers various degrees ( 106 ) in cybersecurity. However, new  enrolments on these programmes are normally limited to 100 per year.  Recommendations for implementation  Objective: to develop a work-based distance learning digital security postgraduate certificate  offered by various academic partners across the EU.  Proposed Curriculum: It is suggested that the programme could make use of the knowledge,  understanding, and/or skills specified by the UK Skills for Justice: National Occupational Standards  (NOS) (107): SFJ CO1: Identify and secure electronic evidence sources, SFJ CO2: Seize and record  electronic evidence sources, SFJ CO3: Capture and preserve electronic evidence, SFJ CO4:  Investigate electronic evidence, SFJ CO5: Evaluate and report electronic evidence, SFJ CO6: Conduct  Internet investigations, SFJ CO7: Conduct network investigations, SFJ CO8: Conduct covert Internet  investigations, SFJ CO9: Take first response actions in investigations involving digitally related  evidence, SFJ CO10: Provide single point of contact services for investigations into digitally related  crime, SFJ CB1: Gather and submit information that has the potential to support policing objectives,  SFJ DB4: Collate and provide papers for individual court/tribunal cases, SEM BIT4: Leading  workplace organisation activities, SEM BIT24: Leading the application of Six Sigma methodology to  a project, SEM BIT27: Leading the application of Six Sigma metrics to a project, SEM BIT29: Leading  the carrying out of capability studies. See Appendix A for NOS Learning Module.  The programme consist of the following modules:  Principles of Digital Forensics Investigations: focusing on the principles and techniques of  identifying and securing electronic evidence sources, including the capture and preservation of  digital evidence. The module will also introduce the types of investigations that can be undertaken,  and how to evaluate and report digital evidence.  Digital Forensics Investigation Strategy: In this module, individuals will evaluate current issues in  digital forensics investigations in the light of their company’s management, strategic, and  operational perspectives after which they will be able to provide a single point of contact when  investigating a digital related crime, take appropriate first responder actions, and prepare all  necessary documentation related to the digital crime.  Workplace Digital Forensics Project: In this module, individuals are required to identify and  successfully lead a workplace digital forensics project. The individual will be accountable for the  development and management of the project, and will ensure that the project provides sufficient  opportunities for personal, professional, and organisational development.  Estimated results: It is anticipated that the enhancement of the technical and business skills of IT  staff will help in raising the general business community’s awareness of cybercrime, and by  improving the conditions for business growth and successes, will ultimately benefit the EU. In  addition, the provision of a formal academic qualification (as opposed to vendor driven  certification) for practitioners will enhance the IT industry sector. Furthermore, the work-based  (103) http://www.sans.org/  (104) http://www.giac.org/certifications/forensics  (105) http://www.sans.edu/  (106) http://www.sans.edu/cyber-security-degrees  (107) http://nos.ukces.org.uk/Pages/index.aspx  Roadmap for NIS education programmes in Europe  Education  October 2014  Page  31  learning approach will help embed expertise into organisations and pull together practitioners  able to disseminate digital forensics intelligence across Europe.  Encouraging participation: Given that the programme is envisaged as being a work-based learning  programme with expert speakers delivering their sessions via e-learning platforms such as  Blackboard or via video streaming and podcasting, participants will not need to take time from their  work. This should prove beneficial to their concerned organisations. In addition, the programme  provides opportunities for participants to develop new and highly relevant technical and  managerial skills, enhancing their career prospects and encouraging their continuing professional  development.  Stakeholder Incentives  Academic institutions: For example, the majority of UK higher education institutions will have  some form of business engagement/outreach programme targeted at local and regional  businesses; offering various business development activities. Assuming that European institutions  have similar programmes, the incorporation of the information assurance certification would  provide added value to business support and development activities.  Law enforcement agencies: Anything that helps to reduce the impact of cybercrime and helps  with the detection and investigation of such activities will be welcomed by the majority of law  enforcement. In addition, we may find that such agencies would also like their own digital  forensics investigators to hold this academic qualification.  Evaluation methods and metrics: A mix of quantitative and qualitative measures will be used. For  example, quantitative metrics could be based on the number of organisations undertaking this  specific training. This metric could have a further differentiation, e.g. per sector (finance,  manufacturing, etc.), per country, and at an EU general level. This will offer information about the  impact of the action and indication where there are gaps and market needs. In addition,  participants could also be offered qualitative opportunities for self-assessment with further  identification of existing gaps and training opportunities to fill the identified gaps.  Roadmap for NIS education programmes in Europe  Education  October 2014  Page  32  3.2 Developing a pilot application on NIS self-assessment  ENISA has developed a self-assessment quiz as part of its NIS education activities. The audience for  this quiz is the broad public and the quiz is intended to combine an entertaining activity with a serious  goal: offer an opportunity for participants to familiarise themselves with some of the key themes of  NIS education and some of the ENISA recommendations, including material developed in recent years  by ENISA through its work. Some questions are also directly connected to the concepts introduced in  the first part of this report.  During the work of the expert team, several models for a quiz and delivery options were considered.  ENISA, together with the experts, agreed that the quiz should be a simple way to measure some of  the participants’ skills related to NIS but should also offer a way for participants to identify knowledge  and skills gaps and offer information on how to bridge these gaps. Furthermore, the experts agreed  that the quiz should contain opportunities for the participant to offer his/her own suggestions. The  quiz, therefore, is not just a way for the public to self-assess some of their skills, but it is also an  opportunity to offer their voice and discuss their own NIS challenges. Therefore, there is a form where  the participants can input their expectations about the quiz at the beginning of it. At the end of the  quiz, a further opportunity asking what could have been done differently is offered to participants.  This material will, at a later stage, be analysed and assist ENISA in its activities in the NIS education  area for the general public, including improving the existing quiz and the development of further  quizzes. Following the input form, at the beginning of the quiz, participants are required to select their  level of confidence about NIS: from low to medium to high level. Depending on the initial choice the  quiz offers increasingly more difficult questions for testing own skills and knowledge.  10 Narratives with questions or dilemmas  3 answers are presented for each question  Participants answer the question & receive  immediate feedback  Selection of skills level (Low, medium, high)  Participant’s  Feedback  A profile is generated  Roadmap for NIS education programmes in Europe  Education  October 2014  Page  33  The quiz contains 10 NIS questions and in total, together with input forms, it should take  approximately 10 minutes to complete. Each question starts with a short narrative and then a dilemma  or a direct question. For each answer (either correct or not) there is then a short  explanation/discussion with some further suggestions.  A profile will be generated based on the  overall result of the quiz. The profile can be one of the following:  1. Beginner: with limited number of correct answers. This profile signals limited level of skills or  knowledge of NIS (according to the quiz and the difficulty level selected by the participant).  2. Intermediate: good number of correct answers. This profile has a reasonable level of skills  and knowledge of NIS (according to the quiz and the difficulty level selected by the  participant).  3. Advanced: high number of correct answers. This profile has an excellent level of skills and  knowledge of NIS (according to quiz and the difficulty level selected by the participant).  For each generated profile further indications are being offered in terms of documentation and  material to consult with particular attention to ENISA reports. At the low and medium levels there is  also the suggestion for attempting the next confidence level quiz.  The application is available on the website www.cybersecuritymonth.eu from October 2014 as a pilot  with a possibility of renewal after the first evaluation.  Existing Self-Assessment Quiz  Some of the NIS education stakeholders offer self-assessment quizzes. In most cases they are intended  as preparation tests for certifications (e.g. CISM, CISA) or modules (ECDL IT Security). Therefore, they  have different goals compared to the ENISA NIS quiz which has a more general goal of signalling  relevance of certain subjects and to make relevant suggestions. The following is a list of the existing  relevant NIS self-assessment quizzes offered by the stakeholders:   ISACA — CISM-CISA Self-Assessment Exam (108): ISACA has a self-assessment quiz (multiple-  choice) whose goal is to prepare candidates for the certification exams.- The self-assessment  is made against the learning material and it is meant to be used in preparation for the exam.   ECDL IT Security Module (109): ECDL Foundation has a sample test (multiple-choice) for self-  assessment and the IT Security Module. The quiz allows testing knowledge about the  content for the ECDL IT Security Module.   ISC (studlSCOPE): Has a test that allows ‘enabling security staffs and individuals to assess  their knowledge of the (ISC) ² CBK®, taxonomy of information security topics that serves as  the foundation for all (ISC) ² certifications’ (110).   SANS Cyber Talent Skill Assessment Quiz: This quiz measures skills against the ‘Global  Information Assurance Certification (GIAC). SANS Cyber Talent Assessments can provide  benchmarks across many information security domains including communications security,  internet security, networking concepts and operating systems security’ (111).

Consequently, this lack of standard usage may limit the ability of  teachers to understand, explore, and hence teach cybersecurity basics in a structured manner,  resulting in lesson plans becoming a collection of ‘do’s and don’ts’, that do not support deep  learning and any form of reflection on that learning by the student. By deploying better  continuing education programmes for teachers we advocate for enhancing the multiplier role  they have. The scenario presented suggests an intervention on this specific target group  whose multiplier role means having increased capacities in terms of transferable NIS  education skills that could have a wide and lasting impact on EU Society and its citizens.   Massive Online Open Courses (MOOCs) may offer opportunities for the distance learning  delivery of network and information security modules to large audiences. Furthermore, this  approach could be easily adopted by interested stakeholders. Consequently, it is felt that  more emphasis should be placed on NIS and that European Institutions should start to develop  NIS MOOCs. In addition, any future pan-European MOOC initiatives should consider including  ‘NIS for Dummies’ modules within the programmes portfolio. To sum up, we advocate for:  more NIS MOOCs developed by European organisations over ‘traditional’ platforms where, at  the moment, most of them are developed by U.S. universities; that pan-European MOOC  initiatives should consider basic NIS modules in their portfolio.   By developing a course for health practitioners, participants from the health care sector could  gain knowledge and understanding, skills and abilities, judgment, and an approach to  implement an information security management system (ISMS).   For IT-security educational programmes for practitioners:  o There should be a practical link of the education with the participants’ work and  the security challenges that the participants face at their work places. Especially  practical assignments during this course should be designed accordingly to  address this requirement.  o It is also beneficial to have seminar discussions with groups consisting of  students coming from different disciplines and having different professional  backgrounds, representing people that typically should cooperate in  implementing security and creating a security culture in an organisation.   The development of the Data Protection Officers (DPOs) course directed at lawyers and digital  security specialists would help ensure that both groups have an understanding of data  protection laws and privacy technologies. Since participants will have knowledge of both  domains, technical specialists will be better able to evaluate a design or product, highlight  problems, and suggest improvements from a legal perspective, while a lawyer may be able to  do the same, but from a technical perspective.   The development of an EU information assurance training/education solution for the working  realities of SMEs may prove extremely useful in the fight against cybercriminal activities  directed at European SMEs.   The rising increases of digital crime directed at European private and public organisations  suggest that EU organisations require individuals skilled in digital forensics investigations and  the collection and presentation of digital evidence of the crime. The development of an EU-  Roadmap for NIS education programmes in Europe  Education  October 2014  Page  35  based academic recognition for continuing professional development in digital forensics may  help in the provision of those skilled investigators.  Furthermore, we invite the reader to consult the tools developed through this project:  1. The interactive map with NIS courses in Europe available on  www.cybersecuritymonth.eu compiled by the NIS Platform WG3 group. One can also add a  new reference simply by using the ‘ADD’ button.  2. NIS quiz addressed to all users for knowledge update, available on  www.cybersecuritymonth.eu.  As a final conclusion the authors suggest the idea of creating a Europass (112) for NIS Skills for the  general public, very much in line with the model of the Europass Language Passport (113). Skills can be  self-assessed for certain NIS areas (e.g. privacy, general security) and according to an established self- assessment frame. A ‘NIS Europass’ could facilitate, for example, jobseekers in applying for jobs across  Europe and could facilitate employers in assessing prospective candidates. Clearly the development  of this passport will require appropriate research and the need to work directly with key stakeholders  delivering NIS education for the public, work to be followed in the future by interested organisations.

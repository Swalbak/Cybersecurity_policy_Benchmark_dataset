Introduction  Nowadays electronic communication networks and digital services are an essential part of an increasing  number of everyday commodities. In the era of automated profiling and electronic surveillance, citizens  face a serious threat against their right to privacy and informational self-determination, especially when  using the internet and mobile services. The lack of transparency regarding the functionality and intercon- nection of such services increases the risk of uncontrollable processing of personal data. In this regard, the  upcoming Data Protection Regulation will be a useful instrument to protect the privacy of individuals.  However, for its successful implementation, this new framework needs to be enforced by proper technolo- gies and encompassed with sustainable business models along with mechanisms to promote privacy  awareness and help users to understand the value of their data.  In light of the data protection regulation and the European digital agenda, DG CONNECT, EDPS, ENISA and,  Goethe University Frankfurt organized APF 2016 (http://privacyforum.eu/). APF 2016 was held 7 & 8 Sep- tember at Goethe University Frankfurt am Main, Germany. The event encouraged dialog with key note  speakers, panel discussions, and provided room for exchange of ideas in between scientific sessions. The  proceedings, LNCS 98571, are available online; a print version was distributed to relevant stakeholders  (participants and management board).  There conference was attended by more than 100 registered participants.  1 http://link.springer.com/book/10.1007%2F978-3-319-44760-5  http://link.springer.com/book/10.1007%2F978-3-319-44760-5  Annual Privacy Forum 2016  October 2016  05  2. Programme  Invited talks  Three speakers from industry were invited, namely Thomas Kremer, Deutsche Telekom AG, Mikko Hyppo- nen, F-Secure, and Jacoba Sieders ABN AMRO Bank. Keynotes aimed to fuel the discussion from a practical  perspective, while the closing note aimed to give home work to researchers and policy makers. The invited  speakers are listed below.  Dr. Thomas Kremer has been the Board of Management member responsible  for Data Privacy, Legal Affairs and Compliance at Deutsche Telekom AG since  June 2012. He was the interim Chief Human Resources Officer from January  2014 to March 2015.  Previously, he worked for ThyssenKrupp AG where he became General Counsel  of the holdings' legal department in 2003, and Chief Compliance Officer of the  ThyssenKrupp Group in 2007. In 2009, Thomas Kremer assumed leadership of  the newly formed Corporate Center Legal & Compliance. He was appointed Executive Vice President (Gen- eralbevollmächtigter) in 2011.  In addition to his experience in industry, Thomas Kremer worked as a research assistant at the University  of Bonn, where he gained a doctorate in law in 1994. Moreover, he is engaged in the governmental com- mission German Corporate Governance Codex (Deutscher Corporate Governance Kodex DCGK). Since No- vember 2015 he is chairman of the network safety association \"Deutschland sicher im Netz\" (Making Ger- many safe on the Net  Mikko Hypponen is the Chief Research Officer of F-Secure. He's been with the  company since 1991.  Mr. Hypponen has written on his research for the New York Times, Wired and  Scientific America and he appears frequently on international TV. He has lec- tured at the universities of Stanford and Cambridge and he has delivered the  most watched computer security talk on the internet.  Mr. Hypponen is a member of the board of the Nordic Business Forum and a member of the advisory  board of T2.  Jacoba Sieders. As executive within the ABN AMRO Corporate Information Security Office,  Jacoba has final accountability for digital identity and the online and mobile access control for  customers, employees and partners for the bank’s data and infrastructure. Next to that she  holds the research and innovation portfolio for the domain. Since seventeen years she has  been running security and identity management in three major global banks, and she is experi- enced in designing data protection frameworks and governance from the security and identity  perspective. Today’s main topics on her agenda are API banking, data centric security, identity  management for block chain and hybrid clouds, inter-bank identity programs, the Payment  Services Directive II requirements, and the new concepts for authentication which ABN AMRO is develop- ing. Jacoba is a member of the advisory board of the independent European think-tank ID-Next and is regu- larly peaking on the topic.  Annual Privacy Forum 2016  October 2016  06  Panels  The 3 panels aimed to promote ENISA’s projects. With APF late in the year, they could be seen as a first  peer review of the relevant projects. However, since we want to move APF to an earlier time of the year, in  the future panel discussions will evolve more into kick-off or brain storming discussions nevertheless  tightly coupled to ENISA WP activities. Moreover, they could be used to aim for a more multiannual strat- egy, evaluating past years projects and collecting ideas for how to continue a certain work stream.  2.2.1 Online privacy tools for the general public  It is widely recognised that one of the most serious concerns today is the preservation of privacy when us- ing internet and mobile applications. This concern has given rise to an increasing appearance of online  tools, often open-source and/or freeware, affirming that they can offer certain privacy-preventive func- tionality, such as for example secure communication, encryption, protection against tracking, anonymous  browsing, etc. However, in many cases the functionality of such tools is not as expected, for example due  to lack of transparency on the tool’s development and operation or lack of proper maintenance mecha- nisms. Privacy enhancing technologies (PETs) that fail to offer what they promise can be very dangerous, as  the false sense of protection can compromise the users’ personal data and negatively affect or even out in  harm’s way their personal life.  Against this background, ENISA has been engaged over the last years in the development and practical im- plementation of a systematic approach for the assessment and presentation of online privacy tools for the  general public (the PETs control matrix). Starting from the aforementioned work, the scope of this panel is  to examine the availability of reliable online privacy tools today, the information that is provided to end  users, the potential of self-assessment of privacy tools (by PETs developers), as well as the level of aware- ness of web and mobile users on PETs.  2.2.2 Appropriate security measures for the processing of personal data  Information risk management is an integral part of an organization’s management process that deals with  the identification, treatment, communication and acceptance of IT security risks. It involves the selection  and implementation of measures justified by the identified risks and the reduction of those risks to ac- ceptable levels. It also comprises continuous monitoring of risks and risk communication. Several method- ologies and frameworks have been proposed and have been adopted by organizations during the last dec- ade but none of them was oriented on the protection of personal data.  Under the European legal framework, personal data can only be collected under specific conditions, for a  legitimate purpose. Furthermore, organisations which collect, process and store personal data must pro- tect it from misuse and they are obliged to ensure that technical and organisational measures are under- taken so as to protect the personal data with an appropriate level of security. Data subjects should have  the same level of protection, regardless of the size of the organisation or the amount of personal data it  processes. In 2014, Article 29 Data Protection Working Party has acknowledged that this protection can be  done on in a scalable manner and has issued a statement on the role of a risk-based approach in data pro- tection legal frameworks.  Such a risk-based approach should enable organizations to identify and assess the risks, likelihood and im- pact, and prioritize the events that could compromise the integrity and confidentiality of personal data.  Following the risk assessment, it should also support organizations to select appropriate security and or- ganizational measures and control to mitigate the identified risks, the potential impact and reduce the  probability of occurrence.  Annual Privacy Forum 2016  October 2016  07  2.2.3 Developing and maintaining a PET maturity repository  In recent years ENISA contributed to the definition of privacy and security by design, i.e. answering the  question what the practical implications of these terms are. In the course of this work, ENISA developed a  methodology that allows to compare different Privacy Enhancing Technologies (PETs) with regard to their  maturity, i.e., their technology readiness and their quality concerning the provided privacy notion. This  methodology was turned into a structured process and a community tool was developed.  The panel presented this tool for the first time to a wider expert public. Further, we discussed possibilities  on how such a repository can be build and maintained  Scientific track  As in previous years, half of the conference agenda was dedicated to presentations of new ideas from re- search. To identify these new ideas, a call for papers was published in February 2016. This call was adver- tised by the programme committee (PC) members and published at relevant platforms, e.g. wiki-CfP2. The  PC presented in section A.1.2 was composed of 50 senior academics, about 30% legal and 70% technical  experts (computer science, electrical engineering). The review was single blind (reviewer knew authors,  but authors did not know their reviewer) and a conflict of interest policy was enforced: a CoI was consid- ered if reviewer and author were 1) academic siblings, 2) co-authors in the last 2 years or 3) in economic  dependency from each other. The submission process was supported by EasyChair3.  We received 32 submissions in response to our call for papers, see appendix. Each paper was peer-re- viewed by at least four members of the international programme committee. Based on significance, nov- elty and scientific quality, we selected six full research papers. In order to support less experienced re- searchers, an additional seven papers were selected to undergo shepherding, i.e. a PC member was in  close contact with the authors advising how to improve the paper. Six papers of those seven eventually  met our quality standards and accepted for presentation and publication.  The first session, eIDAS and Data Protection regulation, discussed topics concerning data life cycle agree- ments, processes for privacy impact assessment and electronic IDs in a policy and organizational context.  The second session, IoT and Public Clouds, discussed privacy and legal aspects in IoT, Cloud computing and  their associated technological domains. Finally, the third session, Privacy Policies and Privacy Risk Repre- sentation, took the user on board, discussing privacy indicators to better communicate to users privacy  policies and potential privacy risks. The proceedings, LNCS 9857, are available online.  2 http://www.wikicfp.com/cfp/  3 http://easychair.org/  http://www.wikicfp.com/cfp/ http://easychair.org/  Annual Privacy Forum 2016  October 2016  08  3. Cooperation agreement and other practical arrangements  As legal basis, we set up a cooperation agreement with the local co-organizer, which essentially stated that  ENISA will cover loses of the local co-organizer up to 20k. Cost above this limit need to be covered by fees  and sponsorships.  The conference fee was set at euro 400, and discounted for early bird registration to Euro 250 and Euro  200 for students.  This year’s search for sponsors was less successful than other years. We acquired 2 sponsors: one trust and  the USEMP project, both contributing up to Euro 2000. The fact that we signed a MoU with f-secure was an  inhibiting factor for other sponsors, thus we would expect more success in the following years.  Over all, with planning well in advance, we would expect that APF could be transformed into a self-sustain- ing event, with costs covered by fees and sponsorship.  Annual Privacy Forum 2016  October 2016  09  4. Conclusion and Recommendations  In conclusion, the 4th incarnation of the annual privacy forum was a full success. Nevertheless, there is al- ways room for improvement. Hence, we recommend for future APF   Early planning. is crucial for call for papers, keynotes and advertisement. The next conference and  local organiser should be announced at closure of the event, the call for papers should be online  not later than 10 month before the event. Hence, best-suited project life cycle is about 13 months,  with early partnerships set between European institutions, local organisers and sponsors. We  strongly advice multiannual planning.   Keep the CfP. The paper track makes the event more interesting for industry participants. From  their feedback, we know that they come for two reasons. Firstly to meet the policy makers and  secondly to hunt for new talent.   Multi-disciplinary approach. Compared to earlier APFs, in 2016 the APF was reaching out to indus- try (key notes) and to the legal community (30% of PC from law schools). However, there is still  room for improvement. A stronger involvement of others discipline needs to be encouraged. We  advise to invite a legal expert to the PC chair and to consider cooperating with other agencies, e.g.  FRA.   Financial model. APF could become self-sustainable. It would be recommendable to explore how  sponsors could be better involved.   Location. A co-organizer with its own conference facilities is highly recommendable.   Date. The conference date needs to be selected careful. Especial competing events such as  ESORICS, PETS, INFO Hiding need to be considered.

The lack of transparency regarding the functionality and intercon- nection of such services increases the risk of uncontrollable processing of personal data. In this regard, the  upcoming Data Protection Regulation will be a useful instrument to protect the privacy of individuals.  However, for its successful implementation, this new framework needs to be enforced by proper technolo- gies and encompassed with sustainable business models along with mechanisms to promote privacy  awareness and help users to understand the value of their data.  The 2016 edition of the annual privacy forum is organized in the light of the upcoming data protection reg- ulation and the European digital agenda. We invite papers covering original work on the technological,  economic, legal and societal aspects of the challenges that will come up with the implementation of the  new framework. We particularly invite multidisciplinary papers that make it explicit how the presented  work can contribute to bridging the gap between research and policy.  To encourage contributions from policy makers, representatives of competent authorities (such as Data  Protection Authorities), industry experts, NGOs, and civil society associations, we also invite opinion pa- pers from all stakeholders on the above mentioned topics. Opinion papers will reflect the opinion/position  of the author(s) on the selected privacy-related topic.   Implementation aspects of ‘by design’ and 'by default' paradigms   Implementation and adoption of PETs in today’s digital services   Modelling of data protection and privacy requirements, such as: machine readable representations  and automatic evaluation of policies   Enabling transparency: technological and organizational challenges.   Technical solutions for the enforcement and the implications of the subject’s right, e.g. right to  erasure, access and correction.   Aspects of privacy impact and risk assessment   Technical solutions for data portability   Sustainable business models for privacy friendly online services   Information and consent in online environments: practical solutions and implementations   Privacy awareness, reliability and usability of PETs   Trust services for the protection of personal data - privacy aware trust services (i.e. electronic cer- tificates, signatures, etc.)   Security measures for the protection of personal data   Economics of privacy and personal data  All submissions will be thoroughly reviewed by our PC members. We aim at minimal 3 average 4 reviews  per paper. Furthermore, papers will be published in the proceedings of the conference, which will appear  in Springer’s LNCS series  Annual Privacy Forum 2016  October 2016  11  A.1.2 Programme Committee  General Co chairs  Prof. Dr. Kai Rannenberg, Goethe University Frankfurt  Dr. Demosthenes Ikonomou, ENISA, Athens  Scientific Program Committee Chairs  Dr. Jetzabel Serna, Goethe University Frankfurt  Dr. Stefan Schiffner ENISA, Athens  Program Committee  Sven Wohlgemuth, Independent Consultant  Bernhard C.

As executive within the ABN AMRO Corporate Information Security Office,  Jacoba has final accountability for digital identity and the online and mobile access control for  customers, employees and partners for the bank’s data and infrastructure. Next to that she  holds the research and innovation portfolio for the domain. Since seventeen years she has  been running security and identity management in three major global banks, and she is experi- enced in designing data protection frameworks and governance from the security and identity  perspective. Today’s main topics on her agenda are API banking, data centric security, identity  management for block chain and hybrid clouds, inter-bank identity programs, the Payment  Services Directive II requirements, and the new concepts for authentication which ABN AMRO is develop- ing. Jacoba is a member of the advisory board of the independent European think-tank ID-Next and is regu- larly peaking on the topic.  Annual Privacy Forum 2016  October 2016  06  Panels  The 3 panels aimed to promote ENISA’s projects. With APF late in the year, they could be seen as a first  peer review of the relevant projects. However, since we want to move APF to an earlier time of the year, in  the future panel discussions will evolve more into kick-off or brain storming discussions nevertheless  tightly coupled to ENISA WP activities. Moreover, they could be used to aim for a more multiannual strat- egy, evaluating past years projects and collecting ideas for how to continue a certain work stream.  2.2.1 Online privacy tools for the general public  It is widely recognised that one of the most serious concerns today is the preservation of privacy when us- ing internet and mobile applications. This concern has given rise to an increasing appearance of online  tools, often open-source and/or freeware, affirming that they can offer certain privacy-preventive func- tionality, such as for example secure communication, encryption, protection against tracking, anonymous  browsing, etc. However, in many cases the functionality of such tools is not as expected, for example due  to lack of transparency on the tool’s development and operation or lack of proper maintenance mecha- nisms. Privacy enhancing technologies (PETs) that fail to offer what they promise can be very dangerous, as  the false sense of protection can compromise the users’ personal data and negatively affect or even out in  harm’s way their personal life.  Against this background, ENISA has been engaged over the last years in the development and practical im- plementation of a systematic approach for the assessment and presentation of online privacy tools for the  general public (the PETs control matrix). Starting from the aforementioned work, the scope of this panel is  to examine the availability of reliable online privacy tools today, the information that is provided to end  users, the potential of self-assessment of privacy tools (by PETs developers), as well as the level of aware- ness of web and mobile users on PETs.  2.2.2 Appropriate security measures for the processing of personal data  Information risk management is an integral part of an organization’s management process that deals with  the identification, treatment, communication and acceptance of IT security risks. It involves the selection  and implementation of measures justified by the identified risks and the reduction of those risks to ac- ceptable levels. It also comprises continuous monitoring of risks and risk communication. Several method- ologies and frameworks have been proposed and have been adopted by organizations during the last dec- ade but none of them was oriented on the protection of personal data.  Under the European legal framework, personal data can only be collected under specific conditions, for a  legitimate purpose. Furthermore, organisations which collect, process and store personal data must pro- tect it from misuse and they are obliged to ensure that technical and organisational measures are under- taken so as to protect the personal data with an appropriate level of security. Data subjects should have  the same level of protection, regardless of the size of the organisation or the amount of personal data it  processes. In 2014, Article 29 Data Protection Working Party has acknowledged that this protection can be  done on in a scalable manner and has issued a statement on the role of a risk-based approach in data pro- tection legal frameworks.  Such a risk-based approach should enable organizations to identify and assess the risks, likelihood and im- pact, and prioritize the events that could compromise the integrity and confidentiality of personal data.  Following the risk assessment, it should also support organizations to select appropriate security and or- ganizational measures and control to mitigate the identified risks, the potential impact and reduce the  probability of occurrence.  Annual Privacy Forum 2016  October 2016  07  2.2.3 Developing and maintaining a PET maturity repository  In recent years ENISA contributed to the definition of privacy and security by design, i.e. answering the  question what the practical implications of these terms are. In the course of this work, ENISA developed a  methodology that allows to compare different Privacy Enhancing Technologies (PETs) with regard to their  maturity, i.e., their technology readiness and their quality concerning the provided privacy notion. This  methodology was turned into a structured process and a community tool was developed.  The panel presented this tool for the first time to a wider expert public. Further, we discussed possibilities  on how such a repository can be build and maintained  Scientific track  As in previous years, half of the conference agenda was dedicated to presentations of new ideas from re- search. To identify these new ideas, a call for papers was published in February 2016. This call was adver- tised by the programme committee (PC) members and published at relevant platforms, e.g. wiki-CfP2. The  PC presented in section A.1.2 was composed of 50 senior academics, about 30% legal and 70% technical  experts (computer science, electrical engineering). The review was single blind (reviewer knew authors,  but authors did not know their reviewer) and a conflict of interest policy was enforced: a CoI was consid- ered if reviewer and author were 1) academic siblings, 2) co-authors in the last 2 years or 3) in economic  dependency from each other. The submission process was supported by EasyChair3.  We received 32 submissions in response to our call for papers, see appendix. Each paper was peer-re- viewed by at least four members of the international programme committee. Based on significance, nov- elty and scientific quality, we selected six full research papers. In order to support less experienced re- searchers, an additional seven papers were selected to undergo shepherding, i.e. a PC member was in  close contact with the authors advising how to improve the paper. Six papers of those seven eventually  met our quality standards and accepted for presentation and publication.  The first session, eIDAS and Data Protection regulation, discussed topics concerning data life cycle agree- ments, processes for privacy impact assessment and electronic IDs in a policy and organizational context.  The second session, IoT and Public Clouds, discussed privacy and legal aspects in IoT, Cloud computing and  their associated technological domains. Finally, the third session, Privacy Policies and Privacy Risk Repre- sentation, took the user on board, discussing privacy indicators to better communicate to users privacy  policies and potential privacy risks. The proceedings, LNCS 9857, are available online.  2 http://www.wikicfp.com/cfp/  3 http://easychair.org/  http://www.wikicfp.com/cfp/ http://easychair.org/  Annual Privacy Forum 2016  October 2016  08  3. Cooperation agreement and other practical arrangements  As legal basis, we set up a cooperation agreement with the local co-organizer, which essentially stated that  ENISA will cover loses of the local co-organizer up to 20k. Cost above this limit need to be covered by fees  and sponsorships.  The conference fee was set at euro 400, and discounted for early bird registration to Euro 250 and Euro  200 for students.  This year’s search for sponsors was less successful than other years. We acquired 2 sponsors: one trust and  the USEMP project, both contributing up to Euro 2000. The fact that we signed a MoU with f-secure was an  inhibiting factor for other sponsors, thus we would expect more success in the following years.  Over all, with planning well in advance, we would expect that APF could be transformed into a self-sustain- ing event, with costs covered by fees and sponsorship.  Annual Privacy Forum 2016  October 2016  09  4. Conclusion and Recommendations  In conclusion, the 4th incarnation of the annual privacy forum was a full success. Nevertheless, there is al- ways room for improvement. Hence, we recommend for future APF   Early planning. is crucial for call for papers, keynotes and advertisement. The next conference and  local organiser should be announced at closure of the event, the call for papers should be online  not later than 10 month before the event. Hence, best-suited project life cycle is about 13 months,  with early partnerships set between European institutions, local organisers and sponsors. We  strongly advice multiannual planning.   Keep the CfP. The paper track makes the event more interesting for industry participants. From  their feedback, we know that they come for two reasons. Firstly to meet the policy makers and  secondly to hunt for new talent.   Multi-disciplinary approach. Compared to earlier APFs, in 2016 the APF was reaching out to indus- try (key notes) and to the legal community (30% of PC from law schools). However, there is still  room for improvement. A stronger involvement of others discipline needs to be encouraged. We  advise to invite a legal expert to the PC chair and to consider cooperating with other agencies, e.g.  FRA.   Financial model. APF could become self-sustainable. It would be recommendable to explore how  sponsors could be better involved.   Location. A co-organizer with its own conference facilities is highly recommendable.   Date. The conference date needs to be selected careful. Especial competing events such as  ESORICS, PETS, INFO Hiding need to be considered.  Annual Privacy Forum 2016  October 2016  10  Annex A: Example of Annex  Call for Papers  A.1.1 Call text  Nowadays electronic communication networks and digital services are an essential part of an increasing  number of everyday commodities. In the era of automated profiling and electronic surveillance, citizens  face a serious threat against their right to privacy and informational self-determination, especially when  using the internet and mobile services. The lack of transparency regarding the functionality and intercon- nection of such services increases the risk of uncontrollable processing of personal data. In this regard, the  upcoming Data Protection Regulation will be a useful instrument to protect the privacy of individuals.  However, for its successful implementation, this new framework needs to be enforced by proper technolo- gies and encompassed with sustainable business models along with mechanisms to promote privacy  awareness and help users to understand the value of their data.  The 2016 edition of the annual privacy forum is organized in the light of the upcoming data protection reg- ulation and the European digital agenda. We invite papers covering original work on the technological,  economic, legal and societal aspects of the challenges that will come up with the implementation of the  new framework. We particularly invite multidisciplinary papers that make it explicit how the presented  work can contribute to bridging the gap between research and policy.  To encourage contributions from policy makers, representatives of competent authorities (such as Data  Protection Authorities), industry experts, NGOs, and civil society associations, we also invite opinion pa- pers from all stakeholders on the above mentioned topics. Opinion papers will reflect the opinion/position  of the author(s) on the selected privacy-related topic.   Implementation aspects of ‘by design’ and 'by default' paradigms   Implementation and adoption of PETs in today’s digital services   Modelling of data protection and privacy requirements, such as: machine readable representations  and automatic evaluation of policies   Enabling transparency: technological and organizational challenges.   Technical solutions for the enforcement and the implications of the subject’s right, e.g. right to  erasure, access and correction.   Aspects of privacy impact and risk assessment   Technical solutions for data portability   Sustainable business models for privacy friendly online services   Information and consent in online environments: practical solutions and implementations   Privacy awareness, reliability and usability of PETs   Trust services for the protection of personal data - privacy aware trust services (i.e. electronic cer- tificates, signatures, etc.)   Security measures for the protection of personal data   Economics of privacy and personal data  All submissions will be thoroughly reviewed by our PC members. We aim at minimal 3 average 4 reviews  per paper. Furthermore, papers will be published in the proceedings of the conference, which will appear  in Springer’s LNCS series  Annual Privacy Forum 2016  October 2016  11  A.1.2 Programme Committee  General Co chairs  Prof. Dr. Kai Rannenberg, Goethe University Frankfurt  Dr. Demosthenes Ikonomou, ENISA, Athens  Scientific Program Committee Chairs  Dr. Jetzabel Serna, Goethe University Frankfurt  Dr. Stefan Schiffner ENISA, Athens  Program Committee  Sven Wohlgemuth, Independent Consultant  Bernhard C.

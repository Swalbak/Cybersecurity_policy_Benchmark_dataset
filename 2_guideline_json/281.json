The 5G technology profile gives  additional guidance to competent national authorities about how to ensure the security of 5G  networks. This document was developed in close collaboration with experts from national  telecom security authorities across the EU, i.e. the ECASEC Expert Group (formerly known as  the Article 13a Expert Group), and with the members of the NIS CG work stream for 5G  cybersecurity.  Figure 1: Structure of the ENISA Guideline on Security Measures under the EECC  Considering the dynamic nature of 5G technology and the related threat landscape, this  document is meant to be updated as technology and risks evolve. ENISA may consider using  an alternative electronic format for this supplementary guideline, to better support regular  updates.  1.1 OBJECTIVES AND SCOPE  The objective of this document is to provide additional guidance for competent authorities on  how to ensure that appropriate security measures are taken by providers of 5G networks and  services. This supplement clarifies and refines the more generic security measures in the  Guideline on Security Measures under the EECC specifically for 5G technology.  Considering the complexity of 5G technology and the variety of deployment and configuration  options, both the risks and the necessary security measures will be very different for different  deployments of 5G networks and services. This means that it is important to assess the setup  and the security in depth, for each case, for example by performing audits2 on MNOs.  1 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/guideline-on-security-measures-under-the-eecc  2 This scope of this supplement does not include full audit guidelines for 5G networks, but competent authorities may refer  to the general guidance for auditing communication service providers given in the section 5.6 of the Guideline.  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/guideline-on-security-measures-under-the-eecc  5G SUPPLEMENT  July 2021  6  1.2 POLICY CONTEXT  The Guideline, and this supplement, is a guideline for national authorities with competence on  Article 40 of the EECC.  The Guideline, and this supplement, also addresses Supporting action SA01 of the Union  toolbox of mitigating measures for 5G. It also gives guidance to EU Member States about the  technical security measures under the Toolbox, in particular TM01. References to other  technical measures that may be fully or partially implemented through the implementation of the  measures in the Guideline and this supplement are provided further in this supplement.  1.3 STRUCTURE OF THIS DOCUMENT  This document is structured as follows:  Section 2 contains the necessary background, i.e. a short introduction to cybersecurity of 5G  networks, summarizing the outcomes of the coordinated EU approach for the cybersecurity of  5G networks, listing the critical assets, and key risks identified in the Union-wide risk  assessment and summarizing what is in the EU toolbox on 5G cybersecurity.  Section 3 contains the 5G technology profile which provides supplementary guidance to national  authorities on what are the appropriate security measures for 5G networks. The profile contains  short general guidance and specific guidance for each of the 8 security domains in the  Guideline.  Finally, in Section 4 we briefly discuss some specific technological aspects of 5G networks that  are of particular interest from the cybersecurity point of view. For each of the key technologies  we provide information or references to relevant industry standards and best practices that  competent authorities may want to take in consideration.  1.4 VERSIONS AND CHANGES  ENISA updates the Guideline and this supplement periodically, when necessary, in agreement  with the competent authorities.  This second version of the supplement constitutes a minor update to the initial version  published on 10 December 2020. This update to the supplement has been done in parallel with  an update to the Guideline (now 4th edition).  Main changes in the second version of the supplement:   In line with the 4th edition of the Guideline, updated the name of Security Objective 4 to  ‘Security of third-party dependencies’   Additional security check no. 26 added to Security Objective 14   Amended evidence mapping in Table 13: ‘Additional guidance checklist for domain D6’  5G SUPPLEMENT  July 2021  7  BACKGROUND: 5G RISKS  AND MEASURES  2.1 COORDINATED EU APPROACH TO CYBERSECURITY OF 5G  The European Commission’s Recommendation on the cybersecurity of 5G networks  (hereafter ‘The Recommendation’) published on 26 March, 2019, states that the cybersecurity  of 5G networks is considered critical, to protect the EU’s economy and society and to ensure the  technological sovereignty of the Union. The recommendations called on Member States to  complete national risk assessments and review national measures, to work together at EU level  on a coordinated risk assessment and to prepare a toolbox of possible mitigating measures.  Based on the individual national risk assessments, the Commission and the Member States,  with the support of ENISA, developed a single EU Coordinated Risk Assessment on  Cybersecurity in 5G Networks3 (hereafter ‘Coordinated risk assessment’). This coordinated  risk assessment identifies the main threats and threat actors, the most sensitive assets, the  main vulnerabilities and the main risks. For ease of reference, we re-iterate the main assets, in  section 2.2 and the main risks, in section 2.3.  2.2 TERMINOLOGY AND DEFINITIONS  Terminology and definitions used in this document follows the terminology and definitions in the  Coordinated risk assessment, paragraphs 1.12 and 1.24. For ease of reference, we list them here.  Table 2: Definitions  Term Definition  5G Networks  5G networks means a set of all relevant network infrastructure elements for mobile and wireless  communications technology used for connectivity and value-added services with advanced  performance characteristics such as very high data rates and capacity, low latency communications,  ultra-high reliability, or supporting a high number of connected devices. These may include legacy  networks elements based on previous generations of mobile and wireless communications technology  such as 4G or 3G. 5G networks should be understood to include all relevant parts of the network  Mobile Network  Operators - MNOs4  Entities providing mobile network services5 to users, operating their own network [or] with the help of  third parties6.  Suppliers of MNOs  Entities providing services or infrastructure to MNOs in order to build and/or operate their networks.  This category includes:  ­ Telecom equipment manufacturers;  ­ Other third-party suppliers, such as cloud infrastructure providers, systems integrators, security  and maintenance contractors, transmission equipment manufacturer.  Manufacturers of  connected devices  and related service  providers  Entities providing objects or services that will connect to the 5G networks (e.g. smartphones,  connected vehicles, e-health) and related service components hosted in 5G control plane as defined  in Service Based Architecture or Mobile Edge Computing  3 https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/eu-wide-coordinated-risk-assessment-5g-networks-security  4 In the context of EECC, MNOs are one type of providers of public electronic communications networks or of publicly  available electronic communications services  5 In this document mobile network services refer to 5G networks and hence the corresponding term MNOs is used to  denote entities providing 5G mobile network services  6 The original definition as given in the Coordinated risk assessment reads “entities providing mobile network services to  users, operating their own network with the help of third parties”. To avoid a possible confusion that MNOs always depend  on third parties, an ‘or’ has been added to slightly amend the said definition.  https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/eu-wide-coordinated-risk-assessment-5g-networks-security  5G SUPPLEMENT  July 2021  8  2.3 5G ASSETS  Where references are made in this document to critical or sensitive network component or  functions, the identification of these components or functions should be based on and  consistent with the high-level categorisation of asset sensitivity defined in the Coordinated  risk assessment, paragraph 2.21.  For ease of reference, we reproduce the table from the referenced paragraph 2.21 below.  Table 3: Assets (according to the Coordinated risk assessment)  Categories of elements  and functions  Criticality Examples of key elements  Core network functions CRITICAL  User Equipment Authentication, roaming and Session  Management Functions; User Equipment data transport  functions; Access policy management; Registration and  authorization of network services; Storage of end-user and  network data; Link with third-party mobile networks; Exposure  of core network functions to external applications; Attribution  of end-user devices to network slices  NFV management and  network orchestration  (MANO)  CRITICAL  Management systems and  supporting services  (other than MANO)  MODERATE/HIGH  Security management systems; Billing and other support  systems such as network performance  Radio Access network HIGH Base stations  Transport and  transmission functions  MODERATE/HIGH  Low-level network equipment (routers, switches, etc.); Filtering  equipment (firewalls, IPS...)  Internetwork exchanges MODERATE/HIGH  IP networks external to MNO premises; Network services  provided by third parties  Further details about the listed asset categories is available in paragraphs 2.22 - 2.27 of the Coordinated risk  assessment.  Remark: The above list of assets is a generic, high-level list, looking at the overall elements of 5G architecture. When  identifying specific assets, MNOs are expected to follow the recommended approach from the Guideline and to  perform their own analysis, specific for their particular setting and to determine which specific assets are in scope (see  section 4.1 of the Guideline). With transition to 5G network and services, such asset lists are expected to be updated  in order consider new assets introduced (as also recommended further in section 3) and should ideally be aligned with  the above list of assets, in particular in terms of estimated asset criticality.  2.4 5G RISKS  Coordinated risk assessment identified several main risk categories illustrated by concrete risk scenarios, describing  possible attacks paths that a threat actor can use to reach its target. For ease of reference, we list these risks in the  table below, reproducing the text from the Coordinated risk assessment.  5G SUPPLEMENT  July 2021  9  Table 4: Risks (according to the Coordinated risk assessment)  Risk group Individual risks/risk scenarios  I - Risk scenarios  related to  insufficient  security measures  R1: Misconfiguration of networks: Exploiting poorly configured systems and architecture, a State  actor penetrates into the 5G network via its external interfaces, leading to the compromise of the  network core functions, or exploits edge-computing nodes in order to compromise information  confidentiality and disrupt distributed services.  R2: Lack of access controls: A subcontractor with administrator’s privileges on the network  performs adverse action, leading to confidentiality/integrity and/or availability breach. The  subcontractor’s action may be due to a legal requirement imposed by a third country or rogue  behaviour of the contractor’s staff.  II – Risk scenarios  related to 5G  supply chain  R3: Low product quality: Espionage by state or state-backed actors using malware to abuse poor  quality network components or unintentional vulnerabilities affecting sensitive elements in the core  network, such as Network Virtualisation Functions.  R4: Dependency on any single supplier within individual networks or lack of diversity on nation- wide basis: A mobile network operator sources a large amount of its sensitive network  components or services from a single supplier. The availability of equipment and/or updates from  this supplier is subsequently drastically reduced, due to a failure by the supplier to supply (e.g.  due to trade sanctions by a third State or to other commercial circumstances). In consequence,  the quality of a supplier’s equipment decreases due to priority given to guaranteeing supply over  improvements in product security.  III - Risk scenarios  related to modus  operandi of main  threat actors  R5: State interference through 5G supply chain: A hostile state actor exercises pressure over a  supplier under its jurisdiction to provide access to sensitive network assets through (either  purposefully or unintentionally) embedded vulnerabilities.  R6: Exploitation of 5G networks by organised crime or Organised crime group targeting end- users: By taking control of a critical part of the 5G network architecture, an organized crime group  disrupts various services to ransom businesses relying on those services, or the mobile network  operator itself. Alternatively, using a similar attack path, an organised crime group may also target  end-users, e.g. by injecting false messages to the users of the network as part of a large-scale  “phishing” attack or online scam, or by using the compromised network to gain access to  confidential data about users (e.g. second-factor authentication codes) for further profit.  IV - Risk scenarios  related to  interdependencies  between 5G  networks and other  critical systems  R7: Significant disruption of critical infrastructures or services: Malicious hackers are able to  compromise emergency services by gaining control of their dedicated network slice, thus  compromising the availability of the service and the integrity of the information/data used for/within  that service.  R8: Massive failure of networks due to interruption of electricity supply or other support systems:  Massive outage of power supply due to natural disasters or to attacks to the energy grid by a  state, a state-backed actor or an organised crime group.  V - Risk scenarios  related to end user  devices  R9: IoT (Internet of Things) exploitation: A hacktivist group or state-backed actor takes control of  low security devices like IoT (sensors, home appliances, etc.), in order to attack the network by  overwhelming its signalling plane.  Remark: The above list of risks identified in the Coordinated risk assessment may be seen as a  generic, high-level list of risks that are believed to be relevant for MS across EU. In reality, MNOs are  expected to follow the recommended approach from the Guideline and to perform their own risk  assessment, specific for their particular setting and to determine which specific risks are relevant (see  section 4.1 of the Guideline). With transition to 5G network and services, such risk assessment is  expected to be updated in order consider specific 5G risks (as also recommended further in section 3)  and should ideally be aligned with the above list of risks.  We refer the reader to the ENISA 5G threat landscape7 for a more detailed and more technical  overview of threats for 5G networks.  7 For information about the ENISA Threat Landscape for 5G networks, refer to section 4 and Table 15.  5G SUPPLEMENT  July 2021  10  2.5 MITIGATING MEASURES IN THE 5G CYBERSECURITY TOOLBOX  On 29 January 2020, the NIS Cooperation Group published the EU toolbox of risk mitigating  measures8 (‘the Toolbox’) addressing the risks identified in the coordinated risk assessment.  On the same date, the Commission adopted a Communication (Secure 5G deployment in  the EU - Implementing the EU Toolbox)9, in which it endorsed the Toolbox conclusions and  underlined the importance of their effective and quick implementation and called on Member  States to take concrete steps to implement them.  The Toolbox identifies two groups of measures MS can take: strategic and technical measures  and it also identifies a number of supporting actions that may enable, assist in implementation  or improve effectiveness of the strategic and technical measures.  Figure 2: Toolbox structure  We summarize the strategic and technical measures in the Toolbox in the tables below.  Table 5: List of strategic measures from the Toolbox  Strategic Measures  SM01 Strengthening the role of national authorities  SM02 Performing audits on operators and requiring information  SM03  Assessing the risk profile of suppliers and applying restrictions  for suppliers  considered to be high risk  SM04  Controlling the use of Managed Service Providers (MSPs) and equipment suppliers’  third line support  SM05  Ensuring the diversity of suppliers for individual MNOs through appropriate multi- vendor strategies  SM06 Strengthening the resilience at national level  SM07  Identifying key assets and fostering a diverse and sustainable 5G ecosystem in the  EU  8 https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/cybersecurity-5g-networks-eu-toolbox-risk-mitigating-measures  9 Commission Communication COM (2020)50, Secure 5G deployment in the EU - Implementing the EU toolbox, 29 January  2020, https://ec.europa.eu/newsroom/dae/document.cfm?doc_id=64481  https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/cybersecurity-5g-networks-eu-toolbox-risk-mitigating-measures https://ec.europa.eu/newsroom/dae/document.cfm?doc_id=64481  5G SUPPLEMENT  July 2021  11  Table 6: List of technical measures from the Toolbox  Technical Measures  TM01  Ensuring the application of baseline security requirements (secure net. design and  architecture)  TM02  Ensuring and evaluating the implementation of security measures in existing 5G  standards  TM03 Ensuring strict access controls  TM04 Increasing the security of virtualised network functions  TM05 Ensuring secure 5G network management, operation and monitoring  TM06 Reinforcing physical security  TM07 Reinforcing software integrity, update and patch management  TM08  Raising the security standards in suppliers’ processes through robust procurement  conditions  TM09  Using EU certification for 5G net. components, customer equipment and/or suppliers’  processes  TM10 Using EU certification for other non 5G-specific ICT products and services10  TM11 Reinforcing resilience and continuity plans  Table 7: List of supporting actions from the Toolbox  Supporting Actions  SA01 Reviewing or developing guidelines and best practices on network security  SA02 Reinforcing testing and auditing capabilities at national and EU level  SA03 Supporting and shaping 5G standardisation  SA04  Developing guidance on the implementation of security measures in existing 5G  standards  SA05  Ensuring the application of standard technical and organisational security measures  through specific EU-wide certification scheme  SA06  Exchanging best practices on the implementation of strategic measures, in particular  national frameworks for assessing the risk profile of suppliers  SA07 Improving coordination in incident response and crisis management  SA08  Conducting audits of interdependencies between 5G networks and other critical  services  SA09 Enhancing cooperation, coordination and information sharing mechanisms  SA10  Ensuring 5G deployment projects supported with public funding take into account  cybersecurity risks  10 Connected devices, cloud services  5G SUPPLEMENT  July 2021  12  2.6 GUIDELINE ON SECURITY MEASURES UNDER THE EECC  The ENISA Guideline on Security Measures under the EECC11, referred to as the Guideline,  provides guidance to competent authorities about the technical details of implementing Articles  40 and 41 of the EECC. It gives guidance to authorities on how to ensure that providers assess  risks and take appropriate security measures. It contains a list of 29 high-level security  objectives, grouped in 8 domains. Per security objective it lists detailed security measures which  could be taken by providers to reach the security objective. The measures are grouped in 3  levels of increasing sophistication. The overall structure of security objectives and security  measures is depicted in the diagram below.  Figure 3: Overall structure of the security objectives and security measures  The Guideline is split in 8 security domains:   D1: Governance and risk management   D2: Human resources security   D3: Security of systems and facilities   D4: Operations management   D5: Incident management   D6: Business continuity management   D7: Monitoring, auditing and testing   D8: Threat awareness  The Guideline is technology neutral and the security measures are applicable to different types of networks and  services and different types of electronic communication providers.  11 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/guideline-on-security-measures-under-the-eecc  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/guideline-on-security-measures-under-the-eecc  5G SUPPLEMENT  July 2021  13  5G TECHNOLOGY PROFILE  This section, the 5G technology profile, supplements the Guideline, which is generic and  technology-agnostic, with additional and more specific guidance on 5G by clarifying and refining  the security measures for 5G networks and services.  When supervising MNOs offering 5G networks, competent authorities should ask a number of  high-level, general questions:  1. Does the MNO already have the general security measures in place, such as the  security measures contained in the Guideline on Security Measures under the EECC?  2. Has the MNO updated the risk assessments, asset lists and operational procedures  and has it reinforced general security measures accordingly, as required for the 5G  network deployment and operation?  3. Is the MNO implementing specific security measures from the relevant 5G standards  such as 3GPP12, including the security-relevant optional controls, and does the same  principle also apply to products and equipment that MNO is using in the network?  4. Has the MNO considered the key new technologies of specific relevance for 5G  networks (such as virtualization, slicing, edge computing etc.) in the overall risk  assessment and has it deployed adequate controls for mitigating related risks?  In the rest of this section we provide detailed guidance for competent authorities for each of the  8 security domains, as follows:   For each of the domains we first list all the underlying security objectives;   We then highlight those objectives that may be considered of particular importance for  5G networks and services and we provide a brief rationale for their relevance;   For each of these highlighted objectives we also include a checklist containing  additional elements that competent authorities may consider;   Finally, we include reference to related technical measures from the Toolbox13.  Remark: Taking into account the type of service provided and perceived overall level of risk,  competent authorities may want to consider requesting the implementation of measure up to  level 3, in particular for those security objectives identified (in the step #2 above) to be of  particular importance. However, it is ultimately up to the competent authorities to choose the  appropriate sophistication levels, taking in consideration also the guidance provided in section  4.2 of the Guideline (Remark on minimum security measures).  12 When assessing the implementation of security controls from the 3GPP standards, competent authorities may find useful  to refer to the reference list provided in Annex II of this supplement.  13 In addition, Annex III of this supplement includes a mapping table between the (supplemented) Guideline security  domains and related technical measures from the Toolbox that are being addressed through the implementation of related  measures and supplementary guidance, in addition to the baseline measure TM01 which pertains to all security domains  5G SUPPLEMENT  July 2021  14  3.1 DOMAIN D1: GOVERNANCE AND RISK MANAGEMENT  Domain D1 (Governance and risk management) covers the following security objectives:   SO 1: Information security policy   SO 2: Governance and risk management   SO 3: Security roles and responsibilities   SO 4: Security of third-party dependencies  This security domain is important to ensure that MNOs have appropriate measures and  processes in place to manage information security risks continuously and adequately. It is of  particular importance to ensure that the list of risks is reviewed and updated to consider key  risks specific to 5G networks, especially those identified in the Coordinated risk assessment and  that adequate technical measures are in place for mitigating supply-chain risks pertaining to 5G  networks. Depending on the national approach in respect of assessment of high-risk supplier  (as per the Toolbox measure SM03), this may also include requirements for MNOs to conduct  an assessment of the risk profile of their key suppliers, say in relation to the last criteria  mentioned in the Coordinated risk assessment: The overall quality of products and  cybersecurity practices of the supplier, including the degree of control over its own supply chain  and whether adequate prioritisation is given to security practices. Some of the guidance listed  further in this section includes examples of checks that could be considered in this regard14.  Competent authorities should pay close attention to objectives SO 2 (Governance and risk  management) and SO 4 (Security of third-party dependencies), checking that measures  under these objectives are implemented and considering additional checks as suggested in the  tables below. This addresses Toolbox measures TM08 and, to some extent, TM09 and TM10.  Table 8: Additional guidance checklist for domain D1  # SO Checks to consider Ref.15  1 SO2  Is the list of identified risks aligned with the main risks for 5G networks identified in the Coordinated  risk assessment?

[a,e] [i,vi]  3 SO2  Has a potential dependency on a single supplier of 5G equipment been considered when assessing  the main risks for security of networks and services?  [a,e] [i,vi]  4 SO4  Does MNO have security requirements placed on third parties as part of contractual arrangements &  is there a mechanism to monitor that suppliers are meeting said contractual arrangements?  [e] [vi]  5 SO4  Does MNO require suppliers to comply with relevant EU certification schemes for 5G network  components, customer equipment and/or suppliers’ processes or for other non 5G-specific ICT  products and services, such as end-user devices and/or cloud services16?  [e] [vi]  6 SO4  Does MNO require suppliers to demonstrate quality level of internal information security processes,  including having security by design, built in the product development process?  [e] [vi]  7 SO4  Does MNO require suppliers to adhere to best practices and industry standards throughout the  lifetime of the product?  [e] [vi]  14  In addition, competent authorities may also want to explore and make use, if appropriate, of a concept of supplier  trustworthiness, as applied in some MS. For example, according to Annex 2 of Germany's security catalogue  (https://ec.europa.eu/growth/tools- databases/tris/de/index.cfm/search/?trisaction=search.detail&year=2020&num=496&mLang=EN), public  telecommunications network operators and providers of publicly accessible telecommunications services with increased  criticality are required to, in particular, appropriately select manufacturers and sellers or suppliers of critical components  before purchasing them. An appropriate selection also includes an appropriate examination of the supply source’s  trustworthiness. The obligated company must obtain a comprehensive declaration from the supply source to demonstrate  its trustworthiness. The declaration must relate to all safety-relevant components and, if applicable, functionalities, as well  as the supply source itself (the manufacturer, including the supplier, and, if applicable, the seller or supplier).  15 Here, and further in this section, the reference in the last column of a checklist table refers to the corresponding  measure(s) and related evidence(s) in the Guideline that are most relevant for the check suggested and is provided in the  following format: [measure id] [evidence id]  16 When an EU certification schemes are not available, other interim solutions, such as reliance on certification schemes  based on industry standards, could be considered instead.  https://ec.europa.eu/growth/tools-databases/tris/de/index.cfm/search/?trisaction=search.detail&year=2020&num=496&mLang=EN https://ec.europa.eu/growth/tools-databases/tris/de/index.cfm/search/?trisaction=search.detail&year=2020&num=496&mLang=EN  5G SUPPLEMENT  July 2021  15  # SO Checks to consider Ref.15  8 SO4  Does MNO require suppliers to provide support for periodic security and penetration testing of its  products?

[e] [vi]  When reviewing and refining requirements for MNOs related to procurement (in relation to the  above highlighted security objective SO 4 - Security of third-party dependencies), competent  authorities may also find useful to explore to technical reports and best practices related to  security requirements for ICT procurement, such as the two ENISA reports listed below.

This could be of particular  importance in the context of 5G networks, with increased reliance on sub-contractors, including  those from third countries, for the purpose of managing critical network functions. Moreover,  adequate knowledge of key personnel is relevant for addressing one of the important  vulnerabilities identified in the coordinated EU risk assessment, which applies particularly to  17 In the case of vulnerabilities disclosed by the suppliers, competent authorities may also want to ensure that MNOs  disclose such vulnerabilities to them  18 Including all 3GPP optional security features of direct relevance for 5G network security  19 Security should ideally be a shared responsibility between MNOs and suppliers.  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/indispensable-baseline-security-requirements-for-the-procurement-of-secure-ict-products-and-services https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/indispensable-baseline-security-requirements-for-the-procurement-of-secure-ict-products-and-services https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/indispensable-baseline-security-requirements-for-the-procurement-of-secure-ict-products-and-services https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/indispensable-baseline-security-requirements-for-the-procurement-of-secure-ict-products-and-services https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/indispensable-baseline-security-requirements-for-the-procurement-of-secure-ict-products-and-services https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/security-guide-for-ict-procurement https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/security-guide-for-ict-procurement https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/security-guide-for-ict-procurement  5G SUPPLEMENT  July 2021  16  MNOs: lack of specialised and trained personnel to secure, monitor and maintain 5G networks  and services.  Competent authorities should pay close attention to objectives SO 5 (Background checks) and  SO 6 (Security knowledge and training), checking that measures under these objectives are  implemented and considering additional checks as suggested in the tables below. This  addresses Toolbox measures TM05 and TM06.  Table 9: Additional guidance checklist for domain D2  # SO Checks to consider Ref.  1 SO5  Does the list of personnel for whom background checks/screening has been performed also include  contractors and third-party suppliers?  [b] [ii]  2 SO5  Are personnel who will have access (either physically or through management systems) to critical or  sensitive components of 5G networks security-vetted (as stipulated in the provisions of the Toolbox  technical measure TM06)?  [b] [ii]  3 SO6 Has the training program been updated to include coverage of specialized 5G technical topics? [d] [iv]  4 SO6  Is there an evidence that the key personnel who will be in charge of deploying and operating 5G  networks have followed the updated training courses?  [d] [v]  5 SO6  Is there an evidence that personnel who will have access (either physically or through management  systems) to critical or sensitive network components are trained and qualified (as stipulated in the  provisions of the Toolbox technical measure TM06)?  [d] [v]  3.3 DOMAIN D3: SECURITY OF SYSTEMS AND FACILITIES  Domain D3 (Security of systems and facilities) covers the following security objectives:   SO 9: Physical and environmental security   SO 10: Security of supplies   SO 11: Access control to network and information systems   SO 12: Integrity of network and information systems   SO 13: Use of encryption   SO 14: Protection of security-critical data  These security objectives contain various controls for ensuring physical and logical security of  networks and systems. For this reason the domain D3 plays perhaps a central role in ensuring  technical protection of critical or sensitive network components or functions, since majority of  technical risks identified in the Coordinated risk assessment and, subsequently, majority of  related technical measures identified in the Toolbox, are related precisely to physical and logical  security of 5G networks and related information systems and facilities.  Competent authorities should therefore pay close attention to objectives SO 9 (Physical and  environmental security), SO 11 (Access control to network and information systems), SO  12 (Integrity of network and information systems), SO 13 (Use of encryption) and SO 14  (Protection of security-critical data under this domain), checking that measures under these  objectives are implemented and considering some of the additional checks as suggested in the  tables below. This addresses Toolbox measures TM03, TM06 and TM07 and is related to the  Toolbox measures TM02 and TM04.  5G SUPPLEMENT  July 2021  17  Table 10: Additional guidance checklist for domain D3  # SO Checks to consider Ref.  1 SO9  Are there documented, additional, risk-based controls for physical security for MEC and base  stations included in the policy for physical security measures?

If interpreted in its wider meaning, as pertaining to general integrity of network and  information systems, then securing hardware devices that contain data or that ultimately will be running embedded software  themselves, could be considered in the scope. Alternative mappings of this check could be considered, such as related it to  SO 10 – Security of supplies (although supplies in this context pertain more to utilities such as power supply), to SO 4 –  Security of third-party dependencies (if the obligation is defined for suppliers) or even SO 9 – Physical security (if assets not  yet deployed within the network are included in the scope).  22  E.g.

[a,b] [i]  3.4 DOMAIN D4: OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT  Domain D4 (Operations management) covers the following security objectives:   SO 15: Operational procedures   SO 16: Change management   SO 17: Asset management  Considering the technical complexity and increased softwarization of key elements of 5G  network infrastructure, it is of particular importance that MNOs have good and up-to-date  operational procedures in place, in particular related to asset management, to understand the  critical assets, and to have solid change management mechanisms in place.  Competent authorities should therefore pay close attention to objectives SO 16 (Change  management) and SO 17 (Asset management), checking that measures under these  objectives are implemented and considering additional checks as suggested in the tables below.  This address Toolbox measure TM07.  Table 11: Additional guidance checklist for domain D4  # SO Checks to consider Ref.  1 SO16  Are there regular assessments of potential impact of an intended change prior to major system  changes, especially when critical or sensitive network components are about to be updated?  [all] [ii,iv]  2 SO16  Is there a mechanism in place to ensure that any major actual change implemented, especially for  critical or sensitive network components, is recorded and any irregularities encountered during the  change process are investigated and, if incident reporting conditions are met, reported to competent  authorities?  [all] [ii,iv]  3 SO16  Are changes to virtualised network environment (e.g. through patching of software defined network  components) included in the change management policies and procedures?  [b,d] [ii,iv]  4 SO16  Has MNO given consideration to moving to software development lifecycle best practices such as  Agile, Continuous Integration/Continuous Development (CI/CD), and DevSecOps, given 5G’s shift to  a software based network?  [b,d] [ii,iv]  5 SO17  Is asset criticality assessment aligned with the list of critical assets identified in the Coordinated risk  assessment?  [b,c] [ii,v]  6 SO17  Has the MNO established relevant information repositories/registries containing details about  deployed technologies and components and are such registries appropriately maintained (e.g. timely  updates upon changes to the network)?  [b,c] [ii,v]  7 SO17  Are there mechanisms envisaged in the MNO policies/procedures for asset management for  conducting regular assessments of their physical assets and for categorisation of their physical  network assets (e.g. core network assets, transmission hubs, exchanges, base-stations,  [b,c] [ii,v]  26 Even when transferred from the UICC manufacturer to the MNO  27 This may include (but Is not limited to) cryptographic key material for remote SIM provisioning, for operating the N32  interface and DIAMETER or for the operation of the SIP infrastructure  5G SUPPLEMENT  July 2021  19  # SO Checks to consider Ref.  interconnection and transport links) based on a risk assessment and according to the assets  sensitivity/criticality.  8 SO17  Have policies/procedures for asset management been updated to reflect the fact that 5G networks  will likely be virtualised, with VNFs being instantiated and decommissioned in an automated way and  do such updates include sufficient provisions to ensure good understanding of the virtual network,  including data flows, trust domains and the location and status of the physical hosts on which the  virtual network resides?  [b,c] [ii,v]  3.5 DOMAIN D5: INCIDENT MANAGEMENT  Domain D5 (Incident management) covers the following security objectives:   SO 18: Incident management procedures   SO 19: Incident detection capability   SO 20: Incident reporting and communication  Technological complexity of new generation mobile networks, potential dependency on  suppliers and/or managed service providers that provide equipment and/or services, sometimes  using remote connections from third countries and the overall complexity of the threat landscape  require mature incident management capabilities, including state of the art incident detection  capabilities. Moreover, comprehensive and reliable reporting on incidents that had a significant  impact on operations of 5G networks and services to relevant competent authorities is equally  important.  Competent authorities should therefore pay close attention to objectives SO 19 (Incident  detection capability) and SO 20 (Incident reporting and communication), checking that  measures under these objectives are implemented and considering additional checks as  suggested in the tables below. This addresses Toolbox measure TM05.  Table 12: Additional guidance checklist for domain D5  # SO Checks to consider Ref.  1 SO19  Are relevant logs related to remote network access regularly reviewed according to predefined  procedures?  [d] [v]  2 SO19 Are there capabilities for anomaly detection in place? [b] [ii]  3 SO19  Is the monitoring infrastructure28 implemented according to the recommendation from the Toolbox,  including whether such monitoring infrastructure is established on premise, ideally inside the country  or inside the EU29?  [c] [iii]  4 SO19  Does MNO have adequate resources available to monitor, understand and analyse security-related  network activity?  [b] [ii]  5 SO20 Does MNO comply with relevant incident reporting provisions within a given legal framework? [c] [iv]  3.6 DOMAIN D6: BUSINESS CONTINUITY MANAGEMENT  Domain D6 (Business continuity management) covers the following security objectives:   SO 21: Service continuity strategy and contingency plans   SO 22: Disaster recovery capabilities  28 such as Network Operation Centres (NOC) and/or Security Operation Centres (SOC), that can serve for the purpose of  timely detection of significant events or incidents  29 This follows the general requirement as identified in the Toolbox technical measure TM05, implementation on MS level  may vary  5G SUPPLEMENT  July 2021  20  Implementation of measures under this domain ensures robust network resilience and adequate  disaster recovery and business continuity capabilities. And while this may already be essential  part of MNO’s operations, it is worth emphasizing its importance in the context of 5G networks,  as indicated in both the Coordinated risk assessment and the Toolbox. In the Coordinated risk  assessment, a massive failure of networks due to interruption of electricity supply or other  support systems is explicitly highlighted as one of the 9 identified significant risks to 5G  networks. Consequently, the Toolbox technical measure TM11 calls MNOs to further strengthen  the corresponding resilience and continuity plans.  Competent authorities should pay close attention to objectives SO 21 (Service continuity  strategy and contingency plans) and SO 22 (Disaster recovery capabilities), checking that  measures under these objectives are implemented and considering additional checks as  suggested in the tables below. This addresses Toolbox technical measure TM11.  Table 13: Additional guidance checklist for domain D6  # SO Checks to consider Ref.  1 SO21  Are there measures in place to ensure supply-chain resilience (e.g. by ensuring that contingency  plans consider scenarios of removal of critical suppliers30, understanding the related impact and  having appropriate failback strategies in place)?  [b] [ii]  2 SO21  Are there any special provisions added to existing contingency plans to cover time-critical  applications of 5G services, such as URLLC as to ensure higher network availability for such  services?  [b] [ii]  3 SO21  Is there a map of critical dependencies that may directly or indirectly impact availability or continuity  of 5G network service and if corresponding mitigation measures are defined and documented?  [d] [v]  4 SO21  Is there a map of critical sectors and services directly dependent on the continuity of network and  service operations and if criticality of such systems is taken in consideration in contingency plans?  [d] [v]  5 SO22  Are there documented plans in place in case of a disaster affecting the ongoing operation of the  MNO’s network?  [b] [ii]  3.7 DOMAIN D7: MONITORING, AUDITING AND TESTING  Domain D7, Monitoring, auditing and testing, covers the following security objectives:   SO 23: Monitoring and logging policies   SO 24: Exercise contingency plans   SO 25: Network and information system testing   SO 26: Security assessments   SO 27: Compliance monitoring  In addition to having robust incident detection and management capabilities in place, as  discussed earlier, having sophisticated monitoring and logging capabilities is of significant  importance for detecting and analysing security incidents. This may particularly be relevant for  the environments where remote access to critical or sensitive network components or functions  is expected and especially when such access is to be established from third countries and/or  from suppliers or service providers considered to be high-risk. Coordinated risk assessment, in  particular, identifies lack of adequate monitoring practices in MNOs as one of the key  vulnerabilities. Consequently, the need for strict monitoring and logging is emphasized in  Toolbox technical measure TM05 as well as in the technical measure TM03.  At the same time, considering the increased virtualization and softwarization, the importance of  testing and security assessments may be higher in 5G networks. Although not explicitly  30 Say, due to trade sanctions, market conditions or similar  5G SUPPLEMENT  July 2021  21  mentioned in the Toolbox, this is implicitly related to some of the technical measures, in  particular to the technical measure TM0731.  Finally, having the appropriate compliance monitoring in place ensures continuous compliance  with relevant standards and in the context of 5G this could also ensure compliance with relevant  5G standards, such as 3GPP, as requested by the Toolbox (technical measure TM02).  Competent authorities should therefore pay close attention to objectives SO 23 (Monitoring  and logging policies), SO25 (Network and information system testing), SO 26 (Security  assessments) and SO 27 (Compliance monitoring), checking that measures under these  objectives are implemented and considering additional checks as suggested in the tables below.  This addresses Toolbox measures TM03, TM05 and TM07 and is related to the Toolbox  measures TM02 and TM04.  Table 14: Additional guidance checklist for domain D7  # SO Checks to consider Ref.  1 SO23  Are there adequate monitoring capabilities in place in line with the recommendations form the  Toolbox technical measure TM05, to ensure providing clear visibility and to implement effective  network monitoring of at least the critical or sensitive network components or functions, to detect  anomalies and to identify and avoid threats, including but not limited to threats to 5G core coming  from compromised end-user devices?  [b,c] [iii,iv]  2 SO23  Does the monitoring and logging policy also include monitoring of VPN and remote access to 5G  network from remote locations32?  [b,c] [ii]  3 SO23  Is there monitoring in place for roaming and interconnections (e.g. message monitoring and filtering  capabilities to identify and block malformed, prohibited and unauthorised packets, confirm that  interfaces are only accessible to the correct external applications and/or networks and enabling of  audit logging and delivery of data to SIEM for analysis for relevant threat vectors)?  [b,c] [iii,iv]  4 SO25  Are all patches, especially those to critical or sensitive network components or functions, subjected  to security testing in controlled environment prior to deployment?  [a,d] [i,iii]  5 SO26  Are security tests, vulnerability assessments/scans and penetration tests done on deployment and  subsequently, on periodic basis, for newly deployed network components, in particular for products  supplied by suppliers considered to be high-risk?  [a,d] [i,iii]  6 SO27  Is monitoring of compliance with relevant 5G standards (e.g. 3GPP, ETSI NFV33) included in the  compliance monitoring policies and procedures?  [c,d] [iv,v]  3.8 DOMAIN D8: THREAT AWARENESS  Domain D8, Threat awareness, covers the following security objectives:   SO 28: Threat intelligence   SO 29: Informing users about the threats  In the complex and evolving 5G threat landscape, it is necessary to ensure that MNOs operating  5G networks are aware of the current and emerging threats and that they take them in  consideration when (re)assessing security risks. At the same time, user awareness about  known threats and vulnerabilities, as recommended in the security objective SO29, may  increase the overall security of 5G services provided to end-users.  Competent authorities may want to focus in particular on objectives SO 28 (Threat  intelligence) and SO 29 (Informing users about the threats), checking that measures under  31 The Toolbox implementation report, published in June 2019, implicitly confirms the importance of good security testing  practices by referring to best practices in several MS who have highlighted the relevance of this security control. One of the  sources to consider for general guidance on security testing best practices is the US NIST special publication SP-800-115,  Technical Guide to Information Security Testing and Assessment  https://tsapps.nist.gov/publication/get_pdf.cfm?pub_id=152164  32 This may include installation of appropriate technical solutions for monitoring such as recording jump-boxes for remote  connections  33 References to related technical specs for 3GPP and ETSI NFV standards can be found in Annex II and Section 4 of this  supplement, respectively  https://tsapps.nist.gov/publication/get_pdf.cfm?pub_id=152164  5G SUPPLEMENT  July 2021  22  these objectives are implemented and considering additional checks as suggested in the table  below. This addresses Toolbox measure TM05 and is related to the Toolbox supporting action  SA09 and may contribute to the mitigation of the Risk 9 from the Coordinated risk assessment  (listed in the Table 3 in this document).

[b] [iv]  4 SO29  Has guidance been provided to consumers and enterprises on signalling threats in legacy network  environments (associated with SS736, GTP37 and Diameter38 signalling protocols) such as location  tracking, interception of data, call, e-mail and SMS messages, financial fraud and theft or digital  identity theft and highlighting the risk of using SMS as a multi-factor authentication mechanism?

Examples include MISP (https://www.misp-project.org/), OpenCTI (https://www.opencti.io/en/) and others.  36 Signalling System 7 (SS7) is a set of signalling protocols developed in 1975, used primarily in 2G, 3G and fixed networks,  to exchange information among different elements of the same network or between networks (call routing, roaming  information, features available to subscriber etc.).  37 GPRS Tunnelling Protocol (GTP) is a group of IP-based communications protocols used to carry general packet radio  service (GPRS) within GSM, UMTS and LTE networks  38 Diameter Protocol provides authentication, authorization, and accounting (AAA) messaging services for network access  and data mobility applications primarily in 3G, IP Multimedia Systems (IMS), and LTE/4G networks and may also be used in  5G networks  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/enisa-threat-landscape-for-5g-networks https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/enisa-threat-landscape-for-5g-networks https://www.misp-project.org/ https://www.opencti.io/en/  5G SUPPLEMENT  July 2021  23  SECURITY OF SPECIFIC 5G  TECHNOLOGIES  5G introduces or utilises several new technologies, in different places of the network, such as:   Network virtualization   Network slicing   Edge computing  Number of security risks related to the utilisation of the above listed technologies in MNO’s 5G  networks can be addressed by deploying general network security and information security  management controls, such as those related to access control (including robust authentication  and authorization mechanisms), DDoS prevention, reinforced physical security (including at  remote locations) or security incident and event monitoring. Therefore, it is important that  competent authorities ensure implementation and audit of relevant measures from the  corresponding Guideline security objectives, taking in consideration additional guidance  provided in this supplement, where applicable.  However, there are some specific vulnerabilities related to these technologies, which MNOs  would have to take in consideration when doing a risk assessment. Consequently, the identified  risks need to be addressed adequately, which in some cases may require implementation of  additional security controls.  In this section, we provide further high-level information about some of these underlying  technologies and we highlight the most relevant security aspects. We also include reference  lists with pointers to the relevant industry standards and best practices for each of these  technologies.  A more detailed technical information about the listed technologies and their security aspects,  including the architecture, assets, security considerations and threats can be found it the  comprehensive ENISA threat landscape for 5G Networks39 (hereinafter ‘ETL5G’). The new  version of the report (currently in preparation) also brings analysis of vulnerabilities and  identification of related security controls.  Table 16: ENISA Threat Landscape for 5G Networks  Document Body Description URL  ENISA Threat  Landscape for  5G networks  2019  ENISA  The 2019 report drew an initial threat landscape  and presented an overview of the challenges in the  security of 5G networks.

The main benefits of the NFV technology  are scalability and better utilisation of network resources; reduced power consumption and  improved efficiency of space usage; and reduced operational and capital expenditures.  The main elements of the NFV architecture are:   Virtual Network Functions (VNFs);   NFV Infrastructure (NFVI); and   Management, Automation and Network Orchestration (MANO) layer.  The latter, MANO, is also identified as a critical asset in the EU coordinated risk assessment.  A more detailed technical information about the NFV architecture can be found in ETL5G. The  same report also identifies the key virtualisation threats, being the following:   Abuse on Data Centres Interconnect (DCI) protocol   Abuse of cloud computational resources   Network virtualisation bypassing   Virtualised host abuse  The closely related technology is Software Defined Networks (SDN). It allows dynamic  management of network resources by separating the network control plane from the data plane.  This enables a directly programmable network control and an abstracted underlying  infrastructure for applications and network services. A logically centralised control plane allows  a network wide view of data plane network elements. This can then be exposed to the  application layer to achieve simplified network management and improved agility. ETL5G  identifies and explains number of control plane, data plane and API related vulnerabilities in  SDN.  Another related concept of relevance is containerisation. Containerisation is essentially a  simplified form of virtualisation, whereby instead of running an entire operating system virtually  only the user-space elements of the host OS are separated from each other and the hosting  operating system. This gives all the advantages of full virtualisation but without the overhead of  running the full guest OS, thus leading to greater efficiencies, although it does require that each  container presents the same OS version to all applications (i.e. identical instances of the host  OS). The efficiency and reliability gains greatly increase the portability of such containers and  the ability to move entire application stacks within a virtualised environment has been made of  great use for application development. The table 16 (below) includes references to documents  that cover security aspects of containerisation in more detail.  In addition to ensuring the implementation of general security measures from the Guideline and  taking in consideration additional guidance provided in the chapter 3 of this supplement,  competent authorities may also want to check that relevant network virtualisation security risks  are included in MNO’s security assessment and that MNOs follow industry standards and best  practices, in particular relevant ETSI NFV. We list the most relevant41 ETSI technical  specifications and additional relevant technical reports and documents, including two ENISA  publications on SDN and virtualization security in the following table.  40 https://searchnetworking.techtarget.com/definition/network-functions-virtualization-NFV  41 The list of ETSI NFV-SEC specifications given in the table does not include all the specification document, but only  selected ones, that are believed to be of most relevance in terms of identifying specific detailed technical controls that could  be considered for securing NFV.

The objective is to provide a set of optimised resources and  network topology to satisfy the needs of use cases (for example, connectivity, speed, latency  and capacity) and conform to a specific service level agreement. As NFV, MEC and SDN, the  network slicing concept is also built on virtual networking architecture where multiple virtual  networks are established using shared physical infrastructure. Using common network  resources (e.g. storage and processors), network slices can be created to establish a logical  and self-contained network configured and connected end-to-end.  A detailed technical information about the network slicing architecture can be found in ETL5G.  The same report also identifies the key areas network slicing vulnerabilities42 (Security-as-a-  Service, Resource isolation, Secure Management and Orchestration and Trust Model) and  provides further explanations related to these vulnerabilities.  In addition to ensuring the implementation of general security measures from the Guideline and  taking in consideration additional guidance provided in the section 3 of this supplement,  competent authorities also may want to check that relevant network slicing security risks are  included in MNO’s security assessment and that MNOs follow industry standards and best  practices for securing network slicing. We list some of the relevant technical documents in the  table below.  Table 18: Slicing security reference list  Document Body Description URL  Technical reports and other documents  TR 33.811 3GPP  Technical Report (TR) 33.811 (Release 15, June  2018) presents a study on the threats, potential  security requirements and solutions for the 5G  network slicing management and includes  identification of key security issues and  recommended mitigation measures.  https://portal.3gpp.org/desktopmodul es/  Specifications/SpecificationDetails.a spx?specificationId=3358  TR 33.813 3GPP  Technical Report (TR) 33.813 (Release 16, July  2020) is currently being developed mainly to  address network slicing security issues not  addressed in Release 15.

Multi-access Edge Computing (MEC) is a technology aiming to satisfy the  requirements of high-bandwidth and low-latency applications which operate at the edge of the  network43. MEC is based on the convergence of IT and telecommunications networking. Key  benefits are reduced network congestion and improved performance for low latency  applications. The ability of storing, processing and delivering content locally without requiring  backhauling and centralised core network is the main feature of the technology.  Deployment of MEC technology as part of an NFV environment is envisaged. Therefore,  security requirements of MEC enabled applications are expected to be addressed within the  42 Vulnerability analysis is include in the ETL5G only in the 2020 report version (currently in preparation)  43 Based on: https://www.sdxcentral.com/edge/definitions/what-multi-access-edge-computing-mec/  https://portal.3gpp.org/desktopmodules/Specifications/SpecificationDetails.aspx?specificationId=3358 https://portal.3gpp.org/desktopmodules/Specifications/SpecificationDetails.aspx?specificationId=3358 https://portal.3gpp.org/desktopmodules/Specifications/SpecificationDetails.aspx?specificationId=3358 https://portal.3gpp.org/desktopmodules/Specifications/SpecificationDetails.aspx?specificationId=3358 https://portal.3gpp.org/desktopmodules/Specifications/SpecificationDetails.aspx?specificationId=3541 https://portal.3gpp.org/desktopmodules/Specifications/SpecificationDetails.aspx?specificationId=3541 https://portal.3gpp.org/desktopmodules/Specifications/SpecificationDetails.aspx?specificationId=3541 https://www.sdxcentral.com/edge/definitions/what-multi-access-edge-computing-mec/  5G SUPPLEMENT  July 2021  27  NFV security framework. Security fundamentals including data encryption, network visibility,  automated monitoring and access control based on the principle of least privilege and supported  by intrusion prevention and detection are all applicable to the MEC platform. Threats include  infrastructure attacks related to wireless technology vulnerabilities (e.g. denial of service attacks  to consume the bandwidth and computing resources at the edge or man in the middle attacks to  inject or eavesdrop traffic from the edge), virtualisation attacks (e.g. denial of service and man in  the middle attacks by rogue virtual machines) and privacy leakage (e.g. unauthorised access to  information storage in the edge cloud).  A more detailed technical information about the MEC architecture can be found it ETL5G. The  same report also identifies and described the key MEC threats (e.g. a false or rogue MEC  gateway, edge node overload and abuse of edge open APIs) as well as the key areas of  vulnerabilities44 (vulnerabilities related to virtualization and containerization, physical security,  APIs and regulatory issues) and provides further explanations related to these vulnerabilities.  In addition to ensuring the implementation of general security measures from the Guideline and  taking in consideration additional guidance provided in the chapter 3 of this supplement,  competent authorities may want to check that relevant edge computing security risks are  included in MNO’s security assessment and that MNOs follow industry standards and best  practices, in particular relevant technical specifications and reports from ETSI, as a leading  organization in standardization of MEC technology45.

Similarly, software tampering of the  MEC platform should be prevented. To achieve this, platform security, platform  management security, data storage and transmission security need to be enhanced as well  as introducing trusted computing technologies.   An increased number of entry points in the MEC environment (e.g. IoT use case) implies  challenging attack surface and complex certificate management as the absence or  weakness of security measures in MEC devices can be exploited and create vulnerabilities  for the whole network. Ensuring real-time network visibility is one of the key considerations.   Robust authentication and authorisation procedures need to be in place for the MEC  platform which is located much closer to access network than the core network. The key  issue is how to establish a uniform level of security policies for all MEC elements to  minimise the risks.   In terms of network resilience, the introduction of the MEC platform should not affect  network availability. This means that MEC solution vendors should offer the level of  resilience to meet high-availability requirements of network operators. An appropriate  failsafe mechanism should be in place to prevent the MEC platform failure from adversely  affecting the normal operation of the network.  46 Based on: https://www.etsi.org/images/files/ETSIWhitePapers/etsi_wp20ed2_MEC_SoftwareDevelopment.pdf,  https://www.sdxcentral.com/edge/definitions/mec-security/ , https://www.gsma.com/futurenetworks/wp- content/uploads/2020/02/6_Smart-Port-MEC-Security-Application-Based-on-5G-SA_GSMA.pdf,  https://innovationatwork.ieee.org/edge-computing-security-issues-and-trends-to-watch-in-2020/ .

The 5G technology profile gives  additional guidance to competent national authorities about how to ensure the security of 5G  networks. This document was developed in close collaboration with experts from national  telecom security authorities across the EU, i.e. the ECASEC Expert Group (formerly known as  the Article 13a Expert Group), and with the members of the NIS CG work stream for 5G  cybersecurity.  Figure 1: Structure of the ENISA Guideline on Security Measures under the EECC  Considering the dynamic nature of 5G technology and the related threat landscape, this  document is meant to be updated as technology and risks evolve. ENISA may consider using  an alternative electronic format for this supplementary guideline, to better support regular  updates.  1.1 OBJECTIVES AND SCOPE  The objective of this document is to provide additional guidance for competent authorities on  how to ensure that appropriate security measures are taken by providers of 5G networks and  services. This supplement clarifies and refines the more generic security measures in the  Guideline on Security Measures under the EECC specifically for 5G technology.  Considering the complexity of 5G technology and the variety of deployment and configuration  options, both the risks and the necessary security measures will be very different for different  deployments of 5G networks and services. This means that it is important to assess the setup  and the security in depth, for each case, for example by performing audits2 on MNOs.  1 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/guideline-on-security-measures-under-the-eecc  2 This scope of this supplement does not include full audit guidelines for 5G networks, but competent authorities may refer  to the general guidance for auditing communication service providers given in the section 5.6 of the Guideline.  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/guideline-on-security-measures-under-the-eecc  5G SUPPLEMENT  July 2021  6  1.2 POLICY CONTEXT  The Guideline, and this supplement, is a guideline for national authorities with competence on  Article 40 of the EECC.  The Guideline, and this supplement, also addresses Supporting action SA01 of the Union  toolbox of mitigating measures for 5G. It also gives guidance to EU Member States about the  technical security measures under the Toolbox, in particular TM01. References to other  technical measures that may be fully or partially implemented through the implementation of the  measures in the Guideline and this supplement are provided further in this supplement.  1.3 STRUCTURE OF THIS DOCUMENT  This document is structured as follows:  Section 2 contains the necessary background, i.e. a short introduction to cybersecurity of 5G  networks, summarizing the outcomes of the coordinated EU approach for the cybersecurity of  5G networks, listing the critical assets, and key risks identified in the Union-wide risk  assessment and summarizing what is in the EU toolbox on 5G cybersecurity.  Section 3 contains the 5G technology profile which provides supplementary guidance to national  authorities on what are the appropriate security measures for 5G networks. The profile contains  short general guidance and specific guidance for each of the 8 security domains in the  Guideline.  Finally, in Section 4 we briefly discuss some specific technological aspects of 5G networks that  are of particular interest from the cybersecurity point of view. For each of the key technologies  we provide information or references to relevant industry standards and best practices that  competent authorities may want to take in consideration.  1.4 VERSIONS AND CHANGES  ENISA updates the Guideline and this supplement periodically, when necessary, in agreement  with the competent authorities.  This second version of the supplement constitutes a minor update to the initial version  published on 10 December 2020. This update to the supplement has been done in parallel with  an update to the Guideline (now 4th edition).  Main changes in the second version of the supplement:   In line with the 4th edition of the Guideline, updated the name of Security Objective 4 to  ‘Security of third-party dependencies’   Additional security check no. 26 added to Security Objective 14   Amended evidence mapping in Table 13: ‘Additional guidance checklist for domain D6’  5G SUPPLEMENT  July 2021  7  BACKGROUND: 5G RISKS  AND MEASURES  2.1 COORDINATED EU APPROACH TO CYBERSECURITY OF 5G  The European Commission’s Recommendation on the cybersecurity of 5G networks  (hereafter ‘The Recommendation’) published on 26 March, 2019, states that the cybersecurity  of 5G networks is considered critical, to protect the EU’s economy and society and to ensure the  technological sovereignty of the Union. The recommendations called on Member States to  complete national risk assessments and review national measures, to work together at EU level  on a coordinated risk assessment and to prepare a toolbox of possible mitigating measures.  Based on the individual national risk assessments, the Commission and the Member States,  with the support of ENISA, developed a single EU Coordinated Risk Assessment on  Cybersecurity in 5G Networks3 (hereafter ‘Coordinated risk assessment’). This coordinated  risk assessment identifies the main threats and threat actors, the most sensitive assets, the  main vulnerabilities and the main risks. For ease of reference, we re-iterate the main assets, in  section 2.2 and the main risks, in section 2.3.  2.2 TERMINOLOGY AND DEFINITIONS  Terminology and definitions used in this document follows the terminology and definitions in the  Coordinated risk assessment, paragraphs 1.12 and 1.24. For ease of reference, we list them here.  Table 2: Definitions  Term Definition  5G Networks  5G networks means a set of all relevant network infrastructure elements for mobile and wireless  communications technology used for connectivity and value-added services with advanced  performance characteristics such as very high data rates and capacity, low latency communications,  ultra-high reliability, or supporting a high number of connected devices. These may include legacy  networks elements based on previous generations of mobile and wireless communications technology  such as 4G or 3G. 5G networks should be understood to include all relevant parts of the network  Mobile Network  Operators - MNOs4  Entities providing mobile network services5 to users, operating their own network [or] with the help of  third parties6.  Suppliers of MNOs  Entities providing services or infrastructure to MNOs in order to build and/or operate their networks.  This category includes:  ­ Telecom equipment manufacturers;  ­ Other third-party suppliers, such as cloud infrastructure providers, systems integrators, security  and maintenance contractors, transmission equipment manufacturer.  Manufacturers of  connected devices  and related service  providers  Entities providing objects or services that will connect to the 5G networks (e.g. smartphones,  connected vehicles, e-health) and related service components hosted in 5G control plane as defined  in Service Based Architecture or Mobile Edge Computing  3 https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/eu-wide-coordinated-risk-assessment-5g-networks-security  4 In the context of EECC, MNOs are one type of providers of public electronic communications networks or of publicly  available electronic communications services  5 In this document mobile network services refer to 5G networks and hence the corresponding term MNOs is used to  denote entities providing 5G mobile network services  6 The original definition as given in the Coordinated risk assessment reads “entities providing mobile network services to  users, operating their own network with the help of third parties”. To avoid a possible confusion that MNOs always depend  on third parties, an ‘or’ has been added to slightly amend the said definition.  https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/eu-wide-coordinated-risk-assessment-5g-networks-security  5G SUPPLEMENT  July 2021  8  2.3 5G ASSETS  Where references are made in this document to critical or sensitive network component or  functions, the identification of these components or functions should be based on and  consistent with the high-level categorisation of asset sensitivity defined in the Coordinated  risk assessment, paragraph 2.21.  For ease of reference, we reproduce the table from the referenced paragraph 2.21 below.  Table 3: Assets (according to the Coordinated risk assessment)  Categories of elements  and functions  Criticality Examples of key elements  Core network functions CRITICAL  User Equipment Authentication, roaming and Session  Management Functions; User Equipment data transport  functions; Access policy management; Registration and  authorization of network services; Storage of end-user and  network data; Link with third-party mobile networks; Exposure  of core network functions to external applications; Attribution  of end-user devices to network slices  NFV management and  network orchestration  (MANO)  CRITICAL  Management systems and  supporting services  (other than MANO)  MODERATE/HIGH  Security management systems; Billing and other support  systems such as network performance  Radio Access network HIGH Base stations  Transport and  transmission functions  MODERATE/HIGH  Low-level network equipment (routers, switches, etc.); Filtering  equipment (firewalls, IPS...)  Internetwork exchanges MODERATE/HIGH  IP networks external to MNO premises; Network services  provided by third parties  Further details about the listed asset categories is available in paragraphs 2.22 - 2.27 of the Coordinated risk  assessment.  Remark: The above list of assets is a generic, high-level list, looking at the overall elements of 5G architecture. When  identifying specific assets, MNOs are expected to follow the recommended approach from the Guideline and to  perform their own analysis, specific for their particular setting and to determine which specific assets are in scope (see  section 4.1 of the Guideline). With transition to 5G network and services, such asset lists are expected to be updated  in order consider new assets introduced (as also recommended further in section 3) and should ideally be aligned with  the above list of assets, in particular in terms of estimated asset criticality.  2.4 5G RISKS  Coordinated risk assessment identified several main risk categories illustrated by concrete risk scenarios, describing  possible attacks paths that a threat actor can use to reach its target. For ease of reference, we list these risks in the  table below, reproducing the text from the Coordinated risk assessment.  5G SUPPLEMENT  July 2021  9  Table 4: Risks (according to the Coordinated risk assessment)  Risk group Individual risks/risk scenarios  I - Risk scenarios  related to  insufficient  security measures  R1: Misconfiguration of networks: Exploiting poorly configured systems and architecture, a State  actor penetrates into the 5G network via its external interfaces, leading to the compromise of the  network core functions, or exploits edge-computing nodes in order to compromise information  confidentiality and disrupt distributed services.  R2: Lack of access controls: A subcontractor with administrator’s privileges on the network  performs adverse action, leading to confidentiality/integrity and/or availability breach. The  subcontractor’s action may be due to a legal requirement imposed by a third country or rogue  behaviour of the contractor’s staff.  II – Risk scenarios  related to 5G  supply chain  R3: Low product quality: Espionage by state or state-backed actors using malware to abuse poor  quality network components or unintentional vulnerabilities affecting sensitive elements in the core  network, such as Network Virtualisation Functions.  R4: Dependency on any single supplier within individual networks or lack of diversity on nation- wide basis: A mobile network operator sources a large amount of its sensitive network  components or services from a single supplier. The availability of equipment and/or updates from  this supplier is subsequently drastically reduced, due to a failure by the supplier to supply (e.g.  due to trade sanctions by a third State or to other commercial circumstances). In consequence,  the quality of a supplier’s equipment decreases due to priority given to guaranteeing supply over  improvements in product security.  III - Risk scenarios  related to modus  operandi of main  threat actors  R5: State interference through 5G supply chain: A hostile state actor exercises pressure over a  supplier under its jurisdiction to provide access to sensitive network assets through (either  purposefully or unintentionally) embedded vulnerabilities.  R6: Exploitation of 5G networks by organised crime or Organised crime group targeting end- users: By taking control of a critical part of the 5G network architecture, an organized crime group  disrupts various services to ransom businesses relying on those services, or the mobile network  operator itself. Alternatively, using a similar attack path, an organised crime group may also target  end-users, e.g. by injecting false messages to the users of the network as part of a large-scale  “phishing” attack or online scam, or by using the compromised network to gain access to  confidential data about users (e.g. second-factor authentication codes) for further profit.  IV - Risk scenarios  related to  interdependencies  between 5G  networks and other  critical systems  R7: Significant disruption of critical infrastructures or services: Malicious hackers are able to  compromise emergency services by gaining control of their dedicated network slice, thus  compromising the availability of the service and the integrity of the information/data used for/within  that service.  R8: Massive failure of networks due to interruption of electricity supply or other support systems:  Massive outage of power supply due to natural disasters or to attacks to the energy grid by a  state, a state-backed actor or an organised crime group.  V - Risk scenarios  related to end user  devices  R9: IoT (Internet of Things) exploitation: A hacktivist group or state-backed actor takes control of  low security devices like IoT (sensors, home appliances, etc.), in order to attack the network by  overwhelming its signalling plane.  Remark: The above list of risks identified in the Coordinated risk assessment may be seen as a  generic, high-level list of risks that are believed to be relevant for MS across EU. In reality, MNOs are  expected to follow the recommended approach from the Guideline and to perform their own risk  assessment, specific for their particular setting and to determine which specific risks are relevant (see  section 4.1 of the Guideline). With transition to 5G network and services, such risk assessment is  expected to be updated in order consider specific 5G risks (as also recommended further in section 3)  and should ideally be aligned with the above list of risks.  We refer the reader to the ENISA 5G threat landscape7 for a more detailed and more technical  overview of threats for 5G networks.  7 For information about the ENISA Threat Landscape for 5G networks, refer to section 4 and Table 15.  5G SUPPLEMENT  July 2021  10  2.5 MITIGATING MEASURES IN THE 5G CYBERSECURITY TOOLBOX  On 29 January 2020, the NIS Cooperation Group published the EU toolbox of risk mitigating  measures8 (‘the Toolbox’) addressing the risks identified in the coordinated risk assessment.  On the same date, the Commission adopted a Communication (Secure 5G deployment in  the EU - Implementing the EU Toolbox)9, in which it endorsed the Toolbox conclusions and  underlined the importance of their effective and quick implementation and called on Member  States to take concrete steps to implement them.  The Toolbox identifies two groups of measures MS can take: strategic and technical measures  and it also identifies a number of supporting actions that may enable, assist in implementation  or improve effectiveness of the strategic and technical measures.  Figure 2: Toolbox structure  We summarize the strategic and technical measures in the Toolbox in the tables below.  Table 5: List of strategic measures from the Toolbox  Strategic Measures  SM01 Strengthening the role of national authorities  SM02 Performing audits on operators and requiring information  SM03  Assessing the risk profile of suppliers and applying restrictions  for suppliers  considered to be high risk  SM04  Controlling the use of Managed Service Providers (MSPs) and equipment suppliers’  third line support  SM05  Ensuring the diversity of suppliers for individual MNOs through appropriate multi- vendor strategies  SM06 Strengthening the resilience at national level  SM07  Identifying key assets and fostering a diverse and sustainable 5G ecosystem in the  EU  8 https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/cybersecurity-5g-networks-eu-toolbox-risk-mitigating-measures  9 Commission Communication COM (2020)50, Secure 5G deployment in the EU - Implementing the EU toolbox, 29 January  2020, https://ec.europa.eu/newsroom/dae/document.cfm?doc_id=64481  https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/cybersecurity-5g-networks-eu-toolbox-risk-mitigating-measures https://ec.europa.eu/newsroom/dae/document.cfm?doc_id=64481  5G SUPPLEMENT  July 2021  11  Table 6: List of technical measures from the Toolbox  Technical Measures  TM01  Ensuring the application of baseline security requirements (secure net. design and  architecture)  TM02  Ensuring and evaluating the implementation of security measures in existing 5G  standards  TM03 Ensuring strict access controls  TM04 Increasing the security of virtualised network functions  TM05 Ensuring secure 5G network management, operation and monitoring  TM06 Reinforcing physical security  TM07 Reinforcing software integrity, update and patch management  TM08  Raising the security standards in suppliers’ processes through robust procurement  conditions  TM09  Using EU certification for 5G net. components, customer equipment and/or suppliers’  processes  TM10 Using EU certification for other non 5G-specific ICT products and services10  TM11 Reinforcing resilience and continuity plans  Table 7: List of supporting actions from the Toolbox  Supporting Actions  SA01 Reviewing or developing guidelines and best practices on network security  SA02 Reinforcing testing and auditing capabilities at national and EU level  SA03 Supporting and shaping 5G standardisation  SA04  Developing guidance on the implementation of security measures in existing 5G  standards  SA05  Ensuring the application of standard technical and organisational security measures  through specific EU-wide certification scheme  SA06  Exchanging best practices on the implementation of strategic measures, in particular  national frameworks for assessing the risk profile of suppliers  SA07 Improving coordination in incident response and crisis management  SA08  Conducting audits of interdependencies between 5G networks and other critical  services  SA09 Enhancing cooperation, coordination and information sharing mechanisms  SA10  Ensuring 5G deployment projects supported with public funding take into account  cybersecurity risks  10 Connected devices, cloud services  5G SUPPLEMENT  July 2021  12  2.6 GUIDELINE ON SECURITY MEASURES UNDER THE EECC  The ENISA Guideline on Security Measures under the EECC11, referred to as the Guideline,  provides guidance to competent authorities about the technical details of implementing Articles  40 and 41 of the EECC. It gives guidance to authorities on how to ensure that providers assess  risks and take appropriate security measures. It contains a list of 29 high-level security  objectives, grouped in 8 domains. Per security objective it lists detailed security measures which  could be taken by providers to reach the security objective. The measures are grouped in 3  levels of increasing sophistication. The overall structure of security objectives and security  measures is depicted in the diagram below.  Figure 3: Overall structure of the security objectives and security measures  The Guideline is split in 8 security domains:   D1: Governance and risk management   D2: Human resources security   D3: Security of systems and facilities   D4: Operations management   D5: Incident management   D6: Business continuity management   D7: Monitoring, auditing and testing   D8: Threat awareness  The Guideline is technology neutral and the security measures are applicable to different types of networks and  services and different types of electronic communication providers.  11 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/guideline-on-security-measures-under-the-eecc  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/guideline-on-security-measures-under-the-eecc  5G SUPPLEMENT  July 2021  13  5G TECHNOLOGY PROFILE  This section, the 5G technology profile, supplements the Guideline, which is generic and  technology-agnostic, with additional and more specific guidance on 5G by clarifying and refining  the security measures for 5G networks and services.  When supervising MNOs offering 5G networks, competent authorities should ask a number of  high-level, general questions:  1. Does the MNO already have the general security measures in place, such as the  security measures contained in the Guideline on Security Measures under the EECC?  2. Has the MNO updated the risk assessments, asset lists and operational procedures  and has it reinforced general security measures accordingly, as required for the 5G  network deployment and operation?  3. Is the MNO implementing specific security measures from the relevant 5G standards  such as 3GPP12, including the security-relevant optional controls, and does the same  principle also apply to products and equipment that MNO is using in the network?  4. Has the MNO considered the key new technologies of specific relevance for 5G  networks (such as virtualization, slicing, edge computing etc.) in the overall risk  assessment and has it deployed adequate controls for mitigating related risks?  In the rest of this section we provide detailed guidance for competent authorities for each of the  8 security domains, as follows:   For each of the domains we first list all the underlying security objectives;   We then highlight those objectives that may be considered of particular importance for  5G networks and services and we provide a brief rationale for their relevance;   For each of these highlighted objectives we also include a checklist containing  additional elements that competent authorities may consider;   Finally, we include reference to related technical measures from the Toolbox13.  Remark: Taking into account the type of service provided and perceived overall level of risk,  competent authorities may want to consider requesting the implementation of measure up to  level 3, in particular for those security objectives identified (in the step #2 above) to be of  particular importance. However, it is ultimately up to the competent authorities to choose the  appropriate sophistication levels, taking in consideration also the guidance provided in section  4.2 of the Guideline (Remark on minimum security measures).  12 When assessing the implementation of security controls from the 3GPP standards, competent authorities may find useful  to refer to the reference list provided in Annex II of this supplement.  13 In addition, Annex III of this supplement includes a mapping table between the (supplemented) Guideline security  domains and related technical measures from the Toolbox that are being addressed through the implementation of related  measures and supplementary guidance, in addition to the baseline measure TM01 which pertains to all security domains  5G SUPPLEMENT  July 2021  14  3.1 DOMAIN D1: GOVERNANCE AND RISK MANAGEMENT  Domain D1 (Governance and risk management) covers the following security objectives:   SO 1: Information security policy   SO 2: Governance and risk management   SO 3: Security roles and responsibilities   SO 4: Security of third-party dependencies  This security domain is important to ensure that MNOs have appropriate measures and  processes in place to manage information security risks continuously and adequately. It is of  particular importance to ensure that the list of risks is reviewed and updated to consider key  risks specific to 5G networks, especially those identified in the Coordinated risk assessment and  that adequate technical measures are in place for mitigating supply-chain risks pertaining to 5G  networks. Depending on the national approach in respect of assessment of high-risk supplier  (as per the Toolbox measure SM03), this may also include requirements for MNOs to conduct  an assessment of the risk profile of their key suppliers, say in relation to the last criteria  mentioned in the Coordinated risk assessment: The overall quality of products and  cybersecurity practices of the supplier, including the degree of control over its own supply chain  and whether adequate prioritisation is given to security practices. Some of the guidance listed  further in this section includes examples of checks that could be considered in this regard14.  Competent authorities should pay close attention to objectives SO 2 (Governance and risk  management) and SO 4 (Security of third-party dependencies), checking that measures  under these objectives are implemented and considering additional checks as suggested in the  tables below. This addresses Toolbox measures TM08 and, to some extent, TM09 and TM10.  Table 8: Additional guidance checklist for domain D1  # SO Checks to consider Ref.15  1 SO2  Is the list of identified risks aligned with the main risks for 5G networks identified in the Coordinated  risk assessment?  [a,e] [i,vi]  2 SO2  Are threats related to the exposure to potentially high-risk suppliers or managed service providers,  including those residing in other jurisdictions, taken in consideration?  [a,e] [i,vi]  3 SO2  Has a potential dependency on a single supplier of 5G equipment been considered when assessing  the main risks for security of networks and services?  [a,e] [i,vi]  4 SO4  Does MNO have security requirements placed on third parties as part of contractual arrangements &  is there a mechanism to monitor that suppliers are meeting said contractual arrangements?  [e] [vi]  5 SO4  Does MNO require suppliers to comply with relevant EU certification schemes for 5G network  components, customer equipment and/or suppliers’ processes or for other non 5G-specific ICT  products and services, such as end-user devices and/or cloud services16?  [e] [vi]  6 SO4  Does MNO require suppliers to demonstrate quality level of internal information security processes,  including having security by design, built in the product development process?  [e] [vi]  7 SO4  Does MNO require suppliers to adhere to best practices and industry standards throughout the  lifetime of the product?  [e] [vi]  14  In addition, competent authorities may also want to explore and make use, if appropriate, of a concept of supplier  trustworthiness, as applied in some MS. For example, according to Annex 2 of Germany's security catalogue  (https://ec.europa.eu/growth/tools- databases/tris/de/index.cfm/search/?trisaction=search.detail&year=2020&num=496&mLang=EN), public  telecommunications network operators and providers of publicly accessible telecommunications services with increased  criticality are required to, in particular, appropriately select manufacturers and sellers or suppliers of critical components  before purchasing them. An appropriate selection also includes an appropriate examination of the supply source’s  trustworthiness. The obligated company must obtain a comprehensive declaration from the supply source to demonstrate  its trustworthiness. The declaration must relate to all safety-relevant components and, if applicable, functionalities, as well  as the supply source itself (the manufacturer, including the supplier, and, if applicable, the seller or supplier).  15 Here, and further in this section, the reference in the last column of a checklist table refers to the corresponding  measure(s) and related evidence(s) in the Guideline that are most relevant for the check suggested and is provided in the  following format: [measure id] [evidence id]  16 When an EU certification schemes are not available, other interim solutions, such as reliance on certification schemes  based on industry standards, could be considered instead.  https://ec.europa.eu/growth/tools-databases/tris/de/index.cfm/search/?trisaction=search.detail&year=2020&num=496&mLang=EN https://ec.europa.eu/growth/tools-databases/tris/de/index.cfm/search/?trisaction=search.detail&year=2020&num=496&mLang=EN  5G SUPPLEMENT  July 2021  15  # SO Checks to consider Ref.15  8 SO4  Does MNO require suppliers to provide support for periodic security and penetration testing of its  products?  [e] [vi]  9 SO4  Does MNO require suppliers to guarantee there are no intentionally introduced vulnerabilities in their  products and to disclose and patch any known vulnerabilities17 in their products without undue delay?  [e] [vi]  10 SO4  Does MNO require suppliers to have implemented security requirements of relevant 5G technical  specifications and industry standards by default18?  [e] [vi]  11 SO4  Does MNO require suppliers to guarantee adequate protection and non-disclosure of confidential  information from or about its customers to third parties, in particular to foreign intelligence or security  authorities?  [e] [vi]  12 SO4 Does MNO require suppliers to support MNO in investigating and remedying security incidents19?  [e] [vi]  When reviewing and refining requirements for MNOs related to procurement (in relation to the  above highlighted security objective SO 4 - Security of third-party dependencies), competent  authorities may also find useful to explore to technical reports and best practices related to  security requirements for ICT procurement, such as the two ENISA reports listed below.  Document Year Description URL  Indispensable baseline  security requirements  for the procurement of  secure ICT products  and services  ENISA,  2016  Short, practical, technologically neutral document  with clear, simple and sector-agnostic minimum  necessary indispensable requirements for secure  ICT products and services.  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/pu blications/indispensable- baseline-security-requirements- for-the-procurement-of-secure- ict-products-and-services  Security Guide for ICT  Procurement for  electronic  communications  service providers  ENISA,  2014  Practical tool for individual providers to better  manage security risks when dealing with vendors  of ICT products and outsourced services.

This could be of particular  importance in the context of 5G networks, with increased reliance on sub-contractors, including  those from third countries, for the purpose of managing critical network functions. Moreover,  adequate knowledge of key personnel is relevant for addressing one of the important  vulnerabilities identified in the coordinated EU risk assessment, which applies particularly to  17 In the case of vulnerabilities disclosed by the suppliers, competent authorities may also want to ensure that MNOs  disclose such vulnerabilities to them  18 Including all 3GPP optional security features of direct relevance for 5G network security  19 Security should ideally be a shared responsibility between MNOs and suppliers.  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/indispensable-baseline-security-requirements-for-the-procurement-of-secure-ict-products-and-services https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/indispensable-baseline-security-requirements-for-the-procurement-of-secure-ict-products-and-services https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/indispensable-baseline-security-requirements-for-the-procurement-of-secure-ict-products-and-services https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/indispensable-baseline-security-requirements-for-the-procurement-of-secure-ict-products-and-services https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/indispensable-baseline-security-requirements-for-the-procurement-of-secure-ict-products-and-services https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/security-guide-for-ict-procurement https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/security-guide-for-ict-procurement https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/security-guide-for-ict-procurement  5G SUPPLEMENT  July 2021  16  MNOs: lack of specialised and trained personnel to secure, monitor and maintain 5G networks  and services.  Competent authorities should pay close attention to objectives SO 5 (Background checks) and  SO 6 (Security knowledge and training), checking that measures under these objectives are  implemented and considering additional checks as suggested in the tables below. This  addresses Toolbox measures TM05 and TM06.  Table 9: Additional guidance checklist for domain D2  # SO Checks to consider Ref.  1 SO5  Does the list of personnel for whom background checks/screening has been performed also include  contractors and third-party suppliers?  [b] [ii]  2 SO5  Are personnel who will have access (either physically or through management systems) to critical or  sensitive components of 5G networks security-vetted (as stipulated in the provisions of the Toolbox  technical measure TM06)?  [b] [ii]  3 SO6 Has the training program been updated to include coverage of specialized 5G technical topics? [d] [iv]  4 SO6  Is there an evidence that the key personnel who will be in charge of deploying and operating 5G  networks have followed the updated training courses?  [d] [v]  5 SO6  Is there an evidence that personnel who will have access (either physically or through management  systems) to critical or sensitive network components are trained and qualified (as stipulated in the  provisions of the Toolbox technical measure TM06)?  [d] [v]  3.3 DOMAIN D3: SECURITY OF SYSTEMS AND FACILITIES  Domain D3 (Security of systems and facilities) covers the following security objectives:   SO 9: Physical and environmental security   SO 10: Security of supplies   SO 11: Access control to network and information systems   SO 12: Integrity of network and information systems   SO 13: Use of encryption   SO 14: Protection of security-critical data  These security objectives contain various controls for ensuring physical and logical security of  networks and systems. For this reason the domain D3 plays perhaps a central role in ensuring  technical protection of critical or sensitive network components or functions, since majority of  technical risks identified in the Coordinated risk assessment and, subsequently, majority of  related technical measures identified in the Toolbox, are related precisely to physical and logical  security of 5G networks and related information systems and facilities.  Competent authorities should therefore pay close attention to objectives SO 9 (Physical and  environmental security), SO 11 (Access control to network and information systems), SO  12 (Integrity of network and information systems), SO 13 (Use of encryption) and SO 14  (Protection of security-critical data under this domain), checking that measures under these  objectives are implemented and considering some of the additional checks as suggested in the  tables below. This addresses Toolbox measures TM03, TM06 and TM07 and is related to the  Toolbox measures TM02 and TM04.  5G SUPPLEMENT  July 2021  17  Table 10: Additional guidance checklist for domain D3  # SO Checks to consider Ref.  1 SO9  Are there documented, additional, risk-based controls for physical security for MEC and base  stations included in the policy for physical security measures?  [d] [ii,iv]  2 SO9  Are there documented additional, adequate physical infrastructure controls (for example perimeter  security for infrastructure and administrative premises, alarms and CCTV for detecting and recording  incidents), especially for equipment locations which are unmanned, in place?  [d] [ii,iv]  3 SO9  Are there any controls in place to allow failsafe remote shutdown (or data clearing) for stolen  equipment and/or to require re-authentication or configuration after a physical attack or power failure  at base stations?  [d] [ii,iv]  4 SO9  Is there an evidence that access controls are in place for individuals accessing premises, including  assurance that they are security-vetted, trained and qualified and that any access, especially by third  parties and contractors is strictly monitored?  [d] [ii,iv]  5 SO9  Do physical security controls included in the policy for physical security measures cover (multi- vendor) spare part management, at least for critical assets?  [b] [ii]  6 SO11  Are there any additional strict network access controls applied according to the updated risk  assessment that particularly considers 5G network architecture elements?  [f] [vii]  7 SO11  Is there an evidence demonstrating how the principle of least privilege is applied (including the  explanation on how various rights in the network, such as access rights between network functions,  network administrators’ rights and alike are minimized)?  [f] [vi]  8 SO11 Is there an evidence showing how the principle of segregation of duties is applied? [f] [vi]  9 SO11  Is there an evidence that the access control policy has been reviewed and revised in the context of  assessment of 5G risks?  [c,h] [iii,xi]  10 SO11  Does the (revised) access control policy include provisions for restricting and/or strict controlling of  remote access by third parties, especially by suppliers or managed service providers considered to  be high-risk or accessing the network from outside of EU?  [c,h] [iii,iv]  11 SO11  Do authentication mechanisms implemented follow general good practices and industry standards  for strong authentication?  [d] [iii,iv,vii]  12 SO11  Are there controls in place to only allow temporary access to third parties and/or remote access and  that no permanent credentials are granted (e.g. temporary or one-time passwords, usable only for  designated tasks)?  [d] [iii,iv,vii]  13 SO11 Is there a centralised solution for Privileged Access Management (PAM) in place20? [d] [vii]  14 SO12  Do software patching procedures follow industry standard best practices for ensuring that software  products or components have not been altered (e.g. appropriate cryptographic methods for integrity  and authenticity protection)?  [d] [vi,vii]  15 SO12  Are there documented and tested processes for delivery and implementation of security patches to  vulnerable components?  [d] [iii]  16 SO12  Are there appropriate physical protection mechanisms in place to ensure that hardware product have  not been tampered with (e.g. physical security protection for equipment transport)21?  [c,d] [iii]  17 SO12  Are there specific timeframes for applying security patches to vulnerable components, particularly in  the case of high and critical vulnerabilities22?

If interpreted in its wider meaning, as pertaining to general integrity of network and  information systems, then securing hardware devices that contain data or that ultimately will be running embedded software  themselves, could be considered in the scope. Alternative mappings of this check could be considered, such as related it to  SO 10 – Security of supplies (although supplies in this context pertain more to utilities such as power supply), to SO 4 –  Security of third-party dependencies (if the obligation is defined for suppliers) or even SO 9 – Physical security (if assets not  yet deployed within the network are included in the scope).  22  E.g.

[a] [ii]  26 SO14  Where cryptographic key material is stored on third party key servers, are there appropriate  contractual arrangements in place with the server provider to ensure security of this key material?  [a,b] [i]  3.4 DOMAIN D4: OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT  Domain D4 (Operations management) covers the following security objectives:   SO 15: Operational procedures   SO 16: Change management   SO 17: Asset management  Considering the technical complexity and increased softwarization of key elements of 5G  network infrastructure, it is of particular importance that MNOs have good and up-to-date  operational procedures in place, in particular related to asset management, to understand the  critical assets, and to have solid change management mechanisms in place.  Competent authorities should therefore pay close attention to objectives SO 16 (Change  management) and SO 17 (Asset management), checking that measures under these  objectives are implemented and considering additional checks as suggested in the tables below.  This address Toolbox measure TM07.  Table 11: Additional guidance checklist for domain D4  # SO Checks to consider Ref.  1 SO16  Are there regular assessments of potential impact of an intended change prior to major system  changes, especially when critical or sensitive network components are about to be updated?  [all] [ii,iv]  2 SO16  Is there a mechanism in place to ensure that any major actual change implemented, especially for  critical or sensitive network components, is recorded and any irregularities encountered during the  change process are investigated and, if incident reporting conditions are met, reported to competent  authorities?  [all] [ii,iv]  3 SO16  Are changes to virtualised network environment (e.g. through patching of software defined network  components) included in the change management policies and procedures?  [b,d] [ii,iv]  4 SO16  Has MNO given consideration to moving to software development lifecycle best practices such as  Agile, Continuous Integration/Continuous Development (CI/CD), and DevSecOps, given 5G’s shift to  a software based network?  [b,d] [ii,iv]  5 SO17  Is asset criticality assessment aligned with the list of critical assets identified in the Coordinated risk  assessment?  [b,c] [ii,v]  6 SO17  Has the MNO established relevant information repositories/registries containing details about  deployed technologies and components and are such registries appropriately maintained (e.g. timely  updates upon changes to the network)?  [b,c] [ii,v]  7 SO17  Are there mechanisms envisaged in the MNO policies/procedures for asset management for  conducting regular assessments of their physical assets and for categorisation of their physical  network assets (e.g. core network assets, transmission hubs, exchanges, base-stations,  [b,c] [ii,v]  26 Even when transferred from the UICC manufacturer to the MNO  27 This may include (but Is not limited to) cryptographic key material for remote SIM provisioning, for operating the N32  interface and DIAMETER or for the operation of the SIP infrastructure  5G SUPPLEMENT  July 2021  19  # SO Checks to consider Ref.  interconnection and transport links) based on a risk assessment and according to the assets  sensitivity/criticality.  8 SO17  Have policies/procedures for asset management been updated to reflect the fact that 5G networks  will likely be virtualised, with VNFs being instantiated and decommissioned in an automated way and  do such updates include sufficient provisions to ensure good understanding of the virtual network,  including data flows, trust domains and the location and status of the physical hosts on which the  virtual network resides?  [b,c] [ii,v]  3.5 DOMAIN D5: INCIDENT MANAGEMENT  Domain D5 (Incident management) covers the following security objectives:   SO 18: Incident management procedures   SO 19: Incident detection capability   SO 20: Incident reporting and communication  Technological complexity of new generation mobile networks, potential dependency on  suppliers and/or managed service providers that provide equipment and/or services, sometimes  using remote connections from third countries and the overall complexity of the threat landscape  require mature incident management capabilities, including state of the art incident detection  capabilities. Moreover, comprehensive and reliable reporting on incidents that had a significant  impact on operations of 5G networks and services to relevant competent authorities is equally  important.  Competent authorities should therefore pay close attention to objectives SO 19 (Incident  detection capability) and SO 20 (Incident reporting and communication), checking that  measures under these objectives are implemented and considering additional checks as  suggested in the tables below. This addresses Toolbox measure TM05.  Table 12: Additional guidance checklist for domain D5  # SO Checks to consider Ref.  1 SO19  Are relevant logs related to remote network access regularly reviewed according to predefined  procedures?  [d] [v]  2 SO19 Are there capabilities for anomaly detection in place? [b] [ii]  3 SO19  Is the monitoring infrastructure28 implemented according to the recommendation from the Toolbox,  including whether such monitoring infrastructure is established on premise, ideally inside the country  or inside the EU29?  [c] [iii]  4 SO19  Does MNO have adequate resources available to monitor, understand and analyse security-related  network activity?  [b] [ii]  5 SO20 Does MNO comply with relevant incident reporting provisions within a given legal framework? [c] [iv]  3.6 DOMAIN D6: BUSINESS CONTINUITY MANAGEMENT  Domain D6 (Business continuity management) covers the following security objectives:   SO 21: Service continuity strategy and contingency plans   SO 22: Disaster recovery capabilities  28 such as Network Operation Centres (NOC) and/or Security Operation Centres (SOC), that can serve for the purpose of  timely detection of significant events or incidents  29 This follows the general requirement as identified in the Toolbox technical measure TM05, implementation on MS level  may vary  5G SUPPLEMENT  July 2021  20  Implementation of measures under this domain ensures robust network resilience and adequate  disaster recovery and business continuity capabilities. And while this may already be essential  part of MNO’s operations, it is worth emphasizing its importance in the context of 5G networks,  as indicated in both the Coordinated risk assessment and the Toolbox. In the Coordinated risk  assessment, a massive failure of networks due to interruption of electricity supply or other  support systems is explicitly highlighted as one of the 9 identified significant risks to 5G  networks. Consequently, the Toolbox technical measure TM11 calls MNOs to further strengthen  the corresponding resilience and continuity plans.  Competent authorities should pay close attention to objectives SO 21 (Service continuity  strategy and contingency plans) and SO 22 (Disaster recovery capabilities), checking that  measures under these objectives are implemented and considering additional checks as  suggested in the tables below. This addresses Toolbox technical measure TM11.  Table 13: Additional guidance checklist for domain D6  # SO Checks to consider Ref.  1 SO21  Are there measures in place to ensure supply-chain resilience (e.g. by ensuring that contingency  plans consider scenarios of removal of critical suppliers30, understanding the related impact and  having appropriate failback strategies in place)?  [b] [ii]  2 SO21  Are there any special provisions added to existing contingency plans to cover time-critical  applications of 5G services, such as URLLC as to ensure higher network availability for such  services?  [b] [ii]  3 SO21  Is there a map of critical dependencies that may directly or indirectly impact availability or continuity  of 5G network service and if corresponding mitigation measures are defined and documented?  [d] [v]  4 SO21  Is there a map of critical sectors and services directly dependent on the continuity of network and  service operations and if criticality of such systems is taken in consideration in contingency plans?  [d] [v]  5 SO22  Are there documented plans in place in case of a disaster affecting the ongoing operation of the  MNO’s network?  [b] [ii]  3.7 DOMAIN D7: MONITORING, AUDITING AND TESTING  Domain D7, Monitoring, auditing and testing, covers the following security objectives:   SO 23: Monitoring and logging policies   SO 24: Exercise contingency plans   SO 25: Network and information system testing   SO 26: Security assessments   SO 27: Compliance monitoring  In addition to having robust incident detection and management capabilities in place, as  discussed earlier, having sophisticated monitoring and logging capabilities is of significant  importance for detecting and analysing security incidents. This may particularly be relevant for  the environments where remote access to critical or sensitive network components or functions  is expected and especially when such access is to be established from third countries and/or  from suppliers or service providers considered to be high-risk. Coordinated risk assessment, in  particular, identifies lack of adequate monitoring practices in MNOs as one of the key  vulnerabilities. Consequently, the need for strict monitoring and logging is emphasized in  Toolbox technical measure TM05 as well as in the technical measure TM03.  At the same time, considering the increased virtualization and softwarization, the importance of  testing and security assessments may be higher in 5G networks. Although not explicitly  30 Say, due to trade sanctions, market conditions or similar  5G SUPPLEMENT  July 2021  21  mentioned in the Toolbox, this is implicitly related to some of the technical measures, in  particular to the technical measure TM0731.  Finally, having the appropriate compliance monitoring in place ensures continuous compliance  with relevant standards and in the context of 5G this could also ensure compliance with relevant  5G standards, such as 3GPP, as requested by the Toolbox (technical measure TM02).  Competent authorities should therefore pay close attention to objectives SO 23 (Monitoring  and logging policies), SO25 (Network and information system testing), SO 26 (Security  assessments) and SO 27 (Compliance monitoring), checking that measures under these  objectives are implemented and considering additional checks as suggested in the tables below.  This addresses Toolbox measures TM03, TM05 and TM07 and is related to the Toolbox  measures TM02 and TM04.  Table 14: Additional guidance checklist for domain D7  # SO Checks to consider Ref.  1 SO23  Are there adequate monitoring capabilities in place in line with the recommendations form the  Toolbox technical measure TM05, to ensure providing clear visibility and to implement effective  network monitoring of at least the critical or sensitive network components or functions, to detect  anomalies and to identify and avoid threats, including but not limited to threats to 5G core coming  from compromised end-user devices?  [b,c] [iii,iv]  2 SO23  Does the monitoring and logging policy also include monitoring of VPN and remote access to 5G  network from remote locations32?  [b,c] [ii]  3 SO23  Is there monitoring in place for roaming and interconnections (e.g. message monitoring and filtering  capabilities to identify and block malformed, prohibited and unauthorised packets, confirm that  interfaces are only accessible to the correct external applications and/or networks and enabling of  audit logging and delivery of data to SIEM for analysis for relevant threat vectors)?  [b,c] [iii,iv]  4 SO25  Are all patches, especially those to critical or sensitive network components or functions, subjected  to security testing in controlled environment prior to deployment?  [a,d] [i,iii]  5 SO26  Are security tests, vulnerability assessments/scans and penetration tests done on deployment and  subsequently, on periodic basis, for newly deployed network components, in particular for products  supplied by suppliers considered to be high-risk?

Therefore, it is important that  competent authorities ensure implementation and audit of relevant measures from the  corresponding Guideline security objectives, taking in consideration additional guidance  provided in this supplement, where applicable.  However, there are some specific vulnerabilities related to these technologies, which MNOs  would have to take in consideration when doing a risk assessment. Consequently, the identified  risks need to be addressed adequately, which in some cases may require implementation of  additional security controls.  In this section, we provide further high-level information about some of these underlying  technologies and we highlight the most relevant security aspects. We also include reference  lists with pointers to the relevant industry standards and best practices for each of these  technologies.  A more detailed technical information about the listed technologies and their security aspects,  including the architecture, assets, security considerations and threats can be found it the  comprehensive ENISA threat landscape for 5G Networks39 (hereinafter ‘ETL5G’). The new  version of the report (currently in preparation) also brings analysis of vulnerabilities and  identification of related security controls.  Table 16: ENISA Threat Landscape for 5G Networks  Document Body Description URL  ENISA Threat  Landscape for  5G networks  2019  ENISA  The 2019 report drew an initial threat landscape  and presented an overview of the challenges in the  security of 5G networks.

The main benefits of the NFV technology  are scalability and better utilisation of network resources; reduced power consumption and  improved efficiency of space usage; and reduced operational and capital expenditures.  The main elements of the NFV architecture are:   Virtual Network Functions (VNFs);   NFV Infrastructure (NFVI); and   Management, Automation and Network Orchestration (MANO) layer.  The latter, MANO, is also identified as a critical asset in the EU coordinated risk assessment.  A more detailed technical information about the NFV architecture can be found in ETL5G. The  same report also identifies the key virtualisation threats, being the following:   Abuse on Data Centres Interconnect (DCI) protocol   Abuse of cloud computational resources   Network virtualisation bypassing   Virtualised host abuse  The closely related technology is Software Defined Networks (SDN). It allows dynamic  management of network resources by separating the network control plane from the data plane.  This enables a directly programmable network control and an abstracted underlying  infrastructure for applications and network services. A logically centralised control plane allows  a network wide view of data plane network elements. This can then be exposed to the  application layer to achieve simplified network management and improved agility. ETL5G  identifies and explains number of control plane, data plane and API related vulnerabilities in  SDN.  Another related concept of relevance is containerisation. Containerisation is essentially a  simplified form of virtualisation, whereby instead of running an entire operating system virtually  only the user-space elements of the host OS are separated from each other and the hosting  operating system. This gives all the advantages of full virtualisation but without the overhead of  running the full guest OS, thus leading to greater efficiencies, although it does require that each  container presents the same OS version to all applications (i.e. identical instances of the host  OS). The efficiency and reliability gains greatly increase the portability of such containers and  the ability to move entire application stacks within a virtualised environment has been made of  great use for application development. The table 16 (below) includes references to documents  that cover security aspects of containerisation in more detail.  In addition to ensuring the implementation of general security measures from the Guideline and  taking in consideration additional guidance provided in the chapter 3 of this supplement,  competent authorities may also want to check that relevant network virtualisation security risks  are included in MNO’s security assessment and that MNOs follow industry standards and best  practices, in particular relevant ETSI NFV. We list the most relevant41 ETSI technical  specifications and additional relevant technical reports and documents, including two ENISA  publications on SDN and virtualization security in the following table.  40 https://searchnetworking.techtarget.com/definition/network-functions-virtualization-NFV  41 The list of ETSI NFV-SEC specifications given in the table does not include all the specification document, but only  selected ones, that are believed to be of most relevance in terms of identifying specific detailed technical controls that could  be considered for securing NFV.

The objective is to provide a set of optimised resources and  network topology to satisfy the needs of use cases (for example, connectivity, speed, latency  and capacity) and conform to a specific service level agreement. As NFV, MEC and SDN, the  network slicing concept is also built on virtual networking architecture where multiple virtual  networks are established using shared physical infrastructure. Using common network  resources (e.g. storage and processors), network slices can be created to establish a logical  and self-contained network configured and connected end-to-end.  A detailed technical information about the network slicing architecture can be found in ETL5G.  The same report also identifies the key areas network slicing vulnerabilities42 (Security-as-a-  Service, Resource isolation, Secure Management and Orchestration and Trust Model) and  provides further explanations related to these vulnerabilities.  In addition to ensuring the implementation of general security measures from the Guideline and  taking in consideration additional guidance provided in the section 3 of this supplement,  competent authorities also may want to check that relevant network slicing security risks are  included in MNO’s security assessment and that MNOs follow industry standards and best  practices for securing network slicing. We list some of the relevant technical documents in the  table below.

Multi-access Edge Computing (MEC) is a technology aiming to satisfy the  requirements of high-bandwidth and low-latency applications which operate at the edge of the  network43. MEC is based on the convergence of IT and telecommunications networking. Key  benefits are reduced network congestion and improved performance for low latency  applications. The ability of storing, processing and delivering content locally without requiring  backhauling and centralised core network is the main feature of the technology.  Deployment of MEC technology as part of an NFV environment is envisaged. Therefore,  security requirements of MEC enabled applications are expected to be addressed within the  42 Vulnerability analysis is include in the ETL5G only in the 2020 report version (currently in preparation)  43 Based on: https://www.sdxcentral.com/edge/definitions/what-multi-access-edge-computing-mec/  https://portal.3gpp.org/desktopmodules/Specifications/SpecificationDetails.aspx?specificationId=3358 https://portal.3gpp.org/desktopmodules/Specifications/SpecificationDetails.aspx?specificationId=3358 https://portal.3gpp.org/desktopmodules/Specifications/SpecificationDetails.aspx?specificationId=3358 https://portal.3gpp.org/desktopmodules/Specifications/SpecificationDetails.aspx?specificationId=3358 https://portal.3gpp.org/desktopmodules/Specifications/SpecificationDetails.aspx?specificationId=3541 https://portal.3gpp.org/desktopmodules/Specifications/SpecificationDetails.aspx?specificationId=3541 https://portal.3gpp.org/desktopmodules/Specifications/SpecificationDetails.aspx?specificationId=3541 https://www.sdxcentral.com/edge/definitions/what-multi-access-edge-computing-mec/  5G SUPPLEMENT  July 2021  27  NFV security framework. Security fundamentals including data encryption, network visibility,  automated monitoring and access control based on the principle of least privilege and supported  by intrusion prevention and detection are all applicable to the MEC platform. Threats include  infrastructure attacks related to wireless technology vulnerabilities (e.g. denial of service attacks  to consume the bandwidth and computing resources at the edge or man in the middle attacks to  inject or eavesdrop traffic from the edge), virtualisation attacks (e.g. denial of service and man in  the middle attacks by rogue virtual machines) and privacy leakage (e.g. unauthorised access to  information storage in the edge cloud).  A more detailed technical information about the MEC architecture can be found it ETL5G. The  same report also identifies and described the key MEC threats (e.g. a false or rogue MEC  gateway, edge node overload and abuse of edge open APIs) as well as the key areas of  vulnerabilities44 (vulnerabilities related to virtualization and containerization, physical security,  APIs and regulatory issues) and provides further explanations related to these vulnerabilities.  In addition to ensuring the implementation of general security measures from the Guideline and  taking in consideration additional guidance provided in the chapter 3 of this supplement,  competent authorities may want to check that relevant edge computing security risks are  included in MNO’s security assessment and that MNOs follow industry standards and best  practices, in particular relevant technical specifications and reports from ETSI, as a leading  organization in standardization of MEC technology45.

Similarly, software tampering of the  MEC platform should be prevented. To achieve this, platform security, platform  management security, data storage and transmission security need to be enhanced as well  as introducing trusted computing technologies.   An increased number of entry points in the MEC environment (e.g. IoT use case) implies  challenging attack surface and complex certificate management as the absence or  weakness of security measures in MEC devices can be exploited and create vulnerabilities  for the whole network. Ensuring real-time network visibility is one of the key considerations.   Robust authentication and authorisation procedures need to be in place for the MEC  platform which is located much closer to access network than the core network. The key  issue is how to establish a uniform level of security policies for all MEC elements to  minimise the risks.   In terms of network resilience, the introduction of the MEC platform should not affect  network availability. This means that MEC solution vendors should offer the level of  resilience to meet high-availability requirements of network operators. An appropriate  failsafe mechanism should be in place to prevent the MEC platform failure from adversely  affecting the normal operation of the network.  46 Based on: https://www.etsi.org/images/files/ETSIWhitePapers/etsi_wp20ed2_MEC_SoftwareDevelopment.pdf,  https://www.sdxcentral.com/edge/definitions/mec-security/ , https://www.gsma.com/futurenetworks/wp- content/uploads/2020/02/6_Smart-Port-MEC-Security-Application-Based-on-5G-SA_GSMA.pdf,  https://innovationatwork.ieee.org/edge-computing-security-issues-and-trends-to-watch-in-2020/ .

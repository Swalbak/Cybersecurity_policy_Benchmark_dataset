If we do not ensure  that cybersecurity capacity exists across the entirety of  cyberspace, we will inevitably create cyber-ghettos. In such  environments, cyber-harm may become prevalent and cyber- attacks can easily be launched. The ability of countries to  respond and grow capacity in the face of changing threats  – be they due to trends in technology use, the socio-political  climate, or evolution of the threat-actor ecosystem – has  never been more important.  The Cybersecurity Capacity Maturity Model for Nations  (CMM) helps nations understand what works, what  does not work and why, across all areas of cybersecurity  capacity. This is important so that governments and  enterprises can adopt policies and make investments that  have the potential to significantly enhance safety and  security in cyberspace, while also respecting human rights,  such as privacy and freedom of expression.  Since 2015, the Global Cyber Security Capacity Centre  (GCSCC, Capacity Centre) has actively promoted the CMM  across sectors, to drive conversation around cybersecurity  capacity and to help improve global technology. The  resulting adoption of the CMM by various key international  stakeholders, and the completion of more than 120 CMM  reviews in more than 85 countries around the world,  demonstrates the positive impact of the research, supports  government self-assessments and informs the development  of industry tools and resources.  Prompted by the changing threat landscape and  corresponding cybersecurity practice, the GCSCC has led a  revision of the CMM, the first to be carried out since the  2016 edition was issued. To produce this 2021 edition, the  Executive Summary Capacity Centre undertook a global collaborative exercise  aimed at extracting and synthesising the community’s latest  knowledge. The GCSCC developed change proposals based  on lessons learned from CMM deployments, and undertook  a series of online and offline consultations with experts, to  validate the findings and discuss the changes. Those who  were consulted included the GCSCC Expert Advisory Panel,  strategic, regional and implementation partners of the  GCSCC, and other experts from academia, international and  regional organisations, governments, the private sector, and  civil society. Based on their input, indicators for each Aspect  have been identified, designed, refined, and validated.  Actors around the world, ranging from individuals to nation  states, need to ensure that cyberspace and the systems  dependent on it are resilient to increasing attacks. The  CMM 2021 Edition and its deployment will continue to  contribute towards efforts to achieve this resilience, not only  by gaining a more profound understanding of international  cybersecurity capacity, but also by increasing effective  investment into cybersecurity capacity based on a rigorous  analysis of data collected from the deployment of the  model. Critical gaps in all areas of international cybersecurity  will be identified and filled with scalable and effective  countermeasures, in co-operation with international  partners from the global cybersecurity community.  The enhancement of the CMM is not intended to be a  static exercise; a continuous process of refinement will  be maintained to ensure the CMM remains applicable  to all national contexts and reflects the global state of  cybersecurity capacity maturity. However, this evolution  will continue to be a considered exercise, stimulated by  evidence and practice.

The output is an evidence- based report which:  • benchmarks the maturity of a country’s cybersecurity  capacity;  • details a pragmatic set of actions to contribute to the  advancement of cybersecurity capacity maturity gaps; and  • identifies priorities for investment and future capacity- building, based on a country’s specific needs.  According to an independent study commissioned by the  UK Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office, the  benefits of a CMM review for a country are numerous and  include:  • increased cybersecurity awareness and capacity building,  and greater collaboration within government;  • networking and collaboration with business and wider  society;  A National Cybersecurity  Assessment with the CMM  • the enhancement of the internal credibility of the  cybersecurity agenda within governments;  • help in defining roles and responsibilities within  governments;  • providing evidence to increase funding for cybersecurity  capacity building; and  • a foundation for country strategy and policy development.  It is important that a country can evidence its achievements  in cybersecurity capacity and the CMM identifies what that  evidence should be, and what it demonstrates. Such evidence  gathering is in itself a multi-stakeholder process, involving a  wide range of sources and organisations. Discussions can be  important to resolve differences of opinion. Whether such  discussions can be effective if done remotely (and online), or  will necessitate face-to-face meetings, will depend upon the  country undertaking a review.

Developing cybersecurity policy and strategy;  2. Encouraging responsible cybersecurity culture within society;  3. Building cybersecurity knowledge and capabilities;  4. Creating effective legal and regulatory frameworks; and  5. Controlling risks through standards and technologies.  The Dimensions  of National  Cybersecurity  Capacity  Cybersecurity Policy  and Strategy  Start-up Stage Formative Stage Established Stage Strategic Stage Dynamic Stage  Dimension 1  Cybersecurity Culture  and Society  Dimension 2  Building Cybersecurity  Knowledge and  Capabilities  Dimension 3  Standards and  Technologies  Dimension 5  Cybersecurity Policy  and Strategy  Dimension 1  Cybersecurity Culture  and Society  Dimension 2  Building Cybersecurity  Knowledge and  Capabilities  Dimension 3  Legal and  Regulatory  Frameworks  Dimension 4  Standards and  Technologies  Dimension 5  Dimension 1 Cybersecurity Policy  and Strategy  Dimension 2 Cybersecurity  Culture and Society  Dimension 3 Building Cybersecurity  Knowledge and  Capabilities  Dimension 5 Standards and  Technologies  Legal and  Regulatory  Frameworks  Dimension 4  Dimension 4 Legal and Regulatory  Frameworks  5 Cybersecurity Capacity Maturity Model for Nations (CMM) - 2021 Edition  D3  D4  D2  D5  D1  Dimension 1 Cybersecurity Policy and Strategy explores the country’s capacity  to develop and deliver cybersecurity strategy, and to enhance its cybersecurity  resilience by improving its incident response, cyber defence and critical infrastructure  (CI) protection capacities. This Dimension considers effective strategy and policy  in delivering national cybersecurity capability, while maintaining the benefits of a  cyberspace vital for government, international business and society in general.  Dimension 2 Cybersecurity Culture and Society reviews important elements of a  responsible cybersecurity culture such as the understanding of cyber-related risks  in society, the level of trust in Internet services, e-government and e-commerce  services, and users’ understanding of personal information protection online.  Moreover, this Dimension explores the existence of reporting mechanisms  functioning as channels for users to report cybercrime. In addition, this Dimension  reviews the role of media and social media in shaping cybersecurity values,  attitudes and behaviour.  Dimension 3 Building Cybersecurity Knowledge and Capabilities reviews the  availability, quality and uptake of programmes for various groups of stakeholders,  including the government, private sector and the population as a whole, and relate  to cybersecurity awareness-raising programmes, formal cybersecurity educational  programmes, and professional training programmes.  Dimension 4 Legal and Regulatory Frameworks examines the government’s  capacity to design and enact national legislation that directly and indirectly  relates to cybersecurity, with a particular emphasis placed on the topics of  regulatory requirements for cybersecurity, cybercrime-related legislation and  related legislation. The capacity to enforce such laws is examined through law  enforcement, prosecution, regulatory bodies and court capacities. Moreover, this  Dimension observes issues such as formal and informal co-operation frameworks  to combat cybercrime.  Dimension 5 Standards and Technologies addresses effective and widespread  use of cybersecurity technology to protect individuals, organisations and national  infrastructure. This Dimension specifically examines the implementation of  cybersecurity standards and good practices, the deployment of processes and  controls, and the development of technologies and products in order to reduce  cybersecurity risks.  The CMM defines five Stages of maturity for all Dimensions being: start-up,  formative, established, strategic, and dynamic. These correspond to the following:  initial development of capacity, being established, being world-leading, and able to  anticipate and prepare for future cybersecurity needs.  It should be noted that there are relationships between the Dimensions; for example,  to be effective in one area of capacity often places requirements on other areas1. It  is also the case that resources are limited and priorities for capacity enhancements  are likely to require a response which could span multiple Dimensions. Therefore,  a benchmarking activity reviews a country against the entire CMM and across all  Dimensions, enabling an holistic consideration of national capacity.  1 For a country to reach an established level of maturity under the Aspect ‘Initiatives by Government’ in Factor 3.1 Building Cybersecurity Awareness, one of the requirements that must be met is that the content  of the co-ordinated national cybersecurity awareness-raising programme includes explicit links to national cybersecurity strategy. Similarly, for a country to reach an established level of maturity under the Aspect  ‘Administration’ in Factor 3.2 Cybersecurity Education, cybersecurity education priorities resulting from the multi-stakeholder consultation process should be reflected in the national cybersecurity strategy.

Each Dimension is constituted by a range of Factors, which capture the core  capacities required to deliver the Dimension. Together, they represent the different ‘lenses’  through which cybersecurity capacity can be evidenced and analysed.  Factor  Within the five Dimensions, Factors describe what it means to possess cybersecurity  capacity. These are the essential elements of national capacity, which are then measured for  maturity Stage. The complete list of Factors seeks to holistically incorporate all of a nation’s  cybersecurity capacity needs. Most Factors are composed of a number of Aspects which  structure the Factor’s Indicators into more concise parts (which directly relate to evidence  gathering and measurement). However, some Factors that are more limited in scope do not  have specific Aspects.  Aspect  Where a Factor possesses multiple components, these are Aspects. Aspects are an  organisational method to divide Indicators into smaller clusters that are easier to  comprehend. The number of Aspects depends on the themes that emerge in the content of  the Factor and the overall complexity of the Factor.  Stage  Stages define the degree to which a country has progressed in relation to a certain Factor or  Aspect of cybersecurity capacity. The CMM consists of five distinct Stages of maturity: start-up,  formative, established, strategic, dynamic (detailed on page 8). A CMM review will benchmark  a country against these Stages, capturing existing cybersecurity capacity, from which a country  can improve or decline depending on the actions taken (or inaction). Within each Stage there  are a number of Indicators which a country has to fulfil to successfully have reached the Stage.  Indicator  Indicators represent the most basic part of CMM’s structure. Each Indicator describes  the steps, actions, or building blocks that are indicative of a specific Stage of maturity. To  have successfully reached a Stage of maturity, a country will need to convince itself that it  can evidence each of the Indicators. In order to elevate a country’s cybersecurity capacity  maturity, all of the Indicators within a particular Stage will need to have been fulfilled. Most  of these Indicators are binary in nature, i.e., the country can either evidence it has fulfilled  the Indicator criteria, or it cannot provide such evidence.

A CMM review will benchmark a country against these Stages, capturing existing cybersecurity capacity.  Start-up  At this Stage, either no cybersecurity maturity exists, or it is very embryonic in nature. There might be initial discussions about  cybersecurity capacity building, but no concrete actions have been taken. There may be an absence of observable evidence at  this Stage;  Formative  Some features of the Aspect have begun to grow and be formulated, but may be ad hoc, disorganised, poorly defined or simply  new. However, evidence of this activity can be clearly demonstrated;  Established  The Indicators of the Aspect are in place, and evidence shows that they are working. There is not, however, well thought-out  consideration of the relative allocation of resources. Little trade-off decision-making has been made concerning the relative  investment in the various elements of the Aspect. But the Aspect is functional and defined;  Strategic  Choices have been made about which parts of the Aspect are important, and which are less important for the particular  organisation or nation. The strategic Stage reflects the fact that these choices have been made, conditional upon the nation or  organisation’s particular circumstances; and  Dynamic  At this Stage, there are clear mechanisms in place to alter national strategy depending on the prevailing circumstances, such  as the technology of the threat environment, global conflict, or a significant change in one area of concern (e.g. cybercrime  or privacy). There is also evidence of global leadership on cybersecurity issues. Key sectors, at least, have devised methods  for changing strategies at any stage during their development. Rapid decision-making, reallocation of resources, and constant  attention to the changing environment are feature of this Stage.  The CMM allows the benchmarking of current national cybersecurity capacity. Understanding the requirements to achieve  higher levels of capacity will directly indicate areas for further investment, and how to evidence such capacity levels. The CMM  can also be used to build business cases for investment and expected performance enhancements. Combining a CMM review  with national risk assessments, social, and economic strategies can further prioritise which capacity enhancements to make.

Advice may have been sought  from international partners.  Processes for strategy  development have been  initiated.  An outline/draft national  cybersecurity strategy has been  articulated.  Consultation processes have  been agreed for key stakeholder  groups, including private sector,  civil society and international  partners.  A national cybersecurity strategy  has been published.  An assessment of country-specific  national cybersecurity risk has been  conducted.  The strategy reflects the needs  and roles of relevant stakeholders  across government (national and  sub-national), business and civil  society.  An implementation programme is  in place which covers the scope of  the strategy.  Mechanisms are in place to enable  strategy ‘owners’ to monitor  achievement of outcomes, address  implementation issues and  maintain strategy alignment.  Strategy review and renewal  processes are in place.  Emerging cybersecurity risks  are regularly assessed and used  to update the strategy and  implementation plan.  The impact of the strategy  on risk and harm reduction is  understood and is used to inform  funding and priority decisions.  The national cybersecurity  strategy and implementation  plan are both proactively  reviewed to take account of  broader strategic developments  within the country (political,  economic, social, technical, legal  and environmental).  The country is an acknowledged  authority within the international  community and is supporting  the development of national and  global cybersecurity strategies.  Cybersecurity considerations are  embedded within other relevant  national-level strategies and  implementation programmes.  Content  Various national policies and  strategies may exist that refer  to cybersecurity, but these  are not comprehensive and  there is little evidence that  these reflect specific national  priorities and circumstances.  Content exists that reflects  country-specific priorities and  circumstances.  Links exist between the strategy  (or draft strategy) and priorities  such as national security,  digital strategy and economic  development, but these are  generally ad hoc and lack detail.  The strategy (or draft strategy)  defines the key outcomes against  which success can be evaluated.  The content of the national  cybersecurity strategy is based on  a comprehensive risk assessment  that includes explicit links to  wider national level economic and  political policies and strategies.  The content includes actions  to raise public and business  awareness, mitigate cybercrime,  establish incident response  capability, promote public-private  partnership and protect critical  infrastructure and the wider  economy.  Consideration has been given to  how the national cybersecurity  strategy might incorporate or  support wider online policy  objectives such as: child protection;  the promotion of Human Rights;  the promotion of Equality, Diversity  and Inclusion; and managing  disinformation.  The content takes account of the  impact on cybersecurity risk of  emerging technologies and their  use within critical infrastructure,  the wider economy and society.  The outcomes defined in  the strategy are specific and  measurable. Metrics have  been defined which enable  stakeholders to evaluate the  effectiveness of the strategy in  reducing harm.  Consideration has been given  to how the beneficial outcomes  of the strategy can be sustained  beyond the strategy’s lifetime,  including how the maintenance  of new capabilities will be  financed.  The content takes account of the  impact of broader developments  on cybersecurity risk (political,  economic, social, technical, legal  and environmental).  The content of the national  cybersecurity strategy promotes  and encourages bilateral and  multilateral co-operation  between countries to ensure  a secure, resilient and trusted  cyberspace.  12 Cybersecurity Capacity Maturity Model for Nations (CMM) - 2021 Edition  D3  D1  D4  D2  D5  D 1.1  D 1.2  D 1.3  D 1.4  Factor - D 1.1: National Cybersecurity Strategy Aspect Start-Up Formative Established Strategic Dynamic  Implementation  and Review  No overarching  national cybersecurity  implementation programme  has been developed.  A co-ordinated cybersecurity  implementation programme is  being developed with relevant  stakeholders involved, including  the private sector and civil  society.  Actions within the programme  have been assigned to specific  ‘owners’ but the availability of  adequate resources has not yet  been confirmed.  Mechanisms to review processes  are limited or ad hoc.  A detailed implementation plan has  been published including actions,  responsible entities and resource  budgets. The implementation plan  involves relevant stakeholders across  government and other sectors.  A co-ordinating body has been  assigned. The body has sufficient  authority to ensure that action  ‘owners’ are held to account.  The resources required to deliver the  actions of the programme have been  identified and are in place. Budget  shortfalls are identified and escalated  to the relevant authority.  Programme review processes and  metrics are in place that allow  progress to be measured and risks,  issues and dependencies to be  escalated to the relevant authority.  These processes are adequately  funded.  Outcome-oriented metrics are  being used to monitor the impact  that the programme is having on  risk reduction (and other relevant  strategy goals).  There is evidence of these  metrics being used to refine  action plans.  Metrics (both progress and  outcome-oriented metrics) are  drawn from a wide variety of  governmental, non-governmental  and international sources.  There is independent oversight  and/or assurance of the  programme.  Mechanisms are in place  to make more far-reaching  changes to the programme in  the event of significant changes  in circumstance (political,  economic, social, technical, legal  and environmental).  The programme contributes  to the global development of  outcome-oriented metrics and  their application.  International  Engagement  There is limited awareness  of the principal international  debates relating to  cybersecurity policy (such  as cybersecurity norms,  mutual legal assistance,  Internet Governance, data  sovereignty, data protection).  The country may benefit  from regional/ international  operational collaboration  networks but does not  actively engage.  The country is aware of the  existence of international  discussions on cybersecurity  policy and related issues.  The country may, on occasion,  participate in regional or  international discussions on  matters related to cybersecurity  issues, but does not generally  play an active role.  The country may participate  in relevant operational  collaboration and policy bodies  (such as FIRST*, regional CERT**  bodies, the IGF***, or the UN  GGE****), but takes mainly a  passive role.  An assessment has been made of  how the international debates on  cybersecurity policy and related  issues affect the country’s interests  and international standing. Specific  engagement objectives have been  defined accordingly. Multiple  stakeholders have been involved in  this process.  The country is actively participating  in relevant international bodies and  forums, either directly or through  relevant representative bodies.  Their voices are being heard and  are having an impact.  The country actively contributes to  regional/ international operational  collaboration and policy bodies.  The country is actively building  international communities  of interest around specific  cybersecurity policy goals and  promoting their adoption.  The country makes a major  contribution to regional/ international operational bodies  and is actively involved in  building capacity in third-party  countries.  The country is a leading actor  in building consensus, fostering  inclusivity and shaping the  international debates on key  cybersecurity policy issues.  The country is focused on the  future, seeing emerging issues  (around new technology or new  types of threat), and is initiating  new international debates  around the key issues.  The country is actively involved  in creating new regional/ international collaboration  mechanisms.  * Forum of Incident Response and Security Teams  ** Computer Emergency Response Team  *** Internet Governance Forum  **** The United Nations Group of Governmental Experts  13 Cybersecurity Capacity Maturity Model for Nations (CMM) - 2021 Edition  D3  D1  D4  D2  D5  D 1.1  D 1.2  D 1.3  D 1.4  Factor - D 1.2: Incident Response and Crisis Management Aspect Start-Up Formative Established Strategic Dynamic  Identification  and  Categorisation  of Incidents  No process for identifying and  categorising national-level  incidents exists.  Some organisations and sectors  have internal mechanisms for  identifying and categorising  incidents within their purview.  A process for identifying  national-level incidents is under  development.  There is no central registry in  place but ad-hoc arrangements  exist for dealing with the most  significant events.  Most major organisations  have internal mechanisms for  identifying and categorising  incidents.  A central registry of national- level cybersecurity incidents  exists and a process for timely  escalation of incidents, from the  organisational to the national  level, is in place.  Individual national incidents are  categorised according to severity  and resources are allocated  accordingly.  Insights arising from national  level incidents are routinely  analysed in order to establish  lessons and inform broader  cybersecurity policy and strategy.  The criteria for categorising  incidents are sufficiently flexible  to cater for rapidly emerging  changes in the underlying  technological or threat  environment.  The country is contributing  to international best practice  in incident identification and  categorisation.  Organisation  No organisation for national-level  cyber incident response exists.  A few organisations may have  internal cybersecurity response  mechanisms in place but co- ordination is minimal.  A national CERT* might exist but  lacks sufficient resources and  skills.  Processes for managing incidents  are still in development.  Some organisations from  public and private sectors have  internal cybersecurity response  mechanisms in place but co- ordination with the national  CERT is ad hoc.  The role of sub-national bodies  is unclear.  Bilateral co-operation with  international partners is limited  or ad hoc.  A national body for incident  response has been established.  It has the resources, skills,  documented processes and legal  authorities required to address  the range of cyber incident  scenarios that the country is likely  to face (including out-of-hours  capability, if appropriate).  Relationships and protocols  are in place to enable incident  management co-ordination  between the national body and  other elements of the public and  private sectors.  The role of sub-national bodies  in incident response is clear  and mechanisms are in place to  enable co-ordination between the  national and sub-national levels.  There is regular sharing of threat  and vulnerability information,  and operational good practices  between the national body and a  wide range of public and private  sector organisations, as well as  international partners.  The national body undertakes  a wide range of engagement  activities such as convening  communities of interest, running  cross-sector exercises and  promoting best cybersecurity  practices.  The national body innovates to  provide a range of additional  services that improve the  country’s ability to prevent,  detect, respond and recover  from threats.  The national body is widely  recognised as an authoritative  voice on cybersecurity within the  country.  The effectiveness of the national  body in reducing cyber risk and  harm is regularly evaluated  and benchmarked against  international good practice.  The government’s overall  operational response is  adaptive to changes in the  underlying technical and threat  environment.  The country is contributing to  international best practice on  how to organise operational  responses to cybersecurity  threats.  * Computer Emergency Response Team  14 Cybersecurity Capacity Maturity Model for Nations (CMM) - 2021 Edition  D3  D1  D4  D2  D5  D 1.1  D 1.2  D 1.3  D 1.4  Factor - D 1.2: Incident Response and Crisis Management Aspect Start-Up Formative Established Strategic Dynamic  Integration of  Cybersecurity  into National  Crisis  Management  No framework exists for national- level crisis management.  Cybersecurity has not been  considered as a potential  national-level crisis scenario.  Emergency communication  capabilities are limited.  A national crisis management  framework is in development  and a specific organisation has  been allocated responsibility  for leading national-level crisis  response.  Cybersecurity has been  recognised as relevant to  national crisis management,  both as a factor in its own right  and as an element of other crisis  scenarios.  An exercise programme is in  development and includes  cybersecurity-based scenarios.  Emergency communication  capabilities are in place but may  not be well integrated or lack  resilience to cyber disruption.  Cybersecurity is fully integrated  into the national crisis  management framework and the  organisation responsible for crisis  management is equipped to deal  with a range of cybersecurity- related scenarios.  The role of a cyber incident  management authority within  the crisis management process is  well defined and established, and  escalation thresholds are fully  understood.  National crisis management  scenarios with cybersecurity  components are regularly  exercised.  Emergency communication  systems are regularly tested  for cyber resilience against a  range of cybersecurity-related  scenarios.  Lessons learnt from cyber crisis  exercises are used to inform  both national crisis management  policy and the national  cybersecurity strategy and  implementation plan.  International crisis planning  and exercising with partners  exists and routinely includes  cybersecurity as an element.  The resilience of emergency  communications has been stress- tested against a wide range of  potential scenarios.  The country is contributing to  the debate on the integration  of cyber into national and  international crisis management.  Emergency communications  capabilities are capable of  operating beyond the country’s  border in order to support third- party countries and global crisis  responses.  15 Cybersecurity Capacity Maturity Model for Nations (CMM) - 2021 Edition  D3  D1  D4  D2  D5  D 1.1  D 1.2  D 1.3  D 1.4  Factor - D 1.3: Critical Infrastructure (CI) Protection Aspect Start-Up Formative Established Strategic Dynamic  Identification  There may be some  appreciation of what  constitutes a CI asset, but no  formal categorisation of CI  assets has been produced.  A list of general CI assets, sectors  and operators has been created.  The list of CI assets has been  formalised and incorporates a range of  appropriate public and private sector  organisations.  Specific operators have been identified  and are aware of their status.  The list is kept up to date to  reflect changes in the country’s  circumstances.  Cross-border dependencies have been  identified.  The list of CI assets is adaptive to  strategic shifts in the underlying  technical, social and economic  environment.  Interdependencies between  sectors are managed.  Cross-border dependencies are  managed.  There is flexibility in the process  for identifying CI assets to cater  for rapidly emerging changes in  the underlying technological or  threat environment.  The country is actively involved  in the identification and  prioritisation of global CI assets.  Cross-sector and cross-border  dependencies are mitigated.  Regulatory  Requirements  There are no existing  regulatory requirements  specific to the cybersecurity  of CI.  The need for baseline  standards to govern CI assets is  acknowledged but these are not  explicitly mandated in regulation.  Sector regulators do not  routinely assess CI operators for  compliance.  CI operators are mandated by  regulation to meet appropriate  cybersecurity standards (either in  the form of specific cyber regulation  or as part of broader regulatory  requirements).  Mandatory breach reporting and  vulnerability disclosure requirements  are in place.  Formal processes are in place to  evaluate CI operator compliance with  regulatory standards and incident and  vulnerability disclosure.  Novel approaches to regulatory  supervision are being developed  to improve CI cybersecurity while  also facilitating effective and  efficient CI service delivery.  The country is promoting best  practice regulatory approaches at  an international level.  Regulatory frameworks are  sufficiently flexible to cater for  rapidly emerging changes in  the underlying technological or  threat environment.  The country is actively involved  in establishing regulatory  approaches to assuring global CI.  Operational  Practice  A few CI operators may  be implementing good  cybersecurity practices, but  this is inconsistent.  Many CI operators are  implementing good cybersecurity  practice.  There is some self-assessment  against recognised industry  standards.  Some informal arrangements  exist for collaboration across and  within sectors.  CI operators are consistently  implementing recognised industry  standards and the effectiveness  of their cybersecurity controls are  regularly assessed.  Mechanisms are in place for operators  to share threat and vulnerability  information, best practices and lessons  learned from incidents and near  misses.  CI operators participate fully in  national incident response and crisis  management planning and exercising.  Mechanisms are in place for public  authorities to provide information and  other practical support to CI operators,  both pre- and post- incident.  There is extensive collaboration  among CI operators and with  public authorities to develop  strategies that enhance collective  cybersecurity.  The resilience of the critical  infrastructure ecosystem as  a whole has been assessed  against a range of scenarios, and  measures are in place to address  systemic risks to the economy  and society.  The country and its CI operators  are contributing to the  international debate on global  critical infrastructure resilience.  Experts from the regulators  and CI operators are recognised  internationally for their  contribution to addressing  global infrastructure protection  challenges.  16 Cybersecurity Capacity Maturity Model for Nations (CMM) - 2021 Edition  D3  D1  D4  D2  D5  D 1.1  D 1.2  D 1.3  D 1.4  Factor - D 1.4: Cybersecurity in Defence and National Security Aspect Start-Up Formative Established Strategic Dynamic  Defence Force  Cybersecurity  Strategy  The potential impact of  cybersecurity on national  security and defence may have  been considered but has not  been formally articulated.  The potential impact of  cybersecurity on national  security and defence has been  assessed and a strategy for  addressing these risks is under  development.  This analysis includes risks to the  ability of the country’s military  and other national security  assets to operate in a contested  cyber environment.  A strategy for cybersecurity for  national security and defence  has been formally adopted  (stand-alone or as part of a wider  document).  The strategy is supported by  appropriate legal authorities and  relevant operational doctrine  and rules of engagement. These  are consistent with international  humanitarian law.  The dependence of national  security and military entities on  the cybersecurity of other parts of  the critical national infrastructure  is understood and is addressed  in the defence cybersecurity  strategy.  Cybersecurity considerations  inform other elements of national  security and defence strategy,  where relevant.  Defence strategy includes  appropriate considerations of  deterrence.  The country’s defence and  national security establishment  (alongside other stakeholders)  is actively engaged in the  global debate on international  humanitarian law and norms  of behaviour as they relate  to conflict in cyberspace.  Declaratory strategy and  published doctrine may be part  of this.  Strategy and doctrine are  not static but are adaptive to  changing capabilities and to the  geo-political and technical threat  environment.  The strategy is designed to  promote stability in cyberspace.  This includes measures to predict  and influence the strategies and  actions and reactions of potential  allies and adversaries.  Defence Force  Cybersecurity  Capability  Specialist cybersecurity capability  within the national security  establishment is limited.  Specialist cybersecurity capability  requirements are understood,  and relevant organisational  structures have been defined.  Initial steps have been taken to  establish these.  Capabilities and organisational  structures are in place and  have been tested. Resourcing is  provided through the national  military estimate or equivalent  process.  Operational doctrine and rules of  engagement are fully embedded  in training.  Specialist intelligence resources  are being applied to provide  support and are appropriately  resourced.  Mechanisms to facilitate  collaboration with allies are in  place and have been tested.  Relevant deterrence and  defence/resilience capabilities  are in place, forming part of the  country’s defence cybersecurity  strategy.  Cybersecurity is embedded in  wider operational and command  training within the country’s  military forces.  Defence cybersecurity  capabilities are able to support  multilateral responses to shared  national security challenges.  17 Cybersecurity Capacity Maturity Model for Nations (CMM) - 2021 Edition  D3  D1  D4  D2  D5  D 1.1  D 1.2  D 1.3  D 1.4  Factor - D 1.4: Cybersecurity in Defence and National Security Aspect Start-Up Formative Established Strategic Dynamic  Civil Defence  Co-ordination  Collaboration on cybersecurity  between civil and defence  entities is limited.  Informal collaboration on  cybersecurity between civil  and defence entities may exist  but has not been formalised.  Defence entities have not been  formally resourced to undertake  this work.  Collaboration on cybersecurity  between civil and defence entities  exists and has been formalised.  Respective roles have been  defined within the country’s crisis  management procedures.  The resources required within  the defence and national security  community, to support civil and  CI authorities, have been formally  assessed and assigned.  Formal mechanisms are in  place to determine military/ national security cybersecurity  dependencies on civil and CI  infrastructure. The ability of civil  and CI infrastructure operators to  provide these services has been  assured.  Civil defence collaboration on  cybersecurity is built into the  strategic planning of both sectors  and designed to address a range  of future crisis scenarios.  Mechanisms are in place that  enable defence and the national  security community to draw on  the skills and capabilities of the  broader economy and society.  (For example, via a formal cyber  reserve force)  The country is leading the  international debate on best  practice in cross-governmental,  civil-defence cybersecurity  collaboration.  18 Cybersecurity Capacity Maturity Model for Nations (CMM) - 2021 Edition  D3  D1  D4  D2  D5  D 2.1  D 2.2  D 2.3  D 2.4  D 2.5  Dimension 2: Cybersecurity  Culture and Society This Dimension reviews important elements of a responsible  cybersecurity culture such as the understanding of cyber- related risks in society, the level of trust in Internet services,  e-government and e-commerce services, and users’  understanding of personal information protection online.

Civil society and other non- government actors lack the  tools and resources to address  online disinformation, such  as exposing misinformation  campaigns.  Government agencies and  actors have not addressed  online disinformation online.  Internet platform providers  are developing approaches to  address issues of disinformation  in this nation.  The development of tools  and resources to address  disinformation have been  initiated by leading civil society  and non-governmental actors.  Government programmes  and initiatives to address  disinformation are being  developed but entail filtering and  limited efforts to inform Internet  users.  Internet platform providers have  a number of approaches in place  to address disinformation; these  respect freedom of expression and  other human rights online.  Civil society stakeholders have  developed tools and resources to  address online disinformation.  Government programmes and  initiatives to strengthen the  public’s preparedness against  online disinformation are  restricted to awareness raising,  but avoid censorship or filtering of  information.  Internet platform providers have  instituted policies and practices  to address disinformation; these  respect freedom of expression  and other human rights online.  The joint efforts of civil society  stakeholders are in place and are  regularly used to address online  disinformation in ways that  respect freedom of expression  and other human rights online.  Outcome-oriented surveys are  used to refine programmes and  initiatives aimed at empowering  users and building the public’s  understanding of possible online  disinformation.  Internet platform providers have  instituted policies and practices  to address disinformation in  some innovative ways that  respect freedom of expression  and other human rights online.  The joint efforts of civil society  stakeholders are proactively  reviewed to take account of  broader strategic developments  related to disinformation and  awareness raising.  The country is supporting the  development of national/ regional/ international action  plans and guidelines to address  disinformation in ways that  protect an open Internet and  empower users.  User Trust in  E-government  Services  Government offers a very  limited number of e-services,  if any, and has not publicly  promoted their security.  Generally, the public does  not use any significant  e-government services.  No surveys or metrics exist to  show how Internet users trust  e-government services.  There is a lack of information  about e-government security  and security breaches.  Government has begun to build  a core set of e-services, for which  they recognise the need to apply  security measures in order to  establish trust in their use.  A limited number of early  adopters trust in the secure use  of e-government services.  Metrics to assess users’ trust in  e-government services is limited  or ad hoc.  Public authorities are developing  information on privacy and  security initiatives and breaches  in an ad-hoc manner.  Key e-government services  have been developed and have  generated a large number of  users.  A sizeable and growing number  of Internet users trust in the use  of e-government services.  Surveys and metrics to assess  users’ trust in e-government  services are in place and  adequately funded.  Public authorities are publishing  information and updates of their  privacy and security breaches  and initiatives such as privacy by  default.  E-government services have  become the dominant (default)  mode of government information  service delivery.  The majority of Internet users in  this country trust in the secure  use of e-government services  and make use of them.  Surveys and metrics to assess  users’ trust in e-government  services are routinely conducted.  Public authorities are co- ordinating, publishing and  informing users about privacy  and security initiatives and  breaches.  E-government services in this  country are recognised regionally  or internationally.  Internet users trust that  e-government services are  proactively reviewed, improved  and expanded to enhance their  security.  Outcome-oriented surveys are  used to review e-government  services and evaluate the  management of online content.  The country is a leader in  informing users about current  and developing privacy and  security breaches, initiatives and  other issues.  24 Cybersecurity Capacity Maturity Model for Nations (CMM) - 2021 Edition  D3  D1  D4  D2  D5  D 2.1  D 2.2  D 2.3  D 2.4  D 2.5  Factor - D 2.2: Trust and Confidence in Online Services Aspect Start-Up Formative Established Strategic Dynamic  User Trust in  E-commerce  Services  E-commerce services are not  offered.

There is no or limited discussion  regarding the protection of  personal information online.  Privacy standards are not in place  to shape Internet and social  media practices.  Users and stakeholders within  the public and private sectors  may have general knowledge  about how personal information  is handled online; and may  employ good (proactive)  cybersecurity practices to protect  their personal information  online.  Discussions have begun  regarding the protection of  personal information and about  the balance between security  and privacy.  Concrete actions or privacy  policies are being developed.  A growing proportion of users  have the skills to manage their  privacy online, and protect  themselves from intrusion,  interference, or unwanted access  of information by others.  There is considerable public  debate regarding the protection  of personal information and  about the balance between  security and privacy.  Privacy policies have been  developed within the public and  private sectors.  All stakeholders have the  information, confidence and the  ability to take steps to protect  their personal information online  and to maintain control of the  distribution of this information.  Users and stakeholders within  the public and private sectors  widely recognise the importance  of protection of personal  information online and are aware  of their privacy rights.  Mechanisms are in place in  private and public sectors to  shape Internet and social media  practices and ensure that privacy  and security do not compete.  Users have the knowledge and  skills necessary to protect their  personal information online,  adapting their abilities to the  changing risk environment.  Policies in private and public  sectors are proactively reviewed  to ensure privacy and security  do not compete in a changing  environment and are informed  by user feedback and public  debate.  New mechanisms are in place,  such as privacy by default, as  tools for transparency and are  promoted.  26 Cybersecurity Capacity Maturity Model for Nations (CMM) - 2021 Edition  D3  D1  D4  D2  D5  D 2.1  D 2.2  D 2.3  D 2.4  D 2.5  Factor - D 2.4: Reporting Mechanisms Aspect Start-Up Formative Established Strategic Dynamic  Reporting  Mechanisms  There are no official reporting  mechanisms available, but  discussions might have begun.  Users do not use social media  channels to raise concerns over  any cyber harms and problems.  No metrics of reported incidents  exist.  The public and/or private sectors  are providing some channels  for reporting cyber harms (such  as online fraud, cyber-bullying,  child abuse online, identity theft,  privacy and security breaches,  and other incidents), but these  channels are not co-ordinated  and are used in an ad-hoc  manner.  Internet users use social media  channels to inform other users in  an ad-hoc manner.  Metrics of reported incidents is  being developed.  Reporting mechanisms have been  established, promoted and are  regularly used.  Internet users widely use social  media channels to inform other  users.  There are good metrics of  reported incidents.  Co-ordinated reporting  mechanisms are widely used  and promoted within public and  private sectors.  Internet users routinely use  social media channels to inform  other users.  Cyber harm metrics have been  used to inform the revision and  promotion of new policies and  practices.  Mechanisms have been  developed to co-ordinate  response to reported incidents  between law enforcement and  the national incident response  capability.  Internet users habitually use  social media channels to inform  other users and share good  practice.  Metrics are routinely used to  inform policy and decision- makers.  27 Cybersecurity Capacity Maturity Model for Nations (CMM) - 2021 Edition  D3  D1  D4  D2  D5  D 2.1  D 2.2  D 2.3  D 2.4  D 2.5  Factor - D 2.5: Media and Online Platforms  Aspect Start-Up Formative Established Strategic Dynamic  Media and  Social Media  Mass media rarely, if ever, cover  information about cybersecurity  or report on issues such as  security breaches or cybercrime.  There is no, or rarely any  discussion on social media about  cybersecurity.  Any portrayal of whistleblowers  is negative, and based on  criminal or other negative  stereotypes.  It is perceived that there is  ad-hoc mass media coverage  of cybersecurity, with limited  information provided and  reporting on specific issues that  individuals face online, such as  protection for children online, or  cyber-bullying.  It is perceived that there is  limited discussion on social  media about cybersecurity.  There have been positive  examples of cases where  whistleblowers have had a  constructive impact.  It is perceived that cybersecurity  is a common subject across  mainstream media, and  information and reports on a wide  range of issues, including security  breaches and cybercrime, are  widely disseminated.  There is broad discussion on social  media about cybersecurity.  There is acceptance that  whistleblowers can play a positive  role.  It is perceived that mass media  coverage extends beyond  threat reporting and can inform  the public about proactive  and actionable cybersecurity  measures, as well economic and  social impacts.  There is frequent discussion on  social media about cybersecurity  and individuals regularly use  social media to share online  experiences.  Transparency is encouraged as  are whistleblowers.  It is perceived that the  broad discussion of personal  experiences and personal  attitudes of individuals across  mainstream and social media  inform policy making and  facilitate societal change.  Social media has become a  major component in tracking and  addressing cyber harms.  Whistleblowing has been  encouraged and protected as a  means of social accountability.  28 Cybersecurity Capacity Maturity Model for Nations (CMM) - 2021 Edition  D3  D1  D4  D2  D5  D 3.1  D 3.2  D 3.3  D 3.4  Dimension 3: Building Cybersecurity  Knowledge and Capabilities This Dimension reviews the availability, quality and uptake of  programmes for various groups of stakeholders, including the  government, private sector and the population as a whole,  and relate to cybersecurity awareness-raising programmes,  formal cybersecurity educational programmes, and professional  training programmes.

The need for awareness of  cybersecurity threats and  vulnerabilities in the government  is not recognised or is only at  initial stages of discussion.  A co-ordinated cybersecurity  awareness raising programme  with the involvement of  the government is under  development, with relevant  stakeholders involved, including  the private sector and civil society.  Awareness-raising programmes,  courses, seminars and online  resources initiated by the  government are available but  not sufficiently reflected in the  national cybersecurity strategy or  is in development.  The actions within the  programmes are led by different  ‘owners’ but they are not yet co- ordinated.  The availability of adequate  resources has not yet been  confirmed.  Initial system of mechanisms and  metrics to review processes are  limited or ad hoc.  A co-ordinated national  cybersecurity awareness- raising programme with  detailed implementation plan  is published. The content  includes explicit links to national  cybersecurity strategy.  A co-ordinating body has been  assigned with sufficient authority  and resources required to deliver  the actions of the national  programme.  A national cybersecurity  awareness portal exists  to improve the skills and  knowledge of the society  and is disseminated via that  programme.  Programme review processes  and outcome-oriented metrics  are in place, are adequately  funded and allow effectiveness  to be measured.  The national awareness-raising  programme is fully integrated  with sector-specific, tailored  awareness-raising programmes,  such as those focusing on  industry, academia, civil society,  and/or women and children.  Emerging cybersecurity risks  are regularly assessed and  used to update the national  cybersecurity awareness-raising  programme.  There is evidence of these  metrics being used to refine  actions within the national  awareness-raising programme  and national cybersecurity  strategy.  The national cybersecurity  awareness-raising programme  with private and civil society  stakeholders is proactively  reviewed to take account of  broader strategic developments  within the country (political,  economic, social, technical, legal  and environmental).  The country is actively involved  in creating new regional/ international cybersecurity  awareness-raising programmes  that contribute toward  expanding and enhancing  international awareness-raising  good practices.  The national cybersecurity  awareness-raising programme  has a measurable impact on the  reduction of the overall threat  landscape.  Initiatives by  Private Sector  The need for awareness of  cybersecurity threats and  vulnerabilities in the private  sector is not recognised or is only  at initial stages of discussion.  Awareness-raising programmes,  courses, seminars and online  resources initiated by the private  sector are available but no co- ordination or scaling efforts have  been conducted.  Initial system of mechanisms and  metrics to review processes are  limited or ad hoc.  Collaborative awareness-raising  efforts (e.g.: joint policy and/or  advocacy work) with government  and civil society stakeholders  are made in order to pool  resources, information and  identify solutions for cyber safety  practices.  The role of specific ‘owners’  assigned to actions within private  sector initiatives are clear and  mechanisms are in place to  enable co-ordination between  the levels of government, private  sector and civil society.  Programme review processes  and outcome-oriented metrics  are in place, well-funded and  shared with government and civil  society stakeholders.  The effectiveness of joint  awareness-raising efforts with  government and civil society  stakeholders is regularly  assessed and used to enhance  collaborative processes.  Private sector initiatives are  fully integrated into the national  awareness-raising programme.  Evidence from the lessons learnt  is fed into the development of  future programmes.  The joint awareness-raising  efforts with government and  civil society stakeholders are  proactively reviewed to take  account of broader strategic  developments within the  country (political, economic,  social, technical, legal and  environmental).  The joint awareness-raising  efforts with government and  civil society stakeholders have a  measurable impact on reduction  of the overall threat landscape.  32 Cybersecurity Capacity Maturity Model for Nations (CMM) - 2021 Edition  D3  D1  D4  D2  D5  D 3.1  D 3.2  D 3.3  D 3.4  Factor - D 3.1: Building Cybersecurity Awareness  Aspect Start-Up Formative Established Strategic Dynamic  Initiatives by  Civil Society  The need for awareness of  cybersecurity threats and  vulnerabilities in civil society is  not recognised or is only at initial  stages of discussion.  There are indications that civil  society realises that it can play  a role in awareness-raising  programmes, courses, seminars  and online resources, but no real  deliverables are yet evident.  Initial system of metrics may  exist.  Collaborative awareness-raising  efforts (e.g.: joint policy and/or  advocacy work) with government  and private sector stakeholders  are taking place in order to pool  resources and information and  identify solutions for cyber safety  practices.  The role of specific ‘owners’  assigned to actions within civil  society initiatives are clear and  mechanisms are in place to  enable co-ordination between  the levels of government, private  sector and civil society.  Programme review processes  and outcome-oriented metrics  are in place, well-funded and  shared with government and  private sector stakeholders.  The effectiveness of joint  awareness-raising efforts  with government and private  sector stakeholders is regularly  assessed and used to enhance  collaborative processes.

The joint awareness-raising  efforts with government and  private sector stakeholders are  proactively reviewed to take  account of broader strategic  developments within the  country (political, economic,  social, technical, legal and  environmental).  The joint awareness-raising  efforts with government and  private sector have a measurable  impact on reduction of the  overall threat landscape.  Executive  Awareness  Raising  Awareness raising on  cybersecurity issues for  executives is limited or non- existent.  Executives are not yet aware  of their responsibilities to  shareholders, clients, customers,  and employees in relation to  cybersecurity.  Executives are made aware of  general cybersecurity issues, but  not how these issues and threats  might affect their organisations.  Executives of particular  sectors, such as finance and  telecommunications, have been  made aware of cybersecurity  risks in general, and how  the organisation deals with  cybersecurity issues, but not of  strategic implications.  Awareness raising of executives  in the public, private, academic  and civil society sectors address  cybersecurity risks in general,  some of the primary methods of  attack, and how the organisation  deals with cyber issues (usually  abdicated to the CIO*).  Select executive members  are made aware of how  cybersecurity risks affect the  strategic decision making of  the organisation, particularly  those in the financial and  telecommunications sectors.  Awareness-raising efforts of  cybersecurity crisis management  at the executive level is still  reactive in focus.  Executive awareness-raising  efforts in nearly all sectors  include the identification  of strategic assets, specific  measures in place to protect  them, and the mechanism by  which they are protected.  Executives are able to alter  strategic decision making and  allocate specific funding and  people to the various elements  of cyber risk, contingent on their  company’s prevailing situation.  Executives are made aware of  what contingency plans are  in place to address various  cyber-based attacks and their  aftermath.  Executive awareness courses in  cybersecurity are mandatory for  nearly all sectors.  Cybersecurity risks are  considered as an agenda item  at every executive meeting,  and funding and attention is  reallocated to address those  risks.  Executives at regional and  international level are regarded  as a source of good practice in  responsible and accountable  corporate cybersecurity  governance.  * Chief Information Officer  33 Cybersecurity Capacity Maturity Model for Nations (CMM) - 2021 Edition  D3  D1  D4  D2  D5  D 3.1  D 3.2  D 3.3  D 3.4  Factor - D 3.2: Cybersecurity Education Aspect Start-Up Formative Established Strategic Dynamic  Provision  Few or no cybersecurity  educators are available, and  there are no qualification  programmes for educators.  Computer science courses  are offered that may have a  security component, but no  cybersecurity-related courses are  offered.  No accreditation in cybersecurity  education exists.  Qualification programmes for  cybersecurity educators are  being explored, with a small  cadre of existing qualified  educators.  Some educational courses exist in  cybersecurity-related fields, such  as information security, network  security and cryptography, but  cybersecurity-specific courses are  not yet offered.  A demand for cybersecurity  education is evidenced through  course enrolment and feedback.  Qualifications for and supply of  educators are readily available in  cybersecurity.  Specialised courses in  cybersecurity are offered and  accredited at university level.  Cybersecurity risk-awareness  modules are offered as part of  many university courses.  Degrees in cybersecurity-related  fields are offered by universities  or equivalent educational  institutions.  Universities and other bodies  hold seminars/lectures on  cybersecurity issues, aimed at  non-specialists.  Research and development  are leading considerations in  cybersecurity education.  Cybersecurity education is  not limited to universities  or equivalent educational  institutions, but ranges from  primary, secondary and tertiary  to post-graduate levels, including  vocational education.  Steps might have been taken  to incorporate STEM* or  equivalent education framework  with a focus on cybersecurity  throughout primary and  secondary curricula.  Cybersecurity educators are not  only drawn from the academic  environment, but incentives are  in place so that industry and/or  government experts take these  positions as well.  Accredited cybersecurity courses  are embedded in all computer  science degrees.  Degrees are specifically offered  in cybersecurity, and encompass  courses and models in various  other cybersecurity-related  fields, including technical and  non-technical elements such as  policy implications, and multi- disciplinary education.  Cybersecurity educational  offerings are weighted and  focused on an understanding  of current risks and skills  requirements. The content of  cybersecurity courses covers  topics on emerging threats in  cybersecurity.  National or international  cybersecurity frameworks and/ or curricular guidelines are taken  into consideration by academic  institutions when designing  cybersecurity courses.  Apprenticeship programmes in  different industry sectors are  offered to combine knowledge  and practical skills.  National courses, degrees, and  research are at the forefront of  cybersecurity education.  Cybersecurity education  programmes maintain a balance  between preserving core  components of the curriculum  and promoting adaptive  processes that respond to rapid  changes in the cybersecurity  environment.  Prevailing cybersecurity  requirements are considered in  the redevelopment of all general  curricula.  * Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics  34 Cybersecurity Capacity Maturity Model for Nations (CMM) - 2021 Edition  D3  D1  D4  D2  D5  D 3.1  D 3.2  D 3.3  D 3.4  Factor - D 3.2: Cybersecurity Education Aspect Start-Up Formative Established Strategic Dynamic  Administration  The need to enhance national  cybersecurity education is not  yet considered.  A network of national contact  points for governmental,  regulatory bodies, critical  industries and education  institutions is not yet established.  Discussion of how co-ordinated  management of cybersecurity  education and research enhances  national knowledge development  has not or has only just begun.  The need to enhance  cybersecurity education  in schools and universities  or equivalent educational  institutions has been identified  by leading government, industry,  and academic stakeholders.  Schools, government and  industry collaborate in an  ad-hoc manner to supply the  resources necessary for providing  cybersecurity education.  A national budget focused on  cybersecurity education is not  yet established.  Initial system of mechanisms  and metrics to review the supply  and demand for cybersecurity  courses are limited or ad hoc.  Broad consultation across  government, private sector,  academia and civil society  stakeholders informs  cybersecurity education priorities  and is reflected in national  cybersecurity strategy.  National budget is dedicated to  national cybersecurity research  and laboratories at universities  or equivalent educational  institutions.  Competitions, initiatives and  funding schemes for students  and employees are promoted  by government and/or industry  in order to increase the  attractiveness of cybersecurity  careers.  Programme review processes  and outcome-oriented metrics to  review the supply and demand  for cybersecurity courses are in  place and well-funded.  Metrics are being used to refine  actions within educational  investment to create a cadre  of cybersecurity experts in the  country across, all sectors.  Management of the government  budget and spending on  cybersecurity education is based  on national demand.  Leading national cybersecurity  academic institutions share  lessons learnt with other national  and international counterparts.  Government has established  academic centres of excellence in  cybersecurity.  International cybersecurity  centres of excellence are  established through twinning  programmes led by world-class  institutions.  Co-operation between all  stakeholders in cybersecurity  education is routine and can be  proven.  Content in cybersecurity  education programmes is aligned  with practical cybersecurity  problems and business  challenges and provides a  mechanism for enhancing  curricula based on the evolving  landscape.  35 Cybersecurity Capacity Maturity Model for Nations (CMM) - 2021 Edition  D3  D1  D4  D2  D5  D 3.1  D 3.2  D 3.3  D 3.4  Factor - D 3.3: Cybersecurity Professional Training Aspect Start-Up Formative Established Strategic Dynamic  Provision  Few or no training  programmes in cybersecurity  exist.  The need for training  professionals in cybersecurity has  been documented at the national  level.  Training for general IT staff is  provided on cybersecurity issues  so that they can react to incidents  as they occur, but no training for  dedicated security professionals  exists.  ICT* professional certification  is offered, with some security  modules or components.  Best practice training and  certifications might be accessible  via international online sources  (e.g.: CISSP**).  Ad-hoc training courses, seminars  and online resources are available  for cybersecurity professionals  through public or private sources,  with limited evidence of take-up.  Structured cybersecurity training  programmes exist to develop skills  towards building a cadre of cybersecurity- specific professionals.  National or international cybersecurity  vocational-based frameworks and  international best practices are taken  into consideration when designing  professional training courses.  Security professional certification is  offered across sectors within the country.  The needs of society are well understood,  and a list of training requirements is  documented.  Training programmes for non- cybersecurity professionals are recognised  and offered.  Government initiatives to stay in the  country after the successful completion of  cybersecurity training programmes might  be in place.  A range of cybersecurity training  courses is tailored towards  meeting national strategic  demand and aligns with  international good practice.  The training programmes outline  the priorities in the national  cybersecurity strategy.  Training programmes are offered  to cybersecurity professionals  and focus on the skills necessary  to communicate technically  complex challenges to non- technical audiences, such as  management and general  employees.  Outcome-oriented metrics drawn  from comprehensive supply-and- demand data for cybersecurity  professionals are being used to  inform the modes, sustainability  and procedures of future training  programmes.  The public and private sector  collaborate to offer training,  and constantly adapt and seek  to build skillsets drawn from  both sectors.  Training offerings and  education programmes are  co-ordinated so that the  foundation established in  schools can enable training  programmes to build a highly  skilled workforce.  Programmes and incentive  structures are in place to  ensure the retention of the  trained workforce within the  country.  Uptake  Training uptake by IT  personnel designated to  respond to cybersecurity  incidents is limited or non- existent.  There is no transfer of  knowledge from employees  trained in cybersecurity to  untrained employees.  Metrics that evaluate the take- up of ad-hoc training courses,  seminars, online resources,  and certification offerings are  limited in scope or ad hoc.  The transfer of knowledge  from employees trained in  cybersecurity to untrained  employees in both the public and  private sectors is ad hoc.  There is an established cadre of certified  employees trained in cybersecurity  issues, processes, planning and analytics.  A national register of successful and  certified students and professionals might  exist.  The transfer of knowledge from  employees trained in cybersecurity to  untrained employees in both public and  private sectors is established.  Job creation initiatives for cybersecurity  within organisations are established and  encourage employers to train staff to  become cybersecurity professionals.  Programme review processes and  metrics are in place to allow progress to  be measured and assess the supply and  demand for cybersecurity-skilled workers  in both public and private environments.  These processes are adequately funded.  The uptake of cybersecurity  training is used to inform future  training programmes.  Co-ordination of training across  all sectors ensures the national  demand for professionals is met.  Cybersecurity professionals  not only fulfil national  requirements, but domestic  professionals overseas are  consulted to share lessons  learnt and best practice.  * Information and Communications Technology  ** Certified Information Systems Security Professional  36 Cybersecurity Capacity Maturity Model for Nations (CMM) - 2021 Edition  D3  D1  D4  D2  D5  D 3.1  D 3.2  D 3.3  D 3.4  Factor - D 3.4: Cybersecurity Research and Innovation Aspect Start-Up Formative Established Strategic Dynamic  Research and  Development  There are limited or no  cybersecurity research and  development (R&D) activities  occurring in the country.

General criminal law may exist,  but its application to cybercrime  is unclear.  Partial legislation exists that  addresses some aspects of  cybercrime, or cybercrime legal  provisions are in development.  Substantive cybercrime legal  provisions are contained in specific  legislation or a general criminal  law.  The country may have ratified  regional or international  instruments on cybercrime. The  country consistently seeks to  implement these measures into  domestic law.  Measures are in place to exceed  minimal baselines specified in  international treaties, where  appropriate.  The country seeks to adapt  its substantive cybercrime  legislation to take account of  emerging technologies and their  use.  Substantive cybercrime law  is constructed so that it can  cater for dynamic changes in  the underlying technology and  threat environment, without the  need for substantial and lengthy  revision.  The country is actively  contributing to the international  promotion of effective  cybercrime legislation.  Legal and  Regulatory  Requirements  for  Cybersecurity  There are limited cybersecurity  requirements set out in  regulation or law.  The need to create legal and  regulatory frameworks on  cybersecurity may have been  recognised and may have  resulted in a gap analysis.  Stakeholders from relevant  sectors have been consulted to  support the establishment of  legal and regulatory frameworks.  Draft legislation and regulation  may be in place, but this has yet  to be adopted and may not cover  all relevant sectors.  Comprehensive cybersecurity  requirements are set out in  relevant regulation and law  (including sector-specific  requirements, where relevant).  These requirements may include  mandatory standards, or breach  notification requirements  and vulnerability disclosure  requirements.  Relevant civil and criminal  liabilities are clearly articulated  and understood by regulated  entities.  Relevant legal and regulatory  bodies have the powers needed  to enforce these requirements.  The effectiveness of law  and regulation in improving  cybersecurity practice is regularly  assessed and used to inform  their future development.  Regulations are updated to  take account of emerging  technologies.  Regulatory frameworks are  sufficiently flexible to cater for  rapidly emerging changes in  the underlying technological or  threat environment.  The country is promoting best  practice legal and regulatory  approaches internationally.  The country is actively involved in  the development of international  agreements to promote  harmonisation and mutual  recognition of cybersecurity laws  and regulations.  41 Cybersecurity Capacity Maturity Model for Nations (CMM) - 2021 Edition  D3  D1  D4  D2  D5  D 4.1  D 4.2  D 4.3  D 4.4  Factor - D 4.1: Legal and Regulatory Provisions Aspect Start-Up Formative Established Strategic Dynamic  Procedural  Cybercrime  Legislation  Specific procedural criminal  law for cybercrime does not  exist. It is not clear how general  criminal procedural law applies  to cybercrime investigations,  prosecutions, and electronic  evidence.  Development of specific  procedural cybercrime  legislation, or amendment of  general procedural criminal law  to adapt to cybercrime cases, has  begun.  Comprehensive criminal  procedural law containing  provisions on the investigation  of cybercrime and evidentiary  requirements has been adopted  and is applied.  The country may have ratified  regional or international  instruments on cybercrime. The  country consistently seeks to  implement these measures into  domestic law.  Procedural laws relating to  cybercrime permit the exchange  of information (and other actions  required) to support successful  cross-border investigation of  cybercrime.  Measures are in place to exceed  minimal baselines specified in  international treaties, where  appropriate.  The country seeks to adapt  procedural cybercrime  legislations to take account of  emerging technologies and their  use.  Procedural cybercrime law is  constructed in a way that it can  cater for dynamic changes in  the underlying technology and  threat environment, without the  need for substantial and lengthy  revision.  The country is actively  contributing to the promotion of  effective procedural cybercrime  legislation and instruments to  improve international cybercrime  investigations.  Human  Rights Impact  Assessment  Substantive and procedural  cybercrime legislation and  cybersecurity regulations may be  in development, but no human  rights impact assessments have  been carried out.  Human rights impact  assessments of substantive and  procedural cybercrime legislation  and cybersecurity regulations  may have been conducted,  including consideration of privacy  and freedom of expression  implications. Some issues,  however, have yet to be resolved.  Relevant human rights experts  have been consulted in the  development of the legislation  and regulation.  Full human rights impact  assessments of substantive and  procedural cybercrime legislation  and cybersecurity regulations  have been completed and  international standards are met.  Implementation of this legislation  is monitored on a regular basis  for human rights compliance, and  this is independently verified.  Human rights impact  assessments are regularly  reviewed to ensure that practice  remains compatible with human  rights requirements, and that the  effect of emerging technologies  is considered.  Consideration has also been  given to how cybersecurity  can enhance human rights  protection within the country  and internationally.  The country is actively  contributing to the development  and promotion of human rights  impact assessments as they  relate to cybersecurity.  42 Cybersecurity Capacity Maturity Model for Nations (CMM) - 2021 Edition  D3  D1  D4  D2  D5  D 4.1  D 4.2  D 4.3  D 4.4  Factor - D 4.2: Related Legislative Frameworks Aspect Start-Up Formative Established Strategic Dynamic  Data  Protection  Legislation  Data protection legislation does  not exist.  Data protection legislation is in  development.  Stakeholders from relevant  sectors have been consulted to  support the development of this  legislation.  Comprehensive data protection  legislation in line with  international standards and best  practice has been adopted and is  enforced.  A lead agency responsible  for data protection has been  designated.  The effectiveness of data  protection legislation is regularly  assessed and used to inform its  development.  The country seeks to adapt data  protection laws to take account  of emerging technologies and  their use.  Data protection legislation  is constructed so that it can  cater for dynamic changes in  the underlying technology and  threat environment, without the  need for substantial and lengthy  revision.  The country is developing  and promoting international  standards for data protection  legislation.  The country is actively involved  in the development of legal  instruments to enable improved  international collaboration in  this area.  Child  Protection  Online  Legislation relating to child  protection is limited and  its application in the online  environment is yet to be  considered.  Legislation related to child  protection is in place and is being  adapted to reflect its application  in the online environment.  Stakeholders from relevant  sectors have been consulted to  support the development and  adaptation of this legislation.  The application of child  protection in the online  environment is understood and  reflected in relevant legislation.  Legislation is implemented in line  with international standards and  best practice.  The effectiveness of online  child protection law is regularly  assessed and used to inform its  development.  The country seeks to adapt child  protection law to take account  of emerging technologies and  their use.

The country is actively involved  in the development of legal  instruments to enable improved  international collaboration in  this area.  43 Cybersecurity Capacity Maturity Model for Nations (CMM) - 2021 Edition  D3  D1  D4  D2  D5  D 4.1  D 4.2  D 4.3  D 4.4  Factor - D 4.2: Related Legislative Frameworks Aspect Start-Up Formative Established Strategic Dynamic  Consumer  Protection  Legislation  Legislation related to consumer  protection is limited and  its application in the online  environment is yet to be  considered.  Legislation related to consumer  protection is in place and is being  adapted to reflect its application  in the online environment.  Stakeholders from relevant  sectors have been consulted to  support the development of this  legislation.  The application of consumer  protection in the online  environment is understood and  reflected in relevant legislation.  Legislation is implemented in line  with international standards and  best practice.  The effectiveness of online  consumer protection law is  regularly assessed and used to  inform its development.  The country seeks to adapt  consumer protection legislation  to take account of emerging  technologies and their use.  Consumer protection legislation  is constructed so that it can  cater for dynamic changes in  the underlying technology and  threat environment, without the  need for substantial and lengthy  revision.  The country is developing  and promoting international  standards for online consumer  protection law.  The country is actively involved  in the development of legal  instruments to enable improved  international collaboration in  this area.  Intellectual  Property  Legislation  Legislation related to intellectual  property protection is limited  and its application in the  online environment is yet to be  considered.  Legislation related to intellectual  property protection is in place  and is being adapted to reflect  its application in the online  environment.

Traditional investigative  measures are applied to  cybercrime investigations, but  digital investigation capacity is  limited.  Law enforcement officers may  receive training on cybercrime  and digital evidence, but it is ad  hoc.  A comprehensive institutional  capacity with sufficient human,  procedural and technological  resources to investigate  cybercrime cases has been  established.  Digital chain of custody and  evidence integrity is established,  including formal processes, roles  and responsibilities.  Standards for the training of  law enforcement officers on  cybercrime and digital evidence  exist and are implemented.  The respective roles of national  and state/local law enforcement  agencies are understood and  state-/local-level forces are  equipped to undertake their role.  Quantified risk assessments are  used to allocate resources to  operational cybercrime units (at  national and state/local levels).  Trends and statistics on  cybercrime, law enforcement  interventions and their impact  on harm reduction are collected,  analysed and used to inform  strategy and long-term resource  allocation decision.  Law enforcement strategies  include crime prevention  measures alongside enforcement  measures. Intelligence is used to  support proactive investigation.  Law enforcement agencies have  the capabilities to maintain  the integrity of data to meet  international evidential standards  in cross-border investigation.  The country is actively involved in  the development of collaborative  platforms between national law  enforcement authorities.  The law enforcement agencies  within the country are at the  forefront of developing new  capabilities and approaches for  the prevention and disruption of  cybercrime and promoting their  use internationally.  Prosecution  Prosecutors do not receive  adequate training and resources  to review electronic evidence or  prosecute cybercrime.  Consultation may have begun  to consider this capacity in the  prosecutor community.  A limited number of prosecutors  have the capacity to conduct  cybercrime cases and to handle  electronic evidence, but this  capacity is largely ad hoc and is  not institutionalised.  If prosecutors receive training on  cybercrime and digital evidence,  it is ad hoc.  A comprehensive institutional  capacity, including sufficient  human and technological  resources, to prosecute  cybercrime cases and cases  involving electronic evidence is  established.  A specialist cadre of cybercrime  prosecutors may have been  established.  Institutional structures are in  place, with a clear distribution of  tasks and obligations within the  prosecution services at all levels  of the state.  A mechanism exists that enables  the exchange of information  and good practices between  prosecutors and judges to  ensure efficient and effective  prosecution of cybercrime cases.  There is national capacity to  prosecute complex domestic and  cross-border cybercrime cases.  45 Cybersecurity Capacity Maturity Model for Nations (CMM) - 2021 Edition  D3  D1  D4  D2  D5  D 4.1  D 4.2  D 4.3  D 4.4  Factor - D 4.3: Legal and Regulatory Capability and Capacity Aspect Start-Up Formative Established Strategic Dynamic  Courts  There is no process to equip  judges so they can preside  over cybercrime cases or cases  involving electronic evidence.  Consultation may have begun  to consider this capacity in the  judicial community.  A limited number of judges  have the capacity to preside  over a cybercrime case, but this  capacity is largely ad hoc.  If judges receive training on  cybercrime and digital evidence,  it is ad hoc.  Sufficient human and  technological resources are  available to ensure effective  and efficient legal proceedings  regarding cybercrime cases  and cases involving electronic  evidence.  Judges receive specialised  training about cybercrime and  electronic evidence.  States/local courts are equipped  to deal with cybercrime cases,  appropriate to their level.  Relevant courts are equipped to  process civil litigation relating to  cybersecurity liability.  The institutional capacity of  the court system to conduct  cybercrime cases is frequently  reviewed and revised based on  an assessment of effectiveness.  The country is actively involved  in developing and promoting  best practices in the conduct of  cybercrime cases.  Regulatory  Bodies  Sector-specific regulators have  limited understanding of the  potential impact of cyber on  their regulated entities.  There is no cross-sector  regulatory body to supervise  specific cybersecurity  requirements.  Sector-specific regulators  have started to establish their  cybersecurity roles.  A requirement for the  establishment of cross-sector  regulatory bodies to oversee  compliance with specific  cybersecurity regulations may  have been considered.  Relevant stakeholders have been  consulted in this process.  Sector-specific regulators (e.g.:  finance, energy, transport) are  equipped with the capability and  resources required to oversee  compliance with cybersecurity  requirements within their sector.  Where cross-sector regulatory  bodies have been established to  oversee cybersecurity, they have  the necessary capability and  resources to undertake their role.  The impact of regulatory actions  on organisations’ cybersecurity  practices are regularly assessed  and used to inform supervisory  activity and regulation  development.  Regulatory bodies regularly  assess emerging technologies  and their potential impact on  the cybersecurity of regulated  entities.  Regulatory interventions and  investigations are informed by,  and prioritised on the basis of,  national assessments of cyber  risk.  Regulatory bodies are actively  involved in the development and  promotion of regulatory best  practice internationally.  46 Cybersecurity Capacity Maturity Model for Nations (CMM) - 2021 Edition  D3  D1  D4  D2  D5  D 4.1  D 4.2  D 4.3  D 4.4  Factor - D 4.4: Formal and Informal Co-operation Frameworks to Combat Cybercrime Aspect Start-Up Formative Established Strategic Dynamic  Law  Enforcement  Co-operation  with Private  Sector  Co-operation between domestic  public and private sectors on  cybercrime is limited.  Specifically, co-operation  between Internet service and  other technology providers and  law enforcement has not been  established.  Exchange of information on  cybercrime between domestic  public and private sectors is ad  hoc and unregulated.  Specifically, ad-hoc co-operation  between Internet service and  other technology providers and  law enforcement exists but is not  always effective.  Information is regularly  exchanged between domestic  public and private sectors and  is supported by appropriate  legislation.  Effective co-operation  mechanisms between Internet  service and other technology  providers and law enforcement  have been established as  part of these broader public– private sector collaboration  arrangements.  The effectiveness of public and  private co-operation is regularly  assessed and used to enhance  collaborative processes.  Collaboration frameworks  are regularly adapted to take  account of new technologies and  emerging forms of cybercrime.  The country is actively  contributing to the promotion of  public–private partnership and  the development of international  public–private partnership  platforms.  Co-operation  with  Foreign Law  Enforcement  Counterparts  There are minimal or no forms  of international co-operation to  prevent and combat cybercrime.  Formal mechanisms of  international law enforcement  co-operation may exist, but their  application to cybercrime is ad  hoc or only possible in some  cases.  Law enforcement is not formally  integrated into regional and  international cybercrime  networks.  Formal mechanisms of  international law enforcement  co-operation have been  established to facilitate the  detection, investigation, and  prosecution of cybercrime.  Mutual legal assistance,  extradition agreements and  mechanisms have been  established and are applied to  cybercrime cases.  Domestic law enforcement  agencies are integrated with  regional and international  networks, such as Interpol or  24/7 networks.  Law enforcement agencies work  jointly with foreign counterparts,  potentially through joint task  forces, resulting in successful  cross-border cybercrime  investigations and prosecutions.  The country actively contributes  to the promotion and  development of international  co-operation mechanisms.  Government- Criminal  Justice Sector  Collaboration  There is minimal interaction  between government and  criminal justice actors.  Exchange of information  between government and  criminal justice actors is limited  and ad hoc.  Formal relationships between  government and criminal justice  actors have been established,  resulting in the regular exchange  of information on cybercrime  issues.  The relationship between  government actors, prosecutors,  judges and law enforcement  agencies is regularly assessed  and used to enhance their  effectiveness.  The country actively contributes  to the international promotion  of efficient and timely exchange  of information between  government and criminal justice  actors.  47 Cybersecurity Capacity Maturity Model for Nations (CMM) - 2021 Edition  D3  D1  D4  D2  D5  D 5.1  D 5.2  D 5.3  D 5.4  D 5.5  D 5.6  Dimension 5: Standards  and Technologies  This Dimension addresses effective and widespread  use of cybersecurity technology to protect individuals,  organisations and national infrastructure.

Or initial identification of  some appropriate standards  and good practices has been  made by the public and  private sectors, and possibly  some ad-hoc implementation,  but no concerted endeavour  to implement or change  existing practice in a  measurable way.  Information risk management  standards have been identified  for use and there have been  some initial signs of promotion  and take-up within public and  private sectors.  There is some evidence of  measurable implementation  and use of international  standards and good practices.  A nationally-agreed baseline of  cybersecurity-related standards  and good practices have been  identified and implemented  widely across public and private  sectors.  An entity within government  exists to assess the use of  standards across public and  private sectors.  Government schemes exist  to promote continued  enhancements, and metrics  are being applied to monitor  compliance.  Consideration is being given as to  how standards and best practices  can be used to address risk  within supply chains within the  CI, by both government and CI.  Government and organisations  promote use of standards and best  practices according to assessment of  national risks and budgetary choices.  The choice of standards and best  practices and their implementation is  continuously revised.  Emerging cybersecurity risks are  regularly assessed and used to re- evaluate the need for additional ICT  security standards.  There is evidence of debate between  government and other stakeholders  as to how national and organisational  resource decisions should align and  drive implementation of standards.  Evidence of contribution to  international standards’ bodies  exists and contributes to thought  leadership and sharing of experience  by organisations.  The country is actively involved  in the development and  promotion of defined standards  internationally.  Implementation of standards and  non-compliance decisions are  made in response to changing  threat environments and  resource drivers across sectors  and CI, through collaborative risk  management.  Evidence exists of debate within  all sectors on compliance to  standards and best practices,  based on continuous needs  assessments.  51 Cybersecurity Capacity Maturity Model for Nations (CMM) - 2021 Edition  D3  D1  D4  D2  D5  D 5.1  D 5.2  D 5.3  D 5.4  D 5.5  D 5.6  Factor - D 5.1: Adherence to Standards Aspect Start-Up Formative Established Strategic Dynamic  Standards in  Procurement  No standards or best practices  have been identified for  use in guiding procurement  processes by the public and  private sectors. If they are  recognised, implementation  is ad hoc and un-co-ordinated.  Cybersecurity standards  and best practices guiding  procurement processes  (including risk management,  lifecycle management, software  and hardware assurance,  outsourcing, and use of cloud  services) have been identified  for use.  Evidence of promotion  and implementation of  cybersecurity standards and  best practices in defining  procurement practices exists  within public and private  sectors.  Cybersecurity standards and  best practices in guiding  procurement processes (including  risk management, lifecycle  management, software and  hardware assurance, outsourcing,  and use of cloud services) are  being adhered to widely within  public and private sectors.  Implementation and compliance  of standards in procurement  practices within the public and  private sectors is evidenced  through measurement and  assessments of process  effectiveness.  Organisations have the ability to  monitor and change use of standards  and best practices in procurement  processes, support deviations and  non-compliance decisions as the need  arises through risk-based decision- making.  Emerging cybersecurity risks are  regularly assessed and used to  re-evaluate the need for additional  standards in procurement.  Critical aspects of procurement  and supply, such as total lifecycle  cost, quality, inter-operability,  maintenance, support and other value- adding activities, are continuously  improved, and procurement process  improvements are made in the context  of wider resource planning.  Organisations are able to benchmark  the skills of their procurement  professionals against the competencies  outlined in procurement standards and  identify any skills and capability gaps.  The country is actively involved  in the development and  promotion of these standards  internationally.  Implementation of standards in  procurement processes and non- compliance decisions are made  in response to changing threat  environments.  Standards for  Provision of  Products and  Services  Either no standards or  best practices have been  identified for use in securing  the products and services  (in particular, software,  hardware, managed services  and cloud services) developed  or offered by providers in the  country.  Or there is some  identification, but only limited  evidence of take-up.  Core activities and  methodologies for secure  development and lifecycle  management for software,  hardware and provision of  managed services and cloud  services are being identified and  discussed within professional  communities.  Government promotes  relevant standards in software  development, hardware  quality assurance, provision  of managed services and  cloud security but there is  no evidence of widespread  adoption of these standards yet.  There is evidence of widespread  implementation of standards  in the software development  processes, hardware quality  assurance, provision of managed  services and cloud services  by public and private sector  organisations.  Government has an established  programme for promoting and  monitoring standard adoption  in software development,  hardware quality assurance and  cloud security, for public and  commercial systems.  Evidence that high integrity  systems and software  development techniques are  present within the educational  and training offerings in the  country.  Security considerations are  incorporated in all stages of the  development of software, hardware  and provision of managed services  and cloud services.  Core development activities,  including configuration and  documentation management,  security development and lifecycle  planning have been adopted into  the practices of product and service  providers  Projects on software development,  hardware quality assurance,  managed service and cloud security  continuously assess the value of  standards and reduce or enhance  levels of compliance according to  risk-based decisions.  The country is actively involved  in the development and  promotion of these standards  internationally.  Implementation of these  standards and non-compliance  decisions are made in response  to changing threat environments.  52 Cybersecurity Capacity Maturity Model for Nations (CMM) - 2021 Edition  D3  D1  D4  D2  D5  D 5.1  D 5.2  D 5.3  D 5.4  D 5.5  D 5.6  Factor - D 5.2: Security Controls Aspect Start-Up Formative Established Strategic Dynamic  Technological  Security  Controls  There is minimal or no  understanding or deployment  of the technological security  controls available in the  marketplace, by users and public  and private sectors.  Internet service and other  technology providers may not  offer any upstream controls to  their customers.  Technological security controls  are deployed by users and  public and private sectors, but  possibly not consistently across  all sectors.  The deployment of up-to-date  technological security controls  is promoted in an ad-hoc  manner and all sectors are being  incentivised to make use of  them.  Internet service and other  technology providers may be  offering security services as part  of their services but possibly in  an ad-hoc manner.  Internet service and other  technology providers recognise a  need to establish internal policies  for the deployment of technical  security controls, to manage  identified risks in the products  and services they are offering.  Up-to-date technological security  controls, including patching and  backups, are deployed in all  sectors.  Physical security controls are  used to prevent unauthorised  personnel from entering  computing facilities in all sectors.  Internet service and other  technology providers establish  internal policies for the  deployment of technical security  controls, to manage identified  risks in the products and services  they are offering.  The technological cybersecurity  control set reflects  internationally-established  cybersecurity frameworks,  standards and good practice.  Widespread adoption of  technological security controls  leads to effective upstream  protection of users and public  and private sectors.  All sectors have the capacity to  continuously assess the security  controls deployed, for their  effectiveness and suitability  according to their changing  needs.  The understanding of the  technological security controls  being deployed extends to  their impact on organisational  operations and budget allocation.  The public and private sectors  have the capacity to critically  assess and upgrade cybersecurity  controls according to their  appropriateness and suitability  for use, and considering  emerging risks.  There is widespread adoption of  multi-factor authentication for  online services and privileged  accounts. Certificate Authorities  are available and digital  certificates are widely used.  Internet service and other  technology providers have  the ability to prevent access  to non-trusted sites or web  addresses in accordance with the  requirements of the appropriate  regulator.  The application of advanced  technological controls within the  country is a leading influence  internationally.  Implementation of advanced  technological security controls  are made in response to  changing threat environments.  53 Cybersecurity Capacity Maturity Model for Nations (CMM) - 2021 Edition  D3  D1  D4  D2  D5  D 5.1  D 5.2  D 5.3  D 5.4  D 5.5  D 5.6  Factor - D 5.2: Security Controls Aspect Start-Up Formative Established Strategic Dynamic  Cryptographic  Controls  Cryptographic techniques (e.g.:  encryption and digital signatures)  for protection of data at rest and  data in transit may be a concern  but are not yet deployed within  the government or private sector,  or by the general public.  Cryptographic controls for  protecting data at rest and  in transit are recognised and  deployed ad hoc by multiple  stakeholders and within various  sectors.  Tools, such as TLS*, are deployed  ad hoc by service providers  to secure all communications  between servers and users.  Cryptographic techniques are  available for all sectors and users  for the protection of data at rest  or in transit.  There is a broad understanding  of secure communication  services, such as encrypted or  signed email.  The cryptographic controls  deployed meet international  standards and guidelines for each  sector and are kept up to date.  Tools, such as TLS are routinely  deployed by service providers  to secure all communications  between servers and users.  The public and private sectors  critically assess the deployment  of cryptographic controls,  according to their objectives and  priorities.  The public and private  sectors adapt encryption and  cryptographic control policies  based on the evolution of  technological advancement and  changing threat environment.  The public and private sectors  have developed encryption  and cryptographic control  policies based on the previous  assessment, and regularly review  the policies for effectiveness.  The country has considered  implementing digital-identity  management.  The country has considered  whether it requires a national  PKI**.  The country is contributing to  the international debate around  best practice on cryptographic  controls.  Implementation of cryptographic  controls are made in response to  changing threat environments.  * Transport Layer Security ** Public Key Infrastructure  54 Cybersecurity Capacity Maturity Model for Nations (CMM) - 2021 Edition  D3  D1  D4  D2  D5  D 5.1  D 5.2  D 5.3  D 5.4  D 5.5  D 5.6  Factor - D 5.3: Software Quality Aspect Start-Up Formative Established Strategic Dynamic  Software  Quality and  Assurance  Quality and performance of  software used in the country  is a concern, but functional  requirements are not yet fully  monitored.  A catalogue of assured software  platforms and applications within  the public and private sectors  does not exist.  Policies and processes regarding  updates and maintenance  (including patch management) of  software applications have not  yet been formulated.  Software quality and functional  requirements in public and  private sectors are recognised  and identified, but not  necessarily in a strategic manner.  A catalogue for assured software  platforms and applications within  the public and private sectors is  in development.  Policies and processes  on software updates and  maintenance (including patch  management) are now in  development.  Evidence of software quality  deficiencies is being gathered  and assessed regarding its impact  on usability and performance.  Software quality and functional  requirements in public and  private sectors are recognised and  established.  Reliable software applications  that adhere to international  standards and good practices are  being used widely in the public  and private sectors.  Policies on and processes  for software updates and  maintenance (including patch  management) are established in  all sectors.  Software applications are  characterised as to their reliability,  usability and performance in  adherence to international  standards and good practices.  Quality of software used in public  and private sectors is monitored  and assessed.  Policies and processes  on software updates and  maintenance (including patch  management) are being  improved, based on risk  assessments and the critical  nature of services in all sectors.  Benefits to businesses from  additional investment in  ensuring software quality and  maintenance are measured and  assessed.  Software defects are manageable  in a timely manner and service  continuity is ensured.  Software applications of high- level performance, reliability  and usability are available, with  service continuity processes fully  automated.  Requirements of software  quality are being systematically  reviewed, updated, and adapted  to the changing cybersecurity  environment.  55 Cybersecurity Capacity Maturity Model for Nations (CMM) - 2021 Edition  D3  D1  D4  D2  D5  D 5.1  D 5.2  D 5.3  D 5.4  D 5.5  D 5.6  Factor - D 5.4: Communications and Internet Infrastructure Resilience Aspect Start-Up Formative Established Strategic Dynamic  Internet  Infrastructure  Reliability  Affordable and reliable Internet  services and infrastructure in  the country may not have been  established; if they have been,  adoption rates of those services  are a concern.  There is little or no national  oversight of network  infrastructure.  If networks and systems are  outsourced, the reliability of  third-party providers may not  have been considered.  Network redundancy measures  may be considered, but not in  a systematic, comprehensive  fashion.  Limited Internet services and  infrastructure are available, but  with low levels of adoption and  issues of unreliability.  The ability of Internet  infrastructure in public and  private sectors to withstand  incidents with minimum  disruption has been discussed by  multiple stakeholders but may  not have been fully addressed.  Support for securing Internet  infrastructure may rely on  regional assistance.  Reliable Internet services are  widely available and used.  Internet services are trusted  widely for conducting  e-commerce and electronic  business transactions;  appropriate authentication  processes are established.  Technology deployed and  processes used for managing  Internet infrastructure meet  international standards and  follow good practices.  National infrastructure is  formally managed, with  documented processes, roles  and responsibilities, and limited  redundancy.  Regular assessments are made  of technology, of processes for  compliance with international  standards, and of guidelines that  address the national need in  the face of emerging risks, and  changes are made as required.  There is effective and  controlled acquisition of critical  technologies, and there are  managed strategic planning and  service continuity processes in  place.  Acquisition of infrastructure  technologies is effectively  controlled, with flexibility  incorporated according to  changing market dynamics.  Costs for infrastructure  technologies are continually  assessed and optimised.  Scientific, technical, industrial  and human capabilities are  being systematically maintained,  enhanced, and perpetuated in  order to maintain the country’s  independent resilience.  Optimised efficiency is in place  to mediate extended outages of  systems.  Monitoring  and Response  No risk assessments are  conducted by Internet  infrastructure owners to identify  vulnerable assets and prioritise  protective actions.  There is no monitoring in place  to detect that incidents have  occurred.  No incident response plans are  in place.  Processes on developing risk  assessments for Internet  infrastructure owners have been  initiated.  There is ad-hoc monitoring  of parts of the Internet  infrastructure, but it may not be  comprehensive.  Incident response plans are in  development in some sectors.  Mechanisms are in place in  both public and private sectors  to conduct risk assessments,  monitor and test network  resilience, and to respond to  incidents.  Incident response plans are in  place in both public and private  sectors and are regularly tested  and kept under review.  Appropriate resources  are allocated to hardware  integration, technology stress  testing, personnel training,  monitoring, response, and drills  to test response plans.  Risks related to emerging and  converging technologies are  regularly assessed by Internet  Infrastructure owners.  Risks related to emerging and  converging technologies are  regularly assessed by regulatory  agencies responsible for  electronic communications  networks and this is used to  inform funding and priority  decisions.  National-level assets can act  to work with the international  community in the event of a  trans-jurisdictional crisis or  incident.  Lessons learnt from international  collaborations are used to  evolve monitoring and response  capabilities.  Evidence exists that sovereign  novel monitoring and response  capabilities are being developed  in anticipation of emerging  threats.  56 Cybersecurity Capacity Maturity Model for Nations (CMM) - 2021 Edition  D3  D1  D4  D2  D5  D 5.1  D 5.2  D 5.3  D 5.4  D 5.5  D 5.6  Factor - D 5.5: Cybersecurity Marketplace Aspect Start-Up Formative Established Strategic Dynamic  Cybersecurity  Technologies  If domestic production of  cybersecurity technologies  exists, it does not follow secure  processes.  The country has not considered  the security implications of  using foreign cybersecurity  technologies.  If there is domestic production,  the need for secure processes is  recognised.  If there is reliance on foreign  technologies, the security  implications are considered.  If there is domestic production,  secure processes are in place.  If there is reliance on foreign  technologies, the security  implications are identified and  mitigated in the context of an  international supply chain.  If there is local development  of cybersecurity technology,  it abides by secure coding  guidelines, good practices and  adheres to internationally- accepted standards.  Risk assessments and  market incentives inform  the prioritisation of product  development and mitigation of  identified risks.  The security implications of  using foreign technologies are  routinely analysed and revised  based on the assessment of  emerging cybersecurity risks.  Security functions in software  and computer system  configurations are automated  in the development and  deployment of technologies.  Domestic cybersecurity products  are exported to other nations  and are considered superior  products.  The country has established a  body to assure the security of  foreign technologies (devices  and software) and supply chains,  or to certify entities which can  do this.  Cybersecurity  Services and  Expertise  Cybersecurity consultancy  services are not widely on offer  in the country.  Few if any service providers have  professional certification.  There are a growing number  of cybersecurity consultancy  services available for private and  public organisations.  A growing number of service  providers provide detail of the  professional certifications they  possess.  There may be limited or no  guidance to assist organisations  with the selection of service  providers.  There are widespread  cybersecurity consultancy  services available for private and  public organisations.  All service providers provide  details of the professional  certifications they possess.  A national body accredits service  providers, to assist organisations  in selecting service providers.  Private and public organisations  routinely seek advice from  cybersecurity consultancy  services, including advice about  emerging risks.  There is an adequate supply of  cybersecurity professionals in the  country.  The cybersecurity service sector  in the country helps shape the  international market.  57 Cybersecurity Capacity Maturity Model for Nations (CMM) - 2021 Edition  D3  D1  D4  D2  D5  D 5.1  D 5.2  D 5.3  D 5.4  D 5.5  D 5.6  Factor - D 5.5: Cybersecurity Marketplace Aspect Start-Up Formative Established Strategic Dynamic  Security  Implications of  Outsourcing  No risk assessments are  conducted to determine how to  mitigate the risks of outsourcing  IT to a third party or cloud  services.  There is a lack of understanding  of the security measures that the  outsourced IT service provider  applies.  Some organisations and sectors  conduct risk assessments to  determine how to mitigate the  risks of outsourcing IT to a third  party or cloud services.  At least some organisations and  sectors understand the security  measures that the outsourced IT  service provider applies.  At least some organisations have  developed business continuity  and disaster recovery processes.  Most major organisations from  the public and private sectors  conduct risk assessments to  determine how to mitigate the  risks of outsourcing IT to a third  party or cloud services.  There is widespread  understanding of the security  guarantees provided by the  outsourced IT service providers.  Most organisations have  developed and tested processes  to support business continuity  and disaster recovery.  Insights arising from risk  assessments are routinely  analysed in order to establish  and promote cybersecurity best  practices to mitigate the risk of  outsourcing IT.  Different risk scenarios with the  IT service provider are explored  and tested, including emerging  risks.  The country is contributing  to international best practice  on how to mitigate the risk of  outsourcing IT.  Cyber  Insurance  The need for a cyber-insurance  market may have been identified,  but no products and services  are widely available, either  domestically or from external  providers.  The need for a market in cyber- insurance has been identified  through the assessment of  financial risks for the public  and private sectors, and the  appropriateness of available  offerings is now being discussed.  A market for cyber-insurance is  established and encourages the  sharing of threat- information  among participants of the  market.  Products suitable for small and  medium-sized enterprises (SMEs)  are also on offer.  Cyber-insurance market offers  a variety of covers to mitigate  consequential losses.  Cover is selected by organisations  based on strategic planning  needs and identified risk.  The cyber-insurance market  is innovative and adapts to  emerging risks, standards and  practices, while addressing the  full scope of cyber harm.  Insurance premium reductions  are offered for consistent cyber- secure behaviour.  Cyber-insurance practices in  the country help to shape the  international market.  58 Cybersecurity Capacity Maturity Model for Nations (CMM) - 2021 Edition  D3  D1  D4  D2  D5  D 5.1  D 5.2  D 5.3  D 5.4  D 5.5  D 5.6  Factor - D 5.6: Responsible Disclosure Aspect Start-Up Formative Established Strategic Dynamic  Sharing  Vulnerability  Information  There is no informal way of  sharing information among the  stakeholders about the technical  details of vulnerabilities.  Software and service providers  generally lack the ability to  address bug and vulnerability  reports.  Technical details of vulnerabilities  are shared informally with other  stakeholders which can distribute  the information more broadly.  Software and service providers  are able to address bug and  vulnerability reports but there  may not be formal protocols for  doing so.  There are formal information- sharing mechanisms or channels  in place to share the technical  details of vulnerabilities with  other stakeholders, which can  distribute the information more  broadly.  A substantial proportion of  vulnerabilities in products and  services are remedied within  defined deadlines after their  discovery.  Vulnerability information-sharing  mechanisms are continuously  reviewed and updated based  on the needs of all affected  stakeholders, and in the light of  emerging risks.  All affected products and services  are routinely updated within  defined deadline.  Processes are in place to review  and reduce deadlines where  possible.  The country is contributing to  the debate and international  best practice on the sharing of  vulnerability information.  Policies,  Processes and  Legislation for  Responsible  Disclosure of  Security Flaws  The need for a responsible- disclosure policy in public and  private sector organisations, and  the right to legal protections for  those disclosing security flaws  are not yet acknowledged.  The need for a responsible- disclosure policy in public and  private sector organisations  is recognised but policies or  processes may not be in place, or  may only be in development.  The right to legal protections for  those disclosing security flaws is  recognised but legislation may  not be in place; or may only be in  development.  Software and service providers  commit to refraining from  taking legal action against a  party disclosing information  responsibly.  A responsible-disclosure  policy or framework is in place  in public and private sector  organisations, and includes a  disclosure deadline, scheduled  resolution, and the need for  acknowledgement.  Organisations have established  processes to receive and  disseminate vulnerability  information responsibly.  The right to legal protections for  those disclosing security flaws  responsibly is in place.  Responsible-disclosure policies  and processes are continuously  reviewed and updated based  on the needs of all affected  stakeholders and in the light of  emerging risks.  An analysis of the technical  details of vulnerabilities  is published and advisory  information is disseminated  according to individual roles and  responsibilities.  The country is contributing to the  debate on responsible-disclosure  frameworks and legal protections  for those disclosing security flaws  responsibly.  59 Cybersecurity Capacity Maturity Model for Nations (CMM) - 2021 Edition  D3  D4  D2  D5  D1  This CMM 2021 Edition builds on the success of the model over the last six years by considering  the changing cyber threat to users, the lessons learned from more than 120 CMM reviews  undertaken around the world, and the feedback from cybersecurity experts.  The decision to revise the CMM was informed by two key factors:  • The need to respond to all pertinent aspects of threat, systems vulnerabilities and  consequential harm due to changing operational environments and risks; and  • Re-assessment of the changing cybersecurity control landscape and risk management  practices available to the community.  To determine whether or not to propose a change to the CMM, or to the evidence required to  justify an attainment of capacity maturity, the following decision process was followed.  All potential changes to be included in the CMM 2021 Edition had to meet the following criteria:  • Each change must have been proposed by partners, users, or expert advisors. It must be  based on experience in deploying the model, feedback from a country which has used the  model or from a member of the international stakeholder community with particular insight  into changing environments that need be taken into account;  • The change must have been discussed with the GCSCC Expert Advisory Panel, regional,  strategic and implementation partners and other experts during the online conference calls  and/or one-to-one online meetings. Clear consensus must have been reached amongst the  attendees;  • The change must have been discussed at the CMM Revision Workshop in February 2020.  Clear consensus must have been reached amongst attendees;  • Global Constellation partners and strategic and implementation partners must have been  consulted; and  • Members of the GCSCC Technical Board must agree that the changes are desirable.  Those criteria that did not meet the requirements were documented as requiring further  research and consultation.

    "original document": "Cybersecurity Capacity Maturity Model for Nations (CMM) 2021 EDITION  D1  The world’s economies continue to develop with an ever- increasing dependence on technology. If we do not ensure  that cybersecurity capacity exists across the entirety of  cyberspace, we will inevitably create cyber-ghettos. In such  environments, cyber-harm may become prevalent and cyber- attacks can easily be launched. The ability of countries to  respond and grow capacity in the face of changing threats  – be they due to trends in technology use, the socio-political  climate, or evolution of the threat-actor ecosystem – has  never been more important.  The Cybersecurity Capacity Maturity Model for Nations  (CMM) helps nations understand what works, what  does not work and why, across all areas of cybersecurity  capacity. This is important so that governments and  enterprises can adopt policies and make investments that  have the potential to significantly enhance safety and  security in cyberspace, while also respecting human rights,  such as privacy and freedom of expression.  Since 2015, the Global Cyber Security Capacity Centre  (GCSCC, Capacity Centre) has actively promoted the CMM  across sectors, to drive conversation around cybersecurity  capacity and to help improve global technology. The  resulting adoption of the CMM by various key international  stakeholders, and the completion of more than 120 CMM  reviews in more than 85 countries around the world,  demonstrates the positive impact of the research, supports  government self-assessments and informs the development  of industry tools and resources.  Prompted by the changing threat landscape and  corresponding cybersecurity practice, the GCSCC has led a  revision of the CMM, the first to be carried out since the  2016 edition was issued. To produce this 2021 edition, the  Executive Summary Capacity Centre undertook a global collaborative exercise  aimed at extracting and synthesising the community’s latest  knowledge. The GCSCC developed change proposals based  on lessons learned from CMM deployments, and undertook  a series of online and offline consultations with experts, to  validate the findings and discuss the changes. Those who  were consulted included the GCSCC Expert Advisory Panel,  strategic, regional and implementation partners of the  GCSCC, and other experts from academia, international and  regional organisations, governments, the private sector, and  civil society. Based on their input, indicators for each Aspect  have been identified, designed, refined, and validated.  Actors around the world, ranging from individuals to nation  states, need to ensure that cyberspace and the systems  dependent on it are resilient to increasing attacks. The  CMM 2021 Edition and its deployment will continue to  contribute towards efforts to achieve this resilience, not only  by gaining a more profound understanding of international  cybersecurity capacity, but also by increasing effective  investment into cybersecurity capacity based on a rigorous  analysis of data collected from the deployment of the  model. Critical gaps in all areas of international cybersecurity  will be identified and filled with scalable and effective  countermeasures, in co-operation with international  partners from the global cybersecurity community.  The enhancement of the CMM is not intended to be a  static exercise; a continuous process of refinement will  be maintained to ensure the CMM remains applicable  to all national contexts and reflects the global state of  cybersecurity capacity maturity. However, this evolution  will continue to be a considered exercise, stimulated by  evidence and practice.

The output is an evidence- based report which:  • benchmarks the maturity of a country’s cybersecurity  capacity;  • details a pragmatic set of actions to contribute to the  advancement of cybersecurity capacity maturity gaps; and  • identifies priorities for investment and future capacity- building, based on a country’s specific needs.  According to an independent study commissioned by the  UK Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office, the  benefits of a CMM review for a country are numerous and  include:  • increased cybersecurity awareness and capacity building,  and greater collaboration within government;  • networking and collaboration with business and wider  society;  A National Cybersecurity  Assessment with the CMM  • the enhancement of the internal credibility of the  cybersecurity agenda within governments;  • help in defining roles and responsibilities within  governments;  • providing evidence to increase funding for cybersecurity  capacity building; and  • a foundation for country strategy and policy development.  It is important that a country can evidence its achievements  in cybersecurity capacity and the CMM identifies what that  evidence should be, and what it demonstrates. Such evidence  gathering is in itself a multi-stakeholder process, involving a  wide range of sources and organisations. Discussions can be  important to resolve differences of opinion. Whether such  discussions can be effective if done remotely (and online), or  will necessitate face-to-face meetings, will depend upon the  country undertaking a review.

Developing cybersecurity policy and strategy;  2. Encouraging responsible cybersecurity culture within society;  3. Building cybersecurity knowledge and capabilities;  4. Creating effective legal and regulatory frameworks; and  5. Controlling risks through standards and technologies.

This Dimension considers effective strategy and policy  in delivering national cybersecurity capability, while maintaining the benefits of a  cyberspace vital for government, international business and society in general.  Dimension 2 Cybersecurity Culture and Society reviews important elements of a  responsible cybersecurity culture such as the understanding of cyber-related risks  in society, the level of trust in Internet services, e-government and e-commerce  services, and users’ understanding of personal information protection online.  Moreover, this Dimension explores the existence of reporting mechanisms  functioning as channels for users to report cybercrime. In addition, this Dimension  reviews the role of media and social media in shaping cybersecurity values,  attitudes and behaviour.  Dimension 3 Building Cybersecurity Knowledge and Capabilities reviews the  availability, quality and uptake of programmes for various groups of stakeholders,  including the government, private sector and the population as a whole, and relate  to cybersecurity awareness-raising programmes, formal cybersecurity educational  programmes, and professional training programmes.  Dimension 4 Legal and Regulatory Frameworks examines the government’s  capacity to design and enact national legislation that directly and indirectly  relates to cybersecurity, with a particular emphasis placed on the topics of  regulatory requirements for cybersecurity, cybercrime-related legislation and  related legislation. The capacity to enforce such laws is examined through law  enforcement, prosecution, regulatory bodies and court capacities. Moreover, this  Dimension observes issues such as formal and informal co-operation frameworks  to combat cybercrime.  Dimension 5 Standards and Technologies addresses effective and widespread  use of cybersecurity technology to protect individuals, organisations and national  infrastructure. This Dimension specifically examines the implementation of  cybersecurity standards and good practices, the deployment of processes and  controls, and the development of technologies and products in order to reduce  cybersecurity risks.  The CMM defines five Stages of maturity for all Dimensions being: start-up,  formative, established, strategic, and dynamic. These correspond to the following:  initial development of capacity, being established, being world-leading, and able to  anticipate and prepare for future cybersecurity needs.  It should be noted that there are relationships between the Dimensions; for example,  to be effective in one area of capacity often places requirements on other areas1. It  is also the case that resources are limited and priorities for capacity enhancements  are likely to require a response which could span multiple Dimensions. Therefore,  a benchmarking activity reviews a country against the entire CMM and across all  Dimensions, enabling an holistic consideration of national capacity.  1 For a country to reach an established level of maturity under the Aspect ‘Initiatives by Government’ in Factor 3.1 Building Cybersecurity Awareness, one of the requirements that must be met is that the content  of the co-ordinated national cybersecurity awareness-raising programme includes explicit links to national cybersecurity strategy. Similarly, for a country to reach an established level of maturity under the Aspect  ‘Administration’ in Factor 3.2 Cybersecurity Education, cybersecurity education priorities resulting from the multi-stakeholder consultation process should be reflected in the national cybersecurity strategy.

Each Dimension is constituted by a range of Factors, which capture the core  capacities required to deliver the Dimension. Together, they represent the different ‘lenses’  through which cybersecurity capacity can be evidenced and analysed.  Factor  Within the five Dimensions, Factors describe what it means to possess cybersecurity  capacity. These are the essential elements of national capacity, which are then measured for  maturity Stage. The complete list of Factors seeks to holistically incorporate all of a nation’s  cybersecurity capacity needs. Most Factors are composed of a number of Aspects which  structure the Factor’s Indicators into more concise parts (which directly relate to evidence  gathering and measurement). However, some Factors that are more limited in scope do not  have specific Aspects.  Aspect  Where a Factor possesses multiple components, these are Aspects. Aspects are an  organisational method to divide Indicators into smaller clusters that are easier to  comprehend. The number of Aspects depends on the themes that emerge in the content of  the Factor and the overall complexity of the Factor.  Stage  Stages define the degree to which a country has progressed in relation to a certain Factor or  Aspect of cybersecurity capacity. The CMM consists of five distinct Stages of maturity: start-up,  formative, established, strategic, dynamic (detailed on page 8). A CMM review will benchmark  a country against these Stages, capturing existing cybersecurity capacity, from which a country  can improve or decline depending on the actions taken (or inaction). Within each Stage there  are a number of Indicators which a country has to fulfil to successfully have reached the Stage.  Indicator  Indicators represent the most basic part of CMM’s structure. Each Indicator describes  the steps, actions, or building blocks that are indicative of a specific Stage of maturity. To  have successfully reached a Stage of maturity, a country will need to convince itself that it  can evidence each of the Indicators. In order to elevate a country’s cybersecurity capacity  maturity, all of the Indicators within a particular Stage will need to have been fulfilled. Most  of these Indicators are binary in nature, i.e., the country can either evidence it has fulfilled  the Indicator criteria, or it cannot provide such evidence.

A CMM review will benchmark a country against these Stages, capturing existing cybersecurity capacity.  Start-up  At this Stage, either no cybersecurity maturity exists, or it is very embryonic in nature. There might be initial discussions about  cybersecurity capacity building, but no concrete actions have been taken. There may be an absence of observable evidence at  this Stage;  Formative  Some features of the Aspect have begun to grow and be formulated, but may be ad hoc, disorganised, poorly defined or simply  new. However, evidence of this activity can be clearly demonstrated;  Established  The Indicators of the Aspect are in place, and evidence shows that they are working. There is not, however, well thought-out  consideration of the relative allocation of resources. Little trade-off decision-making has been made concerning the relative  investment in the various elements of the Aspect. But the Aspect is functional and defined;  Strategic  Choices have been made about which parts of the Aspect are important, and which are less important for the particular  organisation or nation. The strategic Stage reflects the fact that these choices have been made, conditional upon the nation or  organisation’s particular circumstances; and  Dynamic  At this Stage, there are clear mechanisms in place to alter national strategy depending on the prevailing circumstances, such  as the technology of the threat environment, global conflict, or a significant change in one area of concern (e.g. cybercrime  or privacy). There is also evidence of global leadership on cybersecurity issues. Key sectors, at least, have devised methods  for changing strategies at any stage during their development. Rapid decision-making, reallocation of resources, and constant  attention to the changing environment are feature of this Stage.  The CMM allows the benchmarking of current national cybersecurity capacity. Understanding the requirements to achieve  higher levels of capacity will directly indicate areas for further investment, and how to evidence such capacity levels. The CMM  can also be used to build business cases for investment and expected performance enhancements. Combining a CMM review  with national risk assessments, social, and economic strategies can further prioritise which capacity enhancements to make.

Factor D 1.2: Incident Response and Crisis Management  This Factor addresses the capacity of the government  to identify and determine characteristics of national  level incidents in a systematic way. It also reviews the  government’s capacity to organise, co-ordinate, and  operationalise incident response, and whether cybersecurity  has been integrated into the national crisis management  framework  > Navigate to Factor  Aspects • Identification and Categorisation of Incidents: this Aspect  identifies whether internal mechanisms are in place for  identifying and categorising incidents;  • Organisation: this Aspect addresses the existence of a  mandated central body designated to collect incident  information, and its relationship with the public and private  sector for national level incident response; and  • Integration of Cyber into National Crisis Management: this  Aspect explores to what extent cybersecurity is integrated  into the national crisis management framework.  10 Cybersecurity Capacity Maturity Model for Nations (CMM) - 2021 Edition  D3  D1  D4  D2  D5  D 1.1  D 1.2  D 1.3  D 1.4  Factor D 1.3: Critical Infrastructure (CI) Protection  This Factor studies the government’s capacity to identify  CI assets, the regulatory requirements specific to the  cybersecurity of CI, and the implementation of good  cybersecurity practice by CI operators  > Navigate to Factor  Aspects • Identification: this Aspect addresses the existence of a  general list of CI assets, sectors and operators, and an audit  of CI assets on a regular basis;  • Regulatory Requirements: this Aspect addresses the  existence of regulatory requirements specific to the  cybersecurity of CI; and  • Operational Practice: this Aspect explores whether CI  operators implement recognised industry standards, and  the existence of arrangements for collaboration across and  within sectors.  Factor D 1.4: Cybersecurity in Defence  and National Security  This Factor explores whether the government has the capacity  to design and implement a strategy for cybersecurity within  national security and defence. It also reviews the level of  cybersecurity capability within the national security and  defence establishment, and the collaboration arrangements on  cybersecurity between civil and defence entities  > Navigate to Factor  Aspects • Defence Force Cybersecurity Strategy: this Aspect  addresses the existence of a strategy for supporting  cybersecurity within national security and defence,  and whether it is supported by appropriate legal  authorities and relevant operational doctrine and rules of  engagement;  • Defence Force Cybersecurity Capability: this Aspect  reviews the level of cybersecurity capability and  organisational structures within the national security  establishment; and  • Civil Defence Co-ordination: this Aspect examines the  collaboration on cybersecurity between civil and defence  entities, and the existence of adequate resources in place.  11 Cybersecurity Capacity Maturity Model for Nations (CMM) - 2021 Edition  D3  D1  D4  D2  D5  D 1.1  D 1.2  D 1.3  D 1.4  Factor - D 1.1: National Cybersecurity Strategy Aspect Start-Up Formative Established Strategic Dynamic  Strategy  Development  No national cybersecurity  strategy exists, although  planning processes for  strategy development may  have begun.  Advice may have been sought  from international partners.  Processes for strategy  development have been  initiated.  An outline/draft national  cybersecurity strategy has been  articulated.  Consultation processes have  been agreed for key stakeholder  groups, including private sector,  civil society and international  partners.  A national cybersecurity strategy  has been published.  An assessment of country-specific  national cybersecurity risk has been  conducted.  The strategy reflects the needs  and roles of relevant stakeholders  across government (national and  sub-national), business and civil  society.  An implementation programme is  in place which covers the scope of  the strategy.  Mechanisms are in place to enable  strategy ‘owners’ to monitor  achievement of outcomes, address  implementation issues and  maintain strategy alignment.  Strategy review and renewal  processes are in place.  Emerging cybersecurity risks  are regularly assessed and used  to update the strategy and  implementation plan.  The impact of the strategy  on risk and harm reduction is  understood and is used to inform  funding and priority decisions.  The national cybersecurity  strategy and implementation  plan are both proactively  reviewed to take account of  broader strategic developments  within the country (political,  economic, social, technical, legal  and environmental).  The country is an acknowledged  authority within the international  community and is supporting  the development of national and  global cybersecurity strategies.  Cybersecurity considerations are  embedded within other relevant  national-level strategies and  implementation programmes.  Content  Various national policies and  strategies may exist that refer  to cybersecurity, but these  are not comprehensive and  there is little evidence that  these reflect specific national  priorities and circumstances.  Content exists that reflects  country-specific priorities and  circumstances.  Links exist between the strategy  (or draft strategy) and priorities  such as national security,  digital strategy and economic  development, but these are  generally ad hoc and lack detail.  The strategy (or draft strategy)  defines the key outcomes against  which success can be evaluated.  The content of the national  cybersecurity strategy is based on  a comprehensive risk assessment  that includes explicit links to  wider national level economic and  political policies and strategies.  The content includes actions  to raise public and business  awareness, mitigate cybercrime,  establish incident response  capability, promote public-private  partnership and protect critical  infrastructure and the wider  economy.  Consideration has been given to  how the national cybersecurity  strategy might incorporate or  support wider online policy  objectives such as: child protection;  the promotion of Human Rights;  the promotion of Equality, Diversity  and Inclusion; and managing  disinformation.  The content takes account of the  impact on cybersecurity risk of  emerging technologies and their  use within critical infrastructure,  the wider economy and society.  The outcomes defined in  the strategy are specific and  measurable. Metrics have  been defined which enable  stakeholders to evaluate the  effectiveness of the strategy in  reducing harm.  Consideration has been given  to how the beneficial outcomes  of the strategy can be sustained  beyond the strategy’s lifetime,  including how the maintenance  of new capabilities will be  financed.  The content takes account of the  impact of broader developments  on cybersecurity risk (political,  economic, social, technical, legal  and environmental).  The content of the national  cybersecurity strategy promotes  and encourages bilateral and  multilateral co-operation  between countries to ensure  a secure, resilient and trusted  cyberspace.  12 Cybersecurity Capacity Maturity Model for Nations (CMM) - 2021 Edition  D3  D1  D4  D2  D5  D 1.1  D 1.2  D 1.3  D 1.4  Factor - D 1.1: National Cybersecurity Strategy Aspect Start-Up Formative Established Strategic Dynamic  Implementation  and Review  No overarching  national cybersecurity  implementation programme  has been developed.  A co-ordinated cybersecurity  implementation programme is  being developed with relevant  stakeholders involved, including  the private sector and civil  society.  Actions within the programme  have been assigned to specific  ‘owners’ but the availability of  adequate resources has not yet  been confirmed.  Mechanisms to review processes  are limited or ad hoc.  A detailed implementation plan has  been published including actions,  responsible entities and resource  budgets. The implementation plan  involves relevant stakeholders across  government and other sectors.  A co-ordinating body has been  assigned. The body has sufficient  authority to ensure that action  ‘owners’ are held to account.  The resources required to deliver the  actions of the programme have been  identified and are in place. Budget  shortfalls are identified and escalated  to the relevant authority.  Programme review processes and  metrics are in place that allow  progress to be measured and risks,  issues and dependencies to be  escalated to the relevant authority.  These processes are adequately  funded.  Outcome-oriented metrics are  being used to monitor the impact  that the programme is having on  risk reduction (and other relevant  strategy goals).  There is evidence of these  metrics being used to refine  action plans.  Metrics (both progress and  outcome-oriented metrics) are  drawn from a wide variety of  governmental, non-governmental  and international sources.  There is independent oversight  and/or assurance of the  programme.  Mechanisms are in place  to make more far-reaching  changes to the programme in  the event of significant changes  in circumstance (political,  economic, social, technical, legal  and environmental).  The programme contributes  to the global development of  outcome-oriented metrics and  their application.  International  Engagement  There is limited awareness  of the principal international  debates relating to  cybersecurity policy (such  as cybersecurity norms,  mutual legal assistance,  Internet Governance, data  sovereignty, data protection).  The country may benefit  from regional/ international  operational collaboration  networks but does not  actively engage.  The country is aware of the  existence of international  discussions on cybersecurity  policy and related issues.  The country may, on occasion,  participate in regional or  international discussions on  matters related to cybersecurity  issues, but does not generally  play an active role.  The country may participate  in relevant operational  collaboration and policy bodies  (such as FIRST*, regional CERT**  bodies, the IGF***, or the UN  GGE****), but takes mainly a  passive role.  An assessment has been made of  how the international debates on  cybersecurity policy and related  issues affect the country’s interests  and international standing. Specific  engagement objectives have been  defined accordingly. Multiple  stakeholders have been involved in  this process.  The country is actively participating  in relevant international bodies and  forums, either directly or through  relevant representative bodies.  Their voices are being heard and  are having an impact.  The country actively contributes to  regional/ international operational  collaboration and policy bodies.  The country is actively building  international communities  of interest around specific  cybersecurity policy goals and  promoting their adoption.  The country makes a major  contribution to regional/ international operational bodies  and is actively involved in  building capacity in third-party  countries.  The country is a leading actor  in building consensus, fostering  inclusivity and shaping the  international debates on key  cybersecurity policy issues.  The country is focused on the  future, seeing emerging issues  (around new technology or new  types of threat), and is initiating  new international debates  around the key issues.  The country is actively involved  in creating new regional/ international collaboration  mechanisms.  * Forum of Incident Response and Security Teams  ** Computer Emergency Response Team  *** Internet Governance Forum  **** The United Nations Group of Governmental Experts  13 Cybersecurity Capacity Maturity Model for Nations (CMM) - 2021 Edition  D3  D1  D4  D2  D5  D 1.1  D 1.2  D 1.3  D 1.4  Factor - D 1.2: Incident Response and Crisis Management Aspect Start-Up Formative Established Strategic Dynamic  Identification  and  Categorisation  of Incidents  No process for identifying and  categorising national-level  incidents exists.  Some organisations and sectors  have internal mechanisms for  identifying and categorising  incidents within their purview.  A process for identifying  national-level incidents is under  development.  There is no central registry in  place but ad-hoc arrangements  exist for dealing with the most  significant events.  Most major organisations  have internal mechanisms for  identifying and categorising  incidents.  A central registry of national- level cybersecurity incidents  exists and a process for timely  escalation of incidents, from the  organisational to the national  level, is in place.  Individual national incidents are  categorised according to severity  and resources are allocated  accordingly.  Insights arising from national  level incidents are routinely  analysed in order to establish  lessons and inform broader  cybersecurity policy and strategy.  The criteria for categorising  incidents are sufficiently flexible  to cater for rapidly emerging  changes in the underlying  technological or threat  environment.  The country is contributing  to international best practice  in incident identification and  categorisation.  Organisation  No organisation for national-level  cyber incident response exists.  A few organisations may have  internal cybersecurity response  mechanisms in place but co- ordination is minimal.  A national CERT* might exist but  lacks sufficient resources and  skills.  Processes for managing incidents  are still in development.  Some organisations from  public and private sectors have  internal cybersecurity response  mechanisms in place but co- ordination with the national  CERT is ad hoc.  The role of sub-national bodies  is unclear.  Bilateral co-operation with  international partners is limited  or ad hoc.  A national body for incident  response has been established.  It has the resources, skills,  documented processes and legal  authorities required to address  the range of cyber incident  scenarios that the country is likely  to face (including out-of-hours  capability, if appropriate).  Relationships and protocols  are in place to enable incident  management co-ordination  between the national body and  other elements of the public and  private sectors.  The role of sub-national bodies  in incident response is clear  and mechanisms are in place to  enable co-ordination between the  national and sub-national levels.  There is regular sharing of threat  and vulnerability information,  and operational good practices  between the national body and a  wide range of public and private  sector organisations, as well as  international partners.  The national body undertakes  a wide range of engagement  activities such as convening  communities of interest, running  cross-sector exercises and  promoting best cybersecurity  practices.  The national body innovates to  provide a range of additional  services that improve the  country’s ability to prevent,  detect, respond and recover  from threats.  The national body is widely  recognised as an authoritative  voice on cybersecurity within the  country.  The effectiveness of the national  body in reducing cyber risk and  harm is regularly evaluated  and benchmarked against  international good practice.  The government’s overall  operational response is  adaptive to changes in the  underlying technical and threat  environment.  The country is contributing to  international best practice on  how to organise operational  responses to cybersecurity  threats.  * Computer Emergency Response Team  14 Cybersecurity Capacity Maturity Model for Nations (CMM) - 2021 Edition  D3  D1  D4  D2  D5  D 1.1  D 1.2  D 1.3  D 1.4  Factor - D 1.2: Incident Response and Crisis Management Aspect Start-Up Formative Established Strategic Dynamic  Integration of  Cybersecurity  into National  Crisis  Management  No framework exists for national- level crisis management.  Cybersecurity has not been  considered as a potential  national-level crisis scenario.  Emergency communication  capabilities are limited.  A national crisis management  framework is in development  and a specific organisation has  been allocated responsibility  for leading national-level crisis  response.  Cybersecurity has been  recognised as relevant to  national crisis management,  both as a factor in its own right  and as an element of other crisis  scenarios.  An exercise programme is in  development and includes  cybersecurity-based scenarios.  Emergency communication  capabilities are in place but may  not be well integrated or lack  resilience to cyber disruption.  Cybersecurity is fully integrated  into the national crisis  management framework and the  organisation responsible for crisis  management is equipped to deal  with a range of cybersecurity- related scenarios.  The role of a cyber incident  management authority within  the crisis management process is  well defined and established, and  escalation thresholds are fully  understood.  National crisis management  scenarios with cybersecurity  components are regularly  exercised.  Emergency communication  systems are regularly tested  for cyber resilience against a  range of cybersecurity-related  scenarios.  Lessons learnt from cyber crisis  exercises are used to inform  both national crisis management  policy and the national  cybersecurity strategy and  implementation plan.  International crisis planning  and exercising with partners  exists and routinely includes  cybersecurity as an element.  The resilience of emergency  communications has been stress- tested against a wide range of  potential scenarios.  The country is contributing to  the debate on the integration  of cyber into national and  international crisis management.  Emergency communications  capabilities are capable of  operating beyond the country’s  border in order to support third- party countries and global crisis  responses.  15 Cybersecurity Capacity Maturity Model for Nations (CMM) - 2021 Edition  D3  D1  D4  D2  D5  D 1.1  D 1.2  D 1.3  D 1.4  Factor - D 1.3: Critical Infrastructure (CI) Protection Aspect Start-Up Formative Established Strategic Dynamic  Identification  There may be some  appreciation of what  constitutes a CI asset, but no  formal categorisation of CI  assets has been produced.  A list of general CI assets, sectors  and operators has been created.  The list of CI assets has been  formalised and incorporates a range of  appropriate public and private sector  organisations.  Specific operators have been identified  and are aware of their status.  The list is kept up to date to  reflect changes in the country’s  circumstances.  Cross-border dependencies have been  identified.  The list of CI assets is adaptive to  strategic shifts in the underlying  technical, social and economic  environment.  Interdependencies between  sectors are managed.  Cross-border dependencies are  managed.  There is flexibility in the process  for identifying CI assets to cater  for rapidly emerging changes in  the underlying technological or  threat environment.  The country is actively involved  in the identification and  prioritisation of global CI assets.  Cross-sector and cross-border  dependencies are mitigated.  Regulatory  Requirements  There are no existing  regulatory requirements  specific to the cybersecurity  of CI.  The need for baseline  standards to govern CI assets is  acknowledged but these are not  explicitly mandated in regulation.  Sector regulators do not  routinely assess CI operators for  compliance.  CI operators are mandated by  regulation to meet appropriate  cybersecurity standards (either in  the form of specific cyber regulation  or as part of broader regulatory  requirements).  Mandatory breach reporting and  vulnerability disclosure requirements  are in place.  Formal processes are in place to  evaluate CI operator compliance with  regulatory standards and incident and  vulnerability disclosure.  Novel approaches to regulatory  supervision are being developed  to improve CI cybersecurity while  also facilitating effective and  efficient CI service delivery.  The country is promoting best  practice regulatory approaches at  an international level.  Regulatory frameworks are  sufficiently flexible to cater for  rapidly emerging changes in  the underlying technological or  threat environment.  The country is actively involved  in establishing regulatory  approaches to assuring global CI.  Operational  Practice  A few CI operators may  be implementing good  cybersecurity practices, but  this is inconsistent.  Many CI operators are  implementing good cybersecurity  practice.  There is some self-assessment  against recognised industry  standards.  Some informal arrangements  exist for collaboration across and  within sectors.  CI operators are consistently  implementing recognised industry  standards and the effectiveness  of their cybersecurity controls are  regularly assessed.  Mechanisms are in place for operators  to share threat and vulnerability  information, best practices and lessons  learned from incidents and near  misses.  CI operators participate fully in  national incident response and crisis  management planning and exercising.  Mechanisms are in place for public  authorities to provide information and  other practical support to CI operators,  both pre- and post- incident.  There is extensive collaboration  among CI operators and with  public authorities to develop  strategies that enhance collective  cybersecurity.  The resilience of the critical  infrastructure ecosystem as  a whole has been assessed  against a range of scenarios, and  measures are in place to address  systemic risks to the economy  and society.  The country and its CI operators  are contributing to the  international debate on global  critical infrastructure resilience.  Experts from the regulators  and CI operators are recognised  internationally for their  contribution to addressing  global infrastructure protection  challenges.  16 Cybersecurity Capacity Maturity Model for Nations (CMM) - 2021 Edition  D3  D1  D4  D2  D5  D 1.1  D 1.2  D 1.3  D 1.4  Factor - D 1.4: Cybersecurity in Defence and National Security Aspect Start-Up Formative Established Strategic Dynamic  Defence Force  Cybersecurity  Strategy  The potential impact of  cybersecurity on national  security and defence may have  been considered but has not  been formally articulated.  The potential impact of  cybersecurity on national  security and defence has been  assessed and a strategy for  addressing these risks is under  development.  This analysis includes risks to the  ability of the country’s military  and other national security  assets to operate in a contested  cyber environment.  A strategy for cybersecurity for  national security and defence  has been formally adopted  (stand-alone or as part of a wider  document).  The strategy is supported by  appropriate legal authorities and  relevant operational doctrine  and rules of engagement. These  are consistent with international  humanitarian law.  The dependence of national  security and military entities on  the cybersecurity of other parts of  the critical national infrastructure  is understood and is addressed  in the defence cybersecurity  strategy.  Cybersecurity considerations  inform other elements of national  security and defence strategy,  where relevant.  Defence strategy includes  appropriate considerations of  deterrence.  The country’s defence and  national security establishment  (alongside other stakeholders)  is actively engaged in the  global debate on international  humanitarian law and norms  of behaviour as they relate  to conflict in cyberspace.  Declaratory strategy and  published doctrine may be part  of this.  Strategy and doctrine are  not static but are adaptive to  changing capabilities and to the  geo-political and technical threat  environment.  The strategy is designed to  promote stability in cyberspace.  This includes measures to predict  and influence the strategies and  actions and reactions of potential  allies and adversaries.  Defence Force  Cybersecurity  Capability  Specialist cybersecurity capability  within the national security  establishment is limited.  Specialist cybersecurity capability  requirements are understood,  and relevant organisational  structures have been defined.  Initial steps have been taken to  establish these.  Capabilities and organisational  structures are in place and  have been tested. Resourcing is  provided through the national  military estimate or equivalent  process.  Operational doctrine and rules of  engagement are fully embedded  in training.  Specialist intelligence resources  are being applied to provide  support and are appropriately  resourced.  Mechanisms to facilitate  collaboration with allies are in  place and have been tested.  Relevant deterrence and  defence/resilience capabilities  are in place, forming part of the  country’s defence cybersecurity  strategy.  Cybersecurity is embedded in  wider operational and command  training within the country’s  military forces.  Defence cybersecurity  capabilities are able to support  multilateral responses to shared  national security challenges.  17 Cybersecurity Capacity Maturity Model for Nations (CMM) - 2021 Edition  D3  D1  D4  D2  D5  D 1.1  D 1.2  D 1.3  D 1.4  Factor - D 1.4: Cybersecurity in Defence and National Security Aspect Start-Up Formative Established Strategic Dynamic  Civil Defence  Co-ordination  Collaboration on cybersecurity  between civil and defence  entities is limited.  Informal collaboration on  cybersecurity between civil  and defence entities may exist  but has not been formalised.  Defence entities have not been  formally resourced to undertake  this work.  Collaboration on cybersecurity  between civil and defence entities  exists and has been formalised.  Respective roles have been  defined within the country’s crisis  management procedures.  The resources required within  the defence and national security  community, to support civil and  CI authorities, have been formally  assessed and assigned.  Formal mechanisms are in  place to determine military/ national security cybersecurity  dependencies on civil and CI  infrastructure. The ability of civil  and CI infrastructure operators to  provide these services has been  assured.  Civil defence collaboration on  cybersecurity is built into the  strategic planning of both sectors  and designed to address a range  of future crisis scenarios.  Mechanisms are in place that  enable defence and the national  security community to draw on  the skills and capabilities of the  broader economy and society.  (For example, via a formal cyber  reserve force)  The country is leading the  international debate on best  practice in cross-governmental,  civil-defence cybersecurity  collaboration.  18 Cybersecurity Capacity Maturity Model for Nations (CMM) - 2021 Edition  D3  D1  D4  D2  D5  D 2.1  D 2.2  D 2.3  D 2.4  D 2.5  Dimension 2: Cybersecurity  Culture and Society This Dimension reviews important elements of a responsible  cybersecurity culture such as the understanding of cyber- related risks in society, the level of trust in Internet services,  e-government and e-commerce services, and users’  understanding of personal information protection online.

Civil society and other non- government actors lack the  tools and resources to address  online disinformation, such  as exposing misinformation  campaigns.  Government agencies and  actors have not addressed  online disinformation online.  Internet platform providers  are developing approaches to  address issues of disinformation  in this nation.  The development of tools  and resources to address  disinformation have been  initiated by leading civil society  and non-governmental actors.  Government programmes  and initiatives to address  disinformation are being  developed but entail filtering and  limited efforts to inform Internet  users.  Internet platform providers have  a number of approaches in place  to address disinformation; these  respect freedom of expression and  other human rights online.  Civil society stakeholders have  developed tools and resources to  address online disinformation.  Government programmes and  initiatives to strengthen the  public’s preparedness against  online disinformation are  restricted to awareness raising,  but avoid censorship or filtering of  information.  Internet platform providers have  instituted policies and practices  to address disinformation; these  respect freedom of expression  and other human rights online.  The joint efforts of civil society  stakeholders are in place and are  regularly used to address online  disinformation in ways that  respect freedom of expression  and other human rights online.  Outcome-oriented surveys are  used to refine programmes and  initiatives aimed at empowering  users and building the public’s  understanding of possible online  disinformation.  Internet platform providers have  instituted policies and practices  to address disinformation in  some innovative ways that  respect freedom of expression  and other human rights online.  The joint efforts of civil society  stakeholders are proactively  reviewed to take account of  broader strategic developments  related to disinformation and  awareness raising.  The country is supporting the  development of national/ regional/ international action  plans and guidelines to address  disinformation in ways that  protect an open Internet and  empower users.  User Trust in  E-government  Services  Government offers a very  limited number of e-services,  if any, and has not publicly  promoted their security.  Generally, the public does  not use any significant  e-government services.  No surveys or metrics exist to  show how Internet users trust  e-government services.  There is a lack of information  about e-government security  and security breaches.  Government has begun to build  a core set of e-services, for which  they recognise the need to apply  security measures in order to  establish trust in their use.  A limited number of early  adopters trust in the secure use  of e-government services.  Metrics to assess users’ trust in  e-government services is limited  or ad hoc.  Public authorities are developing  information on privacy and  security initiatives and breaches  in an ad-hoc manner.  Key e-government services  have been developed and have  generated a large number of  users.  A sizeable and growing number  of Internet users trust in the use  of e-government services.  Surveys and metrics to assess  users’ trust in e-government  services are in place and  adequately funded.  Public authorities are publishing  information and updates of their  privacy and security breaches  and initiatives such as privacy by  default.  E-government services have  become the dominant (default)  mode of government information  service delivery.  The majority of Internet users in  this country trust in the secure  use of e-government services  and make use of them.  Surveys and metrics to assess  users’ trust in e-government  services are routinely conducted.  Public authorities are co- ordinating, publishing and  informing users about privacy  and security initiatives and  breaches.  E-government services in this  country are recognised regionally  or internationally.  Internet users trust that  e-government services are  proactively reviewed, improved  and expanded to enhance their  security.  Outcome-oriented surveys are  used to review e-government  services and evaluate the  management of online content.  The country is a leader in  informing users about current  and developing privacy and  security breaches, initiatives and  other issues.  24 Cybersecurity Capacity Maturity Model for Nations (CMM) - 2021 Edition  D3  D1  D4  D2  D5  D 2.1  D 2.2  D 2.3  D 2.4  D 2.5  Factor - D 2.2: Trust and Confidence in Online Services Aspect Start-Up Formative Established Strategic Dynamic  User Trust in  E-commerce  Services  E-commerce services are not  offered.

Outcome-oriented surveys are  used to review and improve  e-commerce services in order  to promote transparent,  trustworthy and secure systems.  Terms and conditions provided  by e-commerce services are clear  and easily comprehensible to all  users.  25 Cybersecurity Capacity Maturity Model for Nations (CMM) - 2021 Edition  D3  D1  D4  D2  D5  D 2.1  D 2.2  D 2.3  D 2.4  D 2.5  Factor - D 2.3: User Understanding of Personal Information Protection Online Aspect Start-Up Formative Established Strategic Dynamic  Personal  Information  Protection  Online  Users and stakeholders within  the public and private sectors  have no or minimal knowledge  about how personal information  is handled online, nor do they  believe that adequate measures  are in place to protect their  personal information online.  There is no or limited discussion  regarding the protection of  personal information online.  Privacy standards are not in place  to shape Internet and social  media practices.  Users and stakeholders within  the public and private sectors  may have general knowledge  about how personal information  is handled online; and may  employ good (proactive)  cybersecurity practices to protect  their personal information  online.  Discussions have begun  regarding the protection of  personal information and about  the balance between security  and privacy.  Concrete actions or privacy  policies are being developed.  A growing proportion of users  have the skills to manage their  privacy online, and protect  themselves from intrusion,  interference, or unwanted access  of information by others.  There is considerable public  debate regarding the protection  of personal information and  about the balance between  security and privacy.  Privacy policies have been  developed within the public and  private sectors.  All stakeholders have the  information, confidence and the  ability to take steps to protect  their personal information online  and to maintain control of the  distribution of this information.  Users and stakeholders within  the public and private sectors  widely recognise the importance  of protection of personal  information online and are aware  of their privacy rights.  Mechanisms are in place in  private and public sectors to  shape Internet and social media  practices and ensure that privacy  and security do not compete.  Users have the knowledge and  skills necessary to protect their  personal information online,  adapting their abilities to the  changing risk environment.  Policies in private and public  sectors are proactively reviewed  to ensure privacy and security  do not compete in a changing  environment and are informed  by user feedback and public  debate.  New mechanisms are in place,  such as privacy by default, as  tools for transparency and are  promoted.  26 Cybersecurity Capacity Maturity Model for Nations (CMM) - 2021 Edition  D3  D1  D4  D2  D5  D 2.1  D 2.2  D 2.3  D 2.4  D 2.5  Factor - D 2.4: Reporting Mechanisms Aspect Start-Up Formative Established Strategic Dynamic  Reporting  Mechanisms  There are no official reporting  mechanisms available, but  discussions might have begun.  Users do not use social media  channels to raise concerns over  any cyber harms and problems.  No metrics of reported incidents  exist.  The public and/or private sectors  are providing some channels  for reporting cyber harms (such  as online fraud, cyber-bullying,  child abuse online, identity theft,  privacy and security breaches,  and other incidents), but these  channels are not co-ordinated  and are used in an ad-hoc  manner.  Internet users use social media  channels to inform other users in  an ad-hoc manner.  Metrics of reported incidents is  being developed.  Reporting mechanisms have been  established, promoted and are  regularly used.  Internet users widely use social  media channels to inform other  users.  There are good metrics of  reported incidents.  Co-ordinated reporting  mechanisms are widely used  and promoted within public and  private sectors.  Internet users routinely use  social media channels to inform  other users.  Cyber harm metrics have been  used to inform the revision and  promotion of new policies and  practices.  Mechanisms have been  developed to co-ordinate  response to reported incidents  between law enforcement and  the national incident response  capability.  Internet users habitually use  social media channels to inform  other users and share good  practice.  Metrics are routinely used to  inform policy and decision- makers.  27 Cybersecurity Capacity Maturity Model for Nations (CMM) - 2021 Edition  D3  D1  D4  D2  D5  D 2.1  D 2.2  D 2.3  D 2.4  D 2.5  Factor - D 2.5: Media and Online Platforms  Aspect Start-Up Formative Established Strategic Dynamic  Media and  Social Media  Mass media rarely, if ever, cover  information about cybersecurity  or report on issues such as  security breaches or cybercrime.  There is no, or rarely any  discussion on social media about  cybersecurity.  Any portrayal of whistleblowers  is negative, and based on  criminal or other negative  stereotypes.  It is perceived that there is  ad-hoc mass media coverage  of cybersecurity, with limited  information provided and  reporting on specific issues that  individuals face online, such as  protection for children online, or  cyber-bullying.  It is perceived that there is  limited discussion on social  media about cybersecurity.  There have been positive  examples of cases where  whistleblowers have had a  constructive impact.  It is perceived that cybersecurity  is a common subject across  mainstream media, and  information and reports on a wide  range of issues, including security  breaches and cybercrime, are  widely disseminated.  There is broad discussion on social  media about cybersecurity.  There is acceptance that  whistleblowers can play a positive  role.  It is perceived that mass media  coverage extends beyond  threat reporting and can inform  the public about proactive  and actionable cybersecurity  measures, as well economic and  social impacts.  There is frequent discussion on  social media about cybersecurity  and individuals regularly use  social media to share online  experiences.  Transparency is encouraged as  are whistleblowers.  It is perceived that the  broad discussion of personal  experiences and personal  attitudes of individuals across  mainstream and social media  inform policy making and  facilitate societal change.  Social media has become a  major component in tracking and  addressing cyber harms.  Whistleblowing has been  encouraged and protected as a  means of social accountability.  28 Cybersecurity Capacity Maturity Model for Nations (CMM) - 2021 Edition  D3  D1  D4  D2  D5  D 3.1  D 3.2  D 3.3  D 3.4  Dimension 3: Building Cybersecurity  Knowledge and Capabilities This Dimension reviews the availability, quality and uptake of  programmes for various groups of stakeholders, including the  government, private sector and the population as a whole,  and relate to cybersecurity awareness-raising programmes,  formal cybersecurity educational programmes, and professional  training programmes.

The need for awareness of  cybersecurity threats and  vulnerabilities in the government  is not recognised or is only at  initial stages of discussion.  A co-ordinated cybersecurity  awareness raising programme  with the involvement of  the government is under  development, with relevant  stakeholders involved, including  the private sector and civil society.  Awareness-raising programmes,  courses, seminars and online  resources initiated by the  government are available but  not sufficiently reflected in the  national cybersecurity strategy or  is in development.  The actions within the  programmes are led by different  ‘owners’ but they are not yet co- ordinated.  The availability of adequate  resources has not yet been  confirmed.  Initial system of mechanisms and  metrics to review processes are  limited or ad hoc.  A co-ordinated national  cybersecurity awareness- raising programme with  detailed implementation plan  is published. The content  includes explicit links to national  cybersecurity strategy.  A co-ordinating body has been  assigned with sufficient authority  and resources required to deliver  the actions of the national  programme.  A national cybersecurity  awareness portal exists  to improve the skills and  knowledge of the society  and is disseminated via that  programme.  Programme review processes  and outcome-oriented metrics  are in place, are adequately  funded and allow effectiveness  to be measured.  The national awareness-raising  programme is fully integrated  with sector-specific, tailored  awareness-raising programmes,  such as those focusing on  industry, academia, civil society,  and/or women and children.  Emerging cybersecurity risks  are regularly assessed and  used to update the national  cybersecurity awareness-raising  programme.  There is evidence of these  metrics being used to refine  actions within the national  awareness-raising programme  and national cybersecurity  strategy.  The national cybersecurity  awareness-raising programme  with private and civil society  stakeholders is proactively  reviewed to take account of  broader strategic developments  within the country (political,  economic, social, technical, legal  and environmental).  The country is actively involved  in creating new regional/ international cybersecurity  awareness-raising programmes  that contribute toward  expanding and enhancing  international awareness-raising  good practices.  The national cybersecurity  awareness-raising programme  has a measurable impact on the  reduction of the overall threat  landscape.  Initiatives by  Private Sector  The need for awareness of  cybersecurity threats and  vulnerabilities in the private  sector is not recognised or is only  at initial stages of discussion.  Awareness-raising programmes,  courses, seminars and online  resources initiated by the private  sector are available but no co- ordination or scaling efforts have  been conducted.  Initial system of mechanisms and  metrics to review processes are  limited or ad hoc.  Collaborative awareness-raising  efforts (e.g.: joint policy and/or  advocacy work) with government  and civil society stakeholders  are made in order to pool  resources, information and  identify solutions for cyber safety  practices.  The role of specific ‘owners’  assigned to actions within private  sector initiatives are clear and  mechanisms are in place to  enable co-ordination between  the levels of government, private  sector and civil society.  Programme review processes  and outcome-oriented metrics  are in place, well-funded and  shared with government and civil  society stakeholders.  The effectiveness of joint  awareness-raising efforts with  government and civil society  stakeholders is regularly  assessed and used to enhance  collaborative processes.  Private sector initiatives are  fully integrated into the national  awareness-raising programme.  Evidence from the lessons learnt  is fed into the development of  future programmes.  The joint awareness-raising  efforts with government and  civil society stakeholders are  proactively reviewed to take  account of broader strategic  developments within the  country (political, economic,  social, technical, legal and  environmental).  The joint awareness-raising  efforts with government and  civil society stakeholders have a  measurable impact on reduction  of the overall threat landscape.  32 Cybersecurity Capacity Maturity Model for Nations (CMM) - 2021 Edition  D3  D1  D4  D2  D5  D 3.1  D 3.2  D 3.3  D 3.4  Factor - D 3.1: Building Cybersecurity Awareness  Aspect Start-Up Formative Established Strategic Dynamic  Initiatives by  Civil Society  The need for awareness of  cybersecurity threats and  vulnerabilities in civil society is  not recognised or is only at initial  stages of discussion.  There are indications that civil  society realises that it can play  a role in awareness-raising  programmes, courses, seminars  and online resources, but no real  deliverables are yet evident.  Initial system of metrics may  exist.  Collaborative awareness-raising  efforts (e.g.: joint policy and/or  advocacy work) with government  and private sector stakeholders  are taking place in order to pool  resources and information and  identify solutions for cyber safety  practices.  The role of specific ‘owners’  assigned to actions within civil  society initiatives are clear and  mechanisms are in place to  enable co-ordination between  the levels of government, private  sector and civil society.  Programme review processes  and outcome-oriented metrics  are in place, well-funded and  shared with government and  private sector stakeholders.  The effectiveness of joint  awareness-raising efforts  with government and private  sector stakeholders is regularly  assessed and used to enhance  collaborative processes.  Civil society initiatives are fully  integrated into the national  awareness-raising programme.  Evidence from the lessons learnt  is fed into the development of  future programmes.  The joint awareness-raising  efforts with government and  private sector stakeholders are  proactively reviewed to take  account of broader strategic  developments within the  country (political, economic,  social, technical, legal and  environmental).  The joint awareness-raising  efforts with government and  private sector have a measurable  impact on reduction of the  overall threat landscape.  Executive  Awareness  Raising  Awareness raising on  cybersecurity issues for  executives is limited or non- existent.  Executives are not yet aware  of their responsibilities to  shareholders, clients, customers,  and employees in relation to  cybersecurity.  Executives are made aware of  general cybersecurity issues, but  not how these issues and threats  might affect their organisations.  Executives of particular  sectors, such as finance and  telecommunications, have been  made aware of cybersecurity  risks in general, and how  the organisation deals with  cybersecurity issues, but not of  strategic implications.  Awareness raising of executives  in the public, private, academic  and civil society sectors address  cybersecurity risks in general,  some of the primary methods of  attack, and how the organisation  deals with cyber issues (usually  abdicated to the CIO*).  Select executive members  are made aware of how  cybersecurity risks affect the  strategic decision making of  the organisation, particularly  those in the financial and  telecommunications sectors.  Awareness-raising efforts of  cybersecurity crisis management  at the executive level is still  reactive in focus.  Executive awareness-raising  efforts in nearly all sectors  include the identification  of strategic assets, specific  measures in place to protect  them, and the mechanism by  which they are protected.  Executives are able to alter  strategic decision making and  allocate specific funding and  people to the various elements  of cyber risk, contingent on their  company’s prevailing situation.  Executives are made aware of  what contingency plans are  in place to address various  cyber-based attacks and their  aftermath.  Executive awareness courses in  cybersecurity are mandatory for  nearly all sectors.  Cybersecurity risks are  considered as an agenda item  at every executive meeting,  and funding and attention is  reallocated to address those  risks.  Executives at regional and  international level are regarded  as a source of good practice in  responsible and accountable  corporate cybersecurity  governance.  * Chief Information Officer  33 Cybersecurity Capacity Maturity Model for Nations (CMM) - 2021 Edition  D3  D1  D4  D2  D5  D 3.1  D 3.2  D 3.3  D 3.4  Factor - D 3.2: Cybersecurity Education Aspect Start-Up Formative Established Strategic Dynamic  Provision  Few or no cybersecurity  educators are available, and  there are no qualification  programmes for educators.  Computer science courses  are offered that may have a  security component, but no  cybersecurity-related courses are  offered.  No accreditation in cybersecurity  education exists.  Qualification programmes for  cybersecurity educators are  being explored, with a small  cadre of existing qualified  educators.  Some educational courses exist in  cybersecurity-related fields, such  as information security, network  security and cryptography, but  cybersecurity-specific courses are  not yet offered.  A demand for cybersecurity  education is evidenced through  course enrolment and feedback.  Qualifications for and supply of  educators are readily available in  cybersecurity.  Specialised courses in  cybersecurity are offered and  accredited at university level.  Cybersecurity risk-awareness  modules are offered as part of  many university courses.  Degrees in cybersecurity-related  fields are offered by universities  or equivalent educational  institutions.  Universities and other bodies  hold seminars/lectures on  cybersecurity issues, aimed at  non-specialists.  Research and development  are leading considerations in  cybersecurity education.  Cybersecurity education is  not limited to universities  or equivalent educational  institutions, but ranges from  primary, secondary and tertiary  to post-graduate levels, including  vocational education.  Steps might have been taken  to incorporate STEM* or  equivalent education framework  with a focus on cybersecurity  throughout primary and  secondary curricula.  Cybersecurity educators are not  only drawn from the academic  environment, but incentives are  in place so that industry and/or  government experts take these  positions as well.  Accredited cybersecurity courses  are embedded in all computer  science degrees.  Degrees are specifically offered  in cybersecurity, and encompass  courses and models in various  other cybersecurity-related  fields, including technical and  non-technical elements such as  policy implications, and multi- disciplinary education.  Cybersecurity educational  offerings are weighted and  focused on an understanding  of current risks and skills  requirements. The content of  cybersecurity courses covers  topics on emerging threats in  cybersecurity.  National or international  cybersecurity frameworks and/ or curricular guidelines are taken  into consideration by academic  institutions when designing  cybersecurity courses.  Apprenticeship programmes in  different industry sectors are  offered to combine knowledge  and practical skills.  National courses, degrees, and  research are at the forefront of  cybersecurity education.  Cybersecurity education  programmes maintain a balance  between preserving core  components of the curriculum  and promoting adaptive  processes that respond to rapid  changes in the cybersecurity  environment.  Prevailing cybersecurity  requirements are considered in  the redevelopment of all general  curricula.  * Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics  34 Cybersecurity Capacity Maturity Model for Nations (CMM) - 2021 Edition  D3  D1  D4  D2  D5  D 3.1  D 3.2  D 3.3  D 3.4  Factor - D 3.2: Cybersecurity Education Aspect Start-Up Formative Established Strategic Dynamic  Administration  The need to enhance national  cybersecurity education is not  yet considered.  A network of national contact  points for governmental,  regulatory bodies, critical  industries and education  institutions is not yet established.  Discussion of how co-ordinated  management of cybersecurity  education and research enhances  national knowledge development  has not or has only just begun.  The need to enhance  cybersecurity education  in schools and universities  or equivalent educational  institutions has been identified  by leading government, industry,  and academic stakeholders.  Schools, government and  industry collaborate in an  ad-hoc manner to supply the  resources necessary for providing  cybersecurity education.  A national budget focused on  cybersecurity education is not  yet established.  Initial system of mechanisms  and metrics to review the supply  and demand for cybersecurity  courses are limited or ad hoc.  Broad consultation across  government, private sector,  academia and civil society  stakeholders informs  cybersecurity education priorities  and is reflected in national  cybersecurity strategy.  National budget is dedicated to  national cybersecurity research  and laboratories at universities  or equivalent educational  institutions.  Competitions, initiatives and  funding schemes for students  and employees are promoted  by government and/or industry  in order to increase the  attractiveness of cybersecurity  careers.  Programme review processes  and outcome-oriented metrics to  review the supply and demand  for cybersecurity courses are in  place and well-funded.  Metrics are being used to refine  actions within educational  investment to create a cadre  of cybersecurity experts in the  country across, all sectors.  Management of the government  budget and spending on  cybersecurity education is based  on national demand.  Leading national cybersecurity  academic institutions share  lessons learnt with other national  and international counterparts.  Government has established  academic centres of excellence in  cybersecurity.  International cybersecurity  centres of excellence are  established through twinning  programmes led by world-class  institutions.  Co-operation between all  stakeholders in cybersecurity  education is routine and can be  proven.  Content in cybersecurity  education programmes is aligned  with practical cybersecurity  problems and business  challenges and provides a  mechanism for enhancing  curricula based on the evolving  landscape.  35 Cybersecurity Capacity Maturity Model for Nations (CMM) - 2021 Edition  D3  D1  D4  D2  D5  D 3.1  D 3.2  D 3.3  D 3.4  Factor - D 3.3: Cybersecurity Professional Training Aspect Start-Up Formative Established Strategic Dynamic  Provision  Few or no training  programmes in cybersecurity  exist.  The need for training  professionals in cybersecurity has  been documented at the national  level.  Training for general IT staff is  provided on cybersecurity issues  so that they can react to incidents  as they occur, but no training for  dedicated security professionals  exists.  ICT* professional certification  is offered, with some security  modules or components.  Best practice training and  certifications might be accessible  via international online sources  (e.g.: CISSP**).  Ad-hoc training courses, seminars  and online resources are available  for cybersecurity professionals  through public or private sources,  with limited evidence of take-up.  Structured cybersecurity training  programmes exist to develop skills  towards building a cadre of cybersecurity- specific professionals.  National or international cybersecurity  vocational-based frameworks and  international best practices are taken  into consideration when designing  professional training courses.  Security professional certification is  offered across sectors within the country.  The needs of society are well understood,  and a list of training requirements is  documented.  Training programmes for non- cybersecurity professionals are recognised  and offered.  Government initiatives to stay in the  country after the successful completion of  cybersecurity training programmes might  be in place.  A range of cybersecurity training  courses is tailored towards  meeting national strategic  demand and aligns with  international good practice.  The training programmes outline  the priorities in the national  cybersecurity strategy.  Training programmes are offered  to cybersecurity professionals  and focus on the skills necessary  to communicate technically  complex challenges to non- technical audiences, such as  management and general  employees.  Outcome-oriented metrics drawn  from comprehensive supply-and- demand data for cybersecurity  professionals are being used to  inform the modes, sustainability  and procedures of future training  programmes.  The public and private sector  collaborate to offer training,  and constantly adapt and seek  to build skillsets drawn from  both sectors.  Training offerings and  education programmes are  co-ordinated so that the  foundation established in  schools can enable training  programmes to build a highly  skilled workforce.  Programmes and incentive  structures are in place to  ensure the retention of the  trained workforce within the  country.  Uptake  Training uptake by IT  personnel designated to  respond to cybersecurity  incidents is limited or non- existent.  There is no transfer of  knowledge from employees  trained in cybersecurity to  untrained employees.  Metrics that evaluate the take- up of ad-hoc training courses,  seminars, online resources,  and certification offerings are  limited in scope or ad hoc.  The transfer of knowledge  from employees trained in  cybersecurity to untrained  employees in both the public and  private sectors is ad hoc.  There is an established cadre of certified  employees trained in cybersecurity  issues, processes, planning and analytics.  A national register of successful and  certified students and professionals might  exist.  The transfer of knowledge from  employees trained in cybersecurity to  untrained employees in both public and  private sectors is established.  Job creation initiatives for cybersecurity  within organisations are established and  encourage employers to train staff to  become cybersecurity professionals.  Programme review processes and  metrics are in place to allow progress to  be measured and assess the supply and  demand for cybersecurity-skilled workers  in both public and private environments.  These processes are adequately funded.  The uptake of cybersecurity  training is used to inform future  training programmes.  Co-ordination of training across  all sectors ensures the national  demand for professionals is met.  Cybersecurity professionals  not only fulfil national  requirements, but domestic  professionals overseas are  consulted to share lessons  learnt and best practice.  * Information and Communications Technology  ** Certified Information Systems Security Professional  36 Cybersecurity Capacity Maturity Model for Nations (CMM) - 2021 Edition  D3  D1  D4  D2  D5  D 3.1  D 3.2  D 3.3  D 3.4  Factor - D 3.4: Cybersecurity Research and Innovation Aspect Start-Up Formative Established Strategic Dynamic  Research and  Development  There are limited or no  cybersecurity research and  development (R&D) activities  occurring in the country.

General criminal law may exist,  but its application to cybercrime  is unclear.  Partial legislation exists that  addresses some aspects of  cybercrime, or cybercrime legal  provisions are in development.  Substantive cybercrime legal  provisions are contained in specific  legislation or a general criminal  law.  The country may have ratified  regional or international  instruments on cybercrime. The  country consistently seeks to  implement these measures into  domestic law.  Measures are in place to exceed  minimal baselines specified in  international treaties, where  appropriate.  The country seeks to adapt  its substantive cybercrime  legislation to take account of  emerging technologies and their  use.  Substantive cybercrime law  is constructed so that it can  cater for dynamic changes in  the underlying technology and  threat environment, without the  need for substantial and lengthy  revision.  The country is actively  contributing to the international  promotion of effective  cybercrime legislation.  Legal and  Regulatory  Requirements  for  Cybersecurity  There are limited cybersecurity  requirements set out in  regulation or law.  The need to create legal and  regulatory frameworks on  cybersecurity may have been  recognised and may have  resulted in a gap analysis.  Stakeholders from relevant  sectors have been consulted to  support the establishment of  legal and regulatory frameworks.  Draft legislation and regulation  may be in place, but this has yet  to be adopted and may not cover  all relevant sectors.  Comprehensive cybersecurity  requirements are set out in  relevant regulation and law  (including sector-specific  requirements, where relevant).  These requirements may include  mandatory standards, or breach  notification requirements  and vulnerability disclosure  requirements.  Relevant civil and criminal  liabilities are clearly articulated  and understood by regulated  entities.  Relevant legal and regulatory  bodies have the powers needed  to enforce these requirements.  The effectiveness of law  and regulation in improving  cybersecurity practice is regularly  assessed and used to inform  their future development.  Regulations are updated to  take account of emerging  technologies.  Regulatory frameworks are  sufficiently flexible to cater for  rapidly emerging changes in  the underlying technological or  threat environment.  The country is promoting best  practice legal and regulatory  approaches internationally.  The country is actively involved in  the development of international  agreements to promote  harmonisation and mutual  recognition of cybersecurity laws  and regulations.  41 Cybersecurity Capacity Maturity Model for Nations (CMM) - 2021 Edition  D3  D1  D4  D2  D5  D 4.1  D 4.2  D 4.3  D 4.4  Factor - D 4.1: Legal and Regulatory Provisions Aspect Start-Up Formative Established Strategic Dynamic  Procedural  Cybercrime  Legislation  Specific procedural criminal  law for cybercrime does not  exist. It is not clear how general  criminal procedural law applies  to cybercrime investigations,  prosecutions, and electronic  evidence.  Development of specific  procedural cybercrime  legislation, or amendment of  general procedural criminal law  to adapt to cybercrime cases, has  begun.  Comprehensive criminal  procedural law containing  provisions on the investigation  of cybercrime and evidentiary  requirements has been adopted  and is applied.  The country may have ratified  regional or international  instruments on cybercrime. The  country consistently seeks to  implement these measures into  domestic law.  Procedural laws relating to  cybercrime permit the exchange  of information (and other actions  required) to support successful  cross-border investigation of  cybercrime.  Measures are in place to exceed  minimal baselines specified in  international treaties, where  appropriate.  The country seeks to adapt  procedural cybercrime  legislations to take account of  emerging technologies and their  use.  Procedural cybercrime law is  constructed in a way that it can  cater for dynamic changes in  the underlying technology and  threat environment, without the  need for substantial and lengthy  revision.  The country is actively  contributing to the promotion of  effective procedural cybercrime  legislation and instruments to  improve international cybercrime  investigations.  Human  Rights Impact  Assessment  Substantive and procedural  cybercrime legislation and  cybersecurity regulations may be  in development, but no human  rights impact assessments have  been carried out.  Human rights impact  assessments of substantive and  procedural cybercrime legislation  and cybersecurity regulations  may have been conducted,  including consideration of privacy  and freedom of expression  implications. Some issues,  however, have yet to be resolved.  Relevant human rights experts  have been consulted in the  development of the legislation  and regulation.  Full human rights impact  assessments of substantive and  procedural cybercrime legislation  and cybersecurity regulations  have been completed and  international standards are met.  Implementation of this legislation  is monitored on a regular basis  for human rights compliance, and  this is independently verified.  Human rights impact  assessments are regularly  reviewed to ensure that practice  remains compatible with human  rights requirements, and that the  effect of emerging technologies  is considered.  Consideration has also been  given to how cybersecurity  can enhance human rights  protection within the country  and internationally.  The country is actively  contributing to the development  and promotion of human rights  impact assessments as they  relate to cybersecurity.  42 Cybersecurity Capacity Maturity Model for Nations (CMM) - 2021 Edition  D3  D1  D4  D2  D5  D 4.1  D 4.2  D 4.3  D 4.4  Factor - D 4.2: Related Legislative Frameworks Aspect Start-Up Formative Established Strategic Dynamic  Data  Protection  Legislation  Data protection legislation does  not exist.

Traditional investigative  measures are applied to  cybercrime investigations, but  digital investigation capacity is  limited.  Law enforcement officers may  receive training on cybercrime  and digital evidence, but it is ad  hoc.  A comprehensive institutional  capacity with sufficient human,  procedural and technological  resources to investigate  cybercrime cases has been  established.  Digital chain of custody and  evidence integrity is established,  including formal processes, roles  and responsibilities.  Standards for the training of  law enforcement officers on  cybercrime and digital evidence  exist and are implemented.  The respective roles of national  and state/local law enforcement  agencies are understood and  state-/local-level forces are  equipped to undertake their role.  Quantified risk assessments are  used to allocate resources to  operational cybercrime units (at  national and state/local levels).  Trends and statistics on  cybercrime, law enforcement  interventions and their impact  on harm reduction are collected,  analysed and used to inform  strategy and long-term resource  allocation decision.  Law enforcement strategies  include crime prevention  measures alongside enforcement  measures. Intelligence is used to  support proactive investigation.  Law enforcement agencies have  the capabilities to maintain  the integrity of data to meet  international evidential standards  in cross-border investigation.  The country is actively involved in  the development of collaborative  platforms between national law  enforcement authorities.  The law enforcement agencies  within the country are at the  forefront of developing new  capabilities and approaches for  the prevention and disruption of  cybercrime and promoting their  use internationally.  Prosecution  Prosecutors do not receive  adequate training and resources  to review electronic evidence or  prosecute cybercrime.  Consultation may have begun  to consider this capacity in the  prosecutor community.  A limited number of prosecutors  have the capacity to conduct  cybercrime cases and to handle  electronic evidence, but this  capacity is largely ad hoc and is  not institutionalised.  If prosecutors receive training on  cybercrime and digital evidence,  it is ad hoc.  A comprehensive institutional  capacity, including sufficient  human and technological  resources, to prosecute  cybercrime cases and cases  involving electronic evidence is  established.  A specialist cadre of cybercrime  prosecutors may have been  established.  Institutional structures are in  place, with a clear distribution of  tasks and obligations within the  prosecution services at all levels  of the state.  A mechanism exists that enables  the exchange of information  and good practices between  prosecutors and judges to  ensure efficient and effective  prosecution of cybercrime cases.  There is national capacity to  prosecute complex domestic and  cross-border cybercrime cases.  45 Cybersecurity Capacity Maturity Model for Nations (CMM) - 2021 Edition  D3  D1  D4  D2  D5  D 4.1  D 4.2  D 4.3  D 4.4  Factor - D 4.3: Legal and Regulatory Capability and Capacity Aspect Start-Up Formative Established Strategic Dynamic  Courts  There is no process to equip  judges so they can preside  over cybercrime cases or cases  involving electronic evidence.  Consultation may have begun  to consider this capacity in the  judicial community.  A limited number of judges  have the capacity to preside  over a cybercrime case, but this  capacity is largely ad hoc.  If judges receive training on  cybercrime and digital evidence,  it is ad hoc.  Sufficient human and  technological resources are  available to ensure effective  and efficient legal proceedings  regarding cybercrime cases  and cases involving electronic  evidence.  Judges receive specialised  training about cybercrime and  electronic evidence.  States/local courts are equipped  to deal with cybercrime cases,  appropriate to their level.  Relevant courts are equipped to  process civil litigation relating to  cybersecurity liability.  The institutional capacity of  the court system to conduct  cybercrime cases is frequently  reviewed and revised based on  an assessment of effectiveness.  The country is actively involved  in developing and promoting  best practices in the conduct of  cybercrime cases.  Regulatory  Bodies  Sector-specific regulators have  limited understanding of the  potential impact of cyber on  their regulated entities.  There is no cross-sector  regulatory body to supervise  specific cybersecurity  requirements.  Sector-specific regulators  have started to establish their  cybersecurity roles.  A requirement for the  establishment of cross-sector  regulatory bodies to oversee  compliance with specific  cybersecurity regulations may  have been considered.  Relevant stakeholders have been  consulted in this process.  Sector-specific regulators (e.g.:  finance, energy, transport) are  equipped with the capability and  resources required to oversee  compliance with cybersecurity  requirements within their sector.  Where cross-sector regulatory  bodies have been established to  oversee cybersecurity, they have  the necessary capability and  resources to undertake their role.  The impact of regulatory actions  on organisations’ cybersecurity  practices are regularly assessed  and used to inform supervisory  activity and regulation  development.  Regulatory bodies regularly  assess emerging technologies  and their potential impact on  the cybersecurity of regulated  entities.  Regulatory interventions and  investigations are informed by,  and prioritised on the basis of,  national assessments of cyber  risk.  Regulatory bodies are actively  involved in the development and  promotion of regulatory best  practice internationally.  46 Cybersecurity Capacity Maturity Model for Nations (CMM) - 2021 Edition  D3  D1  D4  D2  D5  D 4.1  D 4.2  D 4.3  D 4.4  Factor - D 4.4: Formal and Informal Co-operation Frameworks to Combat Cybercrime Aspect Start-Up Formative Established Strategic Dynamic  Law  Enforcement  Co-operation  with Private  Sector  Co-operation between domestic  public and private sectors on  cybercrime is limited.  Specifically, co-operation  between Internet service and  other technology providers and  law enforcement has not been  established.  Exchange of information on  cybercrime between domestic  public and private sectors is ad  hoc and unregulated.  Specifically, ad-hoc co-operation  between Internet service and  other technology providers and  law enforcement exists but is not  always effective.  Information is regularly  exchanged between domestic  public and private sectors and  is supported by appropriate  legislation.  Effective co-operation  mechanisms between Internet  service and other technology  providers and law enforcement  have been established as  part of these broader public– private sector collaboration  arrangements.  The effectiveness of public and  private co-operation is regularly  assessed and used to enhance  collaborative processes.  Collaboration frameworks  are regularly adapted to take  account of new technologies and  emerging forms of cybercrime.  The country is actively  contributing to the promotion of  public–private partnership and  the development of international  public–private partnership  platforms.  Co-operation  with  Foreign Law  Enforcement  Counterparts  There are minimal or no forms  of international co-operation to  prevent and combat cybercrime.  Formal mechanisms of  international law enforcement  co-operation may exist, but their  application to cybercrime is ad  hoc or only possible in some  cases.  Law enforcement is not formally  integrated into regional and  international cybercrime  networks.  Formal mechanisms of  international law enforcement  co-operation have been  established to facilitate the  detection, investigation, and  prosecution of cybercrime.  Mutual legal assistance,  extradition agreements and  mechanisms have been  established and are applied to  cybercrime cases.  Domestic law enforcement  agencies are integrated with  regional and international  networks, such as Interpol or  24/7 networks.  Law enforcement agencies work  jointly with foreign counterparts,  potentially through joint task  forces, resulting in successful  cross-border cybercrime  investigations and prosecutions.  The country actively contributes  to the promotion and  development of international  co-operation mechanisms.  Government- Criminal  Justice Sector  Collaboration  There is minimal interaction  between government and  criminal justice actors.  Exchange of information  between government and  criminal justice actors is limited  and ad hoc.  Formal relationships between  government and criminal justice  actors have been established,  resulting in the regular exchange  of information on cybercrime  issues.  The relationship between  government actors, prosecutors,  judges and law enforcement  agencies is regularly assessed  and used to enhance their  effectiveness.  The country actively contributes  to the international promotion  of efficient and timely exchange  of information between  government and criminal justice  actors.  47 Cybersecurity Capacity Maturity Model for Nations (CMM) - 2021 Edition  D3  D1  D4  D2  D5  D 5.1  D 5.2  D 5.3  D 5.4  D 5.5  D 5.6  Dimension 5: Standards  and Technologies  This Dimension addresses effective and widespread  use of cybersecurity technology to protect individuals,  organisations and national infrastructure.

Or initial identification of  some appropriate standards  and good practices has been  made by the public and  private sectors, and possibly  some ad-hoc implementation,  but no concerted endeavour  to implement or change  existing practice in a  measurable way.  Information risk management  standards have been identified  for use and there have been  some initial signs of promotion  and take-up within public and  private sectors.  There is some evidence of  measurable implementation  and use of international  standards and good practices.  A nationally-agreed baseline of  cybersecurity-related standards  and good practices have been  identified and implemented  widely across public and private  sectors.  An entity within government  exists to assess the use of  standards across public and  private sectors.  Government schemes exist  to promote continued  enhancements, and metrics  are being applied to monitor  compliance.  Consideration is being given as to  how standards and best practices  can be used to address risk  within supply chains within the  CI, by both government and CI.  Government and organisations  promote use of standards and best  practices according to assessment of  national risks and budgetary choices.  The choice of standards and best  practices and their implementation is  continuously revised.  Emerging cybersecurity risks are  regularly assessed and used to re- evaluate the need for additional ICT  security standards.  There is evidence of debate between  government and other stakeholders  as to how national and organisational  resource decisions should align and  drive implementation of standards.  Evidence of contribution to  international standards’ bodies  exists and contributes to thought  leadership and sharing of experience  by organisations.  The country is actively involved  in the development and  promotion of defined standards  internationally.  Implementation of standards and  non-compliance decisions are  made in response to changing  threat environments and  resource drivers across sectors  and CI, through collaborative risk  management.  Evidence exists of debate within  all sectors on compliance to  standards and best practices,  based on continuous needs  assessments.  51 Cybersecurity Capacity Maturity Model for Nations (CMM) - 2021 Edition  D3  D1  D4  D2  D5  D 5.1  D 5.2  D 5.3  D 5.4  D 5.5  D 5.6  Factor - D 5.1: Adherence to Standards Aspect Start-Up Formative Established Strategic Dynamic  Standards in  Procurement  No standards or best practices  have been identified for  use in guiding procurement  processes by the public and  private sectors. If they are  recognised, implementation  is ad hoc and un-co-ordinated.  Cybersecurity standards  and best practices guiding  procurement processes  (including risk management,  lifecycle management, software  and hardware assurance,  outsourcing, and use of cloud  services) have been identified  for use.  Evidence of promotion  and implementation of  cybersecurity standards and  best practices in defining  procurement practices exists  within public and private  sectors.  Cybersecurity standards and  best practices in guiding  procurement processes (including  risk management, lifecycle  management, software and  hardware assurance, outsourcing,  and use of cloud services) are  being adhered to widely within  public and private sectors.  Implementation and compliance  of standards in procurement  practices within the public and  private sectors is evidenced  through measurement and  assessments of process  effectiveness.  Organisations have the ability to  monitor and change use of standards  and best practices in procurement  processes, support deviations and  non-compliance decisions as the need  arises through risk-based decision- making.  Emerging cybersecurity risks are  regularly assessed and used to  re-evaluate the need for additional  standards in procurement.  Critical aspects of procurement  and supply, such as total lifecycle  cost, quality, inter-operability,  maintenance, support and other value- adding activities, are continuously  improved, and procurement process  improvements are made in the context  of wider resource planning.  Organisations are able to benchmark  the skills of their procurement  professionals against the competencies  outlined in procurement standards and  identify any skills and capability gaps.  The country is actively involved  in the development and  promotion of these standards  internationally.  Implementation of standards in  procurement processes and non- compliance decisions are made  in response to changing threat  environments.  Standards for  Provision of  Products and  Services  Either no standards or  best practices have been  identified for use in securing  the products and services  (in particular, software,  hardware, managed services  and cloud services) developed  or offered by providers in the  country.  Or there is some  identification, but only limited  evidence of take-up.  Core activities and  methodologies for secure  development and lifecycle  management for software,  hardware and provision of  managed services and cloud  services are being identified and  discussed within professional  communities.  Government promotes  relevant standards in software  development, hardware  quality assurance, provision  of managed services and  cloud security but there is  no evidence of widespread  adoption of these standards yet.  There is evidence of widespread  implementation of standards  in the software development  processes, hardware quality  assurance, provision of managed  services and cloud services  by public and private sector  organisations.  Government has an established  programme for promoting and  monitoring standard adoption  in software development,  hardware quality assurance and  cloud security, for public and  commercial systems.  Evidence that high integrity  systems and software  development techniques are  present within the educational  and training offerings in the  country.  Security considerations are  incorporated in all stages of the  development of software, hardware  and provision of managed services  and cloud services.  Core development activities,  including configuration and  documentation management,  security development and lifecycle  planning have been adopted into  the practices of product and service  providers  Projects on software development,  hardware quality assurance,  managed service and cloud security  continuously assess the value of  standards and reduce or enhance  levels of compliance according to  risk-based decisions.  The country is actively involved  in the development and  promotion of these standards  internationally.  Implementation of these  standards and non-compliance  decisions are made in response  to changing threat environments.  52 Cybersecurity Capacity Maturity Model for Nations (CMM) - 2021 Edition  D3  D1  D4  D2  D5  D 5.1  D 5.2  D 5.3  D 5.4  D 5.5  D 5.6  Factor - D 5.2: Security Controls Aspect Start-Up Formative Established Strategic Dynamic  Technological  Security  Controls  There is minimal or no  understanding or deployment  of the technological security  controls available in the  marketplace, by users and public  and private sectors.  Internet service and other  technology providers may not  offer any upstream controls to  their customers.  Technological security controls  are deployed by users and  public and private sectors, but  possibly not consistently across  all sectors.  The deployment of up-to-date  technological security controls  is promoted in an ad-hoc  manner and all sectors are being  incentivised to make use of  them.  Internet service and other  technology providers may be  offering security services as part  of their services but possibly in  an ad-hoc manner.  Internet service and other  technology providers recognise a  need to establish internal policies  for the deployment of technical  security controls, to manage  identified risks in the products  and services they are offering.  Up-to-date technological security  controls, including patching and  backups, are deployed in all  sectors.  Physical security controls are  used to prevent unauthorised  personnel from entering  computing facilities in all sectors.  Internet service and other  technology providers establish  internal policies for the  deployment of technical security  controls, to manage identified  risks in the products and services  they are offering.  The technological cybersecurity  control set reflects  internationally-established  cybersecurity frameworks,  standards and good practice.  Widespread adoption of  technological security controls  leads to effective upstream  protection of users and public  and private sectors.  All sectors have the capacity to  continuously assess the security  controls deployed, for their  effectiveness and suitability  according to their changing  needs.  The understanding of the  technological security controls  being deployed extends to  their impact on organisational  operations and budget allocation.  The public and private sectors  have the capacity to critically  assess and upgrade cybersecurity  controls according to their  appropriateness and suitability  for use, and considering  emerging risks.  There is widespread adoption of  multi-factor authentication for  online services and privileged  accounts. Certificate Authorities  are available and digital  certificates are widely used.  Internet service and other  technology providers have  the ability to prevent access  to non-trusted sites or web  addresses in accordance with the  requirements of the appropriate  regulator.  The application of advanced  technological controls within the  country is a leading influence  internationally.  Implementation of advanced  technological security controls  are made in response to  changing threat environments.  53 Cybersecurity Capacity Maturity Model for Nations (CMM) - 2021 Edition  D3  D1  D4  D2  D5  D 5.1  D 5.2  D 5.3  D 5.4  D 5.5  D 5.6  Factor - D 5.2: Security Controls Aspect Start-Up Formative Established Strategic Dynamic  Cryptographic  Controls  Cryptographic techniques (e.g.:  encryption and digital signatures)  for protection of data at rest and  data in transit may be a concern  but are not yet deployed within  the government or private sector,  or by the general public.  Cryptographic controls for  protecting data at rest and  in transit are recognised and  deployed ad hoc by multiple  stakeholders and within various  sectors.  Tools, such as TLS*, are deployed  ad hoc by service providers  to secure all communications  between servers and users.  Cryptographic techniques are  available for all sectors and users  for the protection of data at rest  or in transit.  There is a broad understanding  of secure communication  services, such as encrypted or  signed email.  The cryptographic controls  deployed meet international  standards and guidelines for each  sector and are kept up to date.  Tools, such as TLS are routinely  deployed by service providers  to secure all communications  between servers and users.  The public and private sectors  critically assess the deployment  of cryptographic controls,  according to their objectives and  priorities.  The public and private  sectors adapt encryption and  cryptographic control policies  based on the evolution of  technological advancement and  changing threat environment.  The public and private sectors  have developed encryption  and cryptographic control  policies based on the previous  assessment, and regularly review  the policies for effectiveness.  The country has considered  implementing digital-identity  management.  The country has considered  whether it requires a national  PKI**.  The country is contributing to  the international debate around  best practice on cryptographic  controls.  Implementation of cryptographic  controls are made in response to  changing threat environments.  * Transport Layer Security ** Public Key Infrastructure  54 Cybersecurity Capacity Maturity Model for Nations (CMM) - 2021 Edition  D3  D1  D4  D2  D5  D 5.1  D 5.2  D 5.3  D 5.4  D 5.5  D 5.6  Factor - D 5.3: Software Quality Aspect Start-Up Formative Established Strategic Dynamic  Software  Quality and  Assurance  Quality and performance of  software used in the country  is a concern, but functional  requirements are not yet fully  monitored.  A catalogue of assured software  platforms and applications within  the public and private sectors  does not exist.  Policies and processes regarding  updates and maintenance  (including patch management) of  software applications have not  yet been formulated.  Software quality and functional  requirements in public and  private sectors are recognised  and identified, but not  necessarily in a strategic manner.  A catalogue for assured software  platforms and applications within  the public and private sectors is  in development.  Policies and processes  on software updates and  maintenance (including patch  management) are now in  development.  Evidence of software quality  deficiencies is being gathered  and assessed regarding its impact  on usability and performance.  Software quality and functional  requirements in public and  private sectors are recognised and  established.  Reliable software applications  that adhere to international  standards and good practices are  being used widely in the public  and private sectors.  Policies on and processes  for software updates and  maintenance (including patch  management) are established in  all sectors.  Software applications are  characterised as to their reliability,  usability and performance in  adherence to international  standards and good practices.  Quality of software used in public  and private sectors is monitored  and assessed.  Policies and processes  on software updates and  maintenance (including patch  management) are being  improved, based on risk  assessments and the critical  nature of services in all sectors.  Benefits to businesses from  additional investment in  ensuring software quality and  maintenance are measured and  assessed.  Software defects are manageable  in a timely manner and service  continuity is ensured.  Software applications of high- level performance, reliability  and usability are available, with  service continuity processes fully  automated.  Requirements of software  quality are being systematically  reviewed, updated, and adapted  to the changing cybersecurity  environment.  55 Cybersecurity Capacity Maturity Model for Nations (CMM) - 2021 Edition  D3  D1  D4  D2  D5  D 5.1  D 5.2  D 5.3  D 5.4  D 5.5  D 5.6  Factor - D 5.4: Communications and Internet Infrastructure Resilience Aspect Start-Up Formative Established Strategic Dynamic  Internet  Infrastructure  Reliability  Affordable and reliable Internet  services and infrastructure in  the country may not have been  established; if they have been,  adoption rates of those services  are a concern.  There is little or no national  oversight of network  infrastructure.  If networks and systems are  outsourced, the reliability of  third-party providers may not  have been considered.  Network redundancy measures  may be considered, but not in  a systematic, comprehensive  fashion.  Limited Internet services and  infrastructure are available, but  with low levels of adoption and  issues of unreliability.  The ability of Internet  infrastructure in public and  private sectors to withstand  incidents with minimum  disruption has been discussed by  multiple stakeholders but may  not have been fully addressed.  Support for securing Internet  infrastructure may rely on  regional assistance.  Reliable Internet services are  widely available and used.  Internet services are trusted  widely for conducting  e-commerce and electronic  business transactions;  appropriate authentication  processes are established.  Technology deployed and  processes used for managing  Internet infrastructure meet  international standards and  follow good practices.  National infrastructure is  formally managed, with  documented processes, roles  and responsibilities, and limited  redundancy.  Regular assessments are made  of technology, of processes for  compliance with international  standards, and of guidelines that  address the national need in  the face of emerging risks, and  changes are made as required.  There is effective and  controlled acquisition of critical  technologies, and there are  managed strategic planning and  service continuity processes in  place.  Acquisition of infrastructure  technologies is effectively  controlled, with flexibility  incorporated according to  changing market dynamics.  Costs for infrastructure  technologies are continually  assessed and optimised.  Scientific, technical, industrial  and human capabilities are  being systematically maintained,  enhanced, and perpetuated in  order to maintain the country’s  independent resilience.  Optimised efficiency is in place  to mediate extended outages of  systems.  Monitoring  and Response  No risk assessments are  conducted by Internet  infrastructure owners to identify  vulnerable assets and prioritise  protective actions.  There is no monitoring in place  to detect that incidents have  occurred.  No incident response plans are  in place.  Processes on developing risk  assessments for Internet  infrastructure owners have been  initiated.  There is ad-hoc monitoring  of parts of the Internet  infrastructure, but it may not be  comprehensive.  Incident response plans are in  development in some sectors.  Mechanisms are in place in  both public and private sectors  to conduct risk assessments,  monitor and test network  resilience, and to respond to  incidents.  Incident response plans are in  place in both public and private  sectors and are regularly tested  and kept under review.  Appropriate resources  are allocated to hardware  integration, technology stress  testing, personnel training,  monitoring, response, and drills  to test response plans.  Risks related to emerging and  converging technologies are  regularly assessed by Internet  Infrastructure owners.  Risks related to emerging and  converging technologies are  regularly assessed by regulatory  agencies responsible for  electronic communications  networks and this is used to  inform funding and priority  decisions.  National-level assets can act  to work with the international  community in the event of a  trans-jurisdictional crisis or  incident.  Lessons learnt from international  collaborations are used to  evolve monitoring and response  capabilities.  Evidence exists that sovereign  novel monitoring and response  capabilities are being developed  in anticipation of emerging  threats.  56 Cybersecurity Capacity Maturity Model for Nations (CMM) - 2021 Edition  D3  D1  D4  D2  D5  D 5.1  D 5.2  D 5.3  D 5.4  D 5.5  D 5.6  Factor - D 5.5: Cybersecurity Marketplace Aspect Start-Up Formative Established Strategic Dynamic  Cybersecurity  Technologies  If domestic production of  cybersecurity technologies  exists, it does not follow secure  processes.  The country has not considered  the security implications of  using foreign cybersecurity  technologies.  If there is domestic production,  the need for secure processes is  recognised.  If there is reliance on foreign  technologies, the security  implications are considered.  If there is domestic production,  secure processes are in place.  If there is reliance on foreign  technologies, the security  implications are identified and  mitigated in the context of an  international supply chain.  If there is local development  of cybersecurity technology,  it abides by secure coding  guidelines, good practices and  adheres to internationally- accepted standards.  Risk assessments and  market incentives inform  the prioritisation of product  development and mitigation of  identified risks.  The security implications of  using foreign technologies are  routinely analysed and revised  based on the assessment of  emerging cybersecurity risks.  Security functions in software  and computer system  configurations are automated  in the development and  deployment of technologies.  Domestic cybersecurity products  are exported to other nations  and are considered superior  products.  The country has established a  body to assure the security of  foreign technologies (devices  and software) and supply chains,  or to certify entities which can  do this.  Cybersecurity  Services and  Expertise  Cybersecurity consultancy  services are not widely on offer  in the country.  Few if any service providers have  professional certification.  There are a growing number  of cybersecurity consultancy  services available for private and  public organisations.  A growing number of service  providers provide detail of the  professional certifications they  possess.  There may be limited or no  guidance to assist organisations  with the selection of service  providers.  There are widespread  cybersecurity consultancy  services available for private and  public organisations.  All service providers provide  details of the professional  certifications they possess.  A national body accredits service  providers, to assist organisations  in selecting service providers.  Private and public organisations  routinely seek advice from  cybersecurity consultancy  services, including advice about  emerging risks.  There is an adequate supply of  cybersecurity professionals in the  country.  The cybersecurity service sector  in the country helps shape the  international market.  57 Cybersecurity Capacity Maturity Model for Nations (CMM) - 2021 Edition  D3  D1  D4  D2  D5  D 5.1  D 5.2  D 5.3  D 5.4  D 5.5  D 5.6  Factor - D 5.5: Cybersecurity Marketplace Aspect Start-Up Formative Established Strategic Dynamic  Security  Implications of  Outsourcing  No risk assessments are  conducted to determine how to  mitigate the risks of outsourcing  IT to a third party or cloud  services.  There is a lack of understanding  of the security measures that the  outsourced IT service provider  applies.  Some organisations and sectors  conduct risk assessments to  determine how to mitigate the  risks of outsourcing IT to a third  party or cloud services.  At least some organisations and  sectors understand the security  measures that the outsourced IT  service provider applies.  At least some organisations have  developed business continuity  and disaster recovery processes.  Most major organisations from  the public and private sectors  conduct risk assessments to  determine how to mitigate the  risks of outsourcing IT to a third  party or cloud services.  There is widespread  understanding of the security  guarantees provided by the  outsourced IT service providers.  Most organisations have  developed and tested processes  to support business continuity  and disaster recovery.  Insights arising from risk  assessments are routinely  analysed in order to establish  and promote cybersecurity best  practices to mitigate the risk of  outsourcing IT.  Different risk scenarios with the  IT service provider are explored  and tested, including emerging  risks.  The country is contributing  to international best practice  on how to mitigate the risk of  outsourcing IT.  Cyber  Insurance  The need for a cyber-insurance  market may have been identified,  but no products and services  are widely available, either  domestically or from external  providers.  The need for a market in cyber- insurance has been identified  through the assessment of  financial risks for the public  and private sectors, and the  appropriateness of available  offerings is now being discussed.  A market for cyber-insurance is  established and encourages the  sharing of threat- information  among participants of the  market.  Products suitable for small and  medium-sized enterprises (SMEs)  are also on offer.  Cyber-insurance market offers  a variety of covers to mitigate  consequential losses.  Cover is selected by organisations  based on strategic planning  needs and identified risk.  The cyber-insurance market  is innovative and adapts to  emerging risks, standards and  practices, while addressing the  full scope of cyber harm.  Insurance premium reductions  are offered for consistent cyber- secure behaviour.  Cyber-insurance practices in  the country help to shape the  international market.  58 Cybersecurity Capacity Maturity Model for Nations (CMM) - 2021 Edition  D3  D1  D4  D2  D5  D 5.1  D 5.2  D 5.3  D 5.4  D 5.5  D 5.6  Factor - D 5.6: Responsible Disclosure Aspect Start-Up Formative Established Strategic Dynamic  Sharing  Vulnerability  Information  There is no informal way of  sharing information among the  stakeholders about the technical  details of vulnerabilities.  Software and service providers  generally lack the ability to  address bug and vulnerability  reports.  Technical details of vulnerabilities  are shared informally with other  stakeholders which can distribute  the information more broadly.  Software and service providers  are able to address bug and  vulnerability reports but there  may not be formal protocols for  doing so.  There are formal information- sharing mechanisms or channels  in place to share the technical  details of vulnerabilities with  other stakeholders, which can  distribute the information more  broadly.  A substantial proportion of  vulnerabilities in products and  services are remedied within  defined deadlines after their  discovery.  Vulnerability information-sharing  mechanisms are continuously  reviewed and updated based  on the needs of all affected  stakeholders, and in the light of  emerging risks.  All affected products and services  are routinely updated within  defined deadline.  Processes are in place to review  and reduce deadlines where  possible.  The country is contributing to  the debate and international  best practice on the sharing of  vulnerability information.  Policies,  Processes and  Legislation for  Responsible  Disclosure of  Security Flaws  The need for a responsible- disclosure policy in public and  private sector organisations, and  the right to legal protections for  those disclosing security flaws  are not yet acknowledged.  The need for a responsible- disclosure policy in public and  private sector organisations  is recognised but policies or  processes may not be in place, or  may only be in development.  The right to legal protections for  those disclosing security flaws is  recognised but legislation may  not be in place; or may only be in  development.  Software and service providers  commit to refraining from  taking legal action against a  party disclosing information  responsibly.  A responsible-disclosure  policy or framework is in place  in public and private sector  organisations, and includes a  disclosure deadline, scheduled  resolution, and the need for  acknowledgement.  Organisations have established  processes to receive and  disseminate vulnerability  information responsibly.  The right to legal protections for  those disclosing security flaws  responsibly is in place.  Responsible-disclosure policies  and processes are continuously  reviewed and updated based  on the needs of all affected  stakeholders and in the light of  emerging risks.  An analysis of the technical  details of vulnerabilities  is published and advisory  information is disseminated  according to individual roles and  responsibilities.  The country is contributing to the  debate on responsible-disclosure  frameworks and legal protections  for those disclosing security flaws  responsibly.  59 Cybersecurity Capacity Maturity Model for Nations (CMM) - 2021 Edition  D3  D4  D2  D5  D1  This CMM 2021 Edition builds on the success of the model over the last six years by considering  the changing cyber threat to users, the lessons learned from more than 120 CMM reviews  undertaken around the world, and the feedback from cybersecurity experts.  The decision to revise the CMM was informed by two key factors:  • The need to respond to all pertinent aspects of threat, systems vulnerabilities and  consequential harm due to changing operational environments and risks; and  • Re-assessment of the changing cybersecurity control landscape and risk management  practices available to the community.  To determine whether or not to propose a change to the CMM, or to the evidence required to  justify an attainment of capacity maturity, the following decision process was followed.  All potential changes to be included in the CMM 2021 Edition had to meet the following criteria:  • Each change must have been proposed by partners, users, or expert advisors. It must be  based on experience in deploying the model, feedback from a country which has used the  model or from a member of the international stakeholder community with particular insight  into changing environments that need be taken into account;  • The change must have been discussed with the GCSCC Expert Advisory Panel, regional,  strategic and implementation partners and other experts during the online conference calls  and/or one-to-one online meetings. Clear consensus must have been reached amongst the  attendees;  • The change must have been discussed at the CMM Revision Workshop in February 2020.  Clear consensus must have been reached amongst attendees;  • Global Constellation partners and strategic and implementation partners must have been  consulted; and  • Members of the GCSCC Technical Board must agree that the changes are desirable.  Those criteria that did not meet the requirements were documented as requiring further  research and consultation.  Evolution of the CMM  60 Cybersecurity Capacity Maturity Model for Nations (CMM) - 2021 Edition  D3  D4  D2  D5  D1  This CMM 2021 Edition was developed by the GCSCC with significant contributions by its partners and collaborators:  GCSCC Technical Board  GCSCC Research Team  GCSCC Expert Advisory Panel  Global Constellation Partners  • Cybersecurity Capacity Centre for Southern Africa (C3SA), Cape Town, South Africa  • Oceania Cyber Security Centre (OCSC), Melbourne, Australia  Strategic and Implementation Partners  • Commonwealth Telecommunications Organisation (CTO)  • Global Forum on Cyber Expertise (GFCE)  • International Telecommunication Union (ITU)  • NRD Cyber Security  • Organization of American States (OAS)  • World Bank  More than 150 individuals contributed to different steps of the revision process, too many to list them all.

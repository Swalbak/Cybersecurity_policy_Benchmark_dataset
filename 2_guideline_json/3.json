The term “asset” or “assets” is used in multiple 137  frameworks and documents. Examples include laptop computers, desktop computers, servers, 138  sensors, data, mobile phones, tablets, routers, and switches. In instances where the authors mean 139  “assets” as they appear on a balance sheet, the word “asset” will be preceded by words such as 140  “high-level,” “balance sheet,” or “Level 1” to differentiate context. 141  Note to Reviewers 142  The authors are grateful for the feedback and support provided by the community in response to 143  draft publications. In support of the final edition of this report, NIST asks that readers review the 144  following questions and consider these in your feedback and recommendations. 145  1. Is this document a useful extension of the concepts in SP 800-221? 146  2. Is the framework comprehensive with respect to risk governance and risk management? 147  If not, what additional items should NIST consider? 148  3. Does the framework support and advance your current risk governance and risk 149  management practices? If not, what additional practices should NIST include? 150  4. Has this publication provided adequate explanation for how the framework might be used 151  with and support program risk frameworks (e.g., Cybersecurity Framework, Privacy 152  Framework)? 153  5. Does this publication effectively relate to both private- and public-sector enterprises 154  through its structure, terminologies, and examples? 155  6. Are there additional ICTRM/ERM-related topics that would be helpful to include in 156  future iterations of this publication? 157  7. Is the relationship between SP 800-221A and Cybersecurity and Privacy Reference Tool 158  (CPRT) (https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/cprt) clear? Is CPRT a helpful supplement to SP 159  800-221A? 160  Call for Patent Claims 161  This public review includes a call for information on essential patent claims (claims whose use 162  would be required for compliance with the guidance or requirements in this Information 163  Technology Laboratory (ITL) draft publication).

Specific types of 201  ICT risk include, but are not limited to, cybersecurity, privacy, supply chain, and artificial 202  intelligence risk.  203  1.1 Purpose and Scope 204  This document provides a framework of outcomes that applies to all types of ICT risk. It 205  complements NIST Special Publication (SP) 800-221, Enterprise Impact of Information and 206  Communication Technology Risk [SP800221], which focuses on the use of risk registers to 207  communicate and manage ICT risk. Before reading this publication, you should first read NIST 208  SP 800-221 so that you understand the concepts and context for the information contained in the 209  framework of outcomes. 210  NIST has already defined outcome-based frameworks for several types of ICT risk, including the 211  Cybersecurity Framework [CSF], the Privacy Framework [PF], and the Secure Software 212  Development Framework [SSDF]. The outcomes in those frameworks are effectively more 213  specific instances of the outcomes in the more general framework defined in this publication. 214  1.2 Publication Contents 215  The remainder of this publication is organized into the following major sections: 216  • Section 2 provides an overview of ICT processes as a context for ERM. 217  • Section 3 defines the framework of ICT risk outcomes and explains the significance of 218  each field within the framework. 219  • The References section defines the references cited in this publication. 220  • Appendix A contains acronyms used in the publication. 221  NIST SP 800-221A ipd  ICT RISK OUTCOMES  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  2  2 Information and Communications Technology Areas 222  ERM is the highest terminus of ICT risk management (ICTRM). As with NIST SP 800-221, the 223  processes described within this publication focus on ICTRM within, between, and across ICT 224  areas. ICTRM helps ensure that leaders and stakeholders are supported by a holistic risk 225  monitoring and communication model, 226  which is needed for the complexity of risks 227  at the enterprise level.  228  An ICT Risk Outcomes Framework (ROF) 229  is needed to support ICT risk escalation and 230  elevation, as well as reduce ICTRM 231  complexity. While the focus of many risk 232  management program frameworks is the 233  comprehensiveness of each program’s 234  controls, the ICT ROF focuses on the 235  comprehensiveness of overarching risk 236  governance and management. Specifically, 237  the ICT ROF enumerates distinct outcomes 238  associated with the ICTRM process 239  described in NIST SP 800-221 and 240  illustrated in Figure 1. 241  The risk governance outcomes of the ICT 242  ROF are meant to be applied at select levels 243  in a given organization. Typically, risk 244  governance will occur at the enterprise 245  level, and may also occur at the 246  organization level. 247  The risk management outcomes of the 248  ICT ROF may be applied at all levels in a 249  given organization. The risk management 250  outcomes are highly relevant to individual 251  risk management programs and may be 252  used alongside risk management program 253  frameworks.  254  Figure 1: ICTRM Process  NIST SP 800-221A ipd  ICT RISK OUTCOMES  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  3  3 ICT Risk Outcomes Framework (ROF) 255  This section defines the ICT ROF, a framework for integrating ICT risk with enterprise risk. The 256  ICT ROF is a set of desired outcomes and applicable references that are common across all types 257  of ICT risk. It provides a common language for understanding, managing, and expressing ICT 258  risk to internal and external stakeholders. It can be used to help identify and prioritize actions for 259  reducing ICT risk, and it is a tool for aligning policy, business, and technological approaches to 260  managing that risk. Using the framework for each type of ICT risk will help organizations 261  improve the quality and consistency of ICT risk information they provide as inputs to their ERM 262  programs. That, in turn, will help organizations address all forms of ICT risk more effectively in 263  their ERM. 264  The ICT ROF is comprised of the following components: 265  • Functions organize ICT risk outcomes at their highest level. There are two Functions: 266  o Govern (GV): Develop and implement the organizational business logic for risk 267  management, and ensure risk management is performed according to that business 268  logic. 269  o Manage (MA): Continuously identify and address risks in accordance with the 270  organization’s risk management policies, processes, and priorities. 271  • Categories are the subdivisions of a Function into groups of ICT risk outcomes closely 272  tied to programmatic needs and particular activities. Examples of Categories include:  273  o Roles and Responsibilities (GV.RR) 274  o Risk Analysis (MA.RA) 275  o Risk Monitoring, Evaluation, and Adjustment (MA.RM) 276  • Subcategories further divide a Category into specific outcomes of technical and/or 277  management activities. While not exhaustive, they help support achievement of the 278  outcomes in each Category. Examples of Subcategories include:  279  o GV.RR-1: Risk governance roles and responsibilities are established and 280  communicated. 281  o MA.RA-1: The likelihood of each risk event is estimated using risk assessment 282  techniques and probability models. 283  o MA.RM-4: When risk exceeds risk tolerance, changes to risk responses are 284  identified and planned. 285  • Informative Examples are one or more notional examples of how tools, processes, or 286  other methods could be used to help achieve a Subcategory. No examples or combination 287  of examples are required, and the stated examples are not the only feasible options. Some 288  examples may not be applicable to certain organizations and situations. Examples of 289  Informative Examples include: 290  o For GV.RR-1: An organization establishes which roles are responsible for 291  documenting risk appetite and policy, as well as performing risk oversight. 292  NIST SP 800-221A ipd  ICT RISK OUTCOMES  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  4  o For MA.RA-1: Bayesian models, event tree analysis, or similar techniques are 293  used to determine the likelihood of a risk, and that information is recorded in the 294  Current Assessment – Likelihood field in a risk register. 295  o For MA.RM-4: KRIs are monitored to determine when risk exceeds risk 296  tolerance, resulting in updates to the risk register and planning of a revised risk 297  response, risk response type, risk response cost, and/or risk response description. 298  • Informative References are specific sections of standards, guidelines, and practices that 299  illustrate a method to achieve the outcomes associated with each Subcategory. The 300  Informative References are intended to be illustrative and not exhaustive. To avoid 301  having to re-release this publication every time an Informative Reference is added or 302  updated, Informative References are omitted from this publication. Instead, they will be 303  held in NIST’s Online Informative References (OLIR) Catalog. 304  For ease of use, each Function, Category, and Subcategory is assigned a unique identifier. Table 305  1 lists the identifiers for the Functions and Categories to show the framework’s overall structure. 306  Table 1 Function and Category Unique Identifiers 307  Function Category  GOVERN (GV) Context (GV.CT)  Roles and Responsibilities (GV.RR)  Policy (GV.PO)  Benchmarking (GV.BE)  Communication (GV.CO)  Adjustments (GV.AD)  Oversight (GV.OV)  MANAGE (MA) Risk Identification (MA.RI)  Risk Analysis (MA.RA)  Risk Prioritization (MA.RP)  Risk Response (MA.RR)  Risk Monitoring, Evaluation, and Adjustment (MA.RM)  Risk Communication (MA.RC)  Risk Improvement (MA.IM)  Table 2 defines all of the Functions, Categories, Subcategories, and Informative Examples in the 308  ICT ROF. Table 2 includes only a subset of what an organization may need to do and achieve. 309  The information in the table is space-constrained; much more information can be found from the 310  Informative References in the NIST OLIR Catalog. Note that the order of the Functions, 311  Categories, and Subcategories in the table is not intended to imply the sequence of 312  implementation or the relative importance of any Function, Category, or Subcategory. 313  https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/olir/informative-reference-catalog  NIST SP 800-221A ipd  ICT RISK OUTCOMES  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  5  Table 2 ICT Risk Outcomes Framework 314  Function Category Subcategory Informative Example  GOVERN (GV):  Develop and  implement the  organizational  business logic for  risk management,  and ensure risk  management is  performed according  to that business  logic.  Context (GV.CT): The  organization’s risk context,  including mission, mission  priorities, stakeholders,  objectives, and direction, is  understood.  GV.CT-1: Organizational mission, vision,  and authorities are understood and  considered.  An organization builds upon statute and authorities  thereof to develop its two-year mission and five-year  vision statements.  GV.CT-2: Internal and outside stakeholder  groups that affect or are affected by the  organization are identified.  An organization periodically inventories groups of  people that affect, and are affected by, the  organization.  GV.CT-3: The priorities, expectations, and  effects of outside stakeholder groups are  understood and considered.  An organization understands and considers outside  stakeholder expectations such as:  - Privacy expectations of customers  - Business expectations of partners  - Compliance expectations of regulators  - Ethics expectations of society  GV.CT-4: The priorities, expectations, and  effects of internal stakeholder groups are  understood and considered.  An organization understands and considers internal  stakeholder expectations such as:  - Cultural expectations of employees  - Achievement expectations of officers and directors  GV.CT-5: Organizational charter,  expectations, and objectives are aligned,  prioritized, and communicated as risk  context.  As part of annual strategic planning, an organization  performs a strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and  threats (SWOT) analysis to determine near-term and  long-term objectives, risks, and risk appetite. The  objectives, risks, and risk appetite are documented  and communicated in the form of a strategy.  GV.CT-6: Mission/business functions and  criticality are communicated as risk context.  Risk activities account for mission/business impact in  the Impact field of the risk register, and account for  mission/business criticality in the business impact  analysis (BIA).  Roles and Responsibilities  (GV.RR): Positions, duties, and  authorities for risk governance  and management are  established and communicated.  GV.RR-1: Risk governance roles and  responsibilities are established and  communicated.  An organization establishes which roles are  responsible for documenting risk appetite and policy,  as well as performing risk oversight.  GV.RR-2: Risk management roles and  responsibilities are established and  communicated.  An organization establishes which roles are  responsible for extending risk appetite into risk  tolerance, as well as identifying, prioritizing,  responding to, monitoring, evaluating, and adjusting  risk.  Policy (GV.PO): The policies to  manage and monitor the  organization’s regulatory, legal,  risk, environmental, and  operational requirements are  understood.  GV.PO-1: Risk management stances,  activities, appetites, roles, and authorities  are established and communicated.  An organization authors and disseminates a risk  management policy that declares stances (what the  organization will, and will not, do), activities related to  those stances, risk limitations using risk appetite  statements, and expectations and authorities  associated with key roles such as the Chief Executive  NIST SP 800-221A ipd  ICT RISK OUTCOMES  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  6  Function Category Subcategory Informative Example  Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Chief Risk Officer, and  Chief Information Security Officer.  GV.PO-2: Organizational stances, activities,  roles, and authorities that affect risk  management are aligned with risk policies  and appetite.  An organization considers risk policies and risk  appetite statements when developing policies that  affect/support risk management.  GV.PO-3: Organizational stances, activities,  roles, and authorities that are affected by  risk management are aligned with risk  policies and appetite.  When developing policies that are affected by risk  management, an organization aligns those policies  with risk policies and risk appetite statements.  Benchmarking (GV.BE):  Methods, criteria, and  expectations for discovering  and distinguishing risk are  established, communicated,  and followed.  GV.BE-1: High-level organizational risks are  periodically catalogued, categorized, and  communicated.  Annually, an organization uses enterprise risk  scenarios as a basis for adjusting the high-level risks  represented in a risk breakdown structure.  GV.BE-2: Risk appetite statements are  developed and periodically communicated to  risk management programs.  As a part of annual strategic planning, a corporation  determines its risk appetite and communicates its risk  appetite statements to risk management programs via  a strategic plan.  GV.BE-3: Risk tolerance statements are  created as more specific translations of risk  appetite statements and communicated to  risk management programs as a basis for  identifying risk.  An organization translates risk appetite statements into  more specific, measurable, and broadly  understandable risk tolerance statements in  preparation to distribute the labor of risk management  across a team of personnel.  GV.BE-4: Risk scenarios that describe  assets, threats, vulnerabilities, probabilities,  and impacts are crafted and communicated.  Annually, an organization creates and refines  anticipated enterprise risk scenarios as a basis for  adjusting the high-level risks represented in a risk  breakdown structure.  Communication (GV.CO):  Methods, criteria, and  schedules for expressing and  explaining risk are established,  communicated, and followed.  GV.CO-1: Mandatory and voluntary  disclosure decisions are informed through  an enterprise risk profile and performed on a  scheduled or as-needed (e.g., incident  disclosure) basis.  Information from the enterprise risk register (ERR)  forms the basis for a quarterly enterprise risk profile  (ERP) update and informs quarterly and annual public  disclosures.  A data breach involving protected health information  (PHI) triggers mandatory reporting to PHI owners and  regulators.  GV.CO-2: An enterprise risk communication  format is established, communicated, and  used as the basis for communication with  risk management programs.  An ERR and standardized values and instructions for  ERR fields are created, occasionally updated, and  communicated to risk management programs as the  expected risk reporting format.  GV.CO-3: Criteria for immediate and  periodic escalation of program risks are  established, communicated, understood,  and used as the basis for risk  communication.  An ERM committee documents and communicates  escalation criteria to the risk management programs  periodically.  NIST SP 800-221A ipd  ICT RISK OUTCOMES  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  7  Function Category Subcategory Informative Example  GV.CO-4: Criteria for transfer of elevation of  risk ownership are established,  communicated, understood, and used as the  basis for risk communication.  An ERM committee documents and communicates  elevation criteria to the risk management programs  periodically.  Adjustments (GV.AD): Risk  governance is adapted based  on changes in organizational  objectives, risk exposure, and  residual risk.  GV.AD-1: Risk appetite is adjusted based  on changes in organizational objectives, risk  exposure, and residual risk.  An organization’s annual strategic planning refines  organizational objectives and risk appetite based on  known risk exposure and residual risk.  GV.AD-2: Strategic opportunities (aka  positive risks) are adjusted based on  changes in organizational objectives, risk  exposure, and residual risk.  Among other things, risk exposure and residual risk  from the risk register are considered in trade-off  analysis with opportunities, and adjustments may be  made to opportunity scope.  GV.AD-3: Strategic priorities are adjusted  based on changes in organizational  objectives, risk exposure, and residual risk.  Among other things, risk exposure and residual risk  from the risk register are considered in trade-off  analysis with opportunities, and adjustments may be  made to opportunity priority, timeline, or budget.  Oversight (GV.OV): Risk is  identified and addressed by risk  management programs  according to the criteria and  expectations of risk  governance.  GV.OV-1: Risk appetite statements and  related contextual information are  understood and applied by risk management  programs.  Portfolio-level personnel verify that risk management  programs understand and are applying risk appetite  statements appropriately by evaluating what risks are  communicated in the risk register.  GV.OV-2: Assigned roles, responsibilities,  and authorities are understood and  implemented by risk management programs.  Portfolio-level personnel verify that risk management  programs understand and are implementing roles,  responsibilities, and authorities appropriately by  evaluating that assigned responsibilities are being  fulfilled and by whom.  GV.OV-3: Organizational risk management  policy and policies affecting risk  management are understood and  implemented by risk management programs.  Portfolio-level personnel monitor stances to verify that  risk policies, and risk affecting policies, are upheld.  GV.OV-4: Risk tolerance statements are  used by risk management program  personnel as a basis for identifying risk.  Portfolio-level personnel verify that risk management  programs understand and are applying risk tolerance  statements appropriately by evaluating what risks are  communicated in the risk register.  GV.OV-5: Risk is identified, adjudicated, and  tracked by risk management programs  according to published formats.  A risk management program uses the ERR as a basis  for its risk register, and regularly communicates with  Level 2 and Level 1 risk personnel using that program  risk register.  GV.OV-6: Risk is communicated and  transferred by risk management programs  according to published escalation and  elevation criteria and process.  A risk management program uses criteria provided by  Level 2 risk personnel to escalate risks to the attention  of Level 2 risk personnel and elevate risks for  management by Level 2 risk personnel.  NIST SP 800-221A ipd  ICT RISK OUTCOMES  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  8  Function Category Subcategory Informative Example  GV.OV-7: Risk management programs  provide feedback for adjustment of risk  appetite, opportunities, and strategic  priorities.  A risk management program provides feedback to  Level 2 and Level 1 risk managers when more risks  exceed tolerance than current budgets will support.  MANAGE (MA):  Continuously identify  and address risks in  accordance with the  organization’s risk  management  policies, processes,  and priorities.  Risk Identification (MA.RI):  Risk events for the organization  are catalogued and recorded.  MA.RI-1: The assets (data, personnel,  devices, systems, facilities, third-party  services, etc.) that enable the organization  to achieve its objectives are identified along  with the assets’ relative importance to those  objectives and the organization’s strategy.  The dependency between facility security and the  electronic badge reader technology system is  identified in a BIA, and any cyber risk to the electronic  badge reader system is recorded in the Risk  Description field of a risk register as something that  could adversely affect building security.  MA.RI-2: Threats against the organization’s  assets are identified and documented.  Threat intelligence sources are monitored for threats  that may adversely affect critical assets. Threat  modeling techniques are used to determine likely  impact. This information is compared to information  available from risk assessments and previous risk  events. Relevant threat information is recorded in the  Risk Description field of a risk register.  MA.RI-3: Vulnerabilities of the organization’s  assets are identified and documented.  Vulnerability sources are monitored for vulnerabilities  that affect critical assets, and relevant vulnerabilities  are recorded in the Risk Description field of a risk  register.  MA.RI-4: Potential consequences are  identified for each risk for the organization’s  assets and documented.  Risk cause and effect are documented as a risk  scenario and included in the Risk Description field of a  risk register.  MA.RI-5: Risks are categorized in  anticipation of future grouping and  combination.  The Risk Category field of a risk register is populated  with categories that are meaningful to an organization.  Risk Analysis (MA.RA): Risk  events are assessed for  likelihood and impact.  MA.RA-1: The likelihood of each risk event  is estimated using risk assessment  techniques and probability models.  Bayesian models, event tree analysis, or similar  techniques are used to determine the likelihood of a  risk, and that information is recorded in the Current  Assessment – Likelihood field in a risk register.  MA.RA-2: The impact of each risk event is  estimated using risk assessment techniques  that take into consideration both tangible  and less tangible impacts, including  secondary/cascading impacts, and the  estimated impact is recorded.  An organization uses prior event data and the three- point estimate to determine likely single-loss  expectancy (SLE) and annualized loss expectancy  (ALE) from a risk and records that information in the  Current Assessment – Impact field in a risk register.  Risk Prioritization (MA.RP):  Key risks are ranked for  response decisions.  MA.RP-1: The exposure presented by each  risk is determined using qualitative and/or  quantitative models and recorded.  An organization assigns a qualitative risk exposure  based on risk likelihood and impact and records that  determination in the Current Assessment – Exposure  Rating field of a risk register.  NIST SP 800-221A ipd  ICT RISK OUTCOMES  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  9  Function Category Subcategory Informative Example  MA.RP-2: The risks are prioritized based on  exposure and other factors using qualitative  and/or quantitative models, and the priorities  are recorded.  An organization uses a quantitative model to prioritize  its risks and records the priorities in the Priority field of  a risk register.  Risk Response (MA.RR): Risk  responses are developed,  costed, decided, described,  assigned, and executed.  MA.RR-1: The exposure associated with  each risk is checked against risk tolerance  statements to determine which risks need  transferred, mitigated, or avoided to achieve  information and communications technology  objectives.  An organization uses the exposure from a risk register  to decide an appropriate risk response.  MA.RR-2: A risk response that will achieve  business objectives and comply with risk  guidance from leadership is identified,  planned, and recorded, along with the  estimated cost of applying the risk response.  An organization chooses a risk response type and  estimates its cost, and records those in the Risk  Response Type and Risk Response Cost fields,  respectively, of a risk register.  MA.RR-3: A risk owner is assigned for each  risk response.  For each risk response in a risk register, a person is  assigned responsibility for the risk response action and  recorded in the Risk Owner field of the risk register.  MA.RR-4: Plans for implementing risk  responses are documented.  For each risk response in a risk register, a plan is  recorded in the Risk Response Description field of the  risk register.  MA-RR-5: Risk responses that will take an  extended period of time or require additional  funding to fully enact are recorded and  tracked.  A federal agency determines that a risk will take two  years to fully address and records the corresponding  risk plan in a Plan of Action & Milestones (POA&M)  document.  A private-sector organization determines that a risk will  require funding from next fiscal year to fully address  and records the corresponding risk plan in a project  plan.  MA.RR-6: Risk analysis is revised after risk  responses are determined to reflect the  envisioned reduction of likelihood and  impact from each risk response.  An organization updates the Current Assessment –  Likelihood, Impact, and Exposure Rating fields of a  risk register after the risk responses have been  documented.  MA.RR-7: Controls are implemented or  adjusted to perform risk response plans.  An organization implements security controls to enact  a risk response, and those actions are recorded in the  Risk Response Description field of a risk register.  MA.RR-8: Residual risk is forecasted for  each risk after risk responses are decided.  An organization estimates its residual risk and records  it in the Residual Risk field of a risk register.  Risk Monitoring, Evaluation,  and Adjustment (MA.RM):  Risks are checked and  MA.RM-1: Risk conditions are continually  monitored against risk tolerance to ensure  conditions remain within acceptable levels.  Risks are measured and benchmarked according to  key performance indicators (KPIs) and key risk  indicators (KRIs), respectively.  NIST SP 800-221A ipd  ICT RISK OUTCOMES  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  10  Function Category Subcategory Informative Example  assessed, and risk responses  are adapted as needed.  MA.RM-2: The effectiveness of risk  responses is evaluated against objectives to  identify risk that exceeds acceptable levels.  An organization compares target risks (Target Profile)  to current risks (Current Profile) and performs a gap  analysis.  MA.RM-3: Findings from audits and risk  assessments are analyzed to identify  changes in risk and the effectiveness of risk  responses.  A risk management program adjusts some risk  responses based on recent audit findings.  MA.RM-4: When risk exceeds risk tolerance,  changes to risk responses are identified and  planned.  KRIs are monitored to determine when risk exceeds  risk tolerance, resulting in updates to the risk register  and planning of a revised risk response, risk response  type, risk response cost, and/or risk response  description.  MA.RM-5: Risk tolerance statements and  budgets are adjusted as needed to reflect  appropriate risk responses.  A risk management program makes budgetary  adjustments when it identifies risks that are beyond  tolerance and cannot be addressed with current  budgets.  MA.RM-6: Risk response plans are updated  as needed to include monitoring and  measurement milestones that can trigger the  release or repurposing of management  reserve resources.  Risk response descriptions are updated in risk  registers to note KPIs and KRIs that will result in  access to management reserve.  MA.RM-7: Controls are adjusted to  implement changes to risk response plans.  An organization changes a risk response by  implementing security controls, and the updated  security controls are recorded in the Risk Response  Description field of a risk register.  MA.RM-8: Changes to risks are identified  and tracked.  Changes to risks are identified and recorded in  appropriate fields of a risk register.  Risk Communication  (MA.RC): Information on risks is  recorded and disseminated.  MA.RC-1: Details regarding the  considerations, assumptions, and results of  risk management activity are documented.  Details about risk assessment and risk response are  recorded as supplements to a risk register known as  risk assessment reports and risk detail records,  respectively.  MA.RC-2: Risks that match escalation  criteria are periodically communicated to  higher-level risk managers.  On a monthly basis, an ERM committee receives a  subset of risks from program risk registers as  candidates for addition to the ERR.  MA.RC-3: Risks that match elevation criteria  are transferred to higher-level risk managers  for ownership assignment.  As risk management programs evaluate risks, a risk  matches elevation criteria and is transferred to an  ERM committee for assignment to a Level 1 risk  owner.  MA.RC-4: Risks that match urgent  escalation or elevation criteria are  communicated immediately to higher-level  risk managers.  Risk management programs immediately escalate or  elevate risks to a ERM committee upon identifying that  those risks match criteria for immediate escalation or  elevation.  NIST SP 800-221A ipd  ICT RISK OUTCOMES  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  11  Function Category Subcategory Informative Example  Risk Improvement (MA.IM):  Errors in risk management are  reduced through root-cause  analysis and refinement  implementation.  MA.IM-1: Lessons learned while identifying  and addressing risks are communicated to  leadership.  Risk management programs provide quarterly reports  to leadership on their lessons learned and on trends  they are seeing.  MA.IM-2: Risk management is refined based  on analysis and feedback of circumstances  involving implicit risk acceptance.  Risk management programs are updated to take into  account the results of analyzing implicit risk  acceptance.  315  NIST SP 800-221A ipd  ICT RISK OUTCOMES  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  12  References 316  [CSF] National Institute of Standards and Technology (2018) Framework for Improving 317  Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity, Version 1.1.

Specific types of 201  ICT risk include, but are not limited to, cybersecurity, privacy, supply chain, and artificial 202  intelligence risk.  203  1.1 Purpose and Scope 204  This document provides a framework of outcomes that applies to all types of ICT risk. It 205  complements NIST Special Publication (SP) 800-221, Enterprise Impact of Information and 206  Communication Technology Risk [SP800221], which focuses on the use of risk registers to 207  communicate and manage ICT risk. Before reading this publication, you should first read NIST 208  SP 800-221 so that you understand the concepts and context for the information contained in the 209  framework of outcomes. 210  NIST has already defined outcome-based frameworks for several types of ICT risk, including the 211  Cybersecurity Framework [CSF], the Privacy Framework [PF], and the Secure Software 212  Development Framework [SSDF]. The outcomes in those frameworks are effectively more 213  specific instances of the outcomes in the more general framework defined in this publication. 214  1.2 Publication Contents 215  The remainder of this publication is organized into the following major sections: 216  • Section 2 provides an overview of ICT processes as a context for ERM. 217  • Section 3 defines the framework of ICT risk outcomes and explains the significance of 218  each field within the framework. 219  • The References section defines the references cited in this publication. 220  • Appendix A contains acronyms used in the publication. 221  NIST SP 800-221A ipd  ICT RISK OUTCOMES  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  2  2 Information and Communications Technology Areas 222  ERM is the highest terminus of ICT risk management (ICTRM). As with NIST SP 800-221, the 223  processes described within this publication focus on ICTRM within, between, and across ICT 224  areas. ICTRM helps ensure that leaders and stakeholders are supported by a holistic risk 225  monitoring and communication model, 226  which is needed for the complexity of risks 227  at the enterprise level.  228  An ICT Risk Outcomes Framework (ROF) 229  is needed to support ICT risk escalation and 230  elevation, as well as reduce ICTRM 231  complexity. While the focus of many risk 232  management program frameworks is the 233  comprehensiveness of each program’s 234  controls, the ICT ROF focuses on the 235  comprehensiveness of overarching risk 236  governance and management. Specifically, 237  the ICT ROF enumerates distinct outcomes 238  associated with the ICTRM process 239  described in NIST SP 800-221 and 240  illustrated in Figure 1. 241  The risk governance outcomes of the ICT 242  ROF are meant to be applied at select levels 243  in a given organization. Typically, risk 244  governance will occur at the enterprise 245  level, and may also occur at the 246  organization level. 247  The risk management outcomes of the 248  ICT ROF may be applied at all levels in a 249  given organization. The risk management 250  outcomes are highly relevant to individual 251  risk management programs and may be 252  used alongside risk management program 253  frameworks.  254  Figure 1: ICTRM Process  NIST SP 800-221A ipd  ICT RISK OUTCOMES  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  3  3 ICT Risk Outcomes Framework (ROF) 255  This section defines the ICT ROF, a framework for integrating ICT risk with enterprise risk. The 256  ICT ROF is a set of desired outcomes and applicable references that are common across all types 257  of ICT risk. It provides a common language for understanding, managing, and expressing ICT 258  risk to internal and external stakeholders. It can be used to help identify and prioritize actions for 259  reducing ICT risk, and it is a tool for aligning policy, business, and technological approaches to 260  managing that risk. Using the framework for each type of ICT risk will help organizations 261  improve the quality and consistency of ICT risk information they provide as inputs to their ERM 262  programs. That, in turn, will help organizations address all forms of ICT risk more effectively in 263  their ERM. 264  The ICT ROF is comprised of the following components: 265  • Functions organize ICT risk outcomes at their highest level. There are two Functions: 266  o Govern (GV): Develop and implement the organizational business logic for risk 267  management, and ensure risk management is performed according to that business 268  logic. 269  o Manage (MA): Continuously identify and address risks in accordance with the 270  organization’s risk management policies, processes, and priorities. 271  • Categories are the subdivisions of a Function into groups of ICT risk outcomes closely 272  tied to programmatic needs and particular activities. Examples of Categories include:  273  o Roles and Responsibilities (GV.RR) 274  o Risk Analysis (MA.RA) 275  o Risk Monitoring, Evaluation, and Adjustment (MA.RM) 276  • Subcategories further divide a Category into specific outcomes of technical and/or 277  management activities. While not exhaustive, they help support achievement of the 278  outcomes in each Category. Examples of Subcategories include:  279  o GV.RR-1: Risk governance roles and responsibilities are established and 280  communicated. 281  o MA.RA-1: The likelihood of each risk event is estimated using risk assessment 282  techniques and probability models. 283  o MA.RM-4: When risk exceeds risk tolerance, changes to risk responses are 284  identified and planned. 285  • Informative Examples are one or more notional examples of how tools, processes, or 286  other methods could be used to help achieve a Subcategory. No examples or combination 287  of examples are required, and the stated examples are not the only feasible options. Some 288  examples may not be applicable to certain organizations and situations. Examples of 289  Informative Examples include: 290  o For GV.RR-1: An organization establishes which roles are responsible for 291  documenting risk appetite and policy, as well as performing risk oversight. 292  NIST SP 800-221A ipd  ICT RISK OUTCOMES  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  4  o For MA.RA-1: Bayesian models, event tree analysis, or similar techniques are 293  used to determine the likelihood of a risk, and that information is recorded in the 294  Current Assessment – Likelihood field in a risk register. 295  o For MA.RM-4: KRIs are monitored to determine when risk exceeds risk 296  tolerance, resulting in updates to the risk register and planning of a revised risk 297  response, risk response type, risk response cost, and/or risk response description. 298  • Informative References are specific sections of standards, guidelines, and practices that 299  illustrate a method to achieve the outcomes associated with each Subcategory. The 300  Informative References are intended to be illustrative and not exhaustive. To avoid 301  having to re-release this publication every time an Informative Reference is added or 302  updated, Informative References are omitted from this publication. Instead, they will be 303  held in NIST’s Online Informative References (OLIR) Catalog. 304  For ease of use, each Function, Category, and Subcategory is assigned a unique identifier. Table 305  1 lists the identifiers for the Functions and Categories to show the framework’s overall structure. 306  Table 1 Function and Category Unique Identifiers 307  Function Category  GOVERN (GV) Context (GV.CT)  Roles and Responsibilities (GV.RR)  Policy (GV.PO)  Benchmarking (GV.BE)  Communication (GV.CO)  Adjustments (GV.AD)  Oversight (GV.OV)  MANAGE (MA) Risk Identification (MA.RI)  Risk Analysis (MA.RA)  Risk Prioritization (MA.RP)  Risk Response (MA.RR)  Risk Monitoring, Evaluation, and Adjustment (MA.RM)  Risk Communication (MA.RC)  Risk Improvement (MA.IM)  Table 2 defines all of the Functions, Categories, Subcategories, and Informative Examples in the 308  ICT ROF. Table 2 includes only a subset of what an organization may need to do and achieve. 309  The information in the table is space-constrained; much more information can be found from the 310  Informative References in the NIST OLIR Catalog. Note that the order of the Functions, 311  Categories, and Subcategories in the table is not intended to imply the sequence of 312  implementation or the relative importance of any Function, Category, or Subcategory. 313  https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/olir/informative-reference-catalog  NIST SP 800-221A ipd  ICT RISK OUTCOMES  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  5  Table 2 ICT Risk Outcomes Framework 314  Function Category Subcategory Informative Example  GOVERN (GV):  Develop and  implement the  organizational  business logic for  risk management,  and ensure risk  management is  performed according  to that business  logic.  Context (GV.CT): The  organization’s risk context,  including mission, mission  priorities, stakeholders,  objectives, and direction, is  understood.  GV.CT-1: Organizational mission, vision,  and authorities are understood and  considered.  An organization builds upon statute and authorities  thereof to develop its two-year mission and five-year  vision statements.  GV.CT-2: Internal and outside stakeholder  groups that affect or are affected by the  organization are identified.  An organization periodically inventories groups of  people that affect, and are affected by, the  organization.  GV.CT-3: The priorities, expectations, and  effects of outside stakeholder groups are  understood and considered.  An organization understands and considers outside  stakeholder expectations such as:  - Privacy expectations of customers  - Business expectations of partners  - Compliance expectations of regulators  - Ethics expectations of society  GV.CT-4: The priorities, expectations, and  effects of internal stakeholder groups are  understood and considered.  An organization understands and considers internal  stakeholder expectations such as:  - Cultural expectations of employees  - Achievement expectations of officers and directors  GV.CT-5: Organizational charter,  expectations, and objectives are aligned,  prioritized, and communicated as risk  context.  As part of annual strategic planning, an organization  performs a strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and  threats (SWOT) analysis to determine near-term and  long-term objectives, risks, and risk appetite. The  objectives, risks, and risk appetite are documented  and communicated in the form of a strategy.  GV.CT-6: Mission/business functions and  criticality are communicated as risk context.  Risk activities account for mission/business impact in  the Impact field of the risk register, and account for  mission/business criticality in the business impact  analysis (BIA).  Roles and Responsibilities  (GV.RR): Positions, duties, and  authorities for risk governance  and management are  established and communicated.  GV.RR-1: Risk governance roles and  responsibilities are established and  communicated.  An organization establishes which roles are  responsible for documenting risk appetite and policy,  as well as performing risk oversight.  GV.RR-2: Risk management roles and  responsibilities are established and  communicated.  An organization establishes which roles are  responsible for extending risk appetite into risk  tolerance, as well as identifying, prioritizing,  responding to, monitoring, evaluating, and adjusting  risk.  Policy (GV.PO): The policies to  manage and monitor the  organization’s regulatory, legal,  risk, environmental, and  operational requirements are  understood.  GV.PO-1: Risk management stances,  activities, appetites, roles, and authorities  are established and communicated.  An organization authors and disseminates a risk  management policy that declares stances (what the  organization will, and will not, do), activities related to  those stances, risk limitations using risk appetite  statements, and expectations and authorities  associated with key roles such as the Chief Executive  NIST SP 800-221A ipd  ICT RISK OUTCOMES  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  6  Function Category Subcategory Informative Example  Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Chief Risk Officer, and  Chief Information Security Officer.  GV.PO-2: Organizational stances, activities,  roles, and authorities that affect risk  management are aligned with risk policies  and appetite.  An organization considers risk policies and risk  appetite statements when developing policies that  affect/support risk management.  GV.PO-3: Organizational stances, activities,  roles, and authorities that are affected by  risk management are aligned with risk  policies and appetite.  When developing policies that are affected by risk  management, an organization aligns those policies  with risk policies and risk appetite statements.  Benchmarking (GV.BE):  Methods, criteria, and  expectations for discovering  and distinguishing risk are  established, communicated,  and followed.  GV.BE-1: High-level organizational risks are  periodically catalogued, categorized, and  communicated.  Annually, an organization uses enterprise risk  scenarios as a basis for adjusting the high-level risks  represented in a risk breakdown structure.  GV.BE-2: Risk appetite statements are  developed and periodically communicated to  risk management programs.  As a part of annual strategic planning, a corporation  determines its risk appetite and communicates its risk  appetite statements to risk management programs via  a strategic plan.  GV.BE-3: Risk tolerance statements are  created as more specific translations of risk  appetite statements and communicated to  risk management programs as a basis for  identifying risk.  An organization translates risk appetite statements into  more specific, measurable, and broadly  understandable risk tolerance statements in  preparation to distribute the labor of risk management  across a team of personnel.  GV.BE-4: Risk scenarios that describe  assets, threats, vulnerabilities, probabilities,  and impacts are crafted and communicated.  Annually, an organization creates and refines  anticipated enterprise risk scenarios as a basis for  adjusting the high-level risks represented in a risk  breakdown structure.  Communication (GV.CO):  Methods, criteria, and  schedules for expressing and  explaining risk are established,  communicated, and followed.  GV.CO-1: Mandatory and voluntary  disclosure decisions are informed through  an enterprise risk profile and performed on a  scheduled or as-needed (e.g., incident  disclosure) basis.  Information from the enterprise risk register (ERR)  forms the basis for a quarterly enterprise risk profile  (ERP) update and informs quarterly and annual public  disclosures.  A data breach involving protected health information  (PHI) triggers mandatory reporting to PHI owners and  regulators.  GV.CO-2: An enterprise risk communication  format is established, communicated, and  used as the basis for communication with  risk management programs.  An ERR and standardized values and instructions for  ERR fields are created, occasionally updated, and  communicated to risk management programs as the  expected risk reporting format.  GV.CO-3: Criteria for immediate and  periodic escalation of program risks are  established, communicated, understood,  and used as the basis for risk  communication.  An ERM committee documents and communicates  escalation criteria to the risk management programs  periodically.  NIST SP 800-221A ipd  ICT RISK OUTCOMES  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  7  Function Category Subcategory Informative Example  GV.CO-4: Criteria for transfer of elevation of  risk ownership are established,  communicated, understood, and used as the  basis for risk communication.  An ERM committee documents and communicates  elevation criteria to the risk management programs  periodically.  Adjustments (GV.AD): Risk  governance is adapted based  on changes in organizational  objectives, risk exposure, and  residual risk.  GV.AD-1: Risk appetite is adjusted based  on changes in organizational objectives, risk  exposure, and residual risk.  An organization’s annual strategic planning refines  organizational objectives and risk appetite based on  known risk exposure and residual risk.  GV.AD-2: Strategic opportunities (aka  positive risks) are adjusted based on  changes in organizational objectives, risk  exposure, and residual risk.  Among other things, risk exposure and residual risk  from the risk register are considered in trade-off  analysis with opportunities, and adjustments may be  made to opportunity scope.  GV.AD-3: Strategic priorities are adjusted  based on changes in organizational  objectives, risk exposure, and residual risk.  Among other things, risk exposure and residual risk  from the risk register are considered in trade-off  analysis with opportunities, and adjustments may be  made to opportunity priority, timeline, or budget.  Oversight (GV.OV): Risk is  identified and addressed by risk  management programs  according to the criteria and  expectations of risk  governance.  GV.OV-1: Risk appetite statements and  related contextual information are  understood and applied by risk management  programs.  Portfolio-level personnel verify that risk management  programs understand and are applying risk appetite  statements appropriately by evaluating what risks are  communicated in the risk register.  GV.OV-2: Assigned roles, responsibilities,  and authorities are understood and  implemented by risk management programs.  Portfolio-level personnel verify that risk management  programs understand and are implementing roles,  responsibilities, and authorities appropriately by  evaluating that assigned responsibilities are being  fulfilled and by whom.  GV.OV-3: Organizational risk management  policy and policies affecting risk  management are understood and  implemented by risk management programs.  Portfolio-level personnel monitor stances to verify that  risk policies, and risk affecting policies, are upheld.  GV.OV-4: Risk tolerance statements are  used by risk management program  personnel as a basis for identifying risk.  Portfolio-level personnel verify that risk management  programs understand and are applying risk tolerance  statements appropriately by evaluating what risks are  communicated in the risk register.  GV.OV-5: Risk is identified, adjudicated, and  tracked by risk management programs  according to published formats.  A risk management program uses the ERR as a basis  for its risk register, and regularly communicates with  Level 2 and Level 1 risk personnel using that program  risk register.  GV.OV-6: Risk is communicated and  transferred by risk management programs  according to published escalation and  elevation criteria and process.  A risk management program uses criteria provided by  Level 2 risk personnel to escalate risks to the attention  of Level 2 risk personnel and elevate risks for  management by Level 2 risk personnel.  NIST SP 800-221A ipd  ICT RISK OUTCOMES  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  8  Function Category Subcategory Informative Example  GV.OV-7: Risk management programs  provide feedback for adjustment of risk  appetite, opportunities, and strategic  priorities.  A risk management program provides feedback to  Level 2 and Level 1 risk managers when more risks  exceed tolerance than current budgets will support.  MANAGE (MA):  Continuously identify  and address risks in  accordance with the  organization’s risk  management  policies, processes,  and priorities.  Risk Identification (MA.RI):  Risk events for the organization  are catalogued and recorded.  MA.RI-1: The assets (data, personnel,  devices, systems, facilities, third-party  services, etc.) that enable the organization  to achieve its objectives are identified along  with the assets’ relative importance to those  objectives and the organization’s strategy.  The dependency between facility security and the  electronic badge reader technology system is  identified in a BIA, and any cyber risk to the electronic  badge reader system is recorded in the Risk  Description field of a risk register as something that  could adversely affect building security.  MA.RI-2: Threats against the organization’s  assets are identified and documented.  Threat intelligence sources are monitored for threats  that may adversely affect critical assets. Threat  modeling techniques are used to determine likely  impact. This information is compared to information  available from risk assessments and previous risk  events. Relevant threat information is recorded in the  Risk Description field of a risk register.  MA.RI-3: Vulnerabilities of the organization’s  assets are identified and documented.  Vulnerability sources are monitored for vulnerabilities  that affect critical assets, and relevant vulnerabilities  are recorded in the Risk Description field of a risk  register.  MA.RI-4: Potential consequences are  identified for each risk for the organization’s  assets and documented.  Risk cause and effect are documented as a risk  scenario and included in the Risk Description field of a  risk register.  MA.RI-5: Risks are categorized in  anticipation of future grouping and  combination.  The Risk Category field of a risk register is populated  with categories that are meaningful to an organization.  Risk Analysis (MA.RA): Risk  events are assessed for  likelihood and impact.  MA.RA-1: The likelihood of each risk event  is estimated using risk assessment  techniques and probability models.  Bayesian models, event tree analysis, or similar  techniques are used to determine the likelihood of a  risk, and that information is recorded in the Current  Assessment – Likelihood field in a risk register.  MA.RA-2: The impact of each risk event is  estimated using risk assessment techniques  that take into consideration both tangible  and less tangible impacts, including  secondary/cascading impacts, and the  estimated impact is recorded.  An organization uses prior event data and the three- point estimate to determine likely single-loss  expectancy (SLE) and annualized loss expectancy  (ALE) from a risk and records that information in the  Current Assessment – Impact field in a risk register.  Risk Prioritization (MA.RP):  Key risks are ranked for  response decisions.  MA.RP-1: The exposure presented by each  risk is determined using qualitative and/or  quantitative models and recorded.  An organization assigns a qualitative risk exposure  based on risk likelihood and impact and records that  determination in the Current Assessment – Exposure  Rating field of a risk register.  NIST SP 800-221A ipd  ICT RISK OUTCOMES  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  9  Function Category Subcategory Informative Example  MA.RP-2: The risks are prioritized based on  exposure and other factors using qualitative  and/or quantitative models, and the priorities  are recorded.  An organization uses a quantitative model to prioritize  its risks and records the priorities in the Priority field of  a risk register.  Risk Response (MA.RR): Risk  responses are developed,  costed, decided, described,  assigned, and executed.  MA.RR-1: The exposure associated with  each risk is checked against risk tolerance  statements to determine which risks need  transferred, mitigated, or avoided to achieve  information and communications technology  objectives.  An organization uses the exposure from a risk register  to decide an appropriate risk response.  MA.RR-2: A risk response that will achieve  business objectives and comply with risk  guidance from leadership is identified,  planned, and recorded, along with the  estimated cost of applying the risk response.  An organization chooses a risk response type and  estimates its cost, and records those in the Risk  Response Type and Risk Response Cost fields,  respectively, of a risk register.  MA.RR-3: A risk owner is assigned for each  risk response.  For each risk response in a risk register, a person is  assigned responsibility for the risk response action and  recorded in the Risk Owner field of the risk register.  MA.RR-4: Plans for implementing risk  responses are documented.  For each risk response in a risk register, a plan is  recorded in the Risk Response Description field of the  risk register.  MA-RR-5: Risk responses that will take an  extended period of time or require additional  funding to fully enact are recorded and  tracked.  A federal agency determines that a risk will take two  years to fully address and records the corresponding  risk plan in a Plan of Action & Milestones (POA&M)  document.  A private-sector organization determines that a risk will  require funding from next fiscal year to fully address  and records the corresponding risk plan in a project  plan.  MA.RR-6: Risk analysis is revised after risk  responses are determined to reflect the  envisioned reduction of likelihood and  impact from each risk response.  An organization updates the Current Assessment –  Likelihood, Impact, and Exposure Rating fields of a  risk register after the risk responses have been  documented.  MA.RR-7: Controls are implemented or  adjusted to perform risk response plans.  An organization implements security controls to enact  a risk response, and those actions are recorded in the  Risk Response Description field of a risk register.  MA.RR-8: Residual risk is forecasted for  each risk after risk responses are decided.  An organization estimates its residual risk and records  it in the Residual Risk field of a risk register.  Risk Monitoring, Evaluation,  and Adjustment (MA.RM):  Risks are checked and  MA.RM-1: Risk conditions are continually  monitored against risk tolerance to ensure  conditions remain within acceptable levels.  Risks are measured and benchmarked according to  key performance indicators (KPIs) and key risk  indicators (KRIs), respectively.  NIST SP 800-221A ipd  ICT RISK OUTCOMES  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  10  Function Category Subcategory Informative Example  assessed, and risk responses  are adapted as needed.  MA.RM-2: The effectiveness of risk  responses is evaluated against objectives to  identify risk that exceeds acceptable levels.  An organization compares target risks (Target Profile)  to current risks (Current Profile) and performs a gap  analysis.  MA.RM-3: Findings from audits and risk  assessments are analyzed to identify  changes in risk and the effectiveness of risk  responses.  A risk management program adjusts some risk  responses based on recent audit findings.  MA.RM-4: When risk exceeds risk tolerance,  changes to risk responses are identified and  planned.  KRIs are monitored to determine when risk exceeds  risk tolerance, resulting in updates to the risk register  and planning of a revised risk response, risk response  type, risk response cost, and/or risk response  description.  MA.RM-5: Risk tolerance statements and  budgets are adjusted as needed to reflect  appropriate risk responses.  A risk management program makes budgetary  adjustments when it identifies risks that are beyond  tolerance and cannot be addressed with current  budgets.  MA.RM-6: Risk response plans are updated  as needed to include monitoring and  measurement milestones that can trigger the  release or repurposing of management  reserve resources.  Risk response descriptions are updated in risk  registers to note KPIs and KRIs that will result in  access to management reserve.  MA.RM-7: Controls are adjusted to  implement changes to risk response plans.  An organization changes a risk response by  implementing security controls, and the updated  security controls are recorded in the Risk Response  Description field of a risk register.  MA.RM-8: Changes to risks are identified  and tracked.  Changes to risks are identified and recorded in  appropriate fields of a risk register.  Risk Communication  (MA.RC): Information on risks is  recorded and disseminated.  MA.RC-1: Details regarding the  considerations, assumptions, and results of  risk management activity are documented.  Details about risk assessment and risk response are  recorded as supplements to a risk register known as  risk assessment reports and risk detail records,  respectively.  MA.RC-2: Risks that match escalation  criteria are periodically communicated to  higher-level risk managers.  On a monthly basis, an ERM committee receives a  subset of risks from program risk registers as  candidates for addition to the ERR.  MA.RC-3: Risks that match elevation criteria  are transferred to higher-level risk managers  for ownership assignment.  As risk management programs evaluate risks, a risk  matches elevation criteria and is transferred to an  ERM committee for assignment to a Level 1 risk  owner.  MA.RC-4: Risks that match urgent  escalation or elevation criteria are  communicated immediately to higher-level  risk managers.  Risk management programs immediately escalate or  elevate risks to a ERM committee upon identifying that  those risks match criteria for immediate escalation or  elevation.  NIST SP 800-221A ipd  ICT RISK OUTCOMES  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  11  Function Category Subcategory Informative Example  Risk Improvement (MA.IM):  Errors in risk management are  reduced through root-cause  analysis and refinement  implementation.  MA.IM-1: Lessons learned while identifying  and addressing risks are communicated to  leadership.  Risk management programs provide quarterly reports  to leadership on their lessons learned and on trends  they are seeing.  MA.IM-2: Risk management is refined based  on analysis and feedback of circumstances  involving implicit risk acceptance.  Risk management programs are updated to take into  account the results of analyzing implicit risk  acceptance.  315  NIST SP 800-221A ipd  ICT RISK OUTCOMES  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  12  References 316  [CSF] National Institute of Standards and Technology (2018) Framework for Improving 317  Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity, Version 1.1.

The  CSCG’s recommendations underline the importance of Cybersecurity standardisation to complete the  European internal market and to raise the level of Cybersecurity in Europe in general. CSCG  Recommendation #2 proposes a review of the definitions of the term ‘Cybersecurity’. This document  analyses the usage of this term by various stakeholders and reviews standardisation activities in the area of  Cybersecurity, providing an overview of overlaps and gaps in available standards. It has been written by  CSCG and ENISA experts as a response to the Recommendation #2 and forms a logical entity together with  the response to the CSCG Recommendation #1, Governance framework of the European standardisation –  Aligning Policy, Industry and Research, published by ENISA at the same time. Both documents will be  presented for approval at the next CSCG plenary that is scheduled to take place in Berlin, 14-15 January  2016. As a result of the discussion at the CSCG plenary meeting and feedback received revised versions of  the documents might be produced.  In language terms ‘Cybersecurity’ or ‘cyber security’, depending on the organization and the spelling of the  word within its context, is a rather young term. Originated on the term ‘Cyber Space’, the term  ‘Cybersecurity’ was crafted and used by IT professionals, consultants, lobbyists and politics to address  security concerns in the ‘Cyber Space’. But what does this mean? Does ‘Cybersecurity’ only address risks  originating in the ‘Cyber Space’? Does ‘Cyber security’ only consider the protection of virtual assets within  the ‘Cyber Space’? Does ‘Cyber security’ also apply to physical assets, such as Industrial Control Systems,  production lines, power plants, etc. although they are not primarily designed to be in the ‘Cyberspace’?  The first purpose of this document is to raise and describe these diverging understandings in more detail  and provide a guide for determining an appropriate understanding of the term ‘Cybersecurity’ to be used  in the context of the intended use of the stakeholders and policy makers.  ENISA on behalf of the CSCG  puts forward definitions of this term as well as the argumentation supporting its proposals4. The  geographic boundaries are intended to be within the European Union, the member states and the  European Standardization Organizations (ESO).  The second goal of this document is to list organisations taking part in standardisation in the area of  Cybersecurity, provide an overview of activities and identify gaps and overlaps. Within Europe the three  European Standards Organizations, CEN, CENELEC, and ETSI cooperate to try and minimize the amount of  duplication of standards. However, there are many hundreds of groups that work on security or have  security related work streams, and working together between these groups has proved to be difficult. In  many cases gaps in standardization are being addressed, but probably not at a sufficient level of  1 http://ec.europa.eu/information_society/newsroom/cf/dae/document.cfm?doc_id=1667  2 ETSI CEN CENELEC Cybersecurity Coordination Group,  http://www.cencenelec.eu/standards/Sectors/DefenceSecurityPrivacy/Security/Pages/Cybersecurity.aspx  3 Recommendations for a Strategy on European Cybersecurity Standardisation  ftp://ftp.cencenelec.eu/EN/EuropeanStandardization/Sectors/DefenceSecurityPrivacy/Cybersecurity/CSCG_WhitePa per2014.pdf  4 This document is a proposal developed in collaboration with members of the CSCG. It will be presented for approval  at the next CSCG plenary that is scheduled to take place in Berlin, 14-15 January 2016. As a result of the discussion at  the CSCG plenary meeting and feedback received revised versions of the report might be produced.  http://ec.europa.eu/information_society/newsroom/cf/dae/document.cfm?doc_id=1667 http://www.cencenelec.eu/standards/Sectors/DefenceSecurityPrivacy/Security/Pages/Cybersecurity.aspx ftp://ftp.cencenelec.eu/EN/EuropeanStandardization/Sectors/DefenceSecurityPrivacy/Cybersecurity/CSCG_WhitePaper2014.pdf ftp://ftp.cencenelec.eu/EN/EuropeanStandardization/Sectors/DefenceSecurityPrivacy/Cybersecurity/CSCG_WhitePaper2014.pdf  Definition of Cybersecurity – Gaps and overlaps in standardisation  v1.0  |  December 2015  07  commonality in order to insure that enough thorough security exists for new products and services when  they are being developed.  Is there a need for a definition? Cybersecurity is an enveloping term and it is not possible to make a  definition to cover the extent of the things Cybersecurity covers. Therefore, a contextual definition, based  on one that is relevant, fits, and is already used a particular SDO or organisation should be considered. This  document provides recommendations for stakeholders and policymakers, for terminology and for SDOs.  Stakeholders and policymakers should consider the definitions as explained and choose the most  appropriate SDO and definition when considering their requirements. By referencing a specific definition  (and any exceptions to that definition in the requirements), clarity can be maintained.  Cybersecurity shall refer to security of cyberspace, where cyberspace itself refers to the set of links and  relationships between objects that are accessible through a generalised telecommunications network, and  to the set of objects themselves where they present interfaces allowing their remote control, remote  access to data, or their participation in control actions within that Cyberspace.  SDOs are encouraged to embrace the concept of cybersecurity as the provision of security capabilities to  apply to cyberspace. Existing use of the terms under the CIA paradigm when applied to single interfaces  and single classes of object shall explicitly not use the term Cybersecurity.  The best way to ensure that there are no overlaps in standardisation related to Cybersecurity would be for  the SDOs to ensure availability of a catalogue of standardisation activities and to introduce a method of  referring to Standards so that impacts of changes can easily be tracked in dependencies.  There are three strands to standards development – overall requirements for security, privacy, and other  related requirements; overall business requirements, security risks and threats; and security tools and  techniques. We recommend that efforts are made to bring together the various requirements and  initiatives in strand one. More work is required to identify risks and threats in strand two. We should work  on a rationalization of techniques that we are using in strand three towards a smoother integration of  protection into existing and emerging services and infrastructures.  Definition of Cybersecurity – Gaps and overlaps in standardisation  v1.0  |  December 2015  08  1. Introduction  In the Cybersecurity strategy of the European Union, the EU reaffirms the importance of all stakeholders in  the current Internet governance model and supports the multi-stakeholder governance approach. Indeed,  the multi-stakeholder approach is fundamental to the development of successful standards, particularly in  the area of Cybersecurity where public sector requirements are implemented to a large extent by private  sector service providers.  In the field of promoting a Single Market for Cybersecurity products, the Cybersecurity strategy underlines  the importance of the ETSI CEN CENELEC Cybersecurity Coordination Group (CSCG) and ENISA, by stating:  “the Commission will support the development of security standards”; “Such work should build on the on- going standardisation work of the European Standardisation Organisations (CEN, CENELEC and ETSI), of the  Cybersecurity Coordination Group (CSCG) as well as on the expertise of ENISA, the Commission and other  relevant players”.  The Cybersecurity Coordination Group (CSCG) of CEN, CENELEC and ETSI is the only joint group of the three  officially recognised European Standardisation Organisations with a mandate to coordinate Cybersecurity  standards within their organisations. The CSCG was created in late 2011 to provide strategic advice on  standardisation in the field of IT security, Network and Information Security and Cybersecurity.  In response to the European Union’s Cybersecurity Strategy, the CSCG has published a White Paper with  recommendations on digital security. The CSCG’s recommendations underline the importance of  Cybersecurity standardisation to complete the European internal market and to raise the level of  Cybersecurity in Europe in general.  CSCG Recommendation #2 states:  The EC should establish a clear and common understanding of the scope of Cyber Security, based on an  initiative the CSCG plans to launch to clarify the key terms and definitions used in the standardisation of  and communication related to Cyber Security within the European Union. To establish clear understanding,  the CSCG recommends that the European Commission should harmonise its usage of the key terms “Cyber  Security”, “NIS” and “cybercrime” across the EU on the basis of existing definitions. Official communications  currently use all three terms without distinguishing between them, which risks them being interpreted  differently in different EU Member States (or languages). The CSCG recommends that the European  Commission should not limit its clarification to definitions but should also establish an agreed  understanding of the interdependencies and relationships between the three areas in question. The CSCG  also recommends that the Commission should establish and enforce a suitable governance model for the  three areas, with special emphasis on avoiding working in silos on topics that are inherently intertwined.  The CSCG decided at the meeting in Cyprus, 9-10 September 2014 to concentrate on the term  ‘Cybersecurity’.  In language terms ‘Cybersecurity’ or ‘cyber security’, depending on the organization and the spelling of the  word within its context, is a rather young term. Originated on the term ‘Cyber Space’, the term  ‘Cybersecurity’ was crafted and used by IT professionals, consultants, lobbyists and politics to address  security concerns in the ‘Cyber Space’. But what does this mean? Does ‘Cybersecurity’ only address risks  originating in the ‘Cyber Space’? Does ‘Cybersecurity’ only consider the protection of virtual assets within  Definition of Cybersecurity – Gaps and overlaps in standardisation  v1.0  |  December 2015  09  the ‘Cyber Space’? Does ‘Cybersecurity’ also apply to physical assets, such as Industrial Control Systems,  production lines, power plants, etc. although they are not primarily designed to be in the ‘Cyberspace’.  Additional to this controversy, the term ‘Cybersecurity’ is understood by some people as a synonym for the  terms ‘IT security’, ‘ICT security’ or ‘information security’.  Is the ‘Cyber’ in ‘Cybersecurity’ a reference to the origin of the threats or does it apply to the assets being  part of the ‘Cyberspace’ or some combination?  Finding a common understanding is a major challenge and it might not be possible to harmonize the  definition and usage of the term.  The purpose of this document is:   to raise and describe these diverging notions in more detail and provide a guide to determine an  appropriate understanding of the term ‘Cybersecurity’ to be used in the context of the intended  use of the stakeholders and policy makers.  ENISA on behalf of the CSCG will put forward  definitions of this term as well as the argumentation supporting its proposals5. The geographic  boundaries are intended to be within the European Union, its member states and the European  Standardization Organizations (ESO).   to list organisations taking part in standardisation in the area of Cybersecurity, providing an  overview of activities and identifies gaps and overlaps. Within Europe the three European  Standards Organizations, CEN, CENELEC, and ETSI cooperate to try and minimize the amount of  duplication of standards. However, there are hundreds of groups that work on security or have  security related work activities, and working together between these groups has proved to be  difficult. In many cases gaps in standardization are being addressed, but probably not at a  sufficient level of commonality in order to insure that enough thorough security exists for new  products and services when they are being developed.  5 This document is a proposal developed in collaboration with members of the CSCG. It will be presented for approval  at the next CSCG plenary that is scheduled to take place in Berlin, 14-15 January 2016. As a result of the discussion at  the CSCG plenary meeting and feedback received revised versions of the report might be produced.  Definition of Cybersecurity – Gaps and overlaps in standardisation  v1.0  |  December 2015  10  2. Common understanding of Cybersecurity  The term cyber and its associated terms cyberspace (any spelling) and cybersecurity (any spelling) have  drifted from the world of the arts and into the mainstream. For many years we have seen BBC’s fictional Dr  Who battle against the cybermen starting with their debut in 1966, we have William Gibson’s introduction  of the concept of cyberspace in his novel “Neuromancer” where he defines Cyberspace as “… a consensual  hallucination experienced daily by billions of legitimate operators, in every nation, by children being taught  mathematical concepts... A graphic representation of data abstracted from the banks of every computer in  the human system. Unthinkable complexity. Lines of light ranged in the non-space of the mind, clusters and  constellations of data. Like city lights, receding”, and we have dancers in the 1960s using the term to refer  to a half improvised free dance. Even prior to the term cyber in these forms we see use of the term  cybernetics developed by Norbert Wiener in his book “Cybernetics or Control and Communication in the  Animal and the Machine” (MIT Press, 1948) where the term in used in reference to the control of complex  systems in the animal world and in mechanical networks, in particular self-regulating control systems. This  is a snapshot of the long cultural background through which the term has become commonplace, and  inevitably multi-nuanced.  Preceding Gibson’s use of the term cyberspace, the Control Data Corporation marketed a line of  computers as “cyber” and in doing so fixed the term to computing and technology and moved the term  further from its suggested Greek root of meaning “skilled in steering or governing”, a root that Wiener’s  use of the term is much more closely aligned to.  During the latter part of the 1980s and throughout the  1990s cyber was used as a prefix in many areas: Cybercrime (crime involving computers), cyberpunk (the  genre of fiction that Gibson and others belong to), cybergoth (music fans who share characteristics of the  goth movement with electronic music and decoration), cyberbullying (bullying using the internet and social  media), cybersex (sex using the internet and electronically controlled tools), cyberwarfare (acts of war  carried out across the internet against human and non-human targets) and so on. A plea was made to stop  the use of cyber as a general purpose prefix but that appears to have fallen on deaf ears. The end result is  that removing the prefix and accepting that today the internet and electronic communication and control  are endemic really means that cyber-security has the same difficulty in finding a simple definition as  security.  Even the correct spelling of ‘Cybersecurity’ is controversial and differing. Some publications use a single  word ‘Cybersecurity’, others prefer a term consisting of two words ‘Cyber Security’. To complicate things,  even the capitalization is disputed – in many respects this mimics the issues surrounding the correct  spelling and capitalisation of the term email (or e-mail, or E-mail, or E-Mail …).  In common parlance, ‘Cybersecurity’ is defined by The Oxford English Dictionary as “The state of being  protected against the criminal or unauthorized use of electronic data, or the measures taken to achieve  this”. Following this interpretation, only the unauthorized and criminal misuse of information is covered.  But the question remains, what about operational errors? Is the protection against a human error to  provide essential services in the ‘Cyberspace’ not within the scope of ‘Cybersecurity’? The term  ‘information security’ on the contrary includes the protection against such non-malicious disruptions.  Looking further into the definition of The Oxford English Dictionary, the question comes up about the  manipulation of physical assets, such as production lines, utilities, etc. Is this covered by this definition?  Definition of Cybersecurity – Gaps and overlaps in standardisation  v1.0  |  December 2015  11  However in the Standards community, the definition is significantly wider to include protection against a  variety of risks for organisations and data, especially when ‘Cybersecurity’ is considered a synonym for  ‘Information security’.  The issue is even further compounded by the popularisation of the term in the mass media. The mass  media commonly use it as a catch-all and ‘dumbed-down’ phrase that often attributes anything and  everything that can disrupt computers as threats to ‘Cybersecurity’.  In the military environments, organizations approach the term ‘Cybersecurity’ from an even wider and  much more strategic perspective, using the term ‘Cybersecurity’ in connection with the terms “cyber  defence” and ‘cyber war’.  Figure (1) illustrates the different domains within the term ‘Cybersecurity’.  Figure 1: Different domains of Cybersecurity  In Figure 1, the domains are referred to as follows:  Communications  Security  Protection against a threat to the technical infrastructure of a  cyber system which may lead to an alteration of its  characteristics in order to carry out activities which were not  intended by its owners, designers or users.  Operations  Security  Protection against the intended corruption of procedures or  workflows which will have results that were unintended by its  owners, designers or users.  Information  Security  Protection against the threat of theft, deletion or alteration of  stored or transmitted data within a cyber system.  Definition of Cybersecurity – Gaps and overlaps in standardisation  v1.0  |  December 2015  12  Physical Security  Protection against physical threats that can influence or affect  the well-being of a cyber system. Examples could be physical  access to servers, insertion of malicious hardware into a  network, or coercion of users or their families.  Public/National  Security  Protection against a threat whose origin is from within  cyberspace, but may threaten either physical or cyber assets in  a way which will have a political, military or strategic gain for  the attacker. Examples could be ‘Stuxnet’ or wide-scale DOS  attacks on utilities, communications financial system or other  critical public or industrial infrastructures.  This document specifically restricts its scope to Cybersecurity issues which are not specifically related to  aspects of Public/National or Physical Security.  Definition of Cybersecurity – Gaps and overlaps in standardisation  v1.0  |  December 2015  13  3. Terminology of Cybersecurity in documentation  Composition of the Term  A deconstruction of the components that make up the definition of the ‘Cybersecurity’ domain is  illustrated below.  This diagram looks at the various aspects of the definition which are referred to and  implied when the definition is used by stakeholders.  This wide range of components adds to the wide variations in meaning of the term and has a potential to  obscure the true scope of a particular Cybersecurity action or intention.  Figure 2: Components constituting the definition of Cybersecurity  The following is a detailed description of the origin of the definition described in figure 2.  Criteria Explanation  Type of Document Obligatory: A document that has a definition that is founded in law, regulations or  mandatory standards.  Voluntary: A document that has a definition that is founded in agreed best- practice or reputable recommendations  CIA Based on CIA: The definition of ‘Cybersecurity’ uses and addresses the terms  ‘Confidentiality’, ‘Integrity’ and ‘Availability’  Without CIA: The definition of ‘Cybersecurity’ does not refer to, or include the  issues of ‘Confidentiality’, ‘Integrity’ and ‘Availability’.  Spelling The form of spelling that is being used. This provides consistency across a  definition and its use.  Organization The nature of the publishing organization may influence the factors or domains  that are addressed in the definition. This may influence the stakeholder sectore  applicability of the definition and therefore its usefulness.  Meaning of ‘Cyber’ The definition refers to the origin of a threat that is introduced via Cyberspace  rather than a physical attack.  Definition of Cybersecurity – Gaps and overlaps in standardisation  v1.0  |  December 2015  14  The definition looks only at targets that reduce the trustworthiness of a system or  process rather than a device that is controlled via a system originating in the  Cyberspace.  Types of  threatened assets  Related to the above, the class of the threatened system that is covered in the  definition of Cybersecurity’.  Motivation of  Threat Source  The definition may address the motivation of the threat, whether by intent, for  example criminal’, or unintentional, as a result of a by-product of another action.  Origin of Threat  Source  The definition may differentiate the origin of the threat. And may only consider  protection against threats arising from the ‘Cyber Space’, aka Internet and are  solely network based. Alternatively the definition may address the protection of  Information Systems from local threats such as ‘insider-threats’. Again,  the  definition may also address protection against physical attacks on the facility  hosting Information Systems.  Terminology as defined by dictionaries  3.2.1 Oxford  The Oxford Dictionaries – Online6 defines ‘cybersecurity’ as: The state of being protected against the  criminal or unauthorized use of electronic data, or the measures taken to achieve this.  3.2.2 Merriam Webster  The Merriam – Webster7 defines ‘cybersecurity’ as: Measures taken to protect a computer or computer  system (as on the Internet) against unauthorized access or attack  Terminology used by organisations  The organisations mentioned below use the term ‘Cybersecurity’ in various contexts. They have been ordered  according to their relevance for the European standardisation.  3.3.1 ETSI  Term Cybersecurity  Organization ETSI TC Cyber  Document  Number  Not defined other than in the Terms of Reference of the ETSI Technical Committee  CYBER  Document  Title  Terms of Reference for ETSI TC Cyber  Publishing  Date  n/a  Definition n/a  Details In ETSI TC CYBER has addressed Cybersecurity as domain with many facets and has  identified both responsibilities and areas of activity to be undertaken across ETSI and in  the technical body to address these.  The main responsibilities of ETSI TC CYBER are:   To act as the ETSI centre of expertise in the area of Cybersecurity   Advise other ETSI TCs and ISGs with the development of Cybersecurity  requirements  6 http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/cybersecurity?q=cyber+security  7 http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/cybersecurity  http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/cybersecurity?q=cyber+security http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/cybersecurity  Definition of Cybersecurity – Gaps and overlaps in standardisation  v1.0  |  December 2015  15   To develop and maintain the Standards, Specifications and other deliverables to  support the development and implementation of Cybersecurity standardization  within ETSI   To collect and specify Cybersecurity requirements from relevant stakeholders   To identify gaps where existing standards do not meet the requirements and  provide specifications and standards to fill these gaps, without duplication of  work in other ETSI committees and partnership projects   To ensure that appropriate Standards are developed within ETSI in order to  meet these requirements   To perform identified work as sub-contracted from ETSI Projects and ETSI  Partnership Projects   To coordinate work in ETSI with external groups such as Cybersecurity  Coordination group in CEN CENELEC and ENISA   To answer to policy requests related to Cybersecurity, and security in broad  sense in the ICT sector.  These areas of responsibility are loosely mapped to “Areas of activity” that TC CYBER  will address in close co-operation with relevant standards activities within and outside  ETSI.  The activities of ETSI TC CYBER include the following broad areas:   Cybersecurity   Security of infrastructures, devices, services and protocols   Security advice, guidance and operational security requirements to users,  manufacturers and network and infrastructure operators   Security tools and techniques to ensure security   Creation of security specifications and alignment with work done in other TCs.

For the purposes of this  consideration we look at standardisation aspects for the provision of security features (primitives,  protocols, services), for the reporting of security threat information, and for the organisational  management to give security assurance.  4.2.1 Security feature provision  Most technical standards bodies have prepared standards for the provision of sector/technology specific  security features. As an example the 3G PLMN has a set of standards covering authentication of terminals,  provision of air interface confidentiality (on the risk analysis result that the open air-interface is the  interface that is the most at risk), provision of signalling and data integrity validation services, of key  management for the cryptographic algorithms and the definition of the algorithms themselves including  addressing the export control of them.  4.2.2 Security assurance  The security assurance field is dominated, in standards, by the Common Criteria initiative (ISO 15408) and  by ongoing work in the 3GPP community. However in addition to this formal work a number of initiatives  are led by industry with product quality testing by Apple for example covering product security, by Google  for Android, and by Microsoft for the Windows platform.  It should be noted that it is not obligatory to adhere to any security assurance criteria and thus many  products have unverified security capability.  4.2.3 Security threat sharing  Sharing of threat information, current attack patterns, software vulnerabilities and so forth has been  standardised in process through the establishment of a network of CSIRTs (Computer Security Incident  Response Teams) and been augmented by the establishment and development of a number of initiatives  such as STIX/TAXII, CyBox, MISPs (Malware information Sharing Platform). Many of these initiatives are  standardised with STIX/TAXII/CybOX recently moved to the OASIS standards track (and this will be closely  followed by, amongst others, ETSI CYBER).  4.2.4 Organisational management for secure operations  The outstanding example in this domain is the ISO 27000 series of guides and recommendations. Within  this series ISO/IEC 27001 is a certification standard that is designed to help an organization to define a  framework for managing Information security more effectively which then points to ISO/IEC 17799 which  lists controls and interpretation for the same. For more specific IT functions the COBIT guides add  additional controls for implementing IT Governance within an organization, and ITIL extends these slightly  in the domain of IT Service Management covered by ISO standards ISO 20000-1 (guidance) and ISO 20000- 2 (certifiable standard).  Many individual nations have taken and either endorsed the ISO specifications as above or extended them  (noting that the ISO specifications themselves have been derived from a large number of national and  international security frameworks).  Definition of Cybersecurity – Gaps and overlaps in standardisation  v1.0  |  December 2015  24  5. Overlaps in standardisation efforts  Standardisation activities take place in international, national, and industry-based forums. Within Europe  the three European Standards Organizations, CEN, CENELEC, and ETSI cooperate to try and minimize the  amount of duplication of standards. Many groups have liaisons and co-operation agreements within the  various groups. However, there are many hundreds of groups that work on security or have security  related work streams, and working together between these groups has proved to be difficult.  There are many examples of duplication of work between standards organizations: For example on the  Internet of things we have work undertaken by ITU Study Group 209, oneM2M10 and also specific work  items in many other groups such as those looking at intelligent transport, Smart energy, Smart cities, and  many other related activities.  Similar overlaps, including those that are security related occur in topics such as Mobile radio between  3GPP, some of the ITU work, and also work within IETF on protocols.  Over the years many papers and efforts have been produced highlighting works within standards  organizations in order to highlight the overlaps. For example ITU has a Standards Roadmap11 detailing  different standards works, and some of the different and overlapping activities within organizations. The  Roadmap was launched by ITU Study Group 17, and became a joint effort in January 2007, when the  European Network and Information Security Agency (ENISA) and the Network and Information Security  Steering Group (NISSG) joined the initiative, but it suffers from the immense effort needed to keep it  current. A recent contribution to TC CYBER12 has also highlighted standards in the Global Cybersecurity  Ecosystem, and work going on worldwide in many areas.  Although this overlap is inevitable, organizations must ensure that they have sufficient contact between  themselves to minimize the impact, as the number of experts in the security area capable of working on  the subjects is necessarily limited.  When standards are being formulated, they should draw upon existing standards without change, or if any  changes are required, they should be fed back into those existing standards. Theree is a serious impact if  one standard draws directly from another standards, then changes in one standard are not reflected in  others.  The best way to ensure lack of overlaps in Cybersecurity standardisation would be for the SDOs to:   Ensure the availability of a Standards Catalogue, drawing upon the ITU, ENISA and NISSG initiative  above.   Introduce a method of referring to Standards so that impacts of changes can easily be tracked in  dependencies.  9 ITU-T SG20: IoT and its applications including smart cities and communities (SC&C) - http://www.itu.int/en/ITU- T/studygroups/2013-2016/20/Pages/default.aspx  10 OneM2m Standards for M2M and the Internet of Things http://www.onem2m.org/  11 ITU Standards Roadmap - http://www.itu.int/en/ITU-T/studygroups/2013-2016/17/ict/Pages/default.aspx  12 Global Cybersecurity Ecosystem – ETSI TR 103 306 -  https://portal.etsi.org/webapp/WorkProgram/Report_WorkItem.asp?wki_id=45906  Definition of Cybersecurity – Gaps and overlaps in standardisation  v1.0  |  December 2015  25  6. Gaps in standardisation activities  Overall situation  In some areas of standardisation, overlaps exists (like e.g. competing organizations as well as competing  technical standardization approaches) and will probably persist due to the political interests of commercial  as well as non-commercial organizations. Keeping in mind that monocultures usually lead to lower  progress while competition usually fosters evolution, the fact of overlap itself might not be that much of  an issue but mapping this to a limited amount of available resources (to e.g. participate in the process of  standardization), a very dynamic market with limited ability as well as limited motivation to quickly adopt  standards without “warranty” on sustainability could make the issue significant.  Some existing and well-accepted international standards (e.g. ISO/IEC 27035) are not reflected in European  norms, so based on careful evaluation and counseling with relevant stakeholders an easy solution could be  to adopt and reflect them into European norms where feasible. One should not focuson operational  aspects only but drive the overall cybersecurity standardization approach on strategic level.  Looking at it from such a perspective, the first gap in standardization to approach would be the lack of a  commonly accepted and formally standardized definition of the cyber domain. We also lack field-proven  standards on how to timely and practically evaluate the quality and effectiveness of modern technologies  that aim to provide protection against attacks.  Looking at the dynamically changing landscape of tools and technologies, the lack of applicable standards  leads to the situation where technology vendors keep proprietary solutions, while consumers are left  without transparency on their systems. Classic approaches to verification of technical requirements (e.g.  Common Criteria Protection Profiles) are complex and hard to keep-up with in dynamic markets,  technologies and changing threat landscape.  There are several globally acting large corporations based or originating in Europe, but the majority of the  economic ecosystem is made of mid-sized and small companies. From the point of view of the type of  business Europe has a globally strong position in Aerospace, Automotive, Chemicals, Defence, Engineering,  High Tech, Pharmaceutics and related goods and services. Some of these are ran under national and  international regulations and observe standards applicable to their fields. However, typical industry  regulations do not cover Cybersecurity directly, but through rules on technical and ethical compliance and  code of conduct of business.  Privacy is one of the core European basic rights. It is evident that especially this aspect seems to have been  left-out in the technical standards. Some industry practice standards (e.g. PCI DSS) as well as specific  requirements exist, but this is not sufficient to enable neutral evaluation of technologies nor services to  the national or European privacy regulations.  It is observed that although the market demand is shifting from pure technology towards so-called  Managed Security Services, there are yet no sustainable and accepted industry or conceptual standards  available on this topic. Some national security authorities (like French ANSSI, German BSI and British CESG)  started to work and pilot local schemes, partly overlapping but also following sometimes different  approaches.  Definition of Cybersecurity – Gaps and overlaps in standardisation  v1.0  |  December 2015  26  Mitigating the gaps  In many cases gaps in standardization are being addressed, but probably not at a sufficient level of  commonality in order to ensure that new products and services benefit from an appropriate attention to  security issues when they are being developed.  Areas in which there are many standards for example include:   Identity and associated mechanisms such as frameworks and architectures (e.g. ISO/IEC 24760),  identification and authorization protocols, (e.g. OpenID, OAuth, LID), Smart cards. However for  areas like privacy-friendly authentication the more technical standards still don’t exist.   Confidentiality, with multiple algorithms and key distribution techniques,   Integrity protection, some of which had to be modified when found to be insecure.   Privacy and related mechanisms, which exist in many places, such as those from the GSMA and  many other bodies: ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 27, W3C, OECD and The Information Commissioner’s Office in  The United Kingdom.  It is probably true and that there will never be universal systems for the design of security into systems,  products and services, and it can be argued that a diverse ecosystem of security techniques actually adds  to the security protecting against surprising vulnerabilities of specific techniques. Nevertheless when new  systems are being designed then it is vitally important that minimal changes, where possible, are made to  existing protocols.  There is also overlap between standardisation activities such as the convergence between safety and  security in critical infrastructure, the aeronautics industry and transport.  There are three strands to standards development, which we should consider:   The first strand is setting the overall requirements for security, privacy, and other related security  requirements. There are many examples of these from ISO/IEC JTC 1, NIST, and other similar  frameworks. What is lacking is a coherent method for bringing together these various frameworks,  so when a System, Service or Product has been developed, then the appropriate framework can be  used. The number of these frameworks should be minimised or, at least, the relationships  between them need to be better understood. There are also of course legal requirements, such as  those for Data protection, law enforcement, and Business such as trading information, which may  be sensitive. These requirements need also to be put into the framework.   The second strand is concerned with looking at the overall business and identifying the security  risks and threats. Too often security products and services are developed without understanding  these important issues, and without considering the flexibility (such as replacing algorithms) and  life cycle requirements from start to withdrawal from service.   The third strand is that of security technical implementation, this is partly well covered by the  various tools and techniques that exist. However there are many of these, and it would be useful  to consider how these could be reduced to enable reuse when they are required. In this way they  can more easily be built into Products and services and present a consistent Interface for the  customer and operator. Also missing are standards and guidelines to integrate the tools and  techniques towards systems, that can provide secure infrastructure services, e.g. as a basis for an  infrastructure initiative to provide cryptographically protected end-to-end- encrypted  communication to normal (non-expert) users. Also there is a lack of system standards for secure  and trustworthy (device) platforms, that can function as terminals for end-to-end protection  Definition of Cybersecurity – Gaps and overlaps in standardisation  v1.0  |  December 2015  27  usable by non-experts. Both are of importance if these services are to be made available in an  affordable manner to ordinary citizens and small businesses, e.g. via universal service provision.  It is probably true to say that there are many different standards on several technologies available; what  needs to be addressed is the reduction of the proliferation of very similar but incompatible tools and  techniques and the provision of essential services to non-expert users.  We would recommend that efforts are made to bring together the various requirements and initiatives in  strand one.  More work is required to identify risks and threats in strand two. We should work on a rationalization of  techniques that we are using in strand three towards a smoother integration of protection into existing  and emerging services and infrastructures.  One of the conclusions of the analysis of the existing approaches on standardization is that the landscape  is very scattered, from e.g. process-related standards down to e.g. single technology standards without  overall integration.  Definition of Cybersecurity – Gaps and overlaps in standardisation  v1.0  |  December 2015  28  7. Recommendations  Is there a need for a definition?  There does not need to be a definition for Cybersecurity in the conventional sense that we tend to apply to  definitions for simple things like authentication of an identity (a security mechanism allowing the  verification of the provided identity). The problem is that Cybersecurity is an enveloping term and it is not  possible to make a definition to cover the extent of the things Cybersecurity covers.  Therefore, a contextual definition, based on one that is relevant, fits, and is already used a particular SDO  or organisation should be considered. Concrete examples of such usage have been provided in Section 3.3.  For stakeholders and policymakers  Stakeholders should have an easy to understand guide so that they may refer, unambiguously to the scope  of Cybersecurity that they intend. Because of the breadth of the topic, as described, SDOs and other  organizations all have differing definitions.  Stakeholders and policymakers should consider the definitions as explained and choose the most  appropriate SDO and definition when considering their requirements. By referencing a specific definition  (and any exceptions to that definition in the requirements), clarity can be maintained.  Based on the previous summary table in chapter 3.4, it is possible to use the following graphic  representations as a guide to selection of the correct definition and associated spelling. In the following  figures, fields marked in red represent the components of definitions used in specific context. The table  (Figure 8) depicts comparison between the contexts.

Cybersecurity shall  therefore encompass the CIA paradigm for relationships and objects within cyberspace and extend that  same CIA paradigm to address protection of privacy for legal entities (people and corporations), and to  address resilience (recovery from attack).  For SDOs  SDOs are encouraged to embrace the concept of cybersecurity as the provision of security capabilities to  apply to cyberspace. Existing use of the terms under the CIA paradigm when applied to single interfaces  and single classes of object shall explicitly not use the term Cybersecurity.

The  CSCG’s recommendations underline the importance of Cybersecurity standardisation to complete the  European internal market and to raise the level of Cybersecurity in Europe in general. CSCG  Recommendation #2 proposes a review of the definitions of the term ‘Cybersecurity’. This document  analyses the usage of this term by various stakeholders and reviews standardisation activities in the area of  Cybersecurity, providing an overview of overlaps and gaps in available standards. It has been written by  CSCG and ENISA experts as a response to the Recommendation #2 and forms a logical entity together with  the response to the CSCG Recommendation #1, Governance framework of the European standardisation –  Aligning Policy, Industry and Research, published by ENISA at the same time. Both documents will be  presented for approval at the next CSCG plenary that is scheduled to take place in Berlin, 14-15 January  2016. As a result of the discussion at the CSCG plenary meeting and feedback received revised versions of  the documents might be produced.  In language terms ‘Cybersecurity’ or ‘cyber security’, depending on the organization and the spelling of the  word within its context, is a rather young term. Originated on the term ‘Cyber Space’, the term  ‘Cybersecurity’ was crafted and used by IT professionals, consultants, lobbyists and politics to address  security concerns in the ‘Cyber Space’. But what does this mean? Does ‘Cybersecurity’ only address risks  originating in the ‘Cyber Space’? Does ‘Cyber security’ only consider the protection of virtual assets within  the ‘Cyber Space’? Does ‘Cyber security’ also apply to physical assets, such as Industrial Control Systems,  production lines, power plants, etc. although they are not primarily designed to be in the ‘Cyberspace’?  The first purpose of this document is to raise and describe these diverging understandings in more detail  and provide a guide for determining an appropriate understanding of the term ‘Cybersecurity’ to be used  in the context of the intended use of the stakeholders and policy makers.  ENISA on behalf of the CSCG  puts forward definitions of this term as well as the argumentation supporting its proposals4. The  geographic boundaries are intended to be within the European Union, the member states and the  European Standardization Organizations (ESO).  The second goal of this document is to list organisations taking part in standardisation in the area of  Cybersecurity, provide an overview of activities and identify gaps and overlaps. Within Europe the three  European Standards Organizations, CEN, CENELEC, and ETSI cooperate to try and minimize the amount of  duplication of standards. However, there are many hundreds of groups that work on security or have  security related work streams, and working together between these groups has proved to be difficult. In  many cases gaps in standardization are being addressed, but probably not at a sufficient level of  1 http://ec.europa.eu/information_society/newsroom/cf/dae/document.cfm?doc_id=1667  2 ETSI CEN CENELEC Cybersecurity Coordination Group,  http://www.cencenelec.eu/standards/Sectors/DefenceSecurityPrivacy/Security/Pages/Cybersecurity.aspx  3 Recommendations for a Strategy on European Cybersecurity Standardisation  ftp://ftp.cencenelec.eu/EN/EuropeanStandardization/Sectors/DefenceSecurityPrivacy/Cybersecurity/CSCG_WhitePa per2014.pdf  4 This document is a proposal developed in collaboration with members of the CSCG. It will be presented for approval  at the next CSCG plenary that is scheduled to take place in Berlin, 14-15 January 2016. As a result of the discussion at  the CSCG plenary meeting and feedback received revised versions of the report might be produced.  http://ec.europa.eu/information_society/newsroom/cf/dae/document.cfm?doc_id=1667 http://www.cencenelec.eu/standards/Sectors/DefenceSecurityPrivacy/Security/Pages/Cybersecurity.aspx ftp://ftp.cencenelec.eu/EN/EuropeanStandardization/Sectors/DefenceSecurityPrivacy/Cybersecurity/CSCG_WhitePaper2014.pdf ftp://ftp.cencenelec.eu/EN/EuropeanStandardization/Sectors/DefenceSecurityPrivacy/Cybersecurity/CSCG_WhitePaper2014.pdf  Definition of Cybersecurity – Gaps and overlaps in standardisation  v1.0  |  December 2015  07  commonality in order to insure that enough thorough security exists for new products and services when  they are being developed.  Is there a need for a definition? Cybersecurity is an enveloping term and it is not possible to make a  definition to cover the extent of the things Cybersecurity covers. Therefore, a contextual definition, based  on one that is relevant, fits, and is already used a particular SDO or organisation should be considered. This  document provides recommendations for stakeholders and policymakers, for terminology and for SDOs.  Stakeholders and policymakers should consider the definitions as explained and choose the most  appropriate SDO and definition when considering their requirements. By referencing a specific definition  (and any exceptions to that definition in the requirements), clarity can be maintained.  Cybersecurity shall refer to security of cyberspace, where cyberspace itself refers to the set of links and  relationships between objects that are accessible through a generalised telecommunications network, and  to the set of objects themselves where they present interfaces allowing their remote control, remote  access to data, or their participation in control actions within that Cyberspace.  SDOs are encouraged to embrace the concept of cybersecurity as the provision of security capabilities to  apply to cyberspace. Existing use of the terms under the CIA paradigm when applied to single interfaces  and single classes of object shall explicitly not use the term Cybersecurity.  The best way to ensure that there are no overlaps in standardisation related to Cybersecurity would be for  the SDOs to ensure availability of a catalogue of standardisation activities and to introduce a method of  referring to Standards so that impacts of changes can easily be tracked in dependencies.  There are three strands to standards development – overall requirements for security, privacy, and other  related requirements; overall business requirements, security risks and threats; and security tools and  techniques. We recommend that efforts are made to bring together the various requirements and  initiatives in strand one. More work is required to identify risks and threats in strand two. We should work  on a rationalization of techniques that we are using in strand three towards a smoother integration of  protection into existing and emerging services and infrastructures.  Definition of Cybersecurity – Gaps and overlaps in standardisation  v1.0  |  December 2015  08  1. Introduction  In the Cybersecurity strategy of the European Union, the EU reaffirms the importance of all stakeholders in  the current Internet governance model and supports the multi-stakeholder governance approach. Indeed,  the multi-stakeholder approach is fundamental to the development of successful standards, particularly in  the area of Cybersecurity where public sector requirements are implemented to a large extent by private  sector service providers.  In the field of promoting a Single Market for Cybersecurity products, the Cybersecurity strategy underlines  the importance of the ETSI CEN CENELEC Cybersecurity Coordination Group (CSCG) and ENISA, by stating:  “the Commission will support the development of security standards”; “Such work should build on the on- going standardisation work of the European Standardisation Organisations (CEN, CENELEC and ETSI), of the  Cybersecurity Coordination Group (CSCG) as well as on the expertise of ENISA, the Commission and other  relevant players”.  The Cybersecurity Coordination Group (CSCG) of CEN, CENELEC and ETSI is the only joint group of the three  officially recognised European Standardisation Organisations with a mandate to coordinate Cybersecurity  standards within their organisations. The CSCG was created in late 2011 to provide strategic advice on  standardisation in the field of IT security, Network and Information Security and Cybersecurity.  In response to the European Union’s Cybersecurity Strategy, the CSCG has published a White Paper with  recommendations on digital security. The CSCG’s recommendations underline the importance of  Cybersecurity standardisation to complete the European internal market and to raise the level of  Cybersecurity in Europe in general.  CSCG Recommendation #2 states:  The EC should establish a clear and common understanding of the scope of Cyber Security, based on an  initiative the CSCG plans to launch to clarify the key terms and definitions used in the standardisation of  and communication related to Cyber Security within the European Union. To establish clear understanding,  the CSCG recommends that the European Commission should harmonise its usage of the key terms “Cyber  Security”, “NIS” and “cybercrime” across the EU on the basis of existing definitions. Official communications  currently use all three terms without distinguishing between them, which risks them being interpreted  differently in different EU Member States (or languages). The CSCG recommends that the European  Commission should not limit its clarification to definitions but should also establish an agreed  understanding of the interdependencies and relationships between the three areas in question. The CSCG  also recommends that the Commission should establish and enforce a suitable governance model for the  three areas, with special emphasis on avoiding working in silos on topics that are inherently intertwined.  The CSCG decided at the meeting in Cyprus, 9-10 September 2014 to concentrate on the term  ‘Cybersecurity’.  In language terms ‘Cybersecurity’ or ‘cyber security’, depending on the organization and the spelling of the  word within its context, is a rather young term. Originated on the term ‘Cyber Space’, the term  ‘Cybersecurity’ was crafted and used by IT professionals, consultants, lobbyists and politics to address  security concerns in the ‘Cyber Space’. But what does this mean? Does ‘Cybersecurity’ only address risks  originating in the ‘Cyber Space’? Does ‘Cybersecurity’ only consider the protection of virtual assets within  Definition of Cybersecurity – Gaps and overlaps in standardisation  v1.0  |  December 2015  09  the ‘Cyber Space’? Does ‘Cybersecurity’ also apply to physical assets, such as Industrial Control Systems,  production lines, power plants, etc. although they are not primarily designed to be in the ‘Cyberspace’.  Additional to this controversy, the term ‘Cybersecurity’ is understood by some people as a synonym for the  terms ‘IT security’, ‘ICT security’ or ‘information security’.  Is the ‘Cyber’ in ‘Cybersecurity’ a reference to the origin of the threats or does it apply to the assets being  part of the ‘Cyberspace’ or some combination?  Finding a common understanding is a major challenge and it might not be possible to harmonize the  definition and usage of the term.  The purpose of this document is:   to raise and describe these diverging notions in more detail and provide a guide to determine an  appropriate understanding of the term ‘Cybersecurity’ to be used in the context of the intended  use of the stakeholders and policy makers.  ENISA on behalf of the CSCG will put forward  definitions of this term as well as the argumentation supporting its proposals5. The geographic  boundaries are intended to be within the European Union, its member states and the European  Standardization Organizations (ESO).   to list organisations taking part in standardisation in the area of Cybersecurity, providing an  overview of activities and identifies gaps and overlaps. Within Europe the three European  Standards Organizations, CEN, CENELEC, and ETSI cooperate to try and minimize the amount of  duplication of standards.

In many cases gaps in standardization are being addressed, but probably not at a  sufficient level of commonality in order to insure that enough thorough security exists for new  products and services when they are being developed.  5 This document is a proposal developed in collaboration with members of the CSCG.

Definition of Cybersecurity – Gaps and overlaps in standardisation  v1.0  |  December 2015  10  2. Common understanding of Cybersecurity  The term cyber and its associated terms cyberspace (any spelling) and cybersecurity (any spelling) have  drifted from the world of the arts and into the mainstream. For many years we have seen BBC’s fictional Dr  Who battle against the cybermen starting with their debut in 1966, we have William Gibson’s introduction  of the concept of cyberspace in his novel “Neuromancer” where he defines Cyberspace as “… a consensual  hallucination experienced daily by billions of legitimate operators, in every nation, by children being taught  mathematical concepts... A graphic representation of data abstracted from the banks of every computer in  the human system. Unthinkable complexity. Lines of light ranged in the non-space of the mind, clusters and  constellations of data. Like city lights, receding”, and we have dancers in the 1960s using the term to refer  to a half improvised free dance. Even prior to the term cyber in these forms we see use of the term  cybernetics developed by Norbert Wiener in his book “Cybernetics or Control and Communication in the  Animal and the Machine” (MIT Press, 1948) where the term in used in reference to the control of complex  systems in the animal world and in mechanical networks, in particular self-regulating control systems. This  is a snapshot of the long cultural background through which the term has become commonplace, and  inevitably multi-nuanced.  Preceding Gibson’s use of the term cyberspace, the Control Data Corporation marketed a line of  computers as “cyber” and in doing so fixed the term to computing and technology and moved the term  further from its suggested Greek root of meaning “skilled in steering or governing”, a root that Wiener’s  use of the term is much more closely aligned to.  During the latter part of the 1980s and throughout the  1990s cyber was used as a prefix in many areas: Cybercrime (crime involving computers), cyberpunk (the  genre of fiction that Gibson and others belong to), cybergoth (music fans who share characteristics of the  goth movement with electronic music and decoration), cyberbullying (bullying using the internet and social  media), cybersex (sex using the internet and electronically controlled tools), cyberwarfare (acts of war  carried out across the internet against human and non-human targets) and so on. A plea was made to stop  the use of cyber as a general purpose prefix but that appears to have fallen on deaf ears. The end result is  that removing the prefix and accepting that today the internet and electronic communication and control  are endemic really means that cyber-security has the same difficulty in finding a simple definition as  security.  Even the correct spelling of ‘Cybersecurity’ is controversial and differing. Some publications use a single  word ‘Cybersecurity’, others prefer a term consisting of two words ‘Cyber Security’. To complicate things,  even the capitalization is disputed – in many respects this mimics the issues surrounding the correct  spelling and capitalisation of the term email (or e-mail, or E-mail, or E-Mail …).  In common parlance, ‘Cybersecurity’ is defined by The Oxford English Dictionary as “The state of being  protected against the criminal or unauthorized use of electronic data, or the measures taken to achieve  this”. Following this interpretation, only the unauthorized and criminal misuse of information is covered.  But the question remains, what about operational errors? Is the protection against a human error to  provide essential services in the ‘Cyberspace’ not within the scope of ‘Cybersecurity’? The term  ‘information security’ on the contrary includes the protection against such non-malicious disruptions.  Looking further into the definition of The Oxford English Dictionary, the question comes up about the  manipulation of physical assets, such as production lines, utilities, etc. Is this covered by this definition?  Definition of Cybersecurity – Gaps and overlaps in standardisation  v1.0  |  December 2015  11  However in the Standards community, the definition is significantly wider to include protection against a  variety of risks for organisations and data, especially when ‘Cybersecurity’ is considered a synonym for  ‘Information security’.  The issue is even further compounded by the popularisation of the term in the mass media. The mass  media commonly use it as a catch-all and ‘dumbed-down’ phrase that often attributes anything and  everything that can disrupt computers as threats to ‘Cybersecurity’.  In the military environments, organizations approach the term ‘Cybersecurity’ from an even wider and  much more strategic perspective, using the term ‘Cybersecurity’ in connection with the terms “cyber  defence” and ‘cyber war’.  Figure (1) illustrates the different domains within the term ‘Cybersecurity’.  Figure 1: Different domains of Cybersecurity  In Figure 1, the domains are referred to as follows:  Communications  Security  Protection against a threat to the technical infrastructure of a  cyber system which may lead to an alteration of its  characteristics in order to carry out activities which were not  intended by its owners, designers or users.  Operations  Security  Protection against the intended corruption of procedures or  workflows which will have results that were unintended by its  owners, designers or users.  Information  Security  Protection against the threat of theft, deletion or alteration of  stored or transmitted data within a cyber system.  Definition of Cybersecurity – Gaps and overlaps in standardisation  v1.0  |  December 2015  12  Physical Security  Protection against physical threats that can influence or affect  the well-being of a cyber system. Examples could be physical  access to servers, insertion of malicious hardware into a  network, or coercion of users or their families.  Public/National  Security  Protection against a threat whose origin is from within  cyberspace, but may threaten either physical or cyber assets in  a way which will have a political, military or strategic gain for  the attacker. Examples could be ‘Stuxnet’ or wide-scale DOS  attacks on utilities, communications financial system or other  critical public or industrial infrastructures.  This document specifically restricts its scope to Cybersecurity issues which are not specifically related to  aspects of Public/National or Physical Security.

Terminology of Cybersecurity in documentation  Composition of the Term  A deconstruction of the components that make up the definition of the ‘Cybersecurity’ domain is  illustrated below.  This diagram looks at the various aspects of the definition which are referred to and  implied when the definition is used by stakeholders.  This wide range of components adds to the wide variations in meaning of the term and has a potential to  obscure the true scope of a particular Cybersecurity action or intention.  Figure 2: Components constituting the definition of Cybersecurity  The following is a detailed description of the origin of the definition described in figure 2.  Criteria Explanation  Type of Document Obligatory: A document that has a definition that is founded in law, regulations or  mandatory standards.  Voluntary: A document that has a definition that is founded in agreed best- practice or reputable recommendations  CIA Based on CIA: The definition of ‘Cybersecurity’ uses and addresses the terms  ‘Confidentiality’, ‘Integrity’ and ‘Availability’  Without CIA: The definition of ‘Cybersecurity’ does not refer to, or include the  issues of ‘Confidentiality’, ‘Integrity’ and ‘Availability’.  Spelling The form of spelling that is being used. This provides consistency across a  definition and its use.  Organization The nature of the publishing organization may influence the factors or domains  that are addressed in the definition. This may influence the stakeholder sectore  applicability of the definition and therefore its usefulness.  Meaning of ‘Cyber’ The definition refers to the origin of a threat that is introduced via Cyberspace  rather than a physical attack.  Definition of Cybersecurity – Gaps and overlaps in standardisation  v1.0  |  December 2015  14  The definition looks only at targets that reduce the trustworthiness of a system or  process rather than a device that is controlled via a system originating in the  Cyberspace.  Types of  threatened assets  Related to the above, the class of the threatened system that is covered in the  definition of Cybersecurity’.  Motivation of  Threat Source  The definition may address the motivation of the threat, whether by intent, for  example criminal’, or unintentional, as a result of a by-product of another action.  Origin of Threat  Source  The definition may differentiate the origin of the threat. And may only consider  protection against threats arising from the ‘Cyber Space’, aka Internet and are  solely network based. Alternatively the definition may address the protection of  Information Systems from local threats such as ‘insider-threats’. Again,  the  definition may also address protection against physical attacks on the facility  hosting Information Systems.  Terminology as defined by dictionaries  3.2.1 Oxford  The Oxford Dictionaries – Online6 defines ‘cybersecurity’ as: The state of being protected against the  criminal or unauthorized use of electronic data, or the measures taken to achieve this.  3.2.2 Merriam Webster  The Merriam – Webster7 defines ‘cybersecurity’ as: Measures taken to protect a computer or computer  system (as on the Internet) against unauthorized access or attack  Terminology used by organisations  The organisations mentioned below use the term ‘Cybersecurity’ in various contexts.

For the purposes of this  consideration we look at standardisation aspects for the provision of security features (primitives,  protocols, services), for the reporting of security threat information, and for the organisational  management to give security assurance.  4.2.1 Security feature provision  Most technical standards bodies have prepared standards for the provision of sector/technology specific  security features. As an example the 3G PLMN has a set of standards covering authentication of terminals,  provision of air interface confidentiality (on the risk analysis result that the open air-interface is the  interface that is the most at risk), provision of signalling and data integrity validation services, of key  management for the cryptographic algorithms and the definition of the algorithms themselves including  addressing the export control of them.  4.2.2 Security assurance  The security assurance field is dominated, in standards, by the Common Criteria initiative (ISO 15408) and  by ongoing work in the 3GPP community. However in addition to this formal work a number of initiatives  are led by industry with product quality testing by Apple for example covering product security, by Google  for Android, and by Microsoft for the Windows platform.  It should be noted that it is not obligatory to adhere to any security assurance criteria and thus many  products have unverified security capability.  4.2.3 Security threat sharing  Sharing of threat information, current attack patterns, software vulnerabilities and so forth has been  standardised in process through the establishment of a network of CSIRTs (Computer Security Incident  Response Teams) and been augmented by the establishment and development of a number of initiatives  such as STIX/TAXII, CyBox, MISPs (Malware information Sharing Platform). Many of these initiatives are  standardised with STIX/TAXII/CybOX recently moved to the OASIS standards track (and this will be closely  followed by, amongst others, ETSI CYBER).  4.2.4 Organisational management for secure operations  The outstanding example in this domain is the ISO 27000 series of guides and recommendations. Within  this series ISO/IEC 27001 is a certification standard that is designed to help an organization to define a  framework for managing Information security more effectively which then points to ISO/IEC 17799 which  lists controls and interpretation for the same. For more specific IT functions the COBIT guides add  additional controls for implementing IT Governance within an organization, and ITIL extends these slightly  in the domain of IT Service Management covered by ISO standards ISO 20000-1 (guidance) and ISO 20000- 2 (certifiable standard).  Many individual nations have taken and either endorsed the ISO specifications as above or extended them  (noting that the ISO specifications themselves have been derived from a large number of national and  international security frameworks).  Definition of Cybersecurity – Gaps and overlaps in standardisation  v1.0  |  December 2015  24  5. Overlaps in standardisation efforts  Standardisation activities take place in international, national, and industry-based forums. Within Europe  the three European Standards Organizations, CEN, CENELEC, and ETSI cooperate to try and minimize the  amount of duplication of standards. Many groups have liaisons and co-operation agreements within the  various groups. However, there are many hundreds of groups that work on security or have security  related work streams, and working together between these groups has proved to be difficult.  There are many examples of duplication of work between standards organizations: For example on the  Internet of things we have work undertaken by ITU Study Group 209, oneM2M10 and also specific work  items in many other groups such as those looking at intelligent transport, Smart energy, Smart cities, and  many other related activities.  Similar overlaps, including those that are security related occur in topics such as Mobile radio between  3GPP, some of the ITU work, and also work within IETF on protocols.  Over the years many papers and efforts have been produced highlighting works within standards  organizations in order to highlight the overlaps. For example ITU has a Standards Roadmap11 detailing  different standards works, and some of the different and overlapping activities within organizations. The  Roadmap was launched by ITU Study Group 17, and became a joint effort in January 2007, when the  European Network and Information Security Agency (ENISA) and the Network and Information Security  Steering Group (NISSG) joined the initiative, but it suffers from the immense effort needed to keep it  current. A recent contribution to TC CYBER12 has also highlighted standards in the Global Cybersecurity  Ecosystem, and work going on worldwide in many areas.  Although this overlap is inevitable, organizations must ensure that they have sufficient contact between  themselves to minimize the impact, as the number of experts in the security area capable of working on  the subjects is necessarily limited.  When standards are being formulated, they should draw upon existing standards without change, or if any  changes are required, they should be fed back into those existing standards. Theree is a serious impact if  one standard draws directly from another standards, then changes in one standard are not reflected in  others.  The best way to ensure lack of overlaps in Cybersecurity standardisation would be for the SDOs to:   Ensure the availability of a Standards Catalogue, drawing upon the ITU, ENISA and NISSG initiative  above.   Introduce a method of referring to Standards so that impacts of changes can easily be tracked in  dependencies.  9 ITU-T SG20: IoT and its applications including smart cities and communities (SC&C) - http://www.itu.int/en/ITU- T/studygroups/2013-2016/20/Pages/default.aspx  10 OneM2m Standards for M2M and the Internet of Things http://www.onem2m.org/  11 ITU Standards Roadmap - http://www.itu.int/en/ITU-T/studygroups/2013-2016/17/ict/Pages/default.aspx  12 Global Cybersecurity Ecosystem – ETSI TR 103 306 -  https://portal.etsi.org/webapp/WorkProgram/Report_WorkItem.asp?wki_id=45906  Definition of Cybersecurity – Gaps and overlaps in standardisation  v1.0  |  December 2015  25  6. Gaps in standardisation activities  Overall situation  In some areas of standardisation, overlaps exists (like e.g. competing organizations as well as competing  technical standardization approaches) and will probably persist due to the political interests of commercial  as well as non-commercial organizations. Keeping in mind that monocultures usually lead to lower  progress while competition usually fosters evolution, the fact of overlap itself might not be that much of  an issue but mapping this to a limited amount of available resources (to e.g. participate in the process of  standardization), a very dynamic market with limited ability as well as limited motivation to quickly adopt  standards without “warranty” on sustainability could make the issue significant.  Some existing and well-accepted international standards (e.g. ISO/IEC 27035) are not reflected in European  norms, so based on careful evaluation and counseling with relevant stakeholders an easy solution could be  to adopt and reflect them into European norms where feasible. One should not focuson operational  aspects only but drive the overall cybersecurity standardization approach on strategic level.  Looking at it from such a perspective, the first gap in standardization to approach would be the lack of a  commonly accepted and formally standardized definition of the cyber domain. We also lack field-proven  standards on how to timely and practically evaluate the quality and effectiveness of modern technologies  that aim to provide protection against attacks.  Looking at the dynamically changing landscape of tools and technologies, the lack of applicable standards  leads to the situation where technology vendors keep proprietary solutions, while consumers are left  without transparency on their systems. Classic approaches to verification of technical requirements (e.g.  Common Criteria Protection Profiles) are complex and hard to keep-up with in dynamic markets,  technologies and changing threat landscape.  There are several globally acting large corporations based or originating in Europe, but the majority of the  economic ecosystem is made of mid-sized and small companies. From the point of view of the type of  business Europe has a globally strong position in Aerospace, Automotive, Chemicals, Defence, Engineering,  High Tech, Pharmaceutics and related goods and services. Some of these are ran under national and  international regulations and observe standards applicable to their fields. However, typical industry  regulations do not cover Cybersecurity directly, but through rules on technical and ethical compliance and  code of conduct of business.  Privacy is one of the core European basic rights. It is evident that especially this aspect seems to have been  left-out in the technical standards. Some industry practice standards (e.g. PCI DSS) as well as specific  requirements exist, but this is not sufficient to enable neutral evaluation of technologies nor services to  the national or European privacy regulations.  It is observed that although the market demand is shifting from pure technology towards so-called  Managed Security Services, there are yet no sustainable and accepted industry or conceptual standards  available on this topic. Some national security authorities (like French ANSSI, German BSI and British CESG)  started to work and pilot local schemes, partly overlapping but also following sometimes different  approaches.  Definition of Cybersecurity – Gaps and overlaps in standardisation  v1.0  |  December 2015  26  Mitigating the gaps  In many cases gaps in standardization are being addressed, but probably not at a sufficient level of  commonality in order to ensure that new products and services benefit from an appropriate attention to  security issues when they are being developed.  Areas in which there are many standards for example include:   Identity and associated mechanisms such as frameworks and architectures (e.g. ISO/IEC 24760),  identification and authorization protocols, (e.g. OpenID, OAuth, LID), Smart cards. However for  areas like privacy-friendly authentication the more technical standards still don’t exist.   Confidentiality, with multiple algorithms and key distribution techniques,   Integrity protection, some of which had to be modified when found to be insecure.   Privacy and related mechanisms, which exist in many places, such as those from the GSMA and  many other bodies: ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 27, W3C, OECD and The Information Commissioner’s Office in  The United Kingdom.  It is probably true and that there will never be universal systems for the design of security into systems,  products and services, and it can be argued that a diverse ecosystem of security techniques actually adds  to the security protecting against surprising vulnerabilities of specific techniques. Nevertheless when new  systems are being designed then it is vitally important that minimal changes, where possible, are made to  existing protocols.  There is also overlap between standardisation activities such as the convergence between safety and  security in critical infrastructure, the aeronautics industry and transport.  There are three strands to standards development, which we should consider:   The first strand is setting the overall requirements for security, privacy, and other related security  requirements. There are many examples of these from ISO/IEC JTC 1, NIST, and other similar  frameworks. What is lacking is a coherent method for bringing together these various frameworks,  so when a System, Service or Product has been developed, then the appropriate framework can be  used. The number of these frameworks should be minimised or, at least, the relationships  between them need to be better understood. There are also of course legal requirements, such as  those for Data protection, law enforcement, and Business such as trading information, which may  be sensitive. These requirements need also to be put into the framework.   The second strand is concerned with looking at the overall business and identifying the security  risks and threats. Too often security products and services are developed without understanding  these important issues, and without considering the flexibility (such as replacing algorithms) and  life cycle requirements from start to withdrawal from service.   The third strand is that of security technical implementation, this is partly well covered by the  various tools and techniques that exist. However there are many of these, and it would be useful  to consider how these could be reduced to enable reuse when they are required. In this way they  can more easily be built into Products and services and present a consistent Interface for the  customer and operator. Also missing are standards and guidelines to integrate the tools and  techniques towards systems, that can provide secure infrastructure services, e.g. as a basis for an  infrastructure initiative to provide cryptographically protected end-to-end- encrypted  communication to normal (non-expert) users. Also there is a lack of system standards for secure  and trustworthy (device) platforms, that can function as terminals for end-to-end protection  Definition of Cybersecurity – Gaps and overlaps in standardisation  v1.0  |  December 2015  27  usable by non-experts. Both are of importance if these services are to be made available in an  affordable manner to ordinary citizens and small businesses, e.g. via universal service provision.  It is probably true to say that there are many different standards on several technologies available; what  needs to be addressed is the reduction of the proliferation of very similar but incompatible tools and  techniques and the provision of essential services to non-expert users.  We would recommend that efforts are made to bring together the various requirements and initiatives in  strand one.  More work is required to identify risks and threats in strand two. We should work on a rationalization of  techniques that we are using in strand three towards a smoother integration of protection into existing  and emerging services and infrastructures.  One of the conclusions of the analysis of the existing approaches on standardization is that the landscape  is very scattered, from e.g. process-related standards down to e.g. single technology standards without  overall integration.  Definition of Cybersecurity – Gaps and overlaps in standardisation  v1.0  |  December 2015  28  7. Recommendations  Is there a need for a definition?  There does not need to be a definition for Cybersecurity in the conventional sense that we tend to apply to  definitions for simple things like authentication of an identity (a security mechanism allowing the  verification of the provided identity). The problem is that Cybersecurity is an enveloping term and it is not  possible to make a definition to cover the extent of the things Cybersecurity covers.  Therefore, a contextual definition, based on one that is relevant, fits, and is already used a particular SDO  or organisation should be considered. Concrete examples of such usage have been provided in Section 3.3.  For stakeholders and policymakers  Stakeholders should have an easy to understand guide so that they may refer, unambiguously to the scope  of Cybersecurity that they intend. Because of the breadth of the topic, as described, SDOs and other  organizations all have differing definitions.  Stakeholders and policymakers should consider the definitions as explained and choose the most  appropriate SDO and definition when considering their requirements. By referencing a specific definition  (and any exceptions to that definition in the requirements), clarity can be maintained.  Based on the previous summary table in chapter 3.4, it is possible to use the following graphic  representations as a guide to selection of the correct definition and associated spelling. In the following  figures, fields marked in red represent the components of definitions used in specific context. The table  (Figure 8) depicts comparison between the contexts.

Cybersecurity shall  therefore encompass the CIA paradigm for relationships and objects within cyberspace and extend that  same CIA paradigm to address protection of privacy for legal entities (people and corporations), and to  address resilience (recovery from attack).  For SDOs  SDOs are encouraged to embrace the concept of cybersecurity as the provision of security capabilities to  apply to cyberspace. Existing use of the terms under the CIA paradigm when applied to single interfaces  and single classes of object shall explicitly not use the term Cybersecurity.

Cybersecurity risk management issues are becoming increasingly familiar topics in  executive management ofces and boardrooms. That is as true for businesses as it is for federal and other  government organizations.  No doubt that is because every year brings more troubling reports of organizations experiencing fnancial and  reputational damage from both novel and well-known threats and vulnerabilities. But what does not get nearly  as much attention are the impressive advances that so many organizations have been making in thoughtfully  and successfully securing their information and processes and the systems upon which those organizations,  their leaders, and their customers depend.  That’s where the cybersecurity work of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) comes  into play. For nearly 50 years, we have been helping organizations to succeed in building the strategies and  in employing the tools needed to better recognize, anticipate, and manage cybersecurity risks. Our diverse  cybersecurity activities are an essential ingredient in carrying out the NIST Information Technology Laboratory’s  mission: to cultivate trust in information and technology. We do that by conducting foundational and applied  cybersecurity research to produce and advance cybersecurity standards, best practices, measurements, and  reference resources. While NIST has an explicit statutory mission to focus on federal government agencies,  our work can and is being heavily leveraged by large and small businesses, state and local agencies, and other  organizations. Ultimately, this benefts taxpayers, investors, consumers, our digital economy, and our national  security.  However, we don’t work alone. To the contrary, all cybersecurity eforts at NIST are based on input from, and  often in cooperation with, the private sector and other government agencies.  We also don’t work in the dark. NIST prides itself on being transparent, open, and collaborative. When we  actively engage the private and public sectors, we rely on and use experts from around the country – and around  the globe – to complement the talents of our own staf. Exposing our thinking to others helps to improve the  quality, relevance, and likely use of the end product.  This report features some of our most signifcant accomplishments during Fiscal Year (FY) 2017 in risk  management, cryptography, identity and access management, vulnerability management, education and  workforce development, and internet and communications infrastructure, as well as our eforts to transition our  work into common practice. Below are just a few highlights of the work carried out in 2017.  • In recent years, there has been a substantial amount of research on quantum computers – machines  that exploit quantum mechanical phenomena to solve problems that are difcult or intractable for  conventional computers. If large-scale quantum computers are ever built, they will be able to break the  existing infrastructure of public-key cryptography. Employing NIST’s proven approach of worldwide  open competitions, in 2016 we solicited submissions for quantum-resistant public-key cryptographic  algorithms for standards.  These algorithms must be secure against both quantum and classical  computers and should interoperate with existing communications protocols and networks. We now are  engaging the cryptographic community in the difcult work of determining how the 69 submissions we  received in 2017 meet the competition’s exacting requirements.  • In instances where many devices are interconnected and working in concert to accomplish some task,  security and privacy can be very important but hard to achieve due to limited capabilities available  to handle modern cryptographic algorithms. This includes automotive systems, sensor networks,  1  healthcare, distributed control systems, the smart grid, and cyber-physical systems and the Internet of  Things (IoT). Recognizing this special challenge and in order to gain greater awareness and involvement  with the cryptographic community, NIST shared its fndings in this area (known as lightweight  cryptography) and presented our plans to address standardization issues for community feedback.  • NIST improved two widely used guidelines that provide senior leaders with the information they need  to make risk-based decisions afecting critical mission and business functions. We proposed revisions  to Security and Privacy Controls for Information Systems and Organizations (Special Publication (SP)  800-53) and Risk Management Framework for Information Systems and Organizations (SP 800-37). The  latter provides a closer link between risk management processes and activities at various organizational  levels. It demonstrates how the Cybersecurity Framework can be implemented using established Risk  Management Framework processes. Both publications will be fnalized in 2018.  • Refecting a growing recognition of the link between cybersecurity and privacy risk management, we  collaborated with internal and external partners to integrate privacy requirements and considerations  into SP 800-53 and SP 800-37 risk management guidelines as well as our latest version of NIST’s Digital  Identity Guidelines (SP 800-63-3), which covers digital identity from the initial risk assessment to the  deployment of federated identity solutions. These guidelines build the foundation needed to make  privacy and security equal, quality attributes in trustworthy systems. We focused on encouraging the  adoption of trusted identities through digital identity standards for federal agencies and internationally.  • The supply chain that provides the information and operational technology (IT/OT) upon which we all  depend has evolved into a complex, globally distributed, dynamic ecosystem enabling the development  of highly refned, sophisticated, cost-efective, and reusable solutions. In FY 2017, we published a  proposed process model providing a method to identify and prioritize IT/OT systems and components.  The approach aims to increase an organization’s ability to make cost-efective risk decisions by  determining the systems and components that have the greatest impact on the organization and that  would potentially cause the most harm if compromised.  • As NIST continues to collaborate with stakeholders to raise awareness and encourage the use of the  voluntary Cybersecurity Framework, we solicited public comments on a draft update of the frst (2014)  version and hosted a widely attended workshop that charted progress and shared issues to which  NIST now has given additional attention. In May 2017, the President’s Executive Order 13800 directed  federal agency heads to use the Cybersecurity Framework to manage cybersecurity risk. In response,  NIST released draft guidance on how the Risk Management Framework and Cybersecurity Framework  can work together to help agencies develop, implement, and continuously improve their information  security programs. After incorporating public comments, NIST released the Baldrige Cybersecurity  Excellence Builder, a self-assessment tool based in part on the Cybersecurity Framework, to help  organizations better understand the efectiveness of their cybersecurity risk management eforts.  • In FY 2017, NIST’s National Cybersecurity Center of Excellence (NCCoE) began taking full advantage  of its expanded, more capable facilities to accelerate the adoption of standards-based, security  technologies. Healthcare and fnancial services were two areas that had notable progress, including  the development of new draft practice guides on securing wireless infusion pumps and on managing  access rights for the fnancial sector. NCCoE also leveraged industry partners’ expertise to produce a  guide on how organizations can develop strategies to recover operating systems, user fles, applications,  and other IT assets from data corruption events such as ransomware. The guide also ofers insights on  auditing, reporting, and investigations following a company’s discovery of such destructive security  incidents. Other guides addressed the authentication of mobile device users with personal identity  verifcation credentials and how organizations can use attribute-based access controls to better  manage employee access to data and networks.  WELCOME LETTER | FY 2017  2  NIST/ITL CYBERSECURITY PROGRAM ANNUAL REPORT 2017  • The NIST-led National Initiative for Cybersecurity Education (NICE) made noteworthy strides in FY  2017 to foster, energize, and promote a robust network and an integrated ecosystem of cybersecurity  education, training, and workforce development. We published the NICE Cybersecurity Workforce  Framework, establishing a taxonomy and common lexicon to describe all cybersecurity work and  workers, irrespective of where or for whom the work is performed. NICE launched “CyberSeek,”an  online tool that provides a visualization of the demand for and the supply of cybersecurity workers  across the country as well as career pathways in cybersecurity. Via NICE, NIST served as the Commerce  Department’s lead, working with the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to analyze U.S.  cybersecurity workforce issues and ofer recommendations in response to the President’s May 2017  Executive Order.  Looking ahead - with full knowledge that new challenges are constantly emerging - we are moving towards  collaborating with industry, government agencies, and others who use NIST’s cybersecurity research, standards,  and guides. For example, in FY 2018 NIST is assigning higher priority to the cybersecurity and privacy aspects  of the Internet of Things (IoT). Researchers in our Cybersecurity for IoT program are working with industry  to produce guidance and best practices, as well as to perform research and coordinate standards within and  across sectors in the digital economy. We are reviewing international standards-based approaches to the IoT  challenges and ramping up our IoT-related identity work. NIST is also launching a project to provide organizations  with practical guidance to reduce the vulnerability of IoT devices to botnets and other automated distributed  threats, while also limiting the utility of compromised devices to malicious actors. Such eforts are paving the  way toward more secure IoT devices in the future.  In addition to the work in IoT, NIST has embarked on a project to automate much of the testing required  under the cryptographic validation programs. We expect that automated cryptographic algorithm testing will  be complete in 2018, and we will then begin developing methods to automate the testing of cryptographic  modules. These eforts in automation are intended to provide a higher trust in the assurance claims made by the  product developers, but do so in an efcient, and cost-efective manner that allows the vendors’ conformance  eforts to keep pace with the changing IT landscape.  By investing in a more robust testing infrastructure, NIST  hopes that product vendors will take advantage of this service by validating their products more often, which  will produce more secure products.  In reporting on our accomplishments, NIST welcomes all suggestions about how we can improve our work.  We do this so that we can provide the nation with the kind of cybersecurity information and tools needed to  cultivate trust in information and technology while advancing and protecting our economy and our nation.  All projects in this report include contact information for the key NIST contacts. Let us hear from you.  Donna F. Dodson,  NIST Chief Cybersecurity Advisor  3  BACKGROUND INFORMATION OF ANNUAL REPORT  This Annual Report provides the opportunity to describe the many cybersecurity program highlights and  accomplishments from throughout the NIST Information Technology Laboratory (ITL).

INTRODUCTION | FY 2017  4  NIST/ITL CYBERSECURITY PROGRAM ANNUAL REPORT 2017  THE INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY LABORATORY  IMPLEMENTS THE FEDERAL INFORMATION  SECURITY MANAGEMENT ACT  This section contains a list of the major activities that were  accomplished during FY 2017 by the ITL Cybersecurity Program.  Detailed explanations of these activities are provided in the next  section.  5  ITL IMPLEMENTS THE FISMA ACTIvITIES |  FY 2017  INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY  LABORATORY (ITL)  CYBERSECURITY PROGRAM  IMPLEMENTS FEDERAL  INFORMATION SECURITY  MANAGEMENT ACT  The E-Government Act, Public Law 107-347,  passed by the 107th Congress and signed into law  by the President in December 2002, recognized the  importance of information security to the economic  and national security interests of the United States.  Title III of the E-Government Act, titled the Federal  Information Security Management Act (FISMA) of  2002, included the duties and responsibilities for  the National Institute of Standards and Technology,  Information Technology Laboratory (ITL). There  are multiple divisions within ITL that are involved  with cybersecurity programs and projects. The  work is being conducted collaboratively between  the divisions. In December 2014, the 113th Congress  updated FISMA as the Federal Information Security  Modernization Act (Public Law 113-283). NIST ITL  responsibilities were unchanged in the update. In FY  2017, the ITL Cybersecurity Program addressed its  assignment through the following major activities:  • Forty-one NIST Special Publications (SP) (20  approved as fnal and 21 drafts) were issued,  providing management, operational, and  technical security guidelines in a variety of  topic areas, including:  The 2016 Annual Report, the National  Initiative for Cybersecurity Education (NICE)  Cybersecurity Workforce Framework,  attribute-based access control and access  control standards and policies, application  container security, Secure Hash Algorithm-3  (SHA-3) derived functions, cybersecurity  event recovery, data integrity, recovering  from ransomware and other destructive  events, securing Apple OS X 10.10 systems,  protecting controlled unclassifed information  in nonfederal information systems and  organizations, systems security engineering,  cyber threat information sharing, bluetooth  security, the National Checklist Program,  digital identity guidelines, block cipher modes  of operation, the Cipher-Based Message  Authentication Code (CMAC) - a Mode for  Authentication, an introduction to information  security, a report of the workshop on software  measures and metrics to reduce security  vulnerabilities, platform frmware resiliency,  fog computing, de-identifying government  datasets, Long Term Evolution (LTE) security,  trustworthy email, security recommendations  for hypervisor deployment, the Triple Data  Encryption Algorithm (TDEA) Block Cipher,  key-derivation methods in key-establishment  schemes, pair-wise key-establishment  schemes using discrete logarithm  cryptography, security and privacy controls, a  risk management framework for information  systems and organizations, personal identity  verifcation (PIV) credentials, access rights  management for the fnancial services sector,  securing wireless infusion pumps in healthcare  delivery organizations, situational awareness  for electric utilities, and domain name systems- based electronic mail security.  • Fifteen NIST Interagency/Internal Reports  (NISTIR) (10 approved as fnal and 5 drafts)  were issued on a variety of topics, including:  A criticality analysis process model,  security assurance challenges for container  deployment, the cybersecurity framework for  federal agencies, a cybersecurity framework  manufacturing profle, dramatically reducing  software vulnerabilities, code complexity  on software analysis, identifying uniformity  with entropy and divergence, enhancing  resilience of the Internet and communications  ecosystem, mobile application vetting services  for public safety, lightweight cryptography,  privacy engineering and risk management  in federal systems, automation support for  security control assessments, and small  business information security.  • Formally Launched a Post-Quantum  Cryptography (PQC) Standardization  Process:  The research community has actively  responded to the NIST Call for Proposals to 6  NIST/ITL CYBERSECURITY PROGRAM ANNUAL REPORT 2017  solicit, evaluate, and standardize quantum- resistant public key cryptography (also known  as post-quantum cryptography (PQC))  algorithms. Upon the submission deadline,  NIST received 82 submissions from 26  countries and 6 continents, among which 69  submissions are considered as complete and  proper. The NIST Post-Quantum Cryptography  team has worked closely with the submitters  and the research community to evaluate and  analyze the frst-round candidates.  • Lightweight Cryptography Standards for the  Internet of Things (IoT):  The Internet of Things (IoT) tethers  heterogeneous “things” together. Some of the  “things” are resource constrained. Lightweight  cryptography provides critical tools for IoT  security. To better understand the need for  dedicated lightweight cryptography, the  NIST team released a white paper in 2017 to  specify two major portfolios for lightweight  cryptography primitives. NIST will announce a  call for proposals on lightweight cryptography  primitives in 2018.  • A NIST / Industry joint working group  continued the development of automated  cryptographic implementation testing:  After working with industry on the protocol  necessary to exchange cryptographic  test data in an automated fashion, the  development of the cryptographic algorithm  testing service to be hosted at NIST is fully  under way, with the full implementation  expected in FY 2018. (See: http://csrc.nist.gov/  projects/acvt).  • Published an Initial Public Draft of Special  Publication (SP) 800-53, Revision 5:  NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5, Security and  Privacy Controls for Information Systems  and Organizations, is a comprehensive set of  safeguarding measures that are applicable to  all types of computing platforms, including  traditional IT systems, cloud and mobile  systems, industrial/process control systems,  and Internet of Things (IoT) devices. The  safeguarding measures in the update to  7 this publication include a full integration of  security and privacy controls to protect the  operations and assets of organizations and the  personal privacy of individuals. Additionally,  this update promotes the integration with  diferent risk management and cybersecurity  approaches and lexicons, including the  Cybersecurity Framework.  The Initial Public  Comment period resulted in over 3000  comments from over 115 diferent stakeholders  representing the public and private sectors,  and academia.  • Published a Discussion Draft of SP 800-37,  Revision 2:  This update to NIST SP 800-37 Revision 2,  Risk Management Framework for Information  Systems and Organizations: A System Life  Cycle Approach for Security and Privacy,  responds to the call by the Defense Science  Board, the President’s Executive Order on  Strengthening the Cybersecurity of Federal  Networks and Critical Infrastructure, and  the Ofce of Management and Budget  Memorandum M-17-25, to develop the next- generation Risk Management Framework  (RMF) for systems and organizations.  This  update provides linkage and communication  between the risk management processes and  activities at the executive and operational  levels of the organization; demonstrates  how the Cybersecurity Framework can be  implemented using the established NIST risk  management processes (i.e., developing a  Federal use case); and integrates privacy  concepts into the RMF.  This discussion draft  was issued to inform a public workshop for  RMF stakeholders and featured discussions on  the risk management methodologies used in  various sectors and potential opportunities to  improve the RMF.  • The Cyber Supply Chain Risk Management  (C-SCRM) program continued to work  with stakeholders to develop and improve  FISMA-related guidance on C-SCRM:  C-SCRM controls were signifcantly modifed  in a draft of NIST SP 800-53, Security and  Privacy Controls for Information Systems  and Organizations, to better align with  other guidance. A working group co-chaired  by NIST and the Department of Defense  http://csrc.nist.gov/projects/acvt http://csrc.nist.gov/projects/acvt  ITL IMPLEMENTS THE FISMA ACTIvITIES |  FY 2017     completed a revision of Committee On incorporated into a proof-of-concept software  National Security Systems Directives (CNSSD) tool that is freely available.  Number 505, Supply Chain Risk Management,  which assigns responsibilities and establishes  minimum criteria for the development and  deployment of supply chain risk management  capabilities for national security systems.  Also, NIST collaborated with over 3,000  stakeholders through the Software and  Supply Chain Assurance (SSCA) Forum  and email list service. The efort, initiated in  2003, is co-led by NIST, the Department of  Homeland Security (DHS), the Department  of Defense (DOD) and the U.S. General  Services Administration (GSA) and provides  a venue for government, industry, and  academic participants from around the world  to discuss cyber supply chain risks, efective  practices and mitigation strategies, tools and  technologies, and any gaps related to the  people, processes, or technologies involved.  • The goal of the ITL’s Usable Security and  Privacy project team is to provide guidance  for policymakers, system engineers and  security professionals so that they can make  better decisions that enhance the usability  of cybersecurity in their organizations:  The Usable Security and Privacy team  contributed usability chapters to SP 800-63,  Digital Identity Guidelines, marking the frst  time there were dedicated usability chapters  in this fagship NIST security publication. In  addition, the usability team also completed  a long-term operational phishing evaluation,  demonstrating the importance of individual  user context in explaining phishing email click  decisions.  • Method developed for efcient automated  testing of systems used in Artifcial  Intelligence (AI) applications:  NIST developed a method of automatically  testing and verifying rule-based systems  to a high degree of assurance. The method  uses a mathematical construct known as  a covering array to exhaustively test all  components of rules used in many classes of  artifcial intelligence applications, for a large  subset of such applications. The method was  • Final Draft of a NIST Special Publication  providing guidance on how to securely  confgure Apple OS X systems:  NIST developed this publication to assist  IT professionals in securing Apple OS X  10.10 desktop and laptop systems within  various environments. It provides detailed  information about the security features of OS  X 10.10 and security confguration guidelines.  The publication recommends and explains  tested, secure settings with the objective  of simplifying the administrative burden of  improving the security of OS X 10.10 systems  in three types of environments: Standalone,  Managed, and Specialized Security-Limited  Functionality.  • Began the integration of privacy into the  Risk Management Framework documents:  A July 2016 update to Ofce of Management  and Budget (OMB) Circular A-130 requires  federal agencies to apply the Risk  Management Framework to privacy programs  - managing privacy risk beyond compliance  with privacy laws, regulations and policies.  In alignment with this policy, the Privacy  Engineering Program in ITL has been working  to integrate privacy into the Risk Management  Framework documents, providing one unifed  security and privacy approach – as seen in  the initial draft of SP 800-53rev5 and the  discussion draft of SP 800-37rev2.  • Introduced concepts for privacy engineering  and risk management as the foundation  for the integration of privacy into the Risk  Management Framework documents:  The Privacy Engineering Program in ACD  published NISTIR 8062, An Introduction to  Privacy Engineering and Risk Management in  Federal Systems. This publication establishes  the basis for a common vocabulary  to facilitate better understanding and  communication of privacy risk within federal  systems, and the efective implementation  of privacy principles. It introduces two key  components to support the application of 8  privacy engineering and risk management:  NIST/ITL CYBERSECURITY PROGRAM ANNUAL REPORT 2017  privacy engineering objectives and a privacy  risk model. These concepts lay the foundation  for the integration of privacy into the Risk  Management Framework (as seen in the latest  revisions of SP 800-53 and SP 800-37).  • Comprehensive Security Guidance for  Virtualized Infrastructures and Contributions  to Standards Development:  A set of security recommendations for server  virtualization were updated in the publication  of SP 800-125A, Security Recommendations  for Hypervisor Deployment on Servers, by  including emerging use cases. NIST security  guidance for this technology now covers  hardware, hypervisor (the core server  virtualization software), virtual network  and management modules.  The active  participation of NIST in the editorial team  for the International Organization For  Standardization/International Electrotechnical  Commission (ISO/IEC) 21878, Security  guidelines for design and implementation  of virtualized servers, has advanced the  standard from a working draft in October  2016 to a Draft International Standard  (DIS) in October 2017. In the area of OS  virtualization, the potential solutions for  security countermeasures outlined in SP  800-190, Application Container Security  Guide, were examined, and security  assurance requirements for each solution  were developed to guide actual security  confgurations. These security assurance  requirements were published in NISTIR 8176,  Security Assurance Requirements for Linux  Application Container Deployments, for the  open source Linux platform where application  containers are ubiquitously developed and  deployed.  • Established the NIST Cybersecurity Program  for the Internet of Things (IoT):  ITL created a program for IoT cybersecurity  that supports the development and  application of standards, guidelines, and  related tools to improve IoT cybersecurity.  Program establishment included creating an  9  inventory of NIST-wide eforts related to IoT  cybersecurity, coordinating among  NIST IoT  eforts, and  convening a team of subject- matter experts to begin drafting guidance on  managing IoT cybersecurity and privacy risks.  • The IoT Program convened cross-sector  stakeholders to inform IoT cybersecurity  eforts:  The IoT Cybersecurity Program coordinated  outreach to a range of public and private- sector stakeholders to inform them of NIST’s  IoT cybersecurity work and collect feedback  to inform future work. This included sessions  at the Cybersecurity Framework Workshop in  2017, the Industrial Internet Consortium (IIC)  quarterly meeting, and planning a colloquium  with industry, government, and academic  participants.  • The National Initiative for Cybersecurity  Excellence (NICE) program provided  numerous communication channels and  maintained a visible high-level presence in  supporting its mission to the cybersecurity  workforce and education felds:  The NICE program published three  eNewsletters; launched an updated and  refreshed the NICE Website to better meet  the needs of the NICE Community and  visitors; produced 3 new one-page reports  and updated the content of three others;  produced two ITL Science Day posters;  established a LinkedIn presence and hashtag  for Tweets from the @NISTCyber twitter  account; developed a NICE Multimedia page;  participated in seven conference exhibit  displays; and hosted ten webinar sessions.  • The NICE Program also developed and  published two NIST publications to support  the Cybersecurity Workforce:  During FY 2017, the NICE Program published  NIST Special Publication 800-181, National  Initiative for Cybersecurity Education (NICE)  Cybersecurity Workforce Framework, and  the Draft NIST Interagency Report (NISTIR)  8193, National Initiative for Cybersecurity  Education (NICE) Framework Work Role  Capability Indicators: Indicators for Performing  Work Roles. The national need for a common  lexicon to describe and organize the  cybersecurity workforce and the requisite  ITL IMPLEMENTS THE FISMA ACTIvITIES |  FY 2017  knowledge, skills, and abilities (KSAs) led  to the creation of the NICE Cybersecurity  Workforce Framework (NICE Framework).  The NICE Framework defnes the spectrum  of cybersecurity work as well as tasks and for  over 50 common Work Roles. While the Work  Roles have made the NICE Framework easier  to associate with specifc positions, they do  not provide organizations with guidance on  how to determine if a cybersecurity worker  can perform a Work Role. NISTIR 8193 is  intended to help organizations address this  challenge by identifying capability indicators  or recommended education, certifcation,  training, experiential learning, and continuous  learning that could signal an increased ability  to perform a given Work Role.  • The NICE program provided strategic  outreach and engagement with stakeholders  throughout FY 2017:  The NICE Program increased its outreach  eforts to include new academic, industry,  and government organizations, including  international stakeholders through various  meetings and collaborative eforts including  the NICE Working Group and NICE  Interagency Coordinating Council.  • Seven NIST National Cybersecurity Center  of Excellence (NCCoE) Special Publications  (SP) 1800 Series Practice Guides (one  revised draft and six new drafts) were  issued, providing management, operational,  and technical security guidelines in topic  areas including:  Attribute Based Access Control, Domain  Name Systems-Based Email Security,  Situational Awareness for the Electric  Utilities, Securing Wireless Infusion Pumps in  Healthcare Delivery Organizations, Managing  Access Rights in the Financial Services  Sector, Data Integrity: Recovering from  Ransomware and Other Destructive Events,  and Derived Personal Identity Verifcation  (PIV) Credentials.  • The ITL Software Assurance and Quality  Program researched and improved how to  assess a tool’s ability to detect and identify  code problems in the Software Assurance  Metrics And Tool Evaluation (SAMATE)  program:  The SAMATE program has three primary  components: the Software Assurance  Reference Dataset (SARD), the Static Analysis  Tool Exposition (SATE), and the Bugs  Framework (BF). Mobile applications and  test cases used in former Static Analysis Tool  Expositions were added to SARD.  In 2017, the  sixth instance of SATE began.  • ITL’s Computer Forensics Team researched  ways to improve the methods for securely  acquiring, storing and analyzing digital  evidence quickly and efciently:  ITL promoted the efcient and efective  use of computer technology to investigate  crimes. The project team developed tools for  testing computer forensic software, including  test criteria and test sets. ITL also maintains  the National Software Reference Library  (NSRL) – a vast archive of published software  applications that is an important resource for  both criminal investigators and historians.  The NSRL published four releases of the  Reference Data Set (RDS) that continues to  be the premier software resource. The NSRL  was expanded to include mobile apps and to  include the profles obtained from installing  and exercising applications.  • Ongoing involvement and outreach support  among various programs:  ITL provided assistance to agencies and  the private sector through many outreach  programs, including the National Initiative for  Cybersecurity Education (NICE), the Federal  Information Systems Security Educators’  Association (FISSEA), and the Federal  Computer Security Managers’ Forum.  • Continued support and involvement of the  Information Security and Privacy Advisory  Board (ISPAB):  NIST solicited recommendations from the  Information Security and Privacy Advisory  Board (ISPAB) on draft standards and  guidelines regarding information security and  privacy issues. 10  NIST/ITL CYBERSECURITY PROGRAM ANNUAL REPORT 2017  • In support of FISMA activities, ITL  conducted workshops, awareness briefngs,  webinars, and various outreach to ITL  customers:  The ITL Cybersecurity Program hosted or  provided at least 55 diferent cybersecurity  events throughout FY 2017.  These outreach  activities were open to the public or for  federal agencies. These events covered various  Cybersecurity topics – to see the complete list  of these events, please see Appendix B at the  back of this Annual Report for further details.

Various ITL staf participate in many cybersecurity  standards’ activities either in leadership positions  or as editors and contributors, including the  American National Standards Institute (ANSI); the  International Organization for Standardization (ISO);  the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC);  the Biometric Application Programming Interface  (BioAPI) Consortium; the Bluetooth Special Interest  Group (SIG); the Bluetooth Security Expert Group  (BT-SEG); the International Telecommunications  Union - Telecommunication Standardization Sector  (ITU-T); various groups within the Institute of Electrical  and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) and the Internet  Engineering Task Force (IETF); the North American  Security Products Organization (NASPO); the Trusted  Computing Group (TCG); and Accredited Standards  Committee X9, Inc. (ASC X9, Inc.) (e.g., X9F – Data  & Information Security Subcommittee). Many of ITL’s  publications have been the basis for both national and  international standards projects.  Focus on ISO and ANSI Standardization (ISO/  IEC JTC1 SC27 IT Security)  The following paragraphs discuss ITL staf activities  in conjunction with the InterNational Committee for  Information Technology Standards (INCITS) Technical  Committee Cybersecurity 1 (CS1), where ITL’s Mr. Sal  Francomacaro serves as the CS1 Vice Chair. CS1 is the  U.S. counterpart for the ISO/IEC SC27 committee for  IT Security.  Figure 1: SDOs involved in Cybersecurity  13  ITL CYBERSECURITY PROGRAM AND PROJECTS  |  FY 2017  IT Security Techniques Standards –  ISO/IEC SC27  The ITL staf actively participate with JTC1/SC27  and its working groups to develop standards for  the protection of information and communications  technology (ICT). This includes generic methods,  techniques and guidelines to address both security  and privacy aspects, such as:  • Management of information and ICT  security; in particular, information security  management systems, security processes, and  security controls and services;  • Cryptographic and other security  mechanisms, including but not limited to,  mechanisms for protecting the accountability,  availability, integrity and confdentiality of  information;  • Security management support  documentation, including terminology and  guidelines as well as procedures for the  registration of security components;  • Security aspects of identity management,  biometrics and privacy;  • Conformance assessment, accreditation  and auditing requirements in the area of  information security management systems;  and  • Security evaluation criteria and methodology.  The ITL staf also engages in active liaison and  collaboration with appropriate bodies to ensure  the proper development and application of SC 27  standards and technical reports in relevant areas.  CONTACT:  Mr. Salvatore Francomacaro  (301) 975-6414  salfra@nist.gov  NIST Cybersecurity Framework –  International Standardization  The NIST/ITL staf actively participate with  JTC1/SC27 and its working groups to support  the NIST Cybersecurity Framework International  Standardizations strategy.  The main focus for FY 2017 was the development  of a Technical Specifcation based on ISO/IEC 27101 –  Guidelines for developing cybersecurity frameworks.  This Technical Specifcation (TS) represents the work  done by a U.S. group on NIST Cybersecurity Framework  and should serve as a guideline for other organizations  considering creating a new cybersecurity framework.  The NIST staf was also active in the defnition of  another ISO Technical Specifcation: Cybersecurity  Overview and Concepts. This TS should target any  user concerned with cybersecurity, but is particularly  targeted toward decision makers. It should cover,  among other things, what cybersecurity IS and IS NOT,  how it applies to existing standards, and how it fts in  with the other ISO/IEC 27000 series of standards.  The NIST staf will increase participation and efort  on these activities during FY 2018.  CONTACT:  Mr. Matt Barrett  (301) 975-6259  matthew.barrett@nist.gov  ISO Standardization of Security  Requirements for Cryptographic  Modules  ITL is also the principal editor, co-editor, and  contributor to many ISO/IEC documents by the ISO/  IEC International Organization for Standardization.  ITL’s contributions to the development of these  international standards help to create a strong  foundation for the adoption of and migration from  currently used national standards. In particular, this  adoption promotes international harmonization for  the implementation and testing of cryptographic  algorithms and modules, while accommodating  individual country preferences in the choice of  approved security functions.  ITL has contributed to the activities of ISO/IEC  JTC 1 SC/27, which published ISO/IEC 19790, Security  Requirements for Cryptographic Modules, on March  1, 2006, and ISO/IEC 24759, Test Requirements  for Cryptographic Modules, on July 1, 2008.

These  eforts bring consistent testing of cryptographic  modules to the global community by providing  ISO-equivalent standards representing Federal  Information Processing Standard (FIPS) 140-2,  Security Requirements for Cryptographic Modules  and Derived Test Requirements [DTR] for FIPS 140-2,  Security Requirements for Cryptographic Modules. Mr.  Randall Easter (CSD) continues as the principal editor  for these standards.  ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 27 Working Group (WG) 3  completed and published revisions, followed with  updated corrections, of ISO/IEC 19790:2006 and  ISO/IEC 24759:2008. The second revision of ISO/  IEC 19790 was published on August 15, 2012. The  second revision of ISO/IEC 24759 was published on  January 31, 2014 and the third revision was published  March 2017. Both ISO/IEC standards are available  through the American National Standards Institute  (ANSI) (see: http://webstore.ansi.org/RecordDetail.  aspx?sku=ISO%2FIEC+19790%3A2012). The two  ISO/IEC revisions were developed with international  support and the collaboration of governments,  industry and academia.  The revision of ISO/IEC 19790:2012 addresses  new security areas, such as defned software module  boundaries, degraded modes of operation, trusted  channels, two-factor authentication, software security,  mitigation of fault induction and side-channel attacks,  operational self-tests for algorithms, and lifecycle  assurance from design to end-of-life.  Figure 2 is a chart of the ISO/IEC standards, as  explained above, in which CSD has played a part  during the development process.  In addition to the aforementioned standards,  International Standards ISO/IEC 17825, Testing  methods for the mitigation of non-invasive attack  classes against cryptographic modules, was published  on January 15, 2016 and ISO/IEC 18367, Cryptographic  algorithms and security mechanisms conformance  testing, was published on December 15, 2016. Mr.  Easter was the editor of both standards.  International Standard ISO/IEC 17825 specifes  the non-invasive attack mitigation test metrics  for determining conformance to the requirements  specifed in ISO/IEC 19790 for Security Levels 3 and  4. The test metrics are associated with the security  functions specifed in ISO/IEC 19790. Testing will  be conducted at the defned boundary of the  cryptographic module and using Input/Output (I/O)  available at the defned boundary.  Figure 2: Cryptographic Module Testing – ISO Standards 15  http://webstore.ansi.org/RecordDetail.aspx?sku=ISO%2FIEC+19790%3A2012 http://webstore.ansi.org/RecordDetail.aspx?sku=ISO%2FIEC+19790%3A2012  ITL CYBERSECURITY PROGRAM AND PROJECTS  |  FY 2017  International Standard ISO/IEC 18367 describes  conformance testing methods for cryptographic  algorithms and security mechanisms. Conformance  testing assures that an implementation of a  cryptographic algorithm or security mechanism is  correct whether implemented in hardware, software  or frmware. It also confrms that it runs correctly  in a specifc operating environment. Testing may  consist of known-answer or Monte Carlo testing,  or a combination of test methods. Testing may be  performed on the actual implementation or modeled  in a simulation environment.  The test methods used by testing laboratories to  test whether the cryptographic module conforms to  the requirements specifed in ISO/IEC 19790 and the  test metrics specifed in this International Standard  for each of the associated security functions specifed  in ISO/IEC 19790 are specifed in ISO/IEC 24759. The  test approach employed in this International Standard  is an efcient “push-button” approach: the tests are  technically sound, repeatable and have moderate  costs.

Easter  (240) 361-8777  randall.easter@nist.gov  Next Generation Access Control  Standards  ITL has continued the development of an advanced  Attribute Based Access Control (ABAC) framework  called the Policy Machine, which was designed to be  in alignment with an emerging ANSI/INCITS standard  under the title of “Next Generation Access Control”  (NGAC).  The NIST Policy Machine research and  development efort has resulted in three ongoing  national standards projects in CS1 that are in the early  stages of development. They include:  • Next Generation Access Control – Functional  Architecture (NGAC-FA). Project number  INCITS 499-2013, was published in FY 2013  and is currently under revision.  • Next Generation Access Control – Generic  Operations & Abstract Data Structures  (NGAC-GOADS). Serban Gavrila, ITL, is the  editor. The project is assigned project number  2195-D, and the document was published  during FY 2016.  • Next Generation Access Control –  Implementation Requirements, Protocols  and API Defnitions (NGAC-IRPADS). Project  number 2193-D has been assigned. This part  will be published in FY 2018.

GICS enables Personal Identity Verifcation (PIV),  PIV-Interoperable (PIV-I) and Common Access Card  (CAC) applications, and others, to be built from a  single platform. GICS defnes an open platform where  identity applications can be instantiated, deployed,  and used in an interoperable way between the  credential issuers and credential users that aligns with  the last revision of the NIST SP 800-73-4, Interfaces  for Personal Identity Verifcation, (PIV) specifcations.  During FY 2017, the ITL staf:  • Contributed to the publication of several  revisions of the ISO/IEC 7816 family of  standards (Identifcation cards - Integrated  circuit cards), which are all relevant to FIPS  201, Personal Identity Verifcation (PIV)  of Federal Employees and Contractors,  specifcations;  16  https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/Cryptographic-Module-Validation-Program https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/Cryptographic-Module-Validation-Program mailto:randall.easter@nist.gov mailto:serban.gavrila@nist.gov mailto:david.ferraiolo@nist.gov  NIST/ITL CYBERSECURITY PROGRAM ANNUAL REPORT 2017  • Pursued the standardization and  harmonization of identity standards that were  developed in the U.S.;  • Developed requirements and identifed  standards gaps for Mobile Driving Licenses;  • Actively participated in the development of a  standards for Mobile Driving Licenses;  • Enhanced the Machine-Readable Travel  Documents (ePassport) data model to  address privacy and security concerns; and  • Contributed to the development of a standard  for privacy-enhanced security protocols for  secure elements.  The ITL staf will continue to actively support  relevant ID management standard initiatives, such as  ISO/IEC 19286, Integrated circuit card (ICC) Privacy- enhancing protocols and services, and ISO/IEC 18328,  ICC managed devices.  Web Authentication/FIDO: ITL participates in the  development of online authentication specifcations.  These specifcations are developed by the Fast  Identities Online (FIDO) alliance, which is a consortium  of private organizations. ITL also participates in  the development of similar specifcations (called  WebAuthn) for web browsers that are being developed  by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). Both the  FIDO and WebAuthn specifcations enable relying  parties to create cryptographic tokens on the end- user’s device and subsequently use this cryptographic  token to authenticate the end user. These specifcations  provide multi-factor authentication directives, and  they are designed to mitigate common threat vectors  for Internet communications, such as phishing, man- in-the-middle, and replay attacks.  ePassport: ITL participates in the development  of an ISO/IEC standard (ISO/IEC 7501) for electronic  Passports. Specifcally, ITL is contributing to the  development of passport data structure and its access  control. ITL reviews and comments on authentication  protocols that are developed to ensure strong user  authentication and to protect personally identifable  passport data.  Mobile Driver License: ITL is also participating  in the development of an ISO standard (ISO/IEC  18013) for an International Mobile Driver License (DL).  ITL gathered and discussed functional and security  requirements for Mobile DLs, and is now developing  two models: ofine and online. Once these models are  fully defned, ITL plans to write technical specifcations  for each model.

The goal in these eforts is to promote a vibrant  market of internationally viable identity services and  advance the secure exchange of digital identities  while protecting the privacy of the subjects of those  identities for cross-border transactions and mutual  recognition. While primarily focused on developing a  framework that would facilitate the establishment of  a common set of requirements and standards across  the three national programs, there was increasing  interest from other national programs and industry  in the work products and methodologies developed  by this collaborative work. As a result, the group  provided this work to the international community as  a series of aligned joint contributions for international  standardization.  The TIG contributions, in collaboration with their  British and Canadian partners, were focused on  establishing a synchronized core set of international  identity management standards within the scope of  the activities of ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 27/WG 5, which  oversees the development of international standards  for identity management and privacy. The team  provided contributions to synchronize and align the  following ISO/IEC standards with the U.K., Canadian,  and U.S. harmonization work: 17  mailto:ketan.mehta@nist.gov mailto:salvatore.francomacaro@nist.gov  ITL CYBERSECURITY PROGRAM AND PROJECTS  |  FY 2017  • ISO/IEC 29115 Information Technology —  Security techniques — Entity authentication  assurance framework – a major revision is  required to align with SP 800-63 B and GPG  44;  • ISO/IEC 29003 Information technology —  Security techniques — Identity proofng;  • ISO 31000 Risk management framework  applied to identity-related risk, a new work  project for a new international standard that  will be aligned with the risk management  section of NIST SP 800-63-3;  • Identity related standards landscape, a new  work project to establish a clear and aligned  landscape for ISO/IEC identity standards and  administrative processes and to establish rules  for how the development and maintenance  of an aligned set of identity management  standards could be coordinated and managed  within ISO/IEC WG5; and  • Identity assurance framework, a new work  project for a new international standard that  will be aligned with the identity assurance  components of SP 800-63A and the U.K. GPG  45.  CONTACT:  Mr. David Temoshok  (202) 482-5475  david.temoshok@nist.gov  Blockchains  During FY 2017, NIST participated in standards  activities exploring blockchain technologies,  architectures, and use cases. These included  participation in a new blockchain study group  sponsored by the American Standards Committee  X9, the fnancial services committee of the American  National Standards Institute (ANSI), and continued  work in the International Standards Organization  (ISO) Technical Committee (TC) for Blockchains  and Distributed Ledger Technologies (ISO/TC 307).  Established in 2016, the initial objectives of ISO/TC 307  include defning key terms and concepts, exploring  reference architectures, investigating use cases, and  identifying identity and privacy implications within  blockchain technologies and architectures. NIST has  been participating in these activities via the national  mirror committee within the InterNational Committee  for Information Technology Standards (INCITS). ISO/  TC 307 will meet in November 2017, where the reports  on these topics will be reviewed and new work will be  established.

Focus was on the architecture, vocabulary, and  recently, edge computing. In addition to working on  standards related to these areas, NIST staf member  Eric Simmon is the chair of the IIC commenting  working group for reviewing the IEEE p2413 draft  standard and is the liaison between ISO/IEC SC41-  ISO/IEC SC38 (cloud computing).  The NIST staf has also participated to the activities  in ISO/IEC SC27 relative to IoT Security. This activity  will be further developed during FY 2018.

These participants include the Ofce  of Management and Budget (OMB) E-Gov Ofce and  Ofce of Information and Regulatory Afairs, the  federal Chief Information Ofcers (CIO) Council, the  Interagency Council on Standards Policy (ICSP), and  the General Services Administration (GSA) Ofce of  Government-wide Policy. Our goal in chairing the  Standards Working Group is to solicit requirements  from federal agencies, fnd the appropriate voluntary  standards committee that is addressing these  requirements and encourage participation to ensure  the government requirements are being adequately  met. Where standards are needed, ITL works  closely with U.S. industry, standards development  organizations, other government agencies, and  leaders in the global standards community to develop  standards that will support secure cloud computing.  ITL participation helps to ensure the alignment  of NIST standards with those of ISO/IEC JTC 1 sub- committees, such as SC 27 IT Security techniques,  SC 38 Cloud Computing and Distributed Platforms,  and their U.S. counterparts, ANSI/ INCITS Cyber  Security 1 (CS 1) and Cloud 38. The large number of  standards being developed in SC 27 covering areas  such as security, cryptography, privacy, supply chain,  personally identifable information (PII) processing  or virtualization security, harmonize with many cloud  computing standards being developed by these  subcommittees.  The focus of implementing cloud computing is  even more critical since the White House released  an IT Modernization Report in September 2017 that  includes recommendations for agencies to take  steps to secure and modernize federal IT networks.  Those steps for modernizing and consolidating  networks point to cloud computing, modernization of  government-hosted applications, and better security  for legacy systems. Federal modernization eforts,  such as those connected with the Modernizing  Government Technology Act, may further enable  agencies to accelerate investments in cloud and other  new technologies.  Ms. Annie Sokol is a member of ITL’s Cloud  Computing team and is the CSD representative in  the standards development program. ITL provides  technical and editorial representation in the  development of national and international standards  in both SC 27 and SC 38. Ms. Sokol is the co-editor  of ISO/IEC 19941, Information technology–Cloud  computing–Interoperability and portability, which  is expected to be published by the end of 2017.  The document is intended to establish a common  understanding of cloud computing interoperability  and portability. Both interoperability and portability  ofer more choices to cloud users by limiting the  efects of being locked-in to any cloud service or cloud  service provider. ISO/IEC 19941 joins many published  cloud computing standards that were developed from  NIST publications, such as:  • ISO/IEC 17788, Information technology --  Cloud computing -- Overview and vocabulary;  • ISO/IEC 17789, Information technology --  Cloud computing -- Reference architecture;  and,  • ISO/IEC 19086, Information technology --  Cloud computing -- Service level agreement  (SLA) framework.

This  EO directed NIST to work with stakeholders to develop  a voluntary framework – based on existing standards,  guidelines, and practices − for reducing cybersecurity  risks to critical infrastructures.  The Cybersecurity Framework that was  developed provides a prioritized, fexible, repeatable,  performance-based, and cost-efective approach to  help critical infrastructure owners and operators—as 19  mailto:annie.sokol@nist.gov  ITL CYBERSECURITY PROGRAM AND PROJECTS  |  FY 2017  well as other interested entities—identify, assess, and  manage cybersecurity-related risk while protecting  business confdentiality, individual privacy, and civil  liberties.  In FY 2017, NIST continued to work with a diverse  stakeholder community to support the use and  understanding of the Cybersecurity Framework. This  process included:  • Publication of a draft Framework 1.1 to clarify,  refne, and enhance the Cybersecurity  Framework, drawing upon comments received  from a public review process launched in  January 2017;  • Conducting a public workshop at NIST in  Gaithersburg, MD to gather input about the  current use of the Framework and feedback  regarding the initial public draft;  • Releasing the 1.0 version of the Baldrige  Cybersecurity Excellence Builder, a self- assessment tool to help organizations  better understand the efectiveness of their  cybersecurity risk-management eforts;  • Updates to the Framework website with a  catalog of industry resources, upcoming NIST  speaking events, and an extensive frequently- asked-question knowledge base;  • Provision of outreach for small- and medium- sized businesses (SMBs), including guidance  provided by the Applied Cybersecurity  Division (ACD) in NIST Interagency Report  (NISTIR) 7621 Rev. 1, Small Business  Information Security: The Fundamentals;  • Coordinating with critical infrastructure  owners and operators, regulators, and other  industry organizations through a variety of  meetings and industry events to ensure the  understanding and use of the Framework;  • Analyzing various industry work products  (such as mapping documents) for Framework  correctness;  • Consulting with state and local governments,  and the governments of other nations  regarding their alignment with both the  principles and the cybersecurity outcomes of  the Framework;  • Consulting with international organizations  and standards bodies to demonstrate and  ensure continued alignment with voluntary  international standards; and  • Working with both industry and regulatory  organizations to apply the Framework in  ways that bring efciencies to the regulatory  process.  Since the release of the Framework, NIST’s primary  goal has been to raise awareness of the Framework  and encourage its use as a tool to help industry  sectors and organizations manage cybersecurity risks.  NIST has strengthened its collaboration with critical  infrastructure owners and operators, industry leaders,  government partners, and other stakeholders—  building on previous years’ interactions that were  crucial to the Framework’s development.  In May 2017, Executive Order 13800 was released,  directing federal agency heads to use the Framework  to manage agencies’ cybersecurity risk. NIST released  draft NISTIR 8170, The Cybersecurity Framework:  Implementation Guidance for Federal Agencies, to  provide information on how Federal agencies can use  the Cybersecurity Framework—and in particular, how  the Risk Management Framework and Cybersecurity  Framework work together to help agencies  develop, implement, and continuously improve their  information security programs.  In FY 2018, NIST will continue to conduct  stakeholder outreach and will work collaboratively  to further understand stakeholder needs regarding  tools and resources to enable more efective use  of the Framework. Version 1.1 of the Framework is  expected to be published, and NIST will continue to  identify ways for the Framework to contribute to risk  management initiatives.

During FY 2017, the ITL FISMA Implementation  project continued to strengthen collaboration through  the Joint Task Force (JTF) Transformation Initiative,  which includes the Department of Defense (DoD),  the Intelligence Community (IC), the Committee on  National Security Systems (CNSS), and various federal  agencies. The JTF partners continue to develop and  update key cybersecurity guidelines for protecting  federal information and information systems as  part of the Unifed Information Security Framework.  Previously, the JTF developed common security  guidance in the critical areas of security controls  for information systems and organizations, security  assessment procedures to demonstrate security  control efectiveness, security authorizations for risk  acceptance decisions, and continuous monitoring  activities to ensure that decision makers receive the  most up-to-date information on the security state of  their information systems. In addition, ITL continued  to work with the Department of Homeland Security  (DHS) to develop guidelines for automation support  for security control assessments on a security  capability basis and in accordance with the NIST RMF  as well as on developing guidance and a security  controls overlay to protect federal high value assets.  In FY 2017, the ITL FISMA Team worked on the  following initiatives:  • System Security Engineering Initiative:  The fnal version of Special Publication (SP)  800-160, Systems Security Engineering:  Considerations for a Multidisciplinary  Approach in the Engineering of Trustworthy  Secure Systems, was published to address  the engineering-driven actions necessary  to develop more defensible and survivable  systems—including the components that  compose and the services that depend on  those systems. To ensure that the publication  provides the utmost clarity and focus for  our customers, several of the supporting  appendices from the second public draft are  being recast into their own publications. SP  800-160 is the fagship publication for the  NIST Systems Security Engineering Initiative.  NIST publications specifcally addressing  several key systems security engineering  considerations (i.e., resilience, software  assurance, and hardware assurance) will be  developed and published, beginning in 2018.  Additionally, the interaction of the NIST RMF  with the life cycle processes in SP 800-160,  will be described in future updates to existing  RMF standards and guidelines.  • Risk Management Guidelines: Work  continued on SP 800-53 Revision 5, Security  and Privacy Controls for Information Systems  and Organizations. The initial public draft  was published after collaboration with a  federal interagency working group, the OMB,  NIST, other agency privacy professionals,  and our JTF partners. SP 800-53 provides  organizations with the security and privacy  controls necessary to appropriately strengthen  their systems and the environments in  which those systems operate, and provides  a process for selecting the appropriate  controls, which contributes to systems that  are resilient in the face of attacks and other  threats and protect an individual’s privacy.  The FISMA Team, in conjunction with the  same group of collaborators, also published  a discussion draft of SP 800-37 Revision 2,  Risk Management Framework for Information  Systems and Organizations. SP 800-37  Revision 2 provides a closer link between risk 21  https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/Risk-Management https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/Risk-Management  ITL CYBERSECURITY PROGRAM AND PROJECTS  |  FY 2017  management processes and activities at the  executive level of the organization, with risk  management activities at the system and  operational level; institutionalizes enterprise- wide risk management preparatory activities  to facilitate a more efcient and cost- efective execution of the Risk Management  Framework at the system and operational  level; demonstrates how the Cybersecurity  Framework can be implemented using the  established Risk Management Framework  processes; and integrates privacy concepts  into the Risk Management Framework. The  implementation of SP 800-53, SP 800-37, and  SP 800-137, Information Security Continuous  Monitoring for Federal Information Systems  and Organizations, provides organizations  with near real-time information that is  essential for senior leaders making ongoing  risk-based decisions afecting their critical  missions and business functions.  • FISMA Outreach Activity to Public and  Private-Sector Organizations: Cybersecurity  outreach briefngs were conducted and  support was provided to all levels of private- sector organizations and government  (including federal, state and local entities) on  multiple information security topics of interest.  These included, for example, an efective  implementation of the NIST RMF, contingency  planning, interconnection security  agreements, security-focused confguration  management, and information security for  small businesses. In addition, the ITL FISMA  Team responded to hundreds of inquiries from  customers, served on cybersecurity advisory  panels, conducted outreach activities with  academic institutions, provided information on  NIST’s security standards and guidelines, and  explored new areas of cybersecurity research  and development.  • Collaboration with JTF partners and  other federal organizations: The FISMA  Team worked closely with JTF partners to  ensure that the fve JTF publications remain  current, and to designate additional Special  Publications as JTF guidance. The fve JTF  publications are:  1. SP 800-30, Guide for Conducting Risk  Assessments;  2. SP 800-37, Guide for Applying the Risk  Management Framework to Federal  Information Systems: a Security Life Cycle  Approach;  3. SP 800-39, Managing Information  Security Risk: Organization, Mission, and  Information System View;  4. SP 800-53, Security and Privacy Controls  for Federal Information Systems and  Organizations; and  5. SP 800-53A, Assessing Security and  Privacy Controls in Federal Information  Systems and Organizations: Building  Efective Assessment Plans.  The FISMA Team also collaborated with DoD,  the IC, DHS, the National Archives and Records  Administration (NARA), the Federal Emergency  Management Agency (FEMA), the Government  Accountability Ofce (GAO), the OMB, the General  Services Administration (GSA), the Small Business  Administration (SBA), and the Inspectors General  (IGs) on multiple projects to ensure consistency with  FISMA-related guidance and to protect information in  a way that is commensurate with risk. In addition, the  FISMA Team served as co-chairs on the CNSS working  groups.  In FY 2017, the FISMA Team completed the  following activities:  • Published the fnal version of SP 800-160,  Systems Security Engineering: Considerations  for a Multidisciplinary Approach in the  Engineering of Trustworthy Secure Systems;  • Published the initial public draft of SP 800-53  Revision 5, Security and Privacy Controls for  Systems and Organizations;  • Published the discussion draft of SP 800-37  Revision 2, Risk Management Framework for  Federal Information Systems: A System Life  Cycle Approach for Security and Privacy;  • Published the fnal version of SP 800-171  Revision 1, Protecting Controlled Unclassifed 22  NIST/ITL CYBERSECURITY PROGRAM ANNUAL REPORT 2017  Information in Nonfederal Information Systems  and Organizations, to provide guidance  to federal agencies for the protection of  Controlled Unclassifed Information when such  information is resident in nonfederal systems  and organizations;  • Published fnal versions of NIST Interagency  Report (NISTIR) 8011, Automation Support for  Ongoing Assessments, Volume 1 - Overview,  and Volume 2 - Hardware Asset Management,  and adjudicated public comments in  partnership with DHS;  • Published the fnal version of An Introduction  to Information Security;  • Continued the development of a web  application to automate the process for  updating SP 800-53 in order to keep it as  current and relevant as possible;  • Continued the development of SP 800- 60, Revision 2, Guide for Mapping Types  of Information and Information Systems to  Security Categories, in partnership with the  National Archives and Records Administration  (NARA);  • Continued the development of the initial  public draft of SP 800-18 Revision 2, Guide for  Developing System Security and Privacy Plans;  and  • Continued the development of the  initial public draft of SP 800-47 Revision  1, Information Exchange and System  Connections.  In FY 2018, the FISMA Team intends to:  • Continue work on SP 800-160 companion  publications;  • Finalize and publish the fnal version of SP  800-53 Revision 5, Security and Privacy  Controls for Information Systems and  Organizations;  • Finalize and publish the fnal version of  SP 800-37 Revision 2, Risk Management  Framework for Federal Information Systems:  A System Life Cycle Approach for Security and  Privacy;  • Complete the development of and  operationalize the web application for the  automated support of SP 800-53 updates and  the public comment process;  • Continue the collaboration with DHS to  develop and publish additional NISTIR 8011  volumes;  • Finalize and publish the initial public draft  of SP 800-60 Revision 2, Guide for Mapping  Types of Information and Information Systems  to Security Categories, in partnership with  NARA and OMB;  • Publish the initial public draft and fnal version  of SP 800-53A, Assessing Security and  Privacy Controls in Information Systems and  Organizations;  • Publish the initial public draft and fnal version  of SP 800-171A, Assessing Security Controls in  Nonfederal Systems;  • Continue the development of SP 800-18  Revision 2, Guide for Developing System  Security and Privacy Plans;  • Finalize and publish SP 800-47 Revision  1, Information Exchange and System  Connections;  • Update the RMF online course to Hypertext  Markup Language version 5 (HTML5) and  verify consistency with SP 800-37 Revision 2;  • Expand cybersecurity outreach to include  additional state, local, and tribal governments,  as well as private-sector organizations and  academic institutions;  • Continue to support federal agencies in the  efective implementation of the RMF; and  • Continue the collaboration with JTF partners  and other federal organizations.

Privacy Engineering Program  The NIST Privacy Engineering Program (PEP)  supports the development of trustworthy information  systems by applying measurement science and system  engineering principles to the creation of frameworks,  risk models, guidance, tools, and standards that  protect privacy and, by extension, civil liberties.  In FY 2017, the PEP focused on advancing  the development of privacy engineering and risk  management processes and the deployment  of privacy-enhancing technologies (as well as  positioning NIST as a leader in privacy research).  Many of the PEP’s eforts in FY 2017 were fueled  by the OMB’s July 2016 update to Circular  A-130, which emphasized federal agencies’  responsibilities to manage privacy risk, not just  compliance risk, and now requires them to apply the  NIST Risk Management Framework to their privacy  programs.  Advancement of Privacy Engineering and Risk  Management  In January 2017, the PEP reached a major  milestone in advancing the development of privacy  engineering and risk management processes with the  fnalization of NISTIR 8062, An Introduction to Privacy  Engineering and Risk Management in Federal Systems  (see https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.IR.8062). NISTIR  8062 introduces the concept of applying systems  engineering practices to privacy and provides a  new model for conducting privacy risk assessments  on federal systems. It also presents the PEP’s initial  roadmap (See Figure 3) for guidance development to  help agencies more efectively meet new obligations  under the revised Circular A-130.  In FY 2017, the PEP team collaborated with  internal and external partners to successfully integrate  privacy requirements and considerations into SP 800- 63-3, Digital Identity Guidelines. The PEP team also  collaborated to integrate privacy into the draft revisions  of SPs 800-53, Revision 5, Security and Privacy  Controls for Information Systems and Organizations,  and 800-37, Revision 2, Risk Management Framework  for Information Systems and Organizations, building  the foundation of making privacy and security equal  Figure 3: PEP guidance roadmap for integrating privacy risk management into NIST SPs, featuring  integrations underway during FY 2017 (highlighted in green).  24  mailto:sec-cert@nist.gov https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.IR.8062 mailto:kelley.dempsey@nist.gov mailto:jody.jacobs@nist.gov mailto:nedim.goren@nist.gov mailto:victoria.pillitteri@nist.gov mailto:ron.ross@nist.gov  NIST/ITL CYBERSECURITY PROGRAM ANNUAL REPORT 2017  quality attributes in trustworthy systems. The PEP  team also contributed privacy concepts to the Trusted  Identities Group (TIG) measurement science efort,  draft NISTIR 8112, Attribute Metadata.  The PEP team also contributed to ongoing  standards and framework development eforts in  the International Organization for Standardization  (ISO), Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers  (IEEE), and the Fast Identity Online (FIDO) Alliance.  Specifcally, the PEP team worked on ISO/IEC 27552,  which is a privacy-focused sector-specifc extension  of  the information security-focused ISO/IEC 27001,  and ISO/IEC 27550, a technical report on privacy  engineering. The PEP team also supported the  development of IEEE P7002, an efort in its early  stages that also addresses privacy engineering. The  PEP team also engaged with FIDO to help develop  privacy-enhancing authentication specifcations.  Continuing the ongoing series of NIST workshops  on privacy engineering and risk management,  building of the concepts introduced in NISTIR 8062,  the PEP team hosted the June 2017 workshop,  “Privacy Risk Assessment: A Prerequisite for Privacy  Risk Management” (see https://www.nist.gov/news- events/events/2017/06/privacy-risk-assessment- prerequisite-privacy-risk-management). Feedback  received included the need for further integration of  privacy into risk management and security guidance,  a privacy-specifc risk assessment model, and a toolset  to manage privacy risk. These takeaways aligned well  with the PEP team’s ongoing eforts and goals for  future work.  In support of a privacy-specifc risk assessment  tool, the PEP team continued socializing the use of  its Privacy Risk Assessment Methodology (PRAM)  inside and outside the Federal Government. As of  FY 2017, more than 30 public- and private-sector  organizations have used or are using the PRAM,  including participants in NIST’s trusted identities  pilots and a few federal agencies.  The PEP team also collaborated on projects at the  National Cybersecurity Center of Excellence (NCCoE),  including the Privacy-Enhancing Identity Federation  building block, which demonstrates the use of the  NIST privacy engineering objectives (see https://  nccoe.nist.gov/projects/building-blocks/privacy- enhanced-identity-brokers).  NIST Leadership in Privacy  The PEP team built upon NIST’s leadership role  in privacy by serving in leadership positions and  contributing to privacy expertise organizations across  the public and private sectors. These leadership  positions included: the chair of the Federal Privacy  Council’s Risk Management Task Force and co-chair of  the Networking and Information Technology Research  and Development (NITRD) Program’s Privacy  Research and Development (R&D) Interagency  Working Group. The PEP team also participated in the  Internet Policy Task Force’s Privacy Working Group,  the FIDO Alliance’s Privacy and Public Policy Working  Group, and the Identity Ecosystem Steering Group.  Looking Forward  In FY 2018, the PEP team will continue developing  privacy risk management guidance for agencies,  including fnalizing SP 800-53 Revision 5, and SP  800-37 Revision 2. The PEP team will also collaborate  with internal and external stakeholders to kick of  the integration of privacy guidance into SP 800-53A  Revision 5, Assessing Security and Privacy Controls  in Federal Information Systems and Organizations,  and implement the provisions of other documents  laid out in the guidance roadmap. The PEP team will  continue supporting the development of international  standards focused on privacy engineering and risk  management.  The PEP team will place a greater focus on  its goal of advancing the deployment of privacy- enhancing technologies. The PEP team has already  begun exploring whether stakeholders see a need  for an online space where collaborators can discuss,  learn about, and improve upon tools, solutions, and  processes that support privacy engineering and  risk management. The PEP team will also explore  the management of privacy risk in leading-edge  domains, such as the internet of things (IoT) and  artifcial intelligence (AI). Specifcally, the PEP team  will collaborate with NIST’s Cybersecurity for the IoT  program to tackle IoT-specifc privacy challenges  through workshops and guidance.  The PEP team will continue to seek leadership  opportunities in public- and private-sector organizations  to strengthen NIST’s position as a leader in privacy.  Finally, the PEP team will continue working with a  25  https://www.nist.gov/news-events/events/2017/06/privacy-risk-assessment-prerequisite-privacy-risk-management https://www.nist.gov/news-events/events/2017/06/privacy-risk-assessment-prerequisite-privacy-risk-management https://www.nist.gov/news-events/events/2017/06/privacy-risk-assessment-prerequisite-privacy-risk-management https://nccoe.nist.gov/projects/building-blocks/privacy-enhanced-identity-brokers https://nccoe.nist.gov/projects/building-blocks/privacy-enhanced-identity-brokers https://nccoe.nist.gov/projects/building-blocks/privacy-enhanced-identity-brokers  ITL CYBERSECURITY PROGRAM AND PROJECTS  |  FY 2017  variety of organizations to manage privacy risk using  the PRAM, such as using it in the NCCoE’s Mobile  Device Security building block.

This ecosystem is composed of  assorted entities with multiple tiers of outsourcing,  global distribution routes, diverse technologies, and  varying laws, policies, procedures, and practices, all of  which interact throughout the life cycle of a system.  Factors that allow for low-cost products, rapid  innovation, and other benefts also increase the risk  that the supply chain may be compromised in a way  that results in risks to the end user and reduce the  overall competitiveness of U.S. companies.  Cyber Supply Chain Risk Management (C-SCRM)  lies at the intersection of information security, supply  chain management, and enterprise risk management  (Figure 4); it is the process of identifying, assessing,  and mitigating the risks associated with the distributed  and interconnected nature of IT/OT product and  service supply chains. C-SCRM covers the entire life  cycle of a system (including design, development,  maintenance, and destruction), as supply chain threats  and vulnerabilities may intentionally or unintentionally  compromise an IT/OT product or service at any  stage. These cyber supply chain risks may include  the use of counterfeits, unauthorized production,  tampering, theft, and insertion of malicious software  and hardware, as well as poor manufacturing and  development practices. As shown in Figure 5, C-SCRM  is concerned with and involves a range of subjects,  including safety, integrity, quality, reliability, and  others, all within an overall environment of awareness.  Figure 5: C-SCRM Aspects  In FY 2017, NIST drafted NISTIR 8179, Criticality  Analysis Process Model, a method for identifying  and prioritizing IT/OT systems and components. This  model is intended to increase an organization’s ability  to make cost-efective risk decisions by determining  the systems and components that have the most  impact on the organization and that would potentially  cause the most harm if compromised. Figure 6 shows  an overview of the model, which includes separate  analyses at the program, system, and component  level, and then a trace-back exercise to complete the  analysis. NIST will fnalize this publication in FY 2018  and will begin to research and write guidance that  builds on this model to identify critical suppliers and  service providers.  26  https://www.nist.gov/itl/privacy-engineering mailto:privacyeng@nist.gov mailto:kaitlin.boeckl@nist.gov mailto:ellen.nadeau@nist.gov mailto:naomi.lefkovitz@nist.gov  NIST/ITL CYBERSECURITY PROGRAM ANNUAL REPORT 2017  .

Trace back  Figure 6: Criticality Analysis Process Overview  During 2017, NIST continued to research the state of  C-SCRM in both the public and private sectors, related  standards and initiatives, efective practices, and  metrics. NIST joined with the GSA and the University  of Maryland under a contract and grant awarded in  FY 2016 to conduct cyber analytics research on the  efectiveness of various risk management practices.  The efort neared conclusion in FY 2017 and found  correlations between certain practices and publicly  disclosed data breaches. A report on the research will  be published in FY 2018.  Similarly, NIST began research in FY 2017  to identify metrics that are currently used in  organizations to measure information security risks.  This research included a review of over 200 published  standards, academic papers, organizational white- papers, and other documents and interviews with a  dozen industry experts on the state of metrics in this  feld. The research will be continued and published in  FY 2018.  NIST continued to co-chair a working group  with the DoD to revise CNSSD 505, Supply Chain  Risk Management, which assigns responsibilities and  establishes minimum criteria for the development  and deployment of supply chain risk management  capabilities for national security systems. In FY 2017,  the group completed the revision of CNSSD 505 and  developed a self-assessment tool to help agencies  measure their capabilities and compare those  capabilities to those of other agencies.  NIST also sponsored the Software and Supply  Chain Assurance (SSCA) Forum and Working Groups,  the purpose of which is to bring together a stakeholder  community of government, industry, and academic  experts in this feld. Meetings are held three to four  times a year and cover a variety of subjects of interest  to attendees (see the website at https://csrc.nist.gov/  scrm/ssca).  NIST began working in FY 2017 to integrate  C-SCRM into existing risk management programs and  processes. The draft Cybersecurity Framework v1.1  and Draft SP 800-53 Revision 5 were both updated  to better include up-to-date C-SCRM guidance. In  FY 2018, NIST will continue this work by including  or updating existing C-SCRM concepts in other  publications as they are developed.  27  https://csrc.nist.gov/scrm/ssca https://csrc.nist.gov/scrm/ssca  ITL CYBERSECURITY PROGRAM AND PROJECTS  |  FY 2017  In FY 2018, NIST will continue to collaborate with  stakeholders in government, industry, and academia  to conduct research, produce needed standards and  guidance, and seek opportunities to create greater  awareness across all sectors and types and sizes of  organizations. NIST will:  • Update SP 800-161 based on the fnal  publication of SP 800-53 Revision 5,  • Continue developing industry supply chain  risk management case studies,  • Develop a draft NISTIR on SCRM “principles”,  • Develop a NISTIR on Supply Chain  Interdependency Analysis, and  • Continue research and work on metrics and  cyber risk analytics.

The Software and Supply Chain Assurance  (SSCA) Forum provides a venue for government,  industry, and academic participants from around  the world to share their knowledge and expertise  regarding cyber supply chain risks, efective practices  and mitigation strategies, tools and technologies,  and any gaps related to the people, processes, or  technologies involved.  The efort, initiated in 2003, is co-led by NIST,  DHS, DoD and GSA, and serves approximately 3,000  stakeholders. Participants represent a diverse group  of career professionals, including government ofcials,  chief information security ofcers, those in academia  with cybersecurity and supply chain specialties,  system administrators, engineers, consultants,  vendors, software developers, managers, analysts,  specialists in IT and cybersecurity, and many more  felds. The SSCA Forum meets two to three times per  year and is free and open to all interested participants,  both nationally and internationally.  While the general intent is to share information,  the SSCA Forum also ofers government and  private-sector participants an opportunity to openly  collaborate by presenting and receiving feedback on  current and potential future work. Most events are two  to three days long and contain a mixture of discussion  and presentation. To encourage open interaction,  SSCA Forum meetings operate under the Chatham  House Rule, meaning “participants are free to use  the information received, but neither the identity nor  the afliation of the speaker(s), nor that of any other  participant, may be revealed,” though most speakers  allow NIST to post their presentations.

S\\, •  BIOMETRIC STANDARDS AND  ASSOCIATED CONFORMITY  ASSESSMENT TESTING TOOLS  ITL supports the development of biometric  conformance testing methodology standards and  other conformity assessment eforts through active  technical participation in the development of these  standards and the development of associated  conformance test software, architectures and test  suites, collectively known as Biometric Conformance  Test Software (BioCTS). These test tools are developed  to promote the adoption of these standards and  to support users, product developers, and testing  labs that require conformance to selected biometric  standards. ITL contributes to the development of  biometric standards and participates in the INCITS  Technical Committee M1 – Biometrics and related  subcommittees and in ISO/IEC Joint Technical  Committee (JTC) 1 Subcommittee (SC) 37 – Biometrics  standards bodies.  In early 2017, a suite of BioCTS applications was  released to support user-defned requirements and  profles for ANSI/NIST-ITL (AN-ITL) specifcations.  These applications make use of confguration fles to  dynamically generate parsing rules and conformance  requirements for nearly any version or profle of the  AN-ITL standard. The confguration fles utilize an  Extensible Markup Language (XML)-based format  called ANSI/NIST-ITL Machine Readable Tables (MRTs)  (see Figure 7 for an example output). The BioCTS AN- ITL applications that use MRTs are collectively referred  to as BioCTS AN MRT.  The development of BioCTS applications  traditionally relied on the publication of Conformance  Testing Methodology (CTM) documentation, which  specifed the test assertions required to assess  conformance to requirements found in the related  biometric  standard. Manual software development  was then required to code each of the assertions listed  in the CTM documentation. This process required  a large amount of development time after the  publication of the standard and related CTM, and often  resulted in long delays in the release of conformance  tools. This approach also defned conformance tests  statically, meaning that:  • End users with domain-specifc requirements  or user-defned felds were not able to modify  the conformance tests or parsing rules.  • Any modifcation to the base standard  requirements or subsequent revision of the  standard required a new release of BioCTS  applications.  To alleviate these issues, the new version of  BioCTS was designed to allow a modifcation of test  assertions and parsing rules. This approach required  a confguration fle to specify requirements and allow  the software to respond to the needs of the end user.  BioCTS AN MRT had two releases in FY 2017.  The frst release included a command line interface  (CLI) as well as a graphical user interface (GUI). It  supported Level-1 testing, fle format testing that  checks for the allowed content, length, and value for  fve diferent standards and profles specifed within  the AN MRTs. Since the MRT fles can be combined  to support multiple standards, updates and profles,  BioCTS AN MRT was designed to allow users to test  against multiple standards during a single test.  Figure 7 - BioCTS AN MRT Testing Multiple  Standards Within Single Test 29  ITL CYBERSECURITY PROGRAM AND PROJECTS  |  FY 2017  The second release included further refnements  of the existing tools, and expanded the testing  capabilities to include Level-2 testing, or the testing  of inter-feld as well as inter-record relationships,  checking data between two or more related data  felds. The current release of BioCTS AN MRT supports  all Level-1 and Level-2 tests defned by the MRTs.  Work on BioCTS AN MRT continued through FY  2017, and an additional release that supports expanded  character sets, as well as additional enhancements, is  expected to be released in FY 2018.

HAVA  established the Election Assistance Commission  (EAC) and the Technical Guidelines Development  Committee (TGDC), chaired by the Director of NIST.  HAVA directs NIST to provide technical support to the  EAC and TGDC in eforts related to human factors,  security, and laboratory accreditation.  NIST and the EAC established a set of public  working groups to inform the development of a new  version of the Volunary Voting Systems Guidelines  (VVSG). The NIST and EAC goals are to accelerate  the development and adoption of the VVSG by  leading these working groups in close consultation  with election ofcials, voting system manufacturers,  standards bodies, academic researchers, and other  members of the public. These working groups focus  on multiple voting system technology areas, including  accessibility, usability, interoperability, security, testing  and certifcation.  The cybersecurity public working group designed  principles and guidelines to form the basis for the  security requirements in the new version of the VVSG.  Although 15 principles exist, the security-related  principles include auditability, ballot secrecy, physical  security, access control, system integrity, detection  and monitoring, and data protection. Many of these  principles are already included in previous iterations  of the federal standards, whereas others are new  areas of focus (e.g., system integrity). These principles  and guidelines were presented to, and adopted by, the  Technical Guidelines and Development Committee  (TGDC).  In FY 2018, NIST will continue leading the public  working groups to inform the development of  voting system requirements based on the principles  and guidelines. Additionally, test assertions will be  developed to improve the quality and consistency  of testing activities by accredited voting system test  laboratories (VSTLs).

PSCR  t SECURITY  Nationwide Public Safety Broadband  Network (NPSBN) Cybersecurity  Source: https://www.pscr.gov/  In February 2012, Congress passed the Middle  Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act. One portion  of this legislation calls for the establishment of a  nationwide, interoperable public-safety broadband  network based on the 3rd Generation Partnership  Project’s (3GPP) Long Term Evolution (LTE)  technology. The network will be deployed and  operated by the First Responder Network Authority  (FirstNet). The planned Nationwide Public Safety  Broadband Network (NPSBN) will “create a much  needed nationwide interoperable broadband network  that will help police, frefghters, emergency medical  service professionals and other public safety ofcials  stay safe and do their jobs” (see https://www.ntia.  doc.gov/category/public-safety). NIST is directed to  conduct research and development that supports  the acceleration and advancement of the nationwide  network.  In FY 2017, CSD, ACD, and the NCCoE continued  to support the joint National Telecommunications  and Information Administration (NTIA) and NIST  Public Safety Communications Research (PSCR)  program (see  https://www.pscr.gov) with eforts in  public-safety mobile-application security, identity  management, data and application isolation  technologies, wearable devices, and broadband  standards. The PSCR’s Annual Public Safety Broadband  Stakeholder Conference, held in June 2017, continued  to be a valuable venue for ITL to provide updates on  each of our ongoing projects. The conference also  provided a venue to directly interface with the public  safety and frst responder communities.  The mobile devices that will operate on the NPSBN  will be utilized in unique ways when compared to their  public counterparts. The same device(s) will likely  be shared between public safety ofcials as each  individual goes on and of duty. Furthermore, there will  be a need for fexible distribution and credentialing of  devices and users in situations where multiple public  safety organizations are called into action. To facilitate  these needs NIST, through the NCCoE, piloted a  proof-of-concept single sign on (SSO) for mobile  applications on iOS and Android.  Due to the vital nature of frst responder activities,  the mobile applications that will serve public safety  in their mission will require more scrutiny when  evaluated for software bugs and vulnerabilities  than applications targeted at the public. In FY 2017,  NIST continued to expand its expertise in mobile  application vetting tools and practices. In addition  to publishing NISTIR 8136, An Overview of Mobile  Application Vetting Services for Public Safety, ACD, in  conjunction with NIST Software and System’s Division  (SSD), expanded the Static Analysis Tool Exposition  (SATE) to include mobile application analysis for the  frst time. This exposition seeks to improve methods  for measuring the efectiveness of mobile application  vetting tools.  ITL continued to participate in the standards  development process for LTE technology within the  3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP), supporting  security requirements for public safety that are related  to Proximity Services (ProSe), Group Communication  System Enablers (GCSE), and Mission Critical Push-To- Talk (MCPTT). NIST also broadened its participation  in 3GPP’s 5th Generation Mobile Networks (5G). In  addition, researchers broadened their scope within  the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) to include  eforts related to public safety.  In FY 2018, CSD and ACD will continue to  strengthen NIST’s relationship with both public  safety and commercial telecom stakeholders. Work  concerning mobile application vetting and cyber  security will continue to evolve as NIST refnes both  its methods for tool evaluation as well as its corpus  of test cases used in those evaluations. PSCR is  working diligently to fund grants and prize challenges  to both solve current problems and fll future gaps  in public safety broadband technology. In FY 2018,  ITL will also take on a crucial role in this work by  providing cybersecurity expertise and guidance in the  administration of these awards. 31  https://www.pscr.gov/ https://www.ntia.doc.gov/category/public-safety https://www.ntia.doc.gov/category/public-safety https://www.pscr.gov  ITL CYBERSECURITY PROGRAM AND PROJECTS  |  FY 2017  CONTACTS:  Mr. Michael Ogata  Dr. Nelson Hastings  (301) 975-6993  (301) 975-5237  michael.ogata@nist.gov nelson.hastings@nist.gov  Cybersecurity for Industrial Control  Systems  NIST’s Industrial Control System (ICS)  cybersecurity efort is focused on providing guidance  and insights into the domain of securing connected  physical systems. ACD is supporting the NIST  Engineering Laboratory’s (EL) efort to develop and  implement guidance aimed at efectively securing  ICS, initially focusing on Smart Manufacturing  Environments. Using an ICS cybersecurity testbed,  a portion of which is shown in Figure 8, NIST will  measure the network and operational performance of  these systems when instrumented with cybersecurity  protections, in accordance with the best practices  and requirements prescribed by national and  international standards and guidelines. Examples of  such standards and guidelines include International  Society of Automation (ISA) standard ISA/IEC-62443  and SP 800-82 Revision 2, Guide to Industrial Control  Systems (ICS) Security (see https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/  nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-82r2.pdf).  Industrial Control Systems are an essential  component in manufacturing environments.  Increasing reliance on technology, communication,  and the interconnectivity of ICS and IT has expanded  the potential vulnerabilities and increased the  potential risk to manufacturing operations. While  these manufacturing systems become smarter and  increasingly connected, providing a tremendous  increase in value and efciency, they also present  a new challenge: “How is cybersecurity efectively  applied to this connected domain?”  Figure 8: Collaborative robotics portion of the ICS  cybersecurity testbed  The ICS cybersecurity team has used existing  standards, in conjunction with the NIST Framework  for Improving Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity, to  develop a target profle for applying cybersecurity  protections within manufacturing environments. The  development of this profle helps establish a roadmap  for reducing cybersecurity risk for manufacturers  that is aligned with manufacturing sector goals and  industry best practices. The profle tailors existing  cybersecurity control language to be more aligned  with operational technology environments, focusing  on desired cybersecurity outcomes to identify  opportunities for improving the current cybersecurity  posture of a manufacturing system. Through a session  during the 2016 Cybersecurity Framework Workshop  and two public comment periods, the team solicited  feedback from industry partners to help solidify the  content in the profle. The Cybersecurity Framework  Manufacturing Profle was published as NISTIR 8183  (see https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/ir/2017/NIST.  IR.8183.pdf).  In 2018, NIST will continue the process of applying  the guidance presented in the Manufacturing Profle  by implementing the recommended cybersecurity  controls within the ICS cybersecurity testbed.  This application of cybersecurity controls in an  ICS environment will enable the measuring and  understanding of the network and operational  performance impacts that cybersecurity protections  have on these systems. In addition to providing  performance data, this project will produce  documentation relating to the implementation  intricacies and special requirements presented by  these non-traditional environments.

The NIST Smart  Grid program is led by the Engineering Laboratory  (EL) with support from the Physical Measurement and  Information Technology Laboratories. The objective  of the program is to advance the measurement  science that will increase asset utilization and  efciency, improve grid reliability, and enable greater  use of renewable energy sources in the grid through  research, standardization, testing and implementation  of the NIST Smart Grid Interoperability Framework.  In the Spring of 2017, the Smart Grid Interoperability  Panel (SGIP) merged with the Smart Electric Power  Alliance (SEPA). SEPA’s Smart Grid Cybersecurity  Committee (SGCC) is led by an ITL representative.  The SGCC conducts regular outreach regarding  cybersecurity issues related to the smart grid,  including such topics as identity and key management.  Examples of this outreach include bi-weekly calls and  support to the SEPA Grid Evolution Summit held on  July 25-27, 2017 in Washington, D.C., where the SGCC  held its annual face-to-face meeting and included a  presentation on the public key infrastructure by ACD’s  Tim Polk. In addition to participating in SEPA’s SGCC,  CSD and ACD personnel are participating in SEPA’s  OpenFMB working groups to support cybersecurity  capabilities.  In FY 2017, researchers from ITL worked on  defning a grid edge experiment to understand the  performance impact of cybersecurity capabilities  on resource-constrained components of the grid. In  addition, researchers explored how to leverage and  incorporate cybersecurity risk management into  the next version of the Smart Grid Interoperability  Framework. ITL experts supported the Department  of Energy (DoE) Cyber Resilient Energy Delivery  Consortium (CREDC) program by participating in their  Annual Industry Workshop in Tempe, AZ and program  peer review held in Washington, D.C. Through a grant  to the University of New Hampshire, NIST supported  research into adding security mechanisms to the IEEE  1588 Precision Time Protocol (PTP).  In FY 2018, ITL will continue to coordinate with EL  and the Smart Grid Program in the development of the  next version of the NIST Smart Grid Interoperability  Framework 2.0 and in an execution of the grid edge  experiment on the NIST Smart Grid Testbed. ITL  will continue to chair SEPA’s SGCC and support the  DoE CREDC program, and will look for and explore  opportunities to collaborate with the National  Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) about smart  grid cybersecurity.

To develop processes  that deliver high-quality software, it is vital to be able  to fnd, characterize, and categorize vulnerabilities,  weaknesses, and faults that appear in code. Processes  can then be improved to preclude these faults, detect  them earlier, or build in mitigations for them. The  NIST Software Assurance Metrics And Tool Evaluation  (SAMATE) program promotes efective software  assurance processes and also evaluates methods for  automated tools to provide confdence that software  is free from vulnerabilities. The SAMATE program has  three primary components: the Software Assurance  Reference Dataset (SARD), the Static Analysis Tool  Exposition (SATE), and the Bugs Framework (BF).  SARD is a public repository of hundreds of  thousands of computer programs with known security  faws (see https://samate.nist.gov/SARD). The  programs are primarily in fve computer languages,  C, C++, Java, PHP, and C#, and include synthetic test  cases (small programs written as tests), open-source  production programs, and production programs with  vulnerabilities injected. See Figure 9 for a graph of the  size, type, and languages of the test cases.

NIST  remained committed to the value of communicating  its R&D eforts to other federal colleagues and  identifying the opportunities to support R&D eforts  throughout the Federal Government.  NIST is a consistent presence at the monthly  cybersecurity meetings with Bill Newhouse, National  Cybersecurity Center of Excellence (NCCoE) Security  Engineer and the National Initiative for Cybersecurity  Education (NICE) Deputy Director, as the co-chair  of the Cyber Security and Information Assurance  Interagency Working Group (CSIA IWG). During  FY 2017, NIST provided updates to the CSIA IWG  describing the updates to the NIST Cybersecurity  Framework, SP 800-53, Security and Privacy Controls  for Information Systems and Organizations, and the  NICE program.  Naomi Lefkowitz, Senior Privacy Policy Advisor  at NIST, co-chairs the Privacy R&D IWG, which  coordinates the multidisciplinary research and  development conducted by NITRD agencies that seek  to produce knowledge and technologies that identify  and mitigate emerging risks to our privacy, and that  enables individuals, companies, and the government  to beneft from technological advancements while  being able to efectively balance the resulting benefts  with resulting risks to privacy. The activity involves  research into and development of methods for  characterizing privacy expectations, understanding  privacy violations, engineering privacy-protecting  systems, recovering from privacy violations, and the  impact of privacy on public policy and of public policy  on privacy.  Ram Sriram is the co-chair of NITRD’s Software  Productivity, Sustainability, and Quality (SPSQ)  Interagency Working Group (IWG). Robert B. Bohn  is the co-chair of NITRD’s Faster Administration of  S&T Education and Research (FASTER) Community  of Practice (CoP). Barry I. Schneider is co-chair of  High End Computing (HEC) IWG. Chris Greer and Al  Wavering from NIST’s Engineering Laboratory co- chair NITRD’s Cyber Physical Systems (CPS) IWG and  the High Confdence Software and Systems (HCSS)  IWG, respectively.  Tim Polk is the principal NIST participant in the bi- weekly coordination activities of the federal Special  Cyber Operations Research and Engineering (SCORE)  Committee. SCORE enables technology transfer  through the sharing of NIST cybersecurity expertise  and publications with researchers throughout the  Federal Government. The SCORE committee interacts  with federal leaders and reports to the National  Science and Technology Council’s Committee on  Homeland and National Security.  All the NIST leaders for interagency coordination  leverage these working groups and committees to  communicate powerfully about NIST’s research,  frameworks, and publications and bring back insights  and activities relevant to NIST’s work.

Digital evidence can  be a part of investigating most crimes, since material  relevant to the crime may be recorded in digital form.  Methods for securely acquiring, storing and analyzing  digital evidence quickly and efciently are critical. ITL  promotes the efcient and efective use of computer  technology to investigate crimes. The project team  develops tools for testing computer forensic software,  including test criteria and test sets. ITL also maintains  the National Software Reference Library (NSRL) – a  36  https://www.nitrd.gov mailto:william.newhouse@nist.gov  NIST/ITL CYBERSECURITY PROGRAM ANNUAL REPORT 2017  vast archive of published software applications that is  an important resource for both criminal investigators  and historians.  National Software Reference Library  The NSRL is designed to collect software  from various sources and incorporate fle profles  computed from this software into a Reference Data  Set (RDS) of information. The RDS can be used by law  enforcement, government, and industry organizations  to review fles on a computer by matching fle profles  in the RDS. This will help alleviate much of the efort  involved in determining which fles are important as  evidence on computers or fle systems that have been  seized as part of criminal investigations. The NSRL  also provides a research environment to promote the  development of new forensics techniques and other  applications in computer science.  The RDS continues to be the premier software  resource and, in FY 2017, the NSRL published four  releases. There are currently 23,000 microcomputer  applications and 160,000 mobile device applications  yielding a combined total of 326 million fles. In FY  2017, the NSRL was expanded to include mobile  applications and to include the profles obtained from  installing and exercising applications.  Computer Forensics Tool Testing Project  There is a critical need in the law enforcement  community to ensure the reliability of computer  forensic tools. The goal of the Computer Forensic  Tool Testing (CFTT) project at NIST is to establish  a methodology for testing computer forensic  software tools by the development of general tool  specifcations, test procedures, test criteria, test sets,  and test hardware. The project is intended to provide  the information necessary for toolmakers to improve  tools, for users to make informed choices about  acquiring and using computer forensics tools, and  for interested parties to understand the capabilities  of the tools. The project team’s approach for testing  computer forensic tools is based on well-recognized  international methodologies for conformance testing  and quality testing that ensures that forensic software  tools consistently produce accurate and objective test  results.  In FY 2016, the CFTT project expanded to allow  forensics testers to use the NIST testing methodology  in their own labs and to produce standardized test  reports for disk imaging forensic tools. In FY 2017,  federated testing was further expanded with three  major updates: a revision to disk-imaging testing, the  addition of mobile device tool testing and hardware  write-blocker testing. In FY 2018, the project will be  expanded to support string searching and forensic  media preparation. The forensic community is  beginning to use federated testing to test tools and  share test reports. The CFTT project also maintains the  Forensics Tool Catalog and the Computer Forensics  Reference Data Sets (CFReDS). The Tool Catalog  website is a community-sourced catalog of forensic  tools aided by a taxonomy of forensic tools. The Tool  Catalog grew by 17 tools in FY 2017. The CFReDS data  sets are used in a variety of settings, such as university  classes, to try out forensics tools on known data.

NICE has been  focusing on eforts to achieve this by aligning to three  goals: 1) accelerate learning and skills development, 2)  nurture a diverse learning community, and 3) guide  career development and workforce planning.  In support of goal 1, in November 2016, CyberSeek  was launched to provide a visualization of the  demand for and supply of cybersecurity workers  across the nation (see http://cyberseek.org). At its  launch, the tool also provided a visualization of career  pathways in cybersecurity. The data from this tool, in  part, has helped NICE develop an executive overview  white paper on Cybersecurity Workforce Demand. In  FY 2017, NICE also supported goal one through the  development of a paper regarding Cybersecurity  Apprenticeships. This report and other white papers  developed by NICE authors are available at https://  www.nist.gov/itl/applied-cybersecurity/nice/  resources/one-pagers.  In support of goal 2, NICE hosted a Veterans in  Cybersecurity Workshop in March 2017. This workshop  convened approximately 40 representatives of federal  and state government, branches of the military,  industry, and workforce development organizations  to explore issues, discuss initiatives and better  understand the gaps that exist in helping our veterans  In support of goal 3, NICE published SP 800-181,  The NICE Framework, in August 2017 (see https://  nist.gov/nice/framework). The NICE Framework  establishes a taxonomy and common lexicon that  is to be used to describe all cybersecurity work and  workers, irrespective of where or for whom the work  is performed. Figure 11 shows the seven categories of  the NICE Framework. These categories further break  down into Specialty Areas, Work Roles, Tasks, and  Knowledge, Skills, and Abilities (KSAs).  Figure 12: Clarence Williams, Lead for Government  Engagement at NICE, and Rodney Petersen,  Director of NICE, speak with an attendee at the  CyberSecureGov Conference in Washington, D.C.  NICE continued its coordination with academic,  industry and government partners throughout the  year at various meetings, workshops and events. In  August 2017, NICE held a workshop in Chicago, Illinois.  This workshop, along with a Request for Information  that NICE issued, provided information to inform  work and to prepare a report to the President on the  fndings and recommendations about supporting the  growth and sustainment of the nation’s cybersecurity  workforce in the public and private sectors.  transition to careers in cybersecurity. 38  http://cyberseek.org https://www.nist.gov/itl/applied-cybersecurity/nice/resources/one-pagers https://www.nist.gov/itl/applied-cybersecurity/nice/resources/one-pagers https://www.nist.gov/itl/applied-cybersecurity/nice/resources/one-pagers https://nist.gov/nice/framework https://nist.gov/nice/framework  NIST/ITL CYBERSECURITY PROGRAM ANNUAL REPORT 2017  In FY 2018, NICE will continue to promote and  coordinate annual NICE activities such as the NICE  Quarterly eNewsletter; the NICE Webinar Series; the  NICE Conference to be held on November 7-8, 2017  in Dayton, Ohio; and the NICE K-12 Cybersecurity  Education Conference to be held December 4-5, 2017  in Nashville, Tennessee. NICE will also kick of the  frst annual National Cybersecurity Career Awareness  Week on November 13-18, 2017 to focus local,  regional, and national interest to inspire, educate, and  engage children through adults to pursue careers in  cybersecurity.

Consistently one of the most-visited  websites at NIST, CSRC is used by several ITL  divisions to communicate information about NIST’s  cybersecurity and privacy programs and projects,  research, validation testing, software tools, and other  areas of interest to NIST’s customers in government,  industry, academia and elsewhere, both within the  U.S. and globally.  The CSRC website serves as a primary NIST  repository of cybersecurity and privacy standards,  guidelines, and technical documents. Refer to the  Publications Released in FY 2017 section of this  annual report for details about the ITL Cybersecurity  Program’s publications released in FY 2017.  CSRC’s most signifcant event occurred in  September 2017, with the launch of a completely  redesigned, content management system-based  website. In addition to aligning with the main NIST  website’s look and feel, the new CSRC website is  organized around several primary content types to  make information easier to fnd and maintain: projects,  publications, news, events and presentations. A new  taxonomy of topics is used to tag content site-wide,  and an online, searchable glossary of information  security terminology expands on the terms identifed  in NISTIR 7298 Revision 2. One of the most noticeable  changes is a vastly improved publications section, in  terms of content, searchability, and browsing. At the  end of FY 2017, the site provided detailed information  about more than 1,200 of NIST’s current and historical  information security publications.  The CSRC Redesign Team designed the site’s  architecture and interface to signifcantly improve  site navigation, search, and the ability of ITL staf to  maintain and contribute content. The site also uses  responsive design to greatly improve CSRC’s usability  on mobile devices. More than 21,000 individual  content items were transferred from the legacy site,  and in February 2017, ITL successfully launched a  beta version of the new site. Feedback from beta- site users over seven months was incorporated by  the CSRC Redesign Team to fx bugs, implement  enhancements, and refne the site’s look and feel. The  team considered all comments it received, and made  every efort to implement those suggestions. After  making signifcant, gradual improvements to the beta  site, NIST launched the new CSRC on September 18,  2017, while simultaneously retiring the legacy site.  In FY 2018, the CSRC Redesign Team will continue  to enhance the content, functionality and usability of  the new site, striving to provide a better and more  useful experience to site users.  The CSRC team maintains an email subscription  list with more than 78,000 subscribers worldwide.  Subscribers receive notifcations when news updates,  event details, and publication information—including  the release of draft publications for public comment—  are posted to CSRC. To review the available lists  and subscribe, visit https://csrc.nist.gov/ and in the  page footer click either the envelope icon or the  “Subscribe to CSRC Updates” link. Additional NIST/ITL  Cybersecurity topics are available including: Federal  Information Security Management Act (FISMA) news;  Cybersecurity Framework; National Initiative for  Cybersecurity Education (NICE); ITL’s Trusted Identity  Group (TIG), and several lists for the NCCoE. 39  https://www.nist.gov/itl/applied-cybersecurity/nice mailto:rodney@nist.gov mailto:danielle.santos@nist.gov http:https://csrc.nist.gov  ITL CYBERSECURITY PROGRAM AND PROJECTS  |  FY 2017  FOR MORE INFORMATION, SEE:  https://csrc.nist.gov  CONTACTS:  Questions regarding the CSRC website can be sent  to the CSRC Webmasters at:  webmaster-csrc@nist.gov  Mr. Patrick O’Reilly  (301) 975-4751  patrick.oreilly@nist.gov  Ms. Nicole Keller  (301) 975-3648  nicole.keller@nist.gov  Federal Computer Security Managers’  (FCSM) Forum  The Federal Computer Security Managers’ Forum  (the Forum) is sponsored by NIST to promote the  sharing of security-related information among federal  agencies. The Forum, which serves more than 1,000  members, strives to provide an ongoing opportunity  for managers of federal information security  programs to exchange information security materials  in a timely manner, build upon the experiences of  other programs, and to reduce possible duplication  of eforts. It provides a mechanism for NIST to share  information directly with federal agency information  security managers in fulfllment of NIST’s leadership  mandate under FISMA. The Forum also assists NIST  in establishing and maintaining relationships with  other individuals and organizations that are actively  addressing information security issues within the  Federal Government. During FY 2017, CSD’s Victoria  Pillitteri and Jody Jacobs served as Co-Chairs, and  Peggy Himes from ACD served as the Secretariat of  the Forum, providing administrative and logistical  support. Additionally, during FY 2017, the FCSM  webpage was signifcantly restructured and updated  to ensure that presentation information, both current  and archived, is delivered as efciently and efectively  as possible.  The Forum maintains an extensive email  subscription service/listserv. Participation in the  service is restricted to those Federal and State  Government employees and their designated support  contractors with a role in the management of their  organization’s information system security program.  The email listserv ofers an open forum for information  sharing of best practices and recommendations, and  serves as a resource for this community of interest.  The Forum conducts quarterly meetings and an  annual two-day conference for a discussion of current  issues and topics of interest to those responsible for  supporting the information security programs of  federal agencies.  Discussion topics at the quarterly FCSM meetings  in FY 2017 included briefngs on:  • The National Cybersecurity Center of  Excellence (NCCoE) - Federally Funded  Research and Development Center (FFRDC),  • Developing an information security continuous  monitoring (ISCM) Assessment Methodology,  • Security Automation and Continuous  Monitoring,  • Demonstration of a Continuous Diagnostic  Monitoring Instance,  • Guidance for Assigning New Cybersecurity  Codes to Positions with IT/Cybersecurity/  Cyber-related Functions and the New  Cybercareers.gov Site,  • Using Risk Management to Improve Privacy in  Federal Systems,  • National Cybersecurity and Communications  Integration Center (NCCIC) 101, and  • Creating a Cybersecurity Scorecard for a  Federal Agency.  FY 2017’s annual two-day meeting was held at  NIST on June 20-21, 2017 with over 220 attendees.  Presentations included the current technical,  operational and management information systems  security topics and updates on the information  system security activities of OMB, General Services  Administration (GSA), Department of Homeland  Security (DHS), Department of Health and Human  Services (HHS), NARA, Internal Revenue Service (IRS),  National Weather Service (NOAA), Ofce of Personnel  Management (OPM), and NIST. A frst ever “ask the  experts” panel was held where attendees could ask  subject matter experts on security, privacy, and  procurement-related questions. Most presentations  from the two-day ofsite and monthly meetings are  available online (see https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/  Forum/Archived-Events-and-Presentations). 40  https://csrc.nist.gov mailto:webmaster-csrc@nist.gov mailto:patrick.oreilly@nist.gov mailto:nicole.keller@nist.gov https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/Forum/Archived-Events-and-Presentations https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/Forum/Archived-Events-and-Presentations http:Cybercareers.gov  NIST/ITL CYBERSECURITY PROGRAM ANNUAL REPORT 2017  The following is a list of presentations that were  given at the annual two-day meeting:  • Overview of SP 800-184, Guide for  Cybersecurity Event Recovery  • FedRAMP Tailored  • Overview of the Software Quality Assurance  Project and Software Assurance Marketplace  • Applying the Cybersecurity Framework in  Federal Agencies: Presentation and Panel  Discussion  • Top Down vs. Bottom Up Governance of Risk,  What’s Best?  • Cybersecurity Dashboard on a Shoestring  Budget  • High Vulnerability Asset Overlay  • Pushing Computers to the Edge: Next  Generation Security and Privacy Controls for  Systems and IoT Devices  • Infusing Cybersecurity into the Government  Acquisition Process  • Government Accountability Ofce Update  • “Ask the Experts” Panel  • NIST Interagency Report 8011, Automation  Support for Security Control Assessments  The Forum plays a valuable role in helping NIST  and other federal agencies develop and maintain  a strong, proactive stance in the identifcation and  resolution of new strategic and tactical IT security  issues as they emerge.

FISSEA strives  to elevate the general level of information system  security knowledge for the Federal Government  and the federal workforce. It also seeks to assist the  professional development of its members.  FISSEA membership is open to information system  security professionals, professional trainers and  educators, and managers responsible for information  system security training programs in federal agencies,  as well as contractors of these agencies and faculty  members of accredited educational institutions who  are involved in information security training and  education. Willingness to share products, information,  and experiences is all that is required to become a  FISSEA member. A working group meets monthly to  administer business activities.  FISSEA maintains a website and a mailing list, and  participates in a social networking site as a means of  communication for its members. CSD assists FISSEA  with its operations by providing staf support for  several of its activities and by being FISSEA’s host  agency.  The 30th Annual FISSEA Conference occurred on  June 19, 2017 at NIST. The FISSEA audience included  managers responsible for information systems  security awareness, training, certifcations, workforce  identifcation, compliance, etc. in federal agencies;  contractors providing awareness and training support;  and faculty members of accredited educational  institutions who are involved in information security  training and education. Clarence Williams, Peggy  Himes, Gretchen Morris (DB Consulting Group/NASA),  and other members of the FISSEA Working Group,  were integral to the efort to support the conference.  This year’s theme was “Securing the Future to  Infnity and Beyond: Improving Cybersecurity through  Awareness, Training, and Education”. Attendees  gained new techniques for developing/conducting  training, cost-efective practices, considerations for  41  https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/Forum mailto:victoria.pillitteri@nist.gov mailto:Jody.jacobs@nist.gov  ITL CYBERSECURITY PROGRAM AND PROJECTS  |  FY 2017  compliance, and free resources and contacts. Over  150 cybersecurity training professionals attended the  one-day conference.  NIST’s ITL Director, Charles Romine, welcomed  attendees to the event. FISSEA Lifetime Member,  Louis Numkin, provided a historical timeline of  FISSEA, recognizing 30 years of providing a platform  for security specialists to collaborate, network, and  learn.  Presenters represented NIST, DHS, DoD, HHS,  private industry, and academia. Attendees had an  opportunity to share about their specifc awareness  and training programs throughout the conference.  The FISSEA Educator of the Year Award was  established to recognize and honor a contemporary  who is making special eforts to create, build, manage,  or inspire an information systems security awareness,  training, or education program. Gretchen Morris, 2015  FISSEA Educator of the Year, presented the 2016  FISSEA Educator of the Year Award to Professor  Sushil Jajodia of George Mason University. Mrs. Morris  shared Mr. Jajodia’s contributions to the cybersecurity  education industry by characterizing his contributions  in three ways: as an educationist, a researcher, and a  thought leader. Professor Jajodia was presented with  a plaque as recognition of his achievements in the  security community.

The Board plays a  central and unique role in providing the government  with expert advice concerning information security  and privacy issues that may afect federal information  systems. Title III of the E-Government Act of 2002  reafrmed the need for this Board by giving it an  additional responsibility: to thoroughly review all  of the proposed information technology standards  and guidelines developed under Section 20 of the  National Institute of Standards and Technology Act  (15 U.S. Code (U.S.C.) 278g-3), as amended.  The ISPAB is a federal advisory committee with  specifc statutory objectives to identify emerging  managerial, technical, administrative, and physical  safeguard issues related to information security  and privacy. The Board was originally created by  the Computer Security Act of 1987 (P.L. 100-235)  as the Computer System Security and Privacy  Advisory Board (CSSPAB) within the Department of  Commerce. The CSSPAB was chartered in May 1988 in  accordance with the Federal Advisory Committee Act,  as amended. The 2002 FISMA legislation amended  the statutory authority of the Board and provided its  current name.  The duties of the Board, as stipulated in FISMA,  include:  • Identifcation of emerging managerial,  technical, administrative, and physical  safeguard issues relative to information  security and privacy;  • Advising NIST, DHS and the Director of the  OMB on information security and privacy  issues pertaining to Federal Government  information systems (including the thorough  review of proposed standards and guidelines  developed under 15 U.S.C. 278g-3 - Computer  Standards Program); and  • Annually reporting its fndings to the  Secretary of Commerce, the Director of the  OMB, the Director of NSA, and the appropriate  committees of Congress.  Congress indicated the long-term need for the  Board by setting the term of Board members to four  years. The charter requires that the NIST Director  appoint the Chairperson and all 12 members of the  Board. They are selected for their preeminence in the  information technology industry or related disciplines.  The charter stipulates that Board members  be selected from three main categories, with each  category providing four members. Category 1 includes  members from outside the Federal Government who  are eminent in the information technology industry,  at least one of whom is a representative of small  or medium-sized companies in such industries.  Category 2 also includes members from outside the  Federal Government who are eminent in the feld  of information technology or related disciplines,  but who are not employed by or representative of a  producer of information. Category 3 includes those  from the Federal Government who are experienced  43  https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/Federal-Info-Systems-Security-Educators-Assoc https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/Federal-Info-Systems-Security-Educators-Assoc https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/Federal-Info-Systems-Security-Educators-Assoc https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/Federal-Info-Systems-Security-Educators-Assoc mailto:clarence.williams@nist.gov mailto:raechell.finch@nist.gov  ITL CYBERSECURITY PROGRAM AND PROJECTS  |  FY 2017  in information system management, including those  with experience in information security and privacy,  at least one of whom should be from the National  Security Agency. The diversity of these categories  helps the Board to meet its statutory objectives.  Federal members bring a detailed understanding  of the federal processing environment; industry  brings concerns and experiences regarding product  development and market formation, while private  computer security experts are able to bring their  experiences of commercial cost-efective security  measures into Board discussions.  Chris Boyer is currently the Chair of ISPAB. Mr.  Boyer, the Assistant Vice President for Global Public  Policy at AT&T, joined the Board in 2012 and assumed  the responsibilities of the Chair in January 2016 (see  list of Board members https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/  ISPAB/Members).  During FY 2017, ISPAB held three meetings, all in  Washington, D.C.:  • June 28-30, 2017;  • March 29-31, 2017; and  • October 26-28, 2016.  In keeping with previous practices at the frst  meeting of each fscal year, the Board established a  work plan for FY 2017. The resulting plan included the  following areas of focus:  • Cryptography, and specifcally NIST R&D;  • Metrics – success measures for security and  privacy;  • Trust in NIST (accountability and success);  • Quantum-resistant encryption;  • Identity management;  • Privacy engineering;  • FISMA – Continuous Diagnostics and  Mitigation (CDM) and Federal Risk and  Authorization Management Program  (FedRAMP);  • High-Value Asset cybersecurity;  • Cybersecurity; and  • Updates of other critical NIST publications.  In aligning with the work-plan focus areas, the  Board expanded its work to include the following:  • Acquisition, Supply Chain Security, and Open  Source trustworthy software;  • Mobile Devices and the Protection of Sensitive  Information;  • Machine Learning and Artifcial Intelligence;  • The NIST Cybersecurity Framework;  • The Federal Information Security Management  Act (FISMA);  • Emerging Technologies; and  • The National Cybersecurity Center of  Excellence (NCCoE).  The presenters at each Board meeting were  leaders and experts representing private industry,  academia, federal agency Chief Information Ofcers  (CIOs), Inspector Generals (IGs) and Chief Information  Security Ofcers (CISOs).  Copies of the current list of members and their  biographies, the Board’s charter and past Board  activities are located at https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/  ISPAB.

SMBs cannot  always justify an extensive security program or even  full-time staf devoted to information security. Faced  with limited resources and budgets, SMBs need  practical solutions and training that enable them to  cost-efectively address their cybersecurity risks. NIST  has partnered with other federal agencies and public- private organizations to help address these needs.  During FY 2017, the Small Business Outreach  Program accomplished the following:  • Partnered with other federal agencies to  catalog and evaluate existing cybersecurity  educational materials designed for SMB use;  • Collaborated with federal partners, led by the  Small Business Administration (SBA) and the  Department of Homeland Security (DHS),  on the development of the Small Business  Development Center Cyber Strategy;  • Reviewed available SMB training programs  from federal partners and the National Cyber  Security Alliance (NCSA);  • Evaluated existing NIST SMB-focused  educational materials such as reports,  presentations, and online content;  • Updated the Small Business Corner website  to refect program updates and simplify SMB  contact with NIST;  • Initiated the development of the NIST  strategic plan for small business outreach,  refecting requirements in new Congressional  legislation; and  • Published Revision 1 of NISTIR 7621,  Small Business Information Security: The  Fundamentals.

NIST has standardized two families of Secure  Hash Algorithms (SHA): SHA-1 and SHA-2 in Federal  Information Processing Standard (FIPS) 180, and  SHA-3 in FIPS 202.  The SHA-1 function—which was published in the  original version of FIPS 180 in 1995, and which is still  specifed along with the SHA-2 family in FIPS 180-4—  has been deprecated for many years, because it could  no longer be relied upon to provide the important  property of “collision resistance.” In fact, in 2017 a  SHA-1 collision (diferent inputs with the same output)  was published by researchers at Centrum Wiskunde  & Informatica (CWI) Institute of Amsterdam and  Google, based on the seminal cryptanalysis in 2005  In FY 2018, the Small Business Outreach Program  will continue to collaborate with federal and other  partners to understand the cybersecurity needs of  SMBs and identify and/or develop materials and  training to meet those needs.  by Xiaoyun Wang of Shandong University.  Wang’s research was the main impetus to the  development of SHA-3 through a public competition,  which NIST initiated in 2007. The winning algorithm,  KECCAK, was chosen in part because its components  45  https://www.nist.gov/programs-projects/small-business-corner-sbc https://www.nist.gov/programs-projects/small-business-corner-sbc mailto:smallbizsecurity@nist.gov mailto:nelson.hastings@nist.gov mailto:marian.merritt@nist.gov mailto:jeffrey.marron@nist.gov mailto:matthew.barrett@nist.gov https://www.nist.gov/publications/small  ITL CYBERSECURITY PROGRAM AND PROJECTS  |  FY 2017  could easily be adapted to provide a variety of  functionalities.  FIPS 202 realized some of this potential by  including two eXtendable Output Functions (XOFs),  which allow variable-length outputs, in addition to its  four hash functions. The two XOFs are called SHAKE128  and SHAKE256; the numerical sufx indicates the  supported security strength. FIPS 202 also supports  a fexible scheme for “domain separation” between  diferent functions, which ensures that diferent  named functions will produce unrelated outputs.  In December 2016, NIST further expanded the  uses of KECCAK with the publication SP 800-185, SHA- 3 Derived Functions: cSHAKE, KMAC, TupleHash and  ParallelHash. It provides four new types of functions,  as indicated in the title, each with the same two  supported security strengths:  • cSHAKE128 and cSHAKE256 are XOFs that  can be “customized” for individual users or  applications, so that their outputs would be  unrelated to any other SHAKE variants;  • KMAC128 and KMAC256 are keyed-hash  functions with variable-length outputs, i.e.,  pseudorandom functions (PRFs);  • TupleHash128 and TupleHash256 are hash  functions on tuples of input strings; and  • ParallelHash128 and ParallelHash256 are hash  functions that can exploit parallel processing  to efciently hash long messages.  NIST is currently considering the development  of a parallelizable hashing mode and XOF mode for  generic hash functions (e.g., SHA-2). These modes  would allow the SHA-2 family to achieve some of the  functionality of the SHA-3 family.

This publication includes a specifcation of  the Data Encryption Algorithm (DEA) engine that was  originally specifed in FIPS 46, The Data Encryption  Standard, in 1977 and was withdrawn as an approved  algorithm in 2005.  A security analysis and practical demonstration  of attacks on TDEA in several real-world protocols  was posted in FY 2017 by Karthikeyan Bhargavan  and Gaëtan Leurent of Inria (Paris) and is available at  https://sweet32.info/. This article provides evidence  that the collision attack on TDEA represents a serious  security vulnerability for many common uses of  these protocols — including the Hyper Text Transfer  Protocol Secure (HTTPS) protocol for secure Internet  connections. Moreover, the analysis shows that the  security vulnerability remains serious unless more  stringent limits are imposed on the amount of data  that can be encrypted under a single three-key bundle  than the current data limit recommended by NIST in  SP 800-67, Revision 1.  In response to this article, NIST posted a notice  announcing plans to reduce the maximum amount  of plaintext allowed to be encrypted under a single  TDEA three-key bundle from 232 to 220 (64-bit) blocks,  and to revise SP 800-67 accordingly. In addition, NIST  plans to disallow TDEA for TLS, IPsec and possibly  other protocols (see https://csrc.nist.gov/News/2017/  Update-to-Current-Use-and-Deprecation-of-TDEA  for the announcement).  In late FY 2017, a revision of SP 800-67 was  provided for public comment that included the above  restriction on the usage of TDEA for each three-key  TDEA key bundle. SP 800-67 Rev 2 will be published  in early FY 2018.

For example,  random bits are used to generate the keys needed  for encryption and digital signature applications.  CSD began work on the specifcation of random  bit generators in the late 1990s. Information on the  Random Bit Generation project is available at https://  csrc.nist.gov/projects/random-bit-generation.  This project consists of the development of  three NIST Special Publications (SPs). SP 800-90A,  Recommendation for Random Number Generation  Using Deterministic Random Bit Generators, was  initially published in 2007 and last revised in 2015. It  specifes several deterministic algorithms that can  be used for the generation of pseudorandom bits –  a sequence of bits produced by an algorithm, rather  than a random physical phenomenon that produces a  truly random sequence. Two additional documents (SP  800-90B and SP 800-90C) are under development,  and the latest drafts were made available for public  comment in 2016 via the Special Publications page:  https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/PubsSPs.html.  SP 800-90B, Recommendation for the  Entropy Sources Used for Random Bit Generation,  addresses the development and testing of entropy  sources. Figure 13 illustrates the model that the  Recommendation uses to describe an entropy source  and its components: a noise source, health tests, and  an optional conditioning component.  In Figure 13, the noise source contains the entropy- providing activity (e.g., the output of ring oscillators);  if the activity being sampled does not produce binary  data, then the noise source includes a digitization  process. Health tests are intended to detect whether  the noise source and the entropy source (as a whole)  continues to operate as expected. The optional  conditioning component is responsible for reducing  bias and/or increasing the entropy rate of the bits to  eventually be output by the entropy source.  SP 800-90B includes descriptions of the tests for  NIST’s Cryptographic Algorithm Validation Program  (CAVP) and Cryptographic Module Validation Program  (CMVP) to validate candidate entropy sources. During  FY 2017, CSD fnalized the test descriptions for the  initial publication of SP 800-90B, which is expected  to be published in early FY 2018. CSD will begin a  revision of the document in FY 2018 to address issues  that were not included in the initial version of the  document and any lessons learned during validation  testing by the CAVP and CMVP labs.  The initial version of SP 800-90B will be available  via the Special Publications page: https://csrc.nist.  gov/publications/PubsSPs.html.  In May 2017, a presentation “A Tale of Two Entropy  Source Validation Approaches: NIST 800 90B vs.  BSI AIS 31” was provided by Meltem Sönmez Turan  at the ICMC17 International Cryptographic Module  Conference held in Washington D.C.  SP 800-90C, Recommendation for Random  Bit Generator (RBG) Constructions, provides  basic guidance on the construction of Random  Bit Generators (RBGs) from the entropy sources  validated against the requirements of SP 800-90B  and the Deterministic Random Bit Generators (DRBG)  algorithms of SP 800-90A. SP 800-90C includes  constructions for both non-deterministic random  bit generators (NRBGs; also known as true random  number generators) and deterministic random bit  generators (DRBGs; also known as pseudorandom  number generators). Two general models are provided  in SP 800-90C, as shown in Figure 14 and Figure 15.

In this construction, each  bit output by the entropy source (as discussed in SP  800-90B) is exclusive-ORed with a bit of output from  a DRBG algorithm specifed in SP 800-90A.  Figure 15: DRBG and Oversampling NRBG  Figure 15 depicts the construction used for  the DRBGs and the second NRBG design – the  Oversampling NRBG. In this construction. the entropy  source repeatedly provides input to the DRBG  algorithm to produce the requested output.  The diference between DRBGs and NRBGs is the  availability of the entropy source and the frequency  of requesting output from the entropy source. For a  DRBG, an entropy source is only required for seeding  the DRBG; after the initial seeding process, further  requests for entropy-source output depend on the  implementation and application. For the Oversampling  NRBG, the entropy source must always be available  and is accessed whenever bits are requested from the  NRBG by a consuming application.  The latest draft of SP 800-90C is available via  the Special Publications page: https://csrc.nist.gov/  publications/PubsSPs.html.  Plans for FY 2018:  The RBG development team has the following  goals for FY 2018:  • Publish the initial version of SP 800-90B  and post the comments received during the  last public comment period, along with their  resolutions. The testing of entropy sources  by the CAVP and CMVP will begin as soon as  possible after publication.  • Monitor the testing of SP 800-90B in the  CAVP and CMVP labs to determine problems  that need to be addressed in the next  version of SP 800-90B. In some cases, the  problems may be addressed by additions  to the FIPS 140-2 Implementation Guidance  document until SP 800-90B is revised. The  Implementation Guidance document is  available at https://csrc.nist.gov/groups/STM/  cmvp/documents/fps140-2/FIPS1402IG.pdf.  • Begin a revision of SP 800-90B to address  issues not included in the initial version of SP  800-90B, as well as any issues that surface  during CAVP and CMVP entropy source  validation.  • Finalize and publish 800-90C, posting the  comments received and their resolution, along  with the document.  • Complete plans for testing SP 800-90C.

It uses two independent, commercially  available sources of randomness, each with an  independent hardware entropy source and SP  800-90A-approved components.  The NIST Beacon is designed to provide  unpredictability, autonomy, and consistency.  48  https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/PubsSPs.html https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/PubsSPs.html https://csrc.nist.gov/groups/STM/cmvp/documents/fips140-2/FIPS1402IG.pdf https://csrc.nist.gov/groups/STM/cmvp/documents/fips140-2/FIPS1402IG.pdf https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/random-bit-generation mailto:elaine.barker@nist.gov mailto:john.kelsey@nist.gov mailto:meltem.turan@nist.gov https://beacon.nist.gov/home https://beacon.nist.gov/home mailto:kerry.mckay@nist.gov  NIST/ITL CYBERSECURITY PROGRAM ANNUAL REPORT 2017  Unpredictability means that users cannot  algorithmically predict bits before they are made  available by the source. Autonomy means that the  source is resistant to attempts by outside parties to  alter the distribution of the random bits. Consistency  means that a set of users can access the source in  such a way that they are confdent of receiving the  same random string.  The NIST Beacon posts bit-strings in blocks of  512 bits every 60 seconds. Each such value is time- stamped and signed to form a packet that also includes  the hash of the previous value to chain the sequence  of values together. This prevents all parties, even the  source, from retroactively changing an output packet  without being detected. The NIST Beacon keeps all  output packets. At any point in time, the full history of  outputs is available to users.  Tables of random numbers have probably  been used for multiple purposes at least since the  Industrial Revolution. In the digital age, algorithmic  pseudorandom number generators (PRNGs) have  largely replaced these tables. The NIST Beacon  expands the use of randomness to multiple scenarios  in which neither tables nor PRNGs can be used. The  extra functionalities stem mainly from three features.  First, the Beacon-generated numbers cannot be  predicted before they are published. Second, the  public, time-bound, and authenticated nature of the  Beacon allows a user application to prove to anybody  that it used truly random numbers not known before a  certain point in time. Third, this proof can be presented  ofine and at any point in the future.  Although commercially available physical sources  of randomness are adequate as entropy sources for  currently envisioned implementations of the NIST  Beacon, the NIST Randomness Beacon project team is  working on developing a source of verifably random  sequences. In collaboration with NIST physicists  from the Physical Measurement Laboratory (PML),  the project team aims to use quantum non-locality  to build an entropy source whose unpredictability  is guaranteed by the laws of physics. In FY 2016,  a major milestone was achieved, namely, a strong  loophole-free test of local realism (where individual  particles are governed by elements of reality, even  if these elements are hidden) (see https://www.nist.  gov/news-events/news/2015/11/nist-team-proves- spooky-action-distance-really-real).  The project team has also made progress in  helping other institutions set up interoperable sources.  This is important because multiple sources can be  combined in such a way that all sources would have  to be compromised in order to degrade the common  random strings. It is expected that the University  of Chile will start operating their own randomness  beacon during FY 2018.  As of the end of FY 2017, the NIST Beacon has  been functioning without major interruptions for more  than four years. During this time, the project team has  received valuable input from a growing community  of users. As a result, the project team has redesigned  the Application Programming Interface (API) and the  architecture. The changes provide higher security and  availability, as well as better interoperability. Version  2.0 of the NIST Beacon is scheduled to be deployed  during November 2017.  NIST encourages the community of users to  research and publish novel ways in which this tool can  be used.

The ability to generate strong cryptographic keys  is directly related to having access to unpredictable  random data, but generating truly unpredictable  random data on common computing devices is hard  and unreliable. As a result, weak keys are widely used  in cryptographic applications, thus compromising the  security of the sensitive data protected by them - potentially with disastrous consequences.  A primary goal of this project is to provide  high quality, truly unpredictable random data to  devices on the Internet to enable them to generate  strong cryptographic keys and attest the strength  of the keys used to protect data in transit or at rest,  49  https://www.nist.gov/news-events/news/2015/11/nist-team-proves-spooky-action-distance-really-real https://www.nist.gov/news-events/news/2015/11/nist-team-proves-spooky-action-distance-really-real https://www.nist.gov/news-events/news/2015/11/nist-team-proves-spooky-action-distance-really-real https://www.nist.gov/programs-projects/nist-randomness-beacon https://www.nist.gov/programs-projects/nist-randomness-beacon mailto:rene.peralta@nist.gov  ITL CYBERSECURITY PROGRAM AND PROJECTS  |  FY 2017  thereby enabling cryptographic system strength  attestation. Achieving this goal would provide a  solid basis for achieving the goals of the Automated  Cryptographic Validation Testing project (see https://  csrc.nist.gov/projects/acvt) as well as addressing the  problems targeted by the Cryptographic Programs  and Laboratory Accreditation (see the next section:  Validated Programs), where entropy estimation  has persisted as one of the most difcult and labor- consuming activities, causing problems for all parties  involved: the industry, the testing laboratories and the  government validators.  Random data obtained from sources of true  randomness that are based on unpredictable physical  phenomena, such as quantum efects, is much  better suited for cryptographic applications. CSD is  collaborating with the NIST Physical Measurement  Laboratory (PML) to build a quantum source. The  aim is to use quantum efects to generate sequences  that are guaranteed to be unpredictable, even  if an attacker has access to the random source.  (For more information on this collaboration, see  https://www.nist.gov/pml/div684/random_  numbers_bell_test.cfm).  This EaaS project aims to develop a system and  protocols for obtaining random data with high entropy  from one or more remote sources. The high-level  architecture is shown in Figure 16. The architecture  of the Entropy-as-a-Service system consists of two  main parts: the client-side and the server-side. The  critical components of the system are the quantum  device, the EaaS server and a secure device in the  client systems that is capable of providing strong  isolation and protection for the cryptographic keys  stored inside the device and ofering a set of basic  cryptographic services.  The EaaS server is continuously fed random data  from the attached quantum source. The data enters  a frst in, frst out (FIFO)-like bufer in the server’s  Random Access Memory (RAM), and, when a client  request arrives, the server reads the top value from  the bufer, signs and encrypts it, and then sends it  to the requester. The FIFO bufer shifts after every  request and when new data comes from the random  source. The EaaS server ensures that the FIFO bufer  is erased prior to server shutdown and never copied  to disk. Open implementations can help ensure that  this occurs.  The client system consists of a classic computing  device enabled with a dedicated hardware  component capable of storing secret cryptographic  keys and seeds. A dedicated software application  bridges the communication between EaaS and the  hardware component. Examples of secure hardware  components are the Trusted Platform Module  (TPM), TrustZone technology in Advanced Reduced  Instruction Set Computing (RISC) Machine (ARM)  processors, and Identity Protection Technology in  Intel processors. Recently, an alternative innovative  technology has emerged that allows extracting  unique cryptographic keys from the imperfections of  memory Static Random Access Memory (SRAM) cells  used in common computers. The idea behind this  technology is to extract PUF-like unique data from the  SRAM chip, which is then used to construct a unique  key. This technology is quite interesting for EaaS  applications on the client side because it eliminates  the need to provision an initial key for accessing  EaaS. If a client system or device does not have a  secure hardware component, it can still use EaaS. The  presence of a hardware component simply provides  further guarantees to the system or device user, when  present.  EaaS uses the Hyper Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP)  to transfer entropy payloads from the server to clients.  To secure this transmission, the server encrypts the  data using the client’s public key and digitally signs  the payload with the server’s own private key.  Client devices mix this data with locally available  random data to seed random number generators to  generate strong cryptographic keys and other random  values independently from the remote sources.  50  https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/acvt https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/acvt https://www.nist.gov/pml/div684/random_numbers_bell_test.cfm https://www.nist.gov/pml/div684/random_numbers_bell_test.cfm  NIST/ITL CYBERSECURITY PROGRAM ANNUAL REPORT 2017  network  capability,  i.e . device Q.!1 the  loT  it:ed �  HHh[EaiiS:a., ... ,  EaaS,111 local];  Key ;;;  ORBG(,eed)  /  /r - ,,.

A published paper  on EaaS in IEEE Computer magazine generated a lot  of interest among the public, including companies  from the U.S. and Canada who approached the team  and asked for assistance in implementing and hosting  their own EaaS servers. The team started a technology  transfer efort to help with this. The team also continues  the collaboration with a team of researchers at the  University of Florida who work under a NIST research  grant to explore ways to leverage EaaS in protecting  against integrated circuit counterfeiting and thereby  help secure a supply chain. The University of Florida  researchers working on this grant obtained interesting  security results that identifed security vulnerabilities  in widely used protocols for intellectual property  protection in integrated circuit manufacturing and  resulted in proposals for new secure protocols that  eliminated these vulnerabilities.  The team continues to develop the system to  provide a publicly accessible NIST EaaS instance  in FY 2018. The team succeeded in establishing a  non-disclosure agreement and a collaboration with  Intrinsic ID, Inc. – a company with complementing  technology for constructing the initial key on the  client side by extracting it from SRAM memory cells.  The team also established a collaborative relationship  with Crypto4A and 2Keys Corp. from Canada on  51  ITL CYBERSECURITY PROGRAM AND PROJECTS  |  FY 2017  developing a common protocol for EaaS. The team  coordinated with the research team working on the  NIST Beacon for developing common back-end  components for the two services.

A block cipher transforms some fxed- length binary data (i.e., a “block” of data) into  seemingly random data of the same length. The  transformation is determined by the choice of some  secret data called the “key.” The same key is used to  reverse the transformation and recover the original  block of data. A cryptographic technique (e.g., for  encryption and/or authentication) that is constructed  from a block cipher is called a “mode of operation.”  Several modes of operation have been specifed  in the SP 800-38 series of publications. The latest  installment in the series, Special Publication 800- 38G, Recommendation for Block Cipher Modes of  Operation: Methods for Format-Preserving Encryption,  was published in 2016. It specifes two AES modes of  operation, called FF1 and FF3, for “format-preserving  encryption” (FPE), based on proposals that were  submitted from the private sector, specifcally, the  payments industry.  Recently, two academic researchers, Vaudenay  and Dürak, developed a cryptanalytic attack on  the FF3 mode. On April 12, 2017, CSD posted an  announcement that summarizes the attack and  outlines CSD’s plans to revise FF3 in a new draft of  SP 800-38G in FY 2018; see https://csrc.nist.gov/  News/2017/Recent-Cryptanalysis-of-FF3.  In FY 2018, CSD also plans to revisit SP 800-38D,  which specifes the Galois/Counter Mode (GCM) for  authenticated encryption. In particular, the security  of GCM depends critically on the requirement for the  uniqueness of the “nonce” input; CSD plans to seek  public comment on how to best update the guidance  for achieving this property.

The CSD began  providing guidance in managing the keys used for  cryptographic applications in the late 1990s to early  2000s. Information on the CSD’s key management  project is available at https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/  key-management.  SP 800-56A, Recommendation for Pair- Wise Key Establishment Schemes Using Discrete  Logarithm Cryptography:  In FY 2017, SP 800-56A was revised. SP 800- 56A was originally published in 2006, and was  previously revised in 2007 and 2013. This document  specifes Dife-Hellman (DH) and Menezes-Qu- Vanstone (MQV) key-agreement schemes, both  elliptic curve and fnite feld versions. Key agreement  results in keying material that is shared between the  participants. A key-agreement scheme is a procedure  in which both parties contribute information that  is used in generating a cryptographic key. A key- agreement scheme is defned by a cryptographic  algorithm, together with other information that must  be available by both parties when establishing keys.  The schemes are intended for use in communication  protocols (e.g., Transport Layer Security (TLS), one  of the protocols used by the Internet). The key- establishment schemes in SP 800-56A use public  key algorithms, and each participant in a key- agreement transaction uses a pair of keys—a public  key and a private key. The key-agreement process  includes the generation of a shared secret (which is 52  https://csrc.nist.gov/News/2017/Recent-Cryptanalysis-of-FF3 https://csrc.nist.gov/News/2017/Recent-Cryptanalysis-of-FF3 https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/block-cipher-techniques https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/block-cipher-techniques mailto:morris.dworkin@nist.gov https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/key-management https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/key-management mailto:apostol.vassilev@nist.gov  NIST/ITL CYBERSECURITY PROGRAM ANNUAL REPORT 2017  Party A (Com mu nications) Pa rty B  Genera t e ·- Generate  Key Pair 1:~ Exch ange Publ ic Keys Key Pair -· ~- l l ' ,  Compute Shared Secret Compute Shared Secret  ! !

Several key-agreement schemes are specifed  in SP 800-56A. Figure 17 below provides a simplifed  example of one of the key-agreement schemes. In this  example, each party:  1. Generates a key pair (either prior to or  during the key-agreement transaction);  2. Obtains the public key of the other party;  3.

SP 800-56C: Recommendation for Key- Derivation Methods in Key-Establishment  Schemes:  SP 800-56C specifes techniques for the derivation  of keys from a shared secret generated during a key- establishment scheme defned in SP 800-56A and SP  800-56B. SP 800-56A is discussed above. SP 800- 56B: Recommendation for Pairwise Key-Establishment  Schemes Using Integer Factorization Cryptography, is  available via https://csrc.nist.gov/publications.  SP 800-56C had included only one method  for key derivation - a two-step key-derivation  procedure that used either the  Keyed-Hash Message  Authentication Code (HMAC) or the Cipher-based  Message Authentication Code (CMAC) algorithm  during the process. HMAC is specifed in FIPS 198- 1: The Keyed-Hash Message Authentication Code  (HMAC), and CMAC is specifed for AES in SP 800- 38B: Recommendation for Block Cipher Modes of  Operation: the CMAC Mode of Authentication.

New Key Management Publications Under  Development:  A new document was started in FY 2016 on key  storage and recovery by an organization (e.g., key  backup and archiving). This document is intended  to serve as a guideline for the storage and recovery  of cryptographic keys that are not under the direct  control of the entity using those keys (e.g., the owner).  This includes the backup and archiving of copies of  the keys and the metadata associated with them. The  document will also discuss the recovery of those keys  when required (e.g., by the key’s owner or the owner’s  organization).  Plans for FY 2018:  During FY 2018, the CSD is expecting to accomplish  the following key management tasks:  • Publish the revisions of SP 800-56A and SP  800-56C.  • Begin the revision of SP 800-56B and post it  for public comment.  • Begin revisions of SP 800-131A, Transitions:  Recommendation for Transitioning the Use of  Cryptographic Algorithms and Key Lengths,  to address the use of Triple Data Encryption  Algorithm (TDEA), SP 800-56A, SP 800-56B,  KMAC and other SHA-3 derived functions  specifed in SP 800-185. A statement about  the advent of quantum-resistant algorithms  will also be included.  • Begin revisions of SP 800-57, Part 2,  Recommendation for Key Management,  Part 2: Best Practices for Key Management  Organization, to update the guidance.  • Revise SP 800-57, Part 3, Recommendation for  Key Management, Part 3: Application-Specifc  Key Management Guidance, to provide revised 54  https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800-56a/rev-3/draft https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800-56a/rev-3/draft https://csrc.nist.gov/publications https://csrc.nist.gov/publications https://csrc.nist.gov/publications https://csrc.nist.gov/publications https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800-56c/rev-1/draft https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800-56c/rev-1/draft https://csrc.nist.gov/publications  NIST/ITL CYBERSECURITY PROGRAM ANNUAL REPORT 2017  guidance on the use of the Internet Protocol  Security (IPsec) protocol.  • Continue the development of the  organizational key-storage and recovery  publication.  • Resume work on SP 800-71, Recommendation  for Key Establishment Using Symmetric Block  Ciphers.

TLS is a widely used cryptographic protocol that  provides communication security for a variety of  network applications, such as email, e-commerce, and  healthcare.  SP 800-52 was frst published in June of 2005,  and SP 800-52 Revision 1 was published in 2014.  Since the frst revision, CSD has been following  developments in TLS implementations, including  updates and attacks. In FY 2016, a second revision  was initiated that updates TLS recommendations to  include mitigations for recent attacks, synchronizes  cryptographic algorithm recommendations with  other NIST Special Publications, and provides more  fexibility to system administrators in choosing which  TLS features they should support. There is also  guidance for implementations of TLS version 1.3, a  signifcant update to TLS. SP 800-52 Revision 2 will  be posted for public review and comment in FY 2018.  CSD has been contributing to the development  of testssl.sh (see https://github.com/drwetter/testssl.  sh), an open-source program that tests TLS-enabled  servers, providing information about the protocols  and cipher suites supported, in addition to checking  for some well-known faws. In FY 2018, CSD will be  contributing code to testssl.sh that adds support for  TLS version 1.3. When the draft of SP 800-52 Revision  2 is posted for public comment, CSD intends to make a  draft version of this code available that includes some  checks for conformance to SP 800-52 Revision 2.

It is frequently used  to establish Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), requiring  both parties to share keying material, which can be  established using the Internet Key Exchange (IKE)  protocol, and enabling telecommuters or travelers to  gain secure access to their enterprise networks. IPsec  provides the cryptographic security functions for both  versions of the Internet Protocol, IPv4 and IPv6.  CSD has provided cryptographic guidance for  using IPsec and IKE in SP 800-57 part 3, Section 3:  Internet Protocol Security (IPsec). From the beginning  of FY 2017, CSD has been working on a revision of  the section and plans to publish it as a standalone  Special Publication. This SP will update and expand  the existing cryptographic guidelines. The important  technical updates include disallowing Triple DES and  recommending AES-GCM authenticated encryption  instead of the CipherBlock Chaining (CBC) mode.  CSD expects to release the draft SP in FY 2018 for  public comments. The SP will be harmonized with an  upcoming revision of SP 800-77, Guide to IPsec VPNs.  55  https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/key-management/cryptographic-key-management-systems https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/key-management/cryptographic-key-management-systems mailto:elaine.barker@nist.gov mailto:quynh.dang@nist.gov mailto:lily.chen@nist.gov mailto:allen.roginsky@nist.gov https://github.com/drwetter/testssl.sh https://github.com/drwetter/testssl.sh mailto:kerry.mckay@nist.gov mailto:david.cooper@nist.gov http:testssl.sh http:testssl.sh  ITL CYBERSECURITY PROGRAM AND PROJECTS  |  FY 2017  CONTACTS:  Ms. Elaine Barker Mr. Quynh Dang  (301) 975-2911 (301) 975-3610  elaine.barker@nist.gov quynh.dang@nist.gov  Elliptic Curve Cryptography  Elliptic curve cryptography is critical to the  adoption of strong cryptography during the  migration to higher security strengths. One of the  main advantages of elliptic curve cryptography is that  users can achieve the same level of security as other  systems, but with a much shorter key length. NIST has  standardized elliptic curve cryptography for digital  signature algorithms in FIPS 186: Digital Signature  Standard (DSS), and for key establishment schemes  in SP 800-56A: Recommendation for Pair-Wise Key  Establishment Schemes Using Discrete Logarithm  Cryptography.  In FIPS 186-4, NIST recommends 15 elliptic  curves of varying security strengths for use in these  elliptic curve cryptographic standards. However, the  provenance of the curves is not fully specifed in the  standard, leading to recent public concerns that there  could be a hidden weakness in these curves. NIST is  not aware of any vulnerability in these curves when  they are implemented correctly and used as described  in NIST standards and guidelines.  More than 15 years have now passed since these  curves were developed, and the community now  knows more about the security of elliptic curve  cryptography and practical implementation issues.  Advances within the cryptographic community have  led to the development of new elliptic curves and  algorithms whose designers claim to ofer better  performance and are easier to implement in a secure  manner. Some of these curves are under consideration  in voluntary, consensus-based Standards Developing  Organizations.  In FY 2017, NIST utilized feedback received to revise  and improve FIPS 186-4. In particular, NIST plans to  add new elliptic curves to the current recommended  set. The entire collection of recommended curves and  their specifcation will be moved to a new publication  SP 800-186: Recommendations for Discrete- Logarithm Based Cryptography: Elliptic Curve Domain  Parameters. In addition, new deterministic digital  signature schemes will be included in FIPS 186. It is  expected that the revised draft version of FIPS 186-5  (and SP 800-186) will be available for public comment  in early FY 2018.

If large-scale quantum  computers are ever built, they will be able to break  the existing infrastructure of public-key cryptography  (see Table 1). The focus of the Post-Quantum  Cryptography (PQC) project is to identify candidate  quantum-resistant systems that are secure against  both quantum and classical computers—as well as the  impact that such post-quantum algorithms will have  on current protocols and security infrastructures.  NIST researchers have held regular seminars  throughout FY 2017. The presentation topics included  the latest published results and security analyses, as  well as status reports on quantum computation, hash- based signatures, coding-based cryptography, lattice- based cryptography, and multivariate cryptography.  Through these presentations and discussions, the  project team has made signifcant progress in  understanding the strengths and weaknesses of the  existing cryptographic schemes in each category.  The NIST team also continues to be productive  in post-quantum cryptography research. The results  have been published at major conferences, such as  Real World Cryptography, Number Theory Methods in  Cryptography, Selected Areas in Cryptography, Post- Quantum Cryptography (PQCrypto), and AsiaCrypt.

NIST has also sponsored other research,  education, and research events.  In 2016, NIST published NISTIR 8105: Report  on Post-Quantum Cryptography, which shared the  team’s current understanding about the status of  quantum computing and post-quantum cryptography.  Shortly thereafter, NIST began the Post-Quantum  Standardization Process, a thorough multi-year  efort with the objective of creating new quantum- resistant cryptographic standards for public-key  encryption and digital signatures (see https://www.  nist.gov/pqcrypto). These functionalities are much  more complex than AES or SHA-3, and will require  fundamentally new techniques to address several  open research questions in this area (for example, how  to measure security against quantum attacks when a  quantum computer has not yet been built). Submitters  from around the world are invited to propose  quantum-resistant cryptosystems for consideration  by NIST as part of the PQC standardization process.  In December 2016, after resolving and assessing  public comments, NIST issued the fnal submission  requirements and evaluation criteria. NIST has  received several proposals, and the fnal submission  deadline is in November 2017.  In FY 2018, NIST will continue to explore the  security and feasibility of purported quantum- resistant technologies submitted to the Post-Quantum  Standardization Process. NIST will hold a public  workshop in April 2018, co-located with the PQCrypto  conference in Florida, during which submitters will be  invited to present their algorithms. The Post-Quantum  Standardization Process will proceed with multiple  rounds of public evaluation and analysis, with the goal  of selecting algorithms for standardization by NIST  after three to fve years of analysis.

In practice, it is important to be able to  reduce the size and depth of these circuits. Size impacts  energy consumption and power requirements. Depth  largely determines the speed at which the functions  are evaluated by the circuit. This reduction problem  is closely related to designing small (and low-depth)  combinational circuits, which contain only logical  gates (i.e., no registers are used, and there is no clock).  Figure 18 below shows one such circuit, for performing  inversion in GF(24).  Finding optimal combinational circuits is MAX- SNP Complete. In practice, this means that it is  necessary to settle for methods that design “good”  circuits, as opposed to provably optimal circuits. CSD  has developed and implemented new solutions for  the circuit-minimization problem. There is a tradeof  between the size and depth of circuits. Heuristics that  do well with respect to one of these metrics tend to do  so at the expense of the other one. In cooperation with  colleagues at the University of Southern Denmark,  CSD developed a new heuristic that simultaneously  reduces size and depth.

For a function  to be secure (in particular, one-way), it must be the  case that any circuit that implements it is sufciently  complex. In particular, a function is insecure if it can be  implemented by a circuit containing too few Boolean  AND gates. This security metric — the number of AND  gates necessary and sufcient to implement a function  — is called multiplicative complexity. Unfortunately,  determining multiplicative complexity is extremely  hard. In previous years, the CSD was able to determine  the multiplicative complexity of all Boolean functions  on up to fve input bits. This year the team was able  to do the same for all functions on six inputs (there  are 264 such functions). ITL was able to exhibit specifc  functions on n bits which are impossible to calculate  with fewer than n AND gates. Also as a result of  this classifcation, it was possible to determine the  multiplicative complexity of the symmetric function  S(8,4) – problems that had remained unresolved for  many years.  Secure multi-party computation is a technique  that allows a group of people to compute a function of  their inputs without revealing the inputs themselves.  Examples of this are: 1) holding an election; 2)  conducting closed-bid auctions in which only the  winning bid is determined; 3) proving to a third party  that a person’s encrypted attributes satisfy some  requirement, such as being “over 21 and (U.S. citizen  or Canadian citizen)”. The protocols that solve secure  multi-party computation problems often encrypt  bits using arithmetic modulo 2. The complexity of  such protocols largely depends on the number of  multiplications required. Hence, expressing functions  as a circuit with only a few multiplication (AND) gates  is important. Some of the circuits published are now  a standard reference for the benchmarking of secure  multi-party computation protocols.  The results on circuit size and depth, and on  multiplicative complexity were presented at the 2nd  International Workshop on Boolean Functions and  their Applications (Bergen, Norway). Circuits are  periodically posted at https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/  Circuit-Complexity/Circuit-Problems.

Examples  of these areas include automotive systems, sensor  networks, healthcare, distributed control systems,  the Internet of Things (IoT), cyber-physical systems,  and the smart grid. Security and privacy can be very  important in these areas. Because most of the modern  cryptographic algorithms were designed for desktop/  server environments, many of these algorithms  cannot be implemented in the constrained devices  used by these applications. When current NIST- approved algorithms can be engineered to ft into  the limited resources of constrained environments,  their performance may not be acceptable. For these  reasons, NIST started a lightweight cryptography  project in 2013 that was tasked with determining the  need and developing a strategy for the standardization  of lightweight cryptographic algorithms.  In October 2016, CSD held the Second Lightweight  Cryptography Workshop for representatives from  government, industry, and academia. The workshop led  to the publication of NISTIR 8114, Report on Lightweight  Cryptography. This report provides an overview of  the lightweight cryptography project at NIST, and  describes a plan for the standardization of lightweight  cryptographic algorithms. A draft whitepaper, Profles  for the Lightweight Cryptography Standardization  Process, was released for public comment in order  to receive community feedback on the goals for the  frst set of NIST lightweight cryptography standards.  The functionality that will be requested for this frst  set of standards are authenticated encryption with  associated data (AEAD) with optional hashing. A  call for algorithm submissions for the lightweight  cryptography portfolio will be announced in FY 2018,  along with details of the selection process.  NISTIR 8114 and the Lightweight Cryptography  project were featured in the June 2017 ITL bulletin,  and CSD presented a poster on the project during  ITL Science Day in October 2016. The Lightweight  Cryptography project was presented at several venues  in FY 2017, including Real World Crypto, HighLight:  High Security Lightweight Cryptography, and the rump  sessions of the Eurocrypt and Crypto conferences.

Such  heterogeneous networks demand integrated security  solutions. CSD has worked closely with diferent  working groups in the IEEE 802 LAN/MAN Standards  Committee since 2006 and made solid contributions  to the security solutions for wireless networks. The  NIST team has been involved in the IEEE 802.11 and  IEEE 802.21 working groups to develop standards  for cryptographic key management schemes for the  mobility environment. NIST cryptographic standards  have been extensively used in the wireless standards  developed in the IEEE 802 community.  In FY 2017, NIST researchers continuously  collaborated with the IEEE 802.21 Working Group.  IEEE 802.21 “Media Independent Handover Services  Framework” was published, and IEEE 802.21.1 “Media  Independent Services” was fnalized for publication.  These new standards address the future connectivity  and management requirements of Smart Grid, IoT and  Smart Home networks, where multimode wireless  devices and smart end nodes incorporate diferent  wireless interfaces, and need to switch among the  networks during an ongoing communication session,  while maintaining the same security posture. IEEE  802.21 and IEEE 802.21.1 adopted NIST standardized  cryptographic algorithms, such as ECDSA, as specifed  in FIPS 186-4, and AES-CCM, as specifed in SP 800- 38C.  59  https://www.nist.gov/programs-projects/lightweight-cryptography https://www.nist.gov/programs-projects/lightweight-cryptography https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/itl-bulletin/2017/06/toward-standardizing-lightweight-cryptography/final https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/itl-bulletin/2017/06/toward-standardizing-lightweight-cryptography/final https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/itl-bulletin/2017/06/toward-standardizing-lightweight-cryptography/final mailto:lawrence.bassham@nist.gov mailto:kerry.mckay@nist.gov mailto:meltem.turan@nist.gov  ITL CYBERSECURITY PROGRAM AND PROJECTS  |  FY 2017  Tlmestamp  Nonce  Tim e  Tlmestamp  Nonce  T1mestamp  Nonce  The recently revealed KRACK attack on the IEEE  802.11 wireless network leads to generating the same  key stream in the case of AES-CCM, or recovering the  authentication key, in the case of AES-GCM through  a man-in-the-middle attack to create a counter  reset condition. The KRACK attack confrms that it is  essential to make sure that the special features and  assumptions for using each cryptographic algorithm  are considered in the protocol design so that the  requirements are satisfed to assure security in any  circumstance.  In FY 2018, CSD will continue to contribute to IEEE  802 wireless standards. CSD will work with the IEEE  802.11 working group to develop countermeasures for  the KRACK attack.  CONTACT:  Dr. Lily Chen  (301) 975 -6974  lily.chen@nist.gov  Blockchains  CSD began studying the use of blockchains,  which have been suggested as a solution for  many applications. A  blockchain  is a distributed  database that maintains a continuously growing  list of records called blocks that are secured from  undetected modifcation using a hash function.  Each block contains a link to the previous block. A  new block is added to the chain only when multiple  parties (possibly mutually untrusted parties) agree  to its accuracy. In essence, a blockchain is a mutually  agreed-upon record of history.  Figure 19 illustrates three blocks in a blockchain,  where each block contains at least one transaction, a  nonce and the hash value of the previous block in the  chain.  The most well-known example of the use of a  blockchain is BitCoin and similar digital currencies.  However, the use of blockchains has been proposed  for other applications, such as smart contracts and  various ledgering applications.  Many organizations have suggested applications  for the use of blockchains, some of which may not  be appropriate. CSD is investigating the use of  blockchains to determine which application types are  appropriate for using blockchains and which are not.  CSD is monitoring the proposed uses of cryptography  to assure that current cryptographic techniques  are used properly and whether new techniques are  required.  During FY 2017, NIST participated in standards  activities exploring blockchain technologies,  architectures, and use cases. These included  participation in a new blockchain study group  sponsored by American Standards Committee X9,  the fnancial services committee of the American  National Standards Institute (ANSI), and continued  work in the International Standards Organization  (ISO) Technical Committee (TC) for Blockchains  and Distributed Ledger Technologies (ISO/TC 307).  Established in 2016, the initial objectives of ISO/TC 307  include defning key terms and concepts, exploring  reference architectures, investigating use cases, and  identifying identity and privacy implications within  blockchain technologies and architectures. NIST has  Figure 19: Example of a Blockchain 60  mailto:lily.chen@nist.gov  NIST/ITL CYBERSECURITY PROGRAM ANNUAL REPORT 2017  been participating in these activities via the national  mirror committee within the InterNational Committee  for Information Technology Standards (INCITS). ISO/  TC 307 will meet in November 2017, where the reports  on these topics will be reviewed and new work will be  established.  During FY 2017, CSD established the NIST Internal  Blockchain Workbench to support internal research  exploring blockchain technologies and use cases.  The workbench itself is hosted on internal servers,  and is currently running two blockchains – the frst  is a permissioned blockchain utilizing the MultiChain  blockchain platform; the second is Ethereum,  which has been confgured to run only within the  workbench. In addition to the blockchain software  itself, the workbench has demonstration applications  with source code, software development tools and  several diagnostic tool suites available for researchers  to utilize. NIST/ITL plans to continue advancing the  capabilities of the workbench and expanding the  types of blockchains available in FY 2018.

Poor implementations of these standards  or specifcations may render a product insecure,  potentially placing sensitive information at risk. ITL  operates several validation programs that help provide  a level of assurance that products meet established  security requirements and conform to published  specifcations. To that end, the CSD develops test  suites and test methods; provides implementation  guidance and technical support to industry forums;  and conducts education, training, and outreach  programs.  CSD’s validation programs work together with  independent laboratories that are accredited by the  National Voluntary Laboratory Accreditation Program  (NVLAP). Based on independent laboratory test  reports and test evidence provided by the labs, the  validation programs described below validate the  implementation-under-test. Awarded validations are  subsequently published on NIST websites.  Cryptographic Algorithm Validation  Program (CAVP)  The Cryptographic Algorithm Validation Program  (CAVP) provides federal agencies in the United States  and Canada with assurance that a cryptographic  algorithm has been implemented completely  and correctly, as specifed in its approved Federal  Information Processing Standard (FIPS-Approved)  or NIST-recommended cryptographic algorithm  standard. The CAVP was established in 2013 as a  joint program in collaboration between NIST and  the Communications Security Establishment (CSE)  of Canada. Prior to this date, the CAVP’s functions  were included in the Cryptographic Module Validation  Program (CMVP). With the increase in the number and  complexity of FIPS-Approved and NIST-recommended  cryptographic algorithms, it was deemed necessary  to establish the CAVP as an independent program.  The CAVP’s goal is to provide federal agencies with  a security metric list to use in validating cryptographic  algorithm implementations, and promote the use  of validated algorithms by industry and the public.  The testing is carried out by independent third- party laboratories accredited by the NVLAP, and  the validations performed by the CAVP program  provide this metric. Federal agencies, industry, and  the public can choose validated implementations  of cryptographic algorithms from the CAVP  Validated Algorithms List and have confdence in the  claimed level of security and assurance of correct  implementation.  The validation of cryptographic algorithms 61  mailto:ebarker@nist.gov mailto:john.kelsey@nist.gov mailto:rene.peralta@nist.gov mailto:andrew.regenscheid@nist.gov mailto:dylan.yaga@nist.gov  ITL CYBERSECURITY PROGRAM AND PROJECTS  |  FY 2017  by the CAVP is a prerequisite to the validation of a  cryptographic module by the CMVP and is also used by  other programs outside of NIST as well. Since federal  agencies are required to use validated cryptographic  modules for the protection of sensitive unclassifed  information, the validated modules and the validated  algorithms that the modules contain represent the  culmination and delivery of CSD’s cryptography- based work to the end user.  The CAVP validation program provides  documented methodologies for conformance testing  through defned sets of security requirements. For  the CAVP, a validation system document is designed  for each FIPS-approved or NIST-recommended  cryptographic algorithm. See the website for a listing  (see https://csrc.nist.gov/groups/STM/cavp/). The  four Annexes to FIPS 140-2 reference the underlying  cryptographic algorithm standards or methods.  By the end of FY 2017, the CAVP had issued  approximately 28,710 validations, representing the  algorithm validations of approximately 18 approved  algorithms, including 5 modes of operation.

The increase in  validations is attributed to an increase in cryptographic  modules being validated and other outside programs  now requiring CAVP validated implementations,  e.g., the National Information Assurance Partnership  (NIAP).  The number of algorithms submitted for validation  continues to grow, representing signifcant growth in  the number of validations expected to be available in  the future.

Cryptographic Module Validation  Program (CMVP)  The Cryptographic Module Validation Program  (CMVP) was developed to support the federal user  communities for strong, independently tested, and  commercially available cryptographic modules.  Through this program, the CMVP works with  international government, public and private sectors  as a part of the cryptographic community to achieve  standards-based security and assurance of correct  implementation. The goal is to provide federal  agencies with a security metric list to use in procuring  and deploying validated cryptographic modules, and  promote the use of those modules by industry and  the public. The testing performed by independent  third-party laboratories accredited by NVLAP, and the  validations performed by the CMVP program provide  this metric. Federal agencies, industry, and the public  can choose cryptographic modules and/or products  containing cryptographic modules from the CMVP  Validated Modules List and have confdence in the  claimed level of security and assurance of correct  implementation.  Cryptographic module testing and validation are  based on published NIST standards. Since federal  agencies are required to use validated cryptographic  modules for the protection of sensitive unclassifed  information, the validated modules and the validated  algorithms that the modules contain represent the  culmination and delivery of the CSD’s cryptography- based work to the end user.  The CMVP validates modules that are used in a  wide variety of products, including Internet browsers,  radios, smart cards, space-based communications,  munitions, security tokens, mobile phones, network  and storage devices, and products supporting  the Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) and electronic  commerce. A module may be a standalone product,  such as a virtual private network (VPN) or smart card,  or it could be a module embedded in many products,  such as a cryptographic-based toolkit. As a result, a  small number of modules may be incorporated within  hundreds of products.  The theme for FY 2017 was modernization. As part  of the launch of the new Computer Security Resource  Center (CSRC) web site, the CMVP web pages were  redesigned and now have a new look with additional  functionality. The CMVP was automated to improve  its validation processes, the Cryptographic Validation  Program (CVP) Certifcation Exam was developed, and  collaboration was continued with the Cryptographic  Modules User Forum (CMUF) to publish new CMVP  Implementation Guidance (IG).  The CMVP uses an automation system to manage  the validation workfow. This automation continues to  reduce the administrative overhead for the program  allowing the staf to focus on addressing the technical  needs of the community. The automated system tracks  the status of each submission and identifes the order  that the submission should be reviewed, based on  when the submission was added to the CMVP queue.  In FY 2017, the CMVP awarded 271 new certifcates.  Figure 23 displays the number of certifcates that  were issued by security level.  64  https://csrc.nist.gov/groups/computer-security-division/security-testing-validation-and-measurement https://csrc.nist.gov/groups/computer-security-division/security-testing-validation-and-measurement https://csrc.nist.gov/groups/computer-security-division/security-testing-validation-and-measurement mailto:harold.booth@nist.gov  NIST/ITL CYBERSECURITY PROGRAM ANNUAL REPORT 2017  • • • •  138, 51%  103, 38%  28, 10% 2, 1%  FY 2017 CMVP Certificates  271 Total  Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Level 4  Figure 23: FY 2017 CMVP  Certifcates by Security Level  Initially, this system automated the creation and  transmittal of billing invoices, but then was further  enhanced to allow laboratories to submit those  invoices in advance of the report submission. For  laboratories and vendors who elect to take advantage  of this, the amount of time that submissions wait in  the queue prior to being assigned has been reduced,  which in turn lessens the overall time to validation.  This enhancement provides signifcant time savings  and was achieved due to the continued collaborative  efort between the CMVP and NIST Receivables.  In order to provide a greater transparency to  the laboratories, the CMVP sends a weekly report to  each laboratory providing a status of each of their  submissions. The CMVP provides those reports to  apprise the laboratories of the current state of each  submission along with their respective payment  status. This has mitigated the number of status  requests that need to be addressed by the CMVP.  Since August 2015, the CMVP produces a separate  Implementation Under Test (IUT) list from the  Modules In Process (MIP) list. The IUT list is merely  provided as a marketing service for vendors. However,  to encourage this list to be kept up to date, the CMVP  implemented a new policy to drop IUT entries that are  greater than 18 months old. The MIP list continues to  refect the status of the current work that is actively in  the validation process.  In February 2017, the CMVP adopted the fve  year Validation Sunsetting Policy that moved all  FIPS 140-1 validation entries and all validations that  were completed prior to February 1, 2012 from the  Active Validation List to the Historical Validation  List. This was done to ensure that modules on the  Active Validation List are compliant with the latest  standards and guidance. In January 2018, the CMVP  will drop modules to the historical list that have not  been validated within two years of report or billing  submission, whichever occurred frst. This is to  encourage the completion of projects and to ensure  that the MIP list refects modules that are actively in  the validation process.  In order to demonstrate profciency in the  technical areas addressed by Handbook 150-17,  NVLAP Cryptographic and Security Testing, the  CMVP activated the CVP Certifcation Exam in July  2017. This exam is now required as part of the initial  and renewal accreditation process. The profciency  testing was previously handled by the NVLAP/  CMVP technical assessors at the onsite audit, but is  now being managed through a third-party testing  facility. Each laboratory must have a minimum of two  testers who pass the exam to be eligible for initial or  renewal accreditation. The certifcation will remain  with the individual tester making it easier to access  the laboratory’s overall competency, as its staf may  change over time. In support of this efort, the CMVP  also created a web site and user’s guide that provides  information on this new certifcation process.  In September 2017, the NIST CSRC launched a new  website. In support of that efort, the CMVP updated  its web pages to include both basic and advanced  search capabilities. The basic search results in the list  of all active validated modules. The more advanced  search allows the user to search on specifc felds  and to retrieve historical and revoked certifcates. For  each validation, there are links provided to related  fles that direct the user to the module’s security  policy and to the applicable consolidated certifcate.  The consolidated certifcates are generated once a  month and include the individual validations that  were completed within that particular month. The  posting of the most current CMVP IG document was  also separated from the archived versions that are still  accessible for historical reference.  65  ITL CYBERSECURITY PROGRAM AND PROJECTS  |  FY 2017  The CMVP has maintained the relationship with  the CMUF by supporting the monthly CMUF general  membership meetings and the CMUF working  groups. The working groups are chaired by a member  of industry and/or laboratory personnel. Each  working group includes a representative from the  CMVP. The current working group tasks include the  Revalidation and Response to Common Vulnerabilities  and Exposures (CVEs), ROM Integrity Testing in  Constrained Devices, and Testing Equivalency.  Working groups are dissolved once discussions on  the topics are completed, and guidance is typically  published.  In order to provide predicable support for  vendors and laboratories needing guidance, the  CMVP implemented a quarterly IG release process.  New draft IGs and revisions to currently posted IGs  are sent out once a month to the laboratories for  comments. Vendors are encouraged to provide their  feedback, so draft IGs are also posted on the CMUF  Forum. The comments are adjudicated by the CMVP,  and the fnalized IGs are incorporated into the main  IG document, which is posted quarterly on the CMVP  web site.  For FY 2018, the CMVP is anticipating the approval  of FIPS 140-3. When approved, the CMVP will create  the necessary documents and processes to support  the transition from FIPS 140-2 to FIPS 140-3. The  CMVP will continue to:  • Invest in automation to streamline the  validation process and improve review  consistency,  • Strengthen its relationship with the CMUF by  collaborating on new and improved technical  guidance and programmatic issues, and  • Support the ICMC committee to continue  strengthening the relationship with vendors  and laboratories.

FIPS 140-2 was released on May 25, 2001  and supersedes FIPS 140-1.  The current implementation of the CMVP is shown  in Figure 24 below. The CMVP leverages the National  Voluntary Laboratory Accreditation Program (NVLAP)  accredited Cryptographic and Security Testing (CST)  laboratories for validation testing against the Derived  Test Requirements (DTR), Implementation Guidance  (IG), and applicable CMVP programmatic guidance.  According to existing guidance, the CST laboratories  must perform 100 % independent testing of the  modules submitted by the vendors.  The structure and the rules under which the CMVP  operates worked well for the level of the technology  utilized by the Federal Government when the  program was created more than two decades ago. As  technology progresses and cryptography becomes  ubiquitous in the federal IT infrastructure, the plethora  of cryptographic module validations has proven  to outstrip available human resources for vendors,  third-party testing laboratories and federal validators  alike. As the number and complexity of modules to  be validated increases, the existing methodologies  face a limit on their ability to catch and eliminate all  possible defects that could compromise the security.  Testing is exceedingly long — well beyond typical  product-development cycles across a wide range of  technologies — yet costly and inefective. The resulting  validated modules often do not provide useful  interfaces for integration into IT systems to enable  run-time monitoring of modules for compliance with  FISMA.  66  https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/cryptographic-module-validation-program/module-validation-lists https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/cryptographic-module-validation-program/module-validation-lists https://wsr.pearsonvue.com/nist-cmvp mailto:beverly.trapnell@nist.gov  NIST/ITL CYBERSECURITY PROGRAM ANNUAL REPORT 2017  Acc redit ed  Cryp1t10gr~ ph le i!!ind  5' uri y Tes.ti i  Laboratory  IVT  • La!b performs  conform :e tes- • P!1lparl?'S-tl:'f.t  report  Crypto rap hie  Mo-du le Tes.t  Ri!!!port  IUT  • vendor reques.fS Mal da oo al lmpleiromiatlon  • subm rs the modlll fortes 118 Cryp •osra p i,c  Modu I!' vl!'n d or  cvlcw- • WIM!n Is ln•roice k p,ald,  cwo CMVP rel/le ers a e  a99i.!lned and r~ili'l' t the  submitted documients  • CMVP POC is ~ne,cl tu  n nage t!M! coo rdlnaoon  phas.e  and . 40-2 Cry-ptogra ph le  Module5-Li.st  ltttp;f/<= ,ri st.ii<'Y/'1:ro\\lP~Tl\\1f,::nmi/d~140-1/1dl]y all ,h  Figure 24: Current Validation Flow  NIST recognizes the need to improve the efciency  and efectiveness of cryptographic module testing  to reduce the time and cost required for testing,  while providing a high level of assurance for Federal  Government consumers.  The principal goals of this project are to  collaborate with commercial or open source producers  of cryptographic capabilities and government  consumers of FIPS 140-validated modules to:  • Improve the efciency and efectiveness of  cryptographic module testing by adopting the  best practices used by industry;  • Develop test procedures and techniques that  provide assurance of module compliance  to FIPS 140 in an automated manner, based  on machine-readable artifacts or evidence  (examples of machine readable artifacts are  XML or JavaScript Object Notation (JSON)  fles containing logs from performed tests and  the corresponding results – see examples at  https://github.com/usnistgov/ACVP); and  • Identify techniques and procedures that  provide continued assurance of operational  compliance to FIPS 140 for cryptographic  modules throughout their lifecycle.  The scope of this project is broken into multiple  phases to be performed over several years:  Phase 1  • Identify potential approaches,  • Select the best technical approach or  approaches to prototype, and  • Document the technical approach.  Phase 2  • Develop working prototypes, and  • Evaluate the prototypes against the principal  goals.  Phase 3  • Publish a draft, provide a review period,  adjudicate the comments, and publish the  fnal version.  Phase 4  • Integrate the fnal version into the operational  CMVP program.

(SHA-2)  The conformance testing consists of a suite of  validation tests for each approved cryptographic  algorithm. These validation tests exercise the  algorithmic requirements and mathematical  formulas to assure that the detailed specifcations  are implemented correctly and completely. If the  implementer deviates from the specifcations in the  standard or excludes any part of these specifcations  or requirements, the validation test will detect the  deviations and fail. The validation testing will indicate  that the algorithm implementation does not function  properly or is incomplete.  The cryptographic algorithm validation tests  designed and developed by the CAVP are used by  independent third-party laboratories accredited by  NVLAP. The laboratory works with vendors to validate  their cryptographic algorithm implementations. The  suite of validation tests for each algorithm ensures the  repeatability of tests and the equivalency of results  across the testing laboratories.  There are several types of validation tests, all  designed to satisfy the testing requirements of the  cryptographic algorithms and their specifcations.  These include Known-Answer Tests, Monte Carlo  Tests, and Multi-Block Message Tests. The Known- Answer Tests are designed to examine the individual  components of the algorithm by supplying known  values to the variables and verifying the expected  result. Negative testing is also performed by  supplying known incorrect values to assure that  the implementation recognizes values that are not  allowed. The Monte Carlo Test is designed to exercise  the entire implementation-under-test (IUT). This test  is designed to detect the presence of implementation  faws that are not detected with the controlled input of  the Known-Answer Tests. The types of implementation  faws detected by this validation test include pointer  problems, insufcient allocation of space, improper  error handling, and incorrect behavior of the IUT.  The Multi-Block Message Test (MMT) is designed  to test the ability of the implementation to process  multi-block messages, which requires the chaining of  information from one block to the next.  During the last few years, CSD has expanded  its publications to contain not only the algorithm’s  specifcations, but also requirements for an algorithm’s  use. Many of these usage requirements do not fall  within the scope of the CAVP, because the CAVP  focuses on the correctness of the instructions within  the algorithm’s boundary. If these additional algorithm  usage requirements are not considered applicable  to the algorithm’s implementation, they cannot be  tested at the algorithm level by the CAVP, but may be  tested by the CMVP if the requirements are considered  applicable to the cryptographic module. However,  some of these usage requirements may be outside  the scope of both the algorithm implementation  and cryptographic module. In this latter case, the  fulfllment of the requirements is the responsibility of  entities using, installing, or confguring applications or  protocols that use the cryptographic algorithms. For  example, depending on the design of a cryptographic  module, it may not be possible for the module to  determine whether a specifc key is used for multiple  purposes, a situation that is strongly discouraged.

Security Content Automation  Protocol (SCAP) Validation Program  The SCAP Validation Program performs  conformance testing to ensure that products correctly  implement SCAP, as defned in SP 800-126 Revision 2,  The Technical Specifcation for the Security Content  Automation Protocol (SCAP): SCAP Version 1.2.  Conformance testing is necessary because SCAP is a  complex collection of eleven individual specifcations  that work together to support various use cases. A  single error in product implementation could result  in undetected vulnerabilities or policy noncompliance  within an organization’s networks.  The test requirements for SCAP 1.2 are defned  in NISTIR 7511, Security Content Automation  Protocol (SCAP) Version 1.2 Validation Program  Test Requirements. In general, vendors may opt for  product validation for one or more SCAP capabilities  or operating systems. Currently, the program ofers  testing on Microsoft Windows, Red Hat Enterprise  Linux, and Apple Mac OS platforms. The validation  process starts when a vendor voluntarily submits  an SCAP-enabled product to an NVLAP-accredited  laboratory. Once the lab completes product testing,  the lab submits a test report to the SCAP Validation  Program at NIST for review. NIST reviews the test  report and awards a validation if all requirements  have been met. Once a validation is awarded, the  SCAP Validation Record is sent to the lab, and the  information about the newly validated product is  posted on the SCAP Validated Products web page.

The most current  NISTIR 7511 revision, as well as SCAP capabilities and  supported platforms, are available on the home page  (see https://scap.nist.gov/validation). The resources  page includes documentation, a list of Frequently  Asked Questions (FAQ), the SCAP validation-test  content, and tools for validating and processing  SCAP data streams. The SCAP validation-test content  should be used by vendors for quality assurance  testing prior to entering formal SCAP testing with an  NVLAP-accredited laboratory. The open-source tools  that are available for download may be used by SCAP  content authors for testing the SCAP source content.  The SCAP Content Validation Tool (SCAPVal) may  be used to determine if the content conforms to the  SCAP specifcation. SCAP validated products may  be used to process SCAP data streams for use cases  such as checking compliance of target systems to a  confguration checklist.  End users may use information on the SCAP  Validation web page to learn about SCAP validation  and fnd products that have been awarded validations.  The validation records that are posted on the SCAP  Validated Products page identify the product versions  that were tested in the laboratory, along with details  about each validation, such as the tested platforms,  SCAP capabilities, the validation test suite version,  and the lab that performed the product test.  In FY 2017, NISTIR 7511 was updated in  preparation for testing conformance to SCAP 1.3,  and the validation test content was updated to  include test coverage for SCAP 1.3 and support for  new platforms. Support for Microsoft Windows 10  and Mac OS 10.11 was released in FY 2017; updates  for SCAP 1.3 will be released in FY 2018.  Vendors continued to beneft from the openly  available SCAP validation test suite reference  material. Access to the validation test suite enables  vendors to test products during development and  provides a means for verifying SCAP conformance  after operational products are patched. Through the  use of the reference materials, vendors that market  their products to federal agencies may better  prepare for formal validation testing with NVLAP  accredited laboratories. Vendors focused on the 73  https://scap.nist.gov/validation https://scap.nist.gov/validation  ITL CYBERSECURITY PROGRAM AND PROJECTS  |  FY 2017  critical infrastructure, and for which formal validation  testing may not be required, have access to reference  material that ensures that scanning products are  correctly processing SCAP content. Approximately  86 % of confguration scanning products are SCAP- validated, and SCAP product vendors continue to  engage with the SCAP Validation Program on new  releases of the validation test content. The current list  of SCAP 1.2-validated products may be found on the  SCAP Validated Products list at https://nvd.nist.gov/  scap/validated-tools.  In FY 2018, NISTIR 7511 for SCAP 1.3 and the  associated validation test suite reference material will  be released. In addition, the program will continue to  add support for new platforms (i.e., Windows Server  2016 and Mac OS 10.12). The program will continue  to collaborate with vendors, laboratories, and the  Security Automation team on updating validation  resources in a meaningful way that meets the needs  of federal agencies and the critical infrastructure.  Coordination with the Security Automation team  ensures that validation resources are developed and  released in conjunction with new releases of SCAP.

IDENTITY AND ACCESS  MANAGEMENT  NIST Personal Identity Verifcation  Program (NPIVP)  The objective of the NIST Personal Identity  Verifcation Program (NPIVP) is to validate Personal  Identity Verifcation (PIV) products for conformance  to the specifcations in FIPS 201, Personal Identity  Verifcation (PIV) of Federal Employees and  Contractors. There are three companion technical  documents:  1. SP 800-73, Interfaces for Personal Identity  Verifcation;  2. SP 800-76, Biometric Specifcations for  Personal Identity Verifcation; and  3. SP 800-78, Cryptographic Algorithms and Key  Sizes for Personal Identity Verifcation.  The two main products are: the PIV Card  Application and the PIV Middleware. The guidelines for  performing the conformance tests for these products  are themselves outlined in two technical documents  (SP 800-85A, PIV Card Application and Middleware  Interface Test Guidelines (SP 800-73-4 Compliance),  and SP 800-85B, PIV Data Model Test Guidelines);  they specify a two-step process that frst involves  the development of Derived Test Requirements  (DTRs) and then the actual test procedures. To  implement these tests and to generate conformance  test reports, CSD also developed test modules for  testing the PIV card application and PIV middleware.  These modules were provided to NPIVP test facilities  for testing and certifying the vendor submissions in  the two PIV product categories. NPIVP test facilities  are Cryptographic and Security Testing (CST)  Laboratories that were accredited by the NVLAP.  NPIVP also assisted NVLAP in the accreditation  of laboratories by developing technology-focused  assessment criteria. An additional software module to  perform conformance testing for the PIV data model  was also developed by CSD to enable GSA to provide  a toolkit to agencies for testing fully personalized PIV  cards prior to card issuance.  FIPS 201 specifes the architecture and technical  requirements for the PIV cards. Since the start of the  NPIVP, FIPS 201 has undergone two revisions and the  companion technical documents even more revisions.  The two test guidelines documents have also been  updated to be consistent with the specifcation  documents. The NPIVP team was fully involved in the  review, analysis and development of these revisions  of specifcation documents and have also ensured  that these revisions are fully refected in the two test  guidelines documents as well as in the test software  modules. The latest versions of all documents (as of  September 2017) with their URLs, as well as the URL 74  https://nvd.nist.gov/scap/validated-tools https://nvd.nist.gov/scap/validated-tools https://scap.nist.gov/validation/ mailto:michael.cooper@nist.gov  NIST/ITL CYBERSECURITY PROGRAM ANNUAL REPORT 2017  for the list of accredited NPIVP labs are given below:  Specifcation Documents:  • FIPS 201-2, Personal Identity Verifcation (PIV)  of Federal Employees and Contractors – (see  https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/FIPS/NIST.

During FY 2017, NPIVP did a major redesign of the  test software modules. The three software modules  for PIV card application conformance testing, PIV  Middleware conformance testing and PIV data model  conformance testing were all integrated into a single  comprehensive toolkit to eliminate redundancies  and inconsistencies in software codes performing  the same functionality and to make the maintenance  of the overall toolkit much easier. Further tests  pertaining to diferent card interfaces (Contact,  Contactless, Secure Messaging and Virtual Contact)  for the same command were grouped together for  easy accessibility. The redesigned test toolkit (now  called the SP 800-73-4 PIV Test Runner for PIV  Card Applications, Middleware and Data Model) has  been made freely available to the public and can be  downloaded at https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/NIST- Personal-Identity-Verifcation-Program/Software- Downloads.  NPIVP’s PIV Card Application Validation List  is available at https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/NIST- Personal-Identity-Verifcation-Program/Validation- Lists/PIV-Card-Application-Validation-List.  The PIV Middleware Validation List is available at  https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/NIST-Personal-Identity- Verifcation-Program/Validation-Lists/SP-800-73-4- PIV-Middleware-Validation-List.  During FY 2017, fve PIV card application products  were certifed and validated.

FIPS  201 was approved by the Secretary of Commerce in  February 2005. HSPD-12 called for the creation of a  new identity credential for federal employees and  contractors. FIPS 201 is the technical specifcation for  both the PIV identity credential and the PIV system  that produces, manages, and uses the credential.  Within NIST’s ITL, this work is a collaborative efort of  the CSD and the IAD. CSD activities in FY 2017 directly  supported the latest revision of FIPS 201 (i.e., FIPS 201- 2) by updating the relevant publications associated  with FIPS 201-2 and by initiating implementations  of the credential on mobile devices. CSD performed  the following activities during FY 2017 in support of  HSPD-12:  • Coordinated with the revision team in the  ACD to update SP 800-63, titled The Digital  Identity Guidelines, and ensured close  alignment with the PIV Standard in areas of  enrollment, identity proofng, authentication  and credential lifecycle management.  • With industry CRADA partners, built sample  solutions at the NCCoE to demonstrate the  issuance and use of PIV Credentials on mobile  devices using commercial technologies. For  more information visit https://nccoe.nist.gov/  projects/building-blocks/piv-credentials.  • Coordinated cybersecurity-related updates  with vendors, departments and agencies to  ease migration to stronger cryptography for  identity credentials and for a PIV system that  produces, manages, and uses the credential  -- to include the sunset of the Triple Data  Encryption Algorithm (TDEA), the upgrade  to Deterministic Random Number Generator  (DRBG).  In FY 2018, CSD will continue to focus on updating  the relevant publications associated with FIPS 201-2,  including fnalizing SP 800-116 Revision 1. CSD will also  continue to provide technical and strategic inputs to  the PIV-related initiatives.

In FY 2018, CSD will continue the above research.  CSD expects that this project will:  • Promote (or accelerate) the adoption of  community computing that utilizes the power  of shared resources and common trust- management schemes;  • Provide guidance for implementing AC  models and mechanisms for standalone or  network systems;  • Increase the security and safety of static  (connected) distributed systems by applying  the testing and verifcation tool for the AC  policies;  • Assist system architects, security  administrators, and security managers whose  expertise is related to AC or privilege policy  in managing their systems and in learning the  limitations and practical approaches for their  applications; and  • Provide accurate and efcient fault detection  and correction technology for implementing  AC rules and policies.

Faulty  policies, misconfgurations, or faws in software  implementation can result in serious vulnerabilities.  The specifcation of AC policies is often a challenging  problem. Often, a system’s privacy and security  are compromised due to the  misconfguration of  AC policies, instead of the failure of cryptographic  primitives or protocols. This problem becomes  increasingly severe as software systems become  more and more complex, and are deployed to  manage a large amount of sensitive information  and resources that are organized into sophisticated  structures. Identifying discrepancies between policy  specifcations and their intended properties is crucial  because the correct implementation and enforcement  of policies by applications is based on the premise that  the policy specifcations are correct. As a result, policy  specifcations must undergo rigorous verifcation and  validation through systematic testing to ensure that  the policy specifcations truly encapsulate the desires  of the policy authors.  To formally and precisely capture the security  properties that AC should adhere to, access control  models are usually written to bridge the rather wide  gap in abstraction between policy and mechanism.  Thus, an AC model provides unambiguous and precise  expression as well as a reference for the design and  implementation of security requirements. Techniques  are required for verifying whether an AC model is  correctly expressed in the AC policies, and whether  the properties are satisfed in the model.  Most research on AC model or policy verifcation  techniques is focused on one particular model, and  almost all of the research is in applied methods, which  require the completed AC policies as the input for  the verifcation or test processes to generate fault  reports. Even though correct verifcation is achieved,  and counter-examples may be generated when faults  are found, those methods provide no information  about the source of faults that might allow conficts  in privilege assignment, the leakage of privileges, or  a confict-of-interest in permissions. The difculty in  fnding the source of faults is increased, especially  when the AC rules are intricately covering duplicated  variables to a degree of complexity. The complexity is  because a fault might not be caused by one particular  access rule but by multiple rules that confict. Thus, it  requires manually analyzing each rule in the policy to  fnd the correct solution for correcting the fault.  To address the issue, CSD developed the ACPT,  shown in Figure 29, which allows a user to compose,  verify, test, and generate access control policies. CSD  also researched the AC Rule Logic Circuit Simulation  (ACRLCS) technique, which enables the AC authors to  detect a fault when the fault-causing AC rule is added  to the policy, so the fx can be implemented in real  time before adding other rules that further complicate  the detecting efort, rather than checking by retracing  the interrelations between rules after the policy is  completed.  In FY 2017, CSD accomplished the following:  • Published SP 800-192, Verifcation and Test  Methods for Access Control Policies/Models,  an article, Access Control Policy Verifcation  in IEEE Computer, and a conference paper,  Diferentiation Non-Isomorphic Graphs for  Graph Analytics;  • Enhanced the capability of ACPT by including  additional functions for the specifcations  of subject inheritance, separation of duty  requirements, and better user interfaces for  policy model specifcation;  • Enhanced the usability and fxed bugs of the  ACRLCS (the Access Control Rule Logic Circuit  Simulation System) to provide more policy  composing and user interface capability for  policy fault detection;  • Supported two Small Business Innovation  Research (SBIR) Phase II projects for the  access control tool and embeded function  developments; and  78  mailto:vhu@nist.gov mailto:david.ferraiolo@nist.gov mailto:kuhn@nist.gov  NIST/ITL CYBERSECURITY PROGRAM ANNUAL REPORT 2017  Templates indude .­ ABAC , World/ow, and  Multi-Level  Validates models  against properties  Access Control Policy Tool  GU/allows  specificatfon of users,  user attributes ,  actions, resources ,  resources attributes,  and properties .-----------------+-------......... ----.

For example, access to a  database could be restricted to users with particular  attributes, such as membership in a group (e.g.,  employees) and other conditions (e.g., part of the  Human Resource Department). ABAC represents a  point on the spectrum of logical access control, from  simple access control lists to more capable Role Based  Access Control (RBAC), and fnally, to a highly fexible  method for providing access based on the evaluation  of attributes.  CSD is conducting research that provides  information for using ABAC to improve information  sharing within and among organizations based on the  planning, design, implementation, and operational  considerations. The research also includes technologies  such as attribute assurance, attribute engineering/  management, identity system integration, attribute  federation, situational awareness (real-time or  contextual) mechanisms, policy management, and  natural-language policy translation to digital policy.  Figure 31 illustrates the interaction of many of these  components.  The goal of this research is to improve information  sharing, while maintaining control of that information  for federal agencies.  In FY 2017, the project team:  • Published the book Attribute-Based Access  Control by Artech House. The book contains  discussions covering almost all aspects of  ABAC;  • Published a conference paper: Verifcation of  Resilience Policies that Assist Attribute Based  Access Control. The paper presents research  results of access privilege blocking and  privilege leaking; and  • Worked with government, industry and  academic organizations in exploring diverse  models (e.g., Next Generation Access Control  - NGAC) and applications (e.g., distributed  systems: Cloud, Bigdata, IoT applications) of  ABAC.  80  https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/access-control-policy-tool https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/access-control-policy-tool mailto:vhu@nist.gov mailto:kuhn@nist.gov  NIST/ITL CYBERSECURITY PROGRAM ANNUAL REPORT 2017  ~ Ent erpri se  Enterpri se Access Control  Policy Repositor y  .... v~ olicy Manager ~ Local Access Control  , Policy Repository , , ~------ I ,, ,  ~ ~,,' Enterpri se Access Contro l  Policy Admin istration Point  Enterpri se Identit y/  Credential Manager  Subject  Att ribute Issuance  Enterpri se Subject  Attri bute  Administ ration Point  \\  \\  \\  \\  \\  \\  \\  \\  \\  \\  \\  \\  ~  Optional Enterpri se  Policy Decision Service  Credenital lnssuance  Subject  ' '  Enterpri se Subject  Attribute Shar ing  ,. , ,7 Local Subject  ' Attribute  Local Subject Attribute  Adm inist ration Point  Repository  Hierarchical Policy  Pushed to Subordinate  <- _ _ Organizations --------  Environment  Conditions  -----+  --- ~------- 1  I  Local Access Control Policy 1  Admini stration Point  Object  A Optiona l Enterpri se  ABAC\"  : Obj ect Attr ibute Bindin g 1  VI and Validation Service  ii ~  Access  Control  Mechanism  Set of Availab le  Attribute s for Policy  Development  I  I,:.,,~ ~  Object '{\",,,  Attribute  Repository  Enterpri se Object  Attribute M anager  Local Obj ect Attribute  Administration Point I __________________________________ J  Figure 31: ABAC Access Control Mechanism Chart  In FY 2018, CSD will continue the research of ABAC  formal models, as well as the details and extended  topics of ABAC capabilities, such as attribute  considerations, ABAC implementation examples,  ABAC mechanisms, and ABAC standards. The ABAC  project will pursue the following objectives:  • Provide readers with an overview of the  current state of logical access control,  a working defnition of ABAC, and an  explanation of the core and enterprise ABAC  concepts;  • Assist security policy makers in establishing a  business case for ABAC implementation and  acquiring an interoperable set of capabilities;  • Assist ABAC developers in developing  the operational requirements and overall  enterprise architecture;  • Assist ABAC administrators in establishing or  refning business processes to support ABAC;  • Promote the adoption of ABAC for a more  secure and fexible method for information  sharing in a standalone or enterprise  environment; and  • Provide testing methods for ABAC policy and  implementations.

ACD is committed  to advancing measurement science, technology, and  standards adoption to improve digital identity for  individuals and organizations alike.  In FY 2017, the Trusted Identities Program was a  key participant and driving force in the digital identity  arena for NIST’s National Cybersecurity Center of  Excellence (NCCoE). Many identity-related projects  initiated at the NCCoE leveraged the technical  expertise and experiences of, and the foundational  guidelines and practices issued by, ACD and NIST’s  broader identity program.  Through these collaborative eforts, projects  this year focused on driving the adoption of trusted  identities through digital identity standards, including  for federal agencies. NIST also engaged the community  on standards and guidelines development, including  issuing SP 800-63-3, Digital Identity Guidelines,  collaborating with other countries to advance high- assurance online identity standards, and participating  in the OpenID Foundation and Fast Identity Online  (FIDO) Alliance.  ACD  also focused on building trust in digital  identity technologies by advancing measurement  science in the identity space—which included  measuring the strength of authenticators and  evaluating attribute metadata. The team also  continued work with numerous external partners  through trusted identities pilots, seeding the market  with innovative technologies and providing solutions.  Updated Digital Identity Guidelines  In June of 2017, ACD  fnalized the latest revision  to SP 800-63-3, which covers digital identity from  initial risk assessment to deployment of federated  identity solutions. Digital identity in both agencies  and the market place have changed dramatically  since the publication’s last revision in 2013; the latest  update was designed to give agencies more options  and to align with international standards. One of  the most signifcant updates is replacing levels of  assurance with three individual components of the  digital identity fow for more fexibility in design and  operations: the identity, authenticator, and federation  assurance levels. Identity proofng was also updated  to further mitigate the potential for mass breaches of  personal information.  Over the course of a year, the document evolved  with the help of the community. For this revision,  GitHub was used to interact in near-real-time with  the community and received a tremendous response:  over 1,400 comments were submitted, and the web  version of the publication drew over 74,000 unique  visitors between May 2016 and May 2017. ACD will  continue to use this approach in the future during the  development of new volumes and document revisions.  International Standards Alignment  ACD, the United Kingdom Cabinet Ofce, and the  Canada Treasury Board have been collaborating to  compare national frameworks for identity assurance  with the intention of creating a broad and competitive  global market for identity solutions and enabling  cross-border credential interoperability. Building on  recent updates to guidance documents like NIST’s  SP 800-63-3 and the UK’s Good Practice Guides,  the group made several recommendations for the  International  Organization for Standardization’s  (ISO’s) suite of identity standards. These  recommendations included the development of a new  standard that provides an overall approach to identity  and authentication risk management and assurance;  organizations could leverage this when developing  their models for assessing and managing identity- based risks and threats.  The group also recommended refocusing ISO/IEC  29115, Entity Authentication Assurance Framework, to  address authentication threats and risks exclusively.  These updates should contain a threat model, controls  and mitigations, and guidance on how these can  be combined to achieve defned risk management  outcomes for authentication events.  NIST staf members served as the Federal  Government lead for all activities in the (Fast IDentity  Online) FIDO Alliance, which focuses on creating 82  https://www.nist.gov/itl/tig  NIST/ITL CYBERSECURITY PROGRAM ANNUAL REPORT 2017  strong authentication specifcations to create an  identity ecosystem. During 2017, ACD participation  included active membership and contribution in  technical and privacy working groups, as well as  international plenary participation in Hong Kong,  Vancouver, Madrid, and Sydney.  Additionally, ACD supported standardization  eforts including iGov (see https://openid.net/wg/  igov). The iGov is working toward an OpenID Connect  specifcation that will enable users to authenticate and  share consented attribute information with public- sector services across the globe. The resulting profle  will enable standardized integration with public-sector  relying parties (RPs) in multiple jurisdictions.  Authenticator Strength of Function  NIST is working to produce a framework  for evaluating and comparing the strength of  authentication solutions, starting with the Strength of  Function for Authenticators – Biometrics (SOFA-B).  The team began with a focus on biometrics, due to  the increased availability of biometric solutions in the  consumer space and the need for improved security  guidance regarding the use of those solutions as  authenticators. The end goal is a framework to  assess and combine authentication technologies, as  well as to compare biometrics’ efectiveness to that  of passwords and other authenticators. Using the  SOFA-B framework, RPs will be able to determine  the overall strength of biometric authentication,  considering matching performance, presentation  attack detection, and the efort required to break – or  spoof – a system.  With the draft of NISTIR 8112: A Proposed Schema  for Evaluating Federated Attributes, the TIG aims to  give RPs greater insight into how attributes assist  with risk-based business decision-making. RPs can  examine this metadata and determine if they have  the confdence they need in the attribute value before  making an authorization decision. This NISTIR is being  treated like  an implementers’ draft, an approach  focused on real-world implementation results and  lessons learned before fnalizing the document. ACD  plans to advance SOFA-B and attribute metadata  eforts to their next stages in FY 2018.  Innovative Digital Identity Solutions  ACD has advanced  trusted digital identity  solutions by building partnerships that stem from  the trusted identities pilots. These pilots develop  and deploy technology, models, and frameworks  that would not otherwise  exist in the marketplace,  and have impacted more than 8.8 million individuals  to date. In FY 2017, the pilots made remarkable  progress: the 24 projects now involve more than 190  partner organizations across 12 sectors — including  the development or deployment of 16 multi-factor  authentication solutions.  In FY 2018, NIST, through the NCCoE, will fully  integrate identity management standards, best  practices, and technical approaches into projects that  are foundational to the work of the NCCoE and many  of its stakeholders and projects, including the Internet  of Things. The project will also continue to advance  the digital identity marketplace by collaborating with  partners on measurement science, technology, and  standards adoption, and develop guidance to meet  today’s digital identity needs.

CSD tracks software  security vulnerabilities (in the National Vulnerability  Database), and seeks techniques for the measurement  of security vulnerabilities and techniques that reduce  the impact and prevalence of security vulnerabilities  in newly developed products or in new versions of  existing products.  One approach to reducing the number of  security vulnerabilities in software is to improve the  development tools that are available. By identifying  languages and software development tools that  support a reduction of vulnerabilities, and by  stimulating the creation of better tools and tool  usage techniques, the approach has the potential  to help developers produce applications with fewer  vulnerabilities. While it is impossible to assure the  total absence of security vulnerabilities in this way, it  might well be possible to rule out specifc, signifcant  classes of vulnerabilities that currently provide the  basis for many serious exploits.  CSD is developing an empirical, competitive  approach to fnding the most efective and usable  combinations of tools to produce software systems  that are relatively free of exploitable vulnerabilities.  Multiple competitions are planned that will be based  on an idea developed during the Designing a Secure  Systems Engineering Competition Workshop that was  conducted by the National Science Foundation in  2010. The workshop proposed a competition for the  development of a set of tools to help non-security- expert developers to rapidly build a signifcant  application with zero vulnerabilities, as detected by  an extensive public test suite.  The participants in the planned competitions  will implement software systems to solve challenge  problems using software development tool chains  (“toolchains”) of their own choosing, within specifed  time periods. The toolchains will be free to include  existing technologies (e.g., existing software libraries  and frameworks, code generators, reusable source  code, or bug-fnding tools), novel technologies, or  any combination thereof. Each competition will apply  time pressure by simulating a deadline in the software  development process, increasing the likelihood of  an introduction of security faws. The objective of  the toolchains will be to detect or prevent security  faws while still supporting the quick-paced software  development of applications with rich feature  sets. Through the demonstration of security-faw  avoidance in a time-constrained setting, CSD will seek  to show that wide-scale improvements in the overall  security of software products can be realized without  sacrifcing a time-to-market goal. The competitions,  which will be open to all interested parties, will aim  to provide consistent application and measurement  of commercial and research software development,  composition, and reuse techniques.  In FY 2017, CSD personnel documented the  Toolchain Infrastructure (TCI) in a collection of  documents that included a concept of operations,  system design specifcation, and administrator’s  and users guides. These documents helped inform  the development of a python-based prototype of  the TCI. The prototype development efort included  automated unit test scripts for the TCI and the  confguration and deployment of the TCI hardware.  The team also refned a selected challenge problem  by updating the problem descriptions, requirements,  and test cases; and developed an exemplar challenge  problem solution in python.  In FY 2018, CSD plans to complete the  development and testing of the TCI prototype. The  team will enhance the prototype to further improve  its reliability and reproducibility, perform extensive  testing of the TCI, and publicly announce the frst  toolchain competition.

It is  expected to impact everything from healthcare  delivery, to how food is produced, to how we work, to  all forms of transportation and communication, and  to virtually all forms of automation. IoT will impact  everyone, and in multiple ways.  With a technology revolution of such large impact  on society, it is imperative that IoT-based systems  can be trusted. This means that they should exhibit  secure, reliable, and private behaviors as well as many 84  mailto:lee.badger@nist.gov mailto:christopher.johnson@nist.gov  NIST/ITL CYBERSECURITY PROGRAM ANNUAL REPORT 2017  other attributes associated with quality. Privacy is  particularly important because IoT-based systems  will likely produce huge amounts of data as a result  of sensing and surveillance. This is the “big data”  challenge associated with IoT. Therefore, techniques,  tools, and methods to mitigate the numerous “trust”  challenges are needed before these automated IoT- based networks manage much of daily life.  In July 2016, NIST released SP 800-183, Networks  of ‘Things’, which addressed the question: “What is the  science, if any, underlying IoT?” After releasing that  document, NIST has begun to look at how to apply  the principles in the document in a practical setting,  with a focus on healthcare. NIST has also looked at  the security and privacy of virtual assistants, and how  a network of things with low inherent testability can  be tested.  Future work in this area will refne the defnitions  of the fve core networks of things building blocks  as presented in SP 800-183. For example, instead of  considering all temperature sensors as equal, NIST will  create categories of sensors for various applications  and vertical domains. Furthermore, a small IoT lab  to test “low-energy” devices is being architected.  In addition, NIST plans to present these results in  Revision 1 of SP 800-183, which are expected to be  produced in by the end of 2018.

During his talk, Intermediaries in Cloud- Computing, which was presented at the Institute for  Operations Research and the Management Sciences  (INFORMS) meeting in Dallas, Texas, he referred to  a cloud as an important new “computing paradigm  where the boundaries of computing will be determined  by economic rationale rather than technical limits  alone.” The international IT literature and media later  provided many defnitions, models, and architectures,  but it was not until 2011, when NIST published SP 800- 145, The NIST Defnition of Cloud Computing, that the  world coalesced on the cloud deployment and service  models, defnitions and descriptions provided in SP  800-145.  Following the December 2010 Federal  Government’s “Cloud First” policy issued as part of  the 25-point plan for the U.S. Federal Government’s  (USG) IT modernization and reform, NIST assumed  a technical leadership role for the federal agencies’  eforts related to the adoption and development of  cloud computing standards. The goal was to accelerate  the Federal Government’s adoption of secure and  efective cloud computing solutions to reduce costs  and improve services.  In addition to the initial defnition of cloud  computing, NIST built a USG cloud computing  technology roadmap that focused on security,  interoperability, and portability requirements, and  lead eforts to develop standards and guidelines in  close collaboration with standards bodies, the private  sector, and other stakeholders. NIST also developed  a cloud computing reference architecture, a security  reference architecture and, during 2017, focused on  developing the guidance for applying a risk-based  approach to cloud adoption and the guidance for  leveraging the NIST Cybersecurity Framework in the  process of architecting a cloud-based system secured  with SP 800-53 Revision 4 security and privacy  controls.  During FY 2017, NIST also researched the security  challenges encountered when leveraging application  containers and microservices for the implementation  of cloud-based federal information systems, along  with the impact on the system’s security posture.  Details regarding the latest projects are provided  below.  85  https://dx.doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-183 https://www.nist.gov/topics/internet-things-iot mailto:jeff.voas@nist.gov  ITL CYBERSECURITY PROGRAM AND PROJECTS  |  FY 2017  NIST is also leading the research and development CSD Role in the NIST Cloud  of the projects listed below: Computing Program  During FY 2017, NIST continued to promote the  development of publications, national and international  standards, and specifcations in support of the USG’s  efective and secure use of cloud computing, as well  as providing technical guidance to federal agencies  for secure and efective cloud-computing adoption.  During FY 2017, NIST’s cloud computing security and  forensic science activities included the development  of the following guidance and/or recommendations:  • NIST Draft SP 800-173, Guide for Applying the  Risk Management Framework to Cloud-based  Federal Information Systems. This publication  initially focused on providing guidance in  using the Risk Management Framework  described in SP 800-37 Revision 1, Guide for  Applying the Risk Management Framework to  Federal Information Systems: a Security Life  Cycle Approach, to issue an authorization to  operate for cloud-based information systems.  As SP 800-37 underwent revision in late FY  2017, and is anticipated to be fnalized in  early FY 2018, the draft of SP 800-173 will be  updated to refect all changes incorporated  in the SP 800-37 Rev. 2 and will be posted for  public comment after publication of SP 800- 37 Rev. 2.  • NIST Draft SP 800-174, Security and  Privacy Controls for Cloud-based Federal  Information Systems. This document provides  a methodology that leverages the NIST  Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) to architect  a cloud-based information system and to  identify security controls deemed necessary  to implement in order to secure the system.  The document will be available for public  comment in the frst quarter of FY 2018. The  document will be accompanied by a tool,  Cloud Security Architecture Tool (CSAT), that  implements the methodology described in SP  800-174 and allows users to customize their  data and tailor their security controls. The tool  repository is available at: https://github.com/  usnistgov/CloudSecurityArchitectureTool.  • Members of the NIST Cloud Security Working  Group, in collaboration with the Cloud Security  Alliance’s members, researched the security  challenges encountered when leveraging  application containers and microservices  for the implementation of cloud-based  information systems. Based on this research,  ITL will publish (in early FY 2018) the NIST  Interagency Report (NISTIR) documenting the  fndings and will provide recommendations  based on the best practices for mitigating the  identifed challenges.  • Members of the NIST Cloud Security Working  Group are researching the security challenges  encountered when implementing cloud-based  federated identity solutions and the impact  on the overall system’s security posture.  Based on this research, NIST will issue an  interagency report documenting the fndings  and will provide recommendations based on  the best practices for mitigating the identifed  challenges.  • Members of the NIST Cloud Forensic Science  Working Group are working on defning  a cloud forensics reference architecture  that leverages SP 500-299: Cloud Security  Reference Architecture and NISTIR 8006,  NIST Cloud Computing Forensic Science  Challenges. In support of U.S. cloud- computing mandates, CSD staf members  provide leadership for several public cloud  working groups operating under the NIST  Cloud Computing Program. These working  groups focus on meeting the high-priority  requirements described in SP 500-293, U.S.  Government Cloud Computing Technology  Roadmap.  CSD staf co-chaired several signifcant cloud  computing eforts in 2017:  • Co-Chaired the NIST Cloud Computing  Security Working Group and led the working  group on the development of the NIST  research on Application Containers and  Microservices – security challenges and 86  https://github.com/usnistgov/CloudSecurityArchitectureTool https://github.com/usnistgov/CloudSecurityArchitectureTool  NIST/ITL CYBERSECURITY PROGRAM ANNUAL REPORT 2017  best practices. The result of this efort will  materialize in FY 2018 into the development of  a NIST Interagency Report and a NIST Special  Publication.  • Co-Chaired the NIST Cloud Computing  Forensic Science Working Group and led the  development of SP 800-201, Cloud Forensics  Reference Architecture, which is currently in  progress.  • Co-Chaired the NIST Cloud Computing  Interoperability and Portability Working  Group and addressed issues facing cloud  computing with respect to interoperability  and portability, standards, and common and  functional terminologies. CSD staf members  participated in various standards development  organizations, all listed in the section of this  report dedicated to international standards.  In FY 2018, NIST will continue collaboration  with the private sector, academia and other  public-sector entities on developing guidance  and specifcations that support the broad  adoption of innovative cloud solutions. Some  of the very efective frameworks for such  collaborations that NIST is hosting are the  public working groups, with international  participation.

This exponential increase is fueled  by the proliferation of mobile devices (e.g., mobile  phones and tablets), smart sensors serving diferent  vertical markets (e.g., smart power grids, autonomous  transportation, industrial controls, smart cities,  wearables, etc), wireless sensors and actuators  networks. New concepts and technologies are needed  to manage this growing feet of Internet of Things  (IoT) devices in a manner that ensures minimal latency  across a distributed and decentralized model.  Researchers working with system and network  engineers are continually developing innovative  solutions to fll the technological gaps. Many of these  solutions or computational paradigms have begun  to be referred to as fog computing, mist computing,  cloudlets, or edge computing. Lacking broad  consensus on the distinction among these concepts,  NIST facilitated an efort to better defne these topics  to help facilitate meaningful conversations among  practitioners and researchers.  During FY 2017, NIST collaborated with the IoT  community to develop SP 500-325, Fog Computing  Conceptual Model. This publication provides the  conceptual model of fog computing and its subsidiary  concept, mist computing, and identifes these  concepts in relation to cloud computing, cloudlets,  and edge computing.  The fog computing research will continue in FY  2018 with the development of the draft of SP 800- 199, Security and Privacy Controls for Fog-based  Information Systems. This document, also referred to  as the fog computing overlay, will identify the security  and privacy controls specifc to fog computing  ecosystems, allowing users of this computational  model to build resilient and survivable standalone  fog computing environments that are more resistant  to penetration attacks and are capable of limiting the  damage from attacks when they occur.

To this end, the  Program hosted the IoT Cybersecurity Colloquium  in Gaithersburg to better understand the overall  threat landscape from the point of view of the  community (see https://www.nist.gov/news-events/  events/2017/10/iot-cybersecurity-colloquium). The  presenters discussed specifc security and privacy risks  and NIST’s role in supporting these areas. The team  is currently drafting a NISTIR on the presentations,  themes, and community feedback.  Additionally, NIST and DHS co-chair the IoT Task  Group of the Interagency International Cybersecurity  Standardization Working Group (IICS WG). The  IICS WG established the Task Group to determine  the present state of international IoT cybersecurity  standards. The Task Group has 54 federal employee  participants representing 13 agencies and will  convene in early FY 2018 to determine the next steps  for its draft report. If approved, NIST is prepared to  take this document through the NISTIR process in FY  2018 to collect industry input on specifc areas, such  as market adoption and challenges associated with  the adoption of existing standards.  In FY 2018, the Cybersecurity for IoT Program  will continue collaborating with stakeholders as NIST  begins drafting guidance for IoT security and privacy.  As part of the drafting process, the team will hold  town-hall meetings for input on discussion drafts. The  document is intended to educate federal agencies  on common high-level security and privacy risks  for IoT, and to introduce practical risk management  considerations for IoT product selection, deployment,  protection, and operation.  Additional information regarding the broad  portfolio of NIST activities for supporting secure IoT  can be found on our program website.

The Policy Machine (PM) is a fundamental  reworking of traditional access control into a form  suited to the needs of a modern, distributed,  interconnected enterprise. The PM is based on a  fexible infrastructure that can provide access control  services for several diferent types of resources that  are accessed by diferent types of applications and  users. The PM infrastructure is scalable and can  support policies of various types simultaneously  while remaining manageable in the face of changing  technology, organizational restructuring, and  increasing amounts of data. The PM provides a  framework capable of supporting combinations of  both current access control approaches and newly  conceived types of policy without extensions.  NIST and other members of an Ad Hoc INCITS  working group are continuing to develop a three-part  NGAC standard. This work is being conducted under  three sub-projects:  • Project 2193–D: Next Generation Access  Control – Implementation Requirements,  Protocols and API Defnitions;  • Project 2194–D: Next Generation Access  Control – Functional Architecture; and  • Project 2195–D: Next Generation Access  Control – Generic Operations and Abstract  Data Structures. 88  https://www.nist.gov/news-events/events/2017/10/iot-cybersecurity-colloquium https://www.nist.gov/news-events/events/2017/10/iot-cybersecurity-colloquium https://www.nist.gov/programs-projects/nist-cybersecurity-iot-program https://www.nist.gov/programs-projects/nist-cybersecurity-iot-program mailto:Katerina.megas@nist.gov mailto:Benjamin.piccarreta@nist.gov  NIST/ITL CYBERSECURITY PROGRAM ANNUAL REPORT 2017  An initial standard from this work was published  in 2013 and is now available from ANSI as INCITS  499: NGAC Functional Architecture (NGAC-FA) (see  http://www.techstreet.com/standards/incits/499_  draft?product_id=1827386). However, based on  experience with similar eforts (e.g., Project 2193-D,  Project 2195-D, and the revised NISTIR 7987, Policy  Machine: Features, Architecture, and Specifcation).  This standard has been updated and was in the  process of formal publication at the end of FY 2017.  In addition, as of the end of FY 2017, the work on  Project 2193-D had been submitted to ANSI as INCITS  525: NGAC Implementation Requirements, Protocols  and API Defnitions (NGAC-IRPADS), for approval for  an initial public review.  The standard for Project 2195-D has been approved  and is now available from the ANSI e-standards store  as INCITS 526: NGAC Generic Operations and Abstract  Data Structures (NGAC-GOADS).  The eXtensible Access Control Markup  Language (XACML) and NGAC are very diferent  ABAC standards with similar goals and objectives.  What are the similarities and diferences between  these two standards?  What are  their comparative  advantages and disadvantages? To answer these  questions, in October 2016 NIST published SP 800- 178, A Comparison of Attribute Based Access Control  (ABAC) Standards for Data Service Applications:  Extensible Access Control Markup Language (XACML)  and Next Generation Access Control (NGAC),  to describe and compare these standards with  respect to the criteria derived from ABAC issues or  considerations identifed by SP 800-162, Guide to  Attribute Based Access Control (ABAC) Defnition  and Considerations: operational efciency, attribute  and policy management, scope and type of policy  support, and support for administrative review and  resource discovery.  In FY 2017, CSD issued the frst version of the  Policy Machine Web Services through GitHub as  an open-source distribution to support widespread  experimentation of web-based applications. The  current version of the web services supports most  NGAC functionality. In order to provide an example  of web-based clients, CSD is planning to issue an  administrative interface for policy management,  which will also include a user interface with PIV  authentication (if feasible) and some sample  applications (e.g., email, fle management, records  management, document editor, workfow, etc.).  In FY 2018, CSD will continue improving the Web  services version of the Policy Machine to include  the remaining NGAC functionalities and more  applications to provide diferent use cases to support  the community’s use of the Policy Machine.

An IT infrastructure can be  looked upon as having fve components or resources:  Hardware, Operating System (OS), and Applications  that collectively form a compute node, together with  network and storage components that provide the  function of interconnecting the computing nodes  and supporting a persistent medium for storing  data respectively. Any of these fve resources can be  virtualized by building an abstraction layer on top of  it, facilitating efcient utilization of that resource by  other components or resources as well as providing a  degree of isolation among the utilizing components.  The earliest component to be virtualized was  the hardware (ubiquitously referred to as Server  Virtualization) through an abstraction layer (software  module) called the Hypervisor. This gave rise to  an architecture where multiple computing stacks  (called Virtual Machines or VMs) each with a diferent  OS can be run on a single physical host (called a  virtualized host). To connect the various VMs residing  in a single physical host, an approach to networking  (called the Virtual Network) had to be implemented.  The Virtual Network used the software analogs of  89  http://www.techstreet.com/standards/incits/499_draft?product_id=1827386 http://www.techstreet.com/standards/incits/499_draft?product_id=1827386 mailto:david.ferraiolo@nist.gov  mailto:gopi.katwala@nist.gov https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/policy-machine  ITL CYBERSECURITY PROGRAM AND PROJECTS  |  FY 2017  Application Scheduling  Container Scheduling  Service Discovery  Container Cluster Management  Container Networking  .g;;;,;;;  Container Runtime  Container OS  Physical Host (or VM)  Container Runtime  Container OS  Physical Host (or VM)  DevOps Tools  hardware network devices such as network interface  cards (NICs) and switches. Thus, the Virtual Network  (which was later extended to connect virtualized  hosts themselves in addition to VMs inside a single  virtualized host) became an integral part of the server  virtualization infrastructure. From FY 2014 to FY 2016,  this project focused on providing guidelines for the  secure confguration and deployment of hypervisors  and virtual networks.  The next component to be virtualized was the OS  itself. The application component of the computing  stack was packaged into multiple self-contained  lightweight software elements called Application  Containers. The abstraction of the OS itself was  enabled by a software module called “Container  Runtime”. This form of virtualization brought in  several new technology components involved in  building containers, storing them in repositories  (called registries) and deploying and managing them  (through a process called orchestration) as logical  groups (called clusters). The resulting computing  stack with all these new components is shown in  Figure 32 as the Container Technology stack.  With the increasing adoption of application  container technology for deploying, managing and  maintaining applications, NIST identifed threats to  components involved in supporting containers as well  as the security countermeasures to mitigate the efect  of those threats through SP 800-190, Application  Container Security Guide (see https://nvlpubs.nist.  gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-190.  pdf).  In FY 2017, building on the information in SP 800- 190, this project examined potential security solutions  that provide the necessary countermeasures as well as  the kind of security assurance requirements that each  solution should satisfy in accordance with NISTIR 8176,  Security Assurance Requirements for Linux Application  Container Deployments (see https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/  nistpubs/ir/2017/NIST.IR.8176.pdf). Because security  solutions for containers vary signifcantly based on  Figure 32: Container Technology Stack  90  https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-190.pdf https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-190.pdf https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-190.pdf https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/ir/2017/NIST.IR.8176.pdf https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/ir/2017/NIST.IR.8176.pdf  NIST/ITL CYBERSECURITY PROGRAM ANNUAL REPORT 2017  the OS component (shown as Container OS in Figure  32) and because of their ubiquitous usage in container  deployments, NISTIR 8176 focused on Linux OS- based environments. This decision enabled detailed  security assurance requirements to be defned.  Furthermore, the team recognized that there are  multiple hypervisor products for server virtualization  in current infrastructures. This observation led the  team to modify previous security recommendations to  improve countermeasures against potential threats to  the hypervisor. These countermeasures are agnostic  to any specifc architecture of the hypervisor platform.  The modifed recommendations were published  for public comment in the second draft of SP 800- 125A, Security Recommendations for Hypervisor  Deployment (see https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/  detail/sp/800-125a/draft).  NIST contributed signifcant material that led  to the creation of ISO/IEC Committee Draft 21878,  Security Guidelines for Design and Implementation  of Virtualized Servers, in April 2017. The draft was co- edited by a CSD computer scientist and drew from  information in seven NIST conference papers and  four technical publications regarding security for the  virtualized infrastructure.  NIST recognizes that application container  technology is being increasingly used to develop  applications with microservices-based architectures.  In FY 2018, this project plans to focus on security issues  arising from technology components involved in that  architecture. Developments in virtual networking  and virtual storage technologies will be monitored  to update our security recommendations for secure  deployment of these technologies.

Cyber threat information includes  indicators (i.e., artifacts or observable events that  suggest that an attack is imminent, that an attack is  underway, or that a compromise may have already  occurred); information about the tactics, techniques,  and procedures (TTPs) of actors; recommended  courses of action; and other information that is used to  characterize threats. Because threat actors often use  the same TTPs against multiple targets, exchanging  cyber threat information allows organizations to  leverage the collective knowledge, experience, and  analysis capabilities of their peers, thereby increasing  the overall awareness and security of an entire  sharing community. Through the exchange of cyber  threat information, organizations can gain a more  complete understanding of their threat environment  by correlating their observations with those of others.  CSD has established a cyber threat information- sharing initiative, which is focused on providing  guidance on how an organization can establish  information sharing and coordination capabilities  that enhance or augment their existing cybersecurity  practices. The guidance covers threat-informed  detection, protection and response capabilities; data  privacy and sensitivity; data collection and retention  practices; the use of open standards for information  exchange; de-identifcation and anonymization;  and guidance on how an organization can establish,  participate in, and maintain coordination and  information-sharing relationships. The guidance will  help incident responders, network defenders, and  operations personnel consider what information is  sharable, the circumstances under which sharing is  allowed, with whom the information may be shared,  and how the information should be protected.  In October 2016, CSD published SP 800-150, Guide  to Cyber Threat Information Sharing. This publication  helps organizations prepare for an exchange of  cyber threat information, both consuming cyber  threat information from external sources and  producing information for other organizations to  use. Organizations may have diferent capabilities for  detecting threats, responding to attacks, diagnosing  causes, and handling sensitive incident-related  information, but this guidance is intended to help  organizations collaborate and exchange cyber threat  information despite these organizational diferences.  91  https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800-125a/draft https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800-125a/draft mailto:mouli@nist.gov  ITL CYBERSECURITY PROGRAM AND PROJECTS  |  FY 2017  In May 2017, NIST conducted a Threat Intelligence  Working Session as part of the Cybersecurity  Framework Workshop. The working session provided  an opportunity for attendees to provide comments on  the use of cyber threat intelligence in the Framework,  to help shape future enhancements to the Framework,  and to share experiences regarding the use of cyber  threat intelligence in the Framework. NIST used the  feedback received during the workshop and the  public review process as input when updating the  Cybersecurity Framework Version 1.1 and its roadmap.  Throughout the year, CSD engaged with  government, industry, and academia to research  protocols, data models, and standards that enable  cyber threat information sharing and support near  real-time cybersecurity decision-making and security  operations.  In FY 2018, CSD plans to continue to conduct  research, prepare guidance, and take part in  standards development activities that foster greater  interoperability and increase the operational tempo  through near real-time cyber threat information  sharing, including:  • Expressing cyber threat information using  machine-readable formats,  • Developing automated mechanisms for  exchanging cyber threat information,  • Describing automated courses of action,  • Publishing cyber threat information metadata,  and  • Safeguarding cyber threat information.  NIST will also help foster cyber threat information  sharing by supporting information-sharing initiatives  by public and private-sector organizations, including:  • Information Sharing and Analysis Centers  (ISACs),  • Information Sharing and Analysis  Organizations (ISAOs),  • Federal/State/Local agencies,  • Law Enforcement,  • Fusion Centers, and  • Sector Coordinating Councils.

Recently, CSD began  researching general authentication features. This  investigation was prompted by the general call to  move away from passwords toward the growing  number of alternative authentication methods (e.g.,  biometrics, smart cards, etc.). A notional ontology  of authentication is in development that includes a  detailed taxonomy and an assessment approach to  aid in defnitively comparing alternatives.  As the research matures, it is possible to draft  a concept map (see Figure 33) to highlight key  components. There are many intertwining aspects of  authentication, such as the relationships with Identity  Management and Authorization. As more of the  aspects of authentication are identifed and defned,  better development and use of authentication is  expected.  The structure of the authentication taxonomy  (see Figure 34) to encapsulate current and emerging  mechanisms continues to be refned as recent updates  expand the diversity of mechanisms. The taxonomy  includes entity authentication as a wide assortment of  commonly used human-machine, machine-machine,  and human-human methods, all of which are termed  confrmation. Attestation is the term used for afrming  expectations of objects.  92  mailto:christopher.johnson@nist.gov mailto:lee.badger@nist.gov mailto:david.waltermire@nist.gov  NIST/ITL CYBERSECURITY PROGRAM ANNUAL REPORT 2017  - -.. -.., .... -~.  -  �Hi\\1111:�  �ii+  �HH-  • - ...  • - -  �&M+ �lib-  Authentication  Taxonomy  Figure 33: Draft Authentication Concept Map  The notional authentication ontology attempts may overlap or impact the others.

The assessment framework system. To state the issue another way, there appears  separates attributes into security, usability, to be a relation between how much we must ask of the  deployability, and manageability categories (see operator and how willing the operator is to support  Figure 35). It is important to note that each category security rather than (mis)manage it.  Figure 34: Draft Authentication Taxonomy 93  ITL CYBERSECURITY PROGRAM AND PROJECTS  |  FY 2017  Deployability  Usability Manageability  Figure 35: Suitability Framework for Authentication  Specifc methods of assessment in these  categories are not developed and are expected to  be unique to each authentication mechanism and  dependent on the environment. The assessment  framework also includes integration with the  programmatic categories of deployability and  manageability. What is known is that these are unlikely  to be reduced to a single value, but will have to be  assessed across several independent constructs.  Future programmatic eforts will be focused  toward a NISTIR to describe the research results,  encourage further discussion with the community,  and provide recommendations for future standards  development eforts. The goal is to move toward  specifying independent strength requirements  rather than specifc implementation requirements.  Upon completion of the NISTIR, work will begin on a  suitability matrix that will aid the user in determining  how best to apply and assess the assessment  framework. Concerns as to the adoptability of  this approach will be addressed. Additional work  to identify interdependencies among identity  management and authorization controls and  requirements should aid in unifying the approach. As  a clear assessment approach is defned, future identity  management, authentication, and authorization  process implementations can address vulnerabilities  of individual or combined solutions.

For  example, Veteran Afairs’ hospital systems are often  required to meet FISMA, Payment Card Industry (PCI)  and Health Insurance Portability and Accountability  Act (HIPAA) requirements simultaneously. Assessing  and maintaining the security posture of such complex  information systems through manual procedures  leveraging paper-driven approaches is colossal,  inefcient, and often unreliable.  NIST is researching methodologies for enhancing  the security assessment and the near-real-time  monitoring of complex systems. The team is leveraging  cognitive approaches to provide continuous feedback  by highlighting relevant threats, rendering security  enhancements, or augmenting solutions to maintain/  increase systems’ security postures.  During FY 2017, NIST completed a feasibility  assessment and created the project’s research plan,  identifying milestones and deliverables. In FY 2018  and subsequent years, the team will continue the  Cognitive-based Approach to Security Controls  Assessment (CASSA) by researching methods to:  • Identify the relationships between  implemented security and privacy controls for  a targeted information system;  • Analyze the implementation of the security  and privacy controls, providing, as feedback,  a rendered set of suggestions to enhance the  security posture of the system;  • Identify documented and undocumented  vulnerabilities relevant to the system;  • Identify the minimum-resistance penetration  path into the system, providing, as feedback,  rendered recommendations for mitigating the  risk; and  94  mailto:kim.schaffer@nist.gov  NIST/ITL CYBERSECURITY PROGRAM ANNUAL REPORT 2017  • Perform continuous monitoring and analysis  of the system, factoring in the above steps  while providing rendered suggestions for  system enhancements.

OSCAL is attempting to address a number of  challenges around security controls and security  controls assessment. The core challenge, and one  of the primary reasons for creating OSCAL, is that  concepts like security controls and profles are  represented today largely in proprietary ways. In  many cases they are written in prose documents that  are imprecise, lead to diferences in interpretation,  and are not machine-readable, meaning that the  prose instructions require someone to do data entry  into a tool in order for the tool to use the information.  Organizations are also struggling with information  systems that have many diferent components, and  some components require the use of diferent profles  per component, which is commonly the case with  cloud environments. Also, the cloud environments  can be multitenant or have mixed ownership of  components. We need to be able to assess the security  of these systems against a number of requirements,  owners, etc.—to do this simultaneously and provide  these views to stakeholders.  In addition, there are situations where a single  system needs to support multiple regulatory  frameworks. For example, the U.S. Department of  Veterans Afairs is a federal agency (with Federal  Information Security Modernization Act (FISMA)  and NIST Cybersecurity Framework requirements)  and a healthcare institution (with Health Insurance  Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)  requirements) that has credit card transactions  (with requirements specifed in the Payment Card  Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS)). There is  no shortage of requirements for some organizations  that have multiple regulatory frameworks. Assessing  a plethora of security controls rooted on diferent  standards with diferent formatting is a complex  process that is currently largely manual or leverages  proprietary, specifcally customized approaches and  tools.  OSCAL attempts to standardize how  security controls are represented, how a control  implementation for a given system is represented,  and how that information is best used. It supports  the generation of standardized reports that can be  used by both humans and machines. That means  that formats are needed that can be generated by  machines for communicating with other machines,  but can also be easily reformatted so that humans  can read the information. By standardizing the  representation of this information, OSCAL information  can be interoperable because of a well-defned  specifcation with information that’s going to be used,  imported, and subsquently used for security control  assessments. The goal is to keep OSCAL as simple as  possible and provide extensive automation for tools  it uses.  During FY 2017, NIST focused on developing  the control catalog schema and the profle schema,  focusing on addressing a large number of user stories  that describe features, attributes or characteristics.  The team validated the approach with use cases from  SP 800-53 Rev. 4, SP 800-53 Rev. 5 (draft), ISO/IEC  27001 and 27002, and COBIT 5.  In the next year, NIST will continue the  development of the other schemas pertaining to the  project (e.g., the framework schema, implementation  schema and System Security Plan (SSP) representation,  assessment schema, etc.).

The NCCoE’s collaborations  focus on providing practical guidance to technical,  real-world cybersecurity challenges using standards- based, commercially available technologies.  Project Lifecycle  To help accelerate businesses’ adoption of  standards-based, secure technologies, the NCCoE  works collaboratively with stakeholders to:  • Defne and articulate: The NCCoE works  with industry stakeholders, cybersecurity  professionals, academic experts, government  agencies, and others to identify and defne  pressing cybersecurity issues.  • Organize and engage: The NCCoE then  collaborates with stakeholders to refne a  project’s scope and develop detailed technical  descriptions of the problem. The NCCoE also  engages technology vendors via an open  call through the Federal Register, to build a  potential example solution.  • Implement and test: The NCCoE works with  technology vendors that have standards- based, commercially available products  that can be used as part of the example  implementation. These vendors sign a  Cooperative Research and Development  Agreement (CRADA) and help build a  reference design, identify gaps in the build;  and refne the example implementation  until there is a practical, usable, repeatable  reference design that addresses the business  problem.  • Publish and transfer: The NCCoE provides  details of the reference design, standards  mapping, lab implementation, and more  in a NIST SP 1800 series, a three-volume  document that provides applicable guidance  for executives, CISOs or IT directors, and IT  staf.  Types of Collaborators & Partnerships  Vendors, industry stakeholders, academic experts  and others participate in the center through a variety  of collaborative mechanisms as described below:  • Communities of Interest: A Community of  Interest (COI) is a group of professionals and  advisors that share business insights, technical  expertise, challenges, and perspectives to  guide NCCoE projects. The NCCoE relies on  this robust collaboration with experts and  innovators to provide real-world cybersecurity  challenges and inform the reference  designs for standards-based cybersecurity  integrations that address business needs.  • Technology Collaborators: Vendors  who would like to participate in a center  project reply to a Federal Register call for  participation. Vendors who are chosen to  participate sign a CRADA and contribute  their expertise, hardware, or software to the  reference design for a specifc problem.  • National Cybersecurity Excellence  Partnership (NCEP): The NCCoE also works  with technology vendors via the NCEP  program, wherein vendors sign MOUs to  establish a deeper partnership with the  NCCoE. NCEPs can provide hardware,  software, knowledge, personnel, and can  designate guest researchers to work at the  center in person or remotely. The NCCoE  currently has 31 NCEPs, from Fortune  50 market leaders to smaller companies  specializing in IT security.  For more information on NCCoE Partnerships, see  https://nccoe.nist.gov/partners.  SP 1800 Series: Practical Cybersecurity  Guidance  NCCoE projects result in a NIST Special Publication  (SP) 1800 document – a three-volume practice guide,  which is a complement to NIST’s SP 800 series 96  https://nccoe.nist.gov/partners  NIST/ITL CYBERSECURITY PROGRAM ANNUAL REPORT 2017  documents. SP 1800 documents contain an Executive  Summary for business executives, a second volume  for security program managers that details security  approaches and maps security capabilities to the NIST  Cybersecurity Framework as well as other relevant  standards, and a third volume for the cybersecurity  implementation staf that details the steps needed  for another entity to recreate the NCCoE’s example  solution.  In FY 2017, the center published seven practice  guides (up from two in FY 2016 and three in FY 2015)  that provide practical guidance, including a reference  design and implementation details, on standards- based secure technologies:  1.

Example: Impact of Guidance on Wireless Infusion  Pumps  Medical devices like infusion pumps were once  standalone instruments. Today, infusion pumps  connect wirelessly to a variety of healthcare systems,  networks, and other devices. Connecting infusion  pumps to point-of-care medication systems and  electronic health records can improve healthcare  delivery processes, but it also increases cybersecurity  risks that could afect operations or safety. Tampering  with the wireless infusion pump ecosystem, whether  intentionally or otherwise, can expose a healthcare  delivery organization to serious risks, including  breaches of protected health information, loss or  disruption of healthcare services, damage to an  organization’s reputation, productivity, and revenue,  or even loss of life.  The NCCoE worked with a community-of-interest  made up of various components of the healthcare  ecosystem to defne the challenge of using wireless  infusion pumps securely, identify relevant standards  and best practices, and create a representative  architecture.  The NCCoE then developed a lab implementation  to demonstrate how healthcare delivery organizations  can use standards-based, commercially available  cybersecurity technologies and industry best  practices. Working with fve major infusion pump  manufacturers, which accounted for 85 % of the  market in America, and innovative cybersecurity  technology vendors, the NCCoE helped highlight  where security capabilities could be built into the  pumps to strengthen the cybersecurity of the devices,  pump ecosystem, and healthcare enterprise. This has  led to multiple pump manufacturers incorporating  security capabilities into the next generation versions  of their pumps.  Collaborating Across Government  The NCCoE’s Work for Others (WFO) Program,  governed by the NCCoE’s Program Management  Ofce (PMO), facilitates the engagement of other  agencies with NIST’s National Cybersecurity Federally  Funded Research and Development Center (FFRDC).  Since 2015, the WFO program has continuously grown  and currently has several interagency agreements  in place, which support projects for the U.S. Coast  Guard, the U.S. Department of Transportation, the U.S.  Air Force, and the Department of Homeland Security.  Example of Government Collaboration: U.S. Coast  Guard and Sector CSF Profles  In early FY 2017, the U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) and  industry representatives worked with NIST to develop  the Maritime Bulk Liquids Transfer Cybersecurity  Framework (CSF) Profle. This profle template helps  organizations in the complex and sophisticated supply  chain of the oil and natural gas industry assess and  monitor their cybersecurity risk (see https://www.dco.  97  https://www.dco.uscg.mil/Portals/9/CG-FAC/Documents/Maritime_BLT_CSF.pdf?ver=2017-07-19-070544-223 https://nccoe.nist.gov/projects  ITL CYBERSECURITY PROGRAM AND PROJECTS  |  FY 2017  uscg.mil/Portals/9/CG-FAC/Documents/Maritime_  BLT_CSF.pdf?ver=2017-07-19-070544-223). Building  on the success of this CSF profle, the USCG asked for  two more profles to be completed: Mobile Of-Shore  Drilling Units and Passenger Vessels.  The goal of these profles is to provide maritime  sub-sectors with guidance for applying the CSF,  leveraging the framework to create a sub-sector  profle that individual companies can tailor and use to  prioritize resources and identify cybersecurity gaps.  This project has helped showcase how the NCCoE  can apply standards and best practices to real-world  industry challenges to help companies more easily  take advantage of existing guidance.  Workshops & Events  Figure 36: The Enhancing Resilience of the Internet  and Communications Ecosystem Workshop  Throughout FY 2017, the NCCoE hosted and  participated in numerous workshops to defne, refne,  and provide guidance on technical cybersecurity  challenges facing businesses today.  For example, the NCCoE hosted NIST’s Workshop  on “Enhancing Resilience of the Internet and  Communications Ecosystem,” which brought together  over a hundred cybersecurity technologists, vendors,  researchers, and subject matter experts. Executive  Order 13800, “Strengthening the Cybersecurity of  Federal Networks and Critical Infrastructure,” required  the Secretaries of Commerce and Homeland Security  to “jointly lead an open and transparent process  to identify and promote action by appropriate  stakeholders to improve the resilience of the internet  and communications ecosystem and to encourage  collaboration with the goal of dramatically reducing  threats perpetrated by automated and distributed  attacks (e.g., botnets).” The workshop was designed  to allow stakeholders to explore a range of current  and emerging solutions addressing automated,  distributed threats in an open and transparent  manner. The workshop’s proceedings were detailed  in NISTIR 8192, published in FY 2017 (see https://csrc.  nist.gov/publications/detail/nistir/8192/fnal). Beyond  NISTIR 8192, the workshop led to the launch of two  new NCCoE projects: Mitigating IoT Based Automated  Distributed Threats and TLS Server Certifcate  Management.  Additionally, the regularly held NCCoE Speaker  Series showcases thought leaders that highlight  critical cybersecurity issues of national importance  across various industries. The Speaker Series is  jointly hosted by the NCCoE, Maryland Department  of Commerce, and Montgomery County Department  of Economic Development in collaboration with the  Maryland Tech Council. This year, the NCCoE hosted  four Speaker Series events, whose topics ranged from  how small businesses can utilize the NIST CSF, to  cybersecurity threats in the hospitality sector, to the  psychology behind insider threats.  The NCCoE also hosted multiple in-person  workshops with its NCEP partners – in February  at the RSA Conference and in September at  Juniper Networks’ headquarters in Sunnyvale, CA.  The workshops brought together dozens of top  cybersecurity experts from nearly all the partner  organizations to discuss critical cybersecurity  challenges, from identity to artifcial intelligence, that  may beneft from NCCoE guidance.  Learn more about the NCCoE’s events at https://  nccoe.nist.gov/events.  Looking Ahead  Building on the robust stakeholder engagement  seen in FY 2017, the NCCoE expects to accelerate the  number of projects undertaken in FY 2018, reinforcing  the importance of the Healthcare, Financial Services,  and Energy industries as well as expanding work in  identity and access management, the Internet of  Things, and Internet infrastructure. 98  https://www.dco.uscg.mil/Portals/9/CG-FAC/Documents/Maritime_BLT_CSF.pdf?ver=2017-07-19-070544-223 https://www.dco.uscg.mil/Portals/9/CG-FAC/Documents/Maritime_BLT_CSF.pdf?ver=2017-07-19-070544-223 https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/nistir/8192/final https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/nistir/8192/final  NIST/ITL CYBERSECURITY PROGRAM ANNUAL REPORT 2017  ROUTER SECURITY  Legitimate BGPt  Route to  Enterprise A Data Traffic to Enterprise A ---­ HJacked to Attacker 's Network  Forged BGP  Route to  ' Enterprise A  . •- ' •- - ' :, . ............

The research focuses on the development  of measurement and modeling techniques necessary  to understand, predict, and control the behavior of  Internet-scale networked information systems. The  ITL staf use these techniques to guide the design,  analysis, and standardization of new technologies  aimed at improving the robustness of the Internet’s  core infrastructure. Recent eforts have focused on  enhancing the security of several of the foundational  routing and communications protocols - the Internet’s  Domain Name System (DNS), Border Gateway  Protocol (BGP), and Electronic mail (Email) and  messaging infrastructures. In addition, the IIP  program addresses other systemic vulnerabilities in  core Internet technologies such as those that enable  massive scale Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS)  attacks.  The Robust Inter-Domain Routing (RIDR) project  aims to remedy serious security and robustness  vulnerabilities in the Internet’s global BGP routing  system.

BGPsec provides the ability  to use digital signatures to prevent both malicious  and accidental unauthorized routing messages from  efecting Internet global routing operations.  In addition to standards development, NIST  developed and released an open source reference  implementation of emerging IETF BGPsec  specifcations, on-line test tools to foster their adoption  and measurement systems to track their operational  deployment. Figure 37 is a visualization generated by  one such monitoring tool that shows the current state  of Route Origin Authorizations (ROAs) in the global  Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI). The RPKI  has been designed to provide the trust infrastructure  upon which Internet routing security technologies can  be based.  In FY 2017, as BGPsec and RPKI technology  specifcations and implementations matured, ITL  shifted its eforts to focus on technology transition  and operational issues associated with the new  secure routing technologies. The ITL staf and its  collaborators published research results on high- speed BGPsec implementations that attempt to  minimize the operational performance impact of  routing security.

These IT environments are under constant threat of  attack and are frequently undergoing change, with  new and updated software being deployed along  with updated confgurations. The wide variety of  computing products, the dynamic nature of software,  the speed of confguration change, and the diversity  of threats require organizations to maintain situational  awareness over their IT assets and to utilize this  information to make informed risk-based decisions.  Security automation utilizes standardized data  formats and transport protocols to enable data to  be exchanged between business, operational, and  security systems that support security processes by:  • Identifying IT assets, including hardware,  software, and data;  • Providing awareness over the operational  state of computing devices;  • Enabling security reference data to be  collected from internal and external sources;  and  • Supporting analysis processes that measure  the efectiveness of security controls and  provide visibility into security risks, enabling  risk-based decision making.  Commercial solutions built using security  automation specifcations enable the collection and  harmonization of vast amounts of operational and  security data into coherent, comparable information  streams to achieve situational awareness that allows  the timely and active management of diverse IT  systems. Through the creation of reference data  and guidance and the international recognition of  fexible, open standards, the NIST security automation  program works to improve the interoperability, broad  acceptance, and adoption of security automation  solutions to address current and future security  challenges, creating opportunities for innovation.  Specifcation, Standards, and  Guidance Development  To support the overarching security automation  vision, it is necessary to have specifcations that  describe the required interactions between systems,  standards that document international consensus  approaches, and guidance for product developers and  implementers. Through close work with partners in  government, industry, and academia, CSD continues  to facilitate the defnition and development of security  automation approaches that enable organizations to  understand and manage IT security risks.  During FY 2017, CSD has continued to build on  previous security automation work, as follows:  • Identifed and addressed gaps in the current  specifcations;  • Evolved existing approaches to achieve  greater scalability and impact;  • Participated in working groups in standards  development organizations to promote  international consensus around standardized  approaches;  • Provided additional guidance on architectural,  design, and analysis concerns; and  • Developed and maintained tools and reference  implementations.  CSD is currently working with its partners in various  standards-development organizations, including  ISO, IETF, the Organization for the Advancement  of Structured Information Standards (OASIS), the  Forum of Incident Response and Security Teams  (FIRST), and the Trusted Computing Group (TCG), to  further mature and broaden the adoption of security  automation specifcations, reference data, and  techniques. This area of work is focused on evolving  security automation specifcations to integrate with  existing transport protocols to provide for the secure,  interoperable exchange of security automation data.  Additional work is focused on evolving security 102  NIST/ITL CYBERSECURITY PROGRAM ANNUAL REPORT 2017  metrics and providing consensus guidance on security  automation approaches. Through the defnition  and adoption of security automation standards  and guidelines, IT vendors will be able to provide  standardized security solutions to their customers.  These solutions support continuous monitoring and  automated, dynamic network defense capabilities,  based on the analysis of data from operational and  security data sources and the collective action of  security components.  Additionally, CSD is working with the vulnerability  community to enable the automated analysis of  metrics such as the Common Vulnerability Scoring  System (CVSS), establishing a baseline of the  minimum information needed to properly inform the  vulnerability management process, and facilitating the  sharing of vulnerability information across language  barriers. To assist in this work, a public draft of NISTIR  8138, Vulnerability Description Ontology (VDO): A  Framework for Characterizing Vulnerabilities, was  created to foster a conversation and collect feedback  on the best mechanisms to improve the degree  of automation within vulnerability management  processes. CSD is planning to develop this document  iteratively by releasing additional drafts in FY 2018 to  ensure participation from as many stakeholders in the  vulnerability community as possible.  Security automation standardization work has  been focused in three areas: the evolution and  international adoption of the Security Content  Automation Protocol (SCAP), the development of  software asset management standards to support  operational and cybersecurity use cases, and the  development of security automation consensus  standards. The following sections detail this work.  Security Content Automation  Protocol (SCAP)  SCAP is a multipurpose protocol that provides  an automated means to collect and assess the state  of devices. SCAP supports automated vulnerability  checking, verifying the installation of patches,  checking security confguration settings, verifying  technical-control compliance, measuring security, and  examining systems for indicators of a compromise.  SCAP uses the Extensible Markup Language (XML) to  standardize the format and nomenclature by which  security software products communicate information  about software faws, security confgurations, and  other aspects of the device state. SCAP enables  security automation content, also known as “SCAP  content,” to be expressed using standardized  formats, identifers, and scoring models. This content  can be used by any tool that is conformant to the  specifcations to collect and evaluate the state of  software installed on a device.  Credit: Shutterstock/Den Rise  SCAP has been widely adopted by major  software and hardware manufacturers and has  become a signifcant component of information  security management and governance programs.  SCAP-enabled tools are currently being used by the  U.S. Government, critical infrastructure companies,  academia, and other businesses, both domestically  and internationally. Currently, CSD is leveraging  SCAP in multiple areas, both to support its own  mission and to enable other agencies and private- sector entities to meet their goals. For CSD, SCAP is  a critical component of the SCAP Validation Program,  the National Vulnerability Database (NVD), and the  National Checklist Program (NCP).  In September 2012, CSD published SP 800-126  Revision 2, The Technical Specifcation for the Security  Content Automation Protocol (SCAP): SCAP Version  1.2. That document describes the 11 component  specifcations composing SCAP. See Table 3 for details.  Since the release of SCAP 1.2, CSD has worked  to improve guidance for using SCAP specifcations.  In FY 2015, CSD released draft NISTIR 8058, Security  103  ITL CYBERSECURITY PROGRAM AND PROJECTS  |  FY 2017  Content Automation Protocol (SCAP) Version 1.2  Content Style Guide: Best Practices for Creating  and Maintaining SCAP 1.2 Content, which provides  guidance for SCAP 1.2 content creators to ensure that  stylistic variations in SCAP 1.2 content are addressed  in a way that improves the accuracy and consistency  of results, avoids performance problems, reduces  user efort, lowers content maintenance burdens, and  enables content reuse. To achieve this, NISTIR 8058  documents best practices for content creation and  encourages their use by SCAP content authors and  maintainers. Feedback on this document is welcomed  and will help CSD to work toward producing a fnal  version of this NISTIR 8058.  Credit: Shutterstock/Titima Ongkantong  CSD is actively working on an SCAP 1.3 revision. In  July 2016, CSD posted drafts for public comment of  SP 800-126 Revision 3 and SP 800-126A. SP 800-126  Revision 3, is The Technical Specifcation for the Security  Content Automation Protocol (SCAP): SCAP Version  1.3. SP 800-126A is SCAP 1.3 Component Specifcation  Version Updates: An Annex to NIST Special Publication  800-126 Revision 3. These publications collectively  document the draft requirements for SCAP 1.3. SP  800-126A is a new publication that allows SCAP 1.3 to  take advantage of selected minor version updates of  SCAP component specifcations, as well as designated  Open Vulnerability and Assessment Language (OVAL)  platform schema revisions. The SCAP 1.3 revision  includes the following changes:  • Adoption of the Open Vulnerability and  Assessment Language (OVAL) 5.11.1, which  was released in April 2015;  • Adoption of the Common Vulnerability  Scoring System (CVSS) v3, which was  released in June 2015;  • Removal of support for CVSSv2; and  • Deprecation of support for older specifcation  revisions and SCAP 1.0.  CSD is currently working to publish the fnal  versions of the publications described above in  early FY 2018. CSD has published a beta release of  an updated version of SCAPVal, the SCAP content  validation tool. A fnal version of this tool will be  provided after the SP 800-126 documents have been  fnalized. CSD is also working to update the SCAP  Validation Program to support SCAP 1.3, with an  update to NISTIR 5711 to be posted in early FY 2018.  More information on SCAP 1.3 can be found at: https://  csrc.nist.gov/Projects/Security-Content-Automation- Protocol/SCAP-Releases/SCAP-1-3.  CSD is also starting to plan an SCAP 2.0 release  (SCAP v2). This release will further defne the  interfaces and use of transport protocols for SCAP  tools to provide component-level interoperability  between products supporting various SCAP  functions. By providing more interoperability, SCAP  v2 will provide the basic software and confguration  posture information needed to make and automate  management decisions for networked devices as  part of the license, vulnerability and confguration  management practices, supporting improved  networked device hygiene. Furthermore, the posture  information provided by SCAP v2 products will provide  much of the context needed to prevent, detect, and  respond to network attacks. This additional context  will enable SCAP v2 information to be applied for  application whitelisting, the detection of anomalous  behavior, the gathering and use of indicators, the  use of machine-readable threat information, and for  orchestrating courses of action. CSD is preparing a  draft whitepaper for release in early FY 2018 that will  outline an approach, a development plan identifying  the new and revised specifcations that will be  needed, and a transition plan for moving from SCAP  1.x to SCAP 2.0. A discussion draft of the SCAP 2.0  specifcation addressing software asset management  and vulnerability management use cases will also  be published in FY 2018 as a way to start a broader  conversation with the SCAP community about where  to focus next on the development of SCAP 2.0. 104  https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/Security-Content-Automation-Protocol/SCAP-Releases/SCAP-1-3 https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/Security-Content-Automation-Protocol/SCAP-Releases/SCAP-1-3 https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/Security-Content-Automation-Protocol/SCAP-Releases/SCAP-1-3  NIST/ITL CYBERSECURITY PROGRAM ANNUAL REPORT 2017  SPECIFICATIONS DESCRIPTION  Languages  Extensible Confguration Checklist Description  Format (XCCDF) 1.2  Used for authoring security checklists/benchmarks  and for reporting the results of evaluating them  Open Vulnerability and Assessment Language  (OVAL) 5.11.2  Used for representing system-confguration  information, assessing machine state, and reporting  assessment results  Open Checklist Interactive Language (OCIL) 2.0  Used for representing checks that collect information  from people or from existing data stores populated  by other data collection methods  Reporting Formats  Asset Reporting Format (ARF) 1.1  Used to express information about assets and to  defne the relationships between assets and reports  Asset Identifcation 1.1  Used to uniquely identify assets based on known  identifers and other asset information  Identifcation Schemes  Common Platform Enumeration (CPE) 2.3  A nomenclature and dictionary of hardware,  operating systems, and applications; a method to  identify the applicability to platforms  Software Identifcation (SWID) Tags 2015  A structured metadata format for describing a  released software product  Common Confguration Enumeration (CCE) 5  A nomenclature and dictionary of software-security  confgurations  Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE)  A nomenclature and dictionary of security-related  software faws  Measurement and Scoring Systems  Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)  Used for measuring the relative severity of software  faws  Common Confguration Scoring System (CCSS)  Used for measuring the relative severity of device  security (mis-)confguration issues  Content and Result Integrity  Trust Model for Security Automation Data (TMSAD)  Guidance for using digital signatures in a common  trust model applied to security automation  specifcations  TABLE 3: SCAP 1.2 SPECIFICATIONS  105  ITL CYBERSECURITY PROGRAM AND PROJECTS  |  FY 2017  LEGEND  ~ CORPUS  ~ PRIMARY  ~ SUPPLEMENTAL  ~ PATCH  Software Asset Management  Standards  CSD has been collaborating with industry  partners to promote the adoption of ISO/IEC  19770-2:2015, Information technology—Software  asset management—Part 2: Software identifcation  tag, which establishes a specifcation for tagging  software to support identifcation and management.  The software identifcation (SWID) data model  defned by this standard describes an XML format  for software publishers to provide authoritative  identifcation, categorization, software relationships  (e.g., dependency, bundling, and patching),  executable and library footprint details, and other  metadata for software. This information can be used  to support operational and cybersecurity use cases  around managing software deployments, managing  software licenses, managing software vulnerabilities  and related software patches, and assessing secure  software confgurations.  To supplement the requirements in ISO/IEC  19770-2:2015, CSD collaborated with DHS, NSA,  and MITRE on the development of NISTIR 8060,  Guidelines for the Creation of Interoperable Software  Identifcation (SWID) Tags. NISTIR 8060, published in  April 2016, provides an overview of the capabilities  and usage of SWID tags as part of a comprehensive  software lifecycle. This report introduces SWID  tags in an operational context, provides guidelines  for the creation of interoperable SWID tags, and  highlights key usage scenarios for which SWID tags  are applicable. Figure 39 illustrates several types of  SWID tags (as indicated in the legend) and how these  support multiple elements of the software product  life cycle, including deployment, installation, patching,  upgrading and removal.  Figure 39: SWID Tags Support the Software Product Lifecycle  Additionally, in FY 2017, NIST has worked with  the IETF to integrate SWID tags into the Network  Endpoint Assessment (NEA) protocol, through the  Software Inventory Message and Attributes (SWIMA)  for PA-TNC specifcation (see https://datatracker.ietf.  org/doc/draft-ietf-sacm-nea-swima-patnc/). This  draft Request for Comments (RFC) will be published  soon, describing a method for the automated, event-  based collection of software inventory information  using SWID tag information.  The information provided within SWID tags  enhances the SCAP use cases by providing  authoritative information that can be used to create  Common Platform Enumeration (CPE) names, to  support the targeting of checklists, and to associate 106  software faws to products, based on a defect in  https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-sacm-nea-swima-patnc/ https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-sacm-nea-swima-patnc/  NIST/ITL CYBERSECURITY PROGRAM ANNUAL REPORT 2017  a software library or executable. In FY 2017, CSD  published a SWID tag validation tool (see https://  scap.nist.gov/specifcations/swid/), called SWIDVal,  that can validate a SWID tag document against the  ISO/IEC 19770-2:2015 and NISTIR 8060 requirements.  Development of Security Automation  Consensus Standards  CSD has been promoting the broad international  adoption of SCAP by encouraging the integration of  SCAP into other standards, and by adapting SCAP  to address specifc gaps and challenges. CSD has  continued its collaboration with its industry partners  in the IETF Security Automation and Continuous  Monitoring (SACM) working group. This working  group provides a venue for advancing appropriate  SCAP specifcations into international standards and  addressing identifed gap areas. The current scope of  work for SACM includes identifying and/or defning  the transport protocols and data formats needed  to support the collection and evaluation of details  regarding a device’s state against the expected  values. The SACM working group has been working on  identifying use cases, requirements, and architectural  models to provide information to facilitate decisions  about existing specifcations and standards that can  be referenced, required modifcations or extensions  to existing specifcations and standards, and any gaps  that need to be addressed. CSD is working with DHS,  the Center for Internet Security (CIS), and the TCG  to bring existing work into the IETF SACM working  group, including OVAL and specifcations related to  the Trusted Network Connect (TNC) protocol.  For more information, please refer to: http://  datatracker.ietf.org/wg/sacm/charter/.  Also, within the IETF, CSD has been collaborating  with the Managed Incident Lightweight Exchange  (MILE) working group in order to develop the  Resource-Oriented Lightweight Information Exchange  (ROLIE) specifcation. This specifcation seeks  to address the security automation information  discovery and dissemination use cases by defning  how tools are expected to communicate with security  automation information repositories. ROLIE allows for  the transport, retrieval, and storage of any security  automation-relevant information types. The ROLIE  draft has undergone two major revisions, with the  fnal draft nearing completion. In addition, CSD has  begun the process of collaborating with MILE and  other stakeholders to create extension drafts for  ROLIE that address a number of information types,  including vulnerability, confguration checklist, and  software metadata information types.  The main ROLIE draft can be found at https://  datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-mile-rolie/.  Additional information on ROLIE and on the extension  drafts can be found in the working repository on  GitHub: https://github.com/CISecurity/ROLIE/.  CSD also worked with its government and  industry partners in the TCG to defne a number  of specifcations related to the Trusted Network  Connect (TNC) protocol. The frst such publication  is the TNC SCAP Messages for IF-M specifcation  that supports carrying the SCAP content and results  over the TNC protocols. IF-M is a messaging protocol  that helps communicate measurement information  about endpoints for evaluation against security  policy. The second is the TNC Endpoint Compliance  Profle (ECP) and related specifcations that support  the exchange of SWID data over the TNC protocols.  The ECP enables the collection of SWID data from a  device for use by external tools to provide software  inventory information. SCAP and SWID data collected  using these mechanisms may be optionally used for  network access control decision making, allowing the  device state to be evaluated when devices connect  and on an ongoing basis thereafter.  For more information on this specifcation,  please visit: http://www.trustedcomputinggroup.  org/resources/tnc_endpoint_compliance_profle_  specifcation.  Updated versions of the ECP and SWID-related  specifcations, along with a usage scenario around  vulnerability assessment, are currently being worked  on in the SACM and MILE working groups, which are  available through the locations indicated in Table 4.  The SACM and MILE working groups have been  developing the following related Internet Drafts:  107  https://scap.nist.gov/specifications/swid/ https://scap.nist.gov/specifications/swid/ http://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/sacm/charter/ http://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/sacm/charter/ https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-mile-rolie/ https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-mile-rolie/ https://github.com/CISecurity/ROLIE/ http://www.trustedcomputinggroup.org/resources/tnc_endpoint_compliance_profile_specification http://www.trustedcomputinggroup.org/resources/tnc_endpoint_compliance_profile_specification http://www.trustedcomputinggroup.org/resources/tnc_endpoint_compliance_profile_specification  ITL CYBERSECURITY PROGRAM AND PROJECTS  |  FY 2017  INTERNET DRAFT PURPOSE  https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-sacm- coswid/  A Concise Binary Object Representation (CBOR)  [RFC7049] based specifcation for representing  SWID tag for use with constrained IoT devices.  https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-sacm-ecp/  Specifes the Endpoint Compliance Profle (ECP),  that describes the use of IETF and TNC protocols  and interfaces to support the ongoing assessment  of endpoint posture and the controlled exposure of  collected posture information to authorized security  applications.  https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-sacm-nea- swima-patnc/  Extends the PA-TNC specifcation [RFC5792] to  provide specifc attributes and message exchanges  allowing endpoints to report their installed software  inventory information to a NEA server.  https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-mile-rolie/  The ROLIE protocol supporting a resource-oriented  approach for security automation information  publication, discovery, and sharing.  https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-sacm-rolie- softwaredescriptor/  An extension to ROLIE to support the exchange of  SWID-based software information.  https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-sacm- terminology/  Defnition of the common terminology used within  several working-group documents.  Additionally, CSD has several members who are  actively engaged on the CVE Board, which is working  to improve the assignment of CVE identifers for  vulnerabilities, with the overall goal of improving  the automated processing of vulnerabilities and the  timeliness of CVE identifer issuance.  Finally, CSD has worked with FIRST by  participating in two Special Interest Groups (SIGs).  The CVSS SIG (CVSS-SIG) is focused on maintaining  and improving the CVSS scoring model, based on  community feedback. The CVSS-SIG published CVSS  Revision 3 (CVSS v3) in June 2015. The second SIG,  the Vulnerability Reporting and Data eXchange SIG  (VRDX-SIG), researches and recommends methods for  identifying and exchanging vulnerability information  across disparate vulnerability databases.  For more information, please visit: http://www.  frst.org/global/sigs.  Through work with international standards- developing organizations (SDOs), SCAP and its  related security automation capabilities are expected  to evolve and expand in support of the growing need  to defne and measure efective security controls,  assess and monitor ongoing aspects of information  security, remediate noncompliance, and successfully  manage systems in accordance with the Risk  Management Framework described in SP 800-37  Revision 1, Guide for Applying the Risk Management  Framework to Federal Information Systems: A Security  Life Cycle Approach. Standards that are developed  and published by these SDOs will be considered for  inclusion in future revisions of SCAP. 108  http://www.first.org/global/sigs http://www.first.org/global/sigs https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-sacm-coswid/ https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-sacm-coswid/ https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-sacm-rolie-softwaredescriptor/ https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-sacm-rolie-softwaredescriptor/ https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-sacm-terminology/ https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-sacm-terminology/  NIST/ITL CYBERSECURITY PROGRAM ANNUAL REPORT 2017  FOR MORE INFORMATION, SEE:  https://scap.nist.gov/  CONTACT:  Mr. David Waltermire  (301) 975-3390  david.waltermire@nist.gov  Security Automation Reference Data  Through the National Vulnerability Database and  the National Checklist Program (see below), NIST is  providing relevant and important reference data in the  areas of vulnerability and confguration management.  SCAP and the programs that leverage it are moving  the information assurance industry toward being  able to standardize communications and toward the  collection and storage of relevant data in standardized  formats, as well as providing an automated means for  the assessment and remediation of systems for both  vulnerabilities and confguration compliance.  National Vulnerability Database  (NVD)  Security automation reference data is currently  housed within the NVD. The NVD is a comprehensive  cybersecurity vulnerability database that allows  the tracking of vulnerability trends over time. This  trending service allows users to assess changes in  vulnerability discovery rates within specifc products  or within specifc types of vulnerabilities. NVD data  is represented using the SCAP specifcations. The  NVD includes databases of security confguration  checklists for the NCP, listings of publicly known  software faws, product names, and impact metrics. A  formal validation program tests the ability of vendor  products to use some forms of security automation  data, based on a product’s conformance in support of  specifc enterprise capabilities.  SCAP defnes the structure of standardized  software faws and security confguration reference  data, also known as SCAP content. This reference data  is provided by the NVD.  As of the end of September 2017, the NVD  contained the following resources:  • Over 96,000 vulnerability advisories, with an  average of 62 new vulnerabilities added daily;  • 183 SCAP-expressed checklists across 123  platforms containing thousands of low-level  security confguration checks that can be  used by SCAP-validated security products to  perform automated evaluations of the system  state;  • 293 non-SCAP security checklists (e.g., English  prose guidance and confguration scripts);  • 249 U.S. Computer Emergency Readiness  Team (US-CERT) alerts; 4,467 US-CERT  vulnerability summaries; and 10,286 SCAP  machine-readable software faw checks; and  • A product dictionary with over 124,000  operating system, application, and hardware  name entries; and over 75,000 vulnerability  advisories translated into Spanish.  NVD is hosted and maintained by NIST and is  sponsored by the Department of Homeland Security’s  US-CERT.  The use of SCAP data by commercial security  products, deployed in thousands of organizations  worldwide, has extended NVD’s efective reach.  Increasing demand for NVD XML data feeds (i.e.,  mechanisms that provide updated data from data  sources) and SCAP-expressed content from the NVD  website demonstrates an increased adoption of SCAP.  In the past year, the NVD began providing CVSS  base scores following the CVSS v3 specifcation within  the data feeds and completed a major enhancement  to the overall user interface. The NVD has also seen a  signifcant increase (almost three fold) in vulnerabilities  received and analyzed over the previous year. Overall,  the NVD has experienced an average download  growth rate of over 10 % per month.

Vulnerabilities in IT  products are discovered daily, and many ready-to- use exploitation techniques are widely available on  the Internet. Because IT products are often intended  for a wide variety of audiences, restrictive security  confguration controls are usually not enabled by  default. As a result, many out-of-the box IT products  are immediately vulnerable. In addition, identifying  a reasonable set of security settings that achieve  balanced risk management is a complicated, arduous,  and time-consuming task, even for experienced  system administrators.  Credit: Shutterstock/Natali_ Mis  To facilitate the development of security  confguration checklists for IT products and to  make checklists more organized and usable, CSD  established the National Checklist Program (NCP)  in furtherance of its statutory responsibilities under  the Federal Information Security Management Act  (FISMA) of 2002, Public Law 107-347, and also under  the Cybersecurity Research and Development Act,  which mandates that NIST “develop, and revise as  necessary, a checklist setting forth settings and option  selections that minimize the security risks associated  with each computer hardware or software system  that is, or is likely to become, widely used within the  Federal Government.” In February 2008, a revision  of Part 39 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation  (FAR) was published. Paragraph (d) of section 39.101  states, “In acquiring information technology, agencies  shall include the appropriate IT security policies and  requirements, including the use of common security  confgurations available from the NIST website at  https://checklists.nist.gov. Agency contracting ofcers  should consult with the requiring ofcial to ensure  that the appropriate standards are incorporated.”  In Memorandum M-08-22, OMB mandated the  use of SCAP-validated products for the continuous  monitoring of Federal Desktop Core Confguration  (FDCC) compliance. The NCP strives to encourage  and assist federal agencies with these mandates.  The goals of the NCP are to:  • Facilitate the development and sharing of  checklists by providing a formal framework for  checklist developers to submit checklists to  NIST;  • Provide guidance to developers to help  them create standardized, high quality  checklists that conform to common operation  environments;  • Help developers and users by providing  guidelines for making checklists better  documented and more usable;  • Encourage software vendors and other parties  to develop checklists;  • Provide a managed process for the review,  update, and maintenance of checklists;  • Provide an easy-to-use repository of  checklists; and  • Encourage the use of automation technologies  (e.g., SCAP) for checklist application.  At the end of FY 2017, there are a total of 476  checklists posted on the NCP website (see https://  checklists.nist.gov/). Of that total, 183 of the checklists,  addressing 123 platforms, are SCAP-expressed and  can be used with SCAP-validated products.  Organizations can use the checklists obtained  from the NCP website for automated security  confguration patch assessment. The NCP currently  provides metadata and links to the latest operating 110  https://checklists.nist.gov https://checklists.nist.gov/ https://checklists.nist.gov/  NIST/ITL CYBERSECURITY PROGRAM ANNUAL REPORT 2017  systems and applications checklists, including MacOS  10.10, Windows 10, Internet Explorer 11.0, Internet  Explorer 10.0, Ofce 2016, Red Hat Enterprise Linux,  and other products.  To assist users in identifying automated checklist  content, NCP groups these checklists into tiers, from  Tier I to Tier IV. The NCP uses the tiers to rank checklists  according to their automation capability. Tier III and  IV checklists include fully vetted SCAP content that  has successfully demonstrated conformance to the  requirements outlined in SP 800-126. Tier III & IV  checklists are considered production-ready and are  intended for use with SCAP-validated products. Tier  II checklists document the recommended security  settings in a machine-readable format such as the  XCCDF-only (i.e., no OVAL content), proprietary  format, or product-specifc confguration script. Tier  I checklists are prose-based and contain no machine- readable content.  Users can browse the checklists, based on the  checklist tier, IT product, IT product category, or  authority, and through a keyword search that searches  the checklist name and summary for user-specifed  terms. The search results show the detailed checklist  metadata and a link to any SCAP content for the  checklist, as well as links to any supporting resources  associated with the checklist.  To assist checklist developers, the NCP provides  both manual and automated interfaces to facilitate the  submission and maintenance processes. The manual  interface consists of a web application that guides the  submitter through the data entry process to ensure  that all the required information is submitted. The  submission is validated upon review, and a report is  returned to the submitting organization, verifying  either acceptance or rejection, based on the criteria  requirements. For instance, Tier III and Tier IV  checklists require validation using the SCAP Content  Validation Tool (this tool is available for download via  https://scap.nist.gov/).  The NCP is defned in SP 800-70 Revision  3, National Checklist Program for IT Products—  Guidelines for Checklist Users and Developers, which  can be found at https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/  PubsSPs.html.  In 2017, NIST released a draft version of SP 800- 70 Revision 4, which can be viewed at https://csrc.  nist.gov/CSRC/media/Publications/sp/800-70/rev-4/  draft/documents/sp800-70r4-draft.pdf. SP 800-70  Revision 4 will be published as fnal in FY 2018, and  the checklists.nist.gov website will be modifed to  refect the updated document.

The confgurations are based  on a collection of resources, including the existing  NIST macOS confguration guidance, the Defense  Information Systems Agency (DISA) macOS Security  Technical Implementation Guide (STIG), and the  Center for Internet Security (CIS) macOS Security  Benchmark.  The project team researched and tested  approximately 270 settings for macOS 10.12. The  confguration set has been signifcantly reduced due  to changes in the operating system’s features and  default setting values. Among other collected data,  each setting has a designated Common Confguration  Enumeration (CCE) number, which aids in its long- term tracking. Figure 40 illustrates the various  categories that comprise the baselines. Note that  a higher quantity of settings in a category does not  imply greater importance over other categories.  111  https://scap.nist.gov/ https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/PubsSPs.html https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/PubsSPs.html https://csrc.nist.gov/CSRC/media/Publications/sp/800-70/rev-4/draft/documents/sp800-70r4-draft.pdf https://csrc.nist.gov/CSRC/media/Publications/sp/800-70/rev-4/draft/documents/sp800-70r4-draft.pdf https://csrc.nist.gov/CSRC/media/Publications/sp/800-70/rev-4/draft/documents/sp800-70r4-draft.pdf https://checklists.nist.gov/ https://checklists.nist.gov mailto:stephen.quinn@nist.gov  ITL CYBERSECURITY PROGRAM AND PROJECTS  |  FY 2017  Integrity, 5  Loca I Services, 6  Speech,4  Finder, 3  Screen Saver, 6  Updates, 5  Network Services, 21  Built-in A!pplications, 6  Access Control, 5  Authent ication , 22  Firewall, 29  Power Management, 4  SSH,15 I Total: 145  Figure 40: Confguration Categories  The shell scripts that apply the settings to a macOS  10.12 system are organized into three key baselines,  which are appropriate for diferent environments:  • The Standalone baseline describes small,  informal computer installations that are used  for home or business purposes;  • The Managed baseline is appropriate for  centrally managed, networked systems; and  • The Specialized Security-Limited Functionality  (SSLF) baseline is appropriate for systems  where security requirements are more  stringent and where the implementation  of security safeguards is likely to reduce  functionality.  In FY 2017, the fnal version of SP 800-179, Guide to  Securing Apple OS X 10.10 Systems for IT Professionals  was published. This document explains the settings,  their security signifcance, and how to confgure them  for the three baselines described above. The project  team then focused on updating the guide, script  and spreadsheet of settings for Apple macOS 10.12  systems.  In FY 2018, the team plans to:  • Produce an updated guide for macOS 10.12;  • Continue to refne the script and add more  settings to the confguration; and  • Investigate macOS 10.13, “High Sierra.”  FOR MORE INFORMATION, SEE:  https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/apple-os-x-security- confguration  https://github.com/usnistgov/applesec 112  https://github.com/usnistgov/applesec https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/apple-os-x-security  NIST/ITL CYBERSECURITY PROGRAM ANNUAL REPORT 2017  CONTACTS:  Mr. Mark Trapnell  Mr. Lee Badger  (301) 975-4091  (301) 975-3176  mark.trapnell@nist.gov lee.badger@nist.gov  Mr. Murugiah Souppaya  (301) 975-8443  murugiah.souppaya@nist.gov  TECHNICAL SECURITY METRICS  Security Risk Analysis of Enterprise  Networks Using Attack Graphs  The protection of computer networks from  malicious intrusions is critical to the economy and  security of the nation. Vulnerabilities are regularly  discovered in software applications that are exploited  to stage cyber attacks. System administrators need  objective metrics to guide and justify decision  making as they manage the security risk of enterprise  networks. The objective of this research is to develop  a standard model for the security risk analysis of  computer networks. A standard model will enable  an organization to answer questions such as “Are  we more secure now than yesterday?” or “How does  the security of one network confguration compare  with another one?” Also, having a standard model to  measure network security will allow users, vendors,  and researchers to evaluate methodologies and  products for network security in a coherent and  consistent manner.  CSD has approached the challenge of network  security analysis by capturing vulnerability  interdependencies and measuring security, based on  how real attackers have penetrated networks. The  methodology used for security risk analysis is based  on attack graphs. CSD analyzes attack paths through a  network, providing a probabilistic metric of the overall  system risk. Through this metric, trade-ofs between  security costs and security benefts are analyzed.  Computer systems are vulnerable to both known  and zero-day attacks. Enterprises have begun to move  parts of their networks from a traditional infrastructure  into cloud computing environments. Cloud providers  ofer virtual servers that can be rented on demand  by users. This paradigm enables cloud customers to  acquire computing resources with high efciency, low  cost and great fexibility. However, it also introduces  many security problems that need to be solved.  Considered as an emerging branch of forensics  that combine network and systems forensics, cloud  forensics addresses post-incident analysis of systems  with the complexities of distributed processing,  multi-tenancy and virtualization. CSD has developed  a framework that shows what evidence can be used  to reconstruct corresponding attack scenarios in  the cloud, and discusses how this framework can be  applied to automate the forensics analysis in the cloud  with the objective of saving a forensics investigator’s  time.  CSD has also developed a layered graphical model  to analyze the impact of cyber attacks on business  processes and services. The model has three layers:  the upper layer models that the business processes  and their dependencies, the middle layer constructs  attack scenarios using evidences in log fles, and the  lowest layer reconstructs the missing attack steps  using system calls. Based on the graph produced from  the three layers, the model computes a quantitative  impact on the business processes. CSD has developed  a case study that shows the usability of this model  and how it can be applied for both forensics analysis  and for mitigating the impact of cyber attacks on the  enterprise infrastructure.  CSD published two papers  in this area:  1. Identifying Evidence for Cloud Forensics  Analysis, International Federation for  Information Processing (IFIP) International  Conference on Digital Forensics, Orlando, FL,  January 29 - February 1, 2017.  2. Towards Actionable Mission Impact  Assessment in the Context of Cloud  Computing, 31st IFIP WG 11.3 Conference on  Data and Application Security and Privacy,  Philadelphia, July 19-21, 2017.  In FY 2018, CSD plans to develop new techniques  and metrics for Cloud Computing forensics analysis  and mission impact analysis. CSD also plans to publish  the results as a NIST report and as white papers in  conferences and journals. 113  mailto:mark.trapnell@nist.gov mailto:lee.badger@nist.gov mailto:murugiah.souppaya@nist.gov  ITL CYBERSECURITY PROGRAM AND PROJECTS  |  FY 2017  FOR MORE INFORMATION, SEE:  https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/measuring-security- risk-in-enterprise-networks/  CONTACT:  Dr. Anoop Singhal  (301) 975-4432  anoop.singhal@nist.gov  Algorithms for Intrusion  Measurement  The Algorithms for Intrusion Measurement (AIM)  project furthers measurement science in designing  and implementing algorithms to both detect attackers  and limit their ability to intrude into a system. Most  of the work leverages graph theory (the math of dots  and lines) and algorithmic complexity analysis (the  math around fast computation). In performing this  work, the AIM project seeks to enhance the nation’s  ability to defend itself from network-borne attacks.  In FY 2017, the AIM project completed research in  several areas: it proved that an important access control  system is scalable, created novel metrics for defense- in-depth measurement, and identifed an important  intrusion detection approach. More specifcally, the  project team accomplished the following:  • The team proved that the NGAC model is  scalable by providing a fast-linear time,  decision algorithm when existing reference  implementations used slow cubic algorithms.  This enables enterprises to reduce insider  threats by tightly controlling data access  through simultaneous instantiation of multiple  access control policies (the research was  published in the Journal of Wireless Mobile  Networks, Ubiquitous Computing, and  Dependable Applications and the Proceedings  of the 2016 International Workshop on  Managing Insider Security Threats).  • The team created novel metrics to measure  the defense-in-depth posture of network  systems. They proved that the metrics are  extremely difcult to calculate (NP-Hard),  and thus provided efcient and accurate  approximation algorithms (this research  was published in the proceedings of the  Proceedings of the 2nd Annual Industrial  Control System Security Workshop).  • The team discovered that n-gram anomaly  detection (the most successful anomaly  detection method to date) can act primarily  as a signature system. This happens, in a form  we call micro-signatures, when removing  attacks from within test data in order to train  on a clean set of data. This result reveals  a new methodology for hybrid anomaly/  signature detection systems while also calling  into question many past anomaly detection  results (this research was published in the  proceedings of the International Symposium  on Foundations and Practice of Security).  In FY 2018, the AIM project will work on evaluating  the privacy of global Internet trafc, architectures for  cryptocurrencies to limit criminal behavior, secure  methods for transactions involving digital goods, and  how to publish trustworthy random numbers using  blockchains and smart contracts.

A NIST investigation of actual failures  has shown that most failures are triggered by one  or two parameters, and progressively fewer by  three, four, or more parameters (see Figure 41); this  relationship is called the Interaction Rule. These results  have important implications for testing software and  systems. If all faults in a system can be triggered by  a combination of n or fewer parameters, then testing  all n-way combinations of parameters with a practical  number of tests can provide strong fault detection  efciency. These methods are being applied to  software and hardware testing for reliability, safety,  and security. CSD’s focus is on empirical results and  the impact on real-world problems. 114  https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/measuring-security-risk-in-enterprise-networks/ https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/measuring-security-risk-in-enterprise-networks/ mailto:anoop.singhal@nist.gov https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/aim mailto:peter.mell@nist.gov  NIST/ITL CYBERSECURITY PROGRAM ANNUAL REPORT 2017  100  90  80  70  60  50  40  30  20  10  0  Cumulative proportion of faults fort= 1 .. 6  1 -- FDA  -- MySQL  2 -- Browser 3 -- Server 4 ----· DBMS 5 -- NWSec- 6  ----- MySQL2 - · - Apache2 -- oscs -- NeoKylin  Project highlights for FY 2017 include the  development of a mathematical model that closely  replicates the evolution and distribution of t-way  failures found in empirical studies; invited lectures  at conferences and universities; leading the Sixth  International Workshop on Combinatorial Testing,  held in conjunction with the Ninth IEEE International  Conference on Software Testing; the development of  combinatorial test methods specifc to text search, with  a demonstration of their practical application; and the  development of combinatorial test methods specifc  to cryptographic software that discovered previously  unknown faults in AES algorithm implementations.

Many  security and protection mechanisms are currently  rooted in software that, along with all underlying  components, must be trusted and not tampered  with. A vulnerability in any of those components  could compromise the trustworthiness of the security  mechanisms that rely upon those components.  Stronger security assurances may be possible by  grounding security mechanisms in roots of trust.  Figure 42: Layers of Abstraction within a Mobile  Computing Device  Roots of trust are highly reliable and secure  hardware, frmware, and software components that  perform specifc, critical security functions. Because  roots of trust are inherently trusted, they must be  secure by their design. As such, many roots of trust  are implemented in hardware or protected frmware  so that malware cannot tamper with the functions  they provide. Roots of trust provide a frm foundation  from which to build security and trust.  This project aims to encourage the use of roots  of trust in computers to provide stronger security  assurances. A focus area for this work has been  securing frmware. Previous work in this project  described methods to protect boot frmware as part  of the SP 800-147 series, now standardized by ISO/  IEC JTC 1/SC 27, IT Security Techniques, as ISO/IEC  19678:2015, Information Technology – BIOS Protection  Guidelines.  A new efort in FY 2017 built upon that earlier work  focused on boot frmware to research and develop  techniques and guidelines for securing frmware  throughout the platform. Released for public comment  in May 2017, SP 800-193, Platform Resiliency Guidelines,  provides technical guidelines and recommendations  supporting the resiliency of platform frmware and  data against potentially destructive attacks. These  draft guidelines promote resiliency in the platform by  describing security mechanisms for protecting the  platform against unauthorized changes, detecting  unauthorized changes that occur, and secure recovery  from attacks.  These new draft guidelines have been the basis  for discussions with industry, standards organizations,  and consortiums over technologies, standards, and  specifcations that can improve the resiliency of  computer platforms using roots of trust. Based on  these discussions, NIST expects to fnalize SP 800-193  in FY 2018 and continue outreach to stakeholders in  government, industry, and academia to encourage the  development of more secure and reliable systems.

During FY 2017, the team contributed usability  chapters to SP 800-63, Digital Identity Guidelines,  marking the frst time that there were dedicated  usability chapters in this publication.  Phishing Awareness Training and  Evaluation  During FY 2017, the usability team completed  a long-term operational phishing evaluation,  demonstrating the importance of individual user  context in explaining phishing email click decisions;  this collaboration provided the supporting data  necessary to interpret the previously puzzling  variability in click rates observed across prior years of  operational phishing awareness training exercises.  The team performed research regarding attacks  known as phishing, where a sender initiates an email  containing fraudulent information with the intent of  inducing the recipient to reveal sensitive information.  Phishing continues to be an escalating cyber threat  facing organizations of all types and sizes, including  industry, academia, and government. To help combat  the phishing threat, many organizations utilize  phishing awareness training to make employees  and students more aware of phishing threats and  consequences. Phishing awareness training systems  often use software to emulate real-world threats and  thus train people to recognize and avoid falling victim  to phishing attacks. Using this type of embedded  training system, researchers in the usability group  partnered with NIST’s OISM (Ofce of Information  Systems Management) and OSHE (Ofce of Safety  Health and Environment) to complete three phishing  awareness training exercises with corresponding  surveys, culminating a multi-year phishing awareness  evaluation.  With the data developed, usability researchers  have successfully answered both an operational  assessment question, Why are users clicking or not  clicking on phishing links and attachments?, as well  as the larger institution’s trial deployment question,  Why are click rates so variable? In contrast to previous  research that was primarily performed in laboratory  settings, the present work examines 4.5 years of in  situ embedded simulated phishing emails. The results  have provided additional insights into the rationale  that leads some users to become victims of phishing  attacks and malicious software. Given the variety of  phishing premises and user contexts, no amount of  training will consistently reduce click rates to zero,  but the fndings helped better understand the user’s  role in early detection, combined with technological  solutions, and determined that awareness training  and reporting should be fully supported and even  incentivized in the workforce.

After more than  a year of work NIST has released a suite of documents  covering digital identity from initial risk assessment  to deployment of federated identity solutions. The SP  suite has also been reorganized. SP 800-63-3 is the  base document associated with SP 800-63A, 800- 63B, and 800-63C that covers the various components  of a digital identity system.  In 2004, NIST published the initial version  of Special Publication (SP) 800-63, Electronic  Authentication Guideline. Since then, two revisions  have been published, SP 800-63-2 being published  in August 2013. In late 2015, NIST started considering  a signifcant update to SP 800-63-2 in response to  117  https://www.nist.gov/itl mailto:mary.theofanos@nist.gov mailto:kristen.greene@nist.gov mailto:michelle.steves@nist.gov  ITL CYBERSECURITY PROGRAM AND PROJECTS  |  FY 2017  market innovation, evolving federal requirements,  and an advanced threat landscape targeting remote  authentication. As the frst step in revising the  publication, NIST solicited recommendations from  experts (including those in industry, government, and  educational felds) on which sections of the document  needed revision. Usability surfaced in many comments  as always latent in many security considerations.  The usability team was invited to participate in and  contribute to this year-long major revision efort. The  team participated in weekly meetings with the project  team, performed literature reviews, compiled results  from our own usable security research, and wrote  usability chapters in each of the suite of documents in  the new SP 800-63.  Specifcally, for SP 800-63A, Digital Identity  Guidelines: Enrollment and Identity Proofng, the  usability chapter was written to raise implementers’  awareness of usability considerations associated  with enrollment and identity proofng. For SP 800- 63B, Digital  Identity Guidelines: Authentication  and Lifecycle Management, the usability chapter  provides usability considerations and guidance  on authentication, as integrating usability into the  development process can lead to authentication  solutions that are secure and usable while addressing  users’ authentication needs and organizations’  business goals. For SP 800-63C, Digital Identity  Guidelines: Federation and Assertions, the usability  chapter provides considerations and guidance to  understand user perspectives on online identity, trust  and benefts, and user mental models and beliefs in  order to promote good user experience with federated  identity systems.

The primary goal of  the NIST’s Information Technology Laboratory (ITL)  Cybersecurity Program, is to provide standards  and technology that protects information systems  against threats to the confdentiality, integrity, and  availability of information and services. During Fiscal  Year 2016 (FY 2016), the ITL Cybersecurity Program  successfully responded to numerous challenges  and opportunities in fulflling that mission. Through  ITL’s diverse research agenda and engagement in  many national priority initiatives, high-quality, cost- efective security and privacy mechanisms were  developed and applied that improved information  security across the Federal Government and the  greater information security community.

A successful attack on platform frmware  could render a system inoperable, perhaps  permanently or requiring reprogramming by  the original manufacturer, resulting in signifcant  disruptions to users. The technical guidelines in this  document promote resiliency in the platform by  describing security mechanisms for protecting the  platform against unauthorized changes, detecting  unauthorized changes that occur,  and recovery  from attacks rapidly and securely. Implementers,  including Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs)  and component/device suppliers, can use these  guidelines to build stronger security mechanisms  into platforms. System administrators, security  professionals, and users can use this document  to guide procurement strategies and priorities for  future systems.  SP 800-192  Verifcation and Test Methods for Access Control  Policies/Models  June 2017  https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800- 192/fnal  https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-192  Access control systems are among the most  critical of computer security components. Faulty  policies, misconfgurations, or faws in software  implementations can result in serious vulnerabilities.  To formally and precisely capture the security  properties that access control should adhere to,  access control models are usually written, bridging  the gap in abstraction between policies and  mechanisms. Identifying discrepancies between  policy specifcations and their intended function  is crucial because correct implementation and  enforcement of policies by applications is based  on the premise that the policy specifcations are  correct. As a result, policy specifcations represented  by models must undergo rigorous verifcation and  validation through systematic verifcation and  testing to ensure that the policy specifcations  truly encapsulate the desires of the policy authors.  Verifying the conformance of access control policies  and models is a non-trivial and critical task, and one  important aspect of such verifcation is to formally  check the inconsistency and incompleteness of the  model and safety requirements of the policy, because  an access control model and its implementation do  not necessarily explicitly express the policy, which  can also be implicitly embedded by mixing with  direct access constraints or other access control  models.  SP 800-191 (DRAFT)  The NIST Defnition of Fog Computing  August 2017 (public comment period: August 21 –  September 21, 2017)  https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800- 191/draft  Managing the data generated by Internet  of Things (IoT) sensors is one of the biggest  challenges faced when deploying an IoT system.  Traditional cloud-based IoT systems are challenged  by the large scale, heterogeneity, and high latency  witnessed in some cloud ecosystems. One solution  is to decentralize applications, management,  and data analytics into the network itself using a  distributed and federated computing model. This  approach has become known as fog computing.  This document presents a formal defnition of fog  and mist computing and how they relate to cloud- based computing models for IoT. This document  further characterizes important properties and  aspects of fog computing, including service models,  deployment strategies, and provides a baseline of  what fog computing is, and how it may be used.  131  https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800-193/draft https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800-193/draft https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800-192/final https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800-192/final https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-192 https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800-191/draft https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800-191/draft  ITL CYBERSECURITY PUBLICATIONS |  FY 2017  SP 800-190  Application Container Security Guide  September 2017 (also issued as two public drafts  during FY 2017)  https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800- 190/fnal  https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-190  Application container technologies, also  known as containers, are a form of operating  system virtualization combined with application  software packaging.

SP 800-188 (2nd DRAFT)  De-Identifying Government Datasets  December 2016 (public comment period:  December 15-31, 2016)  https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800- 188/draft  De-identifcation is a process that is applied to  a dataset to reduce the risk of linking information  revealed in the dataset to specifc individuals.  Government agencies can use de-identifcation to  reduce the privacy risk associated with collecting,  processing, archiving, distributing or publishing  government data. Previously NIST published NISTIR  8053, De-Identifcation of Personal Information,  which provided a survey of de-identifcation and re- identifcation techniques. This document provides  specifc guidance to government agencies that  wish to use de-identifcation. Before using de- identifcation, agencies should evaluate their goals  in using de-identifcation and the potential risks  that de-identifcation might create. Agencies should  decide upon a de-identifcation release model, such  as publishing de-identifed data, publishing synthetic  data based on identifed data, or providing a query  interface that incorporates de-identifcation of the  identifed data. Agencies can create a Disclosure  Review Board to oversee the process of de- identifcation; they can also adopt a de-identifcation  standard with measurable performance levels.  Several specifc techniques for de-identifcation are  available, including de-identifcation by removing  identifers, transforming quasi-identifers and the  use of formal privacy models. People performing  de-identifcation generally use special-purpose  software tools to perform the data manipulation and  calculate the likely risk of re-identifcation. However,  not all tools that merely mask personal information  provide sufcient functionality for performing  de-identifcation. This document also includes an  extensive list of references, a glossary, and a list  of specifc de-identifcation tools, although the  mention of these tools is only to be used to convey  the range of tools currently available, and is not  intended to imply recommendation or endorsement  by NIST.

SP 800-171 Revision 1  Protecting Controlled Unclassifed Information  in Nonfederal Information Systems and  Organizations  December 2016  https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800- 171/rev-1/fnal  https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-171r1  The protection of Controlled Unclassifed  Information (CUI) while residing in nonfederal  information systems and organizations is of  paramount importance to federal agencies and  can directly impact the ability of the Federal  Government to successfully carry out its designated  missions and business operations. This publication  provides federal agencies with recommended  requirements for protecting the confdentiality  of CUI: (i) when the CUI is resident in nonfederal  information systems and organizations; (ii) when the  information systems where the CUI resides are not  used or operated by contractors of federal agencies  or other organizations on behalf of those agencies;  and (iii) where there are no specifc safeguarding  requirements for protecting the confdentiality of  CUI prescribed by the authorizing law, regulation,  or government-wide policy for the CUI category  or subcategory listed in the CUI Registry. The  requirements apply to all components of nonfederal  information systems and organizations that process,  store, or transmit CUI, or provide security protection  for such components. The CUI requirements are  intended for use by federal agencies in contractual  vehicles or other agreements established between  those agencies and nonfederal organizations.

SP 800-125A (2nd Draft)  Security Recommendations for Hypervisor  Deployment  September 2017 (public comment period:  September 14 – October 6, 2017)  https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800-  135 125a/draft  The Hypervisor is a piece of software that  provides an abstraction of all physical resources  (such as CPU, Memory, Network and Storage) and  thus enables multiple computing stacks (basically  made of an O/S and application programs, and  optionally a middleware in some instances)  called Virtual Machines (VMs) to be run on a  single physical host. In addition, it may have the  functionality to defne a network within the single  physical host (called a virtual network) to enable  communication among the VMs resident on that  host as well as with physical and virtual machines  outside the host. With all this functionality, the  hypervisor has the responsibility to mediate access  to physical resources, provide run-time isolation  among resident VMs and enable a virtual network  that provides security-preserving communication  fow among the VMs and between the VMs and  the external network. To design a hypervisor with  the core functionality described above, there are  architectural options, with each option presenting  a diferent size of Trusted Computing Base (TCB)  and hence, a diferent degree of ease in providing  the required security assurance. Hence, in providing  security recommendations for the hypervisor, two  diferent approaches have been adopted in this  document – one approach based on architectural  options that provide the ease of security assurance  and the second approach based on confguration  choices that form part of its core administrative  functions such as the management of VMs,  hypervisor host, hypervisor software and virtual  networks.

When implemented in  an SP 800-38-series-compliant mode of operation  and in a FIPS 140-2-compliant cryptographic  module, TDEA may be used by federal organizations  to protect sensitive unclassifed data. Protection of  data during transmission or while in storage may  be necessary to maintain the confdentiality and  integrity of the information represented by the data.  This Recommendation defnes the mathematical  steps required to cryptographically protect data  using TDEA and to subsequently process such  protected data. TDEA is made available for use by  federal agencies within the context of a total security  program consisting of physical security procedures,  good information management practices, and  computer system/network access controls.

These guidelines focus  on the authentication of subjects interacting  with government systems over open networks,  establishing that a given claimant is a subscriber  who has been previously authenticated. The result  of the authentication process may be used locally by  the system performing the authentication or may be  asserted elsewhere in a federated identity system.  This document defnes technical requirements for  each of the three authenticator assurance levels.  This publication supersedes corresponding sections  of SP 800-63-2.  SP 800-63C  Digital Identity Guidelines: Federation and  Assertions  June 2017  https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800- 63c/fnal  https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-63c  This document and its companion documents,  SP 800-63, SP 800-63A, and SP 800-63B, provide  technical and procedural guidelines to agencies  for the implementation of federated identity  systems and for assertions used by federations. This  publication supersedes corresponding sections of  SP 800-63-2. These guidelines provide technical  requirements for federal agencies implementing  digital identity services and are not intended to  constrain the development or use of standards  outside of this purpose. This guideline focuses on the  use of federated identity and the use of assertions  to implement identity federations. Federation  allows a given credential service provider to  provide authentication and (optionally) subscriber  attributes to a number of separately-administered  relying parties. Similarly, relying parties may use  more than one credential service provider.

The publication describes how to  develop specialized sets of controls, or overlays  that are tailored for specifc types of missions and  business functions, technologies, environments of  operation, and sector-specifc applications. Finally,  the consolidated catalog of controls addresses  security and privacy from a functionality perspective  (i.e., the strength of functions and mechanisms)  and an assurance perspective (i.e., the measure of  confdence in the security or privacy capability).  Addressing both functionality and assurance  ensures that information technology products and  the information systems that rely on those products  are sufciently trustworthy.  SP 800-37 Revision 2 (Discussion Draft)  Risk Management Framework for Information  Systems and Organizations: A System Life Cycle  Approach for Security and Privacy  September 2017  https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800-37/  rev-2/draft  This publication provides guidelines for  applying the Risk Management Framework (RMF)  to information systems and organizations. The  RMF includes a disciplined, structured, and fexible  process for organizational asset valuation; security  and privacy control selection, implementation, and  assessment; system and control authorizations; and  continuous monitoring. It also includes enterprise- level activities to better prepare organizations  to execute the RMF at the system level. The RMF  promotes the concept of near real-time risk  management and ongoing system authorization  through the implementation of continuous  monitoring processes; provides senior leaders  and executives with the necessary information to  make cost-efective, risk management decisions  about the systems supporting their missions and  business functions; and integrates security and  privacy controls into the system development life  cycle. Applying the RMF tasks enterprise-wide  helps to link essential risk management processes  at the system level to risk management processes  at the organization level. In addition, it establishes  responsibility and accountability for the security  and privacy controls deployed within organizational  systems and inherited by those systems. The RMF  incorporates concepts from the Framework for  Improving Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity  that complements the currently established risk  management processes mandated by the Ofce  of Management and Budget and the Federal  Information Security Modernization Act.  SP 800-12 Revision 1  An Introduction to Information Security  June 2017  https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800-12/  rev-1/fnal  https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-12r1  Organizations rely heavily on the use of  information technology (IT) products and services to  run their day-to-day activities. Ensuring the security  of these products and services is of the utmost  importance for the success of the organization.  This publication introduces the information security  principles that organizations may leverage to  understand the information security needs of their  respective systems.  SP 1800 SERIES – CYBERSECURITY  PRACTICE GUIDES  SP 1800-12 (DRAFT)  Derived Personal Identity Verifcation (PIV)  Credentials  September 2017 (public comment period:  September 29 – November 29, 2017)  https://nccoe.nist.gov/projects/building-blocks/  piv-credentials  Federal Information Processing (FIPS) Standards  Publication 201-2, Personal Identity Verifcation  (PIV) of Federal Employees and Contractors,  establishes a standard for a PIV system based on  secure and reliable forms of identity credentials  that are issued by the Federal Government to its  employees and contractors. These credentials are  intended to authenticate individuals who require  access to federally controlled facilities, information  systems, and applications. 138  https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800-37/rev-2/draft https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800-37/rev-2/draft https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800-12/rev-1/final https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800-12/rev-1/final https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-12r1 https://nccoe.nist.gov/projects/building-blocks/piv-credentials https://nccoe.nist.gov/projects/building-blocks/piv-credentials  NIST/ITL CYBERSECURITY PROGRAM ANNUAL REPORT 2017  In 2005, when FIPS 201 was frst published, logical  access was geared toward traditional computing  devices (i.e., desktop and laptop computers), where  the PIV card provides common authentication  mechanisms through integrated smart card readers  across the Federal Government. With the emergence  of computing devices such as tablets, convertible  computers, and, in particular, mobile devices, the  use of PIV cards has proved challenging. Mobile  devices lack the integrated smart card readers  found in laptop and desktop computers and require  separate card readers attached to devices to provide  authentication services. To extend the value of PIV  systems into mobile devices that do not have PIV  Card readers, NIST developed technical guidelines  on the implementation or lifecycle of identity  credentials that are issued by federal departments  and agencies to individuals who possess and prove  control over a valid PIV card.  These NIST guidelines, published in 2014,  describe Derived PIV Credentials (DPCs), which  leverage the identity proofng and vetting results of  current and valid PIV credentials. To demonstrate  the DPC’s guidelines, the NCCoE at NIST built  a security architecture in its laboratory using  commercial technology to manage the lifecycle of  DPCs, demonstrating the process that enables a PIV  Card holder to establish DPCs in a mobile device  that then can be used to allow the PIV Card holder  to access websites that require PIV authentication.  This project resulted in a freely available NIST  Cybersecurity Practice Guide that demonstrates  how an organization can continue to provide two- factor authentication for users with a mobile device  that leverages the strengths of the PIV standard.  Although this project is primarily aimed at the  federal sector’s needs, it is also relevant to mobile  device users with smart card based credentials in  the private sector.  SP 1800-11 (DRAFT)  Data Integrity: Recovering from Ransomware and  Other Destructive Events  September 2017 (public comment period:  September 6 – November 6, 2017)  https://nccoe.nist.gov/projects/building-blocks/  data-integrity  Businesses face a near-constant threat of  destructive malware, ransomware, malicious insider  activities, and even honest mistakes that can alter  or destroy critical data. These data corruption  events could cause a signifcant loss to a company’s  reputation, business operations, and bottom line.  These types of adverse events that ultimately  impact data integrity can compromise critical  corporate information, including emails, employee  records, fnancial records, and customer data. It is  imperative for organizations to recover quickly from  a data integrity attack and trust the accuracy and  precision of the recovered data. The NCCoE at NIST  built a laboratory environment to explore methods  to efectively recover from a data corruption event  in various Information Technology (IT) enterprise  environments. NCCoE also implemented the  auditing and reporting IT system use to support  incident recovery and investigations. This NIST  Cybersecurity Practice Guide demonstrates how  organizations can implement technologies to take  immediate action following a data corruption  event. The example solution outlined in this  guide encourages the efective monitoring and  detection of data corruption in standard, enterprise  components as well as custom applications and  data composed of open-source and commercially  available components.  SP 1800-9 (DRAFT)  Access Rights Management for the Financial  Services Sector  August 2017 (public comment period: August 31 –  October 31, 2017)  https://nccoe.nist.gov/projects/use-cases/access- rights-management  Managing access to resources (data) is  complicated because internal systems multiply  and acquisitions add to the complexity of an  organization’s IT infrastructure. Identity and access  management (IdAM) is the set of technology,  policies, and processes that are used to manage  access to resources. Access rights management  (ARM) is the subset of those technologies, policies,  and processes that manage the rights of individuals  and systems to access resources (data). In other  words, an ARM system enables a company to  give the right person the right access to the right  resources at the right time.  The goal of this project is to demonstrate an  ARM solution that is a standards-based technical  139  https://nccoe.nist.gov/projects/building-blocks/data-integrity https://nccoe.nist.gov/projects/building-blocks/data-integrity https://nccoe.nist.gov/projects/use-cases/access-rights-management https://nccoe.nist.gov/projects/use-cases/access-rights-management  ITL CYBERSECURITY PUBLICATIONS |  FY 2017  approach to coordinating and automating  updates to and improving the security of the  repositories (directories) that maintain the user  access information across an organization. The  coordination improves cybersecurity by ensuring  that user access information is updated accurately  (according to access policies), including disabling  accounts or revoking access privileges as user  resource access needs change. Cybersecurity  is also improved through better monitoring for  unauthorized changes (e.g., privilege escalation).  The system executes user access changes across the  enterprise according to corporate access policies  quickly, simultaneously, and consistently.  The ARM reference design and example  implementation are described in this NIST  Cybersecurity “Access Rights Management” practice  guide. This project resulted from discussions among  NCCoE staf and members of the fnancial services  sector. This NIST Cybersecurity Practice Guide also  describes our collaborative eforts with technology  providers and fnancial services stakeholders to  address the security challenges of ARM. It provides a  modular, open, end-to-end example implementation  that can be tailored to fnancial services companies  of varying sizes and sophistication. The use case  scenario that provides the underlying impetus for  the functionality presented in the guide is based on  normal day-to-day business operations. Although  the reference solution was demonstrated with a  certain suite of products, the guide does not endorse  these specifc products. Instead, it presents the NIST  Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) core functions  and subcategories, as well as the fnancial industry  guidelines that a company’s security personnel can  use to identify similar standards-based products  that can be integrated quickly and cost-efectively  with a company’s existing tools and infrastructure.  Planning for the deployment of the design gives  an organization the opportunity to review and audit  the access control information in their directories  and get a more global, correlated, disambiguated  view of the user access roles and attributes that are  currently in efect.  SP 1800-8 (DRAFT)  Securing Wireless Infusion Pumps in Healthcare  Delivery Organizations  May 2017 (public comment period: May 8 – July 7,  2017)  https://nccoe.nist.gov/projects/use_cases/  medical_devices  Medical devices, such as infusion pumps, were  once standalone instruments that interacted only  with the patient or medical provider. But today’s  medical devices connect to a variety of health  care systems, networks, and other tools within a  healthcare delivery organization (HDO). Connecting  devices to point-of-care medication systems and  electronic health records can improve healthcare  delivery processes; however, increasing the  connectivity capabilities also creates cybersecurity  risks. Potential threats include unauthorized access  to patient health information, changes to prescribed  drug doses, and interference with a pump’s function.  The NCCoE at NIST analyzed risk factors in  and around the infusion pump ecosystem using a  questionnaire-based risk assessment to develop  an example implementation that demonstrates  how HDOs can use standards-based, commercially  available cybersecurity technologies to better  protect the infusion pump ecosystem, including  patient information and drug library dosing limits.  This practice guide will help HDOs implement  current cybersecurity standards and best practices  to reduce their cybersecurity risk, while maintaining  the performance and usability of wireless infusion  pumps.  SP 1800-7 (DRAFT)  Situational Awareness for Electric Utilities  February 2017 (public comment period: February  16 – April 17, 2017)  https://nccoe.nist.gov/projects/use_cases/  situational_awareness  This NIST Cybersecurity Practice Guide  describes our collaborative eforts with technology  providers and energy-sector stakeholders to address  the security challenges that energy providers  face in deploying a comprehensive situational  awareness capability. It ofers a technical approach  to meeting the challenge, and also incorporates  a business-value mind-set by identifying the  strategic considerations involved in implementing  new technologies. The guide provides a modular,  140  https://nccoe.nist.gov/projects/use_cases/medical_devices https://nccoe.nist.gov/projects/use_cases/medical_devices https://nccoe.nist.gov/projects/use_cases/situational_awareness https://nccoe.nist.gov/projects/use_cases/situational_awareness  NIST/ITL CYBERSECURITY PROGRAM ANNUAL REPORT 2017  end-to-end example solution that can be tailored  and implemented by energy providers of varying  sizes and sophistication. It shows energy providers  how we met the challenge using open source and  commercially available tools and technologies that  are consistent with cybersecurity standards. The use  case is based on an everyday operational business  scenario that provides the underlying impetus for  the functionality presented in the guide. Test cases  were defned with industry participation to provide  multiple examples of the capabilities necessary to  provide situational awareness.  SP 1800-6 (DRAFT)  Domain Name Systems-Based Electronic Mail  Security  November 2016 (public comment period:  November 2 – December 19, 2016)  https://nccoe.nist.gov/projects/building-blocks/  secured-email  This document proposes a reference guide on  how to architect, install, and confgure a security  platform for trustworthy email exchanges across  organizational boundaries. The project includes  reliable  authentication of mail servers, digitally  signing and encrypting email, and binding  cryptographic key certifcates to sources and  servers. The example solutions and architectures  presented are based upon standards-based and  commercially available products. The example  solutions presented can be used by any organization  implementing Domain Name System-based  electronic mail security.  SP 1800-3 (2nd DRAFT)  Attribute Based Access Control  September 2017 (public comment period:  September 20 – October 20, 2017)  https://nccoe.nist.gov/projects/building-blocks/  attribute-based-access-control  Enterprises rely upon strong access control  mechanisms to ensure that corporate resources  (e.g., applications, networks, systems, and data) are  not exposed to anyone other than an authorized  user. As business requirements change, enterprises  need highly fexible access control mechanisms that  can adapt. The application of attribute based policy  defnitions enables enterprises to accommodate a  diverse set of business cases. This NCCoE practice  guide details a collaborative efort between the  NCCoE and technology providers to demonstrate  a standards-based approach to Attribute Based  Access Control (ABAC). This guide discusses  potential security risks facing organizations,  benefts that may result from the implementation of  an ABAC system, and the approach that the NCCoE  took in developing a reference architecture and  build. It includes a discussion of major architecture  design considerations, an explanation of security  characteristics achieved by the reference design,  and a mapping of the security characteristics to  applicable standards and security control families.  For parties interested in adopting all or part of the  NCCoE reference architecture, this guide includes a  detailed description of the installation, confguration,  and integration of all components.

NISTIR 8179 (DRAFT)  Criticality Analysis Process Model: Prioritizing  Systems and Components  July 2017 (public comment period: July 10 – August  18, 2017)  https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/nistir/8179/  draft  In the modern world where complex systems  and systems-of-systems are integral to the  functioning of society and businesses, it is  increasingly important to be able to understand and  manage risks that these systems and components  may present to the missions that they support.  However, in the world of fnite resources, it is not  possible to apply equal protection to all assets. This  publication describes a comprehensive Criticality  Analysis Process Model – a structured method of  prioritizing programs, systems, and components  based on their importance to the goals of an  organization and the impact that their inadequate  operation or loss may present to those goals. A  criticality analysis can help organizations identify  and better understand the systems, subsystems,  components and subcomponents that are most  essential to their operations and the environment in  which they operate. That understanding facilitates  better decision making related to the management  of an organization’s information assets, including  information security risk management, project  management, acquisition, maintenance, and  upgrade decisions. The Model is structured to  logically follow how organizations design and  implement projects and systems, can be used as  a component of a holistic and comprehensive risk  management approach that considers all risks, and  can be used with a variety of risk management  standards and guidelines.  142  https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/nistir/8192/final https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/nistir/8192/final https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.IR.8192 https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/nistir/8183/final https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/nistir/8183/final https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.IR.8183 https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/nistir/8179/draft https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/nistir/8179/draft  NIST/ITL CYBERSECURITY PROGRAM ANNUAL REPORT 2017  NISTIR 8176 (DRAFT)  Security Assurance Challenges for Container  Deployment  August 2017 (public comment period: August 1-25,  2017)  https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/nistir/8176/  draft  Application containers are slowly being adopted  in enterprise IT infrastructures. Security guidelines  and countermeasures have been proposed to  address the security concerns associated with the  deployment of application container platforms. To  assess the efectiveness of the security solutions  implemented based on these recommendations,  it is necessary to analyze the solutions and outline  the security assurance requirements they must  satisfy to meet their intended objectives. This is  the contribution of this document. The focus is on  application containers on a Linux platform.  NISTIR 8170 (DRAFT)  The Cybersecurity Framework: Implementation  Guidance for Federal Agencies  May 2017 (public comment period: May 12 – June  30, 2017)  https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/nistir/8170/  draft  This publication assists federal agencies in  strengthening their cybersecurity risk management  by helping them to determine an appropriate  implementation of the Framework for Improving  Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity (known as the  Cybersecurity Framework). Federal agencies can  use the Cybersecurity Framework to complement  the existing suite of NIST security and privacy risk  management standards, guidelines, and practices  developed in response to the Federal Information  Security Management Act, as amended (FISMA). The  relationship between the Cybersecurity Framework  and the National Institute of Standards and  Technology (NIST) Risk Management Framework  are discussed in eight use cases.  NISTIR 8165  Impact of Code Complexity on Software Analysis  February 2017  https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/nistir/8165/  fnal  https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/ir/2017/NIST.  IR.8165.pdf  The Software Assurance Metrics and Tool  Evaluation (SAMATE) team studied thousands of  warnings from static analyzers. Tools have difculty  distinguishing between the absence of a weakness  and the presence of a weakness that is buried in  otherwise-irrelevant code elements. This paper  presents classes of these code elements, which we  call “code complexities.”  These code elements have been present in  software assurance testing regimens as part of the  generation strategy for test cases when evaluating  static analyzers. The benefts of using code  complexity include the development of coding  guidelines, boosting the diversifcation of the test  cases.  NISTIR 8151  Dramatically Reducing Software Vulnerabilities:  Report to the White House Ofce of Science and  Technology Policy  November 2016  https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/nistir/8151/  fnal  https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.IR.8151  The call for a dramatic reduction in software  vulnerability is heard from multiple sources, recently  from the February 2016 Federal Cybersecurity  Research and Development Strategic Plan. This  plan starts by describing well-known risks; current  systems perform increasingly vital tasks and are  widely known to possess vulnerabilities. These  vulnerabilities are often not easy to discover and  are difcult to correct. Cybersecurity has not  kept pace, and the pace that is needed is rapidly  accelerating. The goal of this report is to present a  list of specifc technical approaches that have the  potential to make a dramatic diference in reducing  vulnerabilities – by stopping them before they  occur, by fnding them before they are exploited or  by reducing their impact.

SP 800-22 and SP 800-90 (A, B,  and C) discuss tests and methods leveraging both  Shannon and min entropies. Shannon and min  entropies represent two particular cases of Renyi  entropy, which is a more general, one-parameter  entropy model. Renyi entropy insightfully unifes  Hartley, Shannon, collision, and min entropies and  belongs to the class of one parameter entropy  models, such as entropies named after Havrda- Charvat-Daroczy, Tsallis, Abe, and Kaniadakis. Renyi  entropy, along with the other members of the one- parameter entropy models class, can be viewed  as a case of the Sharma-Mittal entropy, which is  a bi-parametric generalized entropy model. This  NISTIR focuses on using Renyi and Tsallis entropy  and divergence models to analyze similarities and  diferences between the probability distributions  of interest. The report introduces extensions  for the traditional uniformity identifcation and  measurement techniques that were proposed in SP  800-22 and SP 800-90.  NISTIR 8136  An Overview of Mobile Application Vetting  Services for Public Safety  January 2017  https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/nistir/8136/  fnal  https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.IR.8136  The Middle Class Tax Relief Act of 2012  mandated the creation of the frst nationwide,  high-speed communications network dedicated  for public safety. The law instantiated a new federal  entity, the Federal Responder Network Authority  (FirstNet), to build, maintain, and operate a new  Long Term Evolution (LTE) network. This network  has the potential to equip frst responders with  a modern array of network devices. Mobile  applications are  an important resource that will be  utilized by this network. However, current mobile  application developers may not be aware of the  unique needs and requirements that must be met  for operation on FirstNet’s network. It would beneft  the public safety community to leverage the mobile  application vetting services and infrastructures  that already exist. These services currently target  the general public and enterprise markets. This  document is intended to be an overview of existing  mobile application vetting services, the features  these services provide and how they relate to  public safety’s needs. It is also meant to aid public  safety organizations when choosing which mobile  application vetting services are used to evaluate  relevant mobile applications.

In recent years,  there has been an increased deployment of small  computing devices that have limited resources with  which to implement cryptography. When current  NIST-approved algorithms can be engineered  to ft into the limited resources of constrained  environments, their performance may not be  acceptable. For these reasons, NIST started a  lightweight cryptography project that was tasked  with learning more about the issues and developing  a strategy for the standardization of lightweight  cryptographic algorithms. This report provides an  overview of the lightweight cryptography project at  NIST, and describes plans for the standardization of  lightweight cryptographic algorithms.

This  publication introduces two key components to  support the application of privacy engineering and  risk management: privacy engineering objectives  and a privacy risk model.  144  https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/nistir/8136/final https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/nistir/8136/final https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.IR.8136 https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/nistir/8114/final https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/nistir/8114/final https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.IR.8114 https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/nistir/8062/final https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/nistir/8062/final https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.IR.8062  NIST/ITL CYBERSECURITY PROGRAM ANNUAL REPORT 2017  NISTIR 8011 Volume 1  Automation Support for Security Control  Assessments: Overview  June 2017  https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/nistir/8011/  vol-1/fnal  https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.IR.8011-1  This volume introduces concepts to support  the automated assessment of most of the security  controls in SP 800-53. Referencing SP 800-53A, the  controls are divided into more granular parts (called  determination statements) to be assessed. The  parts of the control assessed by each determination  statement are called control items. The control items  are then grouped into the appropriate security  capabilities. As suggested by SP 800-53 Revision  4, security capabilities are groups of controls that  support a common purpose. For efective automated  assessment, testable defect checks are defned that  bridge the determination statements to the broader  security capabilities to be achieved and to the SP  800-53 security control items themselves. The defect  checks correspond to security sub-capabilities—  called sub-capabilities because each is part of a  larger capability. Capabilities and sub-capabilities  are both designed with the purpose of addressing  a series of attack steps. Automated assessments (in  the form of defect checks) are performed using the  test assessment method defned in SP 800-53A by  comparing a desired and actual state (or behavior).  NISTIR 8011 Volume 2  Automation Support for Security Control  Assessments: Hardware Asset Management  June 2017  https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/nistir/8011/  vol-2/fnal  https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.IR.8011-2  The NISTIR 8011 volumes focus on each  individual information security capability, adding  tangible detail to the more general overview given  in NISTIR 8011 Volume 1, and providing a template  for transition to a detailed, NIST standards- compliant automated assessment. This document,  Volume 2 of NISTIR 8011, addresses the Hardware  Asset Management (HWAM) information security  capability. The focus of the HWAM capability is to  manage the risks created by unmanaged and/or  unauthorized devices on a network. Unmanaged  devices are targets that attackers can use to gain  and more easily maintain a persistent platform from  which to attack the rest of the network.

PROJECT DESCRIPTIONS (NCCOE)  Capabilities Assessment for Securing  Manufacturing Industrial Control Systems:  Cybersecurity for Manufacturing  March 2017  https://nccoe.nist.gov/projects/use-cases/  capabilities-assessment-securing-manufacturing- industrial-control-systems  Industrial Control Systems (ICS) monitor  and control physical processes in many diferent  industries and sectors. Cyber attacks against ICS  devices present a real threat to organizations that  employ ICS to monitor and control manufacturing  processes. The NIST Engineering Laboratory (EL), in  conjunction with the National Cybersecurity Center  of Excellence, will produce a series of example  solutions demonstrating four cybersecurity  capabilities for manufacturing organizations.  Each example solution will highlight an individual  capability: Behavioral Anomaly Detection, ICS  Application Whitelisting, Malware Detection and  Mitigation, and ICS Data Integrity.  This capabilities assessment document is  part one of a four-part series and addresses only  behavioral anomaly detection capabilities. With  these capabilities in place, manufacturers may fnd it  easier to detect anomalous conditions, control what  programs and applications are executed in their  operating environments, mitigate malware attacks,  and ensure the integrity of critical operational  data. For each of the four capabilities listed above,  the NIST EL and the NCCoE will map the security  characteristics to the NIST Cybersecurity Framework  (CSF), which will provide standards-based security  controls for manufacturers. In addition, the EL and  the NCCoE will implement each of the capabilities  in two distinct but related lab settings: a robotics- based manufacturing enclave and a process control  enclave that resembles what is being used by  chemical manufacturing industries. This project  will result in a publicly available NIST Cybersecurity  Practice Guide, a detailed implementation guide  of the practical steps needed to implement the  cybersecurity example solution that addresses this  challenge.

However, these advantages can be  limited if unnecessary or complex authentication  requirements stand in the way of an ofcial  providing emergency services, especially when any  delay – even seconds – is a matter of containing  or exacerbating an emergency situation. The vast  diversity of public safety personnel, missions, and  operational environments magnifes the need for a  nimble authentication solution for public safety.  This project will explore various multifactor  authenticators currently in use by the public safety  community, or those potentially ofered in the future  as their next generation networks are brought  online. The efort will not only build an interoperable  solution that can accept various authenticators to  speed access to online systems while maintaining an  appropriate amount of security, but will also focus on  delivering single sign-on (SSO) capabilities to both  native and web/browser-based applications. It is not  enough to have an authenticator that is easy to use;  this project sets out to identify technical options for  the public safety community to consider deploying  to ensure that individuals in the feld are not kept  from meeting their mission goals by unnecessary  authentication prompts. This project will result in a  freely available NIST Cybersecurity Practice Guide,  detailing the technical decisions, trade-ofs, lessons  learned, and implementation instructions based on  market-dominant standards, such that public safety  organizations can accelerate the deployment of a  range of mobile authentication and SSO services to  their population of users.  Secure Inter-Domain Routing—Part 1: Route Hijacks  July 6, 2017  https://nccoe.nist.gov/projects/building-blocks/  secure-inter-domain-routing  Since the creation of the Internet, the Border  Gateway Protocol (BGP) has been the default  routing protocol to route trafc among organizations  (Internet Service Providers (ISPs) and Autonomous  Systems (ASes)). While the BGP protocol performs  adequately in identifying viable paths that  refect local routing policies and preferences to  destinations, the lack of built-in security allows  the protocol to be exploited. As a result, attacks  against Internet routing functions are a signifcant  and systemic threat to Internet-based information  systems. The consequences of these attacks can: (1)  deny access to Internet services; (2) detour Internet  trafc to permit eavesdropping and to facilitate on- path attacks on endpoints (sites); (3) misdeliver  Internet network trafc to malicious endpoints;  (4) undermine IP address-based reputation and  fltering systems; and (5) cause routing instability in  the Internet.  To improve the security of inter-domain routing  trafc exchange, NIST has begun the development of  a Special Publication (SP 800-189 – in preparation)  that provides security recommendations for  the use of inter-domain protocols and routing  technologies. These recommendations aim to  protect the integrity of Internet trafc exchange.  Implementing BGP Route Origin Validation (ROV)  based upon the Resource Public Key Infrastructure  (RPKI) can mitigate  accidental  and malicious  attacks associated with route hijacking. The NCCoE  understands that organizations and individuals  have Internet performance expectations and  requirements to protect against malicious cyber  attacks. It is expected that eventual wide-scale  deployment of RPKI-based ROV will signifcantly  enhance the overall security and robustness of  the Internet. This project will result in a NIST  Cybersecurity Practice Guide—a publicly available  description of the solution and practical steps  needed to implement practices that efectively  demonstrate the security and functionality of all  components of ROV.  Securing Property Management Systems:  Cybersecurity for the Hospitality Sector (DRAFT)  April 28, 2017  https://nccoe.nist.gov/projects/use_cases/  securing-property-management-systems  Hospitality organizations rely on Property  Management Systems (PMS) for daily tasks,  planning, and record keeping. As the operations  hub, the PMS interfaces with several services and  components within a hotel’s IT system, such as Point- of-Sale (POS) systems, door locks, Wi-Fi networks,  and other guest service applications. Adding to  148  https://nccoe.nist.gov/projects/building-blocks/secure-inter-domain-routing https://nccoe.nist.gov/projects/building-blocks/secure-inter-domain-routing https://nccoe.nist.gov/projects/use_cases/securing-property-management-systems https://nccoe.nist.gov/projects/use_cases/securing-property-management-systems  NIST/ITL CYBERSECURITY PROGRAM ANNUAL REPORT 2017  the complexity of connections, external business  partners’ components and services are also typically  connected to the PMS, such as on-premise spas  or restaurants, online travel agents, and customer  relationship management partners or applications  (on-premise or cloud-based). The numerous  connections to, and users of the PMS, could provide  a broader surface for attack by malicious actors. The  draft describes methods to improve the security of  the PMS, and how these methods can help protect  the business from network intrusions that might  lead to data breaches and fraud.  Based on industry research and in collaboration  with hospitality industry stakeholders, the NCCoE  is starting a project that aims to help hospitality  organizations implement stronger security measures  within and around the PMS, with a focus on the  POS system through network segmentation, point- to-point encryption, data tokenization, multifactor  authentication for remote and partner access, network  and user behavior analytics, and business-only usage  restrictions. In collaboration with the hospitality  business community and technology vendors who  implement standards that improve cybersecurity, the  NCCoE will explore methods to strengthen the security  of the PMS and its connections and will develop an  example implementation composed of open-source  and commercially available components. This project  will produce a NIST Cybersecurity Practice Guide—a  freely available description of the solution and  practical steps needed to efectively secure the PMS  and its many connections within the hotel IT system.  OTHER NIST PUBLICATIONS  Baldrige Cybersecurity Excellence Builder: Key  questions for improving your organization’s  cybersecurity performance, v1.0  April 2017  https://www.nist.gov/baldrige/products-services/  baldrige-cybersecurity-initiative  The Baldrige Cybersecurity Excellence Builder  is a voluntary self-assessment tool that enables  organizations to better understand the efectiveness  of their cybersecurity risk management eforts.  It helps your organization identify strengths and  opportunities for improvement in managing  cybersecurity risk based on your organization’s  mission, needs, and objectives. The Baldrige  Cybersecurity Excellence Builder combines  concepts in the Framework for Improving Critical  Infrastructure Cybersecurity (Cybersecurity  Framework) and the Baldrige Excellence  Framework. Like those two sources, it is not a one- size-fts-all approach. It is adaptable and scalable  to your organization’s needs, goals, capabilities,  and environment. It does not prescribe how you  should structure your organization’s cybersecurity  policies and operations. Through interrelated sets of  open-ended questions, it encourages you to use the  approaches that best ft your organization. Using  this self-assessment, you can:  • Determine cybersecurity-related activities that  are important to your business strategy and  critical service delivery;  • Prioritize your investments in managing  cybersecurity risk;  • Determine how best to enable your  workforce, customers, suppliers, partners, and  collaborators to be risk conscious and security  aware, and to fulfll their cybersecurity roles  and responsibilities;  • Assess the efectiveness and efciency of your  use of cybersecurity standards, guidelines,  and practices;  • Assess the cybersecurity results you achieve;  and  • Identify strengths to leverage and priorities for  improvement.  Framework for Improving Critical Infrastructure  Cybersecurity, Version 1.1 (DRAFT)  January 10, 2017  https://www.nist.gov/fle/344211  The national and economic security of the  United States depends on the reliable functioning  of its critical infrastructure. Cybersecurity threats  take advantage of the increased complexity and  connectivity of critical infrastructure systems,  placing the nation’s security at risk. To better protect  these systems, the President issued Executive  Order 13636, Improving Critical Infrastructure 149  https://www.nist.gov/baldrige/products-services/baldrige-cybersecurity-initiative https://www.nist.gov/baldrige/products-services/baldrige-cybersecurity-initiative https://www.nist.gov/file/344211  ITL CYBERSECURITY PUBLICATIONS |  FY 2017  Cybersecurity, on February 12, 2013. The Executive  Order established that “[i]t is the Policy of the  United States to enhance the security and resilience  of the nation’s critical infrastructure and to maintain  a cyber environment that encourages efciency,  innovation, and economic prosperity while  promoting safety, security, business confdentiality,  privacy, and civil liberties.” In enacting this policy,  the Executive Order calls for the development of  a voluntary risk-based Cybersecurity Framework  - a set of industry standards and best practices  to help organizations manage cybersecurity  risks. The resulting Framework, created through  collaboration between government and the private  sector, uses a common language to address and  manage cybersecurity risk in a cost-efective way,  based on business needs without placing additional  regulatory requirements on businesses. The  Framework enables organizations—regardless of  size, degree of cybersecurity risk, or cybersecurity  sophistication—to apply the principles and the best  risk management practices to improve the security  and resilience of the critical infrastructure. The  Framework provides organization and structure to  today’s multiple approaches to cybersecurity by  assembling standards, guidelines, and practices that  are working efectively in industry today. Moreover,  because it references globally recognized standards  for cybersecurity, the Framework can also be  used by organizations located outside the United  States and can serve as a model for international  cooperation on strengthening critical infrastructure  cybersecurity.

Cryptology ePrint  Archive, Report 2017/563, June 7, 2017, 26 pp.  http://ia.cr/2017/563  The Boyen-Li signature scheme [Asiacrypt’16]  is a major theoretical breakthrough. Via a clever  homomorphic evaluation of a pseudorandom  function over their verifcation key, they achieve  a reduction loss in security that is linear in the  underlying security parameter and entirely  independent of the number of message queries  made, while still maintaining short signatures  (consisting of a single short lattice vector). All  previous schemes with such an independent  reduction loss in security required a linear number  of such lattice vectors, and even in the classical  world, the only schemes achieving short signatures  relied on non-standard assumptions.  We improve on their result, providing a  verifcation key that is smaller by a linear factor, a  signifcantly tighter reduction with only a constant  loss, and signing and verifcation algorithms that  could plausibly run in about 1 second. Our main idea  is to change the scheme in a manner that allows us  to replace the pseudorandom function evaluation  with an evaluation of a much more efcient weak  pseudorandom function.

As an example of our  framework, we reprove a recent result from device- independent quantum cryptography: any linear  randomness expansion protocol can be converted  into an unbounded randomness expansion protocol.  We give a graphical exposition of a proof of this  result and implement parts of it in the Globular  proof assistant.  JOURNAL ARTICLES  P. Black , I. Bojanova.

Glasnik Matematicki 52(1), pp. 1-10  (2017).  https://web.math.pmf.unizg.hr/glasnik/vol_52/  no1_01.html  In this paper, we look at long geometric  progressions on diferent models of elliptic curves,  namely Weierstrass curves, Edwards and twisted  Edwards curves, Huf curves and general quartics  curves. By a geometric progression on an elliptic  curve, we mean the existence of rational points on  the curve whose x-coordinates (or y-coordinates)  are in geometric progression. We fnd infnite  families of twisted Edwards curves and Huf  curves with geometric progressions of length 5, an  infnite family of Weierstrass curves with 8-term  progressions, as well as infnite families of quartic  curves containing 10-term geometric progressions.

In this  work, we establish a correspondence between  Heron quadrilaterals and a family of elliptic curves  of the form y2 = x3 + ax2 − n2x. This correspondence  generalizes the notions of Goins and Maddox who  established a similar connection between Heron  triangles and elliptic curves. We further study this  family of elliptic curves, looking at their torsion  groups and ranks. We also explore their connection  with the a=0 case of congruent numbers.

Innovations in Systems and Software  Engineering 12(4), pp. 249-261 (December 2016).  https://doi.org/10.1007/s11334-015-0266-2  A key issue in testing is how many tests are  needed for a required level of coverage or fault  detection. Estimates are often based on error rates  in initial testing, or on code coverage. For example,  tests may be run until a desired level of statement  or branch coverage is achieved. Combinatorial  methods present an opportunity for a diferent  approach to estimating the required test-set size  using characteristics of the test set. This paper  describes methods for estimating the coverage of,  and ability to detect, t-way interaction faults of a  test set, based on a covering array. We also develop  a connection between (static) combinatorial  coverage and (dynamic) code coverage, such that  if a specifc condition is satisfed, 100 % branch  coverage is assured. Using these results, we propose  practical recommendations for using combinatorial  coverage in specifying test requirements, and for  improving estimates of the fault detection capacity  of a test set.

IEEE Software 33(6), pp. 16-19 (November/December  2016).  https://doi.org/10.1109/MS.2016.136  As new and exciting healthcare applications  arise that use smart technologies, the Internet of  Things, data analytics, and other technologies,  a critical problem is emerging: the potential loss  of caring. Although these exciting technologies  have improved patient care by allowing for better  assessment, surveillance, and treatment, their use  can disassociate the caregiver from the patient,  essentially removing the “care” from healthcare. So,  you can view caring as an undiscovered -ility that  ranks at least as important as other well-known  -ilities in healthcare systems.  P. Laplante, M. Kassab, N. Laplante and J. Voas.

In spite of the challenges, there is  a signifcant market for systems and products to  support caregivers in their tasks as the number of  people needing assistance grows substantially.

This has always been  the goal in the design of access control mechanisms,  but individual approaches can be inadequate.  Approaches that instantiate multiple methods  simultaneously have been shown to restrict access 152  https://doi.org/10.1007/s11334-015-0266-2 https://doi.org/10.1109/MS.2016.136 https://doi.org/10.1109/JSYST.2017.2662602 https://doi.org/10.22667/JOWUA.2017.03.31.004 http://math.colgate.edu/~integers/vol16.html  NIST/ITL CYBERSECURITY PROGRAM ANNUAL REPORT 2017                  with more precision. However, those approaches  have had limited scalability (resulting in exponential  calculations in some cases).  In this work, we provide an implementation of the  Next Generation Access Control (NGAC) standard  from the American National Standards Institute  (ANSI) and demonstrate that it scales. The existing  publicly available reference implementations all  use cubic algorithms for policy decisions, and  thus, NGAC was widely viewed as not scalable.  Our approach provides an easy to understand  graph algorithm that performs policy decisions in  linear time at the worst. However, in practice, the  algorithm runs considerably faster. We also provide  a default linear-time mechanism to visualize and  review user access rights for an ensemble of access  control mechanisms. Our visualization appears to  be a simple fle directory hierarchy, but in reality is  an automatically generated structure abstracted  from the underlying access control graph that  works with any set of simultaneously instantiated  access control policies. It also provides an implicit  mechanism for symbolic linking that provides a  powerful access capability. Our work has thus lead  to the frst efcient implementation of NGAC while  enabling user privilege review through a novel  visualization approach.  C. Miller and Y. Shi. Randomness in Nonlocal  Games Between Mistrustful Players. Quantum  Information & Computation 17(7&8), pp. 595-610  (June 2017).  https://doi.org/10.26421/QIC17.7-8  If two quantum players at a nonlocal game  $G$ achieve a superclassical score, then their  measurement outcomes must be at least partially  random from the perspective of any third player.  This is the basis for device-independent quantum  cryptography. In this paper we address a related  question: does a superclassical score at $G$  guarantee that one player has created randomness  from the perspective of the other player? We show  that for complete-support games, the answer is  yes; even if the second player is given the frst  player’s input at the conclusion of the game, he  cannot perfectly recover her output. Thus, some  amount of local randomness (i.e., randomness  possessed by only one player) is always obtained  when randomness is certifed from nonlocal games  with quantum strategies. This is in contrast to non- signaling game strategies, which may produce  global randomness without any local randomness.  We discuss potential implications for cryptographic  protocols between mistrustful parties.  D. Moody  and A.A. Ciss. Arithmetic Progressions  on Conics.

We also provide  infnite families of 3-term progressions on the unit  hyperbola, as well as conics ax2 + cy2 = 1 containing  arithmetic progressions as long as 8 terms.  D. Simos, D.R. Kuhn, A.

At the forefront of that was software metrics, along  with the corresponding software testing techniques  and tools and process improvement schemes that  relied on the software metrics.

Many  companies and organizations have made the  transition from traditional data centers to the  cloud due to its fexibility and lower cost. However,  traditional data centers are still being relied upon  by those who are less certain about the security of  cloud computing. This problem is highlighted by the  fact that there only exist limited eforts on threat  modeling for cloud data centers. In this paper, we  conduct comprehensive threat modeling exercises  based on two representative cloud infrastructures  using several popular threat modeling methods,  including attack surface, attack trees, attack graphs,  and security metrics based on attack trees and attack  graphs, respectively. Those threat modeling eforts  provide cloud providers with practical lessons and  the means toward better evaluating, understanding,  and improving their cloud infrastructures. Our  results may also improve confdence in potential  cloud tenants by providing them a clearer picture  about potential threats in cloud infrastructures and  corresponding solutions.  D. Borbor, L.

In Lecture Notes in Computer Science 10359, DBSec  2017: Data and Applications Security and Privacy XXXI,  pp. 509-528.  https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-61176-1_28  The administrators of a mission critical  network usually have to worry about non- traditional threats, e.g., how to live with known, but  unpatchable vulnerabilities, and how to improve the  network’s resilience against potentially unknown  vulnerabilities. To this end, network hardening is a  well-known preventive security solution that aims  to improve network security by taking proactive  actions, namely, hardening options. However,  most existing network hardening approaches rely  on a single hardening option, such as disabling  unnecessary services, which becomes less efective  when it comes to dealing with unknown and  unpatchable vulnerabilities. A heterogeneous  approach is lacking that can combine diferent  hardening options in an optimal way to deal with  both unknown and unpatchable vulnerabilities.  In this paper, we propose such an approach by  unifying multiple hardening options, such as  frewall rule modifcation, disabling services, service  diversifcation, and access control, under the same  model. We then apply security metrics designed  for evaluating network resilience against unknown  and unpatchable vulnerabilities, and consequently  154  https://doi.org/10.1109/MC.2017.144 https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-51966-1_20 https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-61176-1_28  NIST/ITL CYBERSECURITY PROGRAM ANNUAL REPORT 2017  derive optimal hardening solutions that maximize  security under given cost constraints.

NDAC  imposes access control at the data level, eliminating  the need for implementing and managing access  control in applications and/or through the use of  proprietary RDBMS mechanisms. Consequently,  the same policies can protect multiple databases  from queries sent from multiple applications.  Furthermore, NDAC not only provides control down  to the feld level, but to varying felds of select rows.  NDAC is unique in achieving this granularity of  control without the use and coordination of multiple  protection mechanisms. Operationally, users issue  wide sweeping queries, and NDAC allows access  to the optimal amount of data permissible for the  user. The method includes an Access Manager for  trapping and enforcing policy over the SQL queries  issued by applications, as well as a Translator for  converting SQL statements to NGAC inputs and  converting NGAC authorization responses to either  an access deny or one or more permitted SQL  statements.

We prove a (3+1/86)n-o(n) lower bound on  the size of such a circuit for an explicitly defned  predicate, namely an afne disperser for sublinear  dimension. This improves the 3n-o(n) bound of  Norbert Blum (1984). The proof is based on the gate  elimination technique extended with the following  three ideas. We generalize the computational model  by allowing circuits to contain cycles; this in turn  allows us to perform afne substitutions. We use a  carefully chosen circuit complexity measure to track  the progress of the gate elimination process. Finally,  we use quadratic substitutions that may be viewed  as delayed afne substitutions.  Y. Hanatani, N. Ogura, Y. Ohba, L. Chen and S.  Das.

SSR 2016, pp. 227- 243.  https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-49100-4_10  Controlling a large number of devices such as  sensors and smart end points is always a challenge  where scalability and security are indispensable.  This is even more important when it comes to  periodic confguration updates to a large number  of such devices belonging to one or more groups.  One solution could be to take a group of devices  as a unit of control and then manage them through  a group communication mechanism. An obvious  challenge to this approach is how to create such  groups dynamically and manage them securely.  Moreover, there need to be mechanisms in place by  which members of the group can be removed and  added dynamically.  In this paper, we propose a technique that has  been recently standardized in IEEE 802.21 (IEEE Std  802.21d™-2015) with the objective of providing a  standard-based solution to the above challenges.  The approach relies on the Logical Key Hierarchy  (LKH) based key distribution mechanism, but  optimizes the number of encryption and decryption  operations by using a “Complete Subtree”. It  leverages the IEEE 802.21 framework, services, and  protocol for communication and management, and  provides a scalable and secure way to manage (e.g.,  add and remove) devices from one or more groups.  We describe the group key distribution protocol 155  https://doi.org/10.1145/3041048.3041050 https://doi.org/10.1109/FOCS.2016.19 https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-49100-4_10  ITL CYBERSECURITY PUBLICATIONS |  FY 2017  in detail and provide a security analysis of the  scheme along with some performance results from  a prototype implementation.

Micro-Signatures: The  Efectiveness of Known Bad N-Grams for Network  Anomaly Detection. 9th International Symposium on  Foundations and Practice of Security, Québec City,  Québec, Canada, October 24-26, 2016.

The former  identifes patterns associated with known attacks,  and the latter attempts to learn a “normal” pattern  of activity and provides an alert when behaviors  outside of those norms is detected. The n-gram  methodology has arguably been the most successful  technique for network anomaly detection. In this  work, we discovered that when training data is  sanitized, n-gram anomaly detection is not primarily  anomaly detection, as it receives the majority of  its performance from an implicit non-anomaly  subsystem that neither uses typical signatures nor is  anomaly-based (though it is closely related to both).  We fnd that for our data, these “micro-signatures”  provide the vast majority of the detection capability.  This fnding changes how we understand and  approach n-gram based ‘anomaly’ detection. By  understanding the foundational principles upon  which it operates, we can then better explore how  to optimally improve it.  J. Jones, T. Khan, K. Laskey, A. Nelson, M. Laamanen  and D. White. Inferring Previously Uninstalled  Applications from Digital Traces. Proceedings of the  11th Annual Conference on Digital Forensics, Security  and Law (ADFSL), Daytona Beach, Florida, May 24-26,  2017, pp. 113-130.  http://commons.erau.edu/adfsl/2016/wednesday/3/  In this paper, we present an approach and  experimental results to suggest the past presence  of an application after the application has been  uninstalled and the system has remained in use.  Current techniques rely on the recovery of intact  artifacts and traces, e.g., whole fles, Windows  Registry entries, or log fle entries, while our  approach requires no intact artifact recovery and  leverages trace evidence in the form of residual  partial fles. In the case of recently uninstalled  applications or an instrumented infrastructure,  artifacts and traces may be intact and complete.  In most cases, however, digital artifacts and traces  are altered, destroyed, and disassociated over time,  due to normal system operation and deliberate  obfuscation activity. As a result, analysts are often  presented with partial and incomplete artifacts and  traces from which defensible conclusions must be  drawn.  In this work, we match the sectors from a hard  disk of interest to a previously constructed catalog  of full fles captured while various applications  were installed, used, and uninstalled. The sectors  composing the fles in the catalog are not necessarily  unique to each fle or application, so we use an  inverse frequency-weighting scheme to compute  the inferential value of matched sectors. Similarly,  we compute the fraction of full fles associated  with each application that is matched, where each  fle with a sector match is weighted by the fraction  of total catalog sectors matched for that fle. We  compared results using both the sector-weighted  and fle-weighted values for known ground truth- test images and fnal-snapshot images from the  M57 Patents Scenario data set. The fle-weighted  measure was slightly more accurate than the  sector-weighted measure, although both identifed  all of the uninstalled applications in the test images  and a high percentage of installed and uninstalled  applications in the M57 data set, with minimal false  positives for both sets.  The key contribution of our work is the  suggestion of uninstalled applications through  weighted measurement of residual fle fragments.  Our experimental results indicate that past  application activity can be reliably indicated even  after an application has been uninstalled, and the  host system has been rebooted and used. The rapid  and reliable indication of previously uninstalled  applications is useful for cyber defense, law  enforcement, and intelligence operations.  L. Khati, N. Mouha and D. Vergnaud.

In the context of FDE, it is assumed  that there is no space to store additional data, such  as an IV (Initialization Vector) or a MAC (Message  Authentication Code) value. We formally defne  the security notions in this model against chosen- plaintext and chosen-ciphertext attacks. Then, we  classify various FDE modes of operation according  to their security in this setting, in the presence of  various restrictions on the queries of the adversary.  We found that our approach leads to new insights  for both theory and practice. Moreover, we  introduce the notion of a diversifer, which does not  require additional storage, but allows the plaintext  of a particular sector to be encrypted to diferent  ciphertexts. We show how a 2-bit diversifer can  be implemented in the EagleTree simulator for  solid state drives (SSDs), while decreasing the total  number of Input/Output Operations Per Second  (IOPS) by only 4 %.

In IFIP Advances  in Information and Communication Technology 511,  Advances in Digital Forensics XIII, Revised Selected  Papers, pp. 111-130.  https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-67208-3_7  Cloud computing provides benefts such as  increased fexibility, scalability and cost savings  to enterprises. However, it introduces several  challenges to digital forensic investigations. Current  forensic analysis frameworks and tools are largely  intended for ofine investigations, and it is assumed  that the logs are under investigator control. In cloud  computing, however, evidence can be distributed  across several machines, most of which would  be outside the control of the investigator. Other  challenges include the dependence of forensically  valuable data on the cloud deployment model, large  volumes of data, proprietary data formats, multiple  isolated virtual machine instances running on a  single physical machine and inadequate tools for  conducting cloud forensic investigations.  This research demonstrates that evidence from  multiple sources can be used to reconstruct cloud  attack scenarios. The sources include: (i) intrusion  detection system and application software logs; (ii)  cloud service API calls; and (iii) system calls from  virtual machines. A forensic analysis framework for  cloud computing environments is presented that  considers logged data related to activities in the  application layer as well as lower layers. A Prolog- based forensic analysis tool is used to automate  the correlation of evidence from clients and the  cloud service provider in order to reconstruct attack  scenarios in a forensic investigation.

MIST ‘16: Proceedings  of the 8th ACM CCS International Workshop on  Managing Insider Security Threats, Vienna, Austria,  October 24-28, 2016, pp. 13-22.  https://doi.org/10.1145/2995959.2995961  The American National Standards Organization  has standardized an access control approach, Next  Generation Access Control (NGAC), that enables  the simultaneous instantiation of multiple access  157  https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-52153-4_14 https://doi.org/10.1109/QRS-C.2017.106 https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-67208-3_7 https://doi.org/10.1145/2995959.2995961  ITL CYBERSECURITY PUBLICATIONS |  FY 2017  control policies. For large complex enterprises,  this is critical to limiting the legally authorized  access by insiders. However, the specifcations  describe the required access control capabilities  but not the related algorithms. Existing reference  implementations have inefcient algorithms and  thus, do not fully express the NGAC’s ability to scale.  For example, the primary NGAC reference  implementation took several minutes to simply  display the set of fles accessible to a user on a  moderately sized system. To solve this problem, we  provide efcient algorithms, reducing the overall  complexity from cubic to quadratic. Our other major  contribution is to provide a novel mechanism for  administrators and users to review allowed access  rights. We provide an interface that appears to be  a simple fle directory hierarchy but in reality is an  automatically generated structure abstracted from  the underlying access control graph that works  with any set of simultaneously instantiated access  control policies. Our work thus provides the frst  efcient implementation of NGAC while enabling  user privilege review through a novel visualization  approach. It thereby enables the efcient  simultaneous instantiation of multiple access control  policies that is needed to best limit insider access to  information (and thereby limit information leakage).

Proceedings of the 2nd Annual Industrial  Control System Security Workshop (ICSS ‘16), Los  Angeles, California, December 6, 2016, pp. 15-22.  https://doi.org/10.1145/3018981.3018986  Defense-in-depth is an important security  architecture principle that has signifcant application  to industrial control systems (ICS), cloud services,  storehouses of sensitive data, and many other areas.  We claim that an ideal defense-in-depth posture  is “deep,” containing many layers of security, and  “narrow,” the number of node independent attack  paths is minimized. Unfortunately, accurately  calculating both depth and width is difcult using  standard graph algorithms because of a lack of  independence between multiple vulnerability  instances (i.e., if an attacker can penetrate a  particular vulnerability on one host, then they  can likely penetrate the same vulnerability on  another host). To address this, we represent known  weaknesses and vulnerabilities as a type of colored  attack graph. We measure depth and width through  solving the shortest color path and minimum color  cut problems. We prove both of these to be NP- Hard and thus, for our solution, we provide a suite  of greedy heuristics. We then empirically apply our  approach to large randomly generated networks as  well as to ICS networks generated from a published  ICS attack template. Lastly, we discuss how to  use these results to help guide improvements to  defense-in-depth postures.  D. Moody, R. Perlner and D. Smith-Tone.  Improved Attacks for Characteristic-2 Parameters  of the Cubic ABC Simple Matrix Encryption  Scheme. 8th International Workshop on Post- Quantum Cryptography (PQCrypto 2017), Utrecht,  The Netherlands, June 26-28, 2017. In Lecture  Notes in Computer Science 10346, Post-Quantum  Cryptography - PQCrypto 2017, pp. 255-271.  https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-59879-6_15  In the last few years multivariate public key  cryptography has experienced an infusion of new  ideas for encryption. Among these new strategies is  the ABC Simple Matrix family of encryption schemes  that utilize the structure of a large matrix algebra to  construct efectively invertible systems of nonlinear  equations hidden by an isomorphism of polynomials.  One promising approach to cryptanalyzing these  schemes has been structural cryptanalysis, based  on applying a strategy similar to MinRank attacks to  the discrete diferential. These attacks however have  been signifcantly more expensive when applied to  parameters using felds of characteristic 2, which  have been the most common choice for published  parameters. This disparity is especially great for  the cubic version of the Simple Matrix Encryption  Scheme.  In this work, we demonstrate a technique that  can be used to implement a structural attack that  is as efcient against parameters of characteristic 2  as are attacks against analogous parameters over  higher characteristic felds. This attack demonstrates  that, not only is the cubic simple matrix scheme  susceptible to structural attacks, but that the  published parameters claiming 80 bits of security  are less secure than claimed (albeit only slightly.) 158  https://doi.org/10.1145/3018981.3018986 https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-59879-6_15  NIST/ITL CYBERSECURITY PROGRAM ANNUAL REPORT 2017  Similar techniques can also be applied to improve  structural attacks against the original Simple  Matrix Encryption scheme, but they represent only  a modest improvement over previous structural  attacks. This work therefore demonstrates that  choosing a feld of characteristic 2 for the Simple  Matrix Encryption Scheme or its cubic variant will  not provide any additional security value.  A.

HMFEv - An Efcient Multivariate Signature  Scheme. 8th International Workshop on Post- Quantum Cryptography (PQCrypto 2017), Utrecht,  The Netherlands, June 26-28, 2017. In Lecture  Notes in Computer Science 10346, Post-Quantum  Cryptography - PQCrypto 2017, pp. 205-223.  https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-59879-6_12  Multivariate Cryptography, as one of the  main candidates for establishing post-quantum  cryptosystems, provides strong, efcient and well- understood digital signature schemes such as  Unbalanced Oil-Vinegar (UOV), Rainbow, and Gui.  While Gui provides very short signatures, it is, for  efciency reasons, restricted to very small fnite  felds, which makes it hard to scale it to higher levels  of security and leads to large key sizes.  In this paper we propose a signature scheme  called HMFEv (“Hidden Medium Field Equations”),  which can be seen as a multivariate version of HFEv  (“Hidden Field Equation”). We obtain our scheme  by applying the Vinegar Variation to the Multi-HFE  encryption scheme of Chen et al. We show both  theoretically and by experiments that our new  scheme is secure against direct and Rank attacks.  In contrast to other schemes of the HFE family such  as Gui, HMFEv can be defned over arbitrary base  felds and therefore is much more efcient in terms  of both performance and memory requirements.  Our scheme is therefore a good candidate for  the upcoming standardization of post-quantum  signature schemes.  M. Raunak, D.R. Kuhn and R.N. Kacker.  Combinatorial Testing of Full Text Search in Web  Applications. Proceedings. 2017 IEEE International  Conference on Software Quality, Reliability and  Security (Companion Volume) (QRS-C 2017), Prague,  159 Czech Republic, July 25-29, 2017, pp. 100-107.  https://doi.org/10.1109/QRS-C.2017.24  Database-driven web applications are some of  the most widely developed systems today. In this  paper, we demonstrate the use of combinatorial  testing for testing database-supported web  applications, especially where full-text search is  provided or many combinations of search options  are utilized. We develop test-case selection  techniques, where test strings are synthesized using  characters or string fragments that may lead to  system failure. We have applied our approach to the  National Vulnerability Database (NVD) application  and have discovered a number of “corner-cases”  that had not been identifed previously. We also  present simple heuristics for isolating the fault- causing factors that can lead to such system failures.  The test method and input model described in this  paper have immediate application to other systems  that provide complex full text search.  X. Sun, A. Singhal and P. Liu. Towards Actionable  Mission Impact Assessment in the Context of Cloud  Computing. 31st IFIP Annual Conference on Data and  Applications Security and Privacy (DBSEC 2017),  Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, July 19-21, 2017. In Lecture  Notes in Computer Science 10359, DBSec 2017: Data  and Applications Security and Privacy XXXI, pp. 259- 274.  https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-61176-1_14  Today’s cyber-attacks toward enterprise  networks often undermine and even fail the mission  assurance of victim networks. Mission cyber  resilience (or active cyber defense) is critical to  prevent or minimize the negative consequences that  would impact missions. Without efective mission  impact assessment, mission cyber resilience cannot  be really achieved. However, there is an overlooked  gap between mission impact assessment and cyber  resilience due to the non-mission-centric nature of  current research. This gap is even widened in the  context of cloud computing. The gap essentially  accounts for the weakest link between missions and  attack-resilient systems, and also explains why the  existing impact analysis is not really actionable.  This paper initiates eforts to bridge this  gap by developing a novel graphical model that  interconnects the mission dependency graphs and  https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-59879-6_12 https://doi.org/10.1109/QRS-C.2017.24 https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-61176-1_14  ITL CYBERSECURITY PUBLICATIONS |  FY 2017  cloud-level attack graphs. Our case study shows  that the new cloud-applicable model is able to  bridge the gap between mission impact assessment  and cyber resilience. As a result, it can signifcantly  improve the efectiveness of the cyber resilience  analysis of mission critical systems.  S. Vilkomir, A. Alluri, D.R. Kuhn and R.N. Kacker.  Combinatorial and MC/DC Coverage Levels of  Random Testing. 2017 IEEE International Conference  on Software Quality Reliability and Security (QRS-C  2017), Prague, Czech Republic, July 25-29, 2017, pp.  61-68.  https://doi.org/10.1109/QRS-C.2017.19  Software testing criteria difer in their  efectiveness, the numbers of test cases required,  and the processes of test generation. Specifc  criteria often are compared to random testing, and  in some cases, random testing shows a surprisingly  high level of efectiveness. One reason that this is the  case is that any random test set has a specifc level  of coverage according to any coverage criterion. The  numerical evaluation of coverage levels of random  testing according to various coverage criteria is  an interesting research task and is important in  understanding the relationship between diferent  testing approaches.  In this paper, we performed an experimental  evaluation of the coverage levels of random testing  for two criteria: Modifed Condition/Decision  Coverage (MC/DC) and combinatorial t-way  testing. Our experiments showed that, when the  number of random test cases increased, a high level  of coverage was reached rapidly, both for MC/DC  and t-way. However, many more random tests are  required to reach 100 % coverage. An unexpected  result was that there were signifcant diferences  in the measurement of partial MC/DC coverage  by various tools. The results may be used to select  optimal methods for practical testing and develop  new testing methods based on the integration of  existing approaches.  160  https://doi.org/10.1109/QRS-C.2017.19  NIST/ITL CYBERSECURITY PROGRAM ANNUAL REPORT 2017  161  APPENDICES  The next section contains 3 Appendices (List of Acronyms, NIST/ITL  Cybersecurity Events, and Ways to Engage with ITL Cybersecurity  Program and NIST).

Cybersecurity risk management issues are becoming increasingly familiar topics in  executive management ofces and boardrooms. That is as true for businesses as it is for federal and other  government organizations.  No doubt that is because every year brings more troubling reports of organizations experiencing fnancial and  reputational damage from both novel and well-known threats and vulnerabilities. But what does not get nearly  as much attention are the impressive advances that so many organizations have been making in thoughtfully  and successfully securing their information and processes and the systems upon which those organizations,  their leaders, and their customers depend.  That’s where the cybersecurity work of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) comes  into play. For nearly 50 years, we have been helping organizations to succeed in building the strategies and  in employing the tools needed to better recognize, anticipate, and manage cybersecurity risks. Our diverse  cybersecurity activities are an essential ingredient in carrying out the NIST Information Technology Laboratory’s  mission: to cultivate trust in information and technology. We do that by conducting foundational and applied  cybersecurity research to produce and advance cybersecurity standards, best practices, measurements, and  reference resources. While NIST has an explicit statutory mission to focus on federal government agencies,  our work can and is being heavily leveraged by large and small businesses, state and local agencies, and other  organizations. Ultimately, this benefts taxpayers, investors, consumers, our digital economy, and our national  security.  However, we don’t work alone. To the contrary, all cybersecurity eforts at NIST are based on input from, and  often in cooperation with, the private sector and other government agencies.  We also don’t work in the dark. NIST prides itself on being transparent, open, and collaborative. When we  actively engage the private and public sectors, we rely on and use experts from around the country – and around  the globe – to complement the talents of our own staf. Exposing our thinking to others helps to improve the  quality, relevance, and likely use of the end product.  This report features some of our most signifcant accomplishments during Fiscal Year (FY) 2017 in risk  management, cryptography, identity and access management, vulnerability management, education and  workforce development, and internet and communications infrastructure, as well as our eforts to transition our  work into common practice. Below are just a few highlights of the work carried out in 2017.  • In recent years, there has been a substantial amount of research on quantum computers – machines  that exploit quantum mechanical phenomena to solve problems that are difcult or intractable for  conventional computers. If large-scale quantum computers are ever built, they will be able to break the  existing infrastructure of public-key cryptography. Employing NIST’s proven approach of worldwide  open competitions, in 2016 we solicited submissions for quantum-resistant public-key cryptographic  algorithms for standards.  These algorithms must be secure against both quantum and classical  computers and should interoperate with existing communications protocols and networks. We now are  engaging the cryptographic community in the difcult work of determining how the 69 submissions we  received in 2017 meet the competition’s exacting requirements.  • In instances where many devices are interconnected and working in concert to accomplish some task,  security and privacy can be very important but hard to achieve due to limited capabilities available  to handle modern cryptographic algorithms. This includes automotive systems, sensor networks,  1  healthcare, distributed control systems, the smart grid, and cyber-physical systems and the Internet of  Things (IoT). Recognizing this special challenge and in order to gain greater awareness and involvement  with the cryptographic community, NIST shared its fndings in this area (known as lightweight  cryptography) and presented our plans to address standardization issues for community feedback.  • NIST improved two widely used guidelines that provide senior leaders with the information they need  to make risk-based decisions afecting critical mission and business functions. We proposed revisions  to Security and Privacy Controls for Information Systems and Organizations (Special Publication (SP)  800-53) and Risk Management Framework for Information Systems and Organizations (SP 800-37). The  latter provides a closer link between risk management processes and activities at various organizational  levels. It demonstrates how the Cybersecurity Framework can be implemented using established Risk  Management Framework processes. Both publications will be fnalized in 2018.  • Refecting a growing recognition of the link between cybersecurity and privacy risk management, we  collaborated with internal and external partners to integrate privacy requirements and considerations  into SP 800-53 and SP 800-37 risk management guidelines as well as our latest version of NIST’s Digital  Identity Guidelines (SP 800-63-3), which covers digital identity from the initial risk assessment to the  deployment of federated identity solutions. These guidelines build the foundation needed to make  privacy and security equal, quality attributes in trustworthy systems. We focused on encouraging the  adoption of trusted identities through digital identity standards for federal agencies and internationally.  • The supply chain that provides the information and operational technology (IT/OT) upon which we all  depend has evolved into a complex, globally distributed, dynamic ecosystem enabling the development  of highly refned, sophisticated, cost-efective, and reusable solutions. In FY 2017, we published a  proposed process model providing a method to identify and prioritize IT/OT systems and components.  The approach aims to increase an organization’s ability to make cost-efective risk decisions by  determining the systems and components that have the greatest impact on the organization and that  would potentially cause the most harm if compromised.  • As NIST continues to collaborate with stakeholders to raise awareness and encourage the use of the  voluntary Cybersecurity Framework, we solicited public comments on a draft update of the frst (2014)  version and hosted a widely attended workshop that charted progress and shared issues to which  NIST now has given additional attention. In May 2017, the President’s Executive Order 13800 directed  federal agency heads to use the Cybersecurity Framework to manage cybersecurity risk. In response,  NIST released draft guidance on how the Risk Management Framework and Cybersecurity Framework  can work together to help agencies develop, implement, and continuously improve their information  security programs. After incorporating public comments, NIST released the Baldrige Cybersecurity  Excellence Builder, a self-assessment tool based in part on the Cybersecurity Framework, to help  organizations better understand the efectiveness of their cybersecurity risk management eforts.  • In FY 2017, NIST’s National Cybersecurity Center of Excellence (NCCoE) began taking full advantage  of its expanded, more capable facilities to accelerate the adoption of standards-based, security  technologies. Healthcare and fnancial services were two areas that had notable progress, including  the development of new draft practice guides on securing wireless infusion pumps and on managing  access rights for the fnancial sector. NCCoE also leveraged industry partners’ expertise to produce a  guide on how organizations can develop strategies to recover operating systems, user fles, applications,  and other IT assets from data corruption events such as ransomware. The guide also ofers insights on  auditing, reporting, and investigations following a company’s discovery of such destructive security  incidents. Other guides addressed the authentication of mobile device users with personal identity  verifcation credentials and how organizations can use attribute-based access controls to better  manage employee access to data and networks.  WELCOME LETTER | FY 2017  2  NIST/ITL CYBERSECURITY PROGRAM ANNUAL REPORT 2017  • The NIST-led National Initiative for Cybersecurity Education (NICE) made noteworthy strides in FY  2017 to foster, energize, and promote a robust network and an integrated ecosystem of cybersecurity  education, training, and workforce development. We published the NICE Cybersecurity Workforce  Framework, establishing a taxonomy and common lexicon to describe all cybersecurity work and  workers, irrespective of where or for whom the work is performed. NICE launched “CyberSeek,”an  online tool that provides a visualization of the demand for and the supply of cybersecurity workers  across the country as well as career pathways in cybersecurity. Via NICE, NIST served as the Commerce  Department’s lead, working with the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to analyze U.S.  cybersecurity workforce issues and ofer recommendations in response to the President’s May 2017  Executive Order.  Looking ahead - with full knowledge that new challenges are constantly emerging - we are moving towards  collaborating with industry, government agencies, and others who use NIST’s cybersecurity research, standards,  and guides. For example, in FY 2018 NIST is assigning higher priority to the cybersecurity and privacy aspects  of the Internet of Things (IoT). Researchers in our Cybersecurity for IoT program are working with industry  to produce guidance and best practices, as well as to perform research and coordinate standards within and  across sectors in the digital economy. We are reviewing international standards-based approaches to the IoT  challenges and ramping up our IoT-related identity work. NIST is also launching a project to provide organizations  with practical guidance to reduce the vulnerability of IoT devices to botnets and other automated distributed  threats, while also limiting the utility of compromised devices to malicious actors. Such eforts are paving the  way toward more secure IoT devices in the future.  In addition to the work in IoT, NIST has embarked on a project to automate much of the testing required  under the cryptographic validation programs. We expect that automated cryptographic algorithm testing will  be complete in 2018, and we will then begin developing methods to automate the testing of cryptographic  modules. These eforts in automation are intended to provide a higher trust in the assurance claims made by the  product developers, but do so in an efcient, and cost-efective manner that allows the vendors’ conformance  eforts to keep pace with the changing IT landscape.  By investing in a more robust testing infrastructure, NIST  hopes that product vendors will take advantage of this service by validating their products more often, which  will produce more secure products.  In reporting on our accomplishments, NIST welcomes all suggestions about how we can improve our work.  We do this so that we can provide the nation with the kind of cybersecurity information and tools needed to  cultivate trust in information and technology while advancing and protecting our economy and our nation.  All projects in this report include contact information for the key NIST contacts. Let us hear from you.  Donna F. Dodson,  NIST Chief Cybersecurity Advisor  3  BACKGROUND INFORMATION OF ANNUAL REPORT  This Annual Report provides the opportunity to describe the many cybersecurity program highlights and  accomplishments from throughout the NIST Information Technology Laboratory (ITL).

INTRODUCTION | FY 2017  4  NIST/ITL CYBERSECURITY PROGRAM ANNUAL REPORT 2017  THE INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY LABORATORY  IMPLEMENTS THE FEDERAL INFORMATION  SECURITY MANAGEMENT ACT  This section contains a list of the major activities that were  accomplished during FY 2017 by the ITL Cybersecurity Program.  Detailed explanations of these activities are provided in the next  section.  5  ITL IMPLEMENTS THE FISMA ACTIvITIES |  FY 2017  INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY  LABORATORY (ITL)  CYBERSECURITY PROGRAM  IMPLEMENTS FEDERAL  INFORMATION SECURITY  MANAGEMENT ACT  The E-Government Act, Public Law 107-347,  passed by the 107th Congress and signed into law  by the President in December 2002, recognized the  importance of information security to the economic  and national security interests of the United States.  Title III of the E-Government Act, titled the Federal  Information Security Management Act (FISMA) of  2002, included the duties and responsibilities for  the National Institute of Standards and Technology,  Information Technology Laboratory (ITL). There  are multiple divisions within ITL that are involved  with cybersecurity programs and projects. The  work is being conducted collaboratively between  the divisions. In December 2014, the 113th Congress  updated FISMA as the Federal Information Security  Modernization Act (Public Law 113-283). NIST ITL  responsibilities were unchanged in the update. In FY  2017, the ITL Cybersecurity Program addressed its  assignment through the following major activities:  • Forty-one NIST Special Publications (SP) (20  approved as fnal and 21 drafts) were issued,  providing management, operational, and  technical security guidelines in a variety of  topic areas, including:  The 2016 Annual Report, the National  Initiative for Cybersecurity Education (NICE)  Cybersecurity Workforce Framework,  attribute-based access control and access  control standards and policies, application  container security, Secure Hash Algorithm-3  (SHA-3) derived functions, cybersecurity  event recovery, data integrity, recovering  from ransomware and other destructive  events, securing Apple OS X 10.10 systems,  protecting controlled unclassifed information  in nonfederal information systems and  organizations, systems security engineering,  cyber threat information sharing, bluetooth  security, the National Checklist Program,  digital identity guidelines, block cipher modes  of operation, the Cipher-Based Message  Authentication Code (CMAC) - a Mode for  Authentication, an introduction to information  security, a report of the workshop on software  measures and metrics to reduce security  vulnerabilities, platform frmware resiliency,  fog computing, de-identifying government  datasets, Long Term Evolution (LTE) security,  trustworthy email, security recommendations  for hypervisor deployment, the Triple Data  Encryption Algorithm (TDEA) Block Cipher,  key-derivation methods in key-establishment  schemes, pair-wise key-establishment  schemes using discrete logarithm  cryptography, security and privacy controls, a  risk management framework for information  systems and organizations, personal identity  verifcation (PIV) credentials, access rights  management for the fnancial services sector,  securing wireless infusion pumps in healthcare  delivery organizations, situational awareness  for electric utilities, and domain name systems- based electronic mail security.  • Fifteen NIST Interagency/Internal Reports  (NISTIR) (10 approved as fnal and 5 drafts)  were issued on a variety of topics, including:  A criticality analysis process model,  security assurance challenges for container  deployment, the cybersecurity framework for  federal agencies, a cybersecurity framework  manufacturing profle, dramatically reducing  software vulnerabilities, code complexity  on software analysis, identifying uniformity  with entropy and divergence, enhancing  resilience of the Internet and communications  ecosystem, mobile application vetting services  for public safety, lightweight cryptography,  privacy engineering and risk management  in federal systems, automation support for  security control assessments, and small  business information security.  • Formally Launched a Post-Quantum  Cryptography (PQC) Standardization  Process:  The research community has actively  responded to the NIST Call for Proposals to 6  NIST/ITL CYBERSECURITY PROGRAM ANNUAL REPORT 2017  solicit, evaluate, and standardize quantum- resistant public key cryptography (also known  as post-quantum cryptography (PQC))  algorithms. Upon the submission deadline,  NIST received 82 submissions from 26  countries and 6 continents, among which 69  submissions are considered as complete and  proper. The NIST Post-Quantum Cryptography  team has worked closely with the submitters  and the research community to evaluate and  analyze the frst-round candidates.  • Lightweight Cryptography Standards for the  Internet of Things (IoT):  The Internet of Things (IoT) tethers  heterogeneous “things” together. Some of the  “things” are resource constrained. Lightweight  cryptography provides critical tools for IoT  security. To better understand the need for  dedicated lightweight cryptography, the  NIST team released a white paper in 2017 to  specify two major portfolios for lightweight  cryptography primitives. NIST will announce a  call for proposals on lightweight cryptography  primitives in 2018.  • A NIST / Industry joint working group  continued the development of automated  cryptographic implementation testing:  After working with industry on the protocol  necessary to exchange cryptographic  test data in an automated fashion, the  development of the cryptographic algorithm  testing service to be hosted at NIST is fully  under way, with the full implementation  expected in FY 2018. (See: http://csrc.nist.gov/  projects/acvt).  • Published an Initial Public Draft of Special  Publication (SP) 800-53, Revision 5:  NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5, Security and  Privacy Controls for Information Systems  and Organizations, is a comprehensive set of  safeguarding measures that are applicable to  all types of computing platforms, including  traditional IT systems, cloud and mobile  systems, industrial/process control systems,  and Internet of Things (IoT) devices. The  safeguarding measures in the update to  7 this publication include a full integration of  security and privacy controls to protect the  operations and assets of organizations and the  personal privacy of individuals. Additionally,  this update promotes the integration with  diferent risk management and cybersecurity  approaches and lexicons, including the  Cybersecurity Framework.  The Initial Public  Comment period resulted in over 3000  comments from over 115 diferent stakeholders  representing the public and private sectors,  and academia.  • Published a Discussion Draft of SP 800-37,  Revision 2:  This update to NIST SP 800-37 Revision 2,  Risk Management Framework for Information  Systems and Organizations: A System Life  Cycle Approach for Security and Privacy,  responds to the call by the Defense Science  Board, the President’s Executive Order on  Strengthening the Cybersecurity of Federal  Networks and Critical Infrastructure, and  the Ofce of Management and Budget  Memorandum M-17-25, to develop the next- generation Risk Management Framework  (RMF) for systems and organizations.  This  update provides linkage and communication  between the risk management processes and  activities at the executive and operational  levels of the organization; demonstrates  how the Cybersecurity Framework can be  implemented using the established NIST risk  management processes (i.e., developing a  Federal use case); and integrates privacy  concepts into the RMF.  This discussion draft  was issued to inform a public workshop for  RMF stakeholders and featured discussions on  the risk management methodologies used in  various sectors and potential opportunities to  improve the RMF.  • The Cyber Supply Chain Risk Management  (C-SCRM) program continued to work  with stakeholders to develop and improve  FISMA-related guidance on C-SCRM:  C-SCRM controls were signifcantly modifed  in a draft of NIST SP 800-53, Security and  Privacy Controls for Information Systems  and Organizations, to better align with  other guidance. A working group co-chaired  by NIST and the Department of Defense  http://csrc.nist.gov/projects/acvt http://csrc.nist.gov/projects/acvt  ITL IMPLEMENTS THE FISMA ACTIvITIES |  FY 2017     completed a revision of Committee On incorporated into a proof-of-concept software  National Security Systems Directives (CNSSD) tool that is freely available.  Number 505, Supply Chain Risk Management,  which assigns responsibilities and establishes  minimum criteria for the development and  deployment of supply chain risk management  capabilities for national security systems.  Also, NIST collaborated with over 3,000  stakeholders through the Software and  Supply Chain Assurance (SSCA) Forum  and email list service. The efort, initiated in  2003, is co-led by NIST, the Department of  Homeland Security (DHS), the Department  of Defense (DOD) and the U.S. General  Services Administration (GSA) and provides  a venue for government, industry, and  academic participants from around the world  to discuss cyber supply chain risks, efective  practices and mitigation strategies, tools and  technologies, and any gaps related to the  people, processes, or technologies involved.  • The goal of the ITL’s Usable Security and  Privacy project team is to provide guidance  for policymakers, system engineers and  security professionals so that they can make  better decisions that enhance the usability  of cybersecurity in their organizations:  The Usable Security and Privacy team  contributed usability chapters to SP 800-63,  Digital Identity Guidelines, marking the frst  time there were dedicated usability chapters  in this fagship NIST security publication. In  addition, the usability team also completed  a long-term operational phishing evaluation,  demonstrating the importance of individual  user context in explaining phishing email click  decisions.  • Method developed for efcient automated  testing of systems used in Artifcial  Intelligence (AI) applications:  NIST developed a method of automatically  testing and verifying rule-based systems  to a high degree of assurance. The method  uses a mathematical construct known as  a covering array to exhaustively test all  components of rules used in many classes of  artifcial intelligence applications, for a large  subset of such applications. The method was  • Final Draft of a NIST Special Publication  providing guidance on how to securely  confgure Apple OS X systems:  NIST developed this publication to assist  IT professionals in securing Apple OS X  10.10 desktop and laptop systems within  various environments. It provides detailed  information about the security features of OS  X 10.10 and security confguration guidelines.  The publication recommends and explains  tested, secure settings with the objective  of simplifying the administrative burden of  improving the security of OS X 10.10 systems  in three types of environments: Standalone,  Managed, and Specialized Security-Limited  Functionality.  • Began the integration of privacy into the  Risk Management Framework documents:  A July 2016 update to Ofce of Management  and Budget (OMB) Circular A-130 requires  federal agencies to apply the Risk  Management Framework to privacy programs  - managing privacy risk beyond compliance  with privacy laws, regulations and policies.  In alignment with this policy, the Privacy  Engineering Program in ITL has been working  to integrate privacy into the Risk Management  Framework documents, providing one unifed  security and privacy approach – as seen in  the initial draft of SP 800-53rev5 and the  discussion draft of SP 800-37rev2.  • Introduced concepts for privacy engineering  and risk management as the foundation  for the integration of privacy into the Risk  Management Framework documents:  The Privacy Engineering Program in ACD  published NISTIR 8062, An Introduction to  Privacy Engineering and Risk Management in  Federal Systems. This publication establishes  the basis for a common vocabulary  to facilitate better understanding and  communication of privacy risk within federal  systems, and the efective implementation  of privacy principles. It introduces two key  components to support the application of 8  privacy engineering and risk management:  NIST/ITL CYBERSECURITY PROGRAM ANNUAL REPORT 2017  privacy engineering objectives and a privacy  risk model. These concepts lay the foundation  for the integration of privacy into the Risk  Management Framework (as seen in the latest  revisions of SP 800-53 and SP 800-37).  • Comprehensive Security Guidance for  Virtualized Infrastructures and Contributions  to Standards Development:  A set of security recommendations for server  virtualization were updated in the publication  of SP 800-125A, Security Recommendations  for Hypervisor Deployment on Servers, by  including emerging use cases. NIST security  guidance for this technology now covers  hardware, hypervisor (the core server  virtualization software), virtual network  and management modules.  The active  participation of NIST in the editorial team  for the International Organization For  Standardization/International Electrotechnical  Commission (ISO/IEC) 21878, Security  guidelines for design and implementation  of virtualized servers, has advanced the  standard from a working draft in October  2016 to a Draft International Standard  (DIS) in October 2017. In the area of OS  virtualization, the potential solutions for  security countermeasures outlined in SP  800-190, Application Container Security  Guide, were examined, and security  assurance requirements for each solution  were developed to guide actual security  confgurations. These security assurance  requirements were published in NISTIR 8176,  Security Assurance Requirements for Linux  Application Container Deployments, for the  open source Linux platform where application  containers are ubiquitously developed and  deployed.  • Established the NIST Cybersecurity Program  for the Internet of Things (IoT):  ITL created a program for IoT cybersecurity  that supports the development and  application of standards, guidelines, and  related tools to improve IoT cybersecurity.  Program establishment included creating an  9  inventory of NIST-wide eforts related to IoT  cybersecurity, coordinating among  NIST IoT  eforts, and  convening a team of subject- matter experts to begin drafting guidance on  managing IoT cybersecurity and privacy risks.  • The IoT Program convened cross-sector  stakeholders to inform IoT cybersecurity  eforts:  The IoT Cybersecurity Program coordinated  outreach to a range of public and private- sector stakeholders to inform them of NIST’s  IoT cybersecurity work and collect feedback  to inform future work. This included sessions  at the Cybersecurity Framework Workshop in  2017, the Industrial Internet Consortium (IIC)  quarterly meeting, and planning a colloquium  with industry, government, and academic  participants.  • The National Initiative for Cybersecurity  Excellence (NICE) program provided  numerous communication channels and  maintained a visible high-level presence in  supporting its mission to the cybersecurity  workforce and education felds:  The NICE program published three  eNewsletters; launched an updated and  refreshed the NICE Website to better meet  the needs of the NICE Community and  visitors; produced 3 new one-page reports  and updated the content of three others;  produced two ITL Science Day posters;  established a LinkedIn presence and hashtag  for Tweets from the @NISTCyber twitter  account; developed a NICE Multimedia page;  participated in seven conference exhibit  displays; and hosted ten webinar sessions.  • The NICE Program also developed and  published two NIST publications to support  the Cybersecurity Workforce:  During FY 2017, the NICE Program published  NIST Special Publication 800-181, National  Initiative for Cybersecurity Education (NICE)  Cybersecurity Workforce Framework, and  the Draft NIST Interagency Report (NISTIR)  8193, National Initiative for Cybersecurity  Education (NICE) Framework Work Role  Capability Indicators: Indicators for Performing  Work Roles. The national need for a common  lexicon to describe and organize the  cybersecurity workforce and the requisite  ITL IMPLEMENTS THE FISMA ACTIvITIES |  FY 2017  knowledge, skills, and abilities (KSAs) led  to the creation of the NICE Cybersecurity  Workforce Framework (NICE Framework).  The NICE Framework defnes the spectrum  of cybersecurity work as well as tasks and for  over 50 common Work Roles. While the Work  Roles have made the NICE Framework easier  to associate with specifc positions, they do  not provide organizations with guidance on  how to determine if a cybersecurity worker  can perform a Work Role. NISTIR 8193 is  intended to help organizations address this  challenge by identifying capability indicators  or recommended education, certifcation,  training, experiential learning, and continuous  learning that could signal an increased ability  to perform a given Work Role.  • The NICE program provided strategic  outreach and engagement with stakeholders  throughout FY 2017:  The NICE Program increased its outreach  eforts to include new academic, industry,  and government organizations, including  international stakeholders through various  meetings and collaborative eforts including  the NICE Working Group and NICE  Interagency Coordinating Council.  • Seven NIST National Cybersecurity Center  of Excellence (NCCoE) Special Publications  (SP) 1800 Series Practice Guides (one  revised draft and six new drafts) were  issued, providing management, operational,  and technical security guidelines in topic  areas including:  Attribute Based Access Control, Domain  Name Systems-Based Email Security,  Situational Awareness for the Electric  Utilities, Securing Wireless Infusion Pumps in  Healthcare Delivery Organizations, Managing  Access Rights in the Financial Services  Sector, Data Integrity: Recovering from  Ransomware and Other Destructive Events,  and Derived Personal Identity Verifcation  (PIV) Credentials.  • The ITL Software Assurance and Quality  Program researched and improved how to  assess a tool’s ability to detect and identify  code problems in the Software Assurance  Metrics And Tool Evaluation (SAMATE)  program:  The SAMATE program has three primary  components: the Software Assurance  Reference Dataset (SARD), the Static Analysis  Tool Exposition (SATE), and the Bugs  Framework (BF). Mobile applications and  test cases used in former Static Analysis Tool  Expositions were added to SARD.  In 2017, the  sixth instance of SATE began.  • ITL’s Computer Forensics Team researched  ways to improve the methods for securely  acquiring, storing and analyzing digital  evidence quickly and efciently:  ITL promoted the efcient and efective  use of computer technology to investigate  crimes. The project team developed tools for  testing computer forensic software, including  test criteria and test sets. ITL also maintains  the National Software Reference Library  (NSRL) – a vast archive of published software  applications that is an important resource for  both criminal investigators and historians.  The NSRL published four releases of the  Reference Data Set (RDS) that continues to  be the premier software resource. The NSRL  was expanded to include mobile apps and to  include the profles obtained from installing  and exercising applications.  • Ongoing involvement and outreach support  among various programs:  ITL provided assistance to agencies and  the private sector through many outreach  programs, including the National Initiative for  Cybersecurity Education (NICE), the Federal  Information Systems Security Educators’  Association (FISSEA), and the Federal  Computer Security Managers’ Forum.  • Continued support and involvement of the  Information Security and Privacy Advisory  Board (ISPAB):  NIST solicited recommendations from the  Information Security and Privacy Advisory  Board (ISPAB) on draft standards and  guidelines regarding information security and  privacy issues. 10  NIST/ITL CYBERSECURITY PROGRAM ANNUAL REPORT 2017  • In support of FISMA activities, ITL  conducted workshops, awareness briefngs,  webinars, and various outreach to ITL  customers:  The ITL Cybersecurity Program hosted or  provided at least 55 diferent cybersecurity  events throughout FY 2017.  These outreach  activities were open to the public or for  federal agencies. These events covered various  Cybersecurity topics – to see the complete list  of these events, please see Appendix B at the  back of this Annual Report for further details.

Various ITL staf participate in many cybersecurity  standards’ activities either in leadership positions  or as editors and contributors, including the  American National Standards Institute (ANSI); the  International Organization for Standardization (ISO);  the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC);  the Biometric Application Programming Interface  (BioAPI) Consortium; the Bluetooth Special Interest  Group (SIG); the Bluetooth Security Expert Group  (BT-SEG); the International Telecommunications  Union - Telecommunication Standardization Sector  (ITU-T); various groups within the Institute of Electrical  and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) and the Internet  Engineering Task Force (IETF); the North American  Security Products Organization (NASPO); the Trusted  Computing Group (TCG); and Accredited Standards  Committee X9, Inc. (ASC X9, Inc.) (e.g., X9F – Data  & Information Security Subcommittee). Many of ITL’s  publications have been the basis for both national and  international standards projects.  Focus on ISO and ANSI Standardization (ISO/  IEC JTC1 SC27 IT Security)  The following paragraphs discuss ITL staf activities  in conjunction with the InterNational Committee for  Information Technology Standards (INCITS) Technical  Committee Cybersecurity 1 (CS1), where ITL’s Mr. Sal  Francomacaro serves as the CS1 Vice Chair. CS1 is the  U.S. counterpart for the ISO/IEC SC27 committee for  IT Security.  Figure 1: SDOs involved in Cybersecurity  13  ITL CYBERSECURITY PROGRAM AND PROJECTS  |  FY 2017  IT Security Techniques Standards –  ISO/IEC SC27  The ITL staf actively participate with JTC1/SC27  and its working groups to develop standards for  the protection of information and communications  technology (ICT). This includes generic methods,  techniques and guidelines to address both security  and privacy aspects, such as:  • Management of information and ICT  security; in particular, information security  management systems, security processes, and  security controls and services;  • Cryptographic and other security  mechanisms, including but not limited to,  mechanisms for protecting the accountability,  availability, integrity and confdentiality of  information;  • Security management support  documentation, including terminology and  guidelines as well as procedures for the  registration of security components;  • Security aspects of identity management,  biometrics and privacy;  • Conformance assessment, accreditation  and auditing requirements in the area of  information security management systems;  and  • Security evaluation criteria and methodology.  The ITL staf also engages in active liaison and  collaboration with appropriate bodies to ensure  the proper development and application of SC 27  standards and technical reports in relevant areas.  CONTACT:  Mr. Salvatore Francomacaro  (301) 975-6414  salfra@nist.gov  NIST Cybersecurity Framework –  International Standardization  The NIST/ITL staf actively participate with  JTC1/SC27 and its working groups to support  the NIST Cybersecurity Framework International  Standardizations strategy.  The main focus for FY 2017 was the development  of a Technical Specifcation based on ISO/IEC 27101 –  Guidelines for developing cybersecurity frameworks.  This Technical Specifcation (TS) represents the work  done by a U.S. group on NIST Cybersecurity Framework  and should serve as a guideline for other organizations  considering creating a new cybersecurity framework.  The NIST staf was also active in the defnition of  another ISO Technical Specifcation: Cybersecurity  Overview and Concepts. This TS should target any  user concerned with cybersecurity, but is particularly  targeted toward decision makers. It should cover,  among other things, what cybersecurity IS and IS NOT,  how it applies to existing standards, and how it fts in  with the other ISO/IEC 27000 series of standards.  The NIST staf will increase participation and efort  on these activities during FY 2018.  CONTACT:  Mr. Matt Barrett  (301) 975-6259  matthew.barrett@nist.gov  ISO Standardization of Security  Requirements for Cryptographic  Modules  ITL is also the principal editor, co-editor, and  contributor to many ISO/IEC documents by the ISO/  IEC International Organization for Standardization.  ITL’s contributions to the development of these  international standards help to create a strong  foundation for the adoption of and migration from  currently used national standards. In particular, this  adoption promotes international harmonization for  the implementation and testing of cryptographic  algorithms and modules, while accommodating  individual country preferences in the choice of  approved security functions.  ITL has contributed to the activities of ISO/IEC  JTC 1 SC/27, which published ISO/IEC 19790, Security  Requirements for Cryptographic Modules, on March  1, 2006, and ISO/IEC 24759, Test Requirements  for Cryptographic Modules, on July 1, 2008.

These  eforts bring consistent testing of cryptographic  modules to the global community by providing  ISO-equivalent standards representing Federal  Information Processing Standard (FIPS) 140-2,  Security Requirements for Cryptographic Modules  and Derived Test Requirements [DTR] for FIPS 140-2,  Security Requirements for Cryptographic Modules. Mr.  Randall Easter (CSD) continues as the principal editor  for these standards.  ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 27 Working Group (WG) 3  completed and published revisions, followed with  updated corrections, of ISO/IEC 19790:2006 and  ISO/IEC 24759:2008. The second revision of ISO/  IEC 19790 was published on August 15, 2012. The  second revision of ISO/IEC 24759 was published on  January 31, 2014 and the third revision was published  March 2017. Both ISO/IEC standards are available  through the American National Standards Institute  (ANSI) (see: http://webstore.ansi.org/RecordDetail.  aspx?sku=ISO%2FIEC+19790%3A2012). The two  ISO/IEC revisions were developed with international  support and the collaboration of governments,  industry and academia.  The revision of ISO/IEC 19790:2012 addresses  new security areas, such as defned software module  boundaries, degraded modes of operation, trusted  channels, two-factor authentication, software security,  mitigation of fault induction and side-channel attacks,  operational self-tests for algorithms, and lifecycle  assurance from design to end-of-life.  Figure 2 is a chart of the ISO/IEC standards, as  explained above, in which CSD has played a part  during the development process.  In addition to the aforementioned standards,  International Standards ISO/IEC 17825, Testing  methods for the mitigation of non-invasive attack  classes against cryptographic modules, was published  on January 15, 2016 and ISO/IEC 18367, Cryptographic  algorithms and security mechanisms conformance  testing, was published on December 15, 2016. Mr.  Easter was the editor of both standards.  International Standard ISO/IEC 17825 specifes  the non-invasive attack mitigation test metrics  for determining conformance to the requirements  specifed in ISO/IEC 19790 for Security Levels 3 and  4. The test metrics are associated with the security  functions specifed in ISO/IEC 19790. Testing will  be conducted at the defned boundary of the  cryptographic module and using Input/Output (I/O)  available at the defned boundary.  Figure 2: Cryptographic Module Testing – ISO Standards 15  http://webstore.ansi.org/RecordDetail.aspx?sku=ISO%2FIEC+19790%3A2012 http://webstore.ansi.org/RecordDetail.aspx?sku=ISO%2FIEC+19790%3A2012  ITL CYBERSECURITY PROGRAM AND PROJECTS  |  FY 2017  International Standard ISO/IEC 18367 describes  conformance testing methods for cryptographic  algorithms and security mechanisms. Conformance  testing assures that an implementation of a  cryptographic algorithm or security mechanism is  correct whether implemented in hardware, software  or frmware. It also confrms that it runs correctly  in a specifc operating environment. Testing may  consist of known-answer or Monte Carlo testing,  or a combination of test methods. Testing may be  performed on the actual implementation or modeled  in a simulation environment.  The test methods used by testing laboratories to  test whether the cryptographic module conforms to  the requirements specifed in ISO/IEC 19790 and the  test metrics specifed in this International Standard  for each of the associated security functions specifed  in ISO/IEC 19790 are specifed in ISO/IEC 24759. The  test approach employed in this International Standard  is an efcient “push-button” approach: the tests are  technically sound, repeatable and have moderate  costs.

GICS enables Personal Identity Verifcation (PIV),  PIV-Interoperable (PIV-I) and Common Access Card  (CAC) applications, and others, to be built from a  single platform. GICS defnes an open platform where  identity applications can be instantiated, deployed,  and used in an interoperable way between the  credential issuers and credential users that aligns with  the last revision of the NIST SP 800-73-4, Interfaces  for Personal Identity Verifcation, (PIV) specifcations.  During FY 2017, the ITL staf:  • Contributed to the publication of several  revisions of the ISO/IEC 7816 family of  standards (Identifcation cards - Integrated  circuit cards), which are all relevant to FIPS  201, Personal Identity Verifcation (PIV)  of Federal Employees and Contractors,  specifcations;  16  https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/Cryptographic-Module-Validation-Program https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/Cryptographic-Module-Validation-Program mailto:randall.easter@nist.gov mailto:serban.gavrila@nist.gov mailto:david.ferraiolo@nist.gov  NIST/ITL CYBERSECURITY PROGRAM ANNUAL REPORT 2017  • Pursued the standardization and  harmonization of identity standards that were  developed in the U.S.;  • Developed requirements and identifed  standards gaps for Mobile Driving Licenses;  • Actively participated in the development of a  standards for Mobile Driving Licenses;  • Enhanced the Machine-Readable Travel  Documents (ePassport) data model to  address privacy and security concerns; and  • Contributed to the development of a standard  for privacy-enhanced security protocols for  secure elements.  The ITL staf will continue to actively support  relevant ID management standard initiatives, such as  ISO/IEC 19286, Integrated circuit card (ICC) Privacy- enhancing protocols and services, and ISO/IEC 18328,  ICC managed devices.  Web Authentication/FIDO: ITL participates in the  development of online authentication specifcations.  These specifcations are developed by the Fast  Identities Online (FIDO) alliance, which is a consortium  of private organizations. ITL also participates in  the development of similar specifcations (called  WebAuthn) for web browsers that are being developed  by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). Both the  FIDO and WebAuthn specifcations enable relying  parties to create cryptographic tokens on the end- user’s device and subsequently use this cryptographic  token to authenticate the end user. These specifcations  provide multi-factor authentication directives, and  they are designed to mitigate common threat vectors  for Internet communications, such as phishing, man- in-the-middle, and replay attacks.  ePassport: ITL participates in the development  of an ISO/IEC standard (ISO/IEC 7501) for electronic  Passports. Specifcally, ITL is contributing to the  development of passport data structure and its access  control. ITL reviews and comments on authentication  protocols that are developed to ensure strong user  authentication and to protect personally identifable  passport data.  Mobile Driver License: ITL is also participating  in the development of an ISO standard (ISO/IEC  18013) for an International Mobile Driver License (DL).  ITL gathered and discussed functional and security  requirements for Mobile DLs, and is now developing  two models: ofine and online. Once these models are  fully defned, ITL plans to write technical specifcations  for each model.

The goal in these eforts is to promote a vibrant  market of internationally viable identity services and  advance the secure exchange of digital identities  while protecting the privacy of the subjects of those  identities for cross-border transactions and mutual  recognition. While primarily focused on developing a  framework that would facilitate the establishment of  a common set of requirements and standards across  the three national programs, there was increasing  interest from other national programs and industry  in the work products and methodologies developed  by this collaborative work. As a result, the group  provided this work to the international community as  a series of aligned joint contributions for international  standardization.  The TIG contributions, in collaboration with their  British and Canadian partners, were focused on  establishing a synchronized core set of international  identity management standards within the scope of  the activities of ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 27/WG 5, which  oversees the development of international standards  for identity management and privacy.

These included  participation in a new blockchain study group  sponsored by the American Standards Committee  X9, the fnancial services committee of the American  National Standards Institute (ANSI), and continued  work in the International Standards Organization  (ISO) Technical Committee (TC) for Blockchains  and Distributed Ledger Technologies (ISO/TC 307).  Established in 2016, the initial objectives of ISO/TC 307  include defning key terms and concepts, exploring  reference architectures, investigating use cases, and  identifying identity and privacy implications within  blockchain technologies and architectures. NIST has  been participating in these activities via the national  mirror committee within the InterNational Committee  for Information Technology Standards (INCITS). ISO/  TC 307 will meet in November 2017, where the reports  on these topics will be reviewed and new work will be  established.

Focus was on the architecture, vocabulary, and  recently, edge computing. In addition to working on  standards related to these areas, NIST staf member  Eric Simmon is the chair of the IIC commenting  working group for reviewing the IEEE p2413 draft  standard and is the liaison between ISO/IEC SC41-  ISO/IEC SC38 (cloud computing).  The NIST staf has also participated to the activities  in ISO/IEC SC27 relative to IoT Security. This activity  will be further developed during FY 2018.

These participants include the Ofce  of Management and Budget (OMB) E-Gov Ofce and  Ofce of Information and Regulatory Afairs, the  federal Chief Information Ofcers (CIO) Council, the  Interagency Council on Standards Policy (ICSP), and  the General Services Administration (GSA) Ofce of  Government-wide Policy. Our goal in chairing the  Standards Working Group is to solicit requirements  from federal agencies, fnd the appropriate voluntary  standards committee that is addressing these  requirements and encourage participation to ensure  the government requirements are being adequately  met. Where standards are needed, ITL works  closely with U.S. industry, standards development  organizations, other government agencies, and  leaders in the global standards community to develop  standards that will support secure cloud computing.  ITL participation helps to ensure the alignment  of NIST standards with those of ISO/IEC JTC 1 sub- committees, such as SC 27 IT Security techniques,  SC 38 Cloud Computing and Distributed Platforms,  and their U.S. counterparts, ANSI/ INCITS Cyber  Security 1 (CS 1) and Cloud 38. The large number of  standards being developed in SC 27 covering areas  such as security, cryptography, privacy, supply chain,  personally identifable information (PII) processing  or virtualization security, harmonize with many cloud  computing standards being developed by these  subcommittees.  The focus of implementing cloud computing is  even more critical since the White House released  an IT Modernization Report in September 2017 that  includes recommendations for agencies to take  steps to secure and modernize federal IT networks.  Those steps for modernizing and consolidating  networks point to cloud computing, modernization of  government-hosted applications, and better security  for legacy systems. Federal modernization eforts,  such as those connected with the Modernizing  Government Technology Act, may further enable  agencies to accelerate investments in cloud and other  new technologies.  Ms. Annie Sokol is a member of ITL’s Cloud  Computing team and is the CSD representative in  the standards development program. ITL provides  technical and editorial representation in the  development of national and international standards  in both SC 27 and SC 38. Ms. Sokol is the co-editor  of ISO/IEC 19941, Information technology–Cloud  computing–Interoperability and portability, which  is expected to be published by the end of 2017.  The document is intended to establish a common  understanding of cloud computing interoperability  and portability. Both interoperability and portability  ofer more choices to cloud users by limiting the  efects of being locked-in to any cloud service or cloud  service provider. ISO/IEC 19941 joins many published  cloud computing standards that were developed from  NIST publications, such as:  • ISO/IEC 17788, Information technology --  Cloud computing -- Overview and vocabulary;  • ISO/IEC 17789, Information technology --  Cloud computing -- Reference architecture;  and,  • ISO/IEC 19086, Information technology --  Cloud computing -- Service level agreement  (SLA) framework.

This  EO directed NIST to work with stakeholders to develop  a voluntary framework – based on existing standards,  guidelines, and practices − for reducing cybersecurity  risks to critical infrastructures.  The Cybersecurity Framework that was  developed provides a prioritized, fexible, repeatable,  performance-based, and cost-efective approach to  help critical infrastructure owners and operators—as 19  mailto:annie.sokol@nist.gov  ITL CYBERSECURITY PROGRAM AND PROJECTS  |  FY 2017  well as other interested entities—identify, assess, and  manage cybersecurity-related risk while protecting  business confdentiality, individual privacy, and civil  liberties.  In FY 2017, NIST continued to work with a diverse  stakeholder community to support the use and  understanding of the Cybersecurity Framework. This  process included:  • Publication of a draft Framework 1.1 to clarify,  refne, and enhance the Cybersecurity  Framework, drawing upon comments received  from a public review process launched in  January 2017;  • Conducting a public workshop at NIST in  Gaithersburg, MD to gather input about the  current use of the Framework and feedback  regarding the initial public draft;  • Releasing the 1.0 version of the Baldrige  Cybersecurity Excellence Builder, a self- assessment tool to help organizations  better understand the efectiveness of their  cybersecurity risk-management eforts;  • Updates to the Framework website with a  catalog of industry resources, upcoming NIST  speaking events, and an extensive frequently- asked-question knowledge base;  • Provision of outreach for small- and medium- sized businesses (SMBs), including guidance  provided by the Applied Cybersecurity  Division (ACD) in NIST Interagency Report  (NISTIR) 7621 Rev. 1, Small Business  Information Security: The Fundamentals;  • Coordinating with critical infrastructure  owners and operators, regulators, and other  industry organizations through a variety of  meetings and industry events to ensure the  understanding and use of the Framework;  • Analyzing various industry work products  (such as mapping documents) for Framework  correctness;  • Consulting with state and local governments,  and the governments of other nations  regarding their alignment with both the  principles and the cybersecurity outcomes of  the Framework;  • Consulting with international organizations  and standards bodies to demonstrate and  ensure continued alignment with voluntary  international standards; and  • Working with both industry and regulatory  organizations to apply the Framework in  ways that bring efciencies to the regulatory  process.  Since the release of the Framework, NIST’s primary  goal has been to raise awareness of the Framework  and encourage its use as a tool to help industry  sectors and organizations manage cybersecurity risks.  NIST has strengthened its collaboration with critical  infrastructure owners and operators, industry leaders,  government partners, and other stakeholders—  building on previous years’ interactions that were  crucial to the Framework’s development.  In May 2017, Executive Order 13800 was released,  directing federal agency heads to use the Framework  to manage agencies’ cybersecurity risk. NIST released  draft NISTIR 8170, The Cybersecurity Framework:  Implementation Guidance for Federal Agencies, to  provide information on how Federal agencies can use  the Cybersecurity Framework—and in particular, how  the Risk Management Framework and Cybersecurity  Framework work together to help agencies  develop, implement, and continuously improve their  information security programs.  In FY 2018, NIST will continue to conduct  stakeholder outreach and will work collaboratively  to further understand stakeholder needs regarding  tools and resources to enable more efective use  of the Framework. Version 1.1 of the Framework is  expected to be published, and NIST will continue to  identify ways for the Framework to contribute to risk  management initiatives.

During FY 2017, the ITL FISMA Implementation  project continued to strengthen collaboration through  the Joint Task Force (JTF) Transformation Initiative,  which includes the Department of Defense (DoD),  the Intelligence Community (IC), the Committee on  National Security Systems (CNSS), and various federal  agencies. The JTF partners continue to develop and  update key cybersecurity guidelines for protecting  federal information and information systems as  part of the Unifed Information Security Framework.  Previously, the JTF developed common security  guidance in the critical areas of security controls  for information systems and organizations, security  assessment procedures to demonstrate security  control efectiveness, security authorizations for risk  acceptance decisions, and continuous monitoring  activities to ensure that decision makers receive the  most up-to-date information on the security state of  their information systems. In addition, ITL continued  to work with the Department of Homeland Security  (DHS) to develop guidelines for automation support  for security control assessments on a security  capability basis and in accordance with the NIST RMF  as well as on developing guidance and a security  controls overlay to protect federal high value assets.  In FY 2017, the ITL FISMA Team worked on the  following initiatives:  • System Security Engineering Initiative:  The fnal version of Special Publication (SP)  800-160, Systems Security Engineering:  Considerations for a Multidisciplinary  Approach in the Engineering of Trustworthy  Secure Systems, was published to address  the engineering-driven actions necessary  to develop more defensible and survivable  systems—including the components that  compose and the services that depend on  those systems. To ensure that the publication  provides the utmost clarity and focus for  our customers, several of the supporting  appendices from the second public draft are  being recast into their own publications. SP  800-160 is the fagship publication for the  NIST Systems Security Engineering Initiative.  NIST publications specifcally addressing  several key systems security engineering  considerations (i.e., resilience, software  assurance, and hardware assurance) will be  developed and published, beginning in 2018.  Additionally, the interaction of the NIST RMF  with the life cycle processes in SP 800-160,  will be described in future updates to existing  RMF standards and guidelines.  • Risk Management Guidelines: Work  continued on SP 800-53 Revision 5, Security  and Privacy Controls for Information Systems  and Organizations. The initial public draft  was published after collaboration with a  federal interagency working group, the OMB,  NIST, other agency privacy professionals,  and our JTF partners. SP 800-53 provides  organizations with the security and privacy  controls necessary to appropriately strengthen  their systems and the environments in  which those systems operate, and provides  a process for selecting the appropriate  controls, which contributes to systems that  are resilient in the face of attacks and other  threats and protect an individual’s privacy.  The FISMA Team, in conjunction with the  same group of collaborators, also published  a discussion draft of SP 800-37 Revision 2,  Risk Management Framework for Information  Systems and Organizations. SP 800-37  Revision 2 provides a closer link between risk 21  https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/Risk-Management https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/Risk-Management  ITL CYBERSECURITY PROGRAM AND PROJECTS  |  FY 2017  management processes and activities at the  executive level of the organization, with risk  management activities at the system and  operational level; institutionalizes enterprise- wide risk management preparatory activities  to facilitate a more efcient and cost- efective execution of the Risk Management  Framework at the system and operational  level; demonstrates how the Cybersecurity  Framework can be implemented using the  established Risk Management Framework  processes; and integrates privacy concepts  into the Risk Management Framework. The  implementation of SP 800-53, SP 800-37, and  SP 800-137, Information Security Continuous  Monitoring for Federal Information Systems  and Organizations, provides organizations  with near real-time information that is  essential for senior leaders making ongoing  risk-based decisions afecting their critical  missions and business functions.  • FISMA Outreach Activity to Public and  Private-Sector Organizations: Cybersecurity  outreach briefngs were conducted and  support was provided to all levels of private- sector organizations and government  (including federal, state and local entities) on  multiple information security topics of interest.  These included, for example, an efective  implementation of the NIST RMF, contingency  planning, interconnection security  agreements, security-focused confguration  management, and information security for  small businesses. In addition, the ITL FISMA  Team responded to hundreds of inquiries from  customers, served on cybersecurity advisory  panels, conducted outreach activities with  academic institutions, provided information on  NIST’s security standards and guidelines, and  explored new areas of cybersecurity research  and development.  • Collaboration with JTF partners and  other federal organizations: The FISMA  Team worked closely with JTF partners to  ensure that the fve JTF publications remain  current, and to designate additional Special  Publications as JTF guidance. The fve JTF  publications are:  1. SP 800-30, Guide for Conducting Risk  Assessments;  2. SP 800-37, Guide for Applying the Risk  Management Framework to Federal  Information Systems: a Security Life Cycle  Approach;  3. SP 800-39, Managing Information  Security Risk: Organization, Mission, and  Information System View;  4. SP 800-53, Security and Privacy Controls  for Federal Information Systems and  Organizations; and  5. SP 800-53A, Assessing Security and  Privacy Controls in Federal Information  Systems and Organizations: Building  Efective Assessment Plans.  The FISMA Team also collaborated with DoD,  the IC, DHS, the National Archives and Records  Administration (NARA), the Federal Emergency  Management Agency (FEMA), the Government  Accountability Ofce (GAO), the OMB, the General  Services Administration (GSA), the Small Business  Administration (SBA), and the Inspectors General  (IGs) on multiple projects to ensure consistency with  FISMA-related guidance and to protect information in  a way that is commensurate with risk. In addition, the  FISMA Team served as co-chairs on the CNSS working  groups.  In FY 2017, the FISMA Team completed the  following activities:  • Published the fnal version of SP 800-160,  Systems Security Engineering: Considerations  for a Multidisciplinary Approach in the  Engineering of Trustworthy Secure Systems;  • Published the initial public draft of SP 800-53  Revision 5, Security and Privacy Controls for  Systems and Organizations;  • Published the discussion draft of SP 800-37  Revision 2, Risk Management Framework for  Federal Information Systems: A System Life  Cycle Approach for Security and Privacy;  • Published the fnal version of SP 800-171  Revision 1, Protecting Controlled Unclassifed 22  NIST/ITL CYBERSECURITY PROGRAM ANNUAL REPORT 2017  Information in Nonfederal Information Systems  and Organizations, to provide guidance  to federal agencies for the protection of  Controlled Unclassifed Information when such  information is resident in nonfederal systems  and organizations;  • Published fnal versions of NIST Interagency  Report (NISTIR) 8011, Automation Support for  Ongoing Assessments, Volume 1 - Overview,  and Volume 2 - Hardware Asset Management,  and adjudicated public comments in  partnership with DHS;  • Published the fnal version of An Introduction  to Information Security;  • Continued the development of a web  application to automate the process for  updating SP 800-53 in order to keep it as  current and relevant as possible;  • Continued the development of SP 800- 60, Revision 2, Guide for Mapping Types  of Information and Information Systems to  Security Categories, in partnership with the  National Archives and Records Administration  (NARA);  • Continued the development of the initial  public draft of SP 800-18 Revision 2, Guide for  Developing System Security and Privacy Plans;  and  • Continued the development of the  initial public draft of SP 800-47 Revision  1, Information Exchange and System  Connections.  In FY 2018, the FISMA Team intends to:  • Continue work on SP 800-160 companion  publications;  • Finalize and publish the fnal version of SP  800-53 Revision 5, Security and Privacy  Controls for Information Systems and  Organizations;  • Finalize and publish the fnal version of  SP 800-37 Revision 2, Risk Management  Framework for Federal Information Systems:  A System Life Cycle Approach for Security and  Privacy;  • Complete the development of and  operationalize the web application for the  automated support of SP 800-53 updates and  the public comment process;  • Continue the collaboration with DHS to  develop and publish additional NISTIR 8011  volumes;  • Finalize and publish the initial public draft  of SP 800-60 Revision 2, Guide for Mapping  Types of Information and Information Systems  to Security Categories, in partnership with  NARA and OMB;  • Publish the initial public draft and fnal version  of SP 800-53A, Assessing Security and  Privacy Controls in Information Systems and  Organizations;  • Publish the initial public draft and fnal version  of SP 800-171A, Assessing Security Controls in  Nonfederal Systems;  • Continue the development of SP 800-18  Revision 2, Guide for Developing System  Security and Privacy Plans;  • Finalize and publish SP 800-47 Revision  1, Information Exchange and System  Connections;  • Update the RMF online course to Hypertext  Markup Language version 5 (HTML5) and  verify consistency with SP 800-37 Revision 2;  • Expand cybersecurity outreach to include  additional state, local, and tribal governments,  as well as private-sector organizations and  academic institutions;  • Continue to support federal agencies in the  efective implementation of the RMF; and  • Continue the collaboration with JTF partners  and other federal organizations.

Privacy Engineering Program  The NIST Privacy Engineering Program (PEP)  supports the development of trustworthy information  systems by applying measurement science and system  engineering principles to the creation of frameworks,  risk models, guidance, tools, and standards that  protect privacy and, by extension, civil liberties.  In FY 2017, the PEP focused on advancing  the development of privacy engineering and risk  management processes and the deployment  of privacy-enhancing technologies (as well as  positioning NIST as a leader in privacy research).  Many of the PEP’s eforts in FY 2017 were fueled  by the OMB’s July 2016 update to Circular  A-130, which emphasized federal agencies’  responsibilities to manage privacy risk, not just  compliance risk, and now requires them to apply the  NIST Risk Management Framework to their privacy  programs.  Advancement of Privacy Engineering and Risk  Management  In January 2017, the PEP reached a major  milestone in advancing the development of privacy  engineering and risk management processes with the  fnalization of NISTIR 8062, An Introduction to Privacy  Engineering and Risk Management in Federal Systems  (see https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.IR.8062). NISTIR  8062 introduces the concept of applying systems  engineering practices to privacy and provides a  new model for conducting privacy risk assessments  on federal systems. It also presents the PEP’s initial  roadmap (See Figure 3) for guidance development to  help agencies more efectively meet new obligations  under the revised Circular A-130.  In FY 2017, the PEP team collaborated with  internal and external partners to successfully integrate  privacy requirements and considerations into SP 800- 63-3, Digital Identity Guidelines. The PEP team also  collaborated to integrate privacy into the draft revisions  of SPs 800-53, Revision 5, Security and Privacy  Controls for Information Systems and Organizations,  and 800-37, Revision 2, Risk Management Framework  for Information Systems and Organizations, building  the foundation of making privacy and security equal  Figure 3: PEP guidance roadmap for integrating privacy risk management into NIST SPs, featuring  integrations underway during FY 2017 (highlighted in green).  24  mailto:sec-cert@nist.gov https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.IR.8062 mailto:kelley.dempsey@nist.gov mailto:jody.jacobs@nist.gov mailto:nedim.goren@nist.gov mailto:victoria.pillitteri@nist.gov mailto:ron.ross@nist.gov  NIST/ITL CYBERSECURITY PROGRAM ANNUAL REPORT 2017  quality attributes in trustworthy systems. The PEP  team also contributed privacy concepts to the Trusted  Identities Group (TIG) measurement science efort,  draft NISTIR 8112, Attribute Metadata.  The PEP team also contributed to ongoing  standards and framework development eforts in  the International Organization for Standardization  (ISO), Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers  (IEEE), and the Fast Identity Online (FIDO) Alliance.  Specifcally, the PEP team worked on ISO/IEC 27552,  which is a privacy-focused sector-specifc extension  of  the information security-focused ISO/IEC 27001,  and ISO/IEC 27550, a technical report on privacy  engineering. The PEP team also supported the  development of IEEE P7002, an efort in its early  stages that also addresses privacy engineering. The  PEP team also engaged with FIDO to help develop  privacy-enhancing authentication specifcations.  Continuing the ongoing series of NIST workshops  on privacy engineering and risk management,  building of the concepts introduced in NISTIR 8062,  the PEP team hosted the June 2017 workshop,  “Privacy Risk Assessment: A Prerequisite for Privacy  Risk Management” (see https://www.nist.gov/news- events/events/2017/06/privacy-risk-assessment- prerequisite-privacy-risk-management). Feedback  received included the need for further integration of  privacy into risk management and security guidance,  a privacy-specifc risk assessment model, and a toolset  to manage privacy risk. These takeaways aligned well  with the PEP team’s ongoing eforts and goals for  future work.  In support of a privacy-specifc risk assessment  tool, the PEP team continued socializing the use of  its Privacy Risk Assessment Methodology (PRAM)  inside and outside the Federal Government. As of  FY 2017, more than 30 public- and private-sector  organizations have used or are using the PRAM,  including participants in NIST’s trusted identities  pilots and a few federal agencies.  The PEP team also collaborated on projects at the  National Cybersecurity Center of Excellence (NCCoE),  including the Privacy-Enhancing Identity Federation  building block, which demonstrates the use of the  NIST privacy engineering objectives (see https://  nccoe.nist.gov/projects/building-blocks/privacy- enhanced-identity-brokers).  NIST Leadership in Privacy  The PEP team built upon NIST’s leadership role  in privacy by serving in leadership positions and  contributing to privacy expertise organizations across  the public and private sectors. These leadership  positions included: the chair of the Federal Privacy  Council’s Risk Management Task Force and co-chair of  the Networking and Information Technology Research  and Development (NITRD) Program’s Privacy  Research and Development (R&D) Interagency  Working Group. The PEP team also participated in the  Internet Policy Task Force’s Privacy Working Group,  the FIDO Alliance’s Privacy and Public Policy Working  Group, and the Identity Ecosystem Steering Group.  Looking Forward  In FY 2018, the PEP team will continue developing  privacy risk management guidance for agencies,  including fnalizing SP 800-53 Revision 5, and SP  800-37 Revision 2. The PEP team will also collaborate  with internal and external stakeholders to kick of  the integration of privacy guidance into SP 800-53A  Revision 5, Assessing Security and Privacy Controls  in Federal Information Systems and Organizations,  and implement the provisions of other documents  laid out in the guidance roadmap. The PEP team will  continue supporting the development of international  standards focused on privacy engineering and risk  management.  The PEP team will place a greater focus on  its goal of advancing the deployment of privacy- enhancing technologies. The PEP team has already  begun exploring whether stakeholders see a need  for an online space where collaborators can discuss,  learn about, and improve upon tools, solutions, and  processes that support privacy engineering and  risk management. The PEP team will also explore  the management of privacy risk in leading-edge  domains, such as the internet of things (IoT) and  artifcial intelligence (AI). Specifcally, the PEP team  will collaborate with NIST’s Cybersecurity for the IoT  program to tackle IoT-specifc privacy challenges  through workshops and guidance.  The PEP team will continue to seek leadership  opportunities in public- and private-sector organizations  to strengthen NIST’s position as a leader in privacy.  Finally, the PEP team will continue working with a  25  https://www.nist.gov/news-events/events/2017/06/privacy-risk-assessment-prerequisite-privacy-risk-management https://www.nist.gov/news-events/events/2017/06/privacy-risk-assessment-prerequisite-privacy-risk-management https://www.nist.gov/news-events/events/2017/06/privacy-risk-assessment-prerequisite-privacy-risk-management https://nccoe.nist.gov/projects/building-blocks/privacy-enhanced-identity-brokers https://nccoe.nist.gov/projects/building-blocks/privacy-enhanced-identity-brokers https://nccoe.nist.gov/projects/building-blocks/privacy-enhanced-identity-brokers  ITL CYBERSECURITY PROGRAM AND PROJECTS  |  FY 2017  variety of organizations to manage privacy risk using  the PRAM, such as using it in the NCCoE’s Mobile  Device Security building block.

This ecosystem is composed of  assorted entities with multiple tiers of outsourcing,  global distribution routes, diverse technologies, and  varying laws, policies, procedures, and practices, all of  which interact throughout the life cycle of a system.  Factors that allow for low-cost products, rapid  innovation, and other benefts also increase the risk  that the supply chain may be compromised in a way  that results in risks to the end user and reduce the  overall competitiveness of U.S. companies.  Cyber Supply Chain Risk Management (C-SCRM)  lies at the intersection of information security, supply  chain management, and enterprise risk management  (Figure 4); it is the process of identifying, assessing,  and mitigating the risks associated with the distributed  and interconnected nature of IT/OT product and  service supply chains. C-SCRM covers the entire life  cycle of a system (including design, development,  maintenance, and destruction), as supply chain threats  and vulnerabilities may intentionally or unintentionally  compromise an IT/OT product or service at any  stage. These cyber supply chain risks may include  the use of counterfeits, unauthorized production,  tampering, theft, and insertion of malicious software  and hardware, as well as poor manufacturing and  development practices. As shown in Figure 5, C-SCRM  is concerned with and involves a range of subjects,  including safety, integrity, quality, reliability, and  others, all within an overall environment of awareness.  Figure 5: C-SCRM Aspects  In FY 2017, NIST drafted NISTIR 8179, Criticality  Analysis Process Model, a method for identifying  and prioritizing IT/OT systems and components. This  model is intended to increase an organization’s ability  to make cost-efective risk decisions by determining  the systems and components that have the most  impact on the organization and that would potentially  cause the most harm if compromised. Figure 6 shows  an overview of the model, which includes separate  analyses at the program, system, and component  level, and then a trace-back exercise to complete the  analysis. NIST will fnalize this publication in FY 2018  and will begin to research and write guidance that  builds on this model to identify critical suppliers and  service providers.  26  https://www.nist.gov/itl/privacy-engineering mailto:privacyeng@nist.gov mailto:kaitlin.boeckl@nist.gov mailto:ellen.nadeau@nist.gov mailto:naomi.lefkovitz@nist.gov  NIST/ITL CYBERSECURITY PROGRAM ANNUAL REPORT 2017  .

Trace back  Figure 6: Criticality Analysis Process Overview  During 2017, NIST continued to research the state of  C-SCRM in both the public and private sectors, related  standards and initiatives, efective practices, and  metrics. NIST joined with the GSA and the University  of Maryland under a contract and grant awarded in  FY 2016 to conduct cyber analytics research on the  efectiveness of various risk management practices.  The efort neared conclusion in FY 2017 and found  correlations between certain practices and publicly  disclosed data breaches. A report on the research will  be published in FY 2018.  Similarly, NIST began research in FY 2017  to identify metrics that are currently used in  organizations to measure information security risks.  This research included a review of over 200 published  standards, academic papers, organizational white- papers, and other documents and interviews with a  dozen industry experts on the state of metrics in this  feld. The research will be continued and published in  FY 2018.  NIST continued to co-chair a working group  with the DoD to revise CNSSD 505, Supply Chain  Risk Management, which assigns responsibilities and  establishes minimum criteria for the development  and deployment of supply chain risk management  capabilities for national security systems. In FY 2017,  the group completed the revision of CNSSD 505 and  developed a self-assessment tool to help agencies  measure their capabilities and compare those  capabilities to those of other agencies.  NIST also sponsored the Software and Supply  Chain Assurance (SSCA) Forum and Working Groups,  the purpose of which is to bring together a stakeholder  community of government, industry, and academic  experts in this feld. Meetings are held three to four  times a year and cover a variety of subjects of interest  to attendees (see the website at https://csrc.nist.gov/  scrm/ssca).  NIST began working in FY 2017 to integrate  C-SCRM into existing risk management programs and  processes. The draft Cybersecurity Framework v1.1  and Draft SP 800-53 Revision 5 were both updated  to better include up-to-date C-SCRM guidance. In  FY 2018, NIST will continue this work by including  or updating existing C-SCRM concepts in other  publications as they are developed.  27  https://csrc.nist.gov/scrm/ssca https://csrc.nist.gov/scrm/ssca  ITL CYBERSECURITY PROGRAM AND PROJECTS  |  FY 2017  In FY 2018, NIST will continue to collaborate with  stakeholders in government, industry, and academia  to conduct research, produce needed standards and  guidance, and seek opportunities to create greater  awareness across all sectors and types and sizes of  organizations. NIST will:  • Update SP 800-161 based on the fnal  publication of SP 800-53 Revision 5,  • Continue developing industry supply chain  risk management case studies,  • Develop a draft NISTIR on SCRM “principles”,  • Develop a NISTIR on Supply Chain  Interdependency Analysis, and  • Continue research and work on metrics and  cyber risk analytics.

The Software and Supply Chain Assurance  (SSCA) Forum provides a venue for government,  industry, and academic participants from around  the world to share their knowledge and expertise  regarding cyber supply chain risks, efective practices  and mitigation strategies, tools and technologies,  and any gaps related to the people, processes, or  technologies involved.  The efort, initiated in 2003, is co-led by NIST,  DHS, DoD and GSA, and serves approximately 3,000  stakeholders. Participants represent a diverse group  of career professionals, including government ofcials,  chief information security ofcers, those in academia  with cybersecurity and supply chain specialties,  system administrators, engineers, consultants,  vendors, software developers, managers, analysts,  specialists in IT and cybersecurity, and many more  felds. The SSCA Forum meets two to three times per  year and is free and open to all interested participants,  both nationally and internationally.  While the general intent is to share information,  the SSCA Forum also ofers government and  private-sector participants an opportunity to openly  collaborate by presenting and receiving feedback on  current and potential future work. Most events are two  to three days long and contain a mixture of discussion  and presentation. To encourage open interaction,  SSCA Forum meetings operate under the Chatham  House Rule, meaning “participants are free to use  the information received, but neither the identity nor  the afliation of the speaker(s), nor that of any other  participant, may be revealed,” though most speakers  allow NIST to post their presentations.  The SSCA Forum also maintains an extensive  email subscription service. To receive information  about upcoming meetings and related publications  and activities, please sign up for the SSCA Forum  mailing list, operated by NIST, by sending a blank  email to sw.assurance-join@nist.gov.

S\\, •  BIOMETRIC STANDARDS AND  ASSOCIATED CONFORMITY  ASSESSMENT TESTING TOOLS  ITL supports the development of biometric  conformance testing methodology standards and  other conformity assessment eforts through active  technical participation in the development of these  standards and the development of associated  conformance test software, architectures and test  suites, collectively known as Biometric Conformance  Test Software (BioCTS). These test tools are developed  to promote the adoption of these standards and  to support users, product developers, and testing  labs that require conformance to selected biometric  standards. ITL contributes to the development of  biometric standards and participates in the INCITS  Technical Committee M1 – Biometrics and related  subcommittees and in ISO/IEC Joint Technical  Committee (JTC) 1 Subcommittee (SC) 37 – Biometrics  standards bodies.  In early 2017, a suite of BioCTS applications was  released to support user-defned requirements and  profles for ANSI/NIST-ITL (AN-ITL) specifcations.  These applications make use of confguration fles to  dynamically generate parsing rules and conformance  requirements for nearly any version or profle of the  AN-ITL standard. The confguration fles utilize an  Extensible Markup Language (XML)-based format  called ANSI/NIST-ITL Machine Readable Tables (MRTs)  (see Figure 7 for an example output). The BioCTS AN- ITL applications that use MRTs are collectively referred  to as BioCTS AN MRT.  The development of BioCTS applications  traditionally relied on the publication of Conformance  Testing Methodology (CTM) documentation, which  specifed the test assertions required to assess  conformance to requirements found in the related  biometric  standard. Manual software development  was then required to code each of the assertions listed  in the CTM documentation. This process required  a large amount of development time after the  publication of the standard and related CTM, and often  resulted in long delays in the release of conformance  tools. This approach also defned conformance tests  statically, meaning that:  • End users with domain-specifc requirements  or user-defned felds were not able to modify  the conformance tests or parsing rules.  • Any modifcation to the base standard  requirements or subsequent revision of the  standard required a new release of BioCTS  applications.  To alleviate these issues, the new version of  BioCTS was designed to allow a modifcation of test  assertions and parsing rules. This approach required  a confguration fle to specify requirements and allow  the software to respond to the needs of the end user.  BioCTS AN MRT had two releases in FY 2017.  The frst release included a command line interface  (CLI) as well as a graphical user interface (GUI). It  supported Level-1 testing, fle format testing that  checks for the allowed content, length, and value for  fve diferent standards and profles specifed within  the AN MRTs. Since the MRT fles can be combined  to support multiple standards, updates and profles,  BioCTS AN MRT was designed to allow users to test  against multiple standards during a single test.  Figure 7 - BioCTS AN MRT Testing Multiple  Standards Within Single Test 29  ITL CYBERSECURITY PROGRAM AND PROJECTS  |  FY 2017  The second release included further refnements  of the existing tools, and expanded the testing  capabilities to include Level-2 testing, or the testing  of inter-feld as well as inter-record relationships,  checking data between two or more related data  felds. The current release of BioCTS AN MRT supports  all Level-1 and Level-2 tests defned by the MRTs.  Work on BioCTS AN MRT continued through FY  2017, and an additional release that supports expanded  character sets, as well as additional enhancements, is  expected to be released in FY 2018.

HAVA  established the Election Assistance Commission  (EAC) and the Technical Guidelines Development  Committee (TGDC), chaired by the Director of NIST.  HAVA directs NIST to provide technical support to the  EAC and TGDC in eforts related to human factors,  security, and laboratory accreditation.  NIST and the EAC established a set of public  working groups to inform the development of a new  version of the Volunary Voting Systems Guidelines  (VVSG). The NIST and EAC goals are to accelerate  the development and adoption of the VVSG by  leading these working groups in close consultation  with election ofcials, voting system manufacturers,  standards bodies, academic researchers, and other  members of the public. These working groups focus  on multiple voting system technology areas, including  accessibility, usability, interoperability, security, testing  and certifcation.  The cybersecurity public working group designed  principles and guidelines to form the basis for the  security requirements in the new version of the VVSG.  Although 15 principles exist, the security-related  principles include auditability, ballot secrecy, physical  security, access control, system integrity, detection  and monitoring, and data protection. Many of these  principles are already included in previous iterations  of the federal standards, whereas others are new  areas of focus (e.g., system integrity). These principles  and guidelines were presented to, and adopted by, the  Technical Guidelines and Development Committee  (TGDC).  In FY 2018, NIST will continue leading the public  working groups to inform the development of  voting system requirements based on the principles  and guidelines. Additionally, test assertions will be  developed to improve the quality and consistency  of testing activities by accredited voting system test  laboratories (VSTLs).

PSCR  t SECURITY  Nationwide Public Safety Broadband  Network (NPSBN) Cybersecurity  Source: https://www.pscr.gov/  In February 2012, Congress passed the Middle  Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act. One portion  of this legislation calls for the establishment of a  nationwide, interoperable public-safety broadband  network based on the 3rd Generation Partnership  Project’s (3GPP) Long Term Evolution (LTE)  technology. The network will be deployed and  operated by the First Responder Network Authority  (FirstNet). The planned Nationwide Public Safety  Broadband Network (NPSBN) will “create a much  needed nationwide interoperable broadband network  that will help police, frefghters, emergency medical  service professionals and other public safety ofcials  stay safe and do their jobs” (see https://www.ntia.  doc.gov/category/public-safety). NIST is directed to  conduct research and development that supports  the acceleration and advancement of the nationwide  network.  In FY 2017, CSD, ACD, and the NCCoE continued  to support the joint National Telecommunications  and Information Administration (NTIA) and NIST  Public Safety Communications Research (PSCR)  program (see  https://www.pscr.gov) with eforts in  public-safety mobile-application security, identity  management, data and application isolation  technologies, wearable devices, and broadband  standards. The PSCR’s Annual Public Safety Broadband  Stakeholder Conference, held in June 2017, continued  to be a valuable venue for ITL to provide updates on  each of our ongoing projects. The conference also  provided a venue to directly interface with the public  safety and frst responder communities.  The mobile devices that will operate on the NPSBN  will be utilized in unique ways when compared to their  public counterparts. The same device(s) will likely  be shared between public safety ofcials as each  individual goes on and of duty. Furthermore, there will  be a need for fexible distribution and credentialing of  devices and users in situations where multiple public  safety organizations are called into action. To facilitate  these needs NIST, through the NCCoE, piloted a  proof-of-concept single sign on (SSO) for mobile  applications on iOS and Android.  Due to the vital nature of frst responder activities,  the mobile applications that will serve public safety  in their mission will require more scrutiny when  evaluated for software bugs and vulnerabilities  than applications targeted at the public. In FY 2017,  NIST continued to expand its expertise in mobile  application vetting tools and practices. In addition  to publishing NISTIR 8136, An Overview of Mobile  Application Vetting Services for Public Safety, ACD, in  conjunction with NIST Software and System’s Division  (SSD), expanded the Static Analysis Tool Exposition  (SATE) to include mobile application analysis for the  frst time. This exposition seeks to improve methods  for measuring the efectiveness of mobile application  vetting tools.  ITL continued to participate in the standards  development process for LTE technology within the  3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP), supporting  security requirements for public safety that are related  to Proximity Services (ProSe), Group Communication  System Enablers (GCSE), and Mission Critical Push-To- Talk (MCPTT). NIST also broadened its participation  in 3GPP’s 5th Generation Mobile Networks (5G). In  addition, researchers broadened their scope within  the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) to include  eforts related to public safety.  In FY 2018, CSD and ACD will continue to  strengthen NIST’s relationship with both public  safety and commercial telecom stakeholders. Work  concerning mobile application vetting and cyber  security will continue to evolve as NIST refnes both  its methods for tool evaluation as well as its corpus  of test cases used in those evaluations. PSCR is  working diligently to fund grants and prize challenges  to both solve current problems and fll future gaps  in public safety broadband technology. In FY 2018,  ITL will also take on a crucial role in this work by  providing cybersecurity expertise and guidance in the  administration of these awards. 31  https://www.pscr.gov/ https://www.ntia.doc.gov/category/public-safety https://www.ntia.doc.gov/category/public-safety https://www.pscr.gov  ITL CYBERSECURITY PROGRAM AND PROJECTS  |  FY 2017  CONTACTS:  Mr. Michael Ogata  Dr. Nelson Hastings  (301) 975-6993  (301) 975-5237  michael.ogata@nist.gov nelson.hastings@nist.gov  Cybersecurity for Industrial Control  Systems  NIST’s Industrial Control System (ICS)  cybersecurity efort is focused on providing guidance  and insights into the domain of securing connected  physical systems. ACD is supporting the NIST  Engineering Laboratory’s (EL) efort to develop and  implement guidance aimed at efectively securing  ICS, initially focusing on Smart Manufacturing  Environments. Using an ICS cybersecurity testbed,  a portion of which is shown in Figure 8, NIST will  measure the network and operational performance of  these systems when instrumented with cybersecurity  protections, in accordance with the best practices  and requirements prescribed by national and  international standards and guidelines. Examples of  such standards and guidelines include International  Society of Automation (ISA) standard ISA/IEC-62443  and SP 800-82 Revision 2, Guide to Industrial Control  Systems (ICS) Security (see https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/  nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-82r2.pdf).  Industrial Control Systems are an essential  component in manufacturing environments.  Increasing reliance on technology, communication,  and the interconnectivity of ICS and IT has expanded  the potential vulnerabilities and increased the  potential risk to manufacturing operations. While  these manufacturing systems become smarter and  increasingly connected, providing a tremendous  increase in value and efciency, they also present  a new challenge: “How is cybersecurity efectively  applied to this connected domain?”  Figure 8: Collaborative robotics portion of the ICS  cybersecurity testbed  The ICS cybersecurity team has used existing  standards, in conjunction with the NIST Framework  for Improving Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity, to  develop a target profle for applying cybersecurity  protections within manufacturing environments. The  development of this profle helps establish a roadmap  for reducing cybersecurity risk for manufacturers  that is aligned with manufacturing sector goals and  industry best practices. The profle tailors existing  cybersecurity control language to be more aligned  with operational technology environments, focusing  on desired cybersecurity outcomes to identify  opportunities for improving the current cybersecurity  posture of a manufacturing system. Through a session  during the 2016 Cybersecurity Framework Workshop  and two public comment periods, the team solicited  feedback from industry partners to help solidify the  content in the profle. The Cybersecurity Framework  Manufacturing Profle was published as NISTIR 8183  (see https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/ir/2017/NIST.  IR.8183.pdf).  In 2018, NIST will continue the process of applying  the guidance presented in the Manufacturing Profle  by implementing the recommended cybersecurity  controls within the ICS cybersecurity testbed.  This application of cybersecurity controls in an  ICS environment will enable the measuring and  understanding of the network and operational  performance impacts that cybersecurity protections  have on these systems. In addition to providing  performance data, this project will produce  documentation relating to the implementation  intricacies and special requirements presented by  these non-traditional environments.

The NIST Smart  Grid program is led by the Engineering Laboratory  (EL) with support from the Physical Measurement and  Information Technology Laboratories. The objective  of the program is to advance the measurement  science that will increase asset utilization and  efciency, improve grid reliability, and enable greater  use of renewable energy sources in the grid through  research, standardization, testing and implementation  of the NIST Smart Grid Interoperability Framework.  In the Spring of 2017, the Smart Grid Interoperability  Panel (SGIP) merged with the Smart Electric Power  Alliance (SEPA). SEPA’s Smart Grid Cybersecurity  Committee (SGCC) is led by an ITL representative.  The SGCC conducts regular outreach regarding  cybersecurity issues related to the smart grid,  including such topics as identity and key management.  Examples of this outreach include bi-weekly calls and  support to the SEPA Grid Evolution Summit held on  July 25-27, 2017 in Washington, D.C., where the SGCC  held its annual face-to-face meeting and included a  presentation on the public key infrastructure by ACD’s  Tim Polk. In addition to participating in SEPA’s SGCC,  CSD and ACD personnel are participating in SEPA’s  OpenFMB working groups to support cybersecurity  capabilities.  In FY 2017, researchers from ITL worked on  defning a grid edge experiment to understand the  performance impact of cybersecurity capabilities  on resource-constrained components of the grid. In  addition, researchers explored how to leverage and  incorporate cybersecurity risk management into  the next version of the Smart Grid Interoperability  Framework. ITL experts supported the Department  of Energy (DoE) Cyber Resilient Energy Delivery  Consortium (CREDC) program by participating in their  Annual Industry Workshop in Tempe, AZ and program  peer review held in Washington, D.C. Through a grant  to the University of New Hampshire, NIST supported  research into adding security mechanisms to the IEEE  1588 Precision Time Protocol (PTP).  In FY 2018, ITL will continue to coordinate with EL  and the Smart Grid Program in the development of the  next version of the NIST Smart Grid Interoperability  Framework 2.0 and in an execution of the grid edge  experiment on the NIST Smart Grid Testbed. ITL  will continue to chair SEPA’s SGCC and support the  DoE CREDC program, and will look for and explore  opportunities to collaborate with the National  Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) about smart  grid cybersecurity.

To develop processes  that deliver high-quality software, it is vital to be able  to fnd, characterize, and categorize vulnerabilities,  weaknesses, and faults that appear in code. Processes  can then be improved to preclude these faults, detect  them earlier, or build in mitigations for them. The  NIST Software Assurance Metrics And Tool Evaluation  (SAMATE) program promotes efective software  assurance processes and also evaluates methods for  automated tools to provide confdence that software  is free from vulnerabilities. The SAMATE program has  three primary components: the Software Assurance  Reference Dataset (SARD), the Static Analysis Tool  Exposition (SATE), and the Bugs Framework (BF).  SARD is a public repository of hundreds of  thousands of computer programs with known security  faws (see https://samate.nist.gov/SARD). The  programs are primarily in fve computer languages,  C, C++, Java, PHP, and C#, and include synthetic test  cases (small programs written as tests), open-source  production programs, and production programs with  vulnerabilities injected. See Figure 9 for a graph of the  size, type, and languages of the test cases. This rich  collection allows software developers to assess tools 33  https://www.nist.gov/engineering-laboratory/smart-grid https://www.nist.gov/engineering-laboratory/smart-grid https://www.nist.gov/programs-projects/cybersecurity-smart-grid-systems https://www.nist.gov/programs-projects/cybersecurity-smart-grid-systems https://sepapower.org mailto:nelson.hastings@nist.gov https://samate.nist.gov/SARD/ https://samate.nist.gov/SARD/  ITL CYBERSECURITY PROGRAM AND PROJECTS  |  FY 2017  0)  m  :::l  0)  C#  Java  C PHP m  _J  C++  C  Bar height is log number of test cases '? ~ ~ c::=::=ii (not to scale) ,oo~  � D ~  D nr:==7  •  5 10 100 1000 10000  Number of lines of code  D SYN  D PRO  D INJ  • • •  100000  and helps tool developers to refne their techniques.

NIST  remained committed to the value of communicating  its R&D eforts to other federal colleagues and  identifying the opportunities to support R&D eforts  throughout the Federal Government.  NIST is a consistent presence at the monthly  cybersecurity meetings with Bill Newhouse, National  Cybersecurity Center of Excellence (NCCoE) Security  Engineer and the National Initiative for Cybersecurity  Education (NICE) Deputy Director, as the co-chair  of the Cyber Security and Information Assurance  Interagency Working Group (CSIA IWG). During  FY 2017, NIST provided updates to the CSIA IWG  describing the updates to the NIST Cybersecurity  Framework, SP 800-53, Security and Privacy Controls  for Information Systems and Organizations, and the  NICE program.  Naomi Lefkowitz, Senior Privacy Policy Advisor  at NIST, co-chairs the Privacy R&D IWG, which  coordinates the multidisciplinary research and  development conducted by NITRD agencies that seek  to produce knowledge and technologies that identify  and mitigate emerging risks to our privacy, and that  enables individuals, companies, and the government  to beneft from technological advancements while  being able to efectively balance the resulting benefts  with resulting risks to privacy. The activity involves  research into and development of methods for  characterizing privacy expectations, understanding  privacy violations, engineering privacy-protecting  systems, recovering from privacy violations, and the  impact of privacy on public policy and of public policy  on privacy.  Ram Sriram is the co-chair of NITRD’s Software  Productivity, Sustainability, and Quality (SPSQ)  Interagency Working Group (IWG). Robert B. Bohn  is the co-chair of NITRD’s Faster Administration of  S&T Education and Research (FASTER) Community  of Practice (CoP). Barry I. Schneider is co-chair of  High End Computing (HEC) IWG. Chris Greer and Al  Wavering from NIST’s Engineering Laboratory co- chair NITRD’s Cyber Physical Systems (CPS) IWG and  the High Confdence Software and Systems (HCSS)  IWG, respectively.  Tim Polk is the principal NIST participant in the bi- weekly coordination activities of the federal Special  Cyber Operations Research and Engineering (SCORE)  Committee. SCORE enables technology transfer  through the sharing of NIST cybersecurity expertise  and publications with researchers throughout the  Federal Government. The SCORE committee interacts  with federal leaders and reports to the National  Science and Technology Council’s Committee on  Homeland and National Security.  All the NIST leaders for interagency coordination  leverage these working groups and committees to  communicate powerfully about NIST’s research,  frameworks, and publications and bring back insights  and activities relevant to NIST’s work.

Digital evidence can  be a part of investigating most crimes, since material  relevant to the crime may be recorded in digital form.  Methods for securely acquiring, storing and analyzing  digital evidence quickly and efciently are critical. ITL  promotes the efcient and efective use of computer  technology to investigate crimes. The project team  develops tools for testing computer forensic software,  including test criteria and test sets. ITL also maintains  the National Software Reference Library (NSRL) – a  36  https://www.nitrd.gov mailto:william.newhouse@nist.gov  NIST/ITL CYBERSECURITY PROGRAM ANNUAL REPORT 2017  vast archive of published software applications that is  an important resource for both criminal investigators  and historians.  National Software Reference Library  The NSRL is designed to collect software  from various sources and incorporate fle profles  computed from this software into a Reference Data  Set (RDS) of information. The RDS can be used by law  enforcement, government, and industry organizations  to review fles on a computer by matching fle profles  in the RDS. This will help alleviate much of the efort  involved in determining which fles are important as  evidence on computers or fle systems that have been  seized as part of criminal investigations. The NSRL  also provides a research environment to promote the  development of new forensics techniques and other  applications in computer science.  The RDS continues to be the premier software  resource and, in FY 2017, the NSRL published four  releases. There are currently 23,000 microcomputer  applications and 160,000 mobile device applications  yielding a combined total of 326 million fles. In FY  2017, the NSRL was expanded to include mobile  applications and to include the profles obtained from  installing and exercising applications.  Computer Forensics Tool Testing Project  There is a critical need in the law enforcement  community to ensure the reliability of computer  forensic tools. The goal of the Computer Forensic  Tool Testing (CFTT) project at NIST is to establish  a methodology for testing computer forensic  software tools by the development of general tool  specifcations, test procedures, test criteria, test sets,  and test hardware. The project is intended to provide  the information necessary for toolmakers to improve  tools, for users to make informed choices about  acquiring and using computer forensics tools, and  for interested parties to understand the capabilities  of the tools. The project team’s approach for testing  computer forensic tools is based on well-recognized  international methodologies for conformance testing  and quality testing that ensures that forensic software  tools consistently produce accurate and objective test  results.  In FY 2016, the CFTT project expanded to allow  forensics testers to use the NIST testing methodology  in their own labs and to produce standardized test  reports for disk imaging forensic tools. In FY 2017,  federated testing was further expanded with three  major updates: a revision to disk-imaging testing, the  addition of mobile device tool testing and hardware  write-blocker testing. In FY 2018, the project will be  expanded to support string searching and forensic  media preparation. The forensic community is  beginning to use federated testing to test tools and  share test reports. The CFTT project also maintains the  Forensics Tool Catalog and the Computer Forensics  Reference Data Sets (CFReDS). The Tool Catalog  website is a community-sourced catalog of forensic  tools aided by a taxonomy of forensic tools. The Tool  Catalog grew by 17 tools in FY 2017. The CFReDS data  sets are used in a variety of settings, such as university  classes, to try out forensics tools on known data.

NICE has been  focusing on eforts to achieve this by aligning to three  goals: 1) accelerate learning and skills development, 2)  nurture a diverse learning community, and 3) guide  career development and workforce planning.  In support of goal 1, in November 2016, CyberSeek  was launched to provide a visualization of the  demand for and supply of cybersecurity workers  across the nation (see http://cyberseek.org). At its  launch, the tool also provided a visualization of career  pathways in cybersecurity. The data from this tool, in  part, has helped NICE develop an executive overview  white paper on Cybersecurity Workforce Demand. In  FY 2017, NICE also supported goal one through the  development of a paper regarding Cybersecurity  Apprenticeships. This report and other white papers  developed by NICE authors are available at https://  www.nist.gov/itl/applied-cybersecurity/nice/  resources/one-pagers.  In support of goal 2, NICE hosted a Veterans in  Cybersecurity Workshop in March 2017. This workshop  convened approximately 40 representatives of federal  and state government, branches of the military,  industry, and workforce development organizations  to explore issues, discuss initiatives and better  understand the gaps that exist in helping our veterans  In support of goal 3, NICE published SP 800-181,  The NICE Framework, in August 2017 (see https://  nist.gov/nice/framework). The NICE Framework  establishes a taxonomy and common lexicon that  is to be used to describe all cybersecurity work and  workers, irrespective of where or for whom the work  is performed. Figure 11 shows the seven categories of  the NICE Framework. These categories further break  down into Specialty Areas, Work Roles, Tasks, and  Knowledge, Skills, and Abilities (KSAs).  Figure 12: Clarence Williams, Lead for Government  Engagement at NICE, and Rodney Petersen,  Director of NICE, speak with an attendee at the  CyberSecureGov Conference in Washington, D.C.  NICE continued its coordination with academic,  industry and government partners throughout the  year at various meetings, workshops and events. In  August 2017, NICE held a workshop in Chicago, Illinois.

Consistently one of the most-visited  websites at NIST, CSRC is used by several ITL  divisions to communicate information about NIST’s  cybersecurity and privacy programs and projects,  research, validation testing, software tools, and other  areas of interest to NIST’s customers in government,  industry, academia and elsewhere, both within the  U.S. and globally.  The CSRC website serves as a primary NIST  repository of cybersecurity and privacy standards,  guidelines, and technical documents. Refer to the  Publications Released in FY 2017 section of this  annual report for details about the ITL Cybersecurity  Program’s publications released in FY 2017.  CSRC’s most signifcant event occurred in  September 2017, with the launch of a completely  redesigned, content management system-based  website. In addition to aligning with the main NIST  website’s look and feel, the new CSRC website is  organized around several primary content types to  make information easier to fnd and maintain: projects,  publications, news, events and presentations. A new  taxonomy of topics is used to tag content site-wide,  and an online, searchable glossary of information  security terminology expands on the terms identifed  in NISTIR 7298 Revision 2. One of the most noticeable  changes is a vastly improved publications section, in  terms of content, searchability, and browsing. At the  end of FY 2017, the site provided detailed information  about more than 1,200 of NIST’s current and historical  information security publications.  The CSRC Redesign Team designed the site’s  architecture and interface to signifcantly improve  site navigation, search, and the ability of ITL staf to  maintain and contribute content. The site also uses  responsive design to greatly improve CSRC’s usability  on mobile devices. More than 21,000 individual  content items were transferred from the legacy site,  and in February 2017, ITL successfully launched a  beta version of the new site. Feedback from beta- site users over seven months was incorporated by  the CSRC Redesign Team to fx bugs, implement  enhancements, and refne the site’s look and feel. The  team considered all comments it received, and made  every efort to implement those suggestions. After  making signifcant, gradual improvements to the beta  site, NIST launched the new CSRC on September 18,  2017, while simultaneously retiring the legacy site.  In FY 2018, the CSRC Redesign Team will continue  to enhance the content, functionality and usability of  the new site, striving to provide a better and more  useful experience to site users.  The CSRC team maintains an email subscription  list with more than 78,000 subscribers worldwide.  Subscribers receive notifcations when news updates,  event details, and publication information—including  the release of draft publications for public comment—  are posted to CSRC.

The Forum, which serves more than 1,000  members, strives to provide an ongoing opportunity  for managers of federal information security  programs to exchange information security materials  in a timely manner, build upon the experiences of  other programs, and to reduce possible duplication  of eforts. It provides a mechanism for NIST to share  information directly with federal agency information  security managers in fulfllment of NIST’s leadership  mandate under FISMA. The Forum also assists NIST  in establishing and maintaining relationships with  other individuals and organizations that are actively  addressing information security issues within the  Federal Government. During FY 2017, CSD’s Victoria  Pillitteri and Jody Jacobs served as Co-Chairs, and  Peggy Himes from ACD served as the Secretariat of  the Forum, providing administrative and logistical  support. Additionally, during FY 2017, the FCSM  webpage was signifcantly restructured and updated  to ensure that presentation information, both current  and archived, is delivered as efciently and efectively  as possible.  The Forum maintains an extensive email  subscription service/listserv. Participation in the  service is restricted to those Federal and State  Government employees and their designated support  contractors with a role in the management of their  organization’s information system security program.  The email listserv ofers an open forum for information  sharing of best practices and recommendations, and  serves as a resource for this community of interest.  The Forum conducts quarterly meetings and an  annual two-day conference for a discussion of current  issues and topics of interest to those responsible for  supporting the information security programs of  federal agencies.  Discussion topics at the quarterly FCSM meetings  in FY 2017 included briefngs on:  • The National Cybersecurity Center of  Excellence (NCCoE) - Federally Funded  Research and Development Center (FFRDC),  • Developing an information security continuous  monitoring (ISCM) Assessment Methodology,  • Security Automation and Continuous  Monitoring,  • Demonstration of a Continuous Diagnostic  Monitoring Instance,  • Guidance for Assigning New Cybersecurity  Codes to Positions with IT/Cybersecurity/  Cyber-related Functions and the New  Cybercareers.gov Site,  • Using Risk Management to Improve Privacy in  Federal Systems,  • National Cybersecurity and Communications  Integration Center (NCCIC) 101, and  • Creating a Cybersecurity Scorecard for a  Federal Agency.  FY 2017’s annual two-day meeting was held at  NIST on June 20-21, 2017 with over 220 attendees.  Presentations included the current technical,  operational and management information systems  security topics and updates on the information  system security activities of OMB, General Services  Administration (GSA), Department of Homeland  Security (DHS), Department of Health and Human  Services (HHS), NARA, Internal Revenue Service (IRS),  National Weather Service (NOAA), Ofce of Personnel  Management (OPM), and NIST. A frst ever “ask the  experts” panel was held where attendees could ask  subject matter experts on security, privacy, and  procurement-related questions.

FISSEA strives  to elevate the general level of information system  security knowledge for the Federal Government  and the federal workforce. It also seeks to assist the  professional development of its members.  FISSEA membership is open to information system  security professionals, professional trainers and  educators, and managers responsible for information  system security training programs in federal agencies,  as well as contractors of these agencies and faculty  members of accredited educational institutions who  are involved in information security training and  education. Willingness to share products, information,  and experiences is all that is required to become a  FISSEA member. A working group meets monthly to  administer business activities.  FISSEA maintains a website and a mailing list, and  participates in a social networking site as a means of  communication for its members. CSD assists FISSEA  with its operations by providing staf support for  several of its activities and by being FISSEA’s host  agency.  The 30th Annual FISSEA Conference occurred on  June 19, 2017 at NIST. The FISSEA audience included  managers responsible for information systems  security awareness, training, certifcations, workforce  identifcation, compliance, etc. in federal agencies;  contractors providing awareness and training support;  and faculty members of accredited educational  institutions who are involved in information security  training and education. Clarence Williams, Peggy  Himes, Gretchen Morris (DB Consulting Group/NASA),  and other members of the FISSEA Working Group,  were integral to the efort to support the conference.  This year’s theme was “Securing the Future to  Infnity and Beyond: Improving Cybersecurity through  Awareness, Training, and Education”.

The Board plays a  central and unique role in providing the government  with expert advice concerning information security  and privacy issues that may afect federal information  systems. Title III of the E-Government Act of 2002  reafrmed the need for this Board by giving it an  additional responsibility: to thoroughly review all  of the proposed information technology standards  and guidelines developed under Section 20 of the  National Institute of Standards and Technology Act  (15 U.S. Code (U.S.C.) 278g-3), as amended.  The ISPAB is a federal advisory committee with  specifc statutory objectives to identify emerging  managerial, technical, administrative, and physical  safeguard issues related to information security  and privacy. The Board was originally created by  the Computer Security Act of 1987 (P.L. 100-235)  as the Computer System Security and Privacy  Advisory Board (CSSPAB) within the Department of  Commerce. The CSSPAB was chartered in May 1988 in  accordance with the Federal Advisory Committee Act,  as amended. The 2002 FISMA legislation amended  the statutory authority of the Board and provided its  current name.  The duties of the Board, as stipulated in FISMA,  include:  • Identifcation of emerging managerial,  technical, administrative, and physical  safeguard issues relative to information  security and privacy;  • Advising NIST, DHS and the Director of the  OMB on information security and privacy  issues pertaining to Federal Government  information systems (including the thorough  review of proposed standards and guidelines  developed under 15 U.S.C. 278g-3 - Computer  Standards Program); and  • Annually reporting its fndings to the  Secretary of Commerce, the Director of the  OMB, the Director of NSA, and the appropriate  committees of Congress.  Congress indicated the long-term need for the  Board by setting the term of Board members to four  years. The charter requires that the NIST Director  appoint the Chairperson and all 12 members of the  Board.

The diversity of these categories  helps the Board to meet its statutory objectives.  Federal members bring a detailed understanding  of the federal processing environment; industry  brings concerns and experiences regarding product  development and market formation, while private  computer security experts are able to bring their  experiences of commercial cost-efective security  measures into Board discussions.  Chris Boyer is currently the Chair of ISPAB. Mr.  Boyer, the Assistant Vice President for Global Public  Policy at AT&T, joined the Board in 2012 and assumed  the responsibilities of the Chair in January 2016 (see  list of Board members https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/  ISPAB/Members).  During FY 2017, ISPAB held three meetings, all in  Washington, D.C.:  • June 28-30, 2017;  • March 29-31, 2017; and  • October 26-28, 2016.  In keeping with previous practices at the frst  meeting of each fscal year, the Board established a  work plan for FY 2017. The resulting plan included the  following areas of focus:  • Cryptography, and specifcally NIST R&D;  • Metrics – success measures for security and  privacy;  • Trust in NIST (accountability and success);  • Quantum-resistant encryption;  • Identity management;  • Privacy engineering;  • FISMA – Continuous Diagnostics and  Mitigation (CDM) and Federal Risk and  Authorization Management Program  (FedRAMP);  • High-Value Asset cybersecurity;  • Cybersecurity; and  • Updates of other critical NIST publications.  In aligning with the work-plan focus areas, the  Board expanded its work to include the following:  • Acquisition, Supply Chain Security, and Open  Source trustworthy software;  • Mobile Devices and the Protection of Sensitive  Information;  • Machine Learning and Artifcial Intelligence;  • The NIST Cybersecurity Framework;  • The Federal Information Security Management  Act (FISMA);  • Emerging Technologies; and  • The National Cybersecurity Center of  Excellence (NCCoE).  The presenters at each Board meeting were  leaders and experts representing private industry,  academia, federal agency Chief Information Ofcers  (CIOs), Inspector Generals (IGs) and Chief Information  Security Ofcers (CISOs).  Copies of the current list of members and their  biographies, the Board’s charter and past Board  activities are located at https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/  ISPAB.

SMBs cannot  always justify an extensive security program or even  full-time staf devoted to information security. Faced  with limited resources and budgets, SMBs need  practical solutions and training that enable them to  cost-efectively address their cybersecurity risks. NIST  has partnered with other federal agencies and public- private organizations to help address these needs.  During FY 2017, the Small Business Outreach  Program accomplished the following:  • Partnered with other federal agencies to  catalog and evaluate existing cybersecurity  educational materials designed for SMB use;  • Collaborated with federal partners, led by the  Small Business Administration (SBA) and the  Department of Homeland Security (DHS),  on the development of the Small Business  Development Center Cyber Strategy;  • Reviewed available SMB training programs  from federal partners and the National Cyber  Security Alliance (NCSA);  • Evaluated existing NIST SMB-focused  educational materials such as reports,  presentations, and online content;  • Updated the Small Business Corner website  to refect program updates and simplify SMB  contact with NIST;  • Initiated the development of the NIST  strategic plan for small business outreach,  refecting requirements in new Congressional  legislation; and  • Published Revision 1 of NISTIR 7621,  Small Business Information Security: The  Fundamentals.

NIST has standardized two families of Secure  Hash Algorithms (SHA): SHA-1 and SHA-2 in Federal  Information Processing Standard (FIPS) 180, and  SHA-3 in FIPS 202.  The SHA-1 function—which was published in the  original version of FIPS 180 in 1995, and which is still  specifed along with the SHA-2 family in FIPS 180-4—  has been deprecated for many years, because it could  no longer be relied upon to provide the important  property of “collision resistance.” In fact, in 2017 a  SHA-1 collision (diferent inputs with the same output)  was published by researchers at Centrum Wiskunde  & Informatica (CWI) Institute of Amsterdam and  Google, based on the seminal cryptanalysis in 2005  In FY 2018, the Small Business Outreach Program  will continue to collaborate with federal and other  partners to understand the cybersecurity needs of  SMBs and identify and/or develop materials and  training to meet those needs.  by Xiaoyun Wang of Shandong University.  Wang’s research was the main impetus to the  development of SHA-3 through a public competition,  which NIST initiated in 2007. The winning algorithm,  KECCAK, was chosen in part because its components  45  https://www.nist.gov/programs-projects/small-business-corner-sbc https://www.nist.gov/programs-projects/small-business-corner-sbc mailto:smallbizsecurity@nist.gov mailto:nelson.hastings@nist.gov mailto:marian.merritt@nist.gov mailto:jeffrey.marron@nist.gov mailto:matthew.barrett@nist.gov https://www.nist.gov/publications/small  ITL CYBERSECURITY PROGRAM AND PROJECTS  |  FY 2017  could easily be adapted to provide a variety of  functionalities.  FIPS 202 realized some of this potential by  including two eXtendable Output Functions (XOFs),  which allow variable-length outputs, in addition to its  four hash functions. The two XOFs are called SHAKE128  and SHAKE256; the numerical sufx indicates the  supported security strength. FIPS 202 also supports  a fexible scheme for “domain separation” between  diferent functions, which ensures that diferent  named functions will produce unrelated outputs.  In December 2016, NIST further expanded the  uses of KECCAK with the publication SP 800-185, SHA- 3 Derived Functions: cSHAKE, KMAC, TupleHash and  ParallelHash. It provides four new types of functions,  as indicated in the title, each with the same two  supported security strengths:  • cSHAKE128 and cSHAKE256 are XOFs that  can be “customized” for individual users or  applications, so that their outputs would be  unrelated to any other SHAKE variants;  • KMAC128 and KMAC256 are keyed-hash  functions with variable-length outputs, i.e.,  pseudorandom functions (PRFs);  • TupleHash128 and TupleHash256 are hash  functions on tuples of input strings; and  • ParallelHash128 and ParallelHash256 are hash  functions that can exploit parallel processing  to efciently hash long messages.  NIST is currently considering the development  of a parallelizable hashing mode and XOF mode for  generic hash functions (e.g., SHA-2). These modes  would allow the SHA-2 family to achieve some of the  functionality of the SHA-3 family.

This publication includes a specifcation of  the Data Encryption Algorithm (DEA) engine that was  originally specifed in FIPS 46, The Data Encryption  Standard, in 1977 and was withdrawn as an approved  algorithm in 2005.  A security analysis and practical demonstration  of attacks on TDEA in several real-world protocols  was posted in FY 2017 by Karthikeyan Bhargavan  and Gaëtan Leurent of Inria (Paris) and is available at  https://sweet32.info/. This article provides evidence  that the collision attack on TDEA represents a serious  security vulnerability for many common uses of  these protocols — including the Hyper Text Transfer  Protocol Secure (HTTPS) protocol for secure Internet  connections. Moreover, the analysis shows that the  security vulnerability remains serious unless more  stringent limits are imposed on the amount of data  that can be encrypted under a single three-key bundle  than the current data limit recommended by NIST in  SP 800-67, Revision 1.  In response to this article, NIST posted a notice  announcing plans to reduce the maximum amount  of plaintext allowed to be encrypted under a single  TDEA three-key bundle from 232 to 220 (64-bit) blocks,  and to revise SP 800-67 accordingly. In addition, NIST  plans to disallow TDEA for TLS, IPsec and possibly  other protocols (see https://csrc.nist.gov/News/2017/  Update-to-Current-Use-and-Deprecation-of-TDEA  for the announcement).  In late FY 2017, a revision of SP 800-67 was  provided for public comment that included the above  restriction on the usage of TDEA for each three-key  TDEA key bundle. SP 800-67 Rev 2 will be published  in early FY 2018.

For example,  random bits are used to generate the keys needed  for encryption and digital signature applications.  CSD began work on the specifcation of random  bit generators in the late 1990s. Information on the  Random Bit Generation project is available at https://  csrc.nist.gov/projects/random-bit-generation.  This project consists of the development of  three NIST Special Publications (SPs). SP 800-90A,  Recommendation for Random Number Generation  Using Deterministic Random Bit Generators, was  initially published in 2007 and last revised in 2015. It  specifes several deterministic algorithms that can  be used for the generation of pseudorandom bits –  a sequence of bits produced by an algorithm, rather  than a random physical phenomenon that produces a  truly random sequence. Two additional documents (SP  800-90B and SP 800-90C) are under development,  and the latest drafts were made available for public  comment in 2016 via the Special Publications page:  https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/PubsSPs.html.  SP 800-90B, Recommendation for the  Entropy Sources Used for Random Bit Generation,  addresses the development and testing of entropy  sources. Figure 13 illustrates the model that the  Recommendation uses to describe an entropy source  and its components: a noise source, health tests, and  an optional conditioning component.  In Figure 13, the noise source contains the entropy- providing activity (e.g., the output of ring oscillators);  if the activity being sampled does not produce binary  data, then the noise source includes a digitization  process. Health tests are intended to detect whether  the noise source and the entropy source (as a whole)  continues to operate as expected. The optional  conditioning component is responsible for reducing  bias and/or increasing the entropy rate of the bits to  eventually be output by the entropy source.  SP 800-90B includes descriptions of the tests for  NIST’s Cryptographic Algorithm Validation Program  (CAVP) and Cryptographic Module Validation Program  (CMVP) to validate candidate entropy sources. During  FY 2017, CSD fnalized the test descriptions for the  initial publication of SP 800-90B, which is expected  to be published in early FY 2018. CSD will begin a  revision of the document in FY 2018 to address issues  that were not included in the initial version of the  document and any lessons learned during validation  testing by the CAVP and CMVP labs.  The initial version of SP 800-90B will be available  via the Special Publications page: https://csrc.nist.  gov/publications/PubsSPs.html.  In May 2017, a presentation “A Tale of Two Entropy  Source Validation Approaches: NIST 800 90B vs.  BSI AIS 31” was provided by Meltem Sönmez Turan  at the ICMC17 International Cryptographic Module  Conference held in Washington D.C.  SP 800-90C, Recommendation for Random  Bit Generator (RBG) Constructions, provides  basic guidance on the construction of Random  Bit Generators (RBGs) from the entropy sources  validated against the requirements of SP 800-90B  and the Deterministic Random Bit Generators (DRBG)  algorithms of SP 800-90A. SP 800-90C includes  constructions for both non-deterministic random  bit generators (NRBGs; also known as true random  number generators) and deterministic random bit  generators (DRBGs; also known as pseudorandom  number generators). Two general models are provided  in SP 800-90C, as shown in Figure 14 and Figure 15.

In this construction, each  bit output by the entropy source (as discussed in SP  800-90B) is exclusive-ORed with a bit of output from  a DRBG algorithm specifed in SP 800-90A.  Figure 15: DRBG and Oversampling NRBG  Figure 15 depicts the construction used for  the DRBGs and the second NRBG design – the  Oversampling NRBG. In this construction. the entropy  source repeatedly provides input to the DRBG  algorithm to produce the requested output.  The diference between DRBGs and NRBGs is the  availability of the entropy source and the frequency  of requesting output from the entropy source. For a  DRBG, an entropy source is only required for seeding  the DRBG; after the initial seeding process, further  requests for entropy-source output depend on the  implementation and application. For the Oversampling  NRBG, the entropy source must always be available  and is accessed whenever bits are requested from the  NRBG by a consuming application.  The latest draft of SP 800-90C is available via  the Special Publications page: https://csrc.nist.gov/  publications/PubsSPs.html.  Plans for FY 2018:  The RBG development team has the following  goals for FY 2018:  • Publish the initial version of SP 800-90B  and post the comments received during the  last public comment period, along with their  resolutions. The testing of entropy sources  by the CAVP and CMVP will begin as soon as  possible after publication.  • Monitor the testing of SP 800-90B in the  CAVP and CMVP labs to determine problems  that need to be addressed in the next  version of SP 800-90B. In some cases, the  problems may be addressed by additions  to the FIPS 140-2 Implementation Guidance  document until SP 800-90B is revised. The  Implementation Guidance document is  available at https://csrc.nist.gov/groups/STM/  cmvp/documents/fps140-2/FIPS1402IG.pdf.  • Begin a revision of SP 800-90B to address  issues not included in the initial version of SP  800-90B, as well as any issues that surface  during CAVP and CMVP entropy source  validation.  • Finalize and publish 800-90C, posting the  comments received and their resolution, along  with the document.  • Complete plans for testing SP 800-90C.

It uses two independent, commercially  available sources of randomness, each with an  independent hardware entropy source and SP  800-90A-approved components.  The NIST Beacon is designed to provide  unpredictability, autonomy, and consistency.  48  https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/PubsSPs.html https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/PubsSPs.html https://csrc.nist.gov/groups/STM/cmvp/documents/fips140-2/FIPS1402IG.pdf https://csrc.nist.gov/groups/STM/cmvp/documents/fips140-2/FIPS1402IG.pdf https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/random-bit-generation mailto:elaine.barker@nist.gov mailto:john.kelsey@nist.gov mailto:meltem.turan@nist.gov https://beacon.nist.gov/home https://beacon.nist.gov/home mailto:kerry.mckay@nist.gov  NIST/ITL CYBERSECURITY PROGRAM ANNUAL REPORT 2017  Unpredictability means that users cannot  algorithmically predict bits before they are made  available by the source. Autonomy means that the  source is resistant to attempts by outside parties to  alter the distribution of the random bits. Consistency  means that a set of users can access the source in  such a way that they are confdent of receiving the  same random string.  The NIST Beacon posts bit-strings in blocks of  512 bits every 60 seconds. Each such value is time- stamped and signed to form a packet that also includes  the hash of the previous value to chain the sequence  of values together. This prevents all parties, even the  source, from retroactively changing an output packet  without being detected. The NIST Beacon keeps all  output packets. At any point in time, the full history of  outputs is available to users.  Tables of random numbers have probably  been used for multiple purposes at least since the  Industrial Revolution. In the digital age, algorithmic  pseudorandom number generators (PRNGs) have  largely replaced these tables. The NIST Beacon  expands the use of randomness to multiple scenarios  in which neither tables nor PRNGs can be used. The  extra functionalities stem mainly from three features.  First, the Beacon-generated numbers cannot be  predicted before they are published. Second, the  public, time-bound, and authenticated nature of the  Beacon allows a user application to prove to anybody  that it used truly random numbers not known before a  certain point in time. Third, this proof can be presented  ofine and at any point in the future.  Although commercially available physical sources  of randomness are adequate as entropy sources for  currently envisioned implementations of the NIST  Beacon, the NIST Randomness Beacon project team is  working on developing a source of verifably random  sequences. In collaboration with NIST physicists  from the Physical Measurement Laboratory (PML),  the project team aims to use quantum non-locality  to build an entropy source whose unpredictability  is guaranteed by the laws of physics. In FY 2016,  a major milestone was achieved, namely, a strong  loophole-free test of local realism (where individual  particles are governed by elements of reality, even  if these elements are hidden) (see https://www.nist.  gov/news-events/news/2015/11/nist-team-proves- spooky-action-distance-really-real).  The project team has also made progress in  helping other institutions set up interoperable sources.  This is important because multiple sources can be  combined in such a way that all sources would have  to be compromised in order to degrade the common  random strings. It is expected that the University  of Chile will start operating their own randomness  beacon during FY 2018.  As of the end of FY 2017, the NIST Beacon has  been functioning without major interruptions for more  than four years. During this time, the project team has  received valuable input from a growing community  of users. As a result, the project team has redesigned  the Application Programming Interface (API) and the  architecture. The changes provide higher security and  availability, as well as better interoperability. Version  2.0 of the NIST Beacon is scheduled to be deployed  during November 2017.  NIST encourages the community of users to  research and publish novel ways in which this tool can  be used.

The ability to generate strong cryptographic keys  is directly related to having access to unpredictable  random data, but generating truly unpredictable  random data on common computing devices is hard  and unreliable. As a result, weak keys are widely used  in cryptographic applications, thus compromising the  security of the sensitive data protected by them - potentially with disastrous consequences.  A primary goal of this project is to provide  high quality, truly unpredictable random data to  devices on the Internet to enable them to generate  strong cryptographic keys and attest the strength  of the keys used to protect data in transit or at rest,  49  https://www.nist.gov/news-events/news/2015/11/nist-team-proves-spooky-action-distance-really-real https://www.nist.gov/news-events/news/2015/11/nist-team-proves-spooky-action-distance-really-real https://www.nist.gov/news-events/news/2015/11/nist-team-proves-spooky-action-distance-really-real https://www.nist.gov/programs-projects/nist-randomness-beacon https://www.nist.gov/programs-projects/nist-randomness-beacon mailto:rene.peralta@nist.gov  ITL CYBERSECURITY PROGRAM AND PROJECTS  |  FY 2017  thereby enabling cryptographic system strength  attestation. Achieving this goal would provide a  solid basis for achieving the goals of the Automated  Cryptographic Validation Testing project (see https://  csrc.nist.gov/projects/acvt) as well as addressing the  problems targeted by the Cryptographic Programs  and Laboratory Accreditation (see the next section:  Validated Programs), where entropy estimation  has persisted as one of the most difcult and labor- consuming activities, causing problems for all parties  involved: the industry, the testing laboratories and the  government validators.  Random data obtained from sources of true  randomness that are based on unpredictable physical  phenomena, such as quantum efects, is much  better suited for cryptographic applications. CSD is  collaborating with the NIST Physical Measurement  Laboratory (PML) to build a quantum source. The  aim is to use quantum efects to generate sequences  that are guaranteed to be unpredictable, even  if an attacker has access to the random source.  (For more information on this collaboration, see  https://www.nist.gov/pml/div684/random_  numbers_bell_test.cfm).  This EaaS project aims to develop a system and  protocols for obtaining random data with high entropy  from one or more remote sources. The high-level  architecture is shown in Figure 16. The architecture  of the Entropy-as-a-Service system consists of two  main parts: the client-side and the server-side. The  critical components of the system are the quantum  device, the EaaS server and a secure device in the  client systems that is capable of providing strong  isolation and protection for the cryptographic keys  stored inside the device and ofering a set of basic  cryptographic services.  The EaaS server is continuously fed random data  from the attached quantum source. The data enters  a frst in, frst out (FIFO)-like bufer in the server’s  Random Access Memory (RAM), and, when a client  request arrives, the server reads the top value from  the bufer, signs and encrypts it, and then sends it  to the requester. The FIFO bufer shifts after every  request and when new data comes from the random  source. The EaaS server ensures that the FIFO bufer  is erased prior to server shutdown and never copied  to disk. Open implementations can help ensure that  this occurs.  The client system consists of a classic computing  device enabled with a dedicated hardware  component capable of storing secret cryptographic  keys and seeds. A dedicated software application  bridges the communication between EaaS and the  hardware component. Examples of secure hardware  components are the Trusted Platform Module  (TPM), TrustZone technology in Advanced Reduced  Instruction Set Computing (RISC) Machine (ARM)  processors, and Identity Protection Technology in  Intel processors. Recently, an alternative innovative  technology has emerged that allows extracting  unique cryptographic keys from the imperfections of  memory Static Random Access Memory (SRAM) cells  used in common computers. The idea behind this  technology is to extract PUF-like unique data from the  SRAM chip, which is then used to construct a unique  key. This technology is quite interesting for EaaS  applications on the client side because it eliminates  the need to provision an initial key for accessing  EaaS. If a client system or device does not have a  secure hardware component, it can still use EaaS. The  presence of a hardware component simply provides  further guarantees to the system or device user, when  present.  EaaS uses the Hyper Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP)  to transfer entropy payloads from the server to clients.  To secure this transmission, the server encrypts the  data using the client’s public key and digitally signs  the payload with the server’s own private key.  Client devices mix this data with locally available  random data to seed random number generators to  generate strong cryptographic keys and other random  values independently from the remote sources.  50  https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/acvt https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/acvt https://www.nist.gov/pml/div684/random_numbers_bell_test.cfm https://www.nist.gov/pml/div684/random_numbers_bell_test.cfm  NIST/ITL CYBERSECURITY PROGRAM ANNUAL REPORT 2017  network  capability,  i.e . device Q.!1 the  loT  it:ed �  HHh[EaiiS:a., ... ,  EaaS,111 local];  Key ;;;  ORBG(,eed)  /  /r - ,,.

A published paper  on EaaS in IEEE Computer magazine generated a lot  of interest among the public, including companies  from the U.S. and Canada who approached the team  and asked for assistance in implementing and hosting  their own EaaS servers. The team started a technology  transfer efort to help with this. The team also continues  the collaboration with a team of researchers at the  University of Florida who work under a NIST research  grant to explore ways to leverage EaaS in protecting  against integrated circuit counterfeiting and thereby  help secure a supply chain. The University of Florida  researchers working on this grant obtained interesting  security results that identifed security vulnerabilities  in widely used protocols for intellectual property  protection in integrated circuit manufacturing and  resulted in proposals for new secure protocols that  eliminated these vulnerabilities.  The team continues to develop the system to  provide a publicly accessible NIST EaaS instance  in FY 2018. The team succeeded in establishing a  non-disclosure agreement and a collaboration with  Intrinsic ID, Inc. – a company with complementing  technology for constructing the initial key on the  client side by extracting it from SRAM memory cells.  The team also established a collaborative relationship  with Crypto4A and 2Keys Corp. from Canada on  51  ITL CYBERSECURITY PROGRAM AND PROJECTS  |  FY 2017  developing a common protocol for EaaS. The team  coordinated with the research team working on the  NIST Beacon for developing common back-end  components for the two services. The team plans to  leverage these common components in the NIST EaaS  implementation.

A block cipher transforms some fxed- length binary data (i.e., a “block” of data) into  seemingly random data of the same length. The  transformation is determined by the choice of some  secret data called the “key.” The same key is used to  reverse the transformation and recover the original  block of data. A cryptographic technique (e.g., for  encryption and/or authentication) that is constructed  from a block cipher is called a “mode of operation.”  Several modes of operation have been specifed  in the SP 800-38 series of publications. The latest  installment in the series, Special Publication 800- 38G, Recommendation for Block Cipher Modes of  Operation: Methods for Format-Preserving Encryption,  was published in 2016. It specifes two AES modes of  operation, called FF1 and FF3, for “format-preserving  encryption” (FPE), based on proposals that were  submitted from the private sector, specifcally, the  payments industry.  Recently, two academic researchers, Vaudenay  and Dürak, developed a cryptanalytic attack on  the FF3 mode. On April 12, 2017, CSD posted an  announcement that summarizes the attack and  outlines CSD’s plans to revise FF3 in a new draft of  SP 800-38G in FY 2018; see https://csrc.nist.gov/  News/2017/Recent-Cryptanalysis-of-FF3.  In FY 2018, CSD also plans to revisit SP 800-38D,  which specifes the Galois/Counter Mode (GCM) for  authenticated encryption. In particular, the security  of GCM depends critically on the requirement for the  uniqueness of the “nonce” input; CSD plans to seek  public comment on how to best update the guidance  for achieving this property.

The CSD began  providing guidance in managing the keys used for  cryptographic applications in the late 1990s to early  2000s. Information on the CSD’s key management  project is available at https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/  key-management.  SP 800-56A, Recommendation for Pair- Wise Key Establishment Schemes Using Discrete  Logarithm Cryptography:  In FY 2017, SP 800-56A was revised. SP 800- 56A was originally published in 2006, and was  previously revised in 2007 and 2013. This document  specifes Dife-Hellman (DH) and Menezes-Qu- Vanstone (MQV) key-agreement schemes, both  elliptic curve and fnite feld versions. Key agreement  results in keying material that is shared between the  participants. A key-agreement scheme is a procedure  in which both parties contribute information that  is used in generating a cryptographic key. A key- agreement scheme is defned by a cryptographic  algorithm, together with other information that must  be available by both parties when establishing keys.  The schemes are intended for use in communication  protocols (e.g., Transport Layer Security (TLS), one  of the protocols used by the Internet). The key- establishment schemes in SP 800-56A use public  key algorithms, and each participant in a key- agreement transaction uses a pair of keys—a public  key and a private key. The key-agreement process  includes the generation of a shared secret (which is 52  https://csrc.nist.gov/News/2017/Recent-Cryptanalysis-of-FF3 https://csrc.nist.gov/News/2017/Recent-Cryptanalysis-of-FF3 https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/block-cipher-techniques https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/block-cipher-techniques mailto:morris.dworkin@nist.gov https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/key-management https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/key-management mailto:apostol.vassilev@nist.gov  NIST/ITL CYBERSECURITY PROGRAM ANNUAL REPORT 2017  Party A (Com mu nications) Pa rty B  Genera t e ·- Generate  Key Pair 1:~ Exch ange Publ ic Keys Key Pair -· ~- l l ' ,  Compute Shared Secret Compute Shared Secret  ! !

Several key-agreement schemes are specifed  in SP 800-56A. Figure 17 below provides a simplifed  example of one of the key-agreement schemes. In this  example, each party:  1. Generates a key pair (either prior to or  during the key-agreement transaction);  2. Obtains the public key of the other party;  3. Computes a shared secret using one’s own  keys and the other party’s public key; and  4. Derives one or more keys from the shared  secret.  A revision of SP 800-56A was provided for public  comment in FY 2017 as a draft of SP 800-56A Rev. 3.  This revision includes the following changes:  • Added the KECCAK Message Authentication  Code (KMAC) to the list of approved MAC  functions; KMAC is specifed in SP 800-185,  SHA-3 Derived Functions: cSHAKE, KMAC,  TupleHash and ParallelHash.  • The elliptic curves to be used in the elliptic  curve Dife-Hellman and MQV schemes will  henceforward be specifed in SP 800-186, a  new publication under development that will  include the elliptic curves currently specifed  in FIPS 186-4, Digital Signature Standard  (DSS), along with additional approved  elliptic curves for key agreement and digital  signatures.  • The key-derivation functions were moved  to SP 800-56C: Recommendation for  Key-Derivation Methods in Key-Derivation  Schemes (see below).  Figure 17: Key-Agreement Example  • Encourages the use of pre-defned domain  parameter groups for the fnite feld Dife- Hellman and MQV schemes. Domain  parameters are used to generate keys and  compute the shared secret. The domain- parameter groups include the “safe primes”  that are used in the Transport Layer Security  (TLS) and Internet Key Exchange (IKE)  protocols.  A more complete list of changes is provided in an  appendix of SP 800-56A Rev. 3. SP 800-56A Rev. 3  will be published in early FY 2018 and will be available  via the CSD publications page at https://csrc.nist.  gov/publications. This web page may also be used to  access FIPS 186-4, SP 800-185, and (eventually) SP  800-186.  53  https://csrc.nist  ITL CYBERSECURITY PROGRAM AND PROJECTS  |  FY 2017  Information about SP 800-56A is also available at  https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800-56a/  rev-3/draft.  SP 800-56C: Recommendation for Key- Derivation Methods in Key-Establishment  Schemes:  SP 800-56C specifes techniques for the derivation  of keys from a shared secret generated during a key- establishment scheme defned in SP 800-56A and SP  800-56B. SP 800-56A is discussed above. SP 800- 56B: Recommendation for Pairwise Key-Establishment  Schemes Using Integer Factorization Cryptography, is  available via https://csrc.nist.gov/publications.  SP 800-56C had included only one method  for key derivation - a two-step key-derivation  procedure that used either the  Keyed-Hash Message  Authentication Code (HMAC) or the Cipher-based  Message Authentication Code (CMAC) algorithm  during the process. HMAC is specifed in FIPS 198- 1: The Keyed-Hash Message Authentication Code  (HMAC), and CMAC is specifed for AES in SP 800- 38B: Recommendation for Block Cipher Modes of  Operation: the CMAC Mode of Authentication. These  documents are available via https://csrc.nist.gov/  publications.  A revision of SP 800-56C was provided for public  comment in FY 2017 as a draft of SP 800-56C Rev. 1.  This revision includes the following changes:  • The single-step key derivation functions  specifed in SP 800-56A and SP 800-56B  were moved into SP 800-56C, as well as the  references to SP 800-135: Recommendation  for Existing Application-Specifc Key  Derivation Functions. Note that the relevant  changes to SP 800-56B (i.e., to remove the  key derivation functions from the document)  have not been performed yet; those changes  will be initiated in FY 2018 (see below).  • KMAC, as specifed in Draft SP 800-185, SHA-3  Derived Functions: cSHAKE, KECCAK Message  Authentication Code (KMAC), TupleHash and  ParallelHash, is allowed for the single-step key  derivation functions.  Changes to the document are discussed in an  appendix of SP 800-56C Rev. 1. SP 800-56A Rev. 3  will be published in early FY 2018 and will be available  via the CSD publications page at https://csrc.nist.gov/  publications. SP 800-135 and SP 800-185 are also  available using that address.  Information on SP 800-56C is also available at  https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800-56c/  rev-1/draft.  New Key Management Publications Under  Development:  A new document was started in FY 2016 on key  storage and recovery by an organization (e.g., key  backup and archiving). This document is intended  to serve as a guideline for the storage and recovery  of cryptographic keys that are not under the direct  control of the entity using those keys (e.g., the owner).  This includes the backup and archiving of copies of  the keys and the metadata associated with them. The  document will also discuss the recovery of those keys  when required (e.g., by the key’s owner or the owner’s  organization).  Plans for FY 2018:  During FY 2018, the CSD is expecting to accomplish  the following key management tasks:  • Publish the revisions of SP 800-56A and SP  800-56C.  • Begin the revision of SP 800-56B and post it  for public comment.  • Begin revisions of SP 800-131A, Transitions:  Recommendation for Transitioning the Use of  Cryptographic Algorithms and Key Lengths,  to address the use of Triple Data Encryption  Algorithm (TDEA), SP 800-56A, SP 800-56B,  KMAC and other SHA-3 derived functions  specifed in SP 800-185. A statement about  the advent of quantum-resistant algorithms  will also be included.  • Begin revisions of SP 800-57, Part 2,  Recommendation for Key Management,  Part 2: Best Practices for Key Management  Organization, to update the guidance.  • Revise SP 800-57, Part 3, Recommendation for  Key Management, Part 3: Application-Specifc  Key Management Guidance, to provide revised 54  https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800-56a/rev-3/draft https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800-56a/rev-3/draft https://csrc.nist.gov/publications https://csrc.nist.gov/publications https://csrc.nist.gov/publications https://csrc.nist.gov/publications https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800-56c/rev-1/draft https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800-56c/rev-1/draft https://csrc.nist.gov/publications  NIST/ITL CYBERSECURITY PROGRAM ANNUAL REPORT 2017  guidance on the use of the Internet Protocol  Security (IPsec) protocol.  • Continue the development of the  organizational key-storage and recovery  publication.  • Resume work on SP 800-71, Recommendation  for Key Establishment Using Symmetric Block  Ciphers.

TLS is a widely used cryptographic protocol that  provides communication security for a variety of  network applications, such as email, e-commerce, and  healthcare.  SP 800-52 was frst published in June of 2005,  and SP 800-52 Revision 1 was published in 2014.  Since the frst revision, CSD has been following  developments in TLS implementations, including  updates and attacks. In FY 2016, a second revision  was initiated that updates TLS recommendations to  include mitigations for recent attacks, synchronizes  cryptographic algorithm recommendations with  other NIST Special Publications, and provides more  fexibility to system administrators in choosing which  TLS features they should support. There is also  guidance for implementations of TLS version 1.3, a  signifcant update to TLS. SP 800-52 Revision 2 will  be posted for public review and comment in FY 2018.  CSD has been contributing to the development  of testssl.sh (see https://github.com/drwetter/testssl.  sh), an open-source program that tests TLS-enabled  servers, providing information about the protocols  and cipher suites supported, in addition to checking  for some well-known faws. In FY 2018, CSD will be  contributing code to testssl.sh that adds support for  TLS version 1.3. When the draft of SP 800-52 Revision  2 is posted for public comment, CSD intends to make a  draft version of this code available that includes some  checks for conformance to SP 800-52 Revision 2.

It is frequently used  to establish Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), requiring  both parties to share keying material, which can be  established using the Internet Key Exchange (IKE)  protocol, and enabling telecommuters or travelers to  gain secure access to their enterprise networks. IPsec  provides the cryptographic security functions for both  versions of the Internet Protocol, IPv4 and IPv6.  CSD has provided cryptographic guidance for  using IPsec and IKE in SP 800-57 part 3, Section 3:  Internet Protocol Security (IPsec). From the beginning  of FY 2017, CSD has been working on a revision of  the section and plans to publish it as a standalone  Special Publication. This SP will update and expand  the existing cryptographic guidelines. The important  technical updates include disallowing Triple DES and  recommending AES-GCM authenticated encryption  instead of the CipherBlock Chaining (CBC) mode.  CSD expects to release the draft SP in FY 2018 for  public comments. The SP will be harmonized with an  upcoming revision of SP 800-77, Guide to IPsec VPNs.  55  https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/key-management/cryptographic-key-management-systems https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/key-management/cryptographic-key-management-systems mailto:elaine.barker@nist.gov mailto:quynh.dang@nist.gov mailto:lily.chen@nist.gov mailto:allen.roginsky@nist.gov https://github.com/drwetter/testssl.sh https://github.com/drwetter/testssl.sh mailto:kerry.mckay@nist.gov mailto:david.cooper@nist.gov http:testssl.sh http:testssl.sh  ITL CYBERSECURITY PROGRAM AND PROJECTS  |  FY 2017  CONTACTS:  Ms. Elaine Barker Mr. Quynh Dang  (301) 975-2911 (301) 975-3610  elaine.barker@nist.gov quynh.dang@nist.gov  Elliptic Curve Cryptography  Elliptic curve cryptography is critical to the  adoption of strong cryptography during the  migration to higher security strengths. One of the  main advantages of elliptic curve cryptography is that  users can achieve the same level of security as other  systems, but with a much shorter key length. NIST has  standardized elliptic curve cryptography for digital  signature algorithms in FIPS 186: Digital Signature  Standard (DSS), and for key establishment schemes  in SP 800-56A: Recommendation for Pair-Wise Key  Establishment Schemes Using Discrete Logarithm  Cryptography.  In FIPS 186-4, NIST recommends 15 elliptic  curves of varying security strengths for use in these  elliptic curve cryptographic standards. However, the  provenance of the curves is not fully specifed in the  standard, leading to recent public concerns that there  could be a hidden weakness in these curves. NIST is  not aware of any vulnerability in these curves when  they are implemented correctly and used as described  in NIST standards and guidelines.  More than 15 years have now passed since these  curves were developed, and the community now  knows more about the security of elliptic curve  cryptography and practical implementation issues.  Advances within the cryptographic community have  led to the development of new elliptic curves and  algorithms whose designers claim to ofer better  performance and are easier to implement in a secure  manner. Some of these curves are under consideration  in voluntary, consensus-based Standards Developing  Organizations.  In FY 2017, NIST utilized feedback received to revise  and improve FIPS 186-4. In particular, NIST plans to  add new elliptic curves to the current recommended  set. The entire collection of recommended curves and  their specifcation will be moved to a new publication  SP 800-186: Recommendations for Discrete- Logarithm Based Cryptography: Elliptic Curve Domain  Parameters. In addition, new deterministic digital  signature schemes will be included in FIPS 186. It is  expected that the revised draft version of FIPS 186-5  (and SP 800-186) will be available for public comment  in early FY 2018.

If large-scale quantum  computers are ever built, they will be able to break  the existing infrastructure of public-key cryptography  (see Table 1). The focus of the Post-Quantum  Cryptography (PQC) project is to identify candidate  quantum-resistant systems that are secure against  both quantum and classical computers—as well as the  impact that such post-quantum algorithms will have  on current protocols and security infrastructures.  NIST researchers have held regular seminars  throughout FY 2017. The presentation topics included  the latest published results and security analyses, as  well as status reports on quantum computation, hash- based signatures, coding-based cryptography, lattice- based cryptography, and multivariate cryptography.  Through these presentations and discussions, the  project team has made signifcant progress in  understanding the strengths and weaknesses of the  existing cryptographic schemes in each category.  The NIST team also continues to be productive  in post-quantum cryptography research. The results  have been published at major conferences, such as  Real World Cryptography, Number Theory Methods in  Cryptography, Selected Areas in Cryptography, Post- Quantum Cryptography (PQCrypto), and AsiaCrypt.

NIST has also sponsored other research,  education, and research events.  In 2016, NIST published NISTIR 8105: Report  on Post-Quantum Cryptography, which shared the  team’s current understanding about the status of  quantum computing and post-quantum cryptography.  Shortly thereafter, NIST began the Post-Quantum  Standardization Process, a thorough multi-year  efort with the objective of creating new quantum- resistant cryptographic standards for public-key  encryption and digital signatures (see https://www.  nist.gov/pqcrypto). These functionalities are much  more complex than AES or SHA-3, and will require  fundamentally new techniques to address several  open research questions in this area (for example, how  to measure security against quantum attacks when a  quantum computer has not yet been built). Submitters  from around the world are invited to propose  quantum-resistant cryptosystems for consideration  by NIST as part of the PQC standardization process.  In December 2016, after resolving and assessing  public comments, NIST issued the fnal submission  requirements and evaluation criteria. NIST has  received several proposals, and the fnal submission  deadline is in November 2017.  In FY 2018, NIST will continue to explore the  security and feasibility of purported quantum- resistant technologies submitted to the Post-Quantum  Standardization Process. NIST will hold a public  workshop in April 2018, co-located with the PQCrypto  conference in Florida, during which submitters will be  invited to present their algorithms. The Post-Quantum  Standardization Process will proceed with multiple  rounds of public evaluation and analysis, with the goal  of selecting algorithms for standardization by NIST  after three to fve years of analysis.

In practice, it is important to be able to  reduce the size and depth of these circuits. Size impacts  energy consumption and power requirements. Depth  largely determines the speed at which the functions  are evaluated by the circuit. This reduction problem  is closely related to designing small (and low-depth)  combinational circuits, which contain only logical  gates (i.e., no registers are used, and there is no clock).  Figure 18 below shows one such circuit, for performing  inversion in GF(24).  Finding optimal combinational circuits is MAX- SNP Complete. In practice, this means that it is  necessary to settle for methods that design “good”  circuits, as opposed to provably optimal circuits. CSD  has developed and implemented new solutions for  the circuit-minimization problem. There is a tradeof  between the size and depth of circuits. Heuristics that  do well with respect to one of these metrics tend to do  so at the expense of the other one. In cooperation with  colleagues at the University of Southern Denmark,  CSD developed a new heuristic that simultaneously  reduces size and depth.

For a function  to be secure (in particular, one-way), it must be the  case that any circuit that implements it is sufciently  complex. In particular, a function is insecure if it can be  implemented by a circuit containing too few Boolean  AND gates. This security metric — the number of AND  gates necessary and sufcient to implement a function  — is called multiplicative complexity. Unfortunately,  determining multiplicative complexity is extremely  hard. In previous years, the CSD was able to determine  the multiplicative complexity of all Boolean functions  on up to fve input bits. This year the team was able  to do the same for all functions on six inputs (there  are 264 such functions). ITL was able to exhibit specifc  functions on n bits which are impossible to calculate  with fewer than n AND gates. Also as a result of  this classifcation, it was possible to determine the  multiplicative complexity of the symmetric function  S(8,4) – problems that had remained unresolved for  many years.  Secure multi-party computation is a technique  that allows a group of people to compute a function of  their inputs without revealing the inputs themselves.  Examples of this are: 1) holding an election; 2)  conducting closed-bid auctions in which only the  winning bid is determined; 3) proving to a third party  that a person’s encrypted attributes satisfy some  requirement, such as being “over 21 and (U.S. citizen  or Canadian citizen)”. The protocols that solve secure  multi-party computation problems often encrypt  bits using arithmetic modulo 2. The complexity of  such protocols largely depends on the number of  multiplications required. Hence, expressing functions  as a circuit with only a few multiplication (AND) gates  is important. Some of the circuits published are now  a standard reference for the benchmarking of secure  multi-party computation protocols.  The results on circuit size and depth, and on  multiplicative complexity were presented at the 2nd  International Workshop on Boolean Functions and  their Applications (Bergen, Norway). Circuits are  periodically posted at https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/  Circuit-Complexity/Circuit-Problems.

Examples  of these areas include automotive systems, sensor  networks, healthcare, distributed control systems,  the Internet of Things (IoT), cyber-physical systems,  and the smart grid. Security and privacy can be very  important in these areas. Because most of the modern  cryptographic algorithms were designed for desktop/  server environments, many of these algorithms  cannot be implemented in the constrained devices  used by these applications. When current NIST- approved algorithms can be engineered to ft into  the limited resources of constrained environments,  their performance may not be acceptable. For these  reasons, NIST started a lightweight cryptography  project in 2013 that was tasked with determining the  need and developing a strategy for the standardization  of lightweight cryptographic algorithms.  In October 2016, CSD held the Second Lightweight  Cryptography Workshop for representatives from  government, industry, and academia. The workshop led  to the publication of NISTIR 8114, Report on Lightweight  Cryptography. This report provides an overview of  the lightweight cryptography project at NIST, and  describes a plan for the standardization of lightweight  cryptographic algorithms. A draft whitepaper, Profles  for the Lightweight Cryptography Standardization  Process, was released for public comment in order  to receive community feedback on the goals for the  frst set of NIST lightweight cryptography standards.  The functionality that will be requested for this frst  set of standards are authenticated encryption with  associated data (AEAD) with optional hashing. A  call for algorithm submissions for the lightweight  cryptography portfolio will be announced in FY 2018,  along with details of the selection process.  NISTIR 8114 and the Lightweight Cryptography  project were featured in the June 2017 ITL bulletin,  and CSD presented a poster on the project during  ITL Science Day in October 2016. The Lightweight  Cryptography project was presented at several venues  in FY 2017, including Real World Crypto, HighLight:  High Security Lightweight Cryptography, and the rump  sessions of the Eurocrypt and Crypto conferences.

Such  heterogeneous networks demand integrated security  solutions. CSD has worked closely with diferent  working groups in the IEEE 802 LAN/MAN Standards  Committee since 2006 and made solid contributions  to the security solutions for wireless networks. The  NIST team has been involved in the IEEE 802.11 and  IEEE 802.21 working groups to develop standards  for cryptographic key management schemes for the  mobility environment. NIST cryptographic standards  have been extensively used in the wireless standards  developed in the IEEE 802 community.  In FY 2017, NIST researchers continuously  collaborated with the IEEE 802.21 Working Group.  IEEE 802.21 “Media Independent Handover Services  Framework” was published, and IEEE 802.21.1 “Media  Independent Services” was fnalized for publication.  These new standards address the future connectivity  and management requirements of Smart Grid, IoT and  Smart Home networks, where multimode wireless  devices and smart end nodes incorporate diferent  wireless interfaces, and need to switch among the  networks during an ongoing communication session,  while maintaining the same security posture. IEEE  802.21 and IEEE 802.21.1 adopted NIST standardized  cryptographic algorithms, such as ECDSA, as specifed  in FIPS 186-4, and AES-CCM, as specifed in SP 800- 38C.  59  https://www.nist.gov/programs-projects/lightweight-cryptography https://www.nist.gov/programs-projects/lightweight-cryptography https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/itl-bulletin/2017/06/toward-standardizing-lightweight-cryptography/final https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/itl-bulletin/2017/06/toward-standardizing-lightweight-cryptography/final https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/itl-bulletin/2017/06/toward-standardizing-lightweight-cryptography/final mailto:lawrence.bassham@nist.gov mailto:kerry.mckay@nist.gov mailto:meltem.turan@nist.gov  ITL CYBERSECURITY PROGRAM AND PROJECTS  |  FY 2017  Tlmestamp  Nonce  Tim e  Tlmestamp  Nonce  T1mestamp  Nonce  The recently revealed KRACK attack on the IEEE  802.11 wireless network leads to generating the same  key stream in the case of AES-CCM, or recovering the  authentication key, in the case of AES-GCM through  a man-in-the-middle attack to create a counter  reset condition. The KRACK attack confrms that it is  essential to make sure that the special features and  assumptions for using each cryptographic algorithm  are considered in the protocol design so that the  requirements are satisfed to assure security in any  circumstance.  In FY 2018, CSD will continue to contribute to IEEE  802 wireless standards. CSD will work with the IEEE  802.11 working group to develop countermeasures for  the KRACK attack.  CONTACT:  Dr. Lily Chen  (301) 975 -6974  lily.chen@nist.gov  Blockchains  CSD began studying the use of blockchains,  which have been suggested as a solution for  many applications. A  blockchain  is a distributed  database that maintains a continuously growing  list of records called blocks that are secured from  undetected modifcation using a hash function.  Each block contains a link to the previous block. A  new block is added to the chain only when multiple  parties (possibly mutually untrusted parties) agree  to its accuracy. In essence, a blockchain is a mutually  agreed-upon record of history.  Figure 19 illustrates three blocks in a blockchain,  where each block contains at least one transaction, a  nonce and the hash value of the previous block in the  chain.  The most well-known example of the use of a  blockchain is BitCoin and similar digital currencies.  However, the use of blockchains has been proposed  for other applications, such as smart contracts and  various ledgering applications.  Many organizations have suggested applications  for the use of blockchains, some of which may not  be appropriate. CSD is investigating the use of  blockchains to determine which application types are  appropriate for using blockchains and which are not.  CSD is monitoring the proposed uses of cryptography  to assure that current cryptographic techniques  are used properly and whether new techniques are  required.  During FY 2017, NIST participated in standards  activities exploring blockchain technologies,  architectures, and use cases. These included  participation in a new blockchain study group  sponsored by American Standards Committee X9,  the fnancial services committee of the American  National Standards Institute (ANSI), and continued  work in the International Standards Organization  (ISO) Technical Committee (TC) for Blockchains  and Distributed Ledger Technologies (ISO/TC 307).  Established in 2016, the initial objectives of ISO/TC 307  include defning key terms and concepts, exploring  reference architectures, investigating use cases, and  identifying identity and privacy implications within  blockchain technologies and architectures. NIST has  Figure 19: Example of a Blockchain 60  mailto:lily.chen@nist.gov  NIST/ITL CYBERSECURITY PROGRAM ANNUAL REPORT 2017  been participating in these activities via the national  mirror committee within the InterNational Committee  for Information Technology Standards (INCITS). ISO/  TC 307 will meet in November 2017, where the reports  on these topics will be reviewed and new work will be  established.  During FY 2017, CSD established the NIST Internal  Blockchain Workbench to support internal research  exploring blockchain technologies and use cases.  The workbench itself is hosted on internal servers,  and is currently running two blockchains – the frst  is a permissioned blockchain utilizing the MultiChain  blockchain platform; the second is Ethereum,  which has been confgured to run only within the  workbench. In addition to the blockchain software  itself, the workbench has demonstration applications  with source code, software development tools and  several diagnostic tool suites available for researchers  to utilize. NIST/ITL plans to continue advancing the  capabilities of the workbench and expanding the  types of blockchains available in FY 2018.

Poor implementations of these standards  or specifcations may render a product insecure,  potentially placing sensitive information at risk. ITL  operates several validation programs that help provide  a level of assurance that products meet established  security requirements and conform to published  specifcations. To that end, the CSD develops test  suites and test methods; provides implementation  guidance and technical support to industry forums;  and conducts education, training, and outreach  programs.  CSD’s validation programs work together with  independent laboratories that are accredited by the  National Voluntary Laboratory Accreditation Program  (NVLAP). Based on independent laboratory test  reports and test evidence provided by the labs, the  validation programs described below validate the  implementation-under-test. Awarded validations are  subsequently published on NIST websites.  Cryptographic Algorithm Validation  Program (CAVP)  The Cryptographic Algorithm Validation Program  (CAVP) provides federal agencies in the United States  and Canada with assurance that a cryptographic  algorithm has been implemented completely  and correctly, as specifed in its approved Federal  Information Processing Standard (FIPS-Approved)  or NIST-recommended cryptographic algorithm  standard. The CAVP was established in 2013 as a  joint program in collaboration between NIST and  the Communications Security Establishment (CSE)  of Canada. Prior to this date, the CAVP’s functions  were included in the Cryptographic Module Validation  Program (CMVP). With the increase in the number and  complexity of FIPS-Approved and NIST-recommended  cryptographic algorithms, it was deemed necessary  to establish the CAVP as an independent program.  The CAVP’s goal is to provide federal agencies with  a security metric list to use in validating cryptographic  algorithm implementations, and promote the use  of validated algorithms by industry and the public.  The testing is carried out by independent third- party laboratories accredited by the NVLAP, and  the validations performed by the CAVP program  provide this metric. Federal agencies, industry, and  the public can choose validated implementations  of cryptographic algorithms from the CAVP  Validated Algorithms List and have confdence in the  claimed level of security and assurance of correct  implementation.  The validation of cryptographic algorithms 61  mailto:ebarker@nist.gov mailto:john.kelsey@nist.gov mailto:rene.peralta@nist.gov mailto:andrew.regenscheid@nist.gov mailto:dylan.yaga@nist.gov  ITL CYBERSECURITY PROGRAM AND PROJECTS  |  FY 2017  by the CAVP is a prerequisite to the validation of a  cryptographic module by the CMVP and is also used by  other programs outside of NIST as well. Since federal  agencies are required to use validated cryptographic  modules for the protection of sensitive unclassifed  information, the validated modules and the validated  algorithms that the modules contain represent the  culmination and delivery of CSD’s cryptography- based work to the end user.  The CAVP validation program provides  documented methodologies for conformance testing  through defned sets of security requirements. For  the CAVP, a validation system document is designed  for each FIPS-approved or NIST-recommended  cryptographic algorithm. See the website for a listing  (see https://csrc.nist.gov/groups/STM/cavp/). The  four Annexes to FIPS 140-2 reference the underlying  cryptographic algorithm standards or methods.  By the end of FY 2017, the CAVP had issued  approximately 28,710 validations, representing the  algorithm validations of approximately 18 approved  algorithms, including 5 modes of operation.

The increase in  validations is attributed to an increase in cryptographic  modules being validated and other outside programs  now requiring CAVP validated implementations,  e.g., the National Information Assurance Partnership  (NIAP).  The number of algorithms submitted for validation  continues to grow, representing signifcant growth in  the number of validations expected to be available in  the future.

Cryptographic Module Validation  Program (CMVP)  The Cryptographic Module Validation Program  (CMVP) was developed to support the federal user  communities for strong, independently tested, and  commercially available cryptographic modules.  Through this program, the CMVP works with  international government, public and private sectors  as a part of the cryptographic community to achieve  standards-based security and assurance of correct  implementation. The goal is to provide federal  agencies with a security metric list to use in procuring  and deploying validated cryptographic modules, and  promote the use of those modules by industry and  the public. The testing performed by independent  third-party laboratories accredited by NVLAP, and the  validations performed by the CMVP program provide  this metric. Federal agencies, industry, and the public  can choose cryptographic modules and/or products  containing cryptographic modules from the CMVP  Validated Modules List and have confdence in the  claimed level of security and assurance of correct  implementation.  Cryptographic module testing and validation are  based on published NIST standards. Since federal  agencies are required to use validated cryptographic  modules for the protection of sensitive unclassifed  information, the validated modules and the validated  algorithms that the modules contain represent the  culmination and delivery of the CSD’s cryptography- based work to the end user.  The CMVP validates modules that are used in a  wide variety of products, including Internet browsers,  radios, smart cards, space-based communications,  munitions, security tokens, mobile phones, network  and storage devices, and products supporting  the Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) and electronic  commerce. A module may be a standalone product,  such as a virtual private network (VPN) or smart card,  or it could be a module embedded in many products,  such as a cryptographic-based toolkit. As a result, a  small number of modules may be incorporated within  hundreds of products.  The theme for FY 2017 was modernization. As part  of the launch of the new Computer Security Resource  Center (CSRC) web site, the CMVP web pages were  redesigned and now have a new look with additional  functionality. The CMVP was automated to improve  its validation processes, the Cryptographic Validation  Program (CVP) Certifcation Exam was developed, and  collaboration was continued with the Cryptographic  Modules User Forum (CMUF) to publish new CMVP  Implementation Guidance (IG).  The CMVP uses an automation system to manage  the validation workfow. This automation continues to  reduce the administrative overhead for the program  allowing the staf to focus on addressing the technical  needs of the community. The automated system tracks  the status of each submission and identifes the order  that the submission should be reviewed, based on  when the submission was added to the CMVP queue.  In FY 2017, the CMVP awarded 271 new certifcates.  Figure 23 displays the number of certifcates that  were issued by security level.  64  https://csrc.nist.gov/groups/computer-security-division/security-testing-validation-and-measurement https://csrc.nist.gov/groups/computer-security-division/security-testing-validation-and-measurement https://csrc.nist.gov/groups/computer-security-division/security-testing-validation-and-measurement mailto:harold.booth@nist.gov  NIST/ITL CYBERSECURITY PROGRAM ANNUAL REPORT 2017  • • • •  138, 51%  103, 38%  28, 10% 2, 1%  FY 2017 CMVP Certificates  271 Total  Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Level 4  Figure 23: FY 2017 CMVP  Certifcates by Security Level  Initially, this system automated the creation and  transmittal of billing invoices, but then was further  enhanced to allow laboratories to submit those  invoices in advance of the report submission. For  laboratories and vendors who elect to take advantage  of this, the amount of time that submissions wait in  the queue prior to being assigned has been reduced,  which in turn lessens the overall time to validation.  This enhancement provides signifcant time savings  and was achieved due to the continued collaborative  efort between the CMVP and NIST Receivables.  In order to provide a greater transparency to  the laboratories, the CMVP sends a weekly report to  each laboratory providing a status of each of their  submissions. The CMVP provides those reports to  apprise the laboratories of the current state of each  submission along with their respective payment  status. This has mitigated the number of status  requests that need to be addressed by the CMVP.  Since August 2015, the CMVP produces a separate  Implementation Under Test (IUT) list from the  Modules In Process (MIP) list. The IUT list is merely  provided as a marketing service for vendors. However,  to encourage this list to be kept up to date, the CMVP  implemented a new policy to drop IUT entries that are  greater than 18 months old. The MIP list continues to  refect the status of the current work that is actively in  the validation process.  In February 2017, the CMVP adopted the fve  year Validation Sunsetting Policy that moved all  FIPS 140-1 validation entries and all validations that  were completed prior to February 1, 2012 from the  Active Validation List to the Historical Validation  List. This was done to ensure that modules on the  Active Validation List are compliant with the latest  standards and guidance. In January 2018, the CMVP  will drop modules to the historical list that have not  been validated within two years of report or billing  submission, whichever occurred frst. This is to  encourage the completion of projects and to ensure  that the MIP list refects modules that are actively in  the validation process.  In order to demonstrate profciency in the  technical areas addressed by Handbook 150-17,  NVLAP Cryptographic and Security Testing, the  CMVP activated the CVP Certifcation Exam in July  2017. This exam is now required as part of the initial  and renewal accreditation process. The profciency  testing was previously handled by the NVLAP/  CMVP technical assessors at the onsite audit, but is  now being managed through a third-party testing  facility. Each laboratory must have a minimum of two  testers who pass the exam to be eligible for initial or  renewal accreditation. The certifcation will remain  with the individual tester making it easier to access  the laboratory’s overall competency, as its staf may  change over time. In support of this efort, the CMVP  also created a web site and user’s guide that provides  information on this new certifcation process.  In September 2017, the NIST CSRC launched a new  website. In support of that efort, the CMVP updated  its web pages to include both basic and advanced  search capabilities. The basic search results in the list  of all active validated modules. The more advanced  search allows the user to search on specifc felds  and to retrieve historical and revoked certifcates. For  each validation, there are links provided to related  fles that direct the user to the module’s security  policy and to the applicable consolidated certifcate.  The consolidated certifcates are generated once a  month and include the individual validations that  were completed within that particular month. The  posting of the most current CMVP IG document was  also separated from the archived versions that are still  accessible for historical reference.  65  ITL CYBERSECURITY PROGRAM AND PROJECTS  |  FY 2017  The CMVP has maintained the relationship with  the CMUF by supporting the monthly CMUF general  membership meetings and the CMUF working  groups. The working groups are chaired by a member  of industry and/or laboratory personnel. Each  working group includes a representative from the  CMVP. The current working group tasks include the  Revalidation and Response to Common Vulnerabilities  and Exposures (CVEs), ROM Integrity Testing in  Constrained Devices, and Testing Equivalency.  Working groups are dissolved once discussions on  the topics are completed, and guidance is typically  published.  In order to provide predicable support for  vendors and laboratories needing guidance, the  CMVP implemented a quarterly IG release process.  New draft IGs and revisions to currently posted IGs  are sent out once a month to the laboratories for  comments. Vendors are encouraged to provide their  feedback, so draft IGs are also posted on the CMUF  Forum. The comments are adjudicated by the CMVP,  and the fnalized IGs are incorporated into the main  IG document, which is posted quarterly on the CMVP  web site.  For FY 2018, the CMVP is anticipating the approval  of FIPS 140-3. When approved, the CMVP will create  the necessary documents and processes to support  the transition from FIPS 140-2 to FIPS 140-3. The  CMVP will continue to:  • Invest in automation to streamline the  validation process and improve review  consistency,  • Strengthen its relationship with the CMUF by  collaborating on new and improved technical  guidance and programmatic issues, and  • Support the ICMC committee to continue  strengthening the relationship with vendors  and laboratories.

FIPS 140-2 was released on May 25, 2001  and supersedes FIPS 140-1.  The current implementation of the CMVP is shown  in Figure 24 below. The CMVP leverages the National  Voluntary Laboratory Accreditation Program (NVLAP)  accredited Cryptographic and Security Testing (CST)  laboratories for validation testing against the Derived  Test Requirements (DTR), Implementation Guidance  (IG), and applicable CMVP programmatic guidance.  According to existing guidance, the CST laboratories  must perform 100 % independent testing of the  modules submitted by the vendors.  The structure and the rules under which the CMVP  operates worked well for the level of the technology  utilized by the Federal Government when the  program was created more than two decades ago. As  technology progresses and cryptography becomes  ubiquitous in the federal IT infrastructure, the plethora  of cryptographic module validations has proven  to outstrip available human resources for vendors,  third-party testing laboratories and federal validators  alike. As the number and complexity of modules to  be validated increases, the existing methodologies  face a limit on their ability to catch and eliminate all  possible defects that could compromise the security.  Testing is exceedingly long — well beyond typical  product-development cycles across a wide range of  technologies — yet costly and inefective. The resulting  validated modules often do not provide useful  interfaces for integration into IT systems to enable  run-time monitoring of modules for compliance with  FISMA.  66  https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/cryptographic-module-validation-program/module-validation-lists https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/cryptographic-module-validation-program/module-validation-lists https://wsr.pearsonvue.com/nist-cmvp mailto:beverly.trapnell@nist.gov  NIST/ITL CYBERSECURITY PROGRAM ANNUAL REPORT 2017  Acc redit ed  Cryp1t10gr~ ph le i!!ind  5' uri y Tes.ti i  Laboratory  IVT  • La!b performs  conform :e tes- • P!1lparl?'S-tl:'f.t  report  Crypto rap hie  Mo-du le Tes.t  Ri!!!port  IUT  • vendor reques.fS Mal da oo al lmpleiromiatlon  • subm rs the modlll fortes 118 Cryp •osra p i,c  Modu I!' vl!'n d or  cvlcw- • WIM!n Is ln•roice k p,ald,  cwo CMVP rel/le ers a e  a99i.!lned and r~ili'l' t the  submitted documients  • CMVP POC is ~ne,cl tu  n nage t!M! coo rdlnaoon  phas.e  and . 40-2 Cry-ptogra ph le  Module5-Li.st  ltttp;f/<= ,ri st.ii<'Y/'1:ro\\lP~Tl\\1f,::nmi/d~140-1/1dl]y all ,h  Figure 24: Current Validation Flow  NIST recognizes the need to improve the efciency  and efectiveness of cryptographic module testing  to reduce the time and cost required for testing,  while providing a high level of assurance for Federal  Government consumers.  The principal goals of this project are to  collaborate with commercial or open source producers  of cryptographic capabilities and government  consumers of FIPS 140-validated modules to:  • Improve the efciency and efectiveness of  cryptographic module testing by adopting the  best practices used by industry;  • Develop test procedures and techniques that  provide assurance of module compliance  to FIPS 140 in an automated manner, based  on machine-readable artifacts or evidence  (examples of machine readable artifacts are  XML or JavaScript Object Notation (JSON)  fles containing logs from performed tests and  the corresponding results – see examples at  https://github.com/usnistgov/ACVP); and  • Identify techniques and procedures that  provide continued assurance of operational  compliance to FIPS 140 for cryptographic  modules throughout their lifecycle.  The scope of this project is broken into multiple  phases to be performed over several years:  Phase 1  • Identify potential approaches,  • Select the best technical approach or  approaches to prototype, and  • Document the technical approach.  Phase 2  • Develop working prototypes, and  • Evaluate the prototypes against the principal  goals.

(SHA-2)  The conformance testing consists of a suite of  validation tests for each approved cryptographic  algorithm. These validation tests exercise the  algorithmic requirements and mathematical  formulas to assure that the detailed specifcations  are implemented correctly and completely. If the  implementer deviates from the specifcations in the  standard or excludes any part of these specifcations  or requirements, the validation test will detect the  deviations and fail. The validation testing will indicate  that the algorithm implementation does not function  properly or is incomplete.  The cryptographic algorithm validation tests  designed and developed by the CAVP are used by  independent third-party laboratories accredited by  NVLAP. The laboratory works with vendors to validate  their cryptographic algorithm implementations. The  suite of validation tests for each algorithm ensures the  repeatability of tests and the equivalency of results  across the testing laboratories.  There are several types of validation tests, all  designed to satisfy the testing requirements of the  cryptographic algorithms and their specifcations.  These include Known-Answer Tests, Monte Carlo  Tests, and Multi-Block Message Tests. The Known- Answer Tests are designed to examine the individual  components of the algorithm by supplying known  values to the variables and verifying the expected  result. Negative testing is also performed by  supplying known incorrect values to assure that  the implementation recognizes values that are not  allowed. The Monte Carlo Test is designed to exercise  the entire implementation-under-test (IUT). This test  is designed to detect the presence of implementation  faws that are not detected with the controlled input of  the Known-Answer Tests. The types of implementation  faws detected by this validation test include pointer  problems, insufcient allocation of space, improper  error handling, and incorrect behavior of the IUT.  The Multi-Block Message Test (MMT) is designed  to test the ability of the implementation to process  multi-block messages, which requires the chaining of  information from one block to the next.  During the last few years, CSD has expanded  its publications to contain not only the algorithm’s  specifcations, but also requirements for an algorithm’s  use. Many of these usage requirements do not fall  within the scope of the CAVP, because the CAVP  focuses on the correctness of the instructions within  the algorithm’s boundary. If these additional algorithm  usage requirements are not considered applicable  to the algorithm’s implementation, they cannot be  tested at the algorithm level by the CAVP, but may be  tested by the CMVP if the requirements are considered  applicable to the cryptographic module. However,  some of these usage requirements may be outside  the scope of both the algorithm implementation  and cryptographic module. In this latter case, the  fulfllment of the requirements is the responsibility of  entities using, installing, or confguring applications or  protocols that use the cryptographic algorithms. For  example, depending on the design of a cryptographic  module, it may not be possible for the module to  determine whether a specifc key is used for multiple  purposes, a situation that is strongly discouraged.  The CAVP currently has algorithm validation  testing for the following cryptographic algorithms:  Credit: Shutterstock/Olivier Le Moal  Various Types of SHAs  69  ITL CYBERSECURITY PROGRAM AND PROJECTS  |  FY 2017  CRYPTOGRAPHIC  ALGORITHM/COMPONENT  FEDERAL INFORMATION PROCESSING  STANDARD (FIPS), SPECIAL PUBLICATION  (SP) OR OTHER REFERENCE DOCUMENT  Triple Data Encryption Standard (TDES)  SP 800-67, Recommendation for the Triple Data  Encryption Algorithm (TDEA) Block Cipher, and  SP 800-38A, Recommendation for Block Cipher  Modes of Operation–Methods and Techniques  Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)  FIPS 197, Advanced Encryption Standard, and  SP 800-38A, Recommendation for Block Cipher  Modes of Operation–Methods and Techniques  Digital Signature Algorithm (DSA)  FIPS 186-2, Digital Signature Standard (DSS), with  change notice 1 and  FIPS 186-4, Digital Signature Standard (DSS)  Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm  (ECDSA)  FIPS 186-2, Digital Signature Standard (DSS), with  change notice 1 and ANS X9.62 and  FIPS 186-4, Digital Signature Standard (DSS) and  ANS X9.62  RSA Algorithm  FIPS 186-4, Digital Signature Standard (DSS) and  ANS X9.31 and Public Key Cryptography Standards  (PKCS) #1 v2.1: RSA Cryptography Standard-2002  Hashing algorithms SHA-1, SHA-224, SHA-256, SHA- 384, SHA-512, SHA-512/224, SHA-512/256  FIPS 180-4, Secure Hash Standard (SHS)  Hashing algorithms SHA3-224, SHA3-256, SHA3-384,  SHA3-512  FIPS 202, SHA-3 Standard: Permutation-Based Hash  and Extendable-Output Functions, August 2015  SHA-3 Extendable-Output Functions (XOFs)  SHAKE128, SHAKE256  FIPS 202, SHA-3 Standard: Permutation-Based Hash  and Extendable-Output Functions, August 2015  Random Number Generator (RNG) algorithms  FIPS 186-2 Appendix 3.1 and 3.2; ANS X9.62  Appendix A.4  Deterministic Random Bit Generators (DRBG)  SP 800-90A, Recommendation for Random  Number Generation Using Deterministic Random Bit  Generators  Keyed-Hash Message Authentication Code (HMAC)  using SHA-1, SHA-2 and SHA-3  FIPS 198-1, The Keyed-Hash Message Authentication  Code (HMAC)  Cipher-based Message Authentication Code (CMAC)  Mode for Authentication  SP 800-38B, Recommendation for Block Cipher  Modes of Operation: The CMAC Mode for  Authentication  TABLE 2: CRYPTOGRAPHIC ALGORITHMS & NIST TECHNICAL DOCUMENTS (FIPS & SPs)  70  NIST/ITL CYBERSECURITY PROGRAM ANNUAL REPORT 2017  TABLE 2 (CONT): CRYPTOGRAPHIC ALGORITHMS & NIST TECHNICAL DOCUMENTS  (FIPS & SPs)  CRYPTOGRAPHIC  ALGORITHM/COMPONENT  FEDERAL INFORMATION PROCESSING  STANDARD (FIPS), SPECIAL PUBLICATION  (SP) OR OTHER REFERENCE DOCUMENT  Counter with Cipher Block Chaining-Message  Authentication Code (CCM) Mode  SP 800-38C, Recommendation for Block  Cipher Modes of Operation: the CCM Mode for  Authentication and Confdentiality  GCM, Galois Message Authentication Code (GMAC), and  eXtended Packet Number (XPN) Modes  SP 800-38D, Recommendation for Block Cipher  Modes of Operation: Galois/Counter Mode (GCM)  and GMAC  XTS-AES Mode XOR–encrypt–XOR (XEX) Tweakable  Block Cipher with Ciphertext  Stealing mode  SP 800-38E, Recommendation for Block Cipher  Modes of Operation: The XTS-AES Mode for  Confdentiality on Block-Oriented Storage Devices  Key Wrapping  SP 800-38F, Recommendation for Block Cipher  Modes of Operation: Methods for Key Wrapping  DH and MQV Key Agreement Schemes and Key  Confrmation  SP 800-56A, Recommendation for Pair-Wise Key  Establishment Schemes Using Discrete Logarithm  Cryptography, dated March 2007  All of SP 800-56A schemes without the Key Derivation  Functions (KDF)  SP 800-56A, Key Derivation Functions for Key  Agreement Schemes: All sections except Section  5.8  SP 800-56A Section 5.7.1.2 ECC CDH function  SP 800-56A, Section 5.7.1.2 Elliptic Curve  Cryptography Cofactor Dife-Hellman (ECC CDH)  Primitive Testing  Key-Based Key Derivation functions (KBKDF)  SP 800-108, Recommendation for Key Derivation  using Pseudorandom Functions  Application-Specifc Key Derivation functions (ASKDF)  (includes the KDFs used by Internet Key Exchange (IKE)  v1, IKEv2, Transport Layer Security (TLS), American  National Standard (ANS) X9.63-2001, Secure Shell (SSH),  Secure Real-time Transport Protocol  (SRTP), Simple  Network Management Protocol (SNMP), and Trusted  Platform Module (TPM)  SP 800-135 (Revision 1) Recommendation for  Existing Application-Specifc key Derivation  Functions  Component test – ECDSA Signature Generation of a hash  value (This component test verifes the signing of a hash- sized input.

Security Content Automation  Protocol (SCAP) Validation Program  The SCAP Validation Program performs  conformance testing to ensure that products correctly  implement SCAP, as defned in SP 800-126 Revision 2,  The Technical Specifcation for the Security Content  Automation Protocol (SCAP): SCAP Version 1.2.  Conformance testing is necessary because SCAP is a  complex collection of eleven individual specifcations  that work together to support various use cases. A  single error in product implementation could result  in undetected vulnerabilities or policy noncompliance  within an organization’s networks.  The test requirements for SCAP 1.2 are defned  in NISTIR 7511, Security Content Automation  Protocol (SCAP) Version 1.2 Validation Program  Test Requirements. In general, vendors may opt for  product validation for one or more SCAP capabilities  or operating systems. Currently, the program ofers  testing on Microsoft Windows, Red Hat Enterprise  Linux, and Apple Mac OS platforms. The validation  process starts when a vendor voluntarily submits  an SCAP-enabled product to an NVLAP-accredited  laboratory. Once the lab completes product testing,  the lab submits a test report to the SCAP Validation  Program at NIST for review. NIST reviews the test  report and awards a validation if all requirements  have been met. Once a validation is awarded, the  SCAP Validation Record is sent to the lab, and the  information about the newly validated product is  posted on the SCAP Validated Products web page.

The most current  NISTIR 7511 revision, as well as SCAP capabilities and  supported platforms, are available on the home page  (see https://scap.nist.gov/validation). The resources  page includes documentation, a list of Frequently  Asked Questions (FAQ), the SCAP validation-test  content, and tools for validating and processing  SCAP data streams. The SCAP validation-test content  should be used by vendors for quality assurance  testing prior to entering formal SCAP testing with an  NVLAP-accredited laboratory. The open-source tools  that are available for download may be used by SCAP  content authors for testing the SCAP source content.  The SCAP Content Validation Tool (SCAPVal) may  be used to determine if the content conforms to the  SCAP specifcation. SCAP validated products may  be used to process SCAP data streams for use cases  such as checking compliance of target systems to a  confguration checklist.  End users may use information on the SCAP  Validation web page to learn about SCAP validation  and fnd products that have been awarded validations.  The validation records that are posted on the SCAP  Validated Products page identify the product versions  that were tested in the laboratory, along with details  about each validation, such as the tested platforms,  SCAP capabilities, the validation test suite version,  and the lab that performed the product test.  In FY 2017, NISTIR 7511 was updated in  preparation for testing conformance to SCAP 1.3,  and the validation test content was updated to  include test coverage for SCAP 1.3 and support for  new platforms. Support for Microsoft Windows 10  and Mac OS 10.11 was released in FY 2017; updates  for SCAP 1.3 will be released in FY 2018.  Vendors continued to beneft from the openly  available SCAP validation test suite reference  material. Access to the validation test suite enables  vendors to test products during development and  provides a means for verifying SCAP conformance  after operational products are patched. Through the  use of the reference materials, vendors that market  their products to federal agencies may better  prepare for formal validation testing with NVLAP  accredited laboratories. Vendors focused on the 73  https://scap.nist.gov/validation https://scap.nist.gov/validation  ITL CYBERSECURITY PROGRAM AND PROJECTS  |  FY 2017  critical infrastructure, and for which formal validation  testing may not be required, have access to reference  material that ensures that scanning products are  correctly processing SCAP content. Approximately  86 % of confguration scanning products are SCAP- validated, and SCAP product vendors continue to  engage with the SCAP Validation Program on new  releases of the validation test content. The current list  of SCAP 1.2-validated products may be found on the  SCAP Validated Products list at https://nvd.nist.gov/  scap/validated-tools.  In FY 2018, NISTIR 7511 for SCAP 1.3 and the  associated validation test suite reference material will  be released. In addition, the program will continue to  add support for new platforms (i.e., Windows Server  2016 and Mac OS 10.12). The program will continue  to collaborate with vendors, laboratories, and the  Security Automation team on updating validation  resources in a meaningful way that meets the needs  of federal agencies and the critical infrastructure.  Coordination with the Security Automation team  ensures that validation resources are developed and  released in conjunction with new releases of SCAP.

IDENTITY AND ACCESS  MANAGEMENT  NIST Personal Identity Verifcation  Program (NPIVP)  The objective of the NIST Personal Identity  Verifcation Program (NPIVP) is to validate Personal  Identity Verifcation (PIV) products for conformance  to the specifcations in FIPS 201, Personal Identity  Verifcation (PIV) of Federal Employees and  Contractors. There are three companion technical  documents:  1. SP 800-73, Interfaces for Personal Identity  Verifcation;  2. SP 800-76, Biometric Specifcations for  Personal Identity Verifcation; and  3. SP 800-78, Cryptographic Algorithms and Key  Sizes for Personal Identity Verifcation.  The two main products are: the PIV Card  Application and the PIV Middleware. The guidelines for  performing the conformance tests for these products  are themselves outlined in two technical documents  (SP 800-85A, PIV Card Application and Middleware  Interface Test Guidelines (SP 800-73-4 Compliance),  and SP 800-85B, PIV Data Model Test Guidelines);  they specify a two-step process that frst involves  the development of Derived Test Requirements  (DTRs) and then the actual test procedures. To  implement these tests and to generate conformance  test reports, CSD also developed test modules for  testing the PIV card application and PIV middleware.  These modules were provided to NPIVP test facilities  for testing and certifying the vendor submissions in  the two PIV product categories. NPIVP test facilities  are Cryptographic and Security Testing (CST)  Laboratories that were accredited by the NVLAP.  NPIVP also assisted NVLAP in the accreditation  of laboratories by developing technology-focused  assessment criteria. An additional software module to  perform conformance testing for the PIV data model  was also developed by CSD to enable GSA to provide  a toolkit to agencies for testing fully personalized PIV  cards prior to card issuance.  FIPS 201 specifes the architecture and technical  requirements for the PIV cards. Since the start of the  NPIVP, FIPS 201 has undergone two revisions and the  companion technical documents even more revisions.  The two test guidelines documents have also been  updated to be consistent with the specifcation  documents. The NPIVP team was fully involved in the  review, analysis and development of these revisions  of specifcation documents and have also ensured  that these revisions are fully refected in the two test  guidelines documents as well as in the test software  modules. The latest versions of all documents (as of  September 2017) with their URLs, as well as the URL 74  https://nvd.nist.gov/scap/validated-tools https://nvd.nist.gov/scap/validated-tools https://scap.nist.gov/validation/ mailto:michael.cooper@nist.gov  NIST/ITL CYBERSECURITY PROGRAM ANNUAL REPORT 2017  for the list of accredited NPIVP labs are given below:  Specifcation Documents:  • FIPS 201-2, Personal Identity Verifcation (PIV)  of Federal Employees and Contractors – (see  https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/FIPS/NIST.

During FY 2017, NPIVP did a major redesign of the  test software modules. The three software modules  for PIV card application conformance testing, PIV  Middleware conformance testing and PIV data model  conformance testing were all integrated into a single  comprehensive toolkit to eliminate redundancies  and inconsistencies in software codes performing  the same functionality and to make the maintenance  of the overall toolkit much easier. Further tests  pertaining to diferent card interfaces (Contact,  Contactless, Secure Messaging and Virtual Contact)  for the same command were grouped together for  easy accessibility. The redesigned test toolkit (now  called the SP 800-73-4 PIV Test Runner for PIV  Card Applications, Middleware and Data Model) has  been made freely available to the public and can be  downloaded at https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/NIST- Personal-Identity-Verifcation-Program/Software- Downloads.  NPIVP’s PIV Card Application Validation List  is available at https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/NIST- Personal-Identity-Verifcation-Program/Validation- Lists/PIV-Card-Application-Validation-List.  The PIV Middleware Validation List is available at  https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/NIST-Personal-Identity- Verifcation-Program/Validation-Lists/SP-800-73-4- PIV-Middleware-Validation-List.  During FY 2017, fve PIV card application products  were certifed and validated.

FIPS  201 was approved by the Secretary of Commerce in  February 2005. HSPD-12 called for the creation of a  new identity credential for federal employees and  contractors. FIPS 201 is the technical specifcation for  both the PIV identity credential and the PIV system  that produces, manages, and uses the credential.  Within NIST’s ITL, this work is a collaborative efort of  the CSD and the IAD. CSD activities in FY 2017 directly  supported the latest revision of FIPS 201 (i.e., FIPS 201- 2) by updating the relevant publications associated  with FIPS 201-2 and by initiating implementations  of the credential on mobile devices. CSD performed  the following activities during FY 2017 in support of  HSPD-12:  • Coordinated with the revision team in the  ACD to update SP 800-63, titled The Digital  Identity Guidelines, and ensured close  alignment with the PIV Standard in areas of  enrollment, identity proofng, authentication  and credential lifecycle management.  • With industry CRADA partners, built sample  solutions at the NCCoE to demonstrate the  issuance and use of PIV Credentials on mobile  devices using commercial technologies. For  more information visit https://nccoe.nist.gov/  projects/building-blocks/piv-credentials.  • Coordinated cybersecurity-related updates  with vendors, departments and agencies to  ease migration to stronger cryptography for  identity credentials and for a PIV system that  produces, manages, and uses the credential  -- to include the sunset of the Triple Data  Encryption Algorithm (TDEA), the upgrade  to Deterministic Random Number Generator  (DRBG).  In FY 2018, CSD will continue to focus on updating  the relevant publications associated with FIPS 201-2,  including fnalizing SP 800-116 Revision 1. CSD will also  continue to provide technical and strategic inputs to  the PIV-related initiatives.

In FY 2018, CSD will continue the above research.  CSD expects that this project will:  • Promote (or accelerate) the adoption of  community computing that utilizes the power  of shared resources and common trust- management schemes;  • Provide guidance for implementing AC  models and mechanisms for standalone or  network systems;  • Increase the security and safety of static  (connected) distributed systems by applying  the testing and verifcation tool for the AC  policies;  • Assist system architects, security  administrators, and security managers whose  expertise is related to AC or privilege policy  in managing their systems and in learning the  limitations and practical approaches for their  applications; and  • Provide accurate and efcient fault detection  and correction technology for implementing  AC rules and policies.

Faulty  policies, misconfgurations, or faws in software  implementation can result in serious vulnerabilities.  The specifcation of AC policies is often a challenging  problem. Often, a system’s privacy and security  are compromised due to the  misconfguration of  AC policies, instead of the failure of cryptographic  primitives or protocols. This problem becomes  increasingly severe as software systems become  more and more complex, and are deployed to  manage a large amount of sensitive information  and resources that are organized into sophisticated  structures. Identifying discrepancies between policy  specifcations and their intended properties is crucial  because the correct implementation and enforcement  of policies by applications is based on the premise that  the policy specifcations are correct. As a result, policy  specifcations must undergo rigorous verifcation and  validation through systematic testing to ensure that  the policy specifcations truly encapsulate the desires  of the policy authors.  To formally and precisely capture the security  properties that AC should adhere to, access control  models are usually written to bridge the rather wide  gap in abstraction between policy and mechanism.  Thus, an AC model provides unambiguous and precise  expression as well as a reference for the design and  implementation of security requirements. Techniques  are required for verifying whether an AC model is  correctly expressed in the AC policies, and whether  the properties are satisfed in the model.  Most research on AC model or policy verifcation  techniques is focused on one particular model, and  almost all of the research is in applied methods, which  require the completed AC policies as the input for  the verifcation or test processes to generate fault  reports. Even though correct verifcation is achieved,  and counter-examples may be generated when faults  are found, those methods provide no information  about the source of faults that might allow conficts  in privilege assignment, the leakage of privileges, or  a confict-of-interest in permissions. The difculty in  fnding the source of faults is increased, especially  when the AC rules are intricately covering duplicated  variables to a degree of complexity. The complexity is  because a fault might not be caused by one particular  access rule but by multiple rules that confict. Thus, it  requires manually analyzing each rule in the policy to  fnd the correct solution for correcting the fault.  To address the issue, CSD developed the ACPT,  shown in Figure 29, which allows a user to compose,  verify, test, and generate access control policies. CSD  also researched the AC Rule Logic Circuit Simulation  (ACRLCS) technique, which enables the AC authors to  detect a fault when the fault-causing AC rule is added  to the policy, so the fx can be implemented in real  time before adding other rules that further complicate  the detecting efort, rather than checking by retracing  the interrelations between rules after the policy is  completed.  In FY 2017, CSD accomplished the following:  • Published SP 800-192, Verifcation and Test  Methods for Access Control Policies/Models,  an article, Access Control Policy Verifcation  in IEEE Computer, and a conference paper,  Diferentiation Non-Isomorphic Graphs for  Graph Analytics;  • Enhanced the capability of ACPT by including  additional functions for the specifcations  of subject inheritance, separation of duty  requirements, and better user interfaces for  policy model specifcation;  • Enhanced the usability and fxed bugs of the  ACRLCS (the Access Control Rule Logic Circuit  Simulation System) to provide more policy  composing and user interface capability for  policy fault detection;  • Supported two Small Business Innovation  Research (SBIR) Phase II projects for the  access control tool and embeded function  developments; and  78  mailto:vhu@nist.gov mailto:david.ferraiolo@nist.gov mailto:kuhn@nist.gov  NIST/ITL CYBERSECURITY PROGRAM ANNUAL REPORT 2017  Templates indude .­ ABAC , World/ow, and  Multi-Level  Validates models  against properties  Access Control Policy Tool  GU/allows  specificatfon of users,  user attributes ,  actions, resources ,  resources attributes,  and properties .-----------------+-------......... ----.

For example, access to a  database could be restricted to users with particular  attributes, such as membership in a group (e.g.,  employees) and other conditions (e.g., part of the  Human Resource Department). ABAC represents a  point on the spectrum of logical access control, from  simple access control lists to more capable Role Based  Access Control (RBAC), and fnally, to a highly fexible  method for providing access based on the evaluation  of attributes.  CSD is conducting research that provides  information for using ABAC to improve information  sharing within and among organizations based on the  planning, design, implementation, and operational  considerations. The research also includes technologies  such as attribute assurance, attribute engineering/  management, identity system integration, attribute  federation, situational awareness (real-time or  contextual) mechanisms, policy management, and  natural-language policy translation to digital policy.  Figure 31 illustrates the interaction of many of these  components.  The goal of this research is to improve information  sharing, while maintaining control of that information  for federal agencies.  In FY 2017, the project team:  • Published the book Attribute-Based Access  Control by Artech House. The book contains  discussions covering almost all aspects of  ABAC;  • Published a conference paper: Verifcation of  Resilience Policies that Assist Attribute Based  Access Control. The paper presents research  results of access privilege blocking and  privilege leaking; and  • Worked with government, industry and  academic organizations in exploring diverse  models (e.g., Next Generation Access Control  - NGAC) and applications (e.g., distributed  systems: Cloud, Bigdata, IoT applications) of  ABAC.  80  https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/access-control-policy-tool https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/access-control-policy-tool mailto:vhu@nist.gov mailto:kuhn@nist.gov  NIST/ITL CYBERSECURITY PROGRAM ANNUAL REPORT 2017  ~ Ent erpri se  Enterpri se Access Control  Policy Repositor y  .... v~ olicy Manager ~ Local Access Control  , Policy Repository , , ~------ I ,, ,  ~ ~,,' Enterpri se Access Contro l  Policy Admin istration Point  Enterpri se Identit y/  Credential Manager  Subject  Att ribute Issuance  Enterpri se Subject  Attri bute  Administ ration Point  \\  \\  \\  \\  \\  \\  \\  \\  \\  \\  \\  \\  ~  Optional Enterpri se  Policy Decision Service  Credenital lnssuance  Subject  ' '  Enterpri se Subject  Attribute Shar ing  ,. , ,7 Local Subject  ' Attribute  Local Subject Attribute  Adm inist ration Point  Repository  Hierarchical Policy  Pushed to Subordinate  <- _ _ Organizations --------  Environment  Conditions  -----+  --- ~------- 1  I  Local Access Control Policy 1  Admini stration Point  Object  A Optiona l Enterpri se  ABAC\"  : Obj ect Attr ibute Bindin g 1  VI and Validation Service  ii ~  Access  Control  Mechanism  Set of Availab le  Attribute s for Policy  Development  I  I,:.,,~ ~  Object '{\",,,  Attribute  Repository  Enterpri se Object  Attribute M anager  Local Obj ect Attribute  Administration Point I __________________________________ J  Figure 31: ABAC Access Control Mechanism Chart  In FY 2018, CSD will continue the research of ABAC  formal models, as well as the details and extended  topics of ABAC capabilities, such as attribute  considerations, ABAC implementation examples,  ABAC mechanisms, and ABAC standards. The ABAC  project will pursue the following objectives:  • Provide readers with an overview of the  current state of logical access control,  a working defnition of ABAC, and an  explanation of the core and enterprise ABAC  concepts;  • Assist security policy makers in establishing a  business case for ABAC implementation and  acquiring an interoperable set of capabilities;  • Assist ABAC developers in developing  the operational requirements and overall  enterprise architecture;  • Assist ABAC administrators in establishing or  refning business processes to support ABAC;  • Promote the adoption of ABAC for a more  secure and fexible method for information  sharing in a standalone or enterprise  environment; and  • Provide testing methods for ABAC policy and  implementations.

ACD is committed  to advancing measurement science, technology, and  standards adoption to improve digital identity for  individuals and organizations alike.  In FY 2017, the Trusted Identities Program was a  key participant and driving force in the digital identity  arena for NIST’s National Cybersecurity Center of  Excellence (NCCoE). Many identity-related projects  initiated at the NCCoE leveraged the technical  expertise and experiences of, and the foundational  guidelines and practices issued by, ACD and NIST’s  broader identity program.  Through these collaborative eforts, projects  this year focused on driving the adoption of trusted  identities through digital identity standards, including  for federal agencies. NIST also engaged the community  on standards and guidelines development, including  issuing SP 800-63-3, Digital Identity Guidelines,  collaborating with other countries to advance high- assurance online identity standards, and participating  in the OpenID Foundation and Fast Identity Online  (FIDO) Alliance.  ACD  also focused on building trust in digital  identity technologies by advancing measurement  science in the identity space—which included  measuring the strength of authenticators and  evaluating attribute metadata. The team also  continued work with numerous external partners  through trusted identities pilots, seeding the market  with innovative technologies and providing solutions.  Updated Digital Identity Guidelines  In June of 2017, ACD  fnalized the latest revision  to SP 800-63-3, which covers digital identity from  initial risk assessment to deployment of federated  identity solutions. Digital identity in both agencies  and the market place have changed dramatically  since the publication’s last revision in 2013; the latest  update was designed to give agencies more options  and to align with international standards. One of  the most signifcant updates is replacing levels of  assurance with three individual components of the  digital identity fow for more fexibility in design and  operations: the identity, authenticator, and federation  assurance levels. Identity proofng was also updated  to further mitigate the potential for mass breaches of  personal information.  Over the course of a year, the document evolved  with the help of the community. For this revision,  GitHub was used to interact in near-real-time with  the community and received a tremendous response:  over 1,400 comments were submitted, and the web  version of the publication drew over 74,000 unique  visitors between May 2016 and May 2017. ACD will  continue to use this approach in the future during the  development of new volumes and document revisions.  International Standards Alignment  ACD, the United Kingdom Cabinet Ofce, and the  Canada Treasury Board have been collaborating to  compare national frameworks for identity assurance  with the intention of creating a broad and competitive  global market for identity solutions and enabling  cross-border credential interoperability. Building on  recent updates to guidance documents like NIST’s  SP 800-63-3 and the UK’s Good Practice Guides,  the group made several recommendations for the  International  Organization for Standardization’s  (ISO’s) suite of identity standards. These  recommendations included the development of a new  standard that provides an overall approach to identity  and authentication risk management and assurance;  organizations could leverage this when developing  their models for assessing and managing identity- based risks and threats.  The group also recommended refocusing ISO/IEC  29115, Entity Authentication Assurance Framework, to  address authentication threats and risks exclusively.  These updates should contain a threat model, controls  and mitigations, and guidance on how these can  be combined to achieve defned risk management  outcomes for authentication events.  NIST staf members served as the Federal  Government lead for all activities in the (Fast IDentity  Online) FIDO Alliance, which focuses on creating 82  https://www.nist.gov/itl/tig  NIST/ITL CYBERSECURITY PROGRAM ANNUAL REPORT 2017  strong authentication specifcations to create an  identity ecosystem. During 2017, ACD participation  included active membership and contribution in  technical and privacy working groups, as well as  international plenary participation in Hong Kong,  Vancouver, Madrid, and Sydney.  Additionally, ACD supported standardization  eforts including iGov (see https://openid.net/wg/  igov). The iGov is working toward an OpenID Connect  specifcation that will enable users to authenticate and  share consented attribute information with public- sector services across the globe. The resulting profle  will enable standardized integration with public-sector  relying parties (RPs) in multiple jurisdictions.  Authenticator Strength of Function  NIST is working to produce a framework  for evaluating and comparing the strength of  authentication solutions, starting with the Strength of  Function for Authenticators – Biometrics (SOFA-B).  The team began with a focus on biometrics, due to  the increased availability of biometric solutions in the  consumer space and the need for improved security  guidance regarding the use of those solutions as  authenticators. The end goal is a framework to  assess and combine authentication technologies, as  well as to compare biometrics’ efectiveness to that  of passwords and other authenticators. Using the  SOFA-B framework, RPs will be able to determine  the overall strength of biometric authentication,  considering matching performance, presentation  attack detection, and the efort required to break – or  spoof – a system.  With the draft of NISTIR 8112: A Proposed Schema  for Evaluating Federated Attributes, the TIG aims to  give RPs greater insight into how attributes assist  with risk-based business decision-making. RPs can  examine this metadata and determine if they have  the confdence they need in the attribute value before  making an authorization decision. This NISTIR is being  treated like  an implementers’ draft, an approach  focused on real-world implementation results and  lessons learned before fnalizing the document. ACD  plans to advance SOFA-B and attribute metadata  eforts to their next stages in FY 2018.  Innovative Digital Identity Solutions  ACD has advanced  trusted digital identity  solutions by building partnerships that stem from  the trusted identities pilots. These pilots develop  and deploy technology, models, and frameworks  that would not otherwise  exist in the marketplace,  and have impacted more than 8.8 million individuals  to date. In FY 2017, the pilots made remarkable  progress: the 24 projects now involve more than 190  partner organizations across 12 sectors — including  the development or deployment of 16 multi-factor  authentication solutions.  In FY 2018, NIST, through the NCCoE, will fully  integrate identity management standards, best  practices, and technical approaches into projects that  are foundational to the work of the NCCoE and many  of its stakeholders and projects, including the Internet  of Things. The project will also continue to advance  the digital identity marketplace by collaborating with  partners on measurement science, technology, and  standards adoption, and develop guidance to meet  today’s digital identity needs.

CSD tracks software  security vulnerabilities (in the National Vulnerability  Database), and seeks techniques for the measurement  of security vulnerabilities and techniques that reduce  the impact and prevalence of security vulnerabilities  in newly developed products or in new versions of  existing products.  One approach to reducing the number of  security vulnerabilities in software is to improve the  development tools that are available. By identifying  languages and software development tools that  support a reduction of vulnerabilities, and by  stimulating the creation of better tools and tool  usage techniques, the approach has the potential  to help developers produce applications with fewer  vulnerabilities. While it is impossible to assure the  total absence of security vulnerabilities in this way, it  might well be possible to rule out specifc, signifcant  classes of vulnerabilities that currently provide the  basis for many serious exploits.  CSD is developing an empirical, competitive  approach to fnding the most efective and usable  combinations of tools to produce software systems  that are relatively free of exploitable vulnerabilities.  Multiple competitions are planned that will be based  on an idea developed during the Designing a Secure  Systems Engineering Competition Workshop that was  conducted by the National Science Foundation in  2010. The workshop proposed a competition for the  development of a set of tools to help non-security- expert developers to rapidly build a signifcant  application with zero vulnerabilities, as detected by  an extensive public test suite.  The participants in the planned competitions  will implement software systems to solve challenge  problems using software development tool chains  (“toolchains”) of their own choosing, within specifed  time periods. The toolchains will be free to include  existing technologies (e.g., existing software libraries  and frameworks, code generators, reusable source  code, or bug-fnding tools), novel technologies, or  any combination thereof. Each competition will apply  time pressure by simulating a deadline in the software  development process, increasing the likelihood of  an introduction of security faws. The objective of  the toolchains will be to detect or prevent security  faws while still supporting the quick-paced software  development of applications with rich feature  sets. Through the demonstration of security-faw  avoidance in a time-constrained setting, CSD will seek  to show that wide-scale improvements in the overall  security of software products can be realized without  sacrifcing a time-to-market goal. The competitions,  which will be open to all interested parties, will aim  to provide consistent application and measurement  of commercial and research software development,  composition, and reuse techniques.  In FY 2017, CSD personnel documented the  Toolchain Infrastructure (TCI) in a collection of  documents that included a concept of operations,  system design specifcation, and administrator’s  and users guides. These documents helped inform  the development of a python-based prototype of  the TCI. The prototype development efort included  automated unit test scripts for the TCI and the  confguration and deployment of the TCI hardware.  The team also refned a selected challenge problem  by updating the problem descriptions, requirements,  and test cases; and developed an exemplar challenge  problem solution in python.  In FY 2018, CSD plans to complete the  development and testing of the TCI prototype. The  team will enhance the prototype to further improve  its reliability and reproducibility, perform extensive  testing of the TCI, and publicly announce the frst  toolchain competition.  CONTACTS:  Mr. Lee Badger Mr. Christopher Johnson  (301) 975-3176 (301) 975-3247  lee.badger@nist.gov christopher.johnson@nist.gov  Networks of Things  The Internet of Things (IoT) increasingly  appears  to be the next great technology revolution. It is  expected to impact everything from healthcare  delivery, to how food is produced, to how we work, to  all forms of transportation and communication, and  to virtually all forms of automation. IoT will impact  everyone, and in multiple ways.  With a technology revolution of such large impact  on society, it is imperative that IoT-based systems  can be trusted. This means that they should exhibit  secure, reliable, and private behaviors as well as many 84  mailto:lee.badger@nist.gov mailto:christopher.johnson@nist.gov  NIST/ITL CYBERSECURITY PROGRAM ANNUAL REPORT 2017  other attributes associated with quality. Privacy is  particularly important because IoT-based systems  will likely produce huge amounts of data as a result  of sensing and surveillance. This is the “big data”  challenge associated with IoT. Therefore, techniques,  tools, and methods to mitigate the numerous “trust”  challenges are needed before these automated IoT- based networks manage much of daily life.  In July 2016, NIST released SP 800-183, Networks  of ‘Things’, which addressed the question: “What is the  science, if any, underlying IoT?” After releasing that  document, NIST has begun to look at how to apply  the principles in the document in a practical setting,  with a focus on healthcare. NIST has also looked at  the security and privacy of virtual assistants, and how  a network of things with low inherent testability can  be tested.  Future work in this area will refne the defnitions  of the fve core networks of things building blocks  as presented in SP 800-183. For example, instead of  considering all temperature sensors as equal, NIST will  create categories of sensors for various applications  and vertical domains. Furthermore, a small IoT lab  to test “low-energy” devices is being architected.  In addition, NIST plans to present these results in  Revision 1 of SP 800-183, which are expected to be  produced in by the end of 2018.

During his talk, Intermediaries in Cloud- Computing, which was presented at the Institute for  Operations Research and the Management Sciences  (INFORMS) meeting in Dallas, Texas, he referred to  a cloud as an important new “computing paradigm  where the boundaries of computing will be determined  by economic rationale rather than technical limits  alone.” The international IT literature and media later  provided many defnitions, models, and architectures,  but it was not until 2011, when NIST published SP 800- 145, The NIST Defnition of Cloud Computing, that the  world coalesced on the cloud deployment and service  models, defnitions and descriptions provided in SP  800-145.  Following the December 2010 Federal  Government’s “Cloud First” policy issued as part of  the 25-point plan for the U.S. Federal Government’s  (USG) IT modernization and reform, NIST assumed  a technical leadership role for the federal agencies’  eforts related to the adoption and development of  cloud computing standards. The goal was to accelerate  the Federal Government’s adoption of secure and  efective cloud computing solutions to reduce costs  and improve services.  In addition to the initial defnition of cloud  computing, NIST built a USG cloud computing  technology roadmap that focused on security,  interoperability, and portability requirements, and  lead eforts to develop standards and guidelines in  close collaboration with standards bodies, the private  sector, and other stakeholders. NIST also developed  a cloud computing reference architecture, a security  reference architecture and, during 2017, focused on  developing the guidance for applying a risk-based  approach to cloud adoption and the guidance for  leveraging the NIST Cybersecurity Framework in the  process of architecting a cloud-based system secured  with SP 800-53 Revision 4 security and privacy  controls.  During FY 2017, NIST also researched the security  challenges encountered when leveraging application  containers and microservices for the implementation  of cloud-based federal information systems, along  with the impact on the system’s security posture.  Details regarding the latest projects are provided  below.  85  https://dx.doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-183 https://www.nist.gov/topics/internet-things-iot mailto:jeff.voas@nist.gov  ITL CYBERSECURITY PROGRAM AND PROJECTS  |  FY 2017  NIST is also leading the research and development CSD Role in the NIST Cloud  of the projects listed below: Computing Program  During FY 2017, NIST continued to promote the  development of publications, national and international  standards, and specifcations in support of the USG’s  efective and secure use of cloud computing, as well  as providing technical guidance to federal agencies  for secure and efective cloud-computing adoption.  During FY 2017, NIST’s cloud computing security and  forensic science activities included the development  of the following guidance and/or recommendations:  • NIST Draft SP 800-173, Guide for Applying the  Risk Management Framework to Cloud-based  Federal Information Systems. This publication  initially focused on providing guidance in  using the Risk Management Framework  described in SP 800-37 Revision 1, Guide for  Applying the Risk Management Framework to  Federal Information Systems: a Security Life  Cycle Approach, to issue an authorization to  operate for cloud-based information systems.  As SP 800-37 underwent revision in late FY  2017, and is anticipated to be fnalized in  early FY 2018, the draft of SP 800-173 will be  updated to refect all changes incorporated  in the SP 800-37 Rev. 2 and will be posted for  public comment after publication of SP 800- 37 Rev. 2.  • NIST Draft SP 800-174, Security and  Privacy Controls for Cloud-based Federal  Information Systems. This document provides  a methodology that leverages the NIST  Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) to architect  a cloud-based information system and to  identify security controls deemed necessary  to implement in order to secure the system.  The document will be available for public  comment in the frst quarter of FY 2018. The  document will be accompanied by a tool,  Cloud Security Architecture Tool (CSAT), that  implements the methodology described in SP  800-174 and allows users to customize their  data and tailor their security controls. The tool  repository is available at: https://github.com/  usnistgov/CloudSecurityArchitectureTool.  • Members of the NIST Cloud Security Working  Group, in collaboration with the Cloud Security  Alliance’s members, researched the security  challenges encountered when leveraging  application containers and microservices  for the implementation of cloud-based  information systems. Based on this research,  ITL will publish (in early FY 2018) the NIST  Interagency Report (NISTIR) documenting the  fndings and will provide recommendations  based on the best practices for mitigating the  identifed challenges.  • Members of the NIST Cloud Security Working  Group are researching the security challenges  encountered when implementing cloud-based  federated identity solutions and the impact  on the overall system’s security posture.  Based on this research, NIST will issue an  interagency report documenting the fndings  and will provide recommendations based on  the best practices for mitigating the identifed  challenges.  • Members of the NIST Cloud Forensic Science  Working Group are working on defning  a cloud forensics reference architecture  that leverages SP 500-299: Cloud Security  Reference Architecture and NISTIR 8006,  NIST Cloud Computing Forensic Science  Challenges. In support of U.S. cloud- computing mandates, CSD staf members  provide leadership for several public cloud  working groups operating under the NIST  Cloud Computing Program. These working  groups focus on meeting the high-priority  requirements described in SP 500-293, U.S.  Government Cloud Computing Technology  Roadmap.  CSD staf co-chaired several signifcant cloud  computing eforts in 2017:  • Co-Chaired the NIST Cloud Computing  Security Working Group and led the working  group on the development of the NIST  research on Application Containers and  Microservices – security challenges and 86  https://github.com/usnistgov/CloudSecurityArchitectureTool https://github.com/usnistgov/CloudSecurityArchitectureTool  NIST/ITL CYBERSECURITY PROGRAM ANNUAL REPORT 2017  best practices. The result of this efort will  materialize in FY 2018 into the development of  a NIST Interagency Report and a NIST Special  Publication.  • Co-Chaired the NIST Cloud Computing  Forensic Science Working Group and led the  development of SP 800-201, Cloud Forensics  Reference Architecture, which is currently in  progress.  • Co-Chaired the NIST Cloud Computing  Interoperability and Portability Working  Group and addressed issues facing cloud  computing with respect to interoperability  and portability, standards, and common and  functional terminologies. CSD staf members  participated in various standards development  organizations, all listed in the section of this  report dedicated to international standards.  In FY 2018, NIST will continue collaboration  with the private sector, academia and other  public-sector entities on developing guidance  and specifcations that support the broad  adoption of innovative cloud solutions. Some  of the very efective frameworks for such  collaborations that NIST is hosting are the  public working groups, with international  participation.

This exponential increase is fueled  by the proliferation of mobile devices (e.g., mobile  phones and tablets), smart sensors serving diferent  vertical markets (e.g., smart power grids, autonomous  transportation, industrial controls, smart cities,  wearables, etc), wireless sensors and actuators  networks. New concepts and technologies are needed  to manage this growing feet of Internet of Things  (IoT) devices in a manner that ensures minimal latency  across a distributed and decentralized model.  Researchers working with system and network  engineers are continually developing innovative  solutions to fll the technological gaps. Many of these  solutions or computational paradigms have begun  to be referred to as fog computing, mist computing,  cloudlets, or edge computing. Lacking broad  consensus on the distinction among these concepts,  NIST facilitated an efort to better defne these topics  to help facilitate meaningful conversations among  practitioners and researchers.  During FY 2017, NIST collaborated with the IoT  community to develop SP 500-325, Fog Computing  Conceptual Model. This publication provides the  conceptual model of fog computing and its subsidiary  concept, mist computing, and identifes these  concepts in relation to cloud computing, cloudlets,  and edge computing.  The fog computing research will continue in FY  2018 with the development of the draft of SP 800- 199, Security and Privacy Controls for Fog-based  Information Systems. This document, also referred to  as the fog computing overlay, will identify the security  and privacy controls specifc to fog computing  ecosystems, allowing users of this computational  model to build resilient and survivable standalone  fog computing environments that are more resistant  to penetration attacks and are capable of limiting the  damage from attacks when they occur.

To this end, the  Program hosted the IoT Cybersecurity Colloquium  in Gaithersburg to better understand the overall  threat landscape from the point of view of the  community (see https://www.nist.gov/news-events/  events/2017/10/iot-cybersecurity-colloquium). The  presenters discussed specifc security and privacy risks  and NIST’s role in supporting these areas. The team  is currently drafting a NISTIR on the presentations,  themes, and community feedback.  Additionally, NIST and DHS co-chair the IoT Task  Group of the Interagency International Cybersecurity  Standardization Working Group (IICS WG). The  IICS WG established the Task Group to determine  the present state of international IoT cybersecurity  standards. The Task Group has 54 federal employee  participants representing 13 agencies and will  convene in early FY 2018 to determine the next steps  for its draft report. If approved, NIST is prepared to  take this document through the NISTIR process in FY  2018 to collect industry input on specifc areas, such  as market adoption and challenges associated with  the adoption of existing standards.  In FY 2018, the Cybersecurity for IoT Program  will continue collaborating with stakeholders as NIST  begins drafting guidance for IoT security and privacy.  As part of the drafting process, the team will hold  town-hall meetings for input on discussion drafts. The  document is intended to educate federal agencies  on common high-level security and privacy risks  for IoT, and to introduce practical risk management  considerations for IoT product selection, deployment,  protection, and operation.  Additional information regarding the broad  portfolio of NIST activities for supporting secure IoT  can be found on our program website.

The Policy Machine (PM) is a fundamental  reworking of traditional access control into a form  suited to the needs of a modern, distributed,  interconnected enterprise. The PM is based on a  fexible infrastructure that can provide access control  services for several diferent types of resources that  are accessed by diferent types of applications and  users. The PM infrastructure is scalable and can  support policies of various types simultaneously  while remaining manageable in the face of changing  technology, organizational restructuring, and  increasing amounts of data. The PM provides a  framework capable of supporting combinations of  both current access control approaches and newly  conceived types of policy without extensions.  NIST and other members of an Ad Hoc INCITS  working group are continuing to develop a three-part  NGAC standard. This work is being conducted under  three sub-projects:  • Project 2193–D: Next Generation Access  Control – Implementation Requirements,  Protocols and API Defnitions;  • Project 2194–D: Next Generation Access  Control – Functional Architecture; and  • Project 2195–D: Next Generation Access  Control – Generic Operations and Abstract  Data Structures. 88  https://www.nist.gov/news-events/events/2017/10/iot-cybersecurity-colloquium https://www.nist.gov/news-events/events/2017/10/iot-cybersecurity-colloquium https://www.nist.gov/programs-projects/nist-cybersecurity-iot-program https://www.nist.gov/programs-projects/nist-cybersecurity-iot-program mailto:Katerina.megas@nist.gov mailto:Benjamin.piccarreta@nist.gov  NIST/ITL CYBERSECURITY PROGRAM ANNUAL REPORT 2017  An initial standard from this work was published  in 2013 and is now available from ANSI as INCITS  499: NGAC Functional Architecture (NGAC-FA) (see  http://www.techstreet.com/standards/incits/499_  draft?product_id=1827386). However, based on  experience with similar eforts (e.g., Project 2193-D,  Project 2195-D, and the revised NISTIR 7987, Policy  Machine: Features, Architecture, and Specifcation).  This standard has been updated and was in the  process of formal publication at the end of FY 2017.  In addition, as of the end of FY 2017, the work on  Project 2193-D had been submitted to ANSI as INCITS  525: NGAC Implementation Requirements, Protocols  and API Defnitions (NGAC-IRPADS), for approval for  an initial public review.  The standard for Project 2195-D has been approved  and is now available from the ANSI e-standards store  as INCITS 526: NGAC Generic Operations and Abstract  Data Structures (NGAC-GOADS).  The eXtensible Access Control Markup  Language (XACML) and NGAC are very diferent  ABAC standards with similar goals and objectives.  What are the similarities and diferences between  these two standards?  What are  their comparative  advantages and disadvantages? To answer these  questions, in October 2016 NIST published SP 800- 178, A Comparison of Attribute Based Access Control  (ABAC) Standards for Data Service Applications:  Extensible Access Control Markup Language (XACML)  and Next Generation Access Control (NGAC),  to describe and compare these standards with  respect to the criteria derived from ABAC issues or  considerations identifed by SP 800-162, Guide to  Attribute Based Access Control (ABAC) Defnition  and Considerations: operational efciency, attribute  and policy management, scope and type of policy  support, and support for administrative review and  resource discovery.  In FY 2017, CSD issued the frst version of the  Policy Machine Web Services through GitHub as  an open-source distribution to support widespread  experimentation of web-based applications. The  current version of the web services supports most  NGAC functionality. In order to provide an example  of web-based clients, CSD is planning to issue an  administrative interface for policy management,  which will also include a user interface with PIV  authentication (if feasible) and some sample  applications (e.g., email, fle management, records  management, document editor, workfow, etc.).  In FY 2018, CSD will continue improving the Web  services version of the Policy Machine to include  the remaining NGAC functionalities and more  applications to provide diferent use cases to support  the community’s use of the Policy Machine.

An IT infrastructure can be  looked upon as having fve components or resources:  Hardware, Operating System (OS), and Applications  that collectively form a compute node, together with  network and storage components that provide the  function of interconnecting the computing nodes  and supporting a persistent medium for storing  data respectively. Any of these fve resources can be  virtualized by building an abstraction layer on top of  it, facilitating efcient utilization of that resource by  other components or resources as well as providing a  degree of isolation among the utilizing components.  The earliest component to be virtualized was  the hardware (ubiquitously referred to as Server  Virtualization) through an abstraction layer (software  module) called the Hypervisor. This gave rise to  an architecture where multiple computing stacks  (called Virtual Machines or VMs) each with a diferent  OS can be run on a single physical host (called a  virtualized host). To connect the various VMs residing  in a single physical host, an approach to networking  (called the Virtual Network) had to be implemented.  The Virtual Network used the software analogs of  89  http://www.techstreet.com/standards/incits/499_draft?product_id=1827386 http://www.techstreet.com/standards/incits/499_draft?product_id=1827386 mailto:david.ferraiolo@nist.gov  mailto:gopi.katwala@nist.gov https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/policy-machine  ITL CYBERSECURITY PROGRAM AND PROJECTS  |  FY 2017  Application Scheduling  Container Scheduling  Service Discovery  Container Cluster Management  Container Networking  .g;;;,;;;  Container Runtime  Container OS  Physical Host (or VM)  Container Runtime  Container OS  Physical Host (or VM)  DevOps Tools  hardware network devices such as network interface  cards (NICs) and switches. Thus, the Virtual Network  (which was later extended to connect virtualized  hosts themselves in addition to VMs inside a single  virtualized host) became an integral part of the server  virtualization infrastructure. From FY 2014 to FY 2016,  this project focused on providing guidelines for the  secure confguration and deployment of hypervisors  and virtual networks.  The next component to be virtualized was the OS  itself. The application component of the computing  stack was packaged into multiple self-contained  lightweight software elements called Application  Containers. The abstraction of the OS itself was  enabled by a software module called “Container  Runtime”. This form of virtualization brought in  several new technology components involved in  building containers, storing them in repositories  (called registries) and deploying and managing them  (through a process called orchestration) as logical  groups (called clusters). The resulting computing  stack with all these new components is shown in  Figure 32 as the Container Technology stack.  With the increasing adoption of application  container technology for deploying, managing and  maintaining applications, NIST identifed threats to  components involved in supporting containers as well  as the security countermeasures to mitigate the efect  of those threats through SP 800-190, Application  Container Security Guide (see https://nvlpubs.nist.  gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-190.  pdf).  In FY 2017, building on the information in SP 800- 190, this project examined potential security solutions  that provide the necessary countermeasures as well as  the kind of security assurance requirements that each  solution should satisfy in accordance with NISTIR 8176,  Security Assurance Requirements for Linux Application  Container Deployments (see https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/  nistpubs/ir/2017/NIST.IR.8176.pdf). Because security  solutions for containers vary signifcantly based on  Figure 32: Container Technology Stack  90  https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-190.pdf https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-190.pdf https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-190.pdf https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/ir/2017/NIST.IR.8176.pdf https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/ir/2017/NIST.IR.8176.pdf  NIST/ITL CYBERSECURITY PROGRAM ANNUAL REPORT 2017  the OS component (shown as Container OS in Figure  32) and because of their ubiquitous usage in container  deployments, NISTIR 8176 focused on Linux OS- based environments. This decision enabled detailed  security assurance requirements to be defned.  Furthermore, the team recognized that there are  multiple hypervisor products for server virtualization  in current infrastructures. This observation led the  team to modify previous security recommendations to  improve countermeasures against potential threats to  the hypervisor. These countermeasures are agnostic  to any specifc architecture of the hypervisor platform.  The modifed recommendations were published  for public comment in the second draft of SP 800- 125A, Security Recommendations for Hypervisor  Deployment (see https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/  detail/sp/800-125a/draft).  NIST contributed signifcant material that led  to the creation of ISO/IEC Committee Draft 21878,  Security Guidelines for Design and Implementation  of Virtualized Servers, in April 2017. The draft was co- edited by a CSD computer scientist and drew from  information in seven NIST conference papers and  four technical publications regarding security for the  virtualized infrastructure.  NIST recognizes that application container  technology is being increasingly used to develop  applications with microservices-based architectures.  In FY 2018, this project plans to focus on security issues  arising from technology components involved in that  architecture. Developments in virtual networking  and virtual storage technologies will be monitored  to update our security recommendations for secure  deployment of these technologies.

Cyber threat information includes  indicators (i.e., artifacts or observable events that  suggest that an attack is imminent, that an attack is  underway, or that a compromise may have already  occurred); information about the tactics, techniques,  and procedures (TTPs) of actors; recommended  courses of action; and other information that is used to  characterize threats. Because threat actors often use  the same TTPs against multiple targets, exchanging  cyber threat information allows organizations to  leverage the collective knowledge, experience, and  analysis capabilities of their peers, thereby increasing  the overall awareness and security of an entire  sharing community. Through the exchange of cyber  threat information, organizations can gain a more  complete understanding of their threat environment  by correlating their observations with those of others.  CSD has established a cyber threat information- sharing initiative, which is focused on providing  guidance on how an organization can establish  information sharing and coordination capabilities  that enhance or augment their existing cybersecurity  practices. The guidance covers threat-informed  detection, protection and response capabilities; data  privacy and sensitivity; data collection and retention  practices; the use of open standards for information  exchange; de-identifcation and anonymization;  and guidance on how an organization can establish,  participate in, and maintain coordination and  information-sharing relationships. The guidance will  help incident responders, network defenders, and  operations personnel consider what information is  sharable, the circumstances under which sharing is  allowed, with whom the information may be shared,  and how the information should be protected.  In October 2016, CSD published SP 800-150, Guide  to Cyber Threat Information Sharing. This publication  helps organizations prepare for an exchange of  cyber threat information, both consuming cyber  threat information from external sources and  producing information for other organizations to  use. Organizations may have diferent capabilities for  detecting threats, responding to attacks, diagnosing  causes, and handling sensitive incident-related  information, but this guidance is intended to help  organizations collaborate and exchange cyber threat  information despite these organizational diferences.  91  https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800-125a/draft https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800-125a/draft mailto:mouli@nist.gov  ITL CYBERSECURITY PROGRAM AND PROJECTS  |  FY 2017  In May 2017, NIST conducted a Threat Intelligence  Working Session as part of the Cybersecurity  Framework Workshop. The working session provided  an opportunity for attendees to provide comments on  the use of cyber threat intelligence in the Framework,  to help shape future enhancements to the Framework,  and to share experiences regarding the use of cyber  threat intelligence in the Framework. NIST used the  feedback received during the workshop and the  public review process as input when updating the  Cybersecurity Framework Version 1.1 and its roadmap.  Throughout the year, CSD engaged with  government, industry, and academia to research  protocols, data models, and standards that enable  cyber threat information sharing and support near  real-time cybersecurity decision-making and security  operations.  In FY 2018, CSD plans to continue to conduct  research, prepare guidance, and take part in  standards development activities that foster greater  interoperability and increase the operational tempo  through near real-time cyber threat information  sharing, including:  • Expressing cyber threat information using  machine-readable formats,  • Developing automated mechanisms for  exchanging cyber threat information,  • Describing automated courses of action,  • Publishing cyber threat information metadata,  and  • Safeguarding cyber threat information.  NIST will also help foster cyber threat information  sharing by supporting information-sharing initiatives  by public and private-sector organizations, including:  • Information Sharing and Analysis Centers  (ISACs),  • Information Sharing and Analysis  Organizations (ISAOs),  • Federal/State/Local agencies,  • Law Enforcement,  • Fusion Centers, and  • Sector Coordinating Councils.

Recently, CSD began  researching general authentication features. This  investigation was prompted by the general call to  move away from passwords toward the growing  number of alternative authentication methods (e.g.,  biometrics, smart cards, etc.). A notional ontology  of authentication is in development that includes a  detailed taxonomy and an assessment approach to  aid in defnitively comparing alternatives.  As the research matures, it is possible to draft  a concept map (see Figure 33) to highlight key  components. There are many intertwining aspects of  authentication, such as the relationships with Identity  Management and Authorization. As more of the  aspects of authentication are identifed and defned,  better development and use of authentication is  expected.  The structure of the authentication taxonomy  (see Figure 34) to encapsulate current and emerging  mechanisms continues to be refned as recent updates  expand the diversity of mechanisms. The taxonomy  includes entity authentication as a wide assortment of  commonly used human-machine, machine-machine,  and human-human methods, all of which are termed  confrmation. Attestation is the term used for afrming  expectations of objects.  92  mailto:christopher.johnson@nist.gov mailto:lee.badger@nist.gov mailto:david.waltermire@nist.gov  NIST/ITL CYBERSECURITY PROGRAM ANNUAL REPORT 2017  - -.. -.., .... -~.  -  �Hi\\1111:�  �ii+  �HH-  • - ...  • - -  �&M+ �lib-  Authentication  Taxonomy  Figure 33: Draft Authentication Concept Map  The notional authentication ontology attempts may overlap or impact the others.

The assessment framework system. To state the issue another way, there appears  separates attributes into security, usability, to be a relation between how much we must ask of the  deployability, and manageability categories (see operator and how willing the operator is to support  Figure 35). It is important to note that each category security rather than (mis)manage it.  Figure 34: Draft Authentication Taxonomy 93  ITL CYBERSECURITY PROGRAM AND PROJECTS  |  FY 2017  Deployability  Usability Manageability  Figure 35: Suitability Framework for Authentication  Specifc methods of assessment in these  categories are not developed and are expected to  be unique to each authentication mechanism and  dependent on the environment. The assessment  framework also includes integration with the  programmatic categories of deployability and  manageability. What is known is that these are unlikely  to be reduced to a single value, but will have to be  assessed across several independent constructs.  Future programmatic eforts will be focused  toward a NISTIR to describe the research results,  encourage further discussion with the community,  and provide recommendations for future standards  development eforts. The goal is to move toward  specifying independent strength requirements  rather than specifc implementation requirements.  Upon completion of the NISTIR, work will begin on a  suitability matrix that will aid the user in determining  how best to apply and assess the assessment  framework. Concerns as to the adoptability of  this approach will be addressed. Additional work  to identify interdependencies among identity  management and authorization controls and  requirements should aid in unifying the approach. As  a clear assessment approach is defned, future identity  management, authentication, and authorization  process implementations can address vulnerabilities  of individual or combined solutions.

For  example, Veteran Afairs’ hospital systems are often  required to meet FISMA, Payment Card Industry (PCI)  and Health Insurance Portability and Accountability  Act (HIPAA) requirements simultaneously. Assessing  and maintaining the security posture of such complex  information systems through manual procedures  leveraging paper-driven approaches is colossal,  inefcient, and often unreliable.  NIST is researching methodologies for enhancing  the security assessment and the near-real-time  monitoring of complex systems. The team is leveraging  cognitive approaches to provide continuous feedback  by highlighting relevant threats, rendering security  enhancements, or augmenting solutions to maintain/  increase systems’ security postures.  During FY 2017, NIST completed a feasibility  assessment and created the project’s research plan,  identifying milestones and deliverables. In FY 2018  and subsequent years, the team will continue the  Cognitive-based Approach to Security Controls  Assessment (CASSA) by researching methods to:  • Identify the relationships between  implemented security and privacy controls for  a targeted information system;  • Analyze the implementation of the security  and privacy controls, providing, as feedback,  a rendered set of suggestions to enhance the  security posture of the system;  • Identify documented and undocumented  vulnerabilities relevant to the system;  • Identify the minimum-resistance penetration  path into the system, providing, as feedback,  rendered recommendations for mitigating the  risk; and  94  mailto:kim.schaffer@nist.gov  NIST/ITL CYBERSECURITY PROGRAM ANNUAL REPORT 2017  • Perform continuous monitoring and analysis  of the system, factoring in the above steps  while providing rendered suggestions for  system enhancements.

OSCAL is attempting to address a number of  challenges around security controls and security  controls assessment. The core challenge, and one  of the primary reasons for creating OSCAL, is that  concepts like security controls and profles are  represented today largely in proprietary ways. In  many cases they are written in prose documents that  are imprecise, lead to diferences in interpretation,  and are not machine-readable, meaning that the  prose instructions require someone to do data entry  into a tool in order for the tool to use the information.  Organizations are also struggling with information  systems that have many diferent components, and  some components require the use of diferent profles  per component, which is commonly the case with  cloud environments. Also, the cloud environments  can be multitenant or have mixed ownership of  components. We need to be able to assess the security  of these systems against a number of requirements,  owners, etc.—to do this simultaneously and provide  these views to stakeholders.  In addition, there are situations where a single  system needs to support multiple regulatory  frameworks. For example, the U.S. Department of  Veterans Afairs is a federal agency (with Federal  Information Security Modernization Act (FISMA)  and NIST Cybersecurity Framework requirements)  and a healthcare institution (with Health Insurance  Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)  requirements) that has credit card transactions  (with requirements specifed in the Payment Card  Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS)). There is  no shortage of requirements for some organizations  that have multiple regulatory frameworks. Assessing  a plethora of security controls rooted on diferent  standards with diferent formatting is a complex  process that is currently largely manual or leverages  proprietary, specifcally customized approaches and  tools.  OSCAL attempts to standardize how  security controls are represented, how a control  implementation for a given system is represented,  and how that information is best used. It supports  the generation of standardized reports that can be  used by both humans and machines. That means  that formats are needed that can be generated by  machines for communicating with other machines,  but can also be easily reformatted so that humans  can read the information. By standardizing the  representation of this information, OSCAL information  can be interoperable because of a well-defned  specifcation with information that’s going to be used,  imported, and subsquently used for security control  assessments. The goal is to keep OSCAL as simple as  possible and provide extensive automation for tools  it uses.  During FY 2017, NIST focused on developing  the control catalog schema and the profle schema,  focusing on addressing a large number of user stories  that describe features, attributes or characteristics.  The team validated the approach with use cases from  SP 800-53 Rev. 4, SP 800-53 Rev. 5 (draft), ISO/IEC  27001 and 27002, and COBIT 5.  In the next year, NIST will continue the  development of the other schemas pertaining to the  project (e.g., the framework schema, implementation  schema and System Security Plan (SSP) representation,  assessment schema, etc.).

The NCCoE’s collaborations  focus on providing practical guidance to technical,  real-world cybersecurity challenges using standards- based, commercially available technologies.  Project Lifecycle  To help accelerate businesses’ adoption of  standards-based, secure technologies, the NCCoE  works collaboratively with stakeholders to:  • Defne and articulate: The NCCoE works  with industry stakeholders, cybersecurity  professionals, academic experts, government  agencies, and others to identify and defne  pressing cybersecurity issues.  • Organize and engage: The NCCoE then  collaborates with stakeholders to refne a  project’s scope and develop detailed technical  descriptions of the problem. The NCCoE also  engages technology vendors via an open  call through the Federal Register, to build a  potential example solution.  • Implement and test: The NCCoE works with  technology vendors that have standards- based, commercially available products  that can be used as part of the example  implementation. These vendors sign a  Cooperative Research and Development  Agreement (CRADA) and help build a  reference design, identify gaps in the build;  and refne the example implementation  until there is a practical, usable, repeatable  reference design that addresses the business  problem.  • Publish and transfer: The NCCoE provides  details of the reference design, standards  mapping, lab implementation, and more  in a NIST SP 1800 series, a three-volume  document that provides applicable guidance  for executives, CISOs or IT directors, and IT  staf.  Types of Collaborators & Partnerships  Vendors, industry stakeholders, academic experts  and others participate in the center through a variety  of collaborative mechanisms as described below:  • Communities of Interest: A Community of  Interest (COI) is a group of professionals and  advisors that share business insights, technical  expertise, challenges, and perspectives to  guide NCCoE projects. The NCCoE relies on  this robust collaboration with experts and  innovators to provide real-world cybersecurity  challenges and inform the reference  designs for standards-based cybersecurity  integrations that address business needs.  • Technology Collaborators: Vendors  who would like to participate in a center  project reply to a Federal Register call for  participation. Vendors who are chosen to  participate sign a CRADA and contribute  their expertise, hardware, or software to the  reference design for a specifc problem.  • National Cybersecurity Excellence  Partnership (NCEP): The NCCoE also works  with technology vendors via the NCEP  program, wherein vendors sign MOUs to  establish a deeper partnership with the  NCCoE. NCEPs can provide hardware,  software, knowledge, personnel, and can  designate guest researchers to work at the  center in person or remotely. The NCCoE  currently has 31 NCEPs, from Fortune  50 market leaders to smaller companies  specializing in IT security.  For more information on NCCoE Partnerships, see  https://nccoe.nist.gov/partners.  SP 1800 Series: Practical Cybersecurity  Guidance  NCCoE projects result in a NIST Special Publication  (SP) 1800 document – a three-volume practice guide,  which is a complement to NIST’s SP 800 series 96  https://nccoe.nist.gov/partners  NIST/ITL CYBERSECURITY PROGRAM ANNUAL REPORT 2017  documents. SP 1800 documents contain an Executive  Summary for business executives, a second volume  for security program managers that details security  approaches and maps security capabilities to the NIST  Cybersecurity Framework as well as other relevant  standards, and a third volume for the cybersecurity  implementation staf that details the steps needed  for another entity to recreate the NCCoE’s example  solution.  In FY 2017, the center published seven practice  guides (up from two in FY 2016 and three in FY 2015)  that provide practical guidance, including a reference  design and implementation details, on standards- based secure technologies:  1. SP 1800-3, Revision 2, Attribute Based  Access Control;  2. SP 1800-6, DNS-Based Email Security;  3. SP 1800-7, Situational Awareness for the  Electric Utilities;  4. SP 1800-8, Securing Wireless Infusion  Pumps in Healthcare Delivery  Organizations;  5. SP 1800-9, Managing Access Rights in the  Financial Services Sector;  6. SP 1800-11, Data Integrity: Recovering  from Ransomware and Other Destructive  Events; and  7. SP 1800-12, Derived Personal Identity  Verifcation (PIV) Credentials.  For more information about NCCoE projects, visit  https://nccoe.nist.gov/projects.  Example: Impact of Guidance on Wireless Infusion  Pumps  Medical devices like infusion pumps were once  standalone instruments. Today, infusion pumps  connect wirelessly to a variety of healthcare systems,  networks, and other devices. Connecting infusion  pumps to point-of-care medication systems and  electronic health records can improve healthcare  delivery processes, but it also increases cybersecurity  risks that could afect operations or safety. Tampering  with the wireless infusion pump ecosystem, whether  intentionally or otherwise, can expose a healthcare  delivery organization to serious risks, including  breaches of protected health information, loss or  disruption of healthcare services, damage to an  organization’s reputation, productivity, and revenue,  or even loss of life.  The NCCoE worked with a community-of-interest  made up of various components of the healthcare  ecosystem to defne the challenge of using wireless  infusion pumps securely, identify relevant standards  and best practices, and create a representative  architecture.  The NCCoE then developed a lab implementation  to demonstrate how healthcare delivery organizations  can use standards-based, commercially available  cybersecurity technologies and industry best  practices. Working with fve major infusion pump  manufacturers, which accounted for 85 % of the  market in America, and innovative cybersecurity  technology vendors, the NCCoE helped highlight  where security capabilities could be built into the  pumps to strengthen the cybersecurity of the devices,  pump ecosystem, and healthcare enterprise. This has  led to multiple pump manufacturers incorporating  security capabilities into the next generation versions  of their pumps.  Collaborating Across Government  The NCCoE’s Work for Others (WFO) Program,  governed by the NCCoE’s Program Management  Ofce (PMO), facilitates the engagement of other  agencies with NIST’s National Cybersecurity Federally  Funded Research and Development Center (FFRDC).  Since 2015, the WFO program has continuously grown  and currently has several interagency agreements  in place, which support projects for the U.S. Coast  Guard, the U.S. Department of Transportation, the U.S.  Air Force, and the Department of Homeland Security.  Example of Government Collaboration: U.S. Coast  Guard and Sector CSF Profles  In early FY 2017, the U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) and  industry representatives worked with NIST to develop  the Maritime Bulk Liquids Transfer Cybersecurity  Framework (CSF) Profle. This profle template helps  organizations in the complex and sophisticated supply  chain of the oil and natural gas industry assess and  monitor their cybersecurity risk (see https://www.dco.  97  https://www.dco.uscg.mil/Portals/9/CG-FAC/Documents/Maritime_BLT_CSF.pdf?ver=2017-07-19-070544-223 https://nccoe.nist.gov/projects  ITL CYBERSECURITY PROGRAM AND PROJECTS  |  FY 2017  uscg.mil/Portals/9/CG-FAC/Documents/Maritime_  BLT_CSF.pdf?ver=2017-07-19-070544-223). Building  on the success of this CSF profle, the USCG asked for  two more profles to be completed: Mobile Of-Shore  Drilling Units and Passenger Vessels.  The goal of these profles is to provide maritime  sub-sectors with guidance for applying the CSF,  leveraging the framework to create a sub-sector  profle that individual companies can tailor and use to  prioritize resources and identify cybersecurity gaps.  This project has helped showcase how the NCCoE  can apply standards and best practices to real-world  industry challenges to help companies more easily  take advantage of existing guidance.  Workshops & Events  Figure 36: The Enhancing Resilience of the Internet  and Communications Ecosystem Workshop  Throughout FY 2017, the NCCoE hosted and  participated in numerous workshops to defne, refne,  and provide guidance on technical cybersecurity  challenges facing businesses today.  For example, the NCCoE hosted NIST’s Workshop  on “Enhancing Resilience of the Internet and  Communications Ecosystem,” which brought together  over a hundred cybersecurity technologists, vendors,  researchers, and subject matter experts. Executive  Order 13800, “Strengthening the Cybersecurity of  Federal Networks and Critical Infrastructure,” required  the Secretaries of Commerce and Homeland Security  to “jointly lead an open and transparent process  to identify and promote action by appropriate  stakeholders to improve the resilience of the internet  and communications ecosystem and to encourage  collaboration with the goal of dramatically reducing  threats perpetrated by automated and distributed  attacks (e.g., botnets).” The workshop was designed  to allow stakeholders to explore a range of current  and emerging solutions addressing automated,  distributed threats in an open and transparent  manner. The workshop’s proceedings were detailed  in NISTIR 8192, published in FY 2017 (see https://csrc.  nist.gov/publications/detail/nistir/8192/fnal). Beyond  NISTIR 8192, the workshop led to the launch of two  new NCCoE projects: Mitigating IoT Based Automated  Distributed Threats and TLS Server Certifcate  Management.  Additionally, the regularly held NCCoE Speaker  Series showcases thought leaders that highlight  critical cybersecurity issues of national importance  across various industries. The Speaker Series is  jointly hosted by the NCCoE, Maryland Department  of Commerce, and Montgomery County Department  of Economic Development in collaboration with the  Maryland Tech Council. This year, the NCCoE hosted  four Speaker Series events, whose topics ranged from  how small businesses can utilize the NIST CSF, to  cybersecurity threats in the hospitality sector, to the  psychology behind insider threats.  The NCCoE also hosted multiple in-person  workshops with its NCEP partners – in February  at the RSA Conference and in September at  Juniper Networks’ headquarters in Sunnyvale, CA.  The workshops brought together dozens of top  cybersecurity experts from nearly all the partner  organizations to discuss critical cybersecurity  challenges, from identity to artifcial intelligence, that  may beneft from NCCoE guidance.  Learn more about the NCCoE’s events at https://  nccoe.nist.gov/events.  Looking Ahead  Building on the robust stakeholder engagement  seen in FY 2017, the NCCoE expects to accelerate the  number of projects undertaken in FY 2018, reinforcing  the importance of the Healthcare, Financial Services,  and Energy industries as well as expanding work in  identity and access management, the Internet of  Things, and Internet infrastructure. 98  https://www.dco.uscg.mil/Portals/9/CG-FAC/Documents/Maritime_BLT_CSF.pdf?ver=2017-07-19-070544-223 https://www.dco.uscg.mil/Portals/9/CG-FAC/Documents/Maritime_BLT_CSF.pdf?ver=2017-07-19-070544-223 https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/nistir/8192/final https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/nistir/8192/final  NIST/ITL CYBERSECURITY PROGRAM ANNUAL REPORT 2017  ROUTER SECURITY  Legitimate BGPt  Route to  Enterprise A Data Traffic to Enterprise A ---­ HJacked to Attacker 's Network  Forged BGP  Route to  ' Enterprise A  . •- ' •- - ' :, . ............

The research focuses on the development  of measurement and modeling techniques necessary  to understand, predict, and control the behavior of  Internet-scale networked information systems. The  ITL staf use these techniques to guide the design,  analysis, and standardization of new technologies  aimed at improving the robustness of the Internet’s  core infrastructure. Recent eforts have focused on  enhancing the security of several of the foundational  routing and communications protocols - the Internet’s  Domain Name System (DNS), Border Gateway  Protocol (BGP), and Electronic mail (Email) and  messaging infrastructures. In addition, the IIP  program addresses other systemic vulnerabilities in  core Internet technologies such as those that enable  massive scale Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS)  attacks.  The Robust Inter-Domain Routing (RIDR) project  aims to remedy serious security and robustness  vulnerabilities in the Internet’s global BGP routing  system.

BGPsec provides the ability  to use digital signatures to prevent both malicious  and accidental unauthorized routing messages from  efecting Internet global routing operations.  In addition to standards development, NIST  developed and released an open source reference  implementation of emerging IETF BGPsec  specifcations, on-line test tools to foster their adoption  and measurement systems to track their operational  deployment. Figure 37 is a visualization generated by  one such monitoring tool that shows the current state  of Route Origin Authorizations (ROAs) in the global  Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI). The RPKI  has been designed to provide the trust infrastructure  upon which Internet routing security technologies can  be based.  In FY 2017, as BGPsec and RPKI technology  specifcations and implementations matured, ITL  shifted its eforts to focus on technology transition  and operational issues associated with the new  secure routing technologies. The ITL staf and its  collaborators published research results on high- speed BGPsec implementations that attempt to  minimize the operational performance impact of  routing security.

These IT environments are under constant threat of  attack and are frequently undergoing change, with  new and updated software being deployed along  with updated confgurations. The wide variety of  computing products, the dynamic nature of software,  the speed of confguration change, and the diversity  of threats require organizations to maintain situational  awareness over their IT assets and to utilize this  information to make informed risk-based decisions.  Security automation utilizes standardized data  formats and transport protocols to enable data to  be exchanged between business, operational, and  security systems that support security processes by:  • Identifying IT assets, including hardware,  software, and data;  • Providing awareness over the operational  state of computing devices;  • Enabling security reference data to be  collected from internal and external sources;  and  • Supporting analysis processes that measure  the efectiveness of security controls and  provide visibility into security risks, enabling  risk-based decision making.  Commercial solutions built using security  automation specifcations enable the collection and  harmonization of vast amounts of operational and  security data into coherent, comparable information  streams to achieve situational awareness that allows  the timely and active management of diverse IT  systems. Through the creation of reference data  and guidance and the international recognition of  fexible, open standards, the NIST security automation  program works to improve the interoperability, broad  acceptance, and adoption of security automation  solutions to address current and future security  challenges, creating opportunities for innovation.  Specifcation, Standards, and  Guidance Development  To support the overarching security automation  vision, it is necessary to have specifcations that  describe the required interactions between systems,  standards that document international consensus  approaches, and guidance for product developers and  implementers. Through close work with partners in  government, industry, and academia, CSD continues  to facilitate the defnition and development of security  automation approaches that enable organizations to  understand and manage IT security risks.  During FY 2017, CSD has continued to build on  previous security automation work, as follows:  • Identifed and addressed gaps in the current  specifcations;  • Evolved existing approaches to achieve  greater scalability and impact;  • Participated in working groups in standards  development organizations to promote  international consensus around standardized  approaches;  • Provided additional guidance on architectural,  design, and analysis concerns; and  • Developed and maintained tools and reference  implementations.  CSD is currently working with its partners in various  standards-development organizations, including  ISO, IETF, the Organization for the Advancement  of Structured Information Standards (OASIS), the  Forum of Incident Response and Security Teams  (FIRST), and the Trusted Computing Group (TCG), to  further mature and broaden the adoption of security  automation specifcations, reference data, and  techniques. This area of work is focused on evolving  security automation specifcations to integrate with  existing transport protocols to provide for the secure,  interoperable exchange of security automation data.  Additional work is focused on evolving security 102  NIST/ITL CYBERSECURITY PROGRAM ANNUAL REPORT 2017  metrics and providing consensus guidance on security  automation approaches. Through the defnition  and adoption of security automation standards  and guidelines, IT vendors will be able to provide  standardized security solutions to their customers.  These solutions support continuous monitoring and  automated, dynamic network defense capabilities,  based on the analysis of data from operational and  security data sources and the collective action of  security components.  Additionally, CSD is working with the vulnerability  community to enable the automated analysis of  metrics such as the Common Vulnerability Scoring  System (CVSS), establishing a baseline of the  minimum information needed to properly inform the  vulnerability management process, and facilitating the  sharing of vulnerability information across language  barriers. To assist in this work, a public draft of NISTIR  8138, Vulnerability Description Ontology (VDO): A  Framework for Characterizing Vulnerabilities, was  created to foster a conversation and collect feedback  on the best mechanisms to improve the degree  of automation within vulnerability management  processes. CSD is planning to develop this document  iteratively by releasing additional drafts in FY 2018 to  ensure participation from as many stakeholders in the  vulnerability community as possible.  Security automation standardization work has  been focused in three areas: the evolution and  international adoption of the Security Content  Automation Protocol (SCAP), the development of  software asset management standards to support  operational and cybersecurity use cases, and the  development of security automation consensus  standards. The following sections detail this work.  Security Content Automation  Protocol (SCAP)  SCAP is a multipurpose protocol that provides  an automated means to collect and assess the state  of devices. SCAP supports automated vulnerability  checking, verifying the installation of patches,  checking security confguration settings, verifying  technical-control compliance, measuring security, and  examining systems for indicators of a compromise.  SCAP uses the Extensible Markup Language (XML) to  standardize the format and nomenclature by which  security software products communicate information  about software faws, security confgurations, and  other aspects of the device state. SCAP enables  security automation content, also known as “SCAP  content,” to be expressed using standardized  formats, identifers, and scoring models. This content  can be used by any tool that is conformant to the  specifcations to collect and evaluate the state of  software installed on a device.  Credit: Shutterstock/Den Rise  SCAP has been widely adopted by major  software and hardware manufacturers and has  become a signifcant component of information  security management and governance programs.  SCAP-enabled tools are currently being used by the  U.S. Government, critical infrastructure companies,  academia, and other businesses, both domestically  and internationally. Currently, CSD is leveraging  SCAP in multiple areas, both to support its own  mission and to enable other agencies and private- sector entities to meet their goals. For CSD, SCAP is  a critical component of the SCAP Validation Program,  the National Vulnerability Database (NVD), and the  National Checklist Program (NCP).  In September 2012, CSD published SP 800-126  Revision 2, The Technical Specifcation for the Security  Content Automation Protocol (SCAP): SCAP Version  1.2. That document describes the 11 component  specifcations composing SCAP. See Table 3 for details.  Since the release of SCAP 1.2, CSD has worked  to improve guidance for using SCAP specifcations.  In FY 2015, CSD released draft NISTIR 8058, Security  103  ITL CYBERSECURITY PROGRAM AND PROJECTS  |  FY 2017  Content Automation Protocol (SCAP) Version 1.2  Content Style Guide: Best Practices for Creating  and Maintaining SCAP 1.2 Content, which provides  guidance for SCAP 1.2 content creators to ensure that  stylistic variations in SCAP 1.2 content are addressed  in a way that improves the accuracy and consistency  of results, avoids performance problems, reduces  user efort, lowers content maintenance burdens, and  enables content reuse. To achieve this, NISTIR 8058  documents best practices for content creation and  encourages their use by SCAP content authors and  maintainers. Feedback on this document is welcomed  and will help CSD to work toward producing a fnal  version of this NISTIR 8058.  Credit: Shutterstock/Titima Ongkantong  CSD is actively working on an SCAP 1.3 revision. In  July 2016, CSD posted drafts for public comment of  SP 800-126 Revision 3 and SP 800-126A. SP 800-126  Revision 3, is The Technical Specifcation for the Security  Content Automation Protocol (SCAP): SCAP Version  1.3. SP 800-126A is SCAP 1.3 Component Specifcation  Version Updates: An Annex to NIST Special Publication  800-126 Revision 3. These publications collectively  document the draft requirements for SCAP 1.3. SP  800-126A is a new publication that allows SCAP 1.3 to  take advantage of selected minor version updates of  SCAP component specifcations, as well as designated  Open Vulnerability and Assessment Language (OVAL)  platform schema revisions. The SCAP 1.3 revision  includes the following changes:  • Adoption of the Open Vulnerability and  Assessment Language (OVAL) 5.11.1, which  was released in April 2015;  • Adoption of the Common Vulnerability  Scoring System (CVSS) v3, which was  released in June 2015;  • Removal of support for CVSSv2; and  • Deprecation of support for older specifcation  revisions and SCAP 1.0.  CSD is currently working to publish the fnal  versions of the publications described above in  early FY 2018. CSD has published a beta release of  an updated version of SCAPVal, the SCAP content  validation tool. A fnal version of this tool will be  provided after the SP 800-126 documents have been  fnalized. CSD is also working to update the SCAP  Validation Program to support SCAP 1.3, with an  update to NISTIR 5711 to be posted in early FY 2018.  More information on SCAP 1.3 can be found at: https://  csrc.nist.gov/Projects/Security-Content-Automation- Protocol/SCAP-Releases/SCAP-1-3.  CSD is also starting to plan an SCAP 2.0 release  (SCAP v2). This release will further defne the  interfaces and use of transport protocols for SCAP  tools to provide component-level interoperability  between products supporting various SCAP  functions. By providing more interoperability, SCAP  v2 will provide the basic software and confguration  posture information needed to make and automate  management decisions for networked devices as  part of the license, vulnerability and confguration  management practices, supporting improved  networked device hygiene. Furthermore, the posture  information provided by SCAP v2 products will provide  much of the context needed to prevent, detect, and  respond to network attacks. This additional context  will enable SCAP v2 information to be applied for  application whitelisting, the detection of anomalous  behavior, the gathering and use of indicators, the  use of machine-readable threat information, and for  orchestrating courses of action. CSD is preparing a  draft whitepaper for release in early FY 2018 that will  outline an approach, a development plan identifying  the new and revised specifcations that will be  needed, and a transition plan for moving from SCAP  1.x to SCAP 2.0. A discussion draft of the SCAP 2.0  specifcation addressing software asset management  and vulnerability management use cases will also  be published in FY 2018 as a way to start a broader  conversation with the SCAP community about where  to focus next on the development of SCAP 2.0. 104  https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/Security-Content-Automation-Protocol/SCAP-Releases/SCAP-1-3 https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/Security-Content-Automation-Protocol/SCAP-Releases/SCAP-1-3 https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/Security-Content-Automation-Protocol/SCAP-Releases/SCAP-1-3  NIST/ITL CYBERSECURITY PROGRAM ANNUAL REPORT 2017  SPECIFICATIONS DESCRIPTION  Languages  Extensible Confguration Checklist Description  Format (XCCDF) 1.2  Used for authoring security checklists/benchmarks  and for reporting the results of evaluating them  Open Vulnerability and Assessment Language  (OVAL) 5.11.2  Used for representing system-confguration  information, assessing machine state, and reporting  assessment results  Open Checklist Interactive Language (OCIL) 2.0  Used for representing checks that collect information  from people or from existing data stores populated  by other data collection methods  Reporting Formats  Asset Reporting Format (ARF) 1.1  Used to express information about assets and to  defne the relationships between assets and reports  Asset Identifcation 1.1  Used to uniquely identify assets based on known  identifers and other asset information  Identifcation Schemes  Common Platform Enumeration (CPE) 2.3  A nomenclature and dictionary of hardware,  operating systems, and applications; a method to  identify the applicability to platforms  Software Identifcation (SWID) Tags 2015  A structured metadata format for describing a  released software product  Common Confguration Enumeration (CCE) 5  A nomenclature and dictionary of software-security  confgurations  Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE)  A nomenclature and dictionary of security-related  software faws  Measurement and Scoring Systems  Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)  Used for measuring the relative severity of software  faws  Common Confguration Scoring System (CCSS)  Used for measuring the relative severity of device  security (mis-)confguration issues  Content and Result Integrity  Trust Model for Security Automation Data (TMSAD)  Guidance for using digital signatures in a common  trust model applied to security automation  specifcations  TABLE 3: SCAP 1.2 SPECIFICATIONS  105  ITL CYBERSECURITY PROGRAM AND PROJECTS  |  FY 2017  LEGEND  ~ CORPUS  ~ PRIMARY  ~ SUPPLEMENTAL  ~ PATCH  Software Asset Management  Standards  CSD has been collaborating with industry  partners to promote the adoption of ISO/IEC  19770-2:2015, Information technology—Software  asset management—Part 2: Software identifcation  tag, which establishes a specifcation for tagging  software to support identifcation and management.  The software identifcation (SWID) data model  defned by this standard describes an XML format  for software publishers to provide authoritative  identifcation, categorization, software relationships  (e.g., dependency, bundling, and patching),  executable and library footprint details, and other  metadata for software. This information can be used  to support operational and cybersecurity use cases  around managing software deployments, managing  software licenses, managing software vulnerabilities  and related software patches, and assessing secure  software confgurations.  To supplement the requirements in ISO/IEC  19770-2:2015, CSD collaborated with DHS, NSA,  and MITRE on the development of NISTIR 8060,  Guidelines for the Creation of Interoperable Software  Identifcation (SWID) Tags. NISTIR 8060, published in  April 2016, provides an overview of the capabilities  and usage of SWID tags as part of a comprehensive  software lifecycle. This report introduces SWID  tags in an operational context, provides guidelines  for the creation of interoperable SWID tags, and  highlights key usage scenarios for which SWID tags  are applicable. Figure 39 illustrates several types of  SWID tags (as indicated in the legend) and how these  support multiple elements of the software product  life cycle, including deployment, installation, patching,  upgrading and removal.  Figure 39: SWID Tags Support the Software Product Lifecycle  Additionally, in FY 2017, NIST has worked with  the IETF to integrate SWID tags into the Network  Endpoint Assessment (NEA) protocol, through the  Software Inventory Message and Attributes (SWIMA)  for PA-TNC specifcation (see https://datatracker.ietf.  org/doc/draft-ietf-sacm-nea-swima-patnc/). This  draft Request for Comments (RFC) will be published  soon, describing a method for the automated, event-  based collection of software inventory information  using SWID tag information.  The information provided within SWID tags  enhances the SCAP use cases by providing  authoritative information that can be used to create  Common Platform Enumeration (CPE) names, to  support the targeting of checklists, and to associate 106  software faws to products, based on a defect in  https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-sacm-nea-swima-patnc/ https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-sacm-nea-swima-patnc/  NIST/ITL CYBERSECURITY PROGRAM ANNUAL REPORT 2017  a software library or executable. In FY 2017, CSD  published a SWID tag validation tool (see https://  scap.nist.gov/specifcations/swid/), called SWIDVal,  that can validate a SWID tag document against the  ISO/IEC 19770-2:2015 and NISTIR 8060 requirements.  Development of Security Automation  Consensus Standards  CSD has been promoting the broad international  adoption of SCAP by encouraging the integration of  SCAP into other standards, and by adapting SCAP  to address specifc gaps and challenges. CSD has  continued its collaboration with its industry partners  in the IETF Security Automation and Continuous  Monitoring (SACM) working group. This working  group provides a venue for advancing appropriate  SCAP specifcations into international standards and  addressing identifed gap areas. The current scope of  work for SACM includes identifying and/or defning  the transport protocols and data formats needed  to support the collection and evaluation of details  regarding a device’s state against the expected  values. The SACM working group has been working on  identifying use cases, requirements, and architectural  models to provide information to facilitate decisions  about existing specifcations and standards that can  be referenced, required modifcations or extensions  to existing specifcations and standards, and any gaps  that need to be addressed. CSD is working with DHS,  the Center for Internet Security (CIS), and the TCG  to bring existing work into the IETF SACM working  group, including OVAL and specifcations related to  the Trusted Network Connect (TNC) protocol.  For more information, please refer to: http://  datatracker.ietf.org/wg/sacm/charter/.  Also, within the IETF, CSD has been collaborating  with the Managed Incident Lightweight Exchange  (MILE) working group in order to develop the  Resource-Oriented Lightweight Information Exchange  (ROLIE) specifcation. This specifcation seeks  to address the security automation information  discovery and dissemination use cases by defning  how tools are expected to communicate with security  automation information repositories. ROLIE allows for  the transport, retrieval, and storage of any security  automation-relevant information types. The ROLIE  draft has undergone two major revisions, with the  fnal draft nearing completion. In addition, CSD has  begun the process of collaborating with MILE and  other stakeholders to create extension drafts for  ROLIE that address a number of information types,  including vulnerability, confguration checklist, and  software metadata information types.  The main ROLIE draft can be found at https://  datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-mile-rolie/.  Additional information on ROLIE and on the extension  drafts can be found in the working repository on  GitHub: https://github.com/CISecurity/ROLIE/.  CSD also worked with its government and  industry partners in the TCG to defne a number  of specifcations related to the Trusted Network  Connect (TNC) protocol. The frst such publication  is the TNC SCAP Messages for IF-M specifcation  that supports carrying the SCAP content and results  over the TNC protocols. IF-M is a messaging protocol  that helps communicate measurement information  about endpoints for evaluation against security  policy. The second is the TNC Endpoint Compliance  Profle (ECP) and related specifcations that support  the exchange of SWID data over the TNC protocols.  The ECP enables the collection of SWID data from a  device for use by external tools to provide software  inventory information. SCAP and SWID data collected  using these mechanisms may be optionally used for  network access control decision making, allowing the  device state to be evaluated when devices connect  and on an ongoing basis thereafter.  For more information on this specifcation,  please visit: http://www.trustedcomputinggroup.  org/resources/tnc_endpoint_compliance_profle_  specifcation.  Updated versions of the ECP and SWID-related  specifcations, along with a usage scenario around  vulnerability assessment, are currently being worked  on in the SACM and MILE working groups, which are  available through the locations indicated in Table 4.

Additionally, CSD has several members who are  actively engaged on the CVE Board, which is working  to improve the assignment of CVE identifers for  vulnerabilities, with the overall goal of improving  the automated processing of vulnerabilities and the  timeliness of CVE identifer issuance.  Finally, CSD has worked with FIRST by  participating in two Special Interest Groups (SIGs).  The CVSS SIG (CVSS-SIG) is focused on maintaining  and improving the CVSS scoring model, based on  community feedback. The CVSS-SIG published CVSS  Revision 3 (CVSS v3) in June 2015. The second SIG,  the Vulnerability Reporting and Data eXchange SIG  (VRDX-SIG), researches and recommends methods for  identifying and exchanging vulnerability information  across disparate vulnerability databases.  For more information, please visit: http://www.  frst.org/global/sigs.  Through work with international standards- developing organizations (SDOs), SCAP and its  related security automation capabilities are expected  to evolve and expand in support of the growing need  to defne and measure efective security controls,  assess and monitor ongoing aspects of information  security, remediate noncompliance, and successfully  manage systems in accordance with the Risk  Management Framework described in SP 800-37  Revision 1, Guide for Applying the Risk Management  Framework to Federal Information Systems: A Security  Life Cycle Approach.

SCAP and the programs that leverage it are moving  the information assurance industry toward being  able to standardize communications and toward the  collection and storage of relevant data in standardized  formats, as well as providing an automated means for  the assessment and remediation of systems for both  vulnerabilities and confguration compliance.  National Vulnerability Database  (NVD)  Security automation reference data is currently  housed within the NVD. The NVD is a comprehensive  cybersecurity vulnerability database that allows  the tracking of vulnerability trends over time. This  trending service allows users to assess changes in  vulnerability discovery rates within specifc products  or within specifc types of vulnerabilities. NVD data  is represented using the SCAP specifcations. The  NVD includes databases of security confguration  checklists for the NCP, listings of publicly known  software faws, product names, and impact metrics. A  formal validation program tests the ability of vendor  products to use some forms of security automation  data, based on a product’s conformance in support of  specifc enterprise capabilities.  SCAP defnes the structure of standardized  software faws and security confguration reference  data, also known as SCAP content. This reference data  is provided by the NVD.  As of the end of September 2017, the NVD  contained the following resources:  • Over 96,000 vulnerability advisories, with an  average of 62 new vulnerabilities added daily;  • 183 SCAP-expressed checklists across 123  platforms containing thousands of low-level  security confguration checks that can be  used by SCAP-validated security products to  perform automated evaluations of the system  state;  • 293 non-SCAP security checklists (e.g., English  prose guidance and confguration scripts);  • 249 U.S. Computer Emergency Readiness  Team (US-CERT) alerts; 4,467 US-CERT  vulnerability summaries; and 10,286 SCAP  machine-readable software faw checks; and  • A product dictionary with over 124,000  operating system, application, and hardware  name entries; and over 75,000 vulnerability  advisories translated into Spanish.  NVD is hosted and maintained by NIST and is  sponsored by the Department of Homeland Security’s  US-CERT.  The use of SCAP data by commercial security  products, deployed in thousands of organizations  worldwide, has extended NVD’s efective reach.  Increasing demand for NVD XML data feeds (i.e.,  mechanisms that provide updated data from data  sources) and SCAP-expressed content from the NVD  website demonstrates an increased adoption of SCAP.  In the past year, the NVD began providing CVSS  base scores following the CVSS v3 specifcation within  the data feeds and completed a major enhancement  to the overall user interface. The NVD has also seen a  signifcant increase (almost three fold) in vulnerabilities  received and analyzed over the previous year. Overall,  the NVD has experienced an average download  growth rate of over 10 % per month.

Vulnerabilities in IT  products are discovered daily, and many ready-to- use exploitation techniques are widely available on  the Internet. Because IT products are often intended  for a wide variety of audiences, restrictive security  confguration controls are usually not enabled by  default. As a result, many out-of-the box IT products  are immediately vulnerable. In addition, identifying  a reasonable set of security settings that achieve  balanced risk management is a complicated, arduous,  and time-consuming task, even for experienced  system administrators.  Credit: Shutterstock/Natali_ Mis  To facilitate the development of security  confguration checklists for IT products and to  make checklists more organized and usable, CSD  established the National Checklist Program (NCP)  in furtherance of its statutory responsibilities under  the Federal Information Security Management Act  (FISMA) of 2002, Public Law 107-347, and also under  the Cybersecurity Research and Development Act,  which mandates that NIST “develop, and revise as  necessary, a checklist setting forth settings and option  selections that minimize the security risks associated  with each computer hardware or software system  that is, or is likely to become, widely used within the  Federal Government.” In February 2008, a revision  of Part 39 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation  (FAR) was published. Paragraph (d) of section 39.101  states, “In acquiring information technology, agencies  shall include the appropriate IT security policies and  requirements, including the use of common security  confgurations available from the NIST website at  https://checklists.nist.gov. Agency contracting ofcers  should consult with the requiring ofcial to ensure  that the appropriate standards are incorporated.”  In Memorandum M-08-22, OMB mandated the  use of SCAP-validated products for the continuous  monitoring of Federal Desktop Core Confguration  (FDCC) compliance. The NCP strives to encourage  and assist federal agencies with these mandates.  The goals of the NCP are to:  • Facilitate the development and sharing of  checklists by providing a formal framework for  checklist developers to submit checklists to  NIST;  • Provide guidance to developers to help  them create standardized, high quality  checklists that conform to common operation  environments;  • Help developers and users by providing  guidelines for making checklists better  documented and more usable;  • Encourage software vendors and other parties  to develop checklists;  • Provide a managed process for the review,  update, and maintenance of checklists;  • Provide an easy-to-use repository of  checklists; and  • Encourage the use of automation technologies  (e.g., SCAP) for checklist application.  At the end of FY 2017, there are a total of 476  checklists posted on the NCP website (see https://  checklists.nist.gov/). Of that total, 183 of the checklists,  addressing 123 platforms, are SCAP-expressed and  can be used with SCAP-validated products.  Organizations can use the checklists obtained  from the NCP website for automated security  confguration patch assessment. The NCP currently  provides metadata and links to the latest operating 110  https://checklists.nist.gov https://checklists.nist.gov/ https://checklists.nist.gov/  NIST/ITL CYBERSECURITY PROGRAM ANNUAL REPORT 2017  systems and applications checklists, including MacOS  10.10, Windows 10, Internet Explorer 11.0, Internet  Explorer 10.0, Ofce 2016, Red Hat Enterprise Linux,  and other products.  To assist users in identifying automated checklist  content, NCP groups these checklists into tiers, from  Tier I to Tier IV. The NCP uses the tiers to rank checklists  according to their automation capability. Tier III and  IV checklists include fully vetted SCAP content that  has successfully demonstrated conformance to the  requirements outlined in SP 800-126. Tier III & IV  checklists are considered production-ready and are  intended for use with SCAP-validated products. Tier  II checklists document the recommended security  settings in a machine-readable format such as the  XCCDF-only (i.e., no OVAL content), proprietary  format, or product-specifc confguration script. Tier  I checklists are prose-based and contain no machine- readable content.  Users can browse the checklists, based on the  checklist tier, IT product, IT product category, or  authority, and through a keyword search that searches  the checklist name and summary for user-specifed  terms. The search results show the detailed checklist  metadata and a link to any SCAP content for the  checklist, as well as links to any supporting resources  associated with the checklist.  To assist checklist developers, the NCP provides  both manual and automated interfaces to facilitate the  submission and maintenance processes. The manual  interface consists of a web application that guides the  submitter through the data entry process to ensure  that all the required information is submitted. The  submission is validated upon review, and a report is  returned to the submitting organization, verifying  either acceptance or rejection, based on the criteria  requirements. For instance, Tier III and Tier IV  checklists require validation using the SCAP Content  Validation Tool (this tool is available for download via  https://scap.nist.gov/).  The NCP is defned in SP 800-70 Revision  3, National Checklist Program for IT Products—  Guidelines for Checklist Users and Developers, which  can be found at https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/  PubsSPs.html.  In 2017, NIST released a draft version of SP 800- 70 Revision 4, which can be viewed at https://csrc.  nist.gov/CSRC/media/Publications/sp/800-70/rev-4/  draft/documents/sp800-70r4-draft.pdf. SP 800-70  Revision 4 will be published as fnal in FY 2018, and  the checklists.nist.gov website will be modifed to  refect the updated document.

The confgurations are based  on a collection of resources, including the existing  NIST macOS confguration guidance, the Defense  Information Systems Agency (DISA) macOS Security  Technical Implementation Guide (STIG), and the  Center for Internet Security (CIS) macOS Security  Benchmark.  The project team researched and tested  approximately 270 settings for macOS 10.12. The  confguration set has been signifcantly reduced due  to changes in the operating system’s features and  default setting values. Among other collected data,  each setting has a designated Common Confguration  Enumeration (CCE) number, which aids in its long- term tracking. Figure 40 illustrates the various  categories that comprise the baselines. Note that  a higher quantity of settings in a category does not  imply greater importance over other categories.  111  https://scap.nist.gov/ https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/PubsSPs.html https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/PubsSPs.html https://csrc.nist.gov/CSRC/media/Publications/sp/800-70/rev-4/draft/documents/sp800-70r4-draft.pdf https://csrc.nist.gov/CSRC/media/Publications/sp/800-70/rev-4/draft/documents/sp800-70r4-draft.pdf https://csrc.nist.gov/CSRC/media/Publications/sp/800-70/rev-4/draft/documents/sp800-70r4-draft.pdf https://checklists.nist.gov/ https://checklists.nist.gov mailto:stephen.quinn@nist.gov  ITL CYBERSECURITY PROGRAM AND PROJECTS  |  FY 2017  Integrity, 5  Loca I Services, 6  Speech,4  Finder, 3  Screen Saver, 6  Updates, 5  Network Services, 21  Built-in A!pplications, 6  Access Control, 5  Authent ication , 22  Firewall, 29  Power Management, 4  SSH,15 I Total: 145  Figure 40: Confguration Categories  The shell scripts that apply the settings to a macOS  10.12 system are organized into three key baselines,  which are appropriate for diferent environments:  • The Standalone baseline describes small,  informal computer installations that are used  for home or business purposes;  • The Managed baseline is appropriate for  centrally managed, networked systems; and  • The Specialized Security-Limited Functionality  (SSLF) baseline is appropriate for systems  where security requirements are more  stringent and where the implementation  of security safeguards is likely to reduce  functionality.  In FY 2017, the fnal version of SP 800-179, Guide to  Securing Apple OS X 10.10 Systems for IT Professionals  was published. This document explains the settings,  their security signifcance, and how to confgure them  for the three baselines described above. The project  team then focused on updating the guide, script  and spreadsheet of settings for Apple macOS 10.12  systems.  In FY 2018, the team plans to:  • Produce an updated guide for macOS 10.12;  • Continue to refne the script and add more  settings to the confguration; and  • Investigate macOS 10.13, “High Sierra.”  FOR MORE INFORMATION, SEE:  https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/apple-os-x-security- confguration  https://github.com/usnistgov/applesec 112  https://github.com/usnistgov/applesec https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/apple-os-x-security  NIST/ITL CYBERSECURITY PROGRAM ANNUAL REPORT 2017  CONTACTS:  Mr. Mark Trapnell  Mr. Lee Badger  (301) 975-4091  (301) 975-3176  mark.trapnell@nist.gov lee.badger@nist.gov  Mr. Murugiah Souppaya  (301) 975-8443  murugiah.souppaya@nist.gov  TECHNICAL SECURITY METRICS  Security Risk Analysis of Enterprise  Networks Using Attack Graphs  The protection of computer networks from  malicious intrusions is critical to the economy and  security of the nation. Vulnerabilities are regularly  discovered in software applications that are exploited  to stage cyber attacks. System administrators need  objective metrics to guide and justify decision  making as they manage the security risk of enterprise  networks. The objective of this research is to develop  a standard model for the security risk analysis of  computer networks. A standard model will enable  an organization to answer questions such as “Are  we more secure now than yesterday?” or “How does  the security of one network confguration compare  with another one?” Also, having a standard model to  measure network security will allow users, vendors,  and researchers to evaluate methodologies and  products for network security in a coherent and  consistent manner.  CSD has approached the challenge of network  security analysis by capturing vulnerability  interdependencies and measuring security, based on  how real attackers have penetrated networks. The  methodology used for security risk analysis is based  on attack graphs. CSD analyzes attack paths through a  network, providing a probabilistic metric of the overall  system risk. Through this metric, trade-ofs between  security costs and security benefts are analyzed.  Computer systems are vulnerable to both known  and zero-day attacks. Enterprises have begun to move  parts of their networks from a traditional infrastructure  into cloud computing environments. Cloud providers  ofer virtual servers that can be rented on demand  by users. This paradigm enables cloud customers to  acquire computing resources with high efciency, low  cost and great fexibility. However, it also introduces  many security problems that need to be solved.  Considered as an emerging branch of forensics  that combine network and systems forensics, cloud  forensics addresses post-incident analysis of systems  with the complexities of distributed processing,  multi-tenancy and virtualization. CSD has developed  a framework that shows what evidence can be used  to reconstruct corresponding attack scenarios in  the cloud, and discusses how this framework can be  applied to automate the forensics analysis in the cloud  with the objective of saving a forensics investigator’s  time.  CSD has also developed a layered graphical model  to analyze the impact of cyber attacks on business  processes and services. The model has three layers:  the upper layer models that the business processes  and their dependencies, the middle layer constructs  attack scenarios using evidences in log fles, and the  lowest layer reconstructs the missing attack steps  using system calls. Based on the graph produced from  the three layers, the model computes a quantitative  impact on the business processes. CSD has developed  a case study that shows the usability of this model  and how it can be applied for both forensics analysis  and for mitigating the impact of cyber attacks on the  enterprise infrastructure.  CSD published two papers  in this area:  1. Identifying Evidence for Cloud Forensics  Analysis, International Federation for  Information Processing (IFIP) International  Conference on Digital Forensics, Orlando, FL,  January 29 - February 1, 2017.  2. Towards Actionable Mission Impact  Assessment in the Context of Cloud  Computing, 31st IFIP WG 11.3 Conference on  Data and Application Security and Privacy,  Philadelphia, July 19-21, 2017.  In FY 2018, CSD plans to develop new techniques  and metrics for Cloud Computing forensics analysis  and mission impact analysis. CSD also plans to publish  the results as a NIST report and as white papers in  conferences and journals. 113  mailto:mark.trapnell@nist.gov mailto:lee.badger@nist.gov mailto:murugiah.souppaya@nist.gov  ITL CYBERSECURITY PROGRAM AND PROJECTS  |  FY 2017  FOR MORE INFORMATION, SEE:  https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/measuring-security- risk-in-enterprise-networks/  CONTACT:  Dr. Anoop Singhal  (301) 975-4432  anoop.singhal@nist.gov  Algorithms for Intrusion  Measurement  The Algorithms for Intrusion Measurement (AIM)  project furthers measurement science in designing  and implementing algorithms to both detect attackers  and limit their ability to intrude into a system. Most  of the work leverages graph theory (the math of dots  and lines) and algorithmic complexity analysis (the  math around fast computation). In performing this  work, the AIM project seeks to enhance the nation’s  ability to defend itself from network-borne attacks.  In FY 2017, the AIM project completed research in  several areas: it proved that an important access control  system is scalable, created novel metrics for defense- in-depth measurement, and identifed an important  intrusion detection approach. More specifcally, the  project team accomplished the following:  • The team proved that the NGAC model is  scalable by providing a fast-linear time,  decision algorithm when existing reference  implementations used slow cubic algorithms.  This enables enterprises to reduce insider  threats by tightly controlling data access  through simultaneous instantiation of multiple  access control policies (the research was  published in the Journal of Wireless Mobile  Networks, Ubiquitous Computing, and  Dependable Applications and the Proceedings  of the 2016 International Workshop on  Managing Insider Security Threats).  • The team created novel metrics to measure  the defense-in-depth posture of network  systems. They proved that the metrics are  extremely difcult to calculate (NP-Hard),  and thus provided efcient and accurate  approximation algorithms (this research  was published in the proceedings of the  Proceedings of the 2nd Annual Industrial  Control System Security Workshop).  • The team discovered that n-gram anomaly  detection (the most successful anomaly  detection method to date) can act primarily  as a signature system. This happens, in a form  we call micro-signatures, when removing  attacks from within test data in order to train  on a clean set of data. This result reveals  a new methodology for hybrid anomaly/  signature detection systems while also calling  into question many past anomaly detection  results (this research was published in the  proceedings of the International Symposium  on Foundations and Practice of Security).  In FY 2018, the AIM project will work on evaluating  the privacy of global Internet trafc, architectures for  cryptocurrencies to limit criminal behavior, secure  methods for transactions involving digital goods, and  how to publish trustworthy random numbers using  blockchains and smart contracts.

A NIST investigation of actual failures  has shown that most failures are triggered by one  or two parameters, and progressively fewer by  three, four, or more parameters (see Figure 41); this  relationship is called the Interaction Rule. These results  have important implications for testing software and  systems. If all faults in a system can be triggered by  a combination of n or fewer parameters, then testing  all n-way combinations of parameters with a practical  number of tests can provide strong fault detection  efciency. These methods are being applied to  software and hardware testing for reliability, safety,  and security. CSD’s focus is on empirical results and  the impact on real-world problems. 114  https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/measuring-security-risk-in-enterprise-networks/ https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/measuring-security-risk-in-enterprise-networks/ mailto:anoop.singhal@nist.gov https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/aim mailto:peter.mell@nist.gov  NIST/ITL CYBERSECURITY PROGRAM ANNUAL REPORT 2017  100  90  80  70  60  50  40  30  20  10  0  Cumulative proportion of faults fort= 1 .. 6  1 -- FDA  -- MySQL  2 -- Browser 3 -- Server 4 ----· DBMS 5 -- NWSec- 6  ----- MySQL2 - · - Apache2 -- oscs -- NeoKylin  Project highlights for FY 2017 include the  development of a mathematical model that closely  replicates the evolution and distribution of t-way  failures found in empirical studies; invited lectures  at conferences and universities; leading the Sixth  International Workshop on Combinatorial Testing,  held in conjunction with the Ninth IEEE International  Conference on Software Testing; the development of  combinatorial test methods specifc to text search, with  a demonstration of their practical application; and the  development of combinatorial test methods specifc  to cryptographic software that discovered previously  unknown faults in AES algorithm implementations.

Many  security and protection mechanisms are currently  rooted in software that, along with all underlying  components, must be trusted and not tampered  with. A vulnerability in any of those components  could compromise the trustworthiness of the security  mechanisms that rely upon those components.  Stronger security assurances may be possible by  grounding security mechanisms in roots of trust.  Figure 42: Layers of Abstraction within a Mobile  Computing Device  Roots of trust are highly reliable and secure  hardware, frmware, and software components that  perform specifc, critical security functions. Because  roots of trust are inherently trusted, they must be  secure by their design. As such, many roots of trust  are implemented in hardware or protected frmware  so that malware cannot tamper with the functions  they provide. Roots of trust provide a frm foundation  from which to build security and trust.  This project aims to encourage the use of roots  of trust in computers to provide stronger security  assurances. A focus area for this work has been  securing frmware. Previous work in this project  described methods to protect boot frmware as part  of the SP 800-147 series, now standardized by ISO/  IEC JTC 1/SC 27, IT Security Techniques, as ISO/IEC  19678:2015, Information Technology – BIOS Protection  Guidelines.  A new efort in FY 2017 built upon that earlier work  focused on boot frmware to research and develop  techniques and guidelines for securing frmware  throughout the platform. Released for public comment  in May 2017, SP 800-193, Platform Resiliency Guidelines,  provides technical guidelines and recommendations  supporting the resiliency of platform frmware and  data against potentially destructive attacks. These  draft guidelines promote resiliency in the platform by  describing security mechanisms for protecting the  platform against unauthorized changes, detecting  unauthorized changes that occur, and secure recovery  from attacks.  These new draft guidelines have been the basis  for discussions with industry, standards organizations,  and consortiums over technologies, standards, and  specifcations that can improve the resiliency of  computer platforms using roots of trust. Based on  these discussions, NIST expects to fnalize SP 800-193  in FY 2018 and continue outreach to stakeholders in  government, industry, and academia to encourage the  development of more secure and reliable systems.

During FY 2017, the team contributed usability  chapters to SP 800-63, Digital Identity Guidelines,  marking the frst time that there were dedicated  usability chapters in this publication.  Phishing Awareness Training and  Evaluation  During FY 2017, the usability team completed  a long-term operational phishing evaluation,  demonstrating the importance of individual user  context in explaining phishing email click decisions;  this collaboration provided the supporting data  necessary to interpret the previously puzzling  variability in click rates observed across prior years of  operational phishing awareness training exercises.  The team performed research regarding attacks  known as phishing, where a sender initiates an email  containing fraudulent information with the intent of  inducing the recipient to reveal sensitive information.  Phishing continues to be an escalating cyber threat  facing organizations of all types and sizes, including  industry, academia, and government. To help combat  the phishing threat, many organizations utilize  phishing awareness training to make employees  and students more aware of phishing threats and  consequences. Phishing awareness training systems  often use software to emulate real-world threats and  thus train people to recognize and avoid falling victim  to phishing attacks. Using this type of embedded  training system, researchers in the usability group  partnered with NIST’s OISM (Ofce of Information  Systems Management) and OSHE (Ofce of Safety  Health and Environment) to complete three phishing  awareness training exercises with corresponding  surveys, culminating a multi-year phishing awareness  evaluation.  With the data developed, usability researchers  have successfully answered both an operational  assessment question, Why are users clicking or not  clicking on phishing links and attachments?, as well  as the larger institution’s trial deployment question,  Why are click rates so variable? In contrast to previous  research that was primarily performed in laboratory  settings, the present work examines 4.5 years of in  situ embedded simulated phishing emails. The results  have provided additional insights into the rationale  that leads some users to become victims of phishing  attacks and malicious software. Given the variety of  phishing premises and user contexts, no amount of  training will consistently reduce click rates to zero,  but the fndings helped better understand the user’s  role in early detection, combined with technological  solutions, and determined that awareness training  and reporting should be fully supported and even  incentivized in the workforce.

After more than  a year of work NIST has released a suite of documents  covering digital identity from initial risk assessment  to deployment of federated identity solutions. The SP  suite has also been reorganized. SP 800-63-3 is the  base document associated with SP 800-63A, 800- 63B, and 800-63C that covers the various components  of a digital identity system.  In 2004, NIST published the initial version  of Special Publication (SP) 800-63, Electronic  Authentication Guideline. Since then, two revisions  have been published, SP 800-63-2 being published  in August 2013. In late 2015, NIST started considering  a signifcant update to SP 800-63-2 in response to  117  https://www.nist.gov/itl mailto:mary.theofanos@nist.gov mailto:kristen.greene@nist.gov mailto:michelle.steves@nist.gov  ITL CYBERSECURITY PROGRAM AND PROJECTS  |  FY 2017  market innovation, evolving federal requirements,  and an advanced threat landscape targeting remote  authentication. As the frst step in revising the  publication, NIST solicited recommendations from  experts (including those in industry, government, and  educational felds) on which sections of the document  needed revision. Usability surfaced in many comments  as always latent in many security considerations.  The usability team was invited to participate in and  contribute to this year-long major revision efort. The  team participated in weekly meetings with the project  team, performed literature reviews, compiled results  from our own usable security research, and wrote  usability chapters in each of the suite of documents in  the new SP 800-63.  Specifcally, for SP 800-63A, Digital Identity  Guidelines: Enrollment and Identity Proofng, the  usability chapter was written to raise implementers’  awareness of usability considerations associated  with enrollment and identity proofng. For SP 800- 63B, Digital  Identity Guidelines: Authentication  and Lifecycle Management, the usability chapter  provides usability considerations and guidance  on authentication, as integrating usability into the  development process can lead to authentication  solutions that are secure and usable while addressing  users’ authentication needs and organizations’  business goals. For SP 800-63C, Digital Identity  Guidelines: Federation and Assertions, the usability  chapter provides considerations and guidance to  understand user perspectives on online identity, trust  and benefts, and user mental models and beliefs in  order to promote good user experience with federated  identity systems.

The primary goal of  the NIST’s Information Technology Laboratory (ITL)  Cybersecurity Program, is to provide standards  and technology that protects information systems  against threats to the confdentiality, integrity, and  availability of information and services. During Fiscal  Year 2016 (FY 2016), the ITL Cybersecurity Program  successfully responded to numerous challenges  and opportunities in fulflling that mission. Through  ITL’s diverse research agenda and engagement in  many national priority initiatives, high-quality, cost- efective security and privacy mechanisms were  developed and applied that improved information  security across the Federal Government and the  greater information security community.

SP 800-193 (DRAFT)  Platform Firmware Resiliency Guidelines  May 2017 (public comment period: May 30 – July  14, 2017)  https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800- 193/draft  This document provides technical guidelines  and recommendations supporting the resiliency  of platform frmware and data against potentially  destructive attacks. The platform is a collection  of the fundamental hardware and frmware  components needed to boot and operate a  system. A successful attack on platform frmware  could render a system inoperable, perhaps  permanently or requiring reprogramming by  the original manufacturer, resulting in signifcant  disruptions to users. The technical guidelines in this  document promote resiliency in the platform by  describing security mechanisms for protecting the  platform against unauthorized changes, detecting  unauthorized changes that occur,  and recovery  from attacks rapidly and securely. Implementers,  including Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs)  and component/device suppliers, can use these  guidelines to build stronger security mechanisms  into platforms. System administrators, security  professionals, and users can use this document  to guide procurement strategies and priorities for  future systems.  SP 800-192  Verifcation and Test Methods for Access Control  Policies/Models  June 2017  https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800- 192/fnal  https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-192  Access control systems are among the most  critical of computer security components. Faulty  policies, misconfgurations, or faws in software  implementations can result in serious vulnerabilities.  To formally and precisely capture the security  properties that access control should adhere to,  access control models are usually written, bridging  the gap in abstraction between policies and  mechanisms. Identifying discrepancies between  policy specifcations and their intended function  is crucial because correct implementation and  enforcement of policies by applications is based  on the premise that the policy specifcations are  correct. As a result, policy specifcations represented  by models must undergo rigorous verifcation and  validation through systematic verifcation and  testing to ensure that the policy specifcations  truly encapsulate the desires of the policy authors.  Verifying the conformance of access control policies  and models is a non-trivial and critical task, and one  important aspect of such verifcation is to formally  check the inconsistency and incompleteness of the  model and safety requirements of the policy, because  an access control model and its implementation do  not necessarily explicitly express the policy, which  can also be implicitly embedded by mixing with  direct access constraints or other access control  models.  SP 800-191 (DRAFT)  The NIST Defnition of Fog Computing  August 2017 (public comment period: August 21 –  September 21, 2017)  https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800- 191/draft  Managing the data generated by Internet  of Things (IoT) sensors is one of the biggest  challenges faced when deploying an IoT system.  Traditional cloud-based IoT systems are challenged  by the large scale, heterogeneity, and high latency  witnessed in some cloud ecosystems. One solution  is to decentralize applications, management,  and data analytics into the network itself using a  distributed and federated computing model. This  approach has become known as fog computing.  This document presents a formal defnition of fog  and mist computing and how they relate to cloud- based computing models for IoT. This document  further characterizes important properties and  aspects of fog computing, including service models,  deployment strategies, and provides a baseline of  what fog computing is, and how it may be used.  131  https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800-193/draft https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800-193/draft https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800-192/final https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800-192/final https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-192 https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800-191/draft https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800-191/draft  ITL CYBERSECURITY PUBLICATIONS |  FY 2017  SP 800-190  Application Container Security Guide  September 2017 (also issued as two public drafts  during FY 2017)  https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800- 190/fnal  https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-190  Application container technologies, also  known as containers, are a form of operating  system virtualization combined with application  software packaging. Containers provide a portable,  reusable, and automatable way to package and  run applications. This publication explains the  potential security concerns associated with the use  of containers and provides recommendations for  addressing these concerns.  SP 800-188 (2nd DRAFT)  De-Identifying Government Datasets  December 2016 (public comment period:  December 15-31, 2016)  https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800- 188/draft  De-identifcation is a process that is applied to  a dataset to reduce the risk of linking information  revealed in the dataset to specifc individuals.  Government agencies can use de-identifcation to  reduce the privacy risk associated with collecting,  processing, archiving, distributing or publishing  government data. Previously NIST published NISTIR  8053, De-Identifcation of Personal Information,  which provided a survey of de-identifcation and re- identifcation techniques. This document provides  specifc guidance to government agencies that  wish to use de-identifcation. Before using de- identifcation, agencies should evaluate their goals  in using de-identifcation and the potential risks  that de-identifcation might create. Agencies should  decide upon a de-identifcation release model, such  as publishing de-identifed data, publishing synthetic  data based on identifed data, or providing a query  interface that incorporates de-identifcation of the  identifed data. Agencies can create a Disclosure  Review Board to oversee the process of de- identifcation; they can also adopt a de-identifcation  standard with measurable performance levels.  Several specifc techniques for de-identifcation are  available, including de-identifcation by removing  identifers, transforming quasi-identifers and the  use of formal privacy models. People performing  de-identifcation generally use special-purpose  software tools to perform the data manipulation and  calculate the likely risk of re-identifcation. However,  not all tools that merely mask personal information  provide sufcient functionality for performing  de-identifcation. This document also includes an  extensive list of references, a glossary, and a list  of specifc de-identifcation tools, although the  mention of these tools is only to be used to convey  the range of tools currently available, and is not  intended to imply recommendation or endorsement  by NIST.  SP 800-187 (DRAFT)  Guide to LTE Security  November 2017 (public comment period:  November 21 – December 22, 2017)  https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800- 187/draft  Cellular technology plays an increasingly large  role in society, as it has become the primary portal  to the Internet for a large segment of the population.  One of the main drivers making this change possible  is the deployment of 4th generation (4G) Long  Term Evolution (LTE) cellular technologies. This  document serves as a guide to the fundamentals  of how LTE networks operate and explores the LTE  security architecture. This is followed by an analysis  of the threats posed to LTE networks and supporting  mitigations.

SP 800-184  Guide for Cybersecurity Event Recovery  December 2016  https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800- 184/fnal  https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-184  In light of an increasing number of cybersecurity  events, organizations can improve resilience by  ensuring that their risk management processes  include comprehensive recovery planning.  Identifying and prioritizing organization resources  helps to guide efective plans and realistic test  scenarios. This preparation enables rapid recovery  from incidents when they occur and helps to  minimize the impact on the organization and its  constituents. Additionally, continually improving  recovery planning by learning lessons from past  events, including those of other organizations,  helps to ensure the continuity of important mission  functions. This publication provides tactical and  strategic guidance regarding the planning, playbook  development, testing, and improvement of recovery  planning. It also provides an example scenario that  demonstrates guidance and informative metrics  that may be helpful for improving resilience of  information systems.  SP 800-181  National Initiative for Cybersecurity Education  (NICE) Cybersecurity Workforce Framework  August 2017  https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800- 181/fnal  https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-181  This publication describes the National  Initiative for Cybersecurity Education (NICE)  Cybersecurity Workforce Framework (NICE  Framework), a reference structure that describes  the interdisciplinary nature of the cybersecurity  work.

Recommendations for  email transmission security include Transport  Layer Security (TLS) and associated certifcate  authentication protocols. Recommendations for  email content security include the encryption and  authentication of message content using S/MIME  (Secure/Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions) and  associated certifcate and key distribution protocols.  SP 800-171 Revision 1  Protecting Controlled Unclassifed Information  in Nonfederal Information Systems and  Organizations  December 2016  https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800- 171/rev-1/fnal  https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-171r1  The protection of Controlled Unclassifed  Information (CUI) while residing in nonfederal  information systems and organizations is of  paramount importance to federal agencies and  can directly impact the ability of the Federal  Government to successfully carry out its designated  missions and business operations. This publication  provides federal agencies with recommended  requirements for protecting the confdentiality  of CUI: (i) when the CUI is resident in nonfederal  information systems and organizations; (ii) when the  information systems where the CUI resides are not  used or operated by contractors of federal agencies  or other organizations on behalf of those agencies;  and (iii) where there are no specifc safeguarding  requirements for protecting the confdentiality of  CUI prescribed by the authorizing law, regulation,  or government-wide policy for the CUI category  or subcategory listed in the CUI Registry. The  requirements apply to all components of nonfederal  information systems and organizations that process,  store, or transmit CUI, or provide security protection  for such components. The CUI requirements are  intended for use by federal agencies in contractual  vehicles or other agreements established between  those agencies and nonfederal organizations.  SP 800-160  Systems Security Engineering: Considerations for  a Multidisciplinary Approach in the Engineering of  Trustworthy Secure Systems  November 2016  https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800- 160/fnal  https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-160  With the continuing frequency, intensity, and  adverse consequences of cyber-attacks, disruptions,  hazards, and other threats to federal, state, and  local governments, the military, businesses, and  the critical infrastructure, the need for trustworthy  secure systems has never been more important  to the long-term economic and national security  interests of the United States. Engineering-based  solutions are essential to managing the growing  complexity, dynamicity, and interconnectedness  of today’s systems, as exemplifed by cyber- physical systems and systems-of-systems,  including the Internet of Things. This publication  addresses the engineering-driven perspective  and actions necessary to develop more defensible  and survivable systems, inclusive of the machine,  physical, and human components that compose the  systems and the capabilities and services delivered  by those systems. It starts with and builds upon a  set of well-established International Standards for  systems and software engineering published by 134  https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800-177/rev-1/draft https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800-177/rev-1/draft https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800-171/rev-1/final https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800-171/rev-1/final https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-171r1 https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800-160/final https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800-160/final https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-160  NIST/ITL CYBERSECURITY PROGRAM ANNUAL REPORT 2017  the International Organization for Standardization  (ISO), the International Electrotechnical Commission  (IEC), and the Institute of Electrical and Electronics  Engineers (IEEE) and infuses systems security  engineering methods, practices, and techniques  into those systems and software engineering  activities. The objective is to address security  issues from the protection needs, concerns, and  requirements of perspective stakeholders and to  use established engineering processes to ensure  that such needs, concerns, and requirements are  addressed with appropriate fdelity and rigor, early  and in a sustainable manner throughout the life  cycle of the system.  SP 800-150  Guide to Cyber Threat Information Sharing  October 2016  https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800- 150/fnal  https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-150  Cyber threat information is any information  that can help an organization identify, assess,  monitor, and respond to cyber threats. Cyber threat  information includes indicators of compromise;  tactics, techniques, and procedures used by threat  actors; suggested actions to detect, contain, or  prevent attacks; and the fndings from the analyses  of incidents. Organizations that share cyber  threat information can improve their own security  postures as well as those of other organizations. This  publication provides guidelines for establishing and  participating in cyber threat information sharing  relationships. This guidance helps organizations  establish information sharing goals, identify cyber  threat information sources, scope information- sharing activities, develop rules that control the  publication and distribution of threat information,  engage with existing sharing communities, and  make efective use of threat information in support  of the organization’s overall cybersecurity practices.  SP 800-125A (2nd Draft)  Security Recommendations for Hypervisor  Deployment  September 2017 (public comment period:  September 14 – October 6, 2017)  https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800-  135 125a/draft  The Hypervisor is a piece of software that  provides an abstraction of all physical resources  (such as CPU, Memory, Network and Storage) and  thus enables multiple computing stacks (basically  made of an O/S and application programs, and  optionally a middleware in some instances)  called Virtual Machines (VMs) to be run on a  single physical host. In addition, it may have the  functionality to defne a network within the single  physical host (called a virtual network) to enable  communication among the VMs resident on that  host as well as with physical and virtual machines  outside the host. With all this functionality, the  hypervisor has the responsibility to mediate access  to physical resources, provide run-time isolation  among resident VMs and enable a virtual network  that provides security-preserving communication  fow among the VMs and between the VMs and  the external network. To design a hypervisor with  the core functionality described above, there are  architectural options, with each option presenting  a diferent size of Trusted Computing Base (TCB)  and hence, a diferent degree of ease in providing  the required security assurance. Hence, in providing  security recommendations for the hypervisor, two  diferent approaches have been adopted in this  document – one approach based on architectural  options that provide the ease of security assurance  and the second approach based on confguration  choices that form part of its core administrative  functions such as the management of VMs,  hypervisor host, hypervisor software and virtual  networks.

SP 800-70 Revision 4 (DRAFT)  National Checklist Program for IT Products:  Guidelines for Checklist Users and Developers  August 2017 (public comment period: August 1-30,  2017)  https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800- 70/rev-4/draft  A security confguration checklist is a document  that contains instructions or procedures for  confguring an information technology (IT) product  to an operational environment, for verifying that  the product has been confgured properly, and/  or for identifying unauthorized changes to the  product. Using these checklists can minimize  the attack surface, reduce vulnerabilities, lessen  the impact of successful attacks, and identify  changes that might otherwise go undetected. To  facilitate the development of checklists and to  make checklists more organized and usable, NIST  established the National Checklist Program (NCP).  This publication explains how to use the NCP to  fnd and retrieve checklists, and it also describes the  policies, procedures, and general requirements for  participation in the NCP.  SP 800-67 Revision 2 (DRAFT)  Recommendation for the Triple Data Encryption  Algorithm (TDEA) Block Cipher  July 2017 (public comment period: July 18 –  October 2, 2017)  https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800-67/  rev-2/draft  This publication specifes the Triple Data  Encryption Algorithm (TDEA), including its primary  component cryptographic engine, the Data  Encryption Algorithm (DEA). When implemented in  an SP 800-38-series-compliant mode of operation  and in a FIPS 140-2-compliant cryptographic  module, TDEA may be used by federal organizations  to protect sensitive unclassifed data. Protection of  data during transmission or while in storage may  be necessary to maintain the confdentiality and  integrity of the information represented by the data.  This Recommendation defnes the mathematical  steps required to cryptographically protect data  using TDEA and to subsequently process such  protected data. TDEA is made available for use by  federal agencies within the context of a total security  program consisting of physical security procedures,  good information management practices, and  computer system/network access controls.

The publication describes how to  develop specialized sets of controls, or overlays  that are tailored for specifc types of missions and  business functions, technologies, environments of  operation, and sector-specifc applications. Finally,  the consolidated catalog of controls addresses  security and privacy from a functionality perspective  (i.e., the strength of functions and mechanisms)  and an assurance perspective (i.e., the measure of  confdence in the security or privacy capability).  Addressing both functionality and assurance  ensures that information technology products and  the information systems that rely on those products  are sufciently trustworthy.  SP 800-37 Revision 2 (Discussion Draft)  Risk Management Framework for Information  Systems and Organizations: A System Life Cycle  Approach for Security and Privacy  September 2017  https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800-37/  rev-2/draft  This publication provides guidelines for  applying the Risk Management Framework (RMF)  to information systems and organizations. The  RMF includes a disciplined, structured, and fexible  process for organizational asset valuation; security  and privacy control selection, implementation, and  assessment; system and control authorizations; and  continuous monitoring. It also includes enterprise- level activities to better prepare organizations  to execute the RMF at the system level. The RMF  promotes the concept of near real-time risk  management and ongoing system authorization  through the implementation of continuous  monitoring processes; provides senior leaders  and executives with the necessary information to  make cost-efective, risk management decisions  about the systems supporting their missions and  business functions; and integrates security and  privacy controls into the system development life  cycle. Applying the RMF tasks enterprise-wide  helps to link essential risk management processes  at the system level to risk management processes  at the organization level. In addition, it establishes  responsibility and accountability for the security  and privacy controls deployed within organizational  systems and inherited by those systems. The RMF  incorporates concepts from the Framework for  Improving Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity  that complements the currently established risk  management processes mandated by the Ofce  of Management and Budget and the Federal  Information Security Modernization Act.  SP 800-12 Revision 1  An Introduction to Information Security  June 2017  https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800-12/  rev-1/fnal  https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-12r1  Organizations rely heavily on the use of  information technology (IT) products and services to  run their day-to-day activities. Ensuring the security  of these products and services is of the utmost  importance for the success of the organization.  This publication introduces the information security  principles that organizations may leverage to  understand the information security needs of their  respective systems.  SP 1800 SERIES – CYBERSECURITY  PRACTICE GUIDES  SP 1800-12 (DRAFT)  Derived Personal Identity Verifcation (PIV)  Credentials  September 2017 (public comment period:  September 29 – November 29, 2017)  https://nccoe.nist.gov/projects/building-blocks/  piv-credentials  Federal Information Processing (FIPS) Standards  Publication 201-2, Personal Identity Verifcation  (PIV) of Federal Employees and Contractors,  establishes a standard for a PIV system based on  secure and reliable forms of identity credentials  that are issued by the Federal Government to its  employees and contractors. These credentials are  intended to authenticate individuals who require  access to federally controlled facilities, information  systems, and applications. 138  https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800-37/rev-2/draft https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800-37/rev-2/draft https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800-12/rev-1/final https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800-12/rev-1/final https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-12r1 https://nccoe.nist.gov/projects/building-blocks/piv-credentials https://nccoe.nist.gov/projects/building-blocks/piv-credentials  NIST/ITL CYBERSECURITY PROGRAM ANNUAL REPORT 2017  In 2005, when FIPS 201 was frst published, logical  access was geared toward traditional computing  devices (i.e., desktop and laptop computers), where  the PIV card provides common authentication  mechanisms through integrated smart card readers  across the Federal Government. With the emergence  of computing devices such as tablets, convertible  computers, and, in particular, mobile devices, the  use of PIV cards has proved challenging. Mobile  devices lack the integrated smart card readers  found in laptop and desktop computers and require  separate card readers attached to devices to provide  authentication services. To extend the value of PIV  systems into mobile devices that do not have PIV  Card readers, NIST developed technical guidelines  on the implementation or lifecycle of identity  credentials that are issued by federal departments  and agencies to individuals who possess and prove  control over a valid PIV card.  These NIST guidelines, published in 2014,  describe Derived PIV Credentials (DPCs), which  leverage the identity proofng and vetting results of  current and valid PIV credentials. To demonstrate  the DPC’s guidelines, the NCCoE at NIST built  a security architecture in its laboratory using  commercial technology to manage the lifecycle of  DPCs, demonstrating the process that enables a PIV  Card holder to establish DPCs in a mobile device  that then can be used to allow the PIV Card holder  to access websites that require PIV authentication.  This project resulted in a freely available NIST  Cybersecurity Practice Guide that demonstrates  how an organization can continue to provide two- factor authentication for users with a mobile device  that leverages the strengths of the PIV standard.  Although this project is primarily aimed at the  federal sector’s needs, it is also relevant to mobile  device users with smart card based credentials in  the private sector.  SP 1800-11 (DRAFT)  Data Integrity: Recovering from Ransomware and  Other Destructive Events  September 2017 (public comment period:  September 6 – November 6, 2017)  https://nccoe.nist.gov/projects/building-blocks/  data-integrity  Businesses face a near-constant threat of  destructive malware, ransomware, malicious insider  activities, and even honest mistakes that can alter  or destroy critical data. These data corruption  events could cause a signifcant loss to a company’s  reputation, business operations, and bottom line.  These types of adverse events that ultimately  impact data integrity can compromise critical  corporate information, including emails, employee  records, fnancial records, and customer data. It is  imperative for organizations to recover quickly from  a data integrity attack and trust the accuracy and  precision of the recovered data. The NCCoE at NIST  built a laboratory environment to explore methods  to efectively recover from a data corruption event  in various Information Technology (IT) enterprise  environments. NCCoE also implemented the  auditing and reporting IT system use to support  incident recovery and investigations. This NIST  Cybersecurity Practice Guide demonstrates how  organizations can implement technologies to take  immediate action following a data corruption  event. The example solution outlined in this  guide encourages the efective monitoring and  detection of data corruption in standard, enterprise  components as well as custom applications and  data composed of open-source and commercially  available components.  SP 1800-9 (DRAFT)  Access Rights Management for the Financial  Services Sector  August 2017 (public comment period: August 31 –  October 31, 2017)  https://nccoe.nist.gov/projects/use-cases/access- rights-management  Managing access to resources (data) is  complicated because internal systems multiply  and acquisitions add to the complexity of an  organization’s IT infrastructure. Identity and access  management (IdAM) is the set of technology,  policies, and processes that are used to manage  access to resources. Access rights management  (ARM) is the subset of those technologies, policies,  and processes that manage the rights of individuals  and systems to access resources (data). In other  words, an ARM system enables a company to  give the right person the right access to the right  resources at the right time.  The goal of this project is to demonstrate an  ARM solution that is a standards-based technical  139  https://nccoe.nist.gov/projects/building-blocks/data-integrity https://nccoe.nist.gov/projects/building-blocks/data-integrity https://nccoe.nist.gov/projects/use-cases/access-rights-management https://nccoe.nist.gov/projects/use-cases/access-rights-management  ITL CYBERSECURITY PUBLICATIONS |  FY 2017  approach to coordinating and automating  updates to and improving the security of the  repositories (directories) that maintain the user  access information across an organization. The  coordination improves cybersecurity by ensuring  that user access information is updated accurately  (according to access policies), including disabling  accounts or revoking access privileges as user  resource access needs change. Cybersecurity  is also improved through better monitoring for  unauthorized changes (e.g., privilege escalation).  The system executes user access changes across the  enterprise according to corporate access policies  quickly, simultaneously, and consistently.  The ARM reference design and example  implementation are described in this NIST  Cybersecurity “Access Rights Management” practice  guide. This project resulted from discussions among  NCCoE staf and members of the fnancial services  sector. This NIST Cybersecurity Practice Guide also  describes our collaborative eforts with technology  providers and fnancial services stakeholders to  address the security challenges of ARM. It provides a  modular, open, end-to-end example implementation  that can be tailored to fnancial services companies  of varying sizes and sophistication. The use case  scenario that provides the underlying impetus for  the functionality presented in the guide is based on  normal day-to-day business operations. Although  the reference solution was demonstrated with a  certain suite of products, the guide does not endorse  these specifc products. Instead, it presents the NIST  Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) core functions  and subcategories, as well as the fnancial industry  guidelines that a company’s security personnel can  use to identify similar standards-based products  that can be integrated quickly and cost-efectively  with a company’s existing tools and infrastructure.  Planning for the deployment of the design gives  an organization the opportunity to review and audit  the access control information in their directories  and get a more global, correlated, disambiguated  view of the user access roles and attributes that are  currently in efect.  SP 1800-8 (DRAFT)  Securing Wireless Infusion Pumps in Healthcare  Delivery Organizations  May 2017 (public comment period: May 8 – July 7,  2017)  https://nccoe.nist.gov/projects/use_cases/  medical_devices  Medical devices, such as infusion pumps, were  once standalone instruments that interacted only  with the patient or medical provider. But today’s  medical devices connect to a variety of health  care systems, networks, and other tools within a  healthcare delivery organization (HDO). Connecting  devices to point-of-care medication systems and  electronic health records can improve healthcare  delivery processes; however, increasing the  connectivity capabilities also creates cybersecurity  risks. Potential threats include unauthorized access  to patient health information, changes to prescribed  drug doses, and interference with a pump’s function.  The NCCoE at NIST analyzed risk factors in  and around the infusion pump ecosystem using a  questionnaire-based risk assessment to develop  an example implementation that demonstrates  how HDOs can use standards-based, commercially  available cybersecurity technologies to better  protect the infusion pump ecosystem, including  patient information and drug library dosing limits.  This practice guide will help HDOs implement  current cybersecurity standards and best practices  to reduce their cybersecurity risk, while maintaining  the performance and usability of wireless infusion  pumps.

It ofers a technical approach  to meeting the challenge, and also incorporates  a business-value mind-set by identifying the  strategic considerations involved in implementing  new technologies. The guide provides a modular,  140  https://nccoe.nist.gov/projects/use_cases/medical_devices https://nccoe.nist.gov/projects/use_cases/medical_devices https://nccoe.nist.gov/projects/use_cases/situational_awareness https://nccoe.nist.gov/projects/use_cases/situational_awareness  NIST/ITL CYBERSECURITY PROGRAM ANNUAL REPORT 2017  end-to-end example solution that can be tailored  and implemented by energy providers of varying  sizes and sophistication. It shows energy providers  how we met the challenge using open source and  commercially available tools and technologies that  are consistent with cybersecurity standards. The use  case is based on an everyday operational business  scenario that provides the underlying impetus for  the functionality presented in the guide. Test cases  were defned with industry participation to provide  multiple examples of the capabilities necessary to  provide situational awareness.

The project includes  reliable  authentication of mail servers, digitally  signing and encrypting email, and binding  cryptographic key certifcates to sources and  servers. The example solutions and architectures  presented are based upon standards-based and  commercially available products. The example  solutions presented can be used by any organization  implementing Domain Name System-based  electronic mail security.  SP 1800-3 (2nd DRAFT)  Attribute Based Access Control  September 2017 (public comment period:  September 20 – October 20, 2017)  https://nccoe.nist.gov/projects/building-blocks/  attribute-based-access-control  Enterprises rely upon strong access control  mechanisms to ensure that corporate resources  (e.g., applications, networks, systems, and data) are  not exposed to anyone other than an authorized  user. As business requirements change, enterprises  need highly fexible access control mechanisms that  can adapt. The application of attribute based policy  defnitions enables enterprises to accommodate a  diverse set of business cases. This NCCoE practice  guide details a collaborative efort between the  NCCoE and technology providers to demonstrate  a standards-based approach to Attribute Based  Access Control (ABAC). This guide discusses  potential security risks facing organizations,  benefts that may result from the implementation of  an ABAC system, and the approach that the NCCoE  took in developing a reference architecture and  build. It includes a discussion of major architecture  design considerations, an explanation of security  characteristics achieved by the reference design,  and a mapping of the security characteristics to  applicable standards and security control families.  For parties interested in adopting all or part of the  NCCoE reference architecture, this guide includes a  detailed description of the installation, confguration,  and integration of all components.

NISTIR 8179 (DRAFT)  Criticality Analysis Process Model: Prioritizing  Systems and Components  July 2017 (public comment period: July 10 – August  18, 2017)  https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/nistir/8179/  draft  In the modern world where complex systems  and systems-of-systems are integral to the  functioning of society and businesses, it is  increasingly important to be able to understand and  manage risks that these systems and components  may present to the missions that they support.  However, in the world of fnite resources, it is not  possible to apply equal protection to all assets. This  publication describes a comprehensive Criticality  Analysis Process Model – a structured method of  prioritizing programs, systems, and components  based on their importance to the goals of an  organization and the impact that their inadequate  operation or loss may present to those goals. A  criticality analysis can help organizations identify  and better understand the systems, subsystems,  components and subcomponents that are most  essential to their operations and the environment in  which they operate. That understanding facilitates  better decision making related to the management  of an organization’s information assets, including  information security risk management, project  management, acquisition, maintenance, and  upgrade decisions. The Model is structured to  logically follow how organizations design and  implement projects and systems, can be used as  a component of a holistic and comprehensive risk  management approach that considers all risks, and  can be used with a variety of risk management  standards and guidelines.  142  https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/nistir/8192/final https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/nistir/8192/final https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.IR.8192 https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/nistir/8183/final https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/nistir/8183/final https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.IR.8183 https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/nistir/8179/draft https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/nistir/8179/draft  NIST/ITL CYBERSECURITY PROGRAM ANNUAL REPORT 2017  NISTIR 8176 (DRAFT)  Security Assurance Challenges for Container  Deployment  August 2017 (public comment period: August 1-25,  2017)  https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/nistir/8176/  draft  Application containers are slowly being adopted  in enterprise IT infrastructures. Security guidelines  and countermeasures have been proposed to  address the security concerns associated with the  deployment of application container platforms. To  assess the efectiveness of the security solutions  implemented based on these recommendations,  it is necessary to analyze the solutions and outline  the security assurance requirements they must  satisfy to meet their intended objectives. This is  the contribution of this document. The focus is on  application containers on a Linux platform.  NISTIR 8170 (DRAFT)  The Cybersecurity Framework: Implementation  Guidance for Federal Agencies  May 2017 (public comment period: May 12 – June  30, 2017)  https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/nistir/8170/  draft  This publication assists federal agencies in  strengthening their cybersecurity risk management  by helping them to determine an appropriate  implementation of the Framework for Improving  Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity (known as the  Cybersecurity Framework). Federal agencies can  use the Cybersecurity Framework to complement  the existing suite of NIST security and privacy risk  management standards, guidelines, and practices  developed in response to the Federal Information  Security Management Act, as amended (FISMA). The  relationship between the Cybersecurity Framework  and the National Institute of Standards and  Technology (NIST) Risk Management Framework  are discussed in eight use cases.  NISTIR 8165  Impact of Code Complexity on Software Analysis  February 2017  https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/nistir/8165/  fnal  https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/ir/2017/NIST.  IR.8165.pdf  The Software Assurance Metrics and Tool  Evaluation (SAMATE) team studied thousands of  warnings from static analyzers. Tools have difculty  distinguishing between the absence of a weakness  and the presence of a weakness that is buried in  otherwise-irrelevant code elements. This paper  presents classes of these code elements, which we  call “code complexities.”  These code elements have been present in  software assurance testing regimens as part of the  generation strategy for test cases when evaluating  static analyzers. The benefts of using code  complexity include the development of coding  guidelines, boosting the diversifcation of the test  cases.  NISTIR 8151  Dramatically Reducing Software Vulnerabilities:  Report to the White House Ofce of Science and  Technology Policy  November 2016  https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/nistir/8151/  fnal  https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.IR.8151  The call for a dramatic reduction in software  vulnerability is heard from multiple sources, recently  from the February 2016 Federal Cybersecurity  Research and Development Strategic Plan. This  plan starts by describing well-known risks; current  systems perform increasingly vital tasks and are  widely known to possess vulnerabilities. These  vulnerabilities are often not easy to discover and  are difcult to correct. Cybersecurity has not  kept pace, and the pace that is needed is rapidly  accelerating. The goal of this report is to present a  list of specifc technical approaches that have the  potential to make a dramatic diference in reducing  vulnerabilities – by stopping them before they  occur, by fnding them before they are exploited or  by reducing their impact.

SP 800-22 and SP 800-90 (A, B,  and C) discuss tests and methods leveraging both  Shannon and min entropies. Shannon and min  entropies represent two particular cases of Renyi  entropy, which is a more general, one-parameter  entropy model. Renyi entropy insightfully unifes  Hartley, Shannon, collision, and min entropies and  belongs to the class of one parameter entropy  models, such as entropies named after Havrda- Charvat-Daroczy, Tsallis, Abe, and Kaniadakis. Renyi  entropy, along with the other members of the one- parameter entropy models class, can be viewed  as a case of the Sharma-Mittal entropy, which is  a bi-parametric generalized entropy model. This  NISTIR focuses on using Renyi and Tsallis entropy  and divergence models to analyze similarities and  diferences between the probability distributions  of interest. The report introduces extensions  for the traditional uniformity identifcation and  measurement techniques that were proposed in SP  800-22 and SP 800-90.  NISTIR 8136  An Overview of Mobile Application Vetting  Services for Public Safety  January 2017  https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/nistir/8136/  fnal  https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.IR.8136  The Middle Class Tax Relief Act of 2012  mandated the creation of the frst nationwide,  high-speed communications network dedicated  for public safety. The law instantiated a new federal  entity, the Federal Responder Network Authority  (FirstNet), to build, maintain, and operate a new  Long Term Evolution (LTE) network. This network  has the potential to equip frst responders with  a modern array of network devices. Mobile  applications are  an important resource that will be  utilized by this network. However, current mobile  application developers may not be aware of the  unique needs and requirements that must be met  for operation on FirstNet’s network. It would beneft  the public safety community to leverage the mobile  application vetting services and infrastructures  that already exist. These services currently target  the general public and enterprise markets. This  document is intended to be an overview of existing  mobile application vetting services, the features  these services provide and how they relate to  public safety’s needs. It is also meant to aid public  safety organizations when choosing which mobile  application vetting services are used to evaluate  relevant mobile applications.  NISTIR 8114  Report on Lightweight Cryptography  March 2017  https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/nistir/8114/  fnal  https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.IR.8114  The current NIST-approved cryptographic  standards were designed to perform well on  general-purpose computers. In recent years,  there has been an increased deployment of small  computing devices that have limited resources with  which to implement cryptography. When current  NIST-approved algorithms can be engineered  to ft into the limited resources of constrained  environments, their performance may not be  acceptable. For these reasons, NIST started a  lightweight cryptography project that was tasked  with learning more about the issues and developing  a strategy for the standardization of lightweight  cryptographic algorithms. This report provides an  overview of the lightweight cryptography project at  NIST, and describes plans for the standardization of  lightweight cryptographic algorithms.  NISTIR 8062  An Introduction to Privacy Engineering and Risk  Management in Federal Systems  January 2017  https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/  nistir/8062/fnal  https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.IR.8062  This document provides an introduction to  the concepts of privacy engineering and risk  management for federal systems. These concepts  establish the basis for a common vocabulary to  facilitate a better understanding and communication  of privacy risks within federal systems and the  efective implementation of privacy principles. This  publication introduces two key components to  support the application of privacy engineering and  risk management: privacy engineering objectives  and a privacy risk model.  144  https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/nistir/8136/final https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/nistir/8136/final https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.IR.8136 https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/nistir/8114/final https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/nistir/8114/final https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.IR.8114 https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/nistir/8062/final https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/nistir/8062/final https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.IR.8062  NIST/ITL CYBERSECURITY PROGRAM ANNUAL REPORT 2017  NISTIR 8011 Volume 1  Automation Support for Security Control  Assessments: Overview  June 2017  https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/nistir/8011/  vol-1/fnal  https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.IR.8011-1  This volume introduces concepts to support  the automated assessment of most of the security  controls in SP 800-53. Referencing SP 800-53A, the  controls are divided into more granular parts (called  determination statements) to be assessed. The  parts of the control assessed by each determination  statement are called control items. The control items  are then grouped into the appropriate security  capabilities. As suggested by SP 800-53 Revision  4, security capabilities are groups of controls that  support a common purpose. For efective automated  assessment, testable defect checks are defned that  bridge the determination statements to the broader  security capabilities to be achieved and to the SP  800-53 security control items themselves. The defect  checks correspond to security sub-capabilities—  called sub-capabilities because each is part of a  larger capability. Capabilities and sub-capabilities  are both designed with the purpose of addressing  a series of attack steps. Automated assessments (in  the form of defect checks) are performed using the  test assessment method defned in SP 800-53A by  comparing a desired and actual state (or behavior).  NISTIR 8011 Volume 2  Automation Support for Security Control  Assessments: Hardware Asset Management  June 2017  https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/nistir/8011/  vol-2/fnal  https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.IR.8011-2  The NISTIR 8011 volumes focus on each  individual information security capability, adding  tangible detail to the more general overview given  in NISTIR 8011 Volume 1, and providing a template  for transition to a detailed, NIST standards- compliant automated assessment. This document,  Volume 2 of NISTIR 8011, addresses the Hardware  Asset Management (HWAM) information security  capability. The focus of the HWAM capability is to  manage the risks created by unmanaged and/or  unauthorized devices on a network. Unmanaged  devices are targets that attackers can use to gain  and more easily maintain a persistent platform from  which to attack the rest of the network.

PROJECT DESCRIPTIONS (NCCOE)  Capabilities Assessment for Securing  Manufacturing Industrial Control Systems:  Cybersecurity for Manufacturing  March 2017  https://nccoe.nist.gov/projects/use-cases/  capabilities-assessment-securing-manufacturing- industrial-control-systems  Industrial Control Systems (ICS) monitor  and control physical processes in many diferent  industries and sectors. Cyber attacks against ICS  devices present a real threat to organizations that  employ ICS to monitor and control manufacturing  processes. The NIST Engineering Laboratory (EL), in  conjunction with the National Cybersecurity Center  of Excellence, will produce a series of example  solutions demonstrating four cybersecurity  capabilities for manufacturing organizations.  Each example solution will highlight an individual  capability: Behavioral Anomaly Detection, ICS  Application Whitelisting, Malware Detection and  Mitigation, and ICS Data Integrity.  This capabilities assessment document is  part one of a four-part series and addresses only  behavioral anomaly detection capabilities. With  these capabilities in place, manufacturers may fnd it  easier to detect anomalous conditions, control what  programs and applications are executed in their  operating environments, mitigate malware attacks,  and ensure the integrity of critical operational  data. For each of the four capabilities listed above,  the NIST EL and the NCCoE will map the security  characteristics to the NIST Cybersecurity Framework  (CSF), which will provide standards-based security  controls for manufacturers. In addition, the EL and  the NCCoE will implement each of the capabilities  in two distinct but related lab settings: a robotics- based manufacturing enclave and a process control  enclave that resembles what is being used by  chemical manufacturing industries. This project  will result in a publicly available NIST Cybersecurity  Practice Guide, a detailed implementation guide  of the practical steps needed to implement the  cybersecurity example solution that addresses this  challenge.

However, these advantages can be  limited if unnecessary or complex authentication  requirements stand in the way of an ofcial  providing emergency services, especially when any  delay – even seconds – is a matter of containing  or exacerbating an emergency situation. The vast  diversity of public safety personnel, missions, and  operational environments magnifes the need for a  nimble authentication solution for public safety.  This project will explore various multifactor  authenticators currently in use by the public safety  community, or those potentially ofered in the future  as their next generation networks are brought  online. The efort will not only build an interoperable  solution that can accept various authenticators to  speed access to online systems while maintaining an  appropriate amount of security, but will also focus on  delivering single sign-on (SSO) capabilities to both  native and web/browser-based applications. It is not  enough to have an authenticator that is easy to use;  this project sets out to identify technical options for  the public safety community to consider deploying  to ensure that individuals in the feld are not kept  from meeting their mission goals by unnecessary  authentication prompts. This project will result in a  freely available NIST Cybersecurity Practice Guide,  detailing the technical decisions, trade-ofs, lessons  learned, and implementation instructions based on  market-dominant standards, such that public safety  organizations can accelerate the deployment of a  range of mobile authentication and SSO services to  their population of users.  Secure Inter-Domain Routing—Part 1: Route Hijacks  July 6, 2017  https://nccoe.nist.gov/projects/building-blocks/  secure-inter-domain-routing  Since the creation of the Internet, the Border  Gateway Protocol (BGP) has been the default  routing protocol to route trafc among organizations  (Internet Service Providers (ISPs) and Autonomous  Systems (ASes)). While the BGP protocol performs  adequately in identifying viable paths that  refect local routing policies and preferences to  destinations, the lack of built-in security allows  the protocol to be exploited. As a result, attacks  against Internet routing functions are a signifcant  and systemic threat to Internet-based information  systems. The consequences of these attacks can: (1)  deny access to Internet services; (2) detour Internet  trafc to permit eavesdropping and to facilitate on- path attacks on endpoints (sites); (3) misdeliver  Internet network trafc to malicious endpoints;  (4) undermine IP address-based reputation and  fltering systems; and (5) cause routing instability in  the Internet.  To improve the security of inter-domain routing  trafc exchange, NIST has begun the development of  a Special Publication (SP 800-189 – in preparation)  that provides security recommendations for  the use of inter-domain protocols and routing  technologies. These recommendations aim to  protect the integrity of Internet trafc exchange.  Implementing BGP Route Origin Validation (ROV)  based upon the Resource Public Key Infrastructure  (RPKI) can mitigate  accidental  and malicious  attacks associated with route hijacking. The NCCoE  understands that organizations and individuals  have Internet performance expectations and  requirements to protect against malicious cyber  attacks. It is expected that eventual wide-scale  deployment of RPKI-based ROV will signifcantly  enhance the overall security and robustness of  the Internet. This project will result in a NIST  Cybersecurity Practice Guide—a publicly available  description of the solution and practical steps  needed to implement practices that efectively  demonstrate the security and functionality of all  components of ROV.  Securing Property Management Systems:  Cybersecurity for the Hospitality Sector (DRAFT)  April 28, 2017  https://nccoe.nist.gov/projects/use_cases/  securing-property-management-systems  Hospitality organizations rely on Property  Management Systems (PMS) for daily tasks,  planning, and record keeping. As the operations  hub, the PMS interfaces with several services and  components within a hotel’s IT system, such as Point- of-Sale (POS) systems, door locks, Wi-Fi networks,  and other guest service applications. Adding to  148  https://nccoe.nist.gov/projects/building-blocks/secure-inter-domain-routing https://nccoe.nist.gov/projects/building-blocks/secure-inter-domain-routing https://nccoe.nist.gov/projects/use_cases/securing-property-management-systems https://nccoe.nist.gov/projects/use_cases/securing-property-management-systems  NIST/ITL CYBERSECURITY PROGRAM ANNUAL REPORT 2017  the complexity of connections, external business  partners’ components and services are also typically  connected to the PMS, such as on-premise spas  or restaurants, online travel agents, and customer  relationship management partners or applications  (on-premise or cloud-based). The numerous  connections to, and users of the PMS, could provide  a broader surface for attack by malicious actors. The  draft describes methods to improve the security of  the PMS, and how these methods can help protect  the business from network intrusions that might  lead to data breaches and fraud.  Based on industry research and in collaboration  with hospitality industry stakeholders, the NCCoE  is starting a project that aims to help hospitality  organizations implement stronger security measures  within and around the PMS, with a focus on the  POS system through network segmentation, point- to-point encryption, data tokenization, multifactor  authentication for remote and partner access, network  and user behavior analytics, and business-only usage  restrictions. In collaboration with the hospitality  business community and technology vendors who  implement standards that improve cybersecurity, the  NCCoE will explore methods to strengthen the security  of the PMS and its connections and will develop an  example implementation composed of open-source  and commercially available components. This project  will produce a NIST Cybersecurity Practice Guide—a  freely available description of the solution and  practical steps needed to efectively secure the PMS  and its many connections within the hotel IT system.  OTHER NIST PUBLICATIONS  Baldrige Cybersecurity Excellence Builder: Key  questions for improving your organization’s  cybersecurity performance, v1.0  April 2017  https://www.nist.gov/baldrige/products-services/  baldrige-cybersecurity-initiative  The Baldrige Cybersecurity Excellence Builder  is a voluntary self-assessment tool that enables  organizations to better understand the efectiveness  of their cybersecurity risk management eforts.

To better protect  these systems, the President issued Executive  Order 13636, Improving Critical Infrastructure 149  https://www.nist.gov/baldrige/products-services/baldrige-cybersecurity-initiative https://www.nist.gov/baldrige/products-services/baldrige-cybersecurity-initiative https://www.nist.gov/file/344211  ITL CYBERSECURITY PUBLICATIONS |  FY 2017  Cybersecurity, on February 12, 2013. The Executive  Order established that “[i]t is the Policy of the  United States to enhance the security and resilience  of the nation’s critical infrastructure and to maintain  a cyber environment that encourages efciency,  innovation, and economic prosperity while  promoting safety, security, business confdentiality,  privacy, and civil liberties.” In enacting this policy,  the Executive Order calls for the development of  a voluntary risk-based Cybersecurity Framework  - a set of industry standards and best practices  to help organizations manage cybersecurity  risks. The resulting Framework, created through  collaboration between government and the private  sector, uses a common language to address and  manage cybersecurity risk in a cost-efective way,  based on business needs without placing additional  regulatory requirements on businesses. The  Framework enables organizations—regardless of  size, degree of cybersecurity risk, or cybersecurity  sophistication—to apply the principles and the best  risk management practices to improve the security  and resilience of the critical infrastructure. The  Framework provides organization and structure to  today’s multiple approaches to cybersecurity by  assembling standards, guidelines, and practices that  are working efectively in industry today. Moreover,  because it references globally recognized standards  for cybersecurity, the Framework can also be  used by organizations located outside the United  States and can serve as a model for international  cooperation on strengthening critical infrastructure  cybersecurity.

Cryptology ePrint  Archive, Report 2017/563, June 7, 2017, 26 pp.  http://ia.cr/2017/563  The Boyen-Li signature scheme [Asiacrypt’16]  is a major theoretical breakthrough. Via a clever  homomorphic evaluation of a pseudorandom  function over their verifcation key, they achieve  a reduction loss in security that is linear in the  underlying security parameter and entirely  independent of the number of message queries  made, while still maintaining short signatures  (consisting of a single short lattice vector). All  previous schemes with such an independent  reduction loss in security required a linear number  of such lattice vectors, and even in the classical  world, the only schemes achieving short signatures  relied on non-standard assumptions.  We improve on their result, providing a  verifcation key that is smaller by a linear factor, a  signifcantly tighter reduction with only a constant  loss, and signing and verifcation algorithms that  could plausibly run in about 1 second. Our main idea  is to change the scheme in a manner that allows us  to replace the pseudorandom function evaluation  with an evaluation of a much more efcient weak  pseudorandom function.

We are optimistic that this  approach will make some of the highly complex  proofs in quantum cryptography more accessible,  facilitate the discovery of new proofs, and enable  automated proof verifcation.

Glasnik Matematicki 52(1), pp. 1-10  (2017).  https://web.math.pmf.unizg.hr/glasnik/vol_52/  no1_01.html  In this paper, we look at long geometric  progressions on diferent models of elliptic curves,  namely Weierstrass curves, Edwards and twisted  Edwards curves, Huf curves and general quartics  curves. By a geometric progression on an elliptic  curve, we mean the existence of rational points on  the curve whose x-coordinates (or y-coordinates)  are in geometric progression. We fnd infnite  families of twisted Edwards curves and Huf  curves with geometric progressions of length 5, an  infnite family of Weierstrass curves with 8-term  progressions, as well as infnite families of quartic  curves containing 10-term geometric progressions.

In this  work, we establish a correspondence between  Heron quadrilaterals and a family of elliptic curves  of the form y2 = x3 + ax2 − n2x. This correspondence  generalizes the notions of Goins and Maddox who  established a similar connection between Heron  triangles and elliptic curves. We further study this  family of elliptic curves, looking at their torsion  groups and ranks. We also explore their connection  with the a=0 case of congruent numbers.

Innovations in Systems and Software  Engineering 12(4), pp. 249-261 (December 2016).  https://doi.org/10.1007/s11334-015-0266-2  A key issue in testing is how many tests are  needed for a required level of coverage or fault  detection. Estimates are often based on error rates  in initial testing, or on code coverage. For example,  tests may be run until a desired level of statement  or branch coverage is achieved. Combinatorial  methods present an opportunity for a diferent  approach to estimating the required test-set size  using characteristics of the test set. This paper  describes methods for estimating the coverage of,  and ability to detect, t-way interaction faults of a  test set, based on a covering array. We also develop  a connection between (static) combinatorial  coverage and (dynamic) code coverage, such that  if a specifc condition is satisfed, 100 % branch  coverage is assured. Using these results, we propose  practical recommendations for using combinatorial  coverage in specifying test requirements, and for  improving estimates of the fault detection capacity  of a test set.

IEEE Software 33(6), pp. 16-19 (November/December  2016).  https://doi.org/10.1109/MS.2016.136  As new and exciting healthcare applications  arise that use smart technologies, the Internet of  Things, data analytics, and other technologies,  a critical problem is emerging: the potential loss  of caring. Although these exciting technologies  have improved patient care by allowing for better  assessment, surveillance, and treatment, their use  can disassociate the caregiver from the patient,  essentially removing the “care” from healthcare. So,  you can view caring as an undiscovered -ility that  ranks at least as important as other well-known  -ilities in healthcare systems.  P. Laplante, M. Kassab, N. Laplante and J. Voas.

IEEE Systems Journal 99, pp. 1-8 (February  22, 2017).  https://doi.org/10.1109/JSYST.2017.2662602  The nature of healthcare and the computational  and physical technologies and constraints present  a number of challenges to systems designers and  implementers. In spite of the challenges, there is  a signifcant market for systems and products to  support caregivers in their tasks as the number of  people needing assistance grows substantially. In  this paper, we present a structured approach for  describing the Internet of Things (IoT) for healthcare  systems. We illustrate the approach for three use  cases and discuss relevant quality issues that arise  -  in particular, the need to consider caring as a  requirement.  P. Mell , J. Shook, R. Harang and S.

This has always been  the goal in the design of access control mechanisms,  but individual approaches can be inadequate.  Approaches that instantiate multiple methods  simultaneously have been shown to restrict access 152  https://doi.org/10.1007/s11334-015-0266-2 https://doi.org/10.1109/MS.2016.136 https://doi.org/10.1109/JSYST.2017.2662602 https://doi.org/10.22667/JOWUA.2017.03.31.004 http://math.colgate.edu/~integers/vol16.html  NIST/ITL CYBERSECURITY PROGRAM ANNUAL REPORT 2017                  with more precision. However, those approaches  have had limited scalability (resulting in exponential  calculations in some cases).  In this work, we provide an implementation of the  Next Generation Access Control (NGAC) standard  from the American National Standards Institute  (ANSI) and demonstrate that it scales. The existing  publicly available reference implementations all  use cubic algorithms for policy decisions, and  thus, NGAC was widely viewed as not scalable.  Our approach provides an easy to understand  graph algorithm that performs policy decisions in  linear time at the worst. However, in practice, the  algorithm runs considerably faster. We also provide  a default linear-time mechanism to visualize and  review user access rights for an ensemble of access  control mechanisms. Our visualization appears to  be a simple fle directory hierarchy, but in reality is  an automatically generated structure abstracted  from the underlying access control graph that  works with any set of simultaneously instantiated  access control policies. It also provides an implicit  mechanism for symbolic linking that provides a  powerful access capability. Our work has thus lead  to the frst efcient implementation of NGAC while  enabling user privilege review through a novel  visualization approach.  C. Miller and Y. Shi. Randomness in Nonlocal  Games Between Mistrustful Players. Quantum  Information & Computation 17(7&8), pp. 595-610  (June 2017).  https://doi.org/10.26421/QIC17.7-8  If two quantum players at a nonlocal game  $G$ achieve a superclassical score, then their  measurement outcomes must be at least partially  random from the perspective of any third player.  This is the basis for device-independent quantum  cryptography. In this paper we address a related  question: does a superclassical score at $G$  guarantee that one player has created randomness  from the perspective of the other player? We show  that for complete-support games, the answer is  yes; even if the second player is given the frst  player’s input at the conclusion of the game, he  cannot perfectly recover her output. Thus, some  amount of local randomness (i.e., randomness  possessed by only one player) is always obtained  when randomness is certifed from nonlocal games  with quantum strategies. This is in contrast to non- signaling game strategies, which may produce  global randomness without any local randomness.  We discuss potential implications for cryptographic  protocols between mistrustful parties.  D. Moody  and A.A. Ciss. Arithmetic Progressions  on Conics.

We revisit arithmetic progressions on  the unit circle, constructing 3-term progressions of  points in the frst quadrant containing an arbitrary  rational point on the unit circle. We also provide  infnite families of 3-term progressions on the unit  hyperbola, as well as conics ax2 + cy2 = 1 containing  arithmetic progressions as long as 8 terms.  D. Simos, D.R. Kuhn, A.

At the forefront of that was software metrics, along  with the corresponding software testing techniques  and tools and process improvement schemes that  relied on the software metrics.

Many  companies and organizations have made the  transition from traditional data centers to the  cloud due to its fexibility and lower cost. However,  traditional data centers are still being relied upon  by those who are less certain about the security of  cloud computing. This problem is highlighted by the  fact that there only exist limited eforts on threat  modeling for cloud data centers. In this paper, we  conduct comprehensive threat modeling exercises  based on two representative cloud infrastructures  using several popular threat modeling methods,  including attack surface, attack trees, attack graphs,  and security metrics based on attack trees and attack  graphs, respectively. Those threat modeling eforts  provide cloud providers with practical lessons and  the means toward better evaluating, understanding,  and improving their cloud infrastructures. Our  results may also improve confdence in potential  cloud tenants by providing them a clearer picture  about potential threats in cloud infrastructures and  corresponding solutions.  D. Borbor, L.

In Lecture Notes in Computer Science 10359, DBSec  2017: Data and Applications Security and Privacy XXXI,  pp. 509-528.  https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-61176-1_28  The administrators of a mission critical  network usually have to worry about non- traditional threats, e.g., how to live with known, but  unpatchable vulnerabilities, and how to improve the  network’s resilience against potentially unknown  vulnerabilities. To this end, network hardening is a  well-known preventive security solution that aims  to improve network security by taking proactive  actions, namely, hardening options. However,  most existing network hardening approaches rely  on a single hardening option, such as disabling  unnecessary services, which becomes less efective  when it comes to dealing with unknown and  unpatchable vulnerabilities. A heterogeneous  approach is lacking that can combine diferent  hardening options in an optimal way to deal with  both unknown and unpatchable vulnerabilities.  In this paper, we propose such an approach by  unifying multiple hardening options, such as  frewall rule modifcation, disabling services, service  diversifcation, and access control, under the same  model. We then apply security metrics designed  for evaluating network resilience against unknown  and unpatchable vulnerabilities, and consequently  154  https://doi.org/10.1109/MC.2017.144 https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-51966-1_20 https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-61176-1_28  NIST/ITL CYBERSECURITY PROGRAM ANNUAL REPORT 2017  derive optimal hardening solutions that maximize  security under given cost constraints.

NDAC  imposes access control at the data level, eliminating  the need for implementing and managing access  control in applications and/or through the use of  proprietary RDBMS mechanisms. Consequently,  the same policies can protect multiple databases  from queries sent from multiple applications.  Furthermore, NDAC not only provides control down  to the feld level, but to varying felds of select rows.  NDAC is unique in achieving this granularity of  control without the use and coordination of multiple  protection mechanisms. Operationally, users issue  wide sweeping queries, and NDAC allows access  to the optimal amount of data permissible for the  user. The method includes an Access Manager for  trapping and enforcing policy over the SQL queries  issued by applications, as well as a Translator for  converting SQL statements to NGAC inputs and  converting NGAC authorization responses to either  an access deny or one or more permitted SQL  statements.

This improves the 3n-o(n) bound of  Norbert Blum (1984). The proof is based on the gate  elimination technique extended with the following  three ideas. We generalize the computational model  by allowing circuits to contain cycles; this in turn  allows us to perform afne substitutions. We use a  carefully chosen circuit complexity measure to track  the progress of the gate elimination process. Finally,  we use quadratic substitutions that may be viewed  as delayed afne substitutions.  Y. Hanatani, N. Ogura, Y. Ohba, L. Chen and S.  Das.

SSR 2016, pp. 227- 243.  https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-49100-4_10  Controlling a large number of devices such as  sensors and smart end points is always a challenge  where scalability and security are indispensable.  This is even more important when it comes to  periodic confguration updates to a large number  of such devices belonging to one or more groups.  One solution could be to take a group of devices  as a unit of control and then manage them through  a group communication mechanism. An obvious  challenge to this approach is how to create such  groups dynamically and manage them securely.  Moreover, there need to be mechanisms in place by  which members of the group can be removed and  added dynamically.  In this paper, we propose a technique that has  been recently standardized in IEEE 802.21 (IEEE Std  802.21d™-2015) with the objective of providing a  standard-based solution to the above challenges.  The approach relies on the Logical Key Hierarchy  (LKH) based key distribution mechanism, but  optimizes the number of encryption and decryption  operations by using a “Complete Subtree”. It  leverages the IEEE 802.21 framework, services, and  protocol for communication and management, and  provides a scalable and secure way to manage (e.g.,  add and remove) devices from one or more groups.  We describe the group key distribution protocol 155  https://doi.org/10.1145/3041048.3041050 https://doi.org/10.1109/FOCS.2016.19 https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-49100-4_10  ITL CYBERSECURITY PUBLICATIONS |  FY 2017  in detail and provide a security analysis of the  scheme along with some performance results from  a prototype implementation.

In Lecture  Notes in Computer Science 10128, Foundations and  Practice of Security (Revised Selected Papers), pp.  36-47.  https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-51966-1_3  Network intrusion detection is broadly divided  into signature and anomaly detection. The former  identifes patterns associated with known attacks,  and the latter attempts to learn a “normal” pattern  of activity and provides an alert when behaviors  outside of those norms is detected. The n-gram  methodology has arguably been the most successful  technique for network anomaly detection. In this  work, we discovered that when training data is  sanitized, n-gram anomaly detection is not primarily  anomaly detection, as it receives the majority of  its performance from an implicit non-anomaly  subsystem that neither uses typical signatures nor is  anomaly-based (though it is closely related to both).  We fnd that for our data, these “micro-signatures”  provide the vast majority of the detection capability.  This fnding changes how we understand and  approach n-gram based ‘anomaly’ detection. By  understanding the foundational principles upon  which it operates, we can then better explore how  to optimally improve it.  J. Jones, T. Khan, K. Laskey, A. Nelson, M. Laamanen  and D. White.

Proceedings of the  11th Annual Conference on Digital Forensics, Security  and Law (ADFSL), Daytona Beach, Florida, May 24-26,  2017, pp. 113-130.  http://commons.erau.edu/adfsl/2016/wednesday/3/  In this paper, we present an approach and  experimental results to suggest the past presence  of an application after the application has been  uninstalled and the system has remained in use.  Current techniques rely on the recovery of intact  artifacts and traces, e.g., whole fles, Windows  Registry entries, or log fle entries, while our  approach requires no intact artifact recovery and  leverages trace evidence in the form of residual  partial fles. In the case of recently uninstalled  applications or an instrumented infrastructure,  artifacts and traces may be intact and complete.  In most cases, however, digital artifacts and traces  are altered, destroyed, and disassociated over time,  due to normal system operation and deliberate  obfuscation activity. As a result, analysts are often  presented with partial and incomplete artifacts and  traces from which defensible conclusions must be  drawn.  In this work, we match the sectors from a hard  disk of interest to a previously constructed catalog  of full fles captured while various applications  were installed, used, and uninstalled. The sectors  composing the fles in the catalog are not necessarily  unique to each fle or application, so we use an  inverse frequency-weighting scheme to compute  the inferential value of matched sectors. Similarly,  we compute the fraction of full fles associated  with each application that is matched, where each  fle with a sector match is weighted by the fraction  of total catalog sectors matched for that fle. We  compared results using both the sector-weighted  and fle-weighted values for known ground truth- test images and fnal-snapshot images from the  M57 Patents Scenario data set. The fle-weighted  measure was slightly more accurate than the  sector-weighted measure, although both identifed  all of the uninstalled applications in the test images  and a high percentage of installed and uninstalled  applications in the M57 data set, with minimal false  positives for both sets.  The key contribution of our work is the  suggestion of uninstalled applications through  weighted measurement of residual fle fragments.  Our experimental results indicate that past  application activity can be reliably indicated even  after an application has been uninstalled, and the  host system has been rebooted and used. The rapid  and reliable indication of previously uninstalled  applications is useful for cyber defense, law  enforcement, and intelligence operations.  L. Khati, N. Mouha and D. Vergnaud.

In the context of FDE, it is assumed  that there is no space to store additional data, such  as an IV (Initialization Vector) or a MAC (Message  Authentication Code) value. We formally defne  the security notions in this model against chosen- plaintext and chosen-ciphertext attacks. Then, we  classify various FDE modes of operation according  to their security in this setting, in the presence of  various restrictions on the queries of the adversary.  We found that our approach leads to new insights  for both theory and practice. Moreover, we  introduce the notion of a diversifer, which does not  require additional storage, but allows the plaintext  of a particular sector to be encrypted to diferent  ciphertexts. We show how a 2-bit diversifer can  be implemented in the EagleTree simulator for  solid state drives (SSDs), while decreasing the total  number of Input/Output Operations Per Second  (IOPS) by only 4 %.

But attackers have  adapted and changed methods over the years  as well. Where do we stand today in the battle  between attackers and defenders? Are attackers  gaining ground, as it often seems when reading  press accounts of the latest data exposure? This  analysis seeks to answer these questions using  data from the U.S. National Vulnerability Database  (NVD), and to identify classes of vulnerabilities  where improvements will be most cost efective.

In IFIP Advances  in Information and Communication Technology 511,  Advances in Digital Forensics XIII, Revised Selected  Papers, pp. 111-130.  https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-67208-3_7  Cloud computing provides benefts such as  increased fexibility, scalability and cost savings  to enterprises. However, it introduces several  challenges to digital forensic investigations. Current  forensic analysis frameworks and tools are largely  intended for ofine investigations, and it is assumed  that the logs are under investigator control. In cloud  computing, however, evidence can be distributed  across several machines, most of which would  be outside the control of the investigator. Other  challenges include the dependence of forensically  valuable data on the cloud deployment model, large  volumes of data, proprietary data formats, multiple  isolated virtual machine instances running on a  single physical machine and inadequate tools for  conducting cloud forensic investigations.  This research demonstrates that evidence from  multiple sources can be used to reconstruct cloud  attack scenarios. The sources include: (i) intrusion  detection system and application software logs; (ii)  cloud service API calls; and (iii) system calls from  virtual machines. A forensic analysis framework for  cloud computing environments is presented that  considers logged data related to activities in the  application layer as well as lower layers. A Prolog- based forensic analysis tool is used to automate  the correlation of evidence from clients and the  cloud service provider in order to reconstruct attack  scenarios in a forensic investigation.

For large complex enterprises,  this is critical to limiting the legally authorized  access by insiders. However, the specifcations  describe the required access control capabilities  but not the related algorithms. Existing reference  implementations have inefcient algorithms and  thus, do not fully express the NGAC’s ability to scale.  For example, the primary NGAC reference  implementation took several minutes to simply  display the set of fles accessible to a user on a  moderately sized system. To solve this problem, we  provide efcient algorithms, reducing the overall  complexity from cubic to quadratic. Our other major  contribution is to provide a novel mechanism for  administrators and users to review allowed access  rights. We provide an interface that appears to be  a simple fle directory hierarchy but in reality is an  automatically generated structure abstracted from  the underlying access control graph that works  with any set of simultaneously instantiated access  control policies. Our work thus provides the frst  efcient implementation of NGAC while enabling  user privilege review through a novel visualization  approach. It thereby enables the efcient  simultaneous instantiation of multiple access control  policies that is needed to best limit insider access to  information (and thereby limit information leakage).

Proceedings of the 2nd Annual Industrial  Control System Security Workshop (ICSS ‘16), Los  Angeles, California, December 6, 2016, pp. 15-22.  https://doi.org/10.1145/3018981.3018986  Defense-in-depth is an important security  architecture principle that has signifcant application  to industrial control systems (ICS), cloud services,  storehouses of sensitive data, and many other areas.  We claim that an ideal defense-in-depth posture  is “deep,” containing many layers of security, and  “narrow,” the number of node independent attack  paths is minimized. Unfortunately, accurately  calculating both depth and width is difcult using  standard graph algorithms because of a lack of  independence between multiple vulnerability  instances (i.e., if an attacker can penetrate a  particular vulnerability on one host, then they  can likely penetrate the same vulnerability on  another host). To address this, we represent known  weaknesses and vulnerabilities as a type of colored  attack graph. We measure depth and width through  solving the shortest color path and minimum color  cut problems. We prove both of these to be NP- Hard and thus, for our solution, we provide a suite  of greedy heuristics. We then empirically apply our  approach to large randomly generated networks as  well as to ICS networks generated from a published  ICS attack template. Lastly, we discuss how to  use these results to help guide improvements to  defense-in-depth postures.  D. Moody, R. Perlner and D. Smith-Tone.  Improved Attacks for Characteristic-2 Parameters  of the Cubic ABC Simple Matrix Encryption  Scheme. 8th International Workshop on Post- Quantum Cryptography (PQCrypto 2017), Utrecht,  The Netherlands, June 26-28, 2017. In Lecture  Notes in Computer Science 10346, Post-Quantum  Cryptography - PQCrypto 2017, pp. 255-271.  https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-59879-6_15  In the last few years multivariate public key  cryptography has experienced an infusion of new  ideas for encryption. Among these new strategies is  the ABC Simple Matrix family of encryption schemes  that utilize the structure of a large matrix algebra to  construct efectively invertible systems of nonlinear  equations hidden by an isomorphism of polynomials.  One promising approach to cryptanalyzing these  schemes has been structural cryptanalysis, based  on applying a strategy similar to MinRank attacks to  the discrete diferential. These attacks however have  been signifcantly more expensive when applied to  parameters using felds of characteristic 2, which  have been the most common choice for published  parameters. This disparity is especially great for  the cubic version of the Simple Matrix Encryption  Scheme.  In this work, we demonstrate a technique that  can be used to implement a structural attack that  is as efcient against parameters of characteristic 2  as are attacks against analogous parameters over  higher characteristic felds. This attack demonstrates  that, not only is the cubic simple matrix scheme  susceptible to structural attacks, but that the  published parameters claiming 80 bits of security  are less secure than claimed (albeit only slightly.) 158  https://doi.org/10.1145/3018981.3018986 https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-59879-6_15  NIST/ITL CYBERSECURITY PROGRAM ANNUAL REPORT 2017  Similar techniques can also be applied to improve  structural attacks against the original Simple  Matrix Encryption scheme, but they represent only  a modest improvement over previous structural  attacks. This work therefore demonstrates that  choosing a feld of characteristic 2 for the Simple  Matrix Encryption Scheme or its cubic variant will  not provide any additional security value.  A.

HMFEv - An Efcient Multivariate Signature  Scheme. 8th International Workshop on Post- Quantum Cryptography (PQCrypto 2017), Utrecht,  The Netherlands, June 26-28, 2017. In Lecture  Notes in Computer Science 10346, Post-Quantum  Cryptography - PQCrypto 2017, pp. 205-223.  https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-59879-6_12  Multivariate Cryptography, as one of the  main candidates for establishing post-quantum  cryptosystems, provides strong, efcient and well- understood digital signature schemes such as  Unbalanced Oil-Vinegar (UOV), Rainbow, and Gui.  While Gui provides very short signatures, it is, for  efciency reasons, restricted to very small fnite  felds, which makes it hard to scale it to higher levels  of security and leads to large key sizes.  In this paper we propose a signature scheme  called HMFEv (“Hidden Medium Field Equations”),  which can be seen as a multivariate version of HFEv  (“Hidden Field Equation”). We obtain our scheme  by applying the Vinegar Variation to the Multi-HFE  encryption scheme of Chen et al. We show both  theoretically and by experiments that our new  scheme is secure against direct and Rank attacks.  In contrast to other schemes of the HFE family such  as Gui, HMFEv can be defned over arbitrary base  felds and therefore is much more efcient in terms  of both performance and memory requirements.  Our scheme is therefore a good candidate for  the upcoming standardization of post-quantum  signature schemes.  M. Raunak, D.R. Kuhn and R.N. Kacker.  Combinatorial Testing of Full Text Search in Web  Applications. Proceedings. 2017 IEEE International  Conference on Software Quality, Reliability and  Security (Companion Volume) (QRS-C 2017), Prague,  159 Czech Republic, July 25-29, 2017, pp. 100-107.  https://doi.org/10.1109/QRS-C.2017.24  Database-driven web applications are some of  the most widely developed systems today. In this  paper, we demonstrate the use of combinatorial  testing for testing database-supported web  applications, especially where full-text search is  provided or many combinations of search options  are utilized. We develop test-case selection  techniques, where test strings are synthesized using  characters or string fragments that may lead to  system failure. We have applied our approach to the  National Vulnerability Database (NVD) application  and have discovered a number of “corner-cases”  that had not been identifed previously. We also  present simple heuristics for isolating the fault- causing factors that can lead to such system failures.  The test method and input model described in this  paper have immediate application to other systems  that provide complex full text search.  X. Sun, A. Singhal and P. Liu. Towards Actionable  Mission Impact Assessment in the Context of Cloud  Computing. 31st IFIP Annual Conference on Data and  Applications Security and Privacy (DBSEC 2017),  Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, July 19-21, 2017. In Lecture  Notes in Computer Science 10359, DBSec 2017: Data  and Applications Security and Privacy XXXI, pp. 259- 274.  https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-61176-1_14  Today’s cyber-attacks toward enterprise  networks often undermine and even fail the mission  assurance of victim networks. Mission cyber  resilience (or active cyber defense) is critical to  prevent or minimize the negative consequences that  would impact missions. Without efective mission  impact assessment, mission cyber resilience cannot  be really achieved. However, there is an overlooked  gap between mission impact assessment and cyber  resilience due to the non-mission-centric nature of  current research. This gap is even widened in the  context of cloud computing. The gap essentially  accounts for the weakest link between missions and  attack-resilient systems, and also explains why the  existing impact analysis is not really actionable.  This paper initiates eforts to bridge this  gap by developing a novel graphical model that  interconnects the mission dependency graphs and  https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-59879-6_12 https://doi.org/10.1109/QRS-C.2017.24 https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-61176-1_14  ITL CYBERSECURITY PUBLICATIONS |  FY 2017  cloud-level attack graphs. Our case study shows  that the new cloud-applicable model is able to  bridge the gap between mission impact assessment  and cyber resilience. As a result, it can signifcantly  improve the efectiveness of the cyber resilience  analysis of mission critical systems.  S. Vilkomir, A. Alluri, D.R. Kuhn and R.N. Kacker.  Combinatorial and MC/DC Coverage Levels of  Random Testing. 2017 IEEE International Conference  on Software Quality Reliability and Security (QRS-C  2017), Prague, Czech Republic, July 25-29, 2017, pp.  61-68.  https://doi.org/10.1109/QRS-C.2017.19  Software testing criteria difer in their  efectiveness, the numbers of test cases required,  and the processes of test generation. Specifc  criteria often are compared to random testing, and  in some cases, random testing shows a surprisingly  high level of efectiveness. One reason that this is the  case is that any random test set has a specifc level  of coverage according to any coverage criterion. The  numerical evaluation of coverage levels of random  testing according to various coverage criteria is  an interesting research task and is important in  understanding the relationship between diferent  testing approaches.  In this paper, we performed an experimental  evaluation of the coverage levels of random testing  for two criteria: Modifed Condition/Decision  Coverage (MC/DC) and combinatorial t-way  testing. Our experiments showed that, when the  number of random test cases increased, a high level  of coverage was reached rapidly, both for MC/DC  and t-way. However, many more random tests are  required to reach 100 % coverage. An unexpected  result was that there were signifcant diferences  in the measurement of partial MC/DC coverage  by various tools. The results may be used to select  optimal methods for practical testing and develop  new testing methods based on the integration of  existing approaches.  160  https://doi.org/10.1109/QRS-C.2017.19  NIST/ITL CYBERSECURITY PROGRAM ANNUAL REPORT 2017  161  APPENDICES  The next section contains 3 Appendices (List of Acronyms, NIST/ITL  Cybersecurity Events, and Ways to Engage with ITL Cybersecurity  Program and NIST).

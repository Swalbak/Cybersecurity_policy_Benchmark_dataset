November 2020  8  EXECUTIVE SUMMARY  The railway sector enables goods and passengers to be transported within countries and across  borders, and is key to the development of the European Union. The main players within this  sector are the railway undertakings (RU), in charge of providing services for the transport of  goods and/or passengers by rail; and the infrastructure managers (IM), in charge of  establishing, managing and maintaining railway infrastructure and fixed installation, including  traffic management, control-command and signalling, but also station operation and train power  supply. Both are in the scope of the NIS Directive, and their identification as operator of  essential service (OES) respects the transposition of laws to the majority of member states.  Trends  According to surveys and interviews conducted under this study, overall trends for the  implementation of the NIS Directive for operator of essential service (OES) in the railway sector  are as follows:   The general implementation of security measures regarding governance and the  ecosystem is heterogeneous and low compared to other types of measures. Most  mature OES have already been applying these measures for a long time. Meanwhile  for less mature OES, implementation of these measures has just started.   Protective security measures seem to be the best implemented. While cybersecurity  basics appear to be already implemented, security measures requiring advanced  technical expertise show a lower level of implementation. In the special context of  operational technology (OT) (legacy, number of systems, dependence on suppliers,  safety concerns), it is often impossible to implement security basics without applying  compensating countermeasures,   For defensive security measures1, the simplest security measures (e.g.  communications with competent authorities and computer security incident response  teams) seem to be well implemented. Others, however, are rarely or not implemented,  as they require considerable cybersecurity expertise and maturity (e.g. log correlation  and analysis),   For resilience measures, the level of implementation appears to be good. Managing  crises and incidents is part of the daily business of the railway sector. However, this  must be qualified: there are still opportunities to improve the full integration of new  cybersecurity threats into existing processes for dealing with crises and ensuring  resilience.  Challenges  The study also identifies the main challenges faced by the sector to enforce the NIS Directive:   Railway stakeholders must strike a balance between operational requirements,  business competitiveness and cybersecurity, while the sector is undergoing digital  transformation which increases the need for cybersecurity.   Railway stakeholders depend on suppliers with disparate technical standards and  cybersecurity capabilities, especially for operational technology.  1 See NIS Directive Cooperation Group Publication 01/2018 - Reference document on security measures for Operators of  Essential Services http://ec.europa.eu/newsroom/dae/document.cfm?doc_id=53643  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/nis-directive/minimum-security-measures-for-operators-of-essentials-services  http://ec.europa.eu/newsroom/dae/document.cfm?doc_id=53643 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/nis-directive/minimum-security-measures-for-operators-of-essentials-services  RAILWAY CYBERSECURITY  November 2020  9   OT systems for railways have been based on systems that were at a point in time  secure according to the state-of-the art but due to the long lifetime of systems they  eventually become outdated or obsolete. This makes it difficult to keep them up-to-date  with current cybersecurity requirements. Furthermore, these systems are usually  spread across the network (stations, track, etc.), making it difficult to comprehensively  control cybersecurity.   Railway operators report issues of low cybersecurity awareness and differences in  culture, especially among safety and operations personnel.   Existing rail specific regulation doesn’t include cybersecurity provisions. OES often  have to comply with non-harmonized cybersecurity requirements deriving from different  regulations.  ERTMS is also covered in this study as a separate infrastructure due to its special requirements  and its cross-European nature.  Finally, trying to address some of the challenges described above, several European initiatives  which are presented in this report take place. ENISA is teaming up with the European Railway  Agency and the overall Railway community to bring these activities in the forefront.  RAILWAY CYBERSECURITY  November 2020  10  1. INTRODUCTION  Representing 472 billion passenger-kilometres2, 216,000 km of active railways3 and 430 billion  tonne-kilometres4 for freight transport, the railway sector plays an important and fast-growing  role. Railway infrastructure and systems are key assets, crucial to developing and protecting the  European Union.  The railway sector is undergoing a major transformation of its operations, systems and  infrastructure due to the digitisation of OT and IT systems and infrastructure, the automation of  railway processes, the issues of mass transit and the increasing numbers of interconnections  with external and multimodal systems. This sector is also evolving as it gradually opens up to  competition. This leads to the reallocation of responsibilities and the separation of railway  systems and infrastructure, which also affect IT systems.  In this context, it is becoming even more crucial for the railway sector to tackle cyber threats.  1.1 POLICY AND REGULATORY CONTEXT  Several bodies define and enforce regulations for the railway sector at International, EU or  national levels. Figure 1: Regulators overview presents the main stakeholders.  Figure 1: Regulators overview  2 See https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/Railway_passenger_transport_statistics_- _quarterly_and_annual_data  3 Knapčíková, Lucia & Konings, Rob.

At international level, the first initiative concerning the railway sector was the creation of the  International Union of Railways (UIC)5 in 1922, with 194 members across 5 continents. Today it  plays an important role in standardising and classifying railways through its UIC Codes6,  facilitating the sharing of best practice, promoting interoperability and developing skill centres.  Moreover, the first and unprecedented regulatory framework was the Convention Concerning  International Carriage by Rail (COTIF)7 of 9 May 1980, amended by the Vilnius Protocol of 3  June 1999 (\"the Accession Agreement\"), which resulted in the creation of the Intergovernmental  Organisation for Carriage by Rail (OTIF) with, in 2019, 51 members (the European Union  acceded to COTIF in 2011)8. The objectives are to develop uniform laws and rules for the  carriage of passengers and freight by rail, through technical functional requirements and model  contracts.  At European level, to develop a competitive railway transport system, promote the Single  European Railway Area and align with international regulations, the European Commission has  enforced several directives – mostly in four railway legislation packages listed in the Appendix  (Table 5). To fulfil these objectives, three main priorities have been defined:   opening the railway transport market up to competition,   improving the interoperability and safety of national networks, and   developing railway infrastructure.  However, the existing regulatory framework described above does not fully consider security,  particularly the cybersecurity issues specific to the railway sector. Over the past few years, the  European Commission has enforced directives and regulations regarding cybersecurity, but  which are applicable to all markets and sectors, described in the Table 6 (in the appendix at the  end of the document).  Directive 2016/1148 (NIS Directive) is the first legislative document focusing on cybersecurity,  extending the scope also to the railway sector. The following Operators of Essential Services  (OES) are identified:   Infrastructure managers as defined in point (2) of Article 3 of Directive  2012/34/EU9 namely: “any person or firm responsible in particular for establishing,  managing and maintaining railway infrastructure, including traffic management and  control-command and signalling. The functions of the infrastructure manager on a  network or part of a network may be allocated to different bodies or firms”.   Railway undertakings as defined in point (1) of Article 3 of Directive 2012/34/EU  namely “any public or private undertaking licensed according to this Directive, the  principal business of which is to provide services for the transport of goods and/or  passengers by rail with a requirement that the undertaking ensures traction. This  also includes undertakings which provide traction only”;  o including operators of service facilities as defined in point (12) of Article  3 of Directive 2012/34/EU namely “any public or private entity responsible  5 See https://uic.org/  6 The company code (also called RICS: \"Railway Interchange Coding System\" or railway code) is a 4 digit code used in  various applications to identify a company involved in the railway business.  7 See https://otif.org/fr/?page_id=172  8 See https://otif.org/en/?page_id=53  9 See https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:32012L0034&from=FR  https://uic.org/ https://otif.org/fr/?page_id=172 https://otif.org/en/?page_id=53 https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:32012L0034&from=FR  RAILWAY CYBERSECURITY  November 2020  12  for managing one or more service facilities or supplying one or more  services to railway undertakings”  In 2018, the UIC launched several events and publications to address cybersecurity issues in  the railway sector (e.g. Guidelines for Cyber-Security in Railways)10. Moreover, the Shift2Rail  Joint Undertaking11 was launched under the Horizon 2020 programme to seek focused  research and innovation (R&I) and market-driven solutions and promote competitiveness in the  European railway industry. The initiative included cybersecurity issues in the railway sector, for  example,  under the CYRAIL (CYbersecurity in the RAILway sector) project12, or under the  X2Rail-113 project and X2Rail-314 projects which included cybersecurity work packages.  1.2 STUDY SCOPE  This study regards the level of implementation of cybersecurity measures in the railway sector,  within the context of the enforcement of the NIS Directive in each European Member State. The  stakeholders involved in the scope of this study are European infrastructure managers (IM) and  railway undertakings (RU).  1.3 STUDY OBJECTIVES  The main objective of the study is to share a preliminary analysis of the level of maturity of the  railway sector regarding the implementation of security measures enforced by the NIS Directive.  An additional important element of the study is to identify the cybersecurity challenges that OES  in the railway sector face when applying these measures. Finally, this study takes a closer look  at cybersecurity for the European Railway Traffic Management System (ERTMS), because  some OES have already integrated parts of their services into ERTMS.  1.4 TARGET AUDIENCE  The main target audience for this study is composed of professionals in charge of IT and OT  security in the railway sector: railway undertakings (RU) and infrastructure managers (IM), or  any other stakeholders involved in the enforcement of security measures.  1.5 METHODOLOGICAL APPROACH  An online survey addressing cybersecurity issues was sent to stakeholders of the European  railway sector (railway undertakings and infrastructure managers).  The survey collected 41 answers, including 29 answers from OES (71%), representing 21  member states (Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Croatia, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia,  Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Poland,  Portugal, Romania, Spain, Sweden) and Norway. 48% of the respondents are infrastructure  managers, 24% are railway undertakings and 28% are organisations that have both roles. The  non-OES respondents (12 in total, 29%) represent certification bodies, companies from the  railway manufacturing industry, governmental bodies and authorities, or railway undertakings  and infrastructure managers that are not identified as OES, e.g. operating in countries such as  the Netherlands, and Norway.  10 See https://uic.org/IMG/pdf/uic_activity_report_2018.pdf  11 See https://shift2rail.org  12 See https://cyrail.eu/  13 X2Rail-1, Start-up activities for Advanced Signalling and Automation Systems,  https://projects.shift2rail.org/s2r_ip2_n.aspx?p=X2RAIL-1  14 X2Rail-3, Advanced Signalling, Automation and Communication System (IP2 and IP5) – Prototyping the future by means  of capacity increase, autonomy and flexible communication, https://projects.shift2rail.org/s2r_ip2_n.aspx?p=X2RAIL-3  https://uic.org/IMG/pdf/uic_activity_report_2018.pdf https://shift2rail.org/ https://cyrail.eu/  RAILWAY CYBERSECURITY  November 2020  13  Based on the survey answers, 14 OES were interviewed in order to understand their priorities  with respect to cybersecurity, challenges in implementing security measures and their  relationship with their competent national authority regarding the NIS Directive. The information  collected from the survey and interviews was analysed thoroughly and completed from desk  research to draft the report.  1.6 STRUCTURE OF THE REPORT  The report is structured as follows:   analysis of the policy and regulatory context of railways, particularly cybersecurity  for rail,   identification of status regarding the transposition of the NIS directive to EU  countries, especially the railway sector,   identification of essential services and critical information systems for the railway  sector, based on answers from the survey and interviews,   maturity assessment of the sector concerning implementation of the NIS directive,  based on answers from the survey and interviews,   a focus on European Railway Traffic Management System, the most critical  services and information system for the railway sector in Europe.  Figure 2: Survey respondents  RAILWAY CYBERSECURITY  November 2020  14  2. THE RAILWAY SECTOR  To date, the railway sector does not seem to have been a direct target for cyber criminals,  however several cyberattacks and incidents have taken place indicating the vulnerability of the  sector. Below a detailed list (not extensive) of the most referenced ones is presented (always  with a focus on the EU). Note that no OT and IT combined related incidents have occurred to  this day (based on publicly available information at the time of editing).   2015, Ukraine - DoS attack. An advanced persistent threat (APT) actor carried out a  large-scale coordinated attack to destabilize the Ukrainian government by targeting  power stations, mining and railway infrastructure. The aim of these attacks was to  paralyse public and critical infrastructure by disabling industrial control systems  (ICS).15   July 2015-2016, United Kingdom - Intrusion. Between July 2015 and July 2016, four  cyberattacks were discovered on the UK railway network. After analysis, these attacks  were considered as part of a reconnaissance operation before an APT (Advanced  Persistent Threat) attack, probably led by a national state threat actor. No disruption or  modification of data was detected. 16   May 2017, Germany - Ransomware. Deutsche Bahn was a victim of the WannaCry  ransomware. Some devices were corrupted and due to this could show no information  to the passengers anymore. Train operation was not disrupted17.   October 2017, Sweden - DoS attack.  The first attack took place on 11th of October,  affecting the Sweden Transport Administration (Trafikverket) via its two internet service  providers, TDC and DGC. The DDoS attack reportedly affected the IT system that  monitors trains' locations. It also took down the federal agency's email system,  website, and road traffic maps. Customers during this time were unable to make  reservations or receive updates on the delays. As a result, train traffic and other  services reportedly had to be managed manually, using back-up processes. The next  day, a second DDoS attack impacted the website of the Swedish Transport Agency, a  separate governmental body responsible for regulating and inspecting transportation  systems. It also affected Western Sweden public transport operator Vasttrafik,  reportedly crashing its ticket booking app and online travel planning service18.   May 2018, Denmark - DDoS. A DDoS attack impacted the ticketing systems of DSB.  The Danish travellers could not purchase tickets from ticket machines, the online  application, website and certain station kiosks. DSB estimated that approximately  15,000 customers were affected19.   March 2020, United Kingdom - Data breach. The email addresses and travel details  of about 10.000 people who used the free Wi-Fi provided UK railway stations have  been exposed online. Network Rail and the service provider C3UK confirmed the  incident. The database contained 146 million records, including personal contact  details and dates of birth. A breach involved the app ‘Indian Rail’ which is a top app on  the Apple App Store. It was due to an exposed Firebase database. The breach  contained 2.357.684 rows of emails, usernames and plain-text passwords20.  15 See https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-38573074  16 See https://news.sky.com/story/four-cyber-attacks-on-uk-railways-in-a-year-10498558  17 See https://www.reuters.com/article/us-cyber-attack-germany-rail-idUSKBN1890DM  18 See https://www.scmagazineuk.com/ddos-attacks-delay-trains-halt-transportation-services-sweden/article/1473963  19 See http://cphpost.dk/news/hackers-target-danish-train-service-over-the-weekend.html  20 See https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-51682280  https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-38573074 https://news.sky.com/story/four-cyber-attacks-on-uk-railways-in-a-year-10498558 https://www.reuters.com/article/us-cyber-attack-germany-rail-idUSKBN1890DM https://www.scmagazineuk.com/ddos-attacks-delay-trains-halt-transportation-services-sweden/article/1473963 http://cphpost.dk/news/hackers-target-danish-train-service-over-the-weekend.html https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-51682280  RAILWAY CYBERSECURITY  November 2020  15   May 2020, Switzerland - Malware. Swiss rail vehicle manufacturer Stadler was hit by  a malware attack that impacted all of its locations and may have allowed attackers to  steal sensitive company data. After compromising Stadler systems, attackers  reportedly infected its systems with malware that was then used to exfiltrate sensitive  corporate data from breached systems. Internal documents stolen during the cyber-  attack on Stadler’s headquarters have been published online after the manufacturer  refused to give in to ransom demands. 21   July 2020, Spain - Ransomware. Spanish Infrastructure Manager ADIF has been hit  by a ransomware not affecting critical infrastructure but exposing gigabytes of personal  and business data22.  2.1 RAILWAY STAKEHOLDERS  The rail ecosystem is well defined and organised, with several roles and responsibilities shared  between the stakeholders. The table and figure below depict and describe the ecosystem  actors.  Table 1: Descriptions of stakeholders  Stakeholder Description  Infrastructure  Manager  In Directive 2012/34/EU, the European Union defines an infrastructure manager as “any  person or firm responsible particularly for establishing, managing and maintaining railway  infrastructure, including traffic management and control-command and signalling. The  functions of the infrastructure manager on a network or part of a network may be  allocated to different bodies or firms”.  Railway  Undertakings  In Directive 2012/34/EU, the European Union defines a railway undertaking as “any public  or private undertaking licensed according to this Directive, the principal business of which  is to provide services for the transport of goods and/or passengers by rail with a  requirement that the undertaking ensure traction. This also includes undertakings which  provide traction only”.  Supply chain  Supply chain stakeholders provide railway and IT/OT assets to RUs and IMs. They may  be vendors of trains, ICS systems, IT systems, etc. The railway sector is dependent on  these suppliers, and their collaboration is vital to ensuring cybersecurity in the railway  sector.  Service providers  Service providers can be any third party contracted by RUs or IMs to perform all or part of  a service, which could be a business service (e.g. entity in charge of train maintenance)  or an IT/OT service (e.g. IT monitoring). Service providers include advisors, works  contractors, project management consultants, system providers, integrators.  Delivery chain  The delivery chain consists of all stakeholders involved in delivering the transport service  to customers, for freight (e.g. freight agencies, logistical companies) or passengers (e.g.  travel agencies, tourist brokers). It covers also third parties who interact with the railway  for service delivery (e.g. road transport companies).  Authorities and  bodies  Authorities and bodies consist of all stakeholders in charge of applying policies and  regulations in the railway sector (e.g. railway regulators, national and European  authorities for safety or cybersecurity, conformity assessment bodies, as notified body  and designated body).  Public areas  Public areas consist of all third parties who use railway premises to deliver goods or  services (more specifically in stations). They include providers of services for passengers  (e.g. sitting areas, lounges), as well as restaurants or retail outlets in stations.  Other entities  Other entities (e.g. banks, freight insurance) have relations with railway stakeholders. In  particular, several associations or working groups focus on certain topics in the railway  sector.  21 See https://www.stadlerrail.com/media/pdf/2020_0507_media%20release_cyber-attack_en.pdf  https://www.railjournal.com/technology/internal-documents-published-after-stadler-refuses-us-6m-ransom/  22 see https://www.railjournal.com/technology/adif-hit-by-cyberattack/  https://www.stadlerrail.com/media/pdf/2020_0507_media%20release_cyber-attack_en.pdf https://www.railjournal.com/technology/internal-documents-published-after-stadler-refuses-us-6m-ransom/ https://www.railjournal.com/technology/adif-hit-by-cyberattack/  RAILWAY CYBERSECURITY  November 2020  16  Figure 3: Railway stakeholder map  Based on the analysis of the survey answers:   the majority of OES collaborate on cybersecurity matters with national bodies, e.g.  government, safety or cybersecurity agencies, ministries of transport or infrastructure,  national computer security incident response teams (CSIRTs) or computer emergency  response teams (CERTs), authorities responsible for crisis or emergency  management, disaster management, national security, counterterrorism, or data  protection;   many OES report collaboration with European bodies, such as ENISA, ERA23, DG  CONNECT24, DG MOVE25,  CENELEC26, and the European Rail ISAC27;   several OES also mention other organisations and associations that they work with,  such as UIC28, CER29, ERFA30, RailNetEurope31, FTE32, COLPOFER33, Hitrail34.  23 See https://www.era.europa.eu/  24 See https://ec.europa.eu/info/departments/communications-networks-content-and-technology_en  25 See https://ec.europa.eu/knowledge4policy/node/6657_fr  26 See https://www.cenelec.eu/  27 See https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/national-cyber-security-strategies/information-sharing  28 See https://uic.org/  29 See http://www.cer.be/  30 See http://erfarail.eu/  31 See https://rne.eu/  32 See http://www.forumtraineurope.eu/home/  33 See http://www.colpofer.org/content/cfer/en.html  34 See https://www.hitrail.com/  https://www.era.europa.eu/ https://ec.europa.eu/info/departments/communications-networks-content-and-technology_en https://ec.europa.eu/knowledge4policy/node/6657_fr https://www.cenelec.eu/ https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/national-cyber-security-strategies/information-sharing https://uic.org/ http://www.cer.be/ http://erfarail.eu/ https://rne.eu/ http://www.forumtraineurope.eu/home/ http://www.colpofer.org/content/cfer/en.html https://www.hitrail.com/  RAILWAY CYBERSECURITY  November 2020  17  2.1.1 NIS Directive implementation – Authorities  All EU Member States (MS) have already transposed the NIS Directive in their national  regulatory framework. The European Commission published in October 2019 a report35  establishing a first assessment on the different approaches chosen by Member States to  enforce the NIS Directive and develop a special focus on the railway subsector.  The report highlights the fact that MS have chosen different approaches to enforcing NIS  implementation, and explains the variations between MS. Several variations are explained, the  identification methods chosen by each national authority, the definition of the list of essential  services, and the identification of OES.  Table 2 details the different approaches chosen by MS for the transport sector and the railway  subsector, and the overarching authority. The key findings relating to the context of this report  are the following:   All member states have identified the transport sector as essential.   All member states, with the exception of the Netherlands, have identified the  railway subsector explicitly as essential.   There are two approaches to the identification of the competent authority for the  NIS Directive: either a unique national authority, chiefly focussing on cybersecurity  issues, or one authority per sector, usually the relevant ministry, addressing  sectorial issues including cybersecurity.

In particular, member states have chosen:   not to specify rail-specific essential services,   to distinguish between RU and IM, as two essential rail services,   to distinguish between separate activities such as freight and passenger transport,  or   to draw a detailed list of essential services, such as dangerous goods  management, or maintenance.  To ensure that data is comparable, and for drafting this report, eight essential railway services  have been defined and specified in the survey:   operating traffic on the network,   ensuring the safety and security of passengers and/or goods,   maintaining railway infrastructure and/or trains,   managing invoicing and finance (billing),   planning operations and book resources,   information for passengers and customers about operations,   carrying goods and/or passengers, and   selling and distributing tickets.  The respondents to the survey were asked to assess which of these services were essential for  their organisation. The essential services identified by the majority of respondents are  “operating traffic on the network” (72%), “ensuring the safety and security of passengers  and/or goods” (69%), and “maintaining railway infrastructure and/or trains” (59%).  39 See https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A52019DC0546  https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A52019DC0546  RAILWAY CYBERSECURITY  November 2020  20  Figure 4: Identification of essential railway services  The assessment of these essential services differs for each type of OES (RU, IM and OES that  with both roles). Figure 5 illustrates the differences between the services selected as essential  for each type of OES.  Figure 5: Essential services identified for each type of OES  From the results above, we make the following observations.   “Operating traffic on the network” is considered the most essential service for all OES  (71% for IM, 71% for RU and 100% for OES with both roles).   “Maintaining railway infrastructure and/or trains” is identified as essential for IM (64%)  and for OES with both roles (75%), but fewer RU considered it as essential (only 29%).   “Carrying goods and/or passengers” is identified as one of the most essential services  by RU (57%) and for OES with both roles (88%), whereas only 7% of IM considered it  as essential.   “Ensuring the safety and security of passengers and/or goods” was identified as one of  the more essential services for all types of OES (64% for IM, 43% for RU and 100% for  OES with both roles).  The results offer no surprises; they represent well the implemented split in hierarchy in the area  of responsibility of the two actors in the sector. Security and safety is a priority for the entire  RAILWAY CYBERSECURITY  November 2020  21  sector. Due to the increasing competition in several European MS, several RUs share train  operations, but only a few are in charge of infrastructure management. This makes the IM’s role  in delivering essential services for railways more prominent, as multiple RUs depend on often a  single IM.  2.2.1 NIS Directive Implementation – Essential Services  In the implementation of the NIS Directive each MS has identified essential railway services  (when railway has been identified as essential sector). It needs to be underlined that the  definition of essential services related to the railway subsector has not been standardised. MS  apply varying levels of granularity in the definition of rail essential services (detailed in the next  section).

RAILWAY CYBERSECURITY  November 2020  26  Based on this overview, the OES respondents of the survey identified their critical information  systems which support their essential services. Overall, the most critical systems identified by  all types of OES (IM, RU and OES with both roles) are systems for Security and Safety, and  for Operations (Signalling, Command-Control and Telecommunications).  Figure 7: Critical Information Systems for each type of OES  RAILWAY CYBERSECURITY  November 2020  27  3. CYBERSECURITY MEASURES  3.1 CYBERSECURITY CHALLENGES  Based on answers to the survey, interviews and findings shared by experts with ENISA, the  following cybersecurity challenges for OES in the railway sector seeking to implement security  measures can be highlighted:   Low digital and cybersecurity awareness in the railway sector.   Difficulty in reconciling safety and cybersecurity worlds.   Digital transformation of railway core business.   Dependence on the supply chain for cybersecurity.   Geographic spread of railway infrastructure and the existence of legacy systems.   The need to balance security, competiveness and operational efficiency.   Complexity of regulations for cybersecurity.  Low digital and cybersecurity awareness in the railway sector. Overall, staff awareness of  the need for cybersecurity remains quite low, but OES report that awareness is slowly  increasing, as cyber incidents targeting the railway sector increase and become public. For  instance, after the Wannacry and NotPetya attacks, the cybersecurity teams of some OES in  the railway sector have grown in numbers, following the examples of other sectors.  Difficulty in reconciling safety and cybersecurity worlds. In the railway sector, the  importance of safety requirements is undisputable. For each update to introduce provisions for  cybersecurity, safety teams need to ensure that safety mechanisms remain intact. This requires  extra time and money. Moreover, stakeholders in charge of safety issues are not historically  aware and trained to deal with cybersecurity. This complicates relations between safety and  cybersecurity staff. Additionally, it appears to be difficult to deal simultaneously with safety and  security authorities. Each have their own requirements that may sometimes overlap or  contradict each other (e.g. managing system updates for cybersecurity, while obsolete IT  components may still be accredited for the highest level of safety). This actually indicates that  the discrepancy is evident not only from a technical perspective but in governance issues as  well.  Digital transformation of railway core business. Most railway OES are currently undergoing  digital transformation and a wide range of IT and connected devices (IoT) are introduced to  railway systems, often without being properly procured, mapped and managed. These changes  introduce new vulnerabilities and highlight the need for OT systems to comply with the same, or  even higher, cybersecurity provisions as IT systems. Network assets, network connected  devices, software developments should be treated with the same (or greater) care in the  operational field. Like IT systems, OT systems should come with monitoring, supervision and  administration tools offered or even embedded. Moreover new OT systems should have  integrated already safety and cybersecurity requirements by design.  Dependence on the supply chain for cybersecurity. OES report that are heavily reliant on  their suppliers, providers and other third parties for system updates, patch management, and  lifecycle management (supplier as a term can even include cloud service providers). Reasons  for this dependence include safety, operational and financial responsibilities, compliance with  safety, cybersecurity and technical standards, cost, and contractual obligations. RUs and IMs  rely on multiple suppliers for their IT systems, and even more so when it comes to OT systems  Railway  stakeholders  must strike a  balance between  operational  requirements,  business  competitiveness  and  cybersecurity,  while the sector  is undergoing  digital  transformation.  RAILWAY CYBERSECURITY  November 2020  28  on board trains or on trackside and OCC. Each supplier may adopt individual techniques to  satisfy similar functional requirements. This can increase the challenge of standardization and  the ability to define and implement baseline cybersecurity measures for all systems. Awareness  of the need for cybersecurity and the associated skills vary according to each supplier. This  leads to disparate levels of cybersecurity in OT systems. Moreover, provisions for suppliers are  not defined under the NIS Directive, so they have less stringent statutory requirements to apply  cybersecurity. Finally, several years may elapse between a tender process for a system and its  deployment. In the meantime, cybersecurity requirements change and the supply chain may not  be agile enough to integrate the new requirements.  Geographic spread of railway infrastructure and the existence of legacy systems. Railway  infrastructure is distributed over a wide territory shared between metropolitan areas - where  critical nodes of railway systems and networks require maximum availability, and in the  countryside – where protection and maintenance costs time and money. Trackside equipment  updates, in particular, can have an important financial repercussion.  Moreover, IMs and RUs manage many legacy or obsolete systems – with lifecycles calculated  in decades – which are difficult or even impossible to upgrade in order to implement  cybersecurity measures. Some manufacturers have even lost the technical skills to upgrade  them. Obsolescent OT requires procedures, policies and human intervention for patches and  updates, to ensure an adequate security level. Lifecycle management which covers  cybersecurity should be planned and anticipated for new systems.  The need to balance security, competiveness and operational efficiency. Rail transport is  often a public service, to be affordable for travellers. OES must keep ticket prices as low as  possible, otherwise travellers will choose other transport modes. However, OES must  implement cybersecurity measures which are costly, without being able to increase their own  revenue by raising the price of train tickets. Therefore, OES often encounter major problems  reserving budgets for cybersecurity projects. They have to tread a fine line between respecting  the budget and increasing the level of security, as in other transport sub-sectors. Additionally,  railways require nationwide investment (for trackside systems) by IMs, which also need to be  financed by service revenue. By comparison, transport by water or air travels do not require  investment all over the territory. Moreover, reinforcing the security of systems can complicate  data flows and systems (e.g. cryptography, system segregation). These can strongly impact  system performance or availability if any issues arise (e.g. expiry of a certificate).  Complexity and lack of harmonization of regulations for cybersecurity. For some OES,  understanding statutory constraints, especially the NIS Directive, may be difficult. Compliance  may require time-consuming work integrating large volumes of information and performing many  administrative tasks, as OES try to comply with cybersecurity requirements imposed by different  national regulations. Several report that beyond the NIS Directive, they have to comply with  other national laws, such as national security or critical infrastructure ones. In general, OES  recognise the importance of developing statutory cybersecurity requirements and initiatives at  national and European levels. Benefits identified by OES include awareness raising, sharing of  best practices, potential funding, and stronger requirements for cybersecurity on suppliers.  However, such requirements should be harmonized across the EU, as OES that operate in  multiple MS often face different compliance requirements. Such harmonization is key for the  suppliers as well, as they often offer products and services across the EU. Finally, the security  measures promoted by the NIS Directive are not at present specific to each sector. Some OES  have expressed the need for more flexible operational guidelines to fit the specificities and  organisation of the railway sector.  RAILWAY CYBERSECURITY  November 2020  29  3.2 MINIMUM SECURITY MEASURES  The security measures examined in the survey were defined by the NIS Directive Cooperation  Group45. They have been classified in 4 domains, and 29 security measures as depicted in the  figure below. They are described in more detail in Table 8 of the Appendix.  Figure 8: Security measures for OES  Figure 9 provides a high-level view of the level of implementation of security measures for OES  in the railway sector, highlighting the differences between the four main domains of security  measures.   Security measures related to governance, risk management and ecosystem  management are either implemented or implemented and controlled by 47% of  OES. Several such measures are partially implemented because, in fact, several OES  report that they are currently launching organisation-wide cybersecurity programmes,  to comply with the NIS Directive and other national cybersecurity requirements, and to  improve their cybersecurity posture. These measures can be particularly important as  they often are a requisite step to increasing the implementation level for all security  measures.  45 See CG Publication 01/2018 - Reference document on security measures for Operators of Essential Services  http://ec.europa.eu/newsroom/dae/document.cfm?doc_id=53643  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/nis-directive/minimum-security-measures-for-operators-of-essentials-services  http://ec.europa.eu/newsroom/dae/document.cfm?doc_id=53643 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/nis-directive/minimum-security-measures-for-operators-of-essentials-services  RAILWAY CYBERSECURITY  November 2020  30   Protection measures are implemented or implemented and controlled by 53% of  OES. Basic cybersecurity seems to be already well implemented and under control,  e.g. access control, or system segregation. However, the security measures that  require higher technical expertise, such as cryptographic controls, or cybersecurity  controls on industrial control systems (OT) are implemented at a lower rate. This can  be explained by specific context of railway OT that poses challenges to OES in fully  implementing such minimum protection security measures. Reasons include the  presence of legacy systems, the high number of systems and complexity of IM  networks, dependence on suppliers for security solutions and safety concerns when  updating such systems.   Security measures regarding defence are either implemented or implemented  and controlled by 52% of OES. Security measures that require less technical  expertise, e.g. communications with competent authorities and CSIRTs, or incident  reporting, appear to be well implemented and under control. Other measures that  require resources, maturity and expertise (e.g. log correlation and analysis) appear to  be more challenging for OES to implement.   Resilience measures are implemented or implemented and controlled by 57% of  OES. OES report that managing crises and incidents is part of the daily business in the  railway sector. The sector is already regulated for safety and security, and operational  continuity. However, these statistics should be treated with caution. Although  measures to protect operations and prevent safety or security incidents are generally  well applied, the same level of preparedness is not observed when countering  cybersecurity threats and incidents. Current processes for crisis and business  continuity management need to be adapted to cover cybersecurity incidents.  Figure 9: Overall view of the implementation level for cybersecurity measures  RAILWAY CYBERSECURITY  November 2020  31  3.2.1 Governance and ecosystem  Based on the analysis of answers to the survey, Figure 10 highlights the implementation level of  the eight security measures related to “Governance and ecosystem”. This figure is followed by  key findings, based on answers to the interview and desk research.  Figure 10: Implementation level of “Governance and ecosystem” security measures  Key findings  Key findings regarding the “Governance and ecosystem” security measures are as follows:   The measure “Security Risk Analysis” seems to be partially implemented (55%).  Indeed, when as IMs and RUs are identified as OES according to the NIS Directive,  they are asked to identify their critical systems, based on a risk-based approach.  Conducting a risk analysis is usually one of the first steps toward compliance with the  NIS Directive. Most of the OES interviewed have on-going activities to fully apply this  measure in the near future, coupled with updating their Security Policy to cover all  systems of the organisation (66% have already implemented this measure).   Regarding “Security Accreditation”, security assessments seem to be implemented by  48% of the OES. OES recognise the importance of protecting critical systems by  including cybersecurity reviews in all projects. However, it is not so easy to include  cybersecurity in all railway projects, particularly because of their special characteristics.  The construction of railway infrastructure and systems are lengthy projects, involving  third parties and suppliers who are not always familiar with cybersecurity. Moreover,  the requirements of cybersecurity regulations are relative newcomers, unlike safety  requirements which already require systems accreditation. Enforcing a cybersecurity  accreditation process seems to be perceived as a secondary step after setting up  security measures.   Defining, assessing and monitoring security indicators seem to be only partially  implemented (38%). Governance and policies must be fully enforced, and experience  on several security measures must be acquired before taking a step back to define the  relevant Key Performance Indicators (KPIs). Furthermore, it must be possible to collect  and process data from a potentially wide range of sources, which can pose an  additional challenge to OES.   For the “Security audit” measure (52%), two main trends can be highlighted: the most  mature OES conduct regular audits to check the level of cybersecurity and compliance  with their security policy, whereas the least mature ones regard this as a secondary  step, to be taken after implementing security measures. For some OES, audits of  legacy systems and others may be difficult to conduct. Finally, most OES are aware of  the measures that need to be implemented to better protect their critical systems, but  66% of OES have  updated their  Security Policy  to include all  systems of the  organisation,  including  operational  technology.  RAILWAY CYBERSECURITY  November 2020  32  they perceive an audit a waste of time and budget, if implementation of measures has  not progressed beforehand.   “Human resource security” seems to be partially implemented (48%) for two main  reasons: key personnel have been appointed by most OES (chief information security  officers (CISO) and cybersecurity project managers are already at work, there are  plans to appoint more cybersecurity experts) and awareness campaigns are being  planned or conducted. However, awareness campaigns take time to produce results,  especially in the railway sector where the core business is closer to the physical than  the digital world, and even further from cybersecurity issues.   The two security measures related to “Ecosystem management” appear difficult to  implement and control completely. 41% of OES report that they have mapped their  ecosystem and 31% have mapped relations to third parties. The railway ecosystem is  complex to map, due to the number of third parties and suppliers. For instance, for one  single system there may be several suppliers, with widely differing levels of technology  thus cybersecurity.  3.2.2 Protection  Based on the analysis of answers to the survey, figure 11 presents the implementation of 11  security measures related to the security domain “Protection”. This figure is followed by key  findings, based on answers to the interview and desk research.  Figure 11: Implementation level of “Protection” security measures  Key findings  For security measures from the “Protection” domain, the key findings are as follows:   Security measures, such as “Traffic filtering”, and “Physical and environmental  security” seem to be the most implemented (69% report that they have implemented  them). “Traffic filtering” is considered as cybersecurity basics, is already set up for  many years and every OES seem to have already deployed firewall systems and  access control policies. “Physical and environmental security” is covered in the existing  safety and security regulatory requirements and widely deployed. This shall be  balanced as the rail network is usually very wide and it seems complicated to keep a  homogeneous physical security of all local IT assets, which can be located in stations  or near the tracks;   The security measure “System configuration” has low implementation rate of this  category (45%). Indeed, it seems that this security measure is difficult to apply to  RAILWAY CYBERSECURITY  November 2020  33  legacy or old systems. As a result, most of the interviewed OES reserve this measure  for the newest systems.   The security measures “System segregation” seem to be the most implemented (50%  for both) in this domain. Most OES have already segregated OT and IT systems and  networks, but not yet tackled more advanced segregation (separating IT and OT  systems based on business criticality for example). However, IT and OT tend to  become more interconnected, so this could change the way of implementation and  further complicate the segregation of critical systems from the others. European  standards are seeking to propose a common definition as a solution to help solve this  complexity.   The security measure “Cryptography” seems to be the most difficult to implement (only  24%). Indeed, OT systems, often legacy systems, usually do not natively support  cryptography mechanisms. Moreover, this measure requires setting up complex  projects and defining special architecture for cybersecurity (e.g. public key  infrastructure, certificate management) which requires specialised cybersecurity  expertise. Lastly, implementing such measures can severely limit the availability of  systems if they are not well managed (e.g. certificate lifecycle management).   The security measures “Administrative accounts”, “Access Rights” and “Authentication  and identification” seems mostly implemented (59%, 69% and 59% respectively). It  seems the railway sector is acutely aware of the criticality of administrative accounts  and access rights. OES seem to have already set up the authentication and  identification mechanisms (e.g. nominative accounts, strong passwords, logging  registration), considered as cybersecurity basics. This is not always the case for legacy  and embedded systems, usually OT, for which such measures (e.g. complex  passwords) may not be possible. Projects are ongoing to fully implement this measure,  while efforts are taken by OES to control better such access control processes.   The security measure “Administration information systems” is relatively implemented  (52%) which is expected due to the high dependencies the OES have against  suppliers’ systems and services. This rate will rend cybersecurity configuration into a  requirement during procurement.   The security measure “IT Security Maintenance procedure” seems less difficult to  implement for RUs (71%) than for IMs (28%). It appears to be more difficult for IMs to  map and maintain their systems, geographically distributed over the national territory  with strong local specificities. By contrast, it seems easier for RUs which have to  maintain their fleet of trains (mobile systems). Moreover, due to the ongoing trend for  deregulating the railway sector, the railway market is being shared out among RUs –  including newcomers managing fleets of new and modern trains which are easier to  maintain. In the meantime, IMs have to go on managing more-or-less the same  infrastructure and systems, some of which are legacy and obsolete and are difficult to  maintain.   The security measure “Industrial control systems” (ICS) has a lower implementation  rate (38%). Indeed, usual security measures are not always applicable for those  systems, as often they are legacy systems, without security by design, and changes to  them raises safety concerns. It requires strong cybersecurity expertise to enforce  compensatory security measures on those systems and rail ecosystem has a strong  dependency on the supply chain on this. For newest systems, OES need to adapt the  procurement process to include cybersecurity requirements and involve cybersecurity  experts from the beginning, for systems that may be deployed on the network up to 5  years after the process. A few RUs also reported that those systems are not directly  under their responsibility but under the responsibility of train suppliers.  Cryptographic  controls are the  most difficult  measure to  implement in the  sector (only 24%  implement the  measure). They  require  specialised  cybersecurity  expertise, and  support from  vendors, to  ensure  availability of  systems and  safety are  guaranteed.  RAILWAY CYBERSECURITY  November 2020  34  3.2.3 Defence  Based on the analysis of survey answers,  Figure 12 highlights the implementation level of the 6 security measures related to “Defence”.  This figure is followed by key findings, based on answers to the interview, and desk research.  Figure 12: Level of implementation of “Defence” security measures  Key findings  Regarding “Defence”, the key findings are as follows:   The security measure “Communication with competent authorities and computer  security incident response teams (CSIRT)” seems to be the most widely implemented  (69%). Indeed, most of the OES communicate with the competent authorities about the  NIS Directive and its implementation. This is only natural, as communication with  relevant authorities in case of an incident is nowadays a legal requirement.   The security measure “Logging” seems to be the most partially implemented by the  majority of OES (55%), including IMs and RUs. Logging seems to be perceived as a  cybersecurity basic, especially for standard logs (e.g. authentication, management of  account and access rights). However, works are ongoing in order to apply these  measures to IT systems or to update log management (logs are stored for longer).   The security measures “Detection” (31%) and “Log correlation and analysis” (31%)  seem to be the most difficult to implement. Specialised cybersecurity expertise and  complex projects are required to deploy detection and log correlation and analysis  mechanisms  (e.g. vulnerability monitoring, identification of feared events, definition of  detection rules based on existing or feared events). This finding is even more  pronounced for OT systems, managed more generally by IMs.   “Information system security incident response” (55%) and “Incident reporting” (72%)  seem to be widely implemented. Dealing efficiently with incidents and reporting are  vital skills in the railway sector. RUs and IMS must deal with safety or security  incidents daily. However, existing incident management processes may need to be  reviewed, to fully cover the specificities of cyber incidents.  69% of OES  report that they  fully implement  “physical and  environmental  security” on all  their  infrastructures  and networks.  RAILWAY CYBERSECURITY  November 2020  35  3.2.4 Resilience  Based on the analysis of survey answers, Figure 13 highlights the implementation level of the 4  security measures related to “Resilience”. This figure is followed by key findings, based on  answers to the interview and desk research, in order to highlight the trends.  Figure 13: Implementation level of “Resilience” security measures  Key findings   Security measures “Business continuity management” and “Disaster recovery  management” seem to be partially implemented (both at 52%), for the same reasons  as incident management. In the railway sector, most RUs and IMS seem to have  already defined and tested business continuity and disaster recovery plans for safety,  security and disaster (e.g. fire or flood prevention), managed and followed up by  business teams. These plans must be updated to include cyber threats and their  evolution (e.g. offline backups for resilience in case of a ransomware attack).   The security measures “Crisis management organization” (69%) and “Crisis  management process” (55%) also seem to be well implemented. For the reasons  described above, stakeholders of the railway sector are accustomed to managing  crises as part of their daily work. However, crisis management processes and  exercises appear to concern mainly physical security and safety incidents (e.g.  derailment, obstacles on track, power outages), but cybersecurity scenarios are not  fully covered yet, and they require a different approach to crisis management. Crises  require rapid intervention by IT and cybersecurity experts, and they may be more  widespread – occurring in many stations at once - than local safety incidents - in a  specific station for example. Most mature OES perform emergency exercises to  simulate cyberattacks.  Cybersecurity  scenarios are not  covered yet on  all railway OES,  but mature  railway  organisations  already perform  emergency  exercises to  simulate  cyberattacks.  RAILWAY CYBERSECURITY  November 2020  36  4. CYBERSECURITY IN ERTMS  4.1 ERTMS DEFINITION AND ARCHITECTURE  The European Rail Traffic Management System (ERTMS) is a single European signalling and  speed control system that ensures interoperability of the railway systems, with the aim of  reducing the purchasing and, possibly, maintenance costs of the signalling systems. It can, in  some cases, as well increase the speed of trains and the capacity of infrastructure. The main  added benefit of ERTMS is to allow interoperability, stepping away from the installation of  diverse trackside systems requiring the corresponding distinct on-board systems. ERA plays the  role of system authority for ERTMS. In that respect, it establishes a transparent process to  manage, with the contribution of the sector’s representatives, any system changes.  ERTMS comprises of the European Train Control System (ETCS), i.e. a cab-signalling system  that incorporates automatic train protection, the Global System for Mobile communications for  Railways (GSM-R) and operating rules. More specifically:  ERTMS comprises of the European Train Control System (ETCS), i.e. a cab-signalling system  that incorporates automatic train protection, the Global System for Mobile communications for  Railways (GSM-R) and operating rules. More specifically:   ETCS (European Train Control System). The signalling element of the system which  includes the control of movement authorities, automatic train protection and the  interface to interlocking in a harmonised way. It allows the stepwise reduction of  complexity for train drivers (automation of control activities) - It brings trackside  signalling into the driver’s cabin - It provides information to the on-board display - It  allows for permanent train control – The train driver concentrates on core tasks.   GSM-R (Global System for Mobiles - Railway). The telecommunication network offers  both a voice communication service between driving vehicles and line controllers and a  bearer path for ETCS data. It is based on the public standard GSM with specific  railway features for operation e.g. Priority and Pre-emption (eMLPP) - Functional  Addressing Location Dependent Addressing - Voice Broadcast Service (VBS) - Voice  Group Call (VGC) - Shunting Mode - Emergency Calls - Fast call set-up. General  Packet Radio Service (GPRS option) can also be used in GSM-R networks to offer  more data possibilities.  ETML (European Traffic Management Layer). The operation management level is intended to  optimise train movements by the \"intelligent\" interpretation of timetables and train running data.  It is expected to involve the improvement of real-time train management and route planning -  railway node fluidity - customer and operating staff information across international railway  networks.  The following illustration provides an overview of the main ERTMS equipment and its  interconnections.

In future, they will be more and more transmitted on-line.  RAILWAY CYBERSECURITY  November 2020  39  4.2 CYBERSECURITY ON ERTMS  ERTMS is a standardised solution with an architecture defined in the Control Command and  Signalling Technical Specifications for Interoperability (CCS TSI)47. However, maintenance tools  and the external interfaces (interlocking, maintenance system, traffic management system  (TMS), etc.) are open and depend on the chosen system supplier. More and more systems  allow remote access through maintenance tools to the radio block centre (RBC), GSM-R, etc.,  increasing the associated risks and widening the attack vector. More and more information  management systems (IMS) require global connected systems to improve the performance and  provide new services to passengers.  As any signalling and command and control system, ERTMS has high availability and safety  integrity requirements, as these are related to service provision and safety. If we consider  cybersecurity, these are reflected on availability and integrity requirements for the ICT systems.  Confidentiality requirements refer mainly to the protection of information needed for access  control in relevant systems or to the protection of cryptographic keys. For example, there is high  need for protection of the radio block centre (RBC) in respect of its availability and integrity for  the following two reasons:   If it fails, and especially if it fails on lines without conventional signalling, it would:  o make the line nearly inoperable; trains would have to be re-directed, which  would overload other lines;  o mean that the trains on the line in question would have to clear the relevant  section, i.e. measures that would reduce the operational safety would  inevitably have to be taken.   It is, of course, of decisive importance for signalling and control-command systems that  the data are collected, transmitted and processed correctly as corrupted, untimely or  suppressed data could have consequences to operational safety.  Moreover, the communication interfaces, such as communication between the vehicle and the  track, should be protected against attacks. An attack on communication via a few manipulated  balises and their telegrams seems to be very disproportionate in view of the short effective  radius, but that does not mean that the likelihood of such an attack could be ignored. An attack  on the communication via the radio interface is more critical because it can be made at a remote  workstation and, thus, affect several vehicles at the same time resulting into a large scale crisis  (possibly DDoS attack), impacting both safety and availability. Securing communication  interfaces should become a priority for the Railway community and ERA.  This is also relevant for the other trackside elements (radio infill, euroloop, balises, LEUs), and  for the OBU: when those elements fail, it may have a negative safety consequence or it may not  allow the train to continue its trip.  The development of ETCS is according to European standards (including EN50128, EN50129)  and complies with safety integrity level 4 (SIL4) requirements. If an internal failure occurs, the  train should be stopped by the system. However, threats can impact operations and some  safety functions, such as speed restrictions. Some cybersecurity measures are already  available, but an in-depth analysis of threats, attack vectors and measures to be derived in this  context has not been conducted yet. A detailed analysis is needed to assess which  cybersecurity requirements for railway systems including ERTMS should be mandatory or  optional features, and which minimum specifications for such controls should be offered by  ERTMS suppliers. For instance, up-to-date cryptographic requirements should be specified.  47 See https://www.era.europa.eu/activities/technical-specifications-interoperability_en  As any signalling  and command  and control  system, ERTMS  has high  availability and  safety integrity  requirements, as  these are related  to service  provision and  safety.  If we consider  cybersecurity,  these are  reflected on high  availability and  integrity  requirements for  the ICT systems.  https://www.era.europa.eu/activities/technical-specifications-interoperability_en  RAILWAY CYBERSECURITY  November 2020  40  A recent analysis by CYSIS Working Group (Subgroup: ETCS and Security) works towards this  direction. It reveals that it is very unlikely that an attack on the balises will be successful due to  the implemented security functions, in case these are active. Man-in-the-middle attacks are at  least in principle possible, but only if the symmetric keys in use are attacked simultaneously with  purposively tapping of the communication. Moreover, an attack in the form of purposive  manipulation and copying of the GSM-R infrastructure is possible, but only at extremely high  efforts.  Several cybersecurity measures for rail systems like the one analysed in the previous section,  are also needed for ERTMS. Implementation of cybersecurity measures, however, face  challenges in ERTMS:   Several measures are directly dependent on ERTMS supply chain and it is difficult to  implement/enhance these measures in legacy systems.   Software updates are complex, expensive, time consuming and dependent on the  intervention of ERTMS suppliers. In some cases, those updates could even require a  review of vehicle authorisation.   Lack of rigorous tender specifications to be shared amongst OES make any  implementation even more cumbersome.  Examples of types of cybersecurity measures for ERTMS would include:   measures for the balises/loop to verify the authenticity of data, i.e. by signing the data;   measures to minimise the effect of reduced availability on the communication between  the OBU and the RBC;   measures for integrity and authenticity of the communication, especially from and to  the RBC;   event logging and analysis;   access control measures, such as “Administrative accounts” and “Authentication and  identification” security measures;   an update/patching policy for key components, e.g. GSM-R, RBC etc.;   ensuring network controls are implemented (network segregation, no direct internet  connection, no remote access by administrators, ensuring unnecessary services,  interfaces, protocols and port numbers are not activated, etc.);   state-of-the-art key and certification management and distribution; and   a scalable key management centre (KMC) and the related public key infrastructure  (PKI).  These measures are mere examples and need to be assessed for feasibility after a threat  assessment of the ERTMS is conducted.  RAILWAY CYBERSECURITY  November 2020  41  5. CONCLUSIONS  For the Railway sector the introduction of IP networks in signalling and power systems is a key  issue to be assessed and further understood. The implementation of the NIS Directive in the  railway sector varies between the MS and the OES. Concerning the transposition of the NIS  Directive, each MS has adopted its own way of defining essential services, identifying Operators  of Essential Services (OES), assigning national or sectorial competent authorities and defining  the acceptable means for compliance with the Directive.  Furthermore, each OES has its own way of implementing security measures, according to its  cybersecurity maturity, digital skills, size, business challenges, suppliers and the resources  allocated to cybersecurity.  The overall trend shows that the security measures identified by the Cooperation Group for the  NIS Directive are relevant to the railway stakeholders who responded to the study, and that the  majority of security measures appear to have been in place.  5.1 SECURITY MEASURES  The security measures most widely implemented by OES are the following:   cybersecurity basics (e.g. administrative accounts, security policy, logging, traffic  filtering),   measures beyond the requirements of cybersecurity (particularly for railway operations,  such as business continuity),   legal requirements such as safety and physical security (e.g. physical and  environmental safety, crisis management, incident reporting).  5.2 CONSIDERATIONS  Security measures requiring special cybersecurity expertise and strict cybersecurity governance  are more complex to implement (e.g. cryptography, industrial control systems, log correlation  and analysis). This must be adapted according to the type of system (IT or OT). It is often  impossible to fully enforce even the simplest security measures on OT systems. When OES in  the railway sector enforce the NIS Directive, they have to deal with the following challenges:   an overall low digital and cybersecurity awareness in the railway sector in the railway  sector, coupled with conflicts between safety and security mind-sets,   the characteristics of railway infrastructure and the OT environment (dependence on  the supply chain, geographic spread of railway infrastructure, legacy systems),   a growing need in the transport sector to strike a balance between cybersecurity,  competiveness and operational efficiency, combined with the on-going digital  transformation of railway, and   the complexity and lack of harmonization of cybersecurity regulations, which must be  fully understood to be put into practice.  RAILWAY CYBERSECURITY  November 2020  42  5.3 NEXT STEPS  Trying to address some of the challenges described above, several European initiatives take  place.  Standardization  At the standardization front, CENELEC’s Technical Committee 9X “Electrical and electronic  applications for railways” is finalising the European technical specification TS 50701, which aims  to introduce the requirements as well as provide recommendations for addressing cybersecurity  within the railway sector. ERTMS technical specifications update is been considered to include  stronger cybersecurity, taking as a priority enhancing the security of communication interfaces  between different components.  Policy  On the policy side, the NIS Directive and national implementations are undergoing continuous  review. The European Commission and the Member states, with the assistance of ENISA, are  working towards addressing the challenges identified above, especially those that relate to the  policy and regulatory context. At the same time, the implementation of minimum security  measures by OES is monitored by the Member states with the aim to identify potential  improvements and areas where OES require further support. This report supports this activity  and highlights rail-specific sectorial challenges.  Change of mind-set  Cybersecurity practices in the rail sector are evolving. Cybersecurity is slowly being integrated  into the design of IT and OT for transport systems. Cybersecurity culture builds up among rail  stakeholders, both OES and their suppliers. This is an indication of the way forward and of a  grand change of mind-set; cybersecurity becomes a vital requirement for the rail transport  sector.  RAILWAY CYBERSECURITY  November 2020  43  APPENDIX  Table 5: Main EU Directives and Railway Packages  Year Name Description  February 2001  First Railway  Package48  Three directives (2001/12/EC49, 2001/13/EC50 and 2001/14/EC51)  known as the \"railway infrastructure package\", were adopted to give  railway operators access to the trans-European network on a non- discriminatory basis. These Directives concern the development of  the Community’s railways, the licensing of railway undertakings, the  allocation of railway infrastructure capacity and the levying of  charges for the use of railway infrastructure and safety certification.  2002-2004  Second Railway  Package52  Based on the “White Paper: a strategy for revitalising the  Community’s railways”53, this second package (Directives  2004/49/EC54, 2004/50/EC55 and 2004/51/EC56 and Regulation (EC)  No 881/200457) presented new measures to improve and accelerate  safety, interoperability and open up the rail freight market. It  introduced common procedures for accident investigation and  established safety authorities in each member state.  April 2004  Regulation (EC)  No 881/200458  Through this regulation, the European Commission established a  European railway agency (\"Agency Regulation\")59. Its objective is “to  contribute, on technical matters, to the implementation of the  European Union’s legislation aimed at improving the competitive  position of the railway sector, by enhancing the level of  interoperability of railway systems and developing a common  approach to safety on the European railway system”.

This includes in particular but is not limited to  interfaces between the CIS and third parties.  Information  System  Security  Governance &  Risk  Management  Human resource  security  The established information system security policies set up a  CIS security awareness raising program for all staff and a  security training program for employees with CIS related  responsibilities.  Information  system security  indicators  For each CIS and according to a number of indicators and  assessment methods, the operator evaluates its compliance  with its ISSP. Indicators may relate to the risk management  organization’s performance, the maintaining of resources in  secure conditions, users’ access rights, authenticating  access to resources, and resource administration.  Information  system security  risk analysis  The operator conducts and regularly updates a risk analysis,  identifying its Critical Information Systems (CIS)  underpinning the provision of the essential services of OES  and identifies the main risks to these CIS.  Information  system security  audit  The operator establishes and updates a policy and  procedures for performing information system security  assessments and audits of critical assets and CIS, taking  into account the regularly updated risks analysis.  Information  system security  accreditation  Building on the risk analysis and according to an  accreditation process  referred to in the ISSP, the operator  accredits the CIS identified in its information system risk  analysis, including inter alia the inventory and architecture of  the administration components of the CIS.  Information  system security  policy  Building upon the risks analysis, the operator establishes,  maintains up-to-date and implements an information system  security policy (ISSP) approved by senior management,  guaranteeing high level endorsement of the policy.

November 2020  8  EXECUTIVE SUMMARY  The railway sector enables goods and passengers to be transported within countries and across  borders, and is key to the development of the European Union. The main players within this  sector are the railway undertakings (RU), in charge of providing services for the transport of  goods and/or passengers by rail; and the infrastructure managers (IM), in charge of  establishing, managing and maintaining railway infrastructure and fixed installation, including  traffic management, control-command and signalling, but also station operation and train power  supply. Both are in the scope of the NIS Directive, and their identification as operator of  essential service (OES) respects the transposition of laws to the majority of member states.  Trends  According to surveys and interviews conducted under this study, overall trends for the  implementation of the NIS Directive for operator of essential service (OES) in the railway sector  are as follows:   The general implementation of security measures regarding governance and the  ecosystem is heterogeneous and low compared to other types of measures. Most  mature OES have already been applying these measures for a long time. Meanwhile  for less mature OES, implementation of these measures has just started.   Protective security measures seem to be the best implemented. While cybersecurity  basics appear to be already implemented, security measures requiring advanced  technical expertise show a lower level of implementation. In the special context of  operational technology (OT) (legacy, number of systems, dependence on suppliers,  safety concerns), it is often impossible to implement security basics without applying  compensating countermeasures,   For defensive security measures1, the simplest security measures (e.g.  communications with competent authorities and computer security incident response  teams) seem to be well implemented. Others, however, are rarely or not implemented,  as they require considerable cybersecurity expertise and maturity (e.g. log correlation  and analysis),   For resilience measures, the level of implementation appears to be good. Managing  crises and incidents is part of the daily business of the railway sector. However, this  must be qualified: there are still opportunities to improve the full integration of new  cybersecurity threats into existing processes for dealing with crises and ensuring  resilience.  Challenges  The study also identifies the main challenges faced by the sector to enforce the NIS Directive:   Railway stakeholders must strike a balance between operational requirements,  business competitiveness and cybersecurity, while the sector is undergoing digital  transformation which increases the need for cybersecurity.   Railway stakeholders depend on suppliers with disparate technical standards and  cybersecurity capabilities, especially for operational technology.  1 See NIS Directive Cooperation Group Publication 01/2018 - Reference document on security measures for Operators of  Essential Services http://ec.europa.eu/newsroom/dae/document.cfm?doc_id=53643  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/nis-directive/minimum-security-measures-for-operators-of-essentials-services  http://ec.europa.eu/newsroom/dae/document.cfm?doc_id=53643 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/nis-directive/minimum-security-measures-for-operators-of-essentials-services  RAILWAY CYBERSECURITY  November 2020  9   OT systems for railways have been based on systems that were at a point in time  secure according to the state-of-the art but due to the long lifetime of systems they  eventually become outdated or obsolete. This makes it difficult to keep them up-to-date  with current cybersecurity requirements. Furthermore, these systems are usually  spread across the network (stations, track, etc.), making it difficult to comprehensively  control cybersecurity.   Railway operators report issues of low cybersecurity awareness and differences in  culture, especially among safety and operations personnel.   Existing rail specific regulation doesn’t include cybersecurity provisions. OES often  have to comply with non-harmonized cybersecurity requirements deriving from different  regulations.  ERTMS is also covered in this study as a separate infrastructure due to its special requirements  and its cross-European nature.  Finally, trying to address some of the challenges described above, several European initiatives  which are presented in this report take place. ENISA is teaming up with the European Railway  Agency and the overall Railway community to bring these activities in the forefront.  RAILWAY CYBERSECURITY  November 2020  10  1. INTRODUCTION  Representing 472 billion passenger-kilometres2, 216,000 km of active railways3 and 430 billion  tonne-kilometres4 for freight transport, the railway sector plays an important and fast-growing  role. Railway infrastructure and systems are key assets, crucial to developing and protecting the  European Union.  The railway sector is undergoing a major transformation of its operations, systems and  infrastructure due to the digitisation of OT and IT systems and infrastructure, the automation of  railway processes, the issues of mass transit and the increasing numbers of interconnections  with external and multimodal systems. This sector is also evolving as it gradually opens up to  competition. This leads to the reallocation of responsibilities and the separation of railway  systems and infrastructure, which also affect IT systems.  In this context, it is becoming even more crucial for the railway sector to tackle cyber threats.  1.1 POLICY AND REGULATORY CONTEXT  Several bodies define and enforce regulations for the railway sector at International, EU or  national levels. Figure 1: Regulators overview presents the main stakeholders.  Figure 1: Regulators overview  2 See https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/Railway_passenger_transport_statistics_- _quarterly_and_annual_data  3 Knapčíková, Lucia & Konings, Rob.

At international level, the first initiative concerning the railway sector was the creation of the  International Union of Railways (UIC)5 in 1922, with 194 members across 5 continents. Today it  plays an important role in standardising and classifying railways through its UIC Codes6,  facilitating the sharing of best practice, promoting interoperability and developing skill centres.  Moreover, the first and unprecedented regulatory framework was the Convention Concerning  International Carriage by Rail (COTIF)7 of 9 May 1980, amended by the Vilnius Protocol of 3  June 1999 (\"the Accession Agreement\"), which resulted in the creation of the Intergovernmental  Organisation for Carriage by Rail (OTIF) with, in 2019, 51 members (the European Union  acceded to COTIF in 2011)8. The objectives are to develop uniform laws and rules for the  carriage of passengers and freight by rail, through technical functional requirements and model  contracts.  At European level, to develop a competitive railway transport system, promote the Single  European Railway Area and align with international regulations, the European Commission has  enforced several directives – mostly in four railway legislation packages listed in the Appendix  (Table 5). To fulfil these objectives, three main priorities have been defined:   opening the railway transport market up to competition,   improving the interoperability and safety of national networks, and   developing railway infrastructure.  However, the existing regulatory framework described above does not fully consider security,  particularly the cybersecurity issues specific to the railway sector. Over the past few years, the  European Commission has enforced directives and regulations regarding cybersecurity, but  which are applicable to all markets and sectors, described in the Table 6 (in the appendix at the  end of the document).  Directive 2016/1148 (NIS Directive) is the first legislative document focusing on cybersecurity,  extending the scope also to the railway sector. The following Operators of Essential Services  (OES) are identified:   Infrastructure managers as defined in point (2) of Article 3 of Directive  2012/34/EU9 namely: “any person or firm responsible in particular for establishing,  managing and maintaining railway infrastructure, including traffic management and  control-command and signalling. The functions of the infrastructure manager on a  network or part of a network may be allocated to different bodies or firms”.   Railway undertakings as defined in point (1) of Article 3 of Directive 2012/34/EU  namely “any public or private undertaking licensed according to this Directive, the  principal business of which is to provide services for the transport of goods and/or  passengers by rail with a requirement that the undertaking ensures traction. This  also includes undertakings which provide traction only”;  o including operators of service facilities as defined in point (12) of Article  3 of Directive 2012/34/EU namely “any public or private entity responsible  5 See https://uic.org/  6 The company code (also called RICS: \"Railway Interchange Coding System\" or railway code) is a 4 digit code used in  various applications to identify a company involved in the railway business.  7 See https://otif.org/fr/?page_id=172  8 See https://otif.org/en/?page_id=53  9 See https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:32012L0034&from=FR  https://uic.org/ https://otif.org/fr/?page_id=172 https://otif.org/en/?page_id=53 https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:32012L0034&from=FR  RAILWAY CYBERSECURITY  November 2020  12  for managing one or more service facilities or supplying one or more  services to railway undertakings”  In 2018, the UIC launched several events and publications to address cybersecurity issues in  the railway sector (e.g. Guidelines for Cyber-Security in Railways)10. Moreover, the Shift2Rail  Joint Undertaking11 was launched under the Horizon 2020 programme to seek focused  research and innovation (R&I) and market-driven solutions and promote competitiveness in the  European railway industry. The initiative included cybersecurity issues in the railway sector, for  example,  under the CYRAIL (CYbersecurity in the RAILway sector) project12, or under the  X2Rail-113 project and X2Rail-314 projects which included cybersecurity work packages.  1.2 STUDY SCOPE  This study regards the level of implementation of cybersecurity measures in the railway sector,  within the context of the enforcement of the NIS Directive in each European Member State. The  stakeholders involved in the scope of this study are European infrastructure managers (IM) and  railway undertakings (RU).  1.3 STUDY OBJECTIVES  The main objective of the study is to share a preliminary analysis of the level of maturity of the  railway sector regarding the implementation of security measures enforced by the NIS Directive.  An additional important element of the study is to identify the cybersecurity challenges that OES  in the railway sector face when applying these measures. Finally, this study takes a closer look  at cybersecurity for the European Railway Traffic Management System (ERTMS), because  some OES have already integrated parts of their services into ERTMS.  1.4 TARGET AUDIENCE  The main target audience for this study is composed of professionals in charge of IT and OT  security in the railway sector: railway undertakings (RU) and infrastructure managers (IM), or  any other stakeholders involved in the enforcement of security measures.  1.5 METHODOLOGICAL APPROACH  An online survey addressing cybersecurity issues was sent to stakeholders of the European  railway sector (railway undertakings and infrastructure managers).  The survey collected 41 answers, including 29 answers from OES (71%), representing 21  member states (Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Croatia, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia,  Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Poland,  Portugal, Romania, Spain, Sweden) and Norway. 48% of the respondents are infrastructure  managers, 24% are railway undertakings and 28% are organisations that have both roles. The  non-OES respondents (12 in total, 29%) represent certification bodies, companies from the  railway manufacturing industry, governmental bodies and authorities, or railway undertakings  and infrastructure managers that are not identified as OES, e.g. operating in countries such as  the Netherlands, and Norway.  10 See https://uic.org/IMG/pdf/uic_activity_report_2018.pdf  11 See https://shift2rail.org  12 See https://cyrail.eu/  13 X2Rail-1, Start-up activities for Advanced Signalling and Automation Systems,  https://projects.shift2rail.org/s2r_ip2_n.aspx?p=X2RAIL-1  14 X2Rail-3, Advanced Signalling, Automation and Communication System (IP2 and IP5) – Prototyping the future by means  of capacity increase, autonomy and flexible communication, https://projects.shift2rail.org/s2r_ip2_n.aspx?p=X2RAIL-3  https://uic.org/IMG/pdf/uic_activity_report_2018.pdf https://shift2rail.org/ https://cyrail.eu/  RAILWAY CYBERSECURITY  November 2020  13  Based on the survey answers, 14 OES were interviewed in order to understand their priorities  with respect to cybersecurity, challenges in implementing security measures and their  relationship with their competent national authority regarding the NIS Directive. The information  collected from the survey and interviews was analysed thoroughly and completed from desk  research to draft the report.  1.6 STRUCTURE OF THE REPORT  The report is structured as follows:   analysis of the policy and regulatory context of railways, particularly cybersecurity  for rail,   identification of status regarding the transposition of the NIS directive to EU  countries, especially the railway sector,   identification of essential services and critical information systems for the railway  sector, based on answers from the survey and interviews,   maturity assessment of the sector concerning implementation of the NIS directive,  based on answers from the survey and interviews,   a focus on European Railway Traffic Management System, the most critical  services and information system for the railway sector in Europe.  Figure 2: Survey respondents  RAILWAY CYBERSECURITY  November 2020  14  2. THE RAILWAY SECTOR  To date, the railway sector does not seem to have been a direct target for cyber criminals,  however several cyberattacks and incidents have taken place indicating the vulnerability of the  sector. Below a detailed list (not extensive) of the most referenced ones is presented (always  with a focus on the EU). Note that no OT and IT combined related incidents have occurred to  this day (based on publicly available information at the time of editing).   2015, Ukraine - DoS attack. An advanced persistent threat (APT) actor carried out a  large-scale coordinated attack to destabilize the Ukrainian government by targeting  power stations, mining and railway infrastructure. The aim of these attacks was to  paralyse public and critical infrastructure by disabling industrial control systems  (ICS).15   July 2015-2016, United Kingdom - Intrusion. Between July 2015 and July 2016, four  cyberattacks were discovered on the UK railway network. After analysis, these attacks  were considered as part of a reconnaissance operation before an APT (Advanced  Persistent Threat) attack, probably led by a national state threat actor. No disruption or  modification of data was detected. 16   May 2017, Germany - Ransomware. Deutsche Bahn was a victim of the WannaCry  ransomware. Some devices were corrupted and due to this could show no information  to the passengers anymore. Train operation was not disrupted17.   October 2017, Sweden - DoS attack.  The first attack took place on 11th of October,  affecting the Sweden Transport Administration (Trafikverket) via its two internet service  providers, TDC and DGC. The DDoS attack reportedly affected the IT system that  monitors trains' locations. It also took down the federal agency's email system,  website, and road traffic maps. Customers during this time were unable to make  reservations or receive updates on the delays. As a result, train traffic and other  services reportedly had to be managed manually, using back-up processes. The next  day, a second DDoS attack impacted the website of the Swedish Transport Agency, a  separate governmental body responsible for regulating and inspecting transportation  systems. It also affected Western Sweden public transport operator Vasttrafik,  reportedly crashing its ticket booking app and online travel planning service18.   May 2018, Denmark - DDoS. A DDoS attack impacted the ticketing systems of DSB.  The Danish travellers could not purchase tickets from ticket machines, the online  application, website and certain station kiosks. DSB estimated that approximately  15,000 customers were affected19.   March 2020, United Kingdom - Data breach. The email addresses and travel details  of about 10.000 people who used the free Wi-Fi provided UK railway stations have  been exposed online. Network Rail and the service provider C3UK confirmed the  incident. The database contained 146 million records, including personal contact  details and dates of birth. A breach involved the app ‘Indian Rail’ which is a top app on  the Apple App Store. It was due to an exposed Firebase database. The breach  contained 2.357.684 rows of emails, usernames and plain-text passwords20.  15 See https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-38573074  16 See https://news.sky.com/story/four-cyber-attacks-on-uk-railways-in-a-year-10498558  17 See https://www.reuters.com/article/us-cyber-attack-germany-rail-idUSKBN1890DM  18 See https://www.scmagazineuk.com/ddos-attacks-delay-trains-halt-transportation-services-sweden/article/1473963  19 See http://cphpost.dk/news/hackers-target-danish-train-service-over-the-weekend.html  20 See https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-51682280  https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-38573074 https://news.sky.com/story/four-cyber-attacks-on-uk-railways-in-a-year-10498558 https://www.reuters.com/article/us-cyber-attack-germany-rail-idUSKBN1890DM https://www.scmagazineuk.com/ddos-attacks-delay-trains-halt-transportation-services-sweden/article/1473963 http://cphpost.dk/news/hackers-target-danish-train-service-over-the-weekend.html https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-51682280  RAILWAY CYBERSECURITY  November 2020  15   May 2020, Switzerland - Malware. Swiss rail vehicle manufacturer Stadler was hit by  a malware attack that impacted all of its locations and may have allowed attackers to  steal sensitive company data. After compromising Stadler systems, attackers  reportedly infected its systems with malware that was then used to exfiltrate sensitive  corporate data from breached systems. Internal documents stolen during the cyber-  attack on Stadler’s headquarters have been published online after the manufacturer  refused to give in to ransom demands. 21   July 2020, Spain - Ransomware. Spanish Infrastructure Manager ADIF has been hit  by a ransomware not affecting critical infrastructure but exposing gigabytes of personal  and business data22.  2.1 RAILWAY STAKEHOLDERS  The rail ecosystem is well defined and organised, with several roles and responsibilities shared  between the stakeholders. The table and figure below depict and describe the ecosystem  actors.  Table 1: Descriptions of stakeholders  Stakeholder Description  Infrastructure  Manager  In Directive 2012/34/EU, the European Union defines an infrastructure manager as “any  person or firm responsible particularly for establishing, managing and maintaining railway  infrastructure, including traffic management and control-command and signalling. The  functions of the infrastructure manager on a network or part of a network may be  allocated to different bodies or firms”.  Railway  Undertakings  In Directive 2012/34/EU, the European Union defines a railway undertaking as “any public  or private undertaking licensed according to this Directive, the principal business of which  is to provide services for the transport of goods and/or passengers by rail with a  requirement that the undertaking ensure traction. This also includes undertakings which  provide traction only”.  Supply chain  Supply chain stakeholders provide railway and IT/OT assets to RUs and IMs. They may  be vendors of trains, ICS systems, IT systems, etc. The railway sector is dependent on  these suppliers, and their collaboration is vital to ensuring cybersecurity in the railway  sector.  Service providers  Service providers can be any third party contracted by RUs or IMs to perform all or part of  a service, which could be a business service (e.g. entity in charge of train maintenance)  or an IT/OT service (e.g. IT monitoring). Service providers include advisors, works  contractors, project management consultants, system providers, integrators.  Delivery chain  The delivery chain consists of all stakeholders involved in delivering the transport service  to customers, for freight (e.g. freight agencies, logistical companies) or passengers (e.g.  travel agencies, tourist brokers). It covers also third parties who interact with the railway  for service delivery (e.g. road transport companies).  Authorities and  bodies  Authorities and bodies consist of all stakeholders in charge of applying policies and  regulations in the railway sector (e.g. railway regulators, national and European  authorities for safety or cybersecurity, conformity assessment bodies, as notified body  and designated body).  Public areas  Public areas consist of all third parties who use railway premises to deliver goods or  services (more specifically in stations). They include providers of services for passengers  (e.g. sitting areas, lounges), as well as restaurants or retail outlets in stations.  Other entities  Other entities (e.g. banks, freight insurance) have relations with railway stakeholders. In  particular, several associations or working groups focus on certain topics in the railway  sector.  21 See https://www.stadlerrail.com/media/pdf/2020_0507_media%20release_cyber-attack_en.pdf  https://www.railjournal.com/technology/internal-documents-published-after-stadler-refuses-us-6m-ransom/  22 see https://www.railjournal.com/technology/adif-hit-by-cyberattack/  https://www.stadlerrail.com/media/pdf/2020_0507_media%20release_cyber-attack_en.pdf https://www.railjournal.com/technology/internal-documents-published-after-stadler-refuses-us-6m-ransom/ https://www.railjournal.com/technology/adif-hit-by-cyberattack/  RAILWAY CYBERSECURITY  November 2020  16  Figure 3: Railway stakeholder map  Based on the analysis of the survey answers:   the majority of OES collaborate on cybersecurity matters with national bodies, e.g.  government, safety or cybersecurity agencies, ministries of transport or infrastructure,  national computer security incident response teams (CSIRTs) or computer emergency  response teams (CERTs), authorities responsible for crisis or emergency  management, disaster management, national security, counterterrorism, or data  protection;   many OES report collaboration with European bodies, such as ENISA, ERA23, DG  CONNECT24, DG MOVE25,  CENELEC26, and the European Rail ISAC27;   several OES also mention other organisations and associations that they work with,  such as UIC28, CER29, ERFA30, RailNetEurope31, FTE32, COLPOFER33, Hitrail34.  23 See https://www.era.europa.eu/  24 See https://ec.europa.eu/info/departments/communications-networks-content-and-technology_en  25 See https://ec.europa.eu/knowledge4policy/node/6657_fr  26 See https://www.cenelec.eu/  27 See https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/national-cyber-security-strategies/information-sharing  28 See https://uic.org/  29 See http://www.cer.be/  30 See http://erfarail.eu/  31 See https://rne.eu/  32 See http://www.forumtraineurope.eu/home/  33 See http://www.colpofer.org/content/cfer/en.html  34 See https://www.hitrail.com/  https://www.era.europa.eu/ https://ec.europa.eu/info/departments/communications-networks-content-and-technology_en https://ec.europa.eu/knowledge4policy/node/6657_fr https://www.cenelec.eu/ https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/national-cyber-security-strategies/information-sharing https://uic.org/ http://www.cer.be/ http://erfarail.eu/ https://rne.eu/ http://www.forumtraineurope.eu/home/ http://www.colpofer.org/content/cfer/en.html https://www.hitrail.com/  RAILWAY CYBERSECURITY  November 2020  17  2.1.1 NIS Directive implementation – Authorities  All EU Member States (MS) have already transposed the NIS Directive in their national  regulatory framework. The European Commission published in October 2019 a report35  establishing a first assessment on the different approaches chosen by Member States to  enforce the NIS Directive and develop a special focus on the railway subsector.  The report highlights the fact that MS have chosen different approaches to enforcing NIS  implementation, and explains the variations between MS. Several variations are explained, the  identification methods chosen by each national authority, the definition of the list of essential  services, and the identification of OES.  Table 2 details the different approaches chosen by MS for the transport sector and the railway  subsector, and the overarching authority. The key findings relating to the context of this report  are the following:   All member states have identified the transport sector as essential.   All member states, with the exception of the Netherlands, have identified the  railway subsector explicitly as essential.   There are two approaches to the identification of the competent authority for the  NIS Directive: either a unique national authority, chiefly focussing on cybersecurity  issues, or one authority per sector, usually the relevant ministry, addressing  sectorial issues including cybersecurity.

In particular, member states have chosen:   not to specify rail-specific essential services,   to distinguish between RU and IM, as two essential rail services,   to distinguish between separate activities such as freight and passenger transport,  or   to draw a detailed list of essential services, such as dangerous goods  management, or maintenance.  To ensure that data is comparable, and for drafting this report, eight essential railway services  have been defined and specified in the survey:   operating traffic on the network,   ensuring the safety and security of passengers and/or goods,   maintaining railway infrastructure and/or trains,   managing invoicing and finance (billing),   planning operations and book resources,   information for passengers and customers about operations,   carrying goods and/or passengers, and   selling and distributing tickets.  The respondents to the survey were asked to assess which of these services were essential for  their organisation. The essential services identified by the majority of respondents are  “operating traffic on the network” (72%), “ensuring the safety and security of passengers  and/or goods” (69%), and “maintaining railway infrastructure and/or trains” (59%).  39 See https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A52019DC0546  https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A52019DC0546  RAILWAY CYBERSECURITY  November 2020  20  Figure 4: Identification of essential railway services  The assessment of these essential services differs for each type of OES (RU, IM and OES that  with both roles). Figure 5 illustrates the differences between the services selected as essential  for each type of OES.  Figure 5: Essential services identified for each type of OES  From the results above, we make the following observations.   “Operating traffic on the network” is considered the most essential service for all OES  (71% for IM, 71% for RU and 100% for OES with both roles).   “Maintaining railway infrastructure and/or trains” is identified as essential for IM (64%)  and for OES with both roles (75%), but fewer RU considered it as essential (only 29%).   “Carrying goods and/or passengers” is identified as one of the most essential services  by RU (57%) and for OES with both roles (88%), whereas only 7% of IM considered it  as essential.   “Ensuring the safety and security of passengers and/or goods” was identified as one of  the more essential services for all types of OES (64% for IM, 43% for RU and 100% for  OES with both roles).  The results offer no surprises; they represent well the implemented split in hierarchy in the area  of responsibility of the two actors in the sector. Security and safety is a priority for the entire  RAILWAY CYBERSECURITY  November 2020  21  sector. Due to the increasing competition in several European MS, several RUs share train  operations, but only a few are in charge of infrastructure management. This makes the IM’s role  in delivering essential services for railways more prominent, as multiple RUs depend on often a  single IM.  2.2.1 NIS Directive Implementation – Essential Services  In the implementation of the NIS Directive each MS has identified essential railway services  (when railway has been identified as essential sector). It needs to be underlined that the  definition of essential services related to the railway subsector has not been standardised. MS  apply varying levels of granularity in the definition of rail essential services (detailed in the next  section).

Figure 6 represents this overview, with  systems whose responsibilities are shared between RU or IM, depending on national legislation  and policies, local specificities, historical reasons, etc.  This overview defines five categories of systems, which are presented in Figure 6 and described in more detail in  Table 4. It should be noted that the list of systems was updated at a later stage to match the terminology used in the  upcoming CENELEC TS5070144.  Table 4: Description of main railway systems  Category Systems Description  Pre-Operations  Timetable  construction  - Systems which allow commercial offers to be created for  customers (timetable for each train line) and to prepare resource  rosters (assets and staff).  Sales, distribution  and customers  relations  Systems enabling customers to buy tickets or book a train seat,  as well as managing customer relation (e.g. claims, loyalty  cards, marketing campaign).  Network allocation  Systems enabling RU to book infrastructure (corridors) to  operate their trains on the network, and to inform the IM of any  special characteristics of trains or loads (e.g. dangerous goods,  oversize). They also enable the IM to apply costing policies to  the RU for the use of the infrastructure.  Asset procurement  Systems enabling RU and IM to account for their assets  (infrastructure, or trains for example), and to procure new assets  and manage logistics.  Operations  Signalling  Systems used to direct railway traffic, such as electronic  interlocking systems, level crossing systems, etc.  Command and  control  Systems used to enable movement of trains, e.g. Automatic  Train Control (ATC), Automatic Train Supervision (ATS) and  Energy Traction system.

They include asset management, scheduling systems, fault reporting systems, resource  allocation/planning systems, document databases, fault follow-up and escalation systems.  Corporate &  support  Corporate systems are used by RUs and IMs to perform usual business. They include  email, PCs, finance, HR, communications.  Development  Development systems include everything used to develop the undertaking. They include  bidding systems for the RU or IM to answer invitations to tender for train operations or  infrastructure management, as well as all the systems used for research and engineering.

RAILWAY CYBERSECURITY  November 2020  26  Based on this overview, the OES respondents of the survey identified their critical information  systems which support their essential services. Overall, the most critical systems identified by  all types of OES (IM, RU and OES with both roles) are systems for Security and Safety, and  for Operations (Signalling, Command-Control and Telecommunications).

CYBERSECURITY MEASURES  3.1 CYBERSECURITY CHALLENGES  Based on answers to the survey, interviews and findings shared by experts with ENISA, the  following cybersecurity challenges for OES in the railway sector seeking to implement security  measures can be highlighted:   Low digital and cybersecurity awareness in the railway sector.   Difficulty in reconciling safety and cybersecurity worlds.   Digital transformation of railway core business.   Dependence on the supply chain for cybersecurity.   Geographic spread of railway infrastructure and the existence of legacy systems.   The need to balance security, competiveness and operational efficiency.   Complexity of regulations for cybersecurity.  Low digital and cybersecurity awareness in the railway sector. Overall, staff awareness of  the need for cybersecurity remains quite low, but OES report that awareness is slowly  increasing, as cyber incidents targeting the railway sector increase and become public. For  instance, after the Wannacry and NotPetya attacks, the cybersecurity teams of some OES in  the railway sector have grown in numbers, following the examples of other sectors.  Difficulty in reconciling safety and cybersecurity worlds. In the railway sector, the  importance of safety requirements is undisputable. For each update to introduce provisions for  cybersecurity, safety teams need to ensure that safety mechanisms remain intact. This requires  extra time and money. Moreover, stakeholders in charge of safety issues are not historically  aware and trained to deal with cybersecurity. This complicates relations between safety and  cybersecurity staff. Additionally, it appears to be difficult to deal simultaneously with safety and  security authorities. Each have their own requirements that may sometimes overlap or  contradict each other (e.g. managing system updates for cybersecurity, while obsolete IT  components may still be accredited for the highest level of safety). This actually indicates that  the discrepancy is evident not only from a technical perspective but in governance issues as  well.  Digital transformation of railway core business. Most railway OES are currently undergoing  digital transformation and a wide range of IT and connected devices (IoT) are introduced to  railway systems, often without being properly procured, mapped and managed. These changes  introduce new vulnerabilities and highlight the need for OT systems to comply with the same, or  even higher, cybersecurity provisions as IT systems. Network assets, network connected  devices, software developments should be treated with the same (or greater) care in the  operational field. Like IT systems, OT systems should come with monitoring, supervision and  administration tools offered or even embedded. Moreover new OT systems should have  integrated already safety and cybersecurity requirements by design.  Dependence on the supply chain for cybersecurity. OES report that are heavily reliant on  their suppliers, providers and other third parties for system updates, patch management, and  lifecycle management (supplier as a term can even include cloud service providers). Reasons  for this dependence include safety, operational and financial responsibilities, compliance with  safety, cybersecurity and technical standards, cost, and contractual obligations. RUs and IMs  rely on multiple suppliers for their IT systems, and even more so when it comes to OT systems  Railway  stakeholders  must strike a  balance between  operational  requirements,  business  competitiveness  and  cybersecurity,  while the sector  is undergoing  digital  transformation.  RAILWAY CYBERSECURITY  November 2020  28  on board trains or on trackside and OCC. Each supplier may adopt individual techniques to  satisfy similar functional requirements. This can increase the challenge of standardization and  the ability to define and implement baseline cybersecurity measures for all systems. Awareness  of the need for cybersecurity and the associated skills vary according to each supplier. This  leads to disparate levels of cybersecurity in OT systems. Moreover, provisions for suppliers are  not defined under the NIS Directive, so they have less stringent statutory requirements to apply  cybersecurity. Finally, several years may elapse between a tender process for a system and its  deployment. In the meantime, cybersecurity requirements change and the supply chain may not  be agile enough to integrate the new requirements.  Geographic spread of railway infrastructure and the existence of legacy systems. Railway  infrastructure is distributed over a wide territory shared between metropolitan areas - where  critical nodes of railway systems and networks require maximum availability, and in the  countryside – where protection and maintenance costs time and money. Trackside equipment  updates, in particular, can have an important financial repercussion.  Moreover, IMs and RUs manage many legacy or obsolete systems – with lifecycles calculated  in decades – which are difficult or even impossible to upgrade in order to implement  cybersecurity measures. Some manufacturers have even lost the technical skills to upgrade  them. Obsolescent OT requires procedures, policies and human intervention for patches and  updates, to ensure an adequate security level. Lifecycle management which covers  cybersecurity should be planned and anticipated for new systems.  The need to balance security, competiveness and operational efficiency. Rail transport is  often a public service, to be affordable for travellers. OES must keep ticket prices as low as  possible, otherwise travellers will choose other transport modes. However, OES must  implement cybersecurity measures which are costly, without being able to increase their own  revenue by raising the price of train tickets. Therefore, OES often encounter major problems  reserving budgets for cybersecurity projects. They have to tread a fine line between respecting  the budget and increasing the level of security, as in other transport sub-sectors. Additionally,  railways require nationwide investment (for trackside systems) by IMs, which also need to be  financed by service revenue. By comparison, transport by water or air travels do not require  investment all over the territory. Moreover, reinforcing the security of systems can complicate  data flows and systems (e.g. cryptography, system segregation). These can strongly impact  system performance or availability if any issues arise (e.g. expiry of a certificate).  Complexity and lack of harmonization of regulations for cybersecurity. For some OES,  understanding statutory constraints, especially the NIS Directive, may be difficult. Compliance  may require time-consuming work integrating large volumes of information and performing many  administrative tasks, as OES try to comply with cybersecurity requirements imposed by different  national regulations. Several report that beyond the NIS Directive, they have to comply with  other national laws, such as national security or critical infrastructure ones. In general, OES  recognise the importance of developing statutory cybersecurity requirements and initiatives at  national and European levels. Benefits identified by OES include awareness raising, sharing of  best practices, potential funding, and stronger requirements for cybersecurity on suppliers.  However, such requirements should be harmonized across the EU, as OES that operate in  multiple MS often face different compliance requirements. Such harmonization is key for the  suppliers as well, as they often offer products and services across the EU. Finally, the security  measures promoted by the NIS Directive are not at present specific to each sector. Some OES  have expressed the need for more flexible operational guidelines to fit the specificities and  organisation of the railway sector.  RAILWAY CYBERSECURITY  November 2020  29  3.2 MINIMUM SECURITY MEASURES  The security measures examined in the survey were defined by the NIS Directive Cooperation  Group45. They have been classified in 4 domains, and 29 security measures as depicted in the  figure below. They are described in more detail in Table 8 of the Appendix.  Figure 8: Security measures for OES  Figure 9 provides a high-level view of the level of implementation of security measures for OES  in the railway sector, highlighting the differences between the four main domains of security  measures.   Security measures related to governance, risk management and ecosystem  management are either implemented or implemented and controlled by 47% of  OES. Several such measures are partially implemented because, in fact, several OES  report that they are currently launching organisation-wide cybersecurity programmes,  to comply with the NIS Directive and other national cybersecurity requirements, and to  improve their cybersecurity posture. These measures can be particularly important as  they often are a requisite step to increasing the implementation level for all security  measures.  45 See CG Publication 01/2018 - Reference document on security measures for Operators of Essential Services  http://ec.europa.eu/newsroom/dae/document.cfm?doc_id=53643  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/nis-directive/minimum-security-measures-for-operators-of-essentials-services  http://ec.europa.eu/newsroom/dae/document.cfm?doc_id=53643 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/nis-directive/minimum-security-measures-for-operators-of-essentials-services  RAILWAY CYBERSECURITY  November 2020  30   Protection measures are implemented or implemented and controlled by 53% of  OES. Basic cybersecurity seems to be already well implemented and under control,  e.g. access control, or system segregation. However, the security measures that  require higher technical expertise, such as cryptographic controls, or cybersecurity  controls on industrial control systems (OT) are implemented at a lower rate. This can  be explained by specific context of railway OT that poses challenges to OES in fully  implementing such minimum protection security measures. Reasons include the  presence of legacy systems, the high number of systems and complexity of IM  networks, dependence on suppliers for security solutions and safety concerns when  updating such systems.   Security measures regarding defence are either implemented or implemented  and controlled by 52% of OES. Security measures that require less technical  expertise, e.g. communications with competent authorities and CSIRTs, or incident  reporting, appear to be well implemented and under control. Other measures that  require resources, maturity and expertise (e.g. log correlation and analysis) appear to  be more challenging for OES to implement.   Resilience measures are implemented or implemented and controlled by 57% of  OES. OES report that managing crises and incidents is part of the daily business in the  railway sector. The sector is already regulated for safety and security, and operational  continuity. However, these statistics should be treated with caution. Although  measures to protect operations and prevent safety or security incidents are generally  well applied, the same level of preparedness is not observed when countering  cybersecurity threats and incidents. Current processes for crisis and business  continuity management need to be adapted to cover cybersecurity incidents.  Figure 9: Overall view of the implementation level for cybersecurity measures  RAILWAY CYBERSECURITY  November 2020  31  3.2.1 Governance and ecosystem  Based on the analysis of answers to the survey, Figure 10 highlights the implementation level of  the eight security measures related to “Governance and ecosystem”. This figure is followed by  key findings, based on answers to the interview and desk research.  Figure 10: Implementation level of “Governance and ecosystem” security measures  Key findings  Key findings regarding the “Governance and ecosystem” security measures are as follows:   The measure “Security Risk Analysis” seems to be partially implemented (55%).  Indeed, when as IMs and RUs are identified as OES according to the NIS Directive,  they are asked to identify their critical systems, based on a risk-based approach.  Conducting a risk analysis is usually one of the first steps toward compliance with the  NIS Directive. Most of the OES interviewed have on-going activities to fully apply this  measure in the near future, coupled with updating their Security Policy to cover all  systems of the organisation (66% have already implemented this measure).   Regarding “Security Accreditation”, security assessments seem to be implemented by  48% of the OES. OES recognise the importance of protecting critical systems by  including cybersecurity reviews in all projects. However, it is not so easy to include  cybersecurity in all railway projects, particularly because of their special characteristics.  The construction of railway infrastructure and systems are lengthy projects, involving  third parties and suppliers who are not always familiar with cybersecurity. Moreover,  the requirements of cybersecurity regulations are relative newcomers, unlike safety  requirements which already require systems accreditation. Enforcing a cybersecurity  accreditation process seems to be perceived as a secondary step after setting up  security measures.   Defining, assessing and monitoring security indicators seem to be only partially  implemented (38%). Governance and policies must be fully enforced, and experience  on several security measures must be acquired before taking a step back to define the  relevant Key Performance Indicators (KPIs). Furthermore, it must be possible to collect  and process data from a potentially wide range of sources, which can pose an  additional challenge to OES.   For the “Security audit” measure (52%), two main trends can be highlighted: the most  mature OES conduct regular audits to check the level of cybersecurity and compliance  with their security policy, whereas the least mature ones regard this as a secondary  step, to be taken after implementing security measures. For some OES, audits of  legacy systems and others may be difficult to conduct. Finally, most OES are aware of  the measures that need to be implemented to better protect their critical systems, but  66% of OES have  updated their  Security Policy  to include all  systems of the  organisation,  including  operational  technology.  RAILWAY CYBERSECURITY  November 2020  32  they perceive an audit a waste of time and budget, if implementation of measures has  not progressed beforehand.   “Human resource security” seems to be partially implemented (48%) for two main  reasons: key personnel have been appointed by most OES (chief information security  officers (CISO) and cybersecurity project managers are already at work, there are  plans to appoint more cybersecurity experts) and awareness campaigns are being  planned or conducted. However, awareness campaigns take time to produce results,  especially in the railway sector where the core business is closer to the physical than  the digital world, and even further from cybersecurity issues.   The two security measures related to “Ecosystem management” appear difficult to  implement and control completely. 41% of OES report that they have mapped their  ecosystem and 31% have mapped relations to third parties. The railway ecosystem is  complex to map, due to the number of third parties and suppliers. For instance, for one  single system there may be several suppliers, with widely differing levels of technology  thus cybersecurity.  3.2.2 Protection  Based on the analysis of answers to the survey, figure 11 presents the implementation of 11  security measures related to the security domain “Protection”. This figure is followed by key  findings, based on answers to the interview and desk research.  Figure 11: Implementation level of “Protection” security measures  Key findings  For security measures from the “Protection” domain, the key findings are as follows:   Security measures, such as “Traffic filtering”, and “Physical and environmental  security” seem to be the most implemented (69% report that they have implemented  them). “Traffic filtering” is considered as cybersecurity basics, is already set up for  many years and every OES seem to have already deployed firewall systems and  access control policies. “Physical and environmental security” is covered in the existing  safety and security regulatory requirements and widely deployed. This shall be  balanced as the rail network is usually very wide and it seems complicated to keep a  homogeneous physical security of all local IT assets, which can be located in stations  or near the tracks;   The security measure “System configuration” has low implementation rate of this  category (45%). Indeed, it seems that this security measure is difficult to apply to  RAILWAY CYBERSECURITY  November 2020  33  legacy or old systems. As a result, most of the interviewed OES reserve this measure  for the newest systems.   The security measures “System segregation” seem to be the most implemented (50%  for both) in this domain. Most OES have already segregated OT and IT systems and  networks, but not yet tackled more advanced segregation (separating IT and OT  systems based on business criticality for example). However, IT and OT tend to  become more interconnected, so this could change the way of implementation and  further complicate the segregation of critical systems from the others. European  standards are seeking to propose a common definition as a solution to help solve this  complexity.   The security measure “Cryptography” seems to be the most difficult to implement (only  24%). Indeed, OT systems, often legacy systems, usually do not natively support  cryptography mechanisms. Moreover, this measure requires setting up complex  projects and defining special architecture for cybersecurity (e.g. public key  infrastructure, certificate management) which requires specialised cybersecurity  expertise. Lastly, implementing such measures can severely limit the availability of  systems if they are not well managed (e.g. certificate lifecycle management).   The security measures “Administrative accounts”, “Access Rights” and “Authentication  and identification” seems mostly implemented (59%, 69% and 59% respectively). It  seems the railway sector is acutely aware of the criticality of administrative accounts  and access rights. OES seem to have already set up the authentication and  identification mechanisms (e.g. nominative accounts, strong passwords, logging  registration), considered as cybersecurity basics. This is not always the case for legacy  and embedded systems, usually OT, for which such measures (e.g. complex  passwords) may not be possible. Projects are ongoing to fully implement this measure,  while efforts are taken by OES to control better such access control processes.   The security measure “Administration information systems” is relatively implemented  (52%) which is expected due to the high dependencies the OES have against  suppliers’ systems and services. This rate will rend cybersecurity configuration into a  requirement during procurement.   The security measure “IT Security Maintenance procedure” seems less difficult to  implement for RUs (71%) than for IMs (28%). It appears to be more difficult for IMs to  map and maintain their systems, geographically distributed over the national territory  with strong local specificities. By contrast, it seems easier for RUs which have to  maintain their fleet of trains (mobile systems). Moreover, due to the ongoing trend for  deregulating the railway sector, the railway market is being shared out among RUs –  including newcomers managing fleets of new and modern trains which are easier to  maintain. In the meantime, IMs have to go on managing more-or-less the same  infrastructure and systems, some of which are legacy and obsolete and are difficult to  maintain.   The security measure “Industrial control systems” (ICS) has a lower implementation  rate (38%). Indeed, usual security measures are not always applicable for those  systems, as often they are legacy systems, without security by design, and changes to  them raises safety concerns. It requires strong cybersecurity expertise to enforce  compensatory security measures on those systems and rail ecosystem has a strong  dependency on the supply chain on this. For newest systems, OES need to adapt the  procurement process to include cybersecurity requirements and involve cybersecurity  experts from the beginning, for systems that may be deployed on the network up to 5  years after the process. A few RUs also reported that those systems are not directly  under their responsibility but under the responsibility of train suppliers.  Cryptographic  controls are the  most difficult  measure to  implement in the  sector (only 24%  implement the  measure). They  require  specialised  cybersecurity  expertise, and  support from  vendors, to  ensure  availability of  systems and  safety are  guaranteed.  RAILWAY CYBERSECURITY  November 2020  34  3.2.3 Defence  Based on the analysis of survey answers,  Figure 12 highlights the implementation level of the 6 security measures related to “Defence”.  This figure is followed by key findings, based on answers to the interview, and desk research.  Figure 12: Level of implementation of “Defence” security measures  Key findings  Regarding “Defence”, the key findings are as follows:   The security measure “Communication with competent authorities and computer  security incident response teams (CSIRT)” seems to be the most widely implemented  (69%). Indeed, most of the OES communicate with the competent authorities about the  NIS Directive and its implementation. This is only natural, as communication with  relevant authorities in case of an incident is nowadays a legal requirement.   The security measure “Logging” seems to be the most partially implemented by the  majority of OES (55%), including IMs and RUs. Logging seems to be perceived as a  cybersecurity basic, especially for standard logs (e.g. authentication, management of  account and access rights). However, works are ongoing in order to apply these  measures to IT systems or to update log management (logs are stored for longer).   The security measures “Detection” (31%) and “Log correlation and analysis” (31%)  seem to be the most difficult to implement. Specialised cybersecurity expertise and  complex projects are required to deploy detection and log correlation and analysis  mechanisms  (e.g. vulnerability monitoring, identification of feared events, definition of  detection rules based on existing or feared events). This finding is even more  pronounced for OT systems, managed more generally by IMs.   “Information system security incident response” (55%) and “Incident reporting” (72%)  seem to be widely implemented. Dealing efficiently with incidents and reporting are  vital skills in the railway sector. RUs and IMS must deal with safety or security  incidents daily. However, existing incident management processes may need to be  reviewed, to fully cover the specificities of cyber incidents.  69% of OES  report that they  fully implement  “physical and  environmental  security” on all  their  infrastructures  and networks.  RAILWAY CYBERSECURITY  November 2020  35  3.2.4 Resilience  Based on the analysis of survey answers, Figure 13 highlights the implementation level of the 4  security measures related to “Resilience”. This figure is followed by key findings, based on  answers to the interview and desk research, in order to highlight the trends.  Figure 13: Implementation level of “Resilience” security measures  Key findings   Security measures “Business continuity management” and “Disaster recovery  management” seem to be partially implemented (both at 52%), for the same reasons  as incident management. In the railway sector, most RUs and IMS seem to have  already defined and tested business continuity and disaster recovery plans for safety,  security and disaster (e.g. fire or flood prevention), managed and followed up by  business teams. These plans must be updated to include cyber threats and their  evolution (e.g. offline backups for resilience in case of a ransomware attack).   The security measures “Crisis management organization” (69%) and “Crisis  management process” (55%) also seem to be well implemented. For the reasons  described above, stakeholders of the railway sector are accustomed to managing  crises as part of their daily work. However, crisis management processes and  exercises appear to concern mainly physical security and safety incidents (e.g.  derailment, obstacles on track, power outages), but cybersecurity scenarios are not  fully covered yet, and they require a different approach to crisis management. Crises  require rapid intervention by IT and cybersecurity experts, and they may be more  widespread – occurring in many stations at once - than local safety incidents - in a  specific station for example. Most mature OES perform emergency exercises to  simulate cyberattacks.  Cybersecurity  scenarios are not  covered yet on  all railway OES,  but mature  railway  organisations  already perform  emergency  exercises to  simulate  cyberattacks.  RAILWAY CYBERSECURITY  November 2020  36  4. CYBERSECURITY IN ERTMS  4.1 ERTMS DEFINITION AND ARCHITECTURE  The European Rail Traffic Management System (ERTMS) is a single European signalling and  speed control system that ensures interoperability of the railway systems, with the aim of  reducing the purchasing and, possibly, maintenance costs of the signalling systems. It can, in  some cases, as well increase the speed of trains and the capacity of infrastructure. The main  added benefit of ERTMS is to allow interoperability, stepping away from the installation of  diverse trackside systems requiring the corresponding distinct on-board systems. ERA plays the  role of system authority for ERTMS. In that respect, it establishes a transparent process to  manage, with the contribution of the sector’s representatives, any system changes.  ERTMS comprises of the European Train Control System (ETCS), i.e. a cab-signalling system  that incorporates automatic train protection, the Global System for Mobile communications for  Railways (GSM-R) and operating rules. More specifically:  ERTMS comprises of the European Train Control System (ETCS), i.e. a cab-signalling system  that incorporates automatic train protection, the Global System for Mobile communications for  Railways (GSM-R) and operating rules. More specifically:   ETCS (European Train Control System). The signalling element of the system which  includes the control of movement authorities, automatic train protection and the  interface to interlocking in a harmonised way. It allows the stepwise reduction of  complexity for train drivers (automation of control activities) - It brings trackside  signalling into the driver’s cabin - It provides information to the on-board display - It  allows for permanent train control – The train driver concentrates on core tasks.   GSM-R (Global System for Mobiles - Railway). The telecommunication network offers  both a voice communication service between driving vehicles and line controllers and a  bearer path for ETCS data. It is based on the public standard GSM with specific  railway features for operation e.g. Priority and Pre-emption (eMLPP) - Functional  Addressing Location Dependent Addressing - Voice Broadcast Service (VBS) - Voice  Group Call (VGC) - Shunting Mode - Emergency Calls - Fast call set-up. General  Packet Radio Service (GPRS option) can also be used in GSM-R networks to offer  more data possibilities.  ETML (European Traffic Management Layer). The operation management level is intended to  optimise train movements by the \"intelligent\" interpretation of timetables and train running data.  It is expected to involve the improvement of real-time train management and route planning -  railway node fluidity - customer and operating staff information across international railway  networks.  The following illustration provides an overview of the main ERTMS equipment and its  interconnections.

In future, they will be more and more transmitted on-line.  RAILWAY CYBERSECURITY  November 2020  39  4.2 CYBERSECURITY ON ERTMS  ERTMS is a standardised solution with an architecture defined in the Control Command and  Signalling Technical Specifications for Interoperability (CCS TSI)47. However, maintenance tools  and the external interfaces (interlocking, maintenance system, traffic management system  (TMS), etc.) are open and depend on the chosen system supplier. More and more systems  allow remote access through maintenance tools to the radio block centre (RBC), GSM-R, etc.,  increasing the associated risks and widening the attack vector. More and more information  management systems (IMS) require global connected systems to improve the performance and  provide new services to passengers.  As any signalling and command and control system, ERTMS has high availability and safety  integrity requirements, as these are related to service provision and safety. If we consider  cybersecurity, these are reflected on availability and integrity requirements for the ICT systems.  Confidentiality requirements refer mainly to the protection of information needed for access  control in relevant systems or to the protection of cryptographic keys. For example, there is high  need for protection of the radio block centre (RBC) in respect of its availability and integrity for  the following two reasons:   If it fails, and especially if it fails on lines without conventional signalling, it would:  o make the line nearly inoperable; trains would have to be re-directed, which  would overload other lines;  o mean that the trains on the line in question would have to clear the relevant  section, i.e. measures that would reduce the operational safety would  inevitably have to be taken.   It is, of course, of decisive importance for signalling and control-command systems that  the data are collected, transmitted and processed correctly as corrupted, untimely or  suppressed data could have consequences to operational safety.  Moreover, the communication interfaces, such as communication between the vehicle and the  track, should be protected against attacks. An attack on communication via a few manipulated  balises and their telegrams seems to be very disproportionate in view of the short effective  radius, but that does not mean that the likelihood of such an attack could be ignored. An attack  on the communication via the radio interface is more critical because it can be made at a remote  workstation and, thus, affect several vehicles at the same time resulting into a large scale crisis  (possibly DDoS attack), impacting both safety and availability. Securing communication  interfaces should become a priority for the Railway community and ERA.  This is also relevant for the other trackside elements (radio infill, euroloop, balises, LEUs), and  for the OBU: when those elements fail, it may have a negative safety consequence or it may not  allow the train to continue its trip.  The development of ETCS is according to European standards (including EN50128, EN50129)  and complies with safety integrity level 4 (SIL4) requirements. If an internal failure occurs, the  train should be stopped by the system. However, threats can impact operations and some  safety functions, such as speed restrictions. Some cybersecurity measures are already  available, but an in-depth analysis of threats, attack vectors and measures to be derived in this  context has not been conducted yet. A detailed analysis is needed to assess which  cybersecurity requirements for railway systems including ERTMS should be mandatory or  optional features, and which minimum specifications for such controls should be offered by  ERTMS suppliers. For instance, up-to-date cryptographic requirements should be specified.  47 See https://www.era.europa.eu/activities/technical-specifications-interoperability_en  As any signalling  and command  and control  system, ERTMS  has high  availability and  safety integrity  requirements, as  these are related  to service  provision and  safety.  If we consider  cybersecurity,  these are  reflected on high  availability and  integrity  requirements for  the ICT systems.  https://www.era.europa.eu/activities/technical-specifications-interoperability_en  RAILWAY CYBERSECURITY  November 2020  40  A recent analysis by CYSIS Working Group (Subgroup: ETCS and Security) works towards this  direction. It reveals that it is very unlikely that an attack on the balises will be successful due to  the implemented security functions, in case these are active. Man-in-the-middle attacks are at  least in principle possible, but only if the symmetric keys in use are attacked simultaneously with  purposively tapping of the communication. Moreover, an attack in the form of purposive  manipulation and copying of the GSM-R infrastructure is possible, but only at extremely high  efforts.  Several cybersecurity measures for rail systems like the one analysed in the previous section,  are also needed for ERTMS. Implementation of cybersecurity measures, however, face  challenges in ERTMS:   Several measures are directly dependent on ERTMS supply chain and it is difficult to  implement/enhance these measures in legacy systems.   Software updates are complex, expensive, time consuming and dependent on the  intervention of ERTMS suppliers. In some cases, those updates could even require a  review of vehicle authorisation.   Lack of rigorous tender specifications to be shared amongst OES make any  implementation even more cumbersome.  Examples of types of cybersecurity measures for ERTMS would include:   measures for the balises/loop to verify the authenticity of data, i.e. by signing the data;   measures to minimise the effect of reduced availability on the communication between  the OBU and the RBC;   measures for integrity and authenticity of the communication, especially from and to  the RBC;   event logging and analysis;   access control measures, such as “Administrative accounts” and “Authentication and  identification” security measures;   an update/patching policy for key components, e.g. GSM-R, RBC etc.;   ensuring network controls are implemented (network segregation, no direct internet  connection, no remote access by administrators, ensuring unnecessary services,  interfaces, protocols and port numbers are not activated, etc.);   state-of-the-art key and certification management and distribution; and   a scalable key management centre (KMC) and the related public key infrastructure  (PKI).  These measures are mere examples and need to be assessed for feasibility after a threat  assessment of the ERTMS is conducted.  RAILWAY CYBERSECURITY  November 2020  41  5. CONCLUSIONS  For the Railway sector the introduction of IP networks in signalling and power systems is a key  issue to be assessed and further understood. The implementation of the NIS Directive in the  railway sector varies between the MS and the OES. Concerning the transposition of the NIS  Directive, each MS has adopted its own way of defining essential services, identifying Operators  of Essential Services (OES), assigning national or sectorial competent authorities and defining  the acceptable means for compliance with the Directive.  Furthermore, each OES has its own way of implementing security measures, according to its  cybersecurity maturity, digital skills, size, business challenges, suppliers and the resources  allocated to cybersecurity.  The overall trend shows that the security measures identified by the Cooperation Group for the  NIS Directive are relevant to the railway stakeholders who responded to the study, and that the  majority of security measures appear to have been in place.  5.1 SECURITY MEASURES  The security measures most widely implemented by OES are the following:   cybersecurity basics (e.g. administrative accounts, security policy, logging, traffic  filtering),   measures beyond the requirements of cybersecurity (particularly for railway operations,  such as business continuity),   legal requirements such as safety and physical security (e.g. physical and  environmental safety, crisis management, incident reporting).  5.2 CONSIDERATIONS  Security measures requiring special cybersecurity expertise and strict cybersecurity governance  are more complex to implement (e.g. cryptography, industrial control systems, log correlation  and analysis). This must be adapted according to the type of system (IT or OT). It is often  impossible to fully enforce even the simplest security measures on OT systems. When OES in  the railway sector enforce the NIS Directive, they have to deal with the following challenges:   an overall low digital and cybersecurity awareness in the railway sector in the railway  sector, coupled with conflicts between safety and security mind-sets,   the characteristics of railway infrastructure and the OT environment (dependence on  the supply chain, geographic spread of railway infrastructure, legacy systems),   a growing need in the transport sector to strike a balance between cybersecurity,  competiveness and operational efficiency, combined with the on-going digital  transformation of railway, and   the complexity and lack of harmonization of cybersecurity regulations, which must be  fully understood to be put into practice.  RAILWAY CYBERSECURITY  November 2020  42  5.3 NEXT STEPS  Trying to address some of the challenges described above, several European initiatives take  place.  Standardization  At the standardization front, CENELEC’s Technical Committee 9X “Electrical and electronic  applications for railways” is finalising the European technical specification TS 50701, which aims  to introduce the requirements as well as provide recommendations for addressing cybersecurity  within the railway sector. ERTMS technical specifications update is been considered to include  stronger cybersecurity, taking as a priority enhancing the security of communication interfaces  between different components.  Policy  On the policy side, the NIS Directive and national implementations are undergoing continuous  review. The European Commission and the Member states, with the assistance of ENISA, are  working towards addressing the challenges identified above, especially those that relate to the  policy and regulatory context. At the same time, the implementation of minimum security  measures by OES is monitored by the Member states with the aim to identify potential  improvements and areas where OES require further support. This report supports this activity  and highlights rail-specific sectorial challenges.  Change of mind-set  Cybersecurity practices in the rail sector are evolving. Cybersecurity is slowly being integrated  into the design of IT and OT for transport systems. Cybersecurity culture builds up among rail  stakeholders, both OES and their suppliers. This is an indication of the way forward and of a  grand change of mind-set; cybersecurity becomes a vital requirement for the rail transport  sector.  RAILWAY CYBERSECURITY  November 2020  43  APPENDIX  Table 5: Main EU Directives and Railway Packages  Year Name Description  February 2001  First Railway  Package48  Three directives (2001/12/EC49, 2001/13/EC50 and 2001/14/EC51)  known as the \"railway infrastructure package\", were adopted to give  railway operators access to the trans-European network on a non- discriminatory basis. These Directives concern the development of  the Community’s railways, the licensing of railway undertakings, the  allocation of railway infrastructure capacity and the levying of  charges for the use of railway infrastructure and safety certification.  2002-2004  Second Railway  Package52  Based on the “White Paper: a strategy for revitalising the  Community’s railways”53, this second package (Directives  2004/49/EC54, 2004/50/EC55 and 2004/51/EC56 and Regulation (EC)  No 881/200457) presented new measures to improve and accelerate  safety, interoperability and open up the rail freight market. It  introduced common procedures for accident investigation and  established safety authorities in each member state.  April 2004  Regulation (EC)  No 881/200458  Through this regulation, the European Commission established a  European railway agency (\"Agency Regulation\")59. Its objective is “to  contribute, on technical matters, to the implementation of the  European Union’s legislation aimed at improving the competitive  position of the railway sector, by enhancing the level of  interoperability of railway systems and developing a common  approach to safety on the European railway system”.  October 2007  Third Railway  Package60  This third package (Directives 2007/58/EC61, 2007/59/EC62,  Regulations (EC) No 1370/200763, No 1371/200764 and No  1372/200765) introduced open access rights for international rail  passenger services, regulated passenger rights and the certification  of train crews, introducing a European driving licence that allows  train drivers to circulate on the entire European network.

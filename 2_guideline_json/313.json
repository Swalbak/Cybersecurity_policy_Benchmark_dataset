INTRODUCTION  This report is an update of the ENISA 5G Threat Landscape, published in its first edition in  20191. This document is a major update of the previous edition. It encompasses all novelties  introduced, it captures developments in the 5G architecture and it summarizes information  found in standardisation documents related to 5G. Moreover, the vulnerability and threat  assessments found in this document introduce a significant advancement to the previous  edition, by providing more comprehensive information about the exposure of assets of the  updated 5G architecture.  Beyond these changes, some additional elements have been taken into account. Firstly,  implementation/migration options of a gradual migration to 5G from 4G have been taken into  account. Secondly, security issues of operational processes have been considered. These two  changes enlarge the scope of the assessment and include important parts for the enhancement  of operational security.  For all these elements, this report provides a vulnerability analysis, indicating how these  vulnerabilities can be exploited through cyberthreats and how this exploitation can be mitigated  through security controls. The assessed vulnerabilities are consolidated from various sources,  including main 5G standardisation documents and telecommunication best practices (3GPP,  ITU, ETSI, ISO, NIST and GSMA). A consolidation and mapping of cyberthreats used in these  standards has also been performed. Clearly, the complexity of 5G infrastructure and the  dependencies of assets, controls and threats is reflected in the complexity of the produced  information. ENISA would like to develop a tool-based version of this information, so that users  of the material can better navigate this complex information in a more efficient way than the  static, highly interlinked tables presented in this report. This task will be accounted for in the  near future.  The performed assessments in this report are based on specifications of 5G infrastructure, thus  potentially having a certain “distance” from actual implementations. Moreover, assessed  vulnerabilities have been extrapolated from experiences of weaknesses of technical  implementations of similar non-5G components. As such, they comprise rather hypothetical  assumptions that are to be validated on the basis of implementations. ENISA states in this  document the importance of bridging the gap between functional specifications and  implemented functions. As 5G implementation are proceeding, it is important to develop ways to  check the compliance of implementations towards the specified content and feedback  information to the specification efforts. Initially, the creation of implementation guidelines may  be a useful tool to assess the quality of implementations. In addition, security assurance  methods may be a good way to support developers and/or entities that will test the compliance  of implemented 5G functions.  A good method to overcome these limitations and at the same to further advance the quality of  this and other relevant material (ENISA, European Commission, Member States, 3GPP,  BEREC, etc.) is to use it within detailed 5G threat/risk assessments in a coordinated manner.  Besides validation of the produced information, such actions will contribute towards a more  secure 5G infrastructure and have as consequence the creation of a competitive advantage of  European stakeholders in the area of 5G. At the same time, it will increase efficiency of used  resources by avoiding duplication of efforts.  1 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/enisa-threat-landscape-for-5g-networks, accessed October 2020.  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/enisa-threat-landscape-for-5g-networks  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE FOR 5G NETWORKS  December 2020  9  The authoring of this report has been performed exclusively by ENISA. It is based on Open  Source Intelligence (OSINT) collection of publicly available information. Following a desk-top  analysis of this material by an external contractor, an update of the 5G architecture has been  performed by ENISA, vulnerabilities have been collected and consolidated and threat exposure  has been assessed. Mitigation controls found in publicly available documents have been  associated to the identified exposure, leading to a reduction of attack surface. An ad-hock  expert group consisting of 5G experts has contributed on an ad-personam basis and has  supported the work of ENISA. Their contributions were towards information collection and  knowledge transfer in the subject matter. Their contributions has been considered and compiled  by ENISA using it as an input.  For the time being, the material presented in this report aims at supporting various stakeholders  understanding the relevant vulnerabilities and cyberthreats resulting to an exposure of 5G  assets by exploiting the vulnerabilities. When requested, ENISA is in the position to support  stakeholders ‘drilling down’ the analysis further, by including granular details from the  components in focus, and examine the relevance of the assessed cyberthreats and the  efficiency of developed security measures.  1.1 POLICY CONTEXT  In January 2020, the European Commission has issued a communication calling Member  States to take steps to implement the set of measures recommended in the 5G toolbox2,3. In  June 2020, a “Report on Member States’ Progress in Implementing the EU Toolbox on 5G  Cybersecurity7” has been published NIS Cooperation Group with the objective to provide an  overview of the state of play of the ongoing toolbox implementation process by Member States  as of June 2020.  The present report contributes to the implementation of 5G toolbox measures (SMs, TMs) and  supporting actions (SAs). Its main contribution is supporting action 9 (SA09), stating “Consider  the use of existing cooperation, coordination and information sharing mechanisms, including  actions and support by ENISA, notably through regular threat assessments”. Moreover, by  providing all details about vulnerabilities, threats, security requirements and mitigation controls,  this document builds the basis for performing technical risk assessments for various sub-  systems and components of the 5G architecture, by delivering input to identify the main  technical “risk factors” for 5G.  Since the adoption of the EU 5G Toolbox in January 2020 and the publication of Member States  progress report of the implementation June 20204, Member States had paid increasing attention  to the implementation of SM05 and SM06. The purpose of SM05 and SM06 is to ensure  resilience through diversity while addressing risk R4 at individual MNO level and national level.  However it is essential to recognize that the updated ENISA 5G Threat Landscape report has  not been revised to the extent that it can provide Member States with guidance on how to  implement SM05 and SM06. This is due to the fact that this report does not specify all relevant  assets in the 5G ecosystem supply chain (devices, cloud and network assets) and objective  criteria for key stakeholders to assess resilience and diversity in the context of SM06.  Furthermore, the current report does not provide a set of common mitigation methods to  proportionally apply across the 5G ecosystem and key stakeholders, at national (SM06 such as  issues of number of MNO, network sharing) or at individual network level (SM05).  Consequently, it is not possible from this report to make conclusions about how to consistently  and proportionally implement mitigations across EU. Within this report, supporting actions SA03  2 https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/secure-5g-deployment-eu-implementing-eu-toolbox-communication- commission, accessed October 2020.  3 https://ec.europa.eu/newsroom/dae/document.cfm?doc_id=64468, accessed October 2020.  4 https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/IP_20_1378, accessed November 2020.  To better  understand the  cyber-threats  affecting 5G  Networks, it is  essential to know  the vulnerabilities  and weaknesses  of assets,  assessing thus  their attack  surface and how  it can be  exploited by  malicious actors.  https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/secure-5g-deployment-eu-implementing-eu-toolbox-communication-commission https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/secure-5g-deployment-eu-implementing-eu-toolbox-communication-commission https://ec.europa.eu/newsroom/dae/document.cfm?doc_id=64468 https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/IP_20_1378  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE FOR 5G NETWORKS  December 2020  10  and SA04 are extensively covered (by numerous contributing to TM01, and TM02, as indicated  in the mapping found in the vulnerability assessment).  Moreover, in the new ENISA regulation, the need to analyse current and emerging risks is  expressed. In line with this role, ENISA regulation stipulates that: “the Agency should, in  cooperation with Member States and, as appropriate, with statistical bodies and others, collect  relevant information”5. More specifically, it is stated that it should “enable effective responses to  current and emerging network and information security risks and threats”6.  Therefore, the ENISA 5G Threat Landscape aims at contributing to the EU Cybersecurity  Strategy and more specifically, to ongoing policy initiatives related with the security of networks  and information systems; it streamlines and consolidates available information on cyber-threats  and their evolution, thus supporting EU and national risk assessment activities.  1.2 SCOPE AND METHODOLOGY  Unlike the conditions of previous year regarding the state-of-play of 5G developments, in 2020  several national, European and international developments have led to a clearer picture of 5G  infrastructure developments at various levels. The 5G specification has done significant  progress, implementation options and migration paths from 4G to 5G have been better clarified,  relevant operational processes for 5G infrastructure have been developed and taken up and  specialized 5G functions for verticals have been specified. Moreover, at the EU level, a 5G  toolbox7 has been developed and pilots towards 5G certification schemes are envisaged, in  preparation of potential requests to ENISA issued by the ECCG in the future.  This situation gives a far better visibility on the details of 5G infrastructures and is a better  starting point for updating the ENISA 5G Threat Landscape. Having regard to these  developments, the objectives, working methods and scope of this report are as follows:   The material collected and processed within this report consists of open source  resources. It covers mainly the state-of-the art of the 5G specification work, white  papers and good practices. No concrete implementations of 5G functions from  vendors, operators, etc. have been considered or analysed for the purpose of this  report.   The threat and vulnerability analysis performed is based on the extrapolation of  existing threats and vulnerabilities found in collected material. In this respect,  vulnerabilities referred in various processed documents have been “reverse-  engineered” based on their relevance to various components/assets; subsequently,  they have been grouped under the various zoom-ins and reflect the assessed  technical and operational weaknesses, as mentioned in the various standards/good  practices. It has to be noted that this is a pure desk-top exercise based on assumed  vulnerabilities and threats and is not funded by real incidents. Equivalently, threat  actors assumed in this report are rather hypothetical, as no known attacks to such  infrastructure do yet exist. For this reason, 5G attack vectors have not been taken into  account in this work.  5 https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal- content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=OJ:JOL_2013_165_R_0041_01&qid=1397226946093&from=EN, accessed November 2020.  6 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/ed-speeches/towards-a-new-role-and-mandate-for-enisa-and-ecsm, accessed  October 2020.  7 https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/cybersecurity-5g-networks-eu-toolbox-risk-mitigating-measures,  accessed October 2020.  https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=OJ:JOL_2013_165_R_0041_01&qid=1397226946093&from=EN https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=OJ:JOL_2013_165_R_0041_01&qid=1397226946093&from=EN https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/ed-speeches/towards-a-new-role-and-mandate-for-enisa-and-ecsm https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/cybersecurity-5g-networks-eu-toolbox-risk-mitigating-measures  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE FOR 5G NETWORKS  December 2020  11   The comprehensive architecture of 5G developed in the previous threat landscape  report8 has been updated to include novelties of the 3GPP specification. This work has  taken into account all details that have been available in the 5G specification work.   Implementation options – migration paths from 4G to 5G infrastructures have been  covered.   A process map has been developed showing the contribution of operational, life-cycle  and security assurance processes to the overall security of 5G infrastructures.   A detailed technical and operational vulnerability analysis has been performed for the  components of the 5G architecture. This analysis takes into account the threats  exploiting those vulnerabilities and the controls reducing exposure to these threats, as  defined by international organisations (3GPP, ETSI, GSMA, ISO, ITU, NIST).   Except from generic functions developed for verticals by 3GPP, no information about  verticals per se (e.g. Transportation, eHealth, Industrial Internet-of-things (IIoT), Smart  Environments, etc.) have been covered in this report. This is due to potential  complexity of those environments and the unavailability of information due to their  early specification, implementation and deployment stages of 5G verticals.   Detailed information and security requirements for various functions and interfaces are  included in this report, mainly via the annexes detailing the assessed vulnerabilities.  They cover security requirements, mitigation controls, involved stakeholders and  references to related specifications and the EU toolbox measures. Moreover, the  threats used in various reports have been consolidated by means of the threat  taxonomy delivered in this report.   The scope of this report is in line with work developed by ENISA, in particular, the 5G  Threat Landscape in its 2019 edition8, and it also coherent to ENISA deliverables in  the area of 5G Standardisation.   The development of this report followed a ‘best-effort’ approach. The collected  information is not exhaustive but representative of the matters covered.   To collect relevant technical material and available 5G knowledge, ENISA has  maintained an ad hoc expert group consisting of skilled individuals in the area of 5G.  The selection of experts has been made based on technical experience of the selected  individuals, acting ad personam. A member of the team is an active member (co-chair)  of the 3GPP security sub-group and has acted as an interface between ENISA and  3GPP. The selection has aimed at covering detailed technical 5G knowledge skills  from the most representative stakeholder types that are currently engaged in 5G  activities.   The content of this report was restricted to components/matters found in relevant  open-source material covering the entire specification, security requirements and  research results related to 5G network functions (NFs). The presented material has  been put together by ENISA.  8 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/enisa-threat-landscape-for-5g-networks, accessed October 2020.  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/enisa-threat-landscape-for-5g-networks  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE FOR 5G NETWORKS  December 2020  12   Issues regarding Law Enforcement Agencies (LEA) and Lawful Interception (LI) have  not been covered in this document, apart from a reference in the threat taxonomy and  few references found in 3GPP specifications, both kept for the shake of completeness.   This report addresses in detail all technical aspects of 5G networks and related threats  emerging from the collected material (e.g. 3GPP specification, standards, good-  practices). It does not cover non-technical threats (i.e. geopolitical), such as threats  leading to regulatory risks or risks of interference from third countries through the  supply chain.  The method adopted for this study is in line with the methodology developed by ENISA for the  preparation of its annual Cyberthreat Landscape. According to this methodology, the process  requires an initial identification of relevant assets within the architecture before performing a  vulnerability and a threat assessment, which evaluates the different levels of asset exposure.  Finally, by assigning security controls to the exploitable vulnerabilities, it reduces the threat  surface of relevant assets.  The elements of cyberthreats and the relationship to risks are graphically depicted inFigure 1.  The report describes the different relationships between assets, threats and threat agents. In  future versions of this report, we will cover vulnerabilities and countermeasures (mitigation  measures/security controls).  Figure 1: Methodology adopted based on ISO 27005  Threats play a central role in a risk assessment, especially when considering the different  components of risks. The ISO 27005, a widely adopted risk management standard, defines that  risks emerge when: “Threats abuse vulnerabilities of assets to generate harm for the  organisation”9.  Following this methodology, we have identified assets, threats and threat agents. These  constitute the core of the 5G Threat Landscape presented in this report. Furthermore, the  identification and analysis of assets and cyber-threats are based on the study of specifications,  white papers and literature, without attempting any interpretation/evaluation of the assumptions  stated in these reports. It has to be noted, that the logical relationship between Threat Agents  9 https://www.iso.org/standard/75281.html, accessed October 2020.  Owners  Countermeasures  Vulnerabilities  Attack vectors  Threat agents Threats  Risks  Assets  Value  Wish to minimize  Impose  May be aware of  Reduce  That may be  reduced by  That may  possess  Based on  (set of)  That  exploit  Give  Rise to  Wish to abuse and/or may damage  To  That increase  Leading to  https://www.iso.org/standard/75281.html  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE FOR 5G NETWORKS  December 2020  13  and Attack Vectors has not been implemented in this document for the reasons: a) the threat  agent profiles are still very rudimentary and b) attack vectors in the area of 5G are unknown,  while any assumptions on attack vectors based on specified functions (3GPP) would be  premature.  1.3 TARGET AUDIENCE  Main purpose of this report is to provide knowledge and information on 5G cybersecurity issues  to the relevant community. This information may be useful to a variety of target groups:   Non-technical stakeholders such as policy-makers, regulators, law enforcement: this  target group may find this report useful to understand the current state of specification  work, the overall architecture of 5G, the emerging vulnerabilities and threats and  respective mitigation practices and measures. For example, the threat landscape  identified in this report may support policy actions in the areas of 5G networks, SDN,  NFV, cybersecurity, critical infrastructure protection, and other sectors/verticals that plan  to use the 5G Network.   Experts working in the telecommunication sector, such as operators, vendors, and  service providers: this target group may find this report useful to carry out detailed threat  analyses and risk assessments in accordance with their particular needs and mandate  (e.g., protect a specific number of components based on asset impact analysis, respond  to specific vulnerabilities with customized mitigation measures among others).   Businesses, consultants, product developers: this target group can draw valuable  conclusions from the developed analysis and material for their offerings (products,  services). This can have the form of demonstrating how vulnerabilities have been  eliminated by using developed defences, use of the material within customer projects, or  use the material as a benchmark for defining cybersecurity protection policies for such  infrastructures (e.g. for the development of verticals). Moreover, the developed material  can be used in developing security audits for 5G infrastructures.   Experts in research and innovation: the presented material provides a detailed view on  security issues of 5G. This target group may use this material as basis for gap analysis,  as material to evaluate the impact of research and as source for innovation actions with  regard to the further development and implementation. Finally, this target group may use  this material as a useful resource for numerous academic activities, such as teaching,  research, support of scholars, etc.  Beyond these main target groups, some individual parts of the information provided in this  report may be useful to a further number of target groups. For example, the assessed  vulnerabilities – as a consolidation from various sources - may be a valuable resource for  standardisation work in order to check the completeness of already performed assessments.  Moreover, the provided material may be used within risk assessment within certification  activities, providing information about the threat exposure, as well threat actor motives and  objectives. Finally, both the 5G asset inventory and the 5G threat taxonomy can be used as-is  or further developed by any stakeholders in performing their own vulnerability, threat and risk  assessments.  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE FOR 5G NETWORKS  December 2020  14  1.4 STRUCTURE OF THE REPORT  This report presents the results of the performed vulnerability and threat assessment work in  the following manner   Chapter 2 presents the stakeholders having a role in all phases of 5G implementation,  covering specification, development, deployment, operation and supervision of the 5G  infrastructure. They constitute an essential part of the 5G ecosystem. The identified,  stakeholders carry the main responsibility for the implementation and management of  cybersecurity controls, thus being responsible for mitigating the threats identified in this  report.   Chapter 3 presents the architectural framework of 5G technology by offering a generic  architecture. By means of ‘Zoom-ins’ it provides details of various components,  including introduced novelties and an overview of security considerations. These  details will contribute to the process of identifying the critical assets of the technology.   Chapter 4 presents the results of the vulnerability assessment of for each zoom-in. It  presents vulnerability groups affecting the assets of each particular zoom-in. It  provides an overview of the detailed vulnerabilities presented in the annexes (Annexes  C-M) of this report. While this chapter provides an overview of vulnerability groups per  zoom-in, the detailed information embraces detailed vulnerabilities, associated with  threats, mitigation controls and references to corresponding collected material,   Chapter 5 presents the 5G asset inventory. It consists of a collection of important  assets drawn for the components presented in the zoom-ins in the form of a mind map  available in Annex A. The assets inventory contains assets whose vulnerabilities have  been assessed in the previous chapter.   Chapter 6 presents an overview of the assessed cyber-threats. Interrelated threats  have been grouped to form a taxonomy that is presented as a detailed mind map in  Annex B.   Chapter 7 provides information on threat agents. It is a first approach towards the  assessment of potential motives emerging from the abuse/misuse of 5G assets.   Chapter 8 provides recommendations and conclusions drawn from the threat analysis.  The detailed vulnerabilities, emerging security requirements, corresponding threat groups  exploring them, and mitigation controls are presented in the Annexes.

The referenced material will help interested  readers to dive into further detail in the complexity of the 5G infrastructure when needed.  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE FOR 5G NETWORKS  December 2020  15  2. 5G STAKEHOLDERS  2.1 STAKEHOLDERS MAPPING  The stakeholders of the 5G ecosystem have not considerably changed since the previous  edition of the 5G Threat Landscape. However, by going into some additional details, one could  amend the list of stakeholders to include some additional ones that will have a role in the 5G  ecosystem, firstly due to the inclusion of processes in the scope, and secondly by reaching a  degree of detail that may potentially motivate other stakeholders to take action in 5G.  Stakeholders will play different roles in the 5G ecosystem. Among other things, these entities  will be responsible for assuring the security of the network at different levels and in separate  layers. According to the 5G-PPP White Paper on the architecture,10 the list of stakeholder roles  in the 5G ecosystem is the following:   Service customers (SC);   Service providers (SP);   Mobile Network Operators (MNO) also known as Network Operators (NOP);   Virtualisation Infrastructure Service Providers (VISP) and   Data Centre Providers (DCSP).  In the meantime, 5GPPP has issued a very comprehensive and detailed collection of 5G  stakeholders. The graph can be found here11. The provided stakeholder groups and the detail  list of organisation types provide the full picture of entities engaging in the 5G ecosystem,  including private, governmental and international organisations.  The major stakeholder roles remained the same as in the previous 5G Threat Landscape  edition. These were:   Network infrastructure providers;   National Regulators (NRAs);   Information sharing and analysis centres (ISACs);   National cybersecurity coordinators/agencies/centres (NCSCs);   National 5G Test Centres (NTCs);   National Certification Authorities (NCAs) and   Competent EU institutions, European Commission Services, Agencies, Bodies,  Committees and Groups (including NIS-CG, ECCG, ECSO, ENISA and BEREC).  Interested readers that would like to revisit the role of the above stakeholders in the 5G  ecosystem, may revisit the previous 5G Threat Landscape edition8.  Some additional roles encountered in the collected material are worth mentioning at this point.  The importance of these roles has emerged through a better understanding of 5G  implementation and roll-out details on the one hand, but also from additional operational and  organisational needs w.r.t. 5G in shorter and longer term. These roles are:   International standardisation bodies holding an obvious role in the development of  open, publicly available and traceable 5G standards;  10 https://5g-ppp.eu/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/5G-PPP-5G-Architecture-White-Paper_final.pdf, accessed October 2020.  11 https://5g-ppp.eu/revised-5g-ppp-stakeholders-picture-and-glossary/, accessed October 2020.  https://5g-ppp.eu/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/5G-PPP-5G-Architecture-White-Paper_final.pdf https://5g-ppp.eu/revised-5g-ppp-stakeholders-picture-and-glossary/  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE FOR 5G NETWORKS  December 2020  16   Accreditation bodies will be active in the assurance of security  capabilities/requirements of accredited entities (e.g. 5G test-labs, auditors, skills, etc.);   Accredited 5G labs taking over testing and certification of 5G related components;   Telco/5G related professional organisations/associations developing good practices for  5G cybersecurity policies at technical and organisational level;   Audit organizations developing audit-guidelines for 5G infrastructures, services and  operation;   Research organisations contributing to R&D tasks related with all kinds of innovation  actions in the areas related to 5G, including verticals and   Open source organisations providing technological support and guidance in the  development of 5G functions and services.  When assuming these roles, the entities mentioned above should have different levels of  concern regarding 5G assets, among other things carrying responsibility for the risk mitigation  pertinent to the assets of concern. Although all above stakeholders do play a role in the 5G  ecosystem, their engagement emerges on a rather ad-hoc manner in current 5G activities.  When a more systematic description of activity-engagement is available, a more systematic role  mapping will be beneficial for a clearer assignment of responsibilities and a better coordination  of their actions.  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE FOR 5G NETWORKS  December 2020  17  3. 5G NETWORK DESIGN AND  ARCHITECTURE  This chapter is an update of the 5G Architecture of the 2019 5G Threat Landscape report12.  Main source of the changes of the 5G architecture is progress made in the 3GPP specification  work as it is documented in the recent version (3GPP Release 16).  Just as in the 2019’s landscape, this chapter consists of a generic 5G architecture and provides  the details of individual key components by means of ‘Zoom-ins’, allowing further detailing of  their functionality and purpose. By doing so - besides the generic 5G architecture depicted - a  number of detailed views of particular components is being presented, namely: Core Network,  Management and Network Orchestrator (MANO), Radio Access Network (RAN), Network  Function Virtualisation (NFV), Software Defined Network (SDN), Multi-access Edge Computing  (MEC), User Equipment (UE), Security Architecture (SA) and 5G Physical Infrastructure  components. These zoom-ins have been adopted from the previous version of the 5G Threat  Landscape and have been updated according to the progress of the specification work.  In this year’s version, some additional zoom-ins have been developed, in particular a zoom-in  dedicated to implementation options and a zoom-in on processes. These zoom-ins capture  some additional elements adopted/developed during 2020 that capture i) the migration options  of 5G infrastructure and ii) a process map with the relevant processes for the procurement,  development and maintenance of 5G infrastructure. In contrast to the rest of the presented  zoom-ins, the process map consists solely of various processes. We have included this zoom-in  in the 5G architecture in order to ensure a unified way of addressing vulnerabilities and threats  for pertinent to matters related to processes.  An additional element introduced for each zoom-in are two sections, one describing the  novelties established in 2020, and a second presenting security considerations related to  components of each zoom-in. While the former provides a summary of the performed changes,  the latter establishes a “bridge” to the vulnerabilities chapter (see chapter 4).  Not all components of 5G architecture have undergone changes. For the sake of completeness,  however, unchanged components of the previous 5G Threat Landscape version are repeated in  this document. They are amended with the introduced changes (marked with blue text). This  redundancy has been introduced in order to make the presented content self-contained and  facilitate reading.  Just as in the 5G Threat Landscape of 2019, in order to deal with complexity both at the level of  the generic 5G architecture and individual zoom-ins, the details of the various interfaces and  protocols have not been considered. A short description of the purpose and functionality is  provided in a separate table for each individual component. A generic 5G architecture and the  corresponding zoom-ins facilitate the identification of assets presented in chapter 5.  12 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/enisa-threat-landscape-for-5g-networks, accessed October 2020.  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/enisa-threat-landscape-for-5g-networks  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE FOR 5G NETWORKS  December 2020  18  3.1 5G USE CASES  The 5G architecture supports the various use-cases of this infrastructure, as these have been  envisaged in the 3GPP specification. An understanding of these use-cases provides the context  of use for various supported functions and architectural decisions met within the 3GPP group.  The new release 16 introduces new concepts and changes to the technical specifications of 5G  mobile networks. The work of the various 3GPP working groups resulted in the completion of  the 5G NR specifications for standalone (SA) mode. An important feature of this release is to  leverage the LTE core network to support the expansion of the 5G Network. The release 16 is  all about incrementing enhancements for mobile broadband in various requirements such as  coverage, latency, capacity, mobility, power, reliability, ease of deployment, among others.  Another core improvement with release 16 is the support to new use cases.  This has led to an enrichment of use-cases. While the previous edition of the 5G specification  envisaged the use cases: i) Enhanced mobile broadband (eMBB), ii) Ultra-reliable low latency  communication (URLLC) and iii) Machine Type Communications (MTC), the current version  enlarges significantly the scope by taking into account some verticals. The table below provides  an overview of those verticals.  Table 1: 5G Deployment Scenarios  Deployment Scenarios  Intelligent transportation systems (ITS) and vehicle-to-anything (V2X) communications  One example of a mission-critical use case is the transport system. The use of the 5G Network to enhance  automotive safety is another focus area of release 16. It includes several enhancements in support to  cellular-vehicle-to-everything (C-V2X) communications and intelligent transportation systems (ITS). The  improvements in C-V2X specification include vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V), vehicle-to-pedestrian (V2P), and  vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communications. These are all required to increase transport safety in the  current environment but also in the future implementation of autonomous driving. Intelligent transportation  systems are another major vertical focus area in release 16. This vertical area will provide a wide range of  transport and traffic-management use cases to the network.13  Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) and ultra-reliable low latency communication (URLLC)  The IIOT is also a major vertical focus area of release 16. The introduction of 5G NR into IIoT use cases will  enable the research and innovation of a future wirelessly connected and reconfigurable factory. It creates an  opportunity to introduce IIoT to support factory automation, electrical power distribution and transportation. It  introduces important enhancements in network latency and reliability. The support for time-sensitive  networking (TSN) is also included in this release, where very accurate time synchronization is essential in  factory automation use IIoT.  Integrated access and backhaul (IAB)  To expand 5G NR mmWave network coverage the cost of new fibre optics backhaul installations is typically  high and a major challenge when deploying additional base stations. Release 16 eliminates the need for this  wired backhaul, since it introduces integrated access allowing a base station to provide both wireless access  for devices and wireless backhaul connectivity.  NR-Based access to unlicensed spectrum (NR-U)  Release 16 allows 5G Networks to operate in unlicensed spectrum that is the largest available. The existing  global 5 GHz and 6 GHz unlicensed band is used by Wi-Fi and LTE LAA and is attractive use case for  increasing data rates and capacity to the network. The specifications define two operation modes: NR-U  with an anchor in licensed-assisted (shared spectrum) and standalone NR-U with only unlicensed spectrum.  13 https://www.ericsson.com/en/reports-and-papers/ericsson-technology-review/articles/5g-nr-evolution, accessed October 2020.  https://www.ericsson.com/en/reports-and-papers/ericsson-technology-review/articles/5g-nr-evolution  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE FOR 5G NETWORKS  December 2020  19  Besides these verticals, the new specification adds more than 20 standard technological  features, including a series of improvements for enhanced mobile broadband (eMBB) and  further vertical applications. These eMBB improvements cover Massive MIMO, cell interruption-  free handover, and remote interference suppression. Moreover, introduced additional  improvements may be considered as enablers that will enhance the efficiency of 5G for a series  of further applications. The table below provides a summary of those improvements/features.  Table 2: Additional 5G enabling features for all verticals  5G EFFICIENCY  Important enhancements in release 16 features can be found in the areas of multiple-input, multiple-output  (MIMO) and beamforming enhancements, dynamic spectrum sharing (DSS), dual connectivity (DC) and  carrier aggregation (CA), positioning and user equipment (UE) power saving. The most relevant 5G  efficiency improvements are as follows:  Interference mitigation  Release 16 introduces Remote Interference Mitigation (RIM) and Cross-Link Interference (CLI) features.  Base stations can communicate and coordinate (Via reference signals (RIM-RS) over-the-air or in  combination with backhaul signalling) mitigation of base station TDD DL-to-UL ducting interferences (to  indicate the presence of interference and whether enough mitigation is in place). With CLI, devices can  measure and report inter-/intra-cell interferences (Inter-cell: when devices have semi-static TDD scheduling,  Intra-cell: when devices support dynamic TDD) caused by neighbouring devices with different TDD  configurations.  MIMO Performance  Release 16 introduces MIMO enhancements including:   enhanced beam handling;   channel-state information (CSI) feedback;   support for transmission to a single UE from multiple transmission points (multi-TRP)   full-power transmission from multiple UE antennas in the uplink (UL).  Some of these enhancements are meant to increase the throughput of the network, reduce overhead,  and/or provide additional robustness.  High-precision positioning  With an increase in the number of use cases and applications requiring accurate outdoor and indoor  positioning, release 16 introduces various DL-based and UL-based positioning methods, to meet the  accuracy requirements for different use cases. The way it is operated, the network location server collects  and distributes information related to positioning of the user device (UE capabilities, assistance data,  measurements, position estimates, etc.) to the other entities involved in the positioning procedures. Single  and multi-cell positioning also brings precision geolocation in support of ITS/V2X communications and IIoT  applications (see use cases).  Power consumption  Another important aspect of release 16 is to further reduce device power consumption in user devices. For  example, the use of a wakeup signal (WUS), a low-power control channel to indicate activity or lack thereof  in the corresponding DRX (discontinuous reception) monitoring period. Others examples include optimized  low-power settings, efficient power controls, and overhead reduction, and more efficient power control  mechanisms. Smart new power-saving features help improve device battery autonomy even in high-use  applications14.  Dual connectivity and carrier aggregation (CA/DC)  Release 16 also reduces latency for CA/DC setup and activation to achieving higher data rates.  In this  case, connectivity can be resumed after periods of inactivity. Furthermore, release 16 also introduces a  triggering of CSI reference signal transmissions in case of the aggregation of carriers with different  numerology.  14 https://www.qualcomm.com/news/onq/2020/07/07/propelling-5g-forward-closer-look-3gpp-release-16?, accessed October 2020.  https://www.qualcomm.com/news/onq/2020/07/07/propelling-5g-forward-closer-look-3gpp-release-16  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE FOR 5G NETWORKS  December 2020  20  Mobility enhancements  Reduced interruption time 0ms handover enabled by dual active protocol stack with concurrent source/target  cell transmissions/reception. Improved mobility robustness Device-driven conditional handover for single  and dual connectivity, and fast handover failure recovery.   Sub-7 GHz and mmWave;   Both inter- and intra-frequency handovers;   Beneficial to high-mobility use cases (e.g., train, aerial).  Enhanced ultra-reliable, low-latency communication (eURLLC)  An important Work Item in Release 16 was aimed at enhancing support for ultra-high reliability and low- latency communications. The main features introduced by this work item include enhancements in the 5G  Core network mechanisms, physical layer enhancements for 5G New Radio and support of New Radio  Industrial Internet of Things Mechanisms to increase reliability include a redundant transmission mechanism,  enhanced QoS monitoring and RAN support for higher layer multi-connectivity15. Mechanisms to reduce  latency and to guarantee session continuity were also introduced in the 5G Core functions and supported by  enhancements in the physical layer specification of the 5G New Radio. Finally, enhancements aimed  specifically at industrial IoT scenarios include accurate reference timing delivery, scheduling enhancements  and improved handling of Time Sensitive Communication data.  Self-Organised Network (SON)  Release 16 enhances SON with the concept of mobility robust optimization (MRO), mobility load balancing  (MLB), and RACH optimization. Specifying device reporting needed to enhance network configurations and  inter-node information exchange (e.g., enhancements to interfaces like N2, and Xn).  Concluding this section, we would like to present the planned evolution of 5G 3GPP  specification. 5G specifications are in continuous development by the 3rd Generation  Partnership Project (3GPP). Since last year’s report, the current 5G specification is Release 16,  which reached specification freeze in July 2020, with items related to Radio Access Network  due for finalisation in December 2020. The timeline of specification development is presented  below16:  Figure 2: Timeline of 3GPP specification versions  It is considered as meaningful to plan prospective versions of the 5G Threat Landscape in order  to accommodate updates introduced by newer versions of the specification (e.g. end of 2021,  covering Release 17 Stage One, and end 2022 covering Release 17 Stage Two).  15 3GPP TR 21.916 V0.5.0 (2020-07) Technical Report 3rd Generation Partnership Project; Technical Specification Group  Services and System Aspects; Release 16 Description; Summary of Rel-16 Work Items (Release 16) -  https://www.3gpp.org/ftp/Specs/archive/21_series/21.916, accessed October 2020.  16 https://www.3gpp.org/release-16, accessed October 2020.  https://www.3gpp.org/ftp/Specs/archive/21_series/21.916 https://www.3gpp.org/release-16  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE FOR 5G NETWORKS  December 2020  21  3.2 GENERIC 5G ARCHITECTURE  In this section, we present the evolvement of the 5G architecture as resulted from the  specification updates of 3GPP Release 1627. Within this chapter, the complete architecture is  being presented, whereas novelties are marked through blue coloured text in the tables  detailing the zoom-in components. Updates have been implemented either at the level of  descriptions, or as new components introduced by the 3GPP specification Release 16. At the  level of zoom-ins, a special section describes in more details the rational and functions behind  the introduced novelties. A further section describes the security considerations relating to each  zoom-in.  Just as in the previous version of the 5G TL, the generic 5G architecture is presented through  its main components depicted as labelled boxes. These boxes have been arranged based on  layers, depicting their functional role in the 5G architecture (i.e. virtualisation layer and physical  infrastructure layer). This architecture aims at providing an overview of the main groups of  foreseen 5G functionality and is a consolidation of components/functions found in the analysed  material (e.g. 14, 19, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28).  Specifically in 5G, the architecture was designed in a way that connectivity and services can be  supported, enabling techniques such as Network Function Virtualisation (NFV), Network Slicing  (NS) and Software Defined Networking (SDN), Slicing, etc. This service-based architecture  meets multiple functional and performance requirements built upon new use cases.  The generic 5G architecture presents an overview of the various components that are further  detailed and depicted through specific ‘Zoom-ins’ in forthcoming sections. It is worth mentioning  that for the Transport and OSS components, no ‘Zoom-in’ was developed. However, they have  been included in the generic 5G architecture for consistency reasons, and relations with OSS  are detailed in the corresponding zoom-ins for NVF and Network Slicing Management.  Also, as an evolution from the first version of the architecture, in this version relevant processes  are taken into account, as MNO, Vendor and Assurance processes are consequential for the  overall security of the 5G Network. The 5G generic or high-level technical architecture is  depicted in the following figure.  Figure 3: Generic 5G Architecture  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE FOR 5G NETWORKS  December 2020  22  3.3 CORE NETWORK ARCHITECTURE (ZOOM-IN)  One of the most important innovations in the 5G architecture is the complete virtualisation of the  Core network. As an example, the ‘softwarisation’ of network functions will enable easier  portability and higher flexibility of networking systems and services (Control-User Plane  Separation, CUPS). The Software Defined Network (SDN) abstracts low-level network  functionalities to simplify network management. Network Function Virtualisation (NFV) provides  the enabling technology for placing various network functions in different network components  on the basis of performance needs/requirements; and eliminates the need for function-or  service-specific hardware. SDN and NFV, complementing each other, improve the network  elasticity, simplify network control and management, break the barrier of vendor-specific or  proprietary solutions, and are thus considered as highly important for future networks. These  novel network technologies and concepts that rely heavily on ‘softwarisation’ and virtualisation  of network functions will introduce new and complex threats. The core network is the central  part of the 5G infrastructure and enables all functions related to multi-access technologies. Its  main purpose is to deliver services over all kinds of networks (wireless, fixed, converged)  .  All in all, in the new specification Core Network has been amended with some new functions  and few components, while the overall structure remained almost unchanged. The majority of  added functions are related to localization issues and implementation of location services. In the  figure presented below, these new functions have been added. At the same time, slicing has  been omitted in the Core Network zoom-in, as it is included in a specialized zoom-in later in this  chapter. The Core network has been defined by 3GPP and its structure is as follows:  Figure 4: Core network architecture Zoom-in  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE FOR 5G NETWORKS  December 2020  23  The description of the elements of 5G Core network are as follows:  17 3GPP TS 23.501 V16.6.0 (2020-09) Technical Specification 3rd Generation Partnership Project; Technical Specification  Group Services and System Aspects; System architecture for the 5G System (5GS); Stage 2 (Release 16),  https://www.3gpp.org/ftp/Specs/archive/33_series/33.501/33501-g40.zip ,accessed October 2020.  18 https://portal.3gpp.org/desktopmodules/Specifications/SpecificationDetails.aspx?specificationId=3334, accessed October  2020.

Network Slice Selection  Function (NSSF)  The NSSF offers services to the AMF and NSSF in a different PLMN via the Nnssf  service based interface (see 3GPP TS 23.501and 3GPP TS 23.502).  Gateway Mobile Location  Centre (GMLC)20  The GMLC contains functionality required to support Location Services (LCS). In one  PLMN, there may be more than one GMLC.  A GMLC is the first node an external LCS client accesses in a PLMN. AFs and NFs may  access GMLC directly or via NEF.  After performing authorisation of an external LCS Client or AF and verifying target UE  privacy, a GMLC forwards a location request to either a serving AMF or to a GMLC in  another PLMN in the case of a roaming UE.  Localisation  Management Function  (LMF)  The LMF manages the overall co-ordination and scheduling of resources required for  the location of a UE that is registered with or accessing 5GCN. It also calculates or  verifies a final location and any velocity estimate and may estimate the achieved  accuracy. The LMF receives location requests for a target UE from the serving AMF  using the Nlmf interface. The LMF interacts with the UE in order to exchange location  information applicable to UE assisted and UE based position methods and interacts  with the NG-RAN, N3IWF or TNAN in order to obtain location information.  Service Communication  Proxy (SCP)  An NF service is one type of capability exposed by an NF (NF Service Producer) to  other authorized NF (NF Service Consumer) through a service-based interface NF  services may communicate directly, or indirectly via an SCP.  As defined in 3GPP TS 23.501, Clause 6.2.19, the Service Communication Proxy (SCP)  includes one or more of the following functionalities:   Indirect Communication;   Delegated Discovery;   Message forwarding and routing to destination NF/NF service;   Message forwarding and routing to a next hop SCP;   Communication security (e.g. authorisation of the NF Service Consumer to access  the NF Service Producer API), load balancing, monitoring, overload control, etc.  UE radio Capability  Management Function  (UCMF)  The UCMF is used for storage of dictionary entries corresponding to either PLMN- assigned or Manufacturer-assigned UE Radio Capability IDs.  An AMF may subscribe with the UCMF to obtain from the UCMF new values of UE  Radio Capability ID that the UCMF assigns for the purpose of caching them locally.  Network Slice Specific  Authentication and  Authorisation Function  (NSSAAF)  The Network Slice Specific Authentication and Authorisation Function (NSSAAF) offers  support for Network Slice-Specific Authentication and Authorisation as specified in TS  23.502 with an Authentication, Authorisation and Access Server (AAA-S).  Nausf, Nnrf, Nudm, Nnef,  Namf, Nmssf, Nsmf,  Npcf, Naf, Nlmf, Ngmlc,  Nssaaf, Nucmf  These are service-based interfaces exhibited by 5G Core Control-plane functions.

The most important enhancements and  their impact on the 5G Core are presented below:  New functions are added to the 5G Core toolset, to support Network-Slice Specific  Authentication (NSSAAF), Location Services (GMLC), and enhancements to existing functions’  specification support use-cases such as cellular IoT Support, Ultra-reliable low latency  architecture, 5G LAN services, Time Sensitive Networking for Industrial IoT, Vehicle to  everything.  A significant enhancement for the Service Based Architecture is the enablement of indirect  communication and delegated discovery through the Service Communication Proxy. This  increases flexibility, allowing communication between Network Functions via Network  Repository Function (NRF) and Service Communication Proxy (SCP).  Enhancements in the network analytics exposure features is an important enabler for Network  Automation in the 5G system.  Another feature provided is Radio Capabilities Signalling (RACS) Optimization via optimized  signalling of UE Radio capabilities by introducing mapping of RACS ID to UE Radio Capability  in the network. The mapping between RACS ID to UE Radio capabilities will be stored in the  new Network Function UE (radio) Capability Management Function (UCMF) and cached in the  AMF and gNB.  The network slicing function is improved beyond network-slice specific authentication with  enhanced SMF/AMF topologies and with interworking support with the Evolved Packet System,  in view of the Non Standalone (NSA) deployments.  3.3.2 SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS  The specification of 5G Core network functions were developed as to close known  vulnerabilities in existing network. The effort is ongoing; for instance, the most recent version of  the 5G architecture specification21 further enhances the closing of a known User Plane Integrity  Protection vulnerability, by adding new requirements for the UE to support User Plane Integrity  Protection at full-rate. . The full set of security mechanisms in the 5G system is presented in the  Security Architecture section.  However, the 5G core functions rely on an underlying infrastructure of hardware, software and  processes that come with their security threats and vulnerabilities. In the NFV and SDN zoom-  ins we will address the relevant security considerations related to virtualisation, softwarisation  and associated management and orchestration mechanisms. In the Processes map section, we  discuss the relevant security considerations.  Apart from these, the following general security considerations apply:  Service-based architecture  The 5G Core functions is meant to be largely composed of applications running on general-  purpose hardware that communicate through application programming interfaces (APIs). The  21 3GPP TS 23.501 V16.6.0 (2020-09) Technical Specification 3rd Generation Partnership Project; Technical Specification  Group Services and System Aspects; System architecture for the 5G System (5GS); Stage 2 (Release 16),  https://www.3gpp.org/ftp/Specs/archive/23_series/23.501/23501-g60.zip, accessed October 2020.  https://www.3gpp.org/ftp/Specs/archive/23_series/23.501/23501-g60.zip  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE FOR 5G NETWORKS  December 2020  27  integrity of the software, especially from open-source locations and the overall software supply  chain, is an area of vulnerability. As services can be created, destroyed, and communicate with  each other dynamically, systems must be properly authenticated and communications protected  in order to prevent unauthorized execution of functions or access to data22.  Affected components: Service-based interfaces  Failure to meet General Security Assurance Requirements  The security assured by the 5G Core functions and the security of the 5G Core itself is built  upon the permanent update of Security Assurance Requirements for critical network  components such as UDM, AUSF, SEPP, NRF, NEF, SMF, AMF and UPF.  However, a security update gap between new security requirements and deployment of  updated versions of network functions in operational systems will unavoidably exist. There are  two major factors in reducing this gap: a) vendors’ responsiveness in issuing and validating new  versions of the network functions that address the updated requirements, and b) timeliness and  effectiveness of MNO processes to update operational systems to recently released and SCAS-  evaluated versions.  Affected components: UDM, AUSF, SEPP, NRF, NEF, SMF, AMF, UPF.  IP Based Protocol stack  5GC moves to an IP based protocol stack, allowing interoperability with a wider number of  services and technologies in the future. The following protocols, schemas and processes will be  adopted in 5GC:   HTTP/2 and JSON as application layer and serialization protocols, replacing Diameter  over the S6a reference point   TLS as an additional layer of protection providing encrypted communication between  all network functions (NF) inside a public land mobile network (PLMN)   TCP as the transport layer protocol   RESTful framework with OpenAPI 3.0.3 as the Interface Definition Language (IDL).  As these protocols are used in the wider IT industry it will likely lead to a shorter vulnerability to  exploitation timeline, and higher impact of vulnerabilities within these protocols. Vulnerability  reporting schemes will have to manage the increased scope of these protocols. Once located  the time to patch for vulnerabilities should be short.  Affected components: All functions  3.4 NETWORK SLICING (NS) (ZOOM-IN)  One of 5G’s key features will be the opportunity for network slicing23: enables the flexible and  efficient creation of specialized end-to-end logical networks on top of shared network  infrastructure. Network slicing belongs to the category of virtualization networking paradigm,  together with Software-Defined Networking (SDN) and Network Function Virtualization (NFV).  22 Security considerations for the 5G era, 5G Americas, July 2020, https://www.5gamericas.org/wp- content/uploads/2020/07/Security-Considerations-for-the-5G-Era-2020-WP-Lossless.pdf accessed October 2020.  23 https://www.sdxcentral.com/5g/definitions/5g-network-slicing/, accessed October 2020.  https://www.5gamericas.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Security-Considerations-for-the-5G-Era-2020-WP-Lossless.pdf https://www.5gamericas.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Security-Considerations-for-the-5G-Era-2020-WP-Lossless.pdf https://www.sdxcentral.com/5g/definitions/5g-network-slicing/  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE FOR 5G NETWORKS  December 2020  28  Network slicing can take advantage of SDN and NFV, but it can be seen as an independent  technology24.  5G system is expected to be able to provide optimized support for a variety of different  communication services, different traffic loads, and different end user communities25. A clear  benefit of 5G network slicing for operators will be the ability to tailor the functionalities and  allocation of network resources to specific customers and particular market segments.  In this update of the 5G architecture, we include in this zoom-in all interrelated slicing functions  that are located within the scope of other zoom-ins. This decision has been made in order to  have in a single picture all relevant slicing components and functions, providing thus an  integrated view.  Communication between autonomous cars, for instance, requires minimal latency (the lag time  it takes for a signal to travel), but not necessarily high throughput (the amount of data a network  can process per second) while a use-case such as augmented reality will require more  bandwidth.  Network Slicing components are presented in relation to the impacted elements of the network  architecture, as depicted in the various ‘Zoom-ins’. This cross-reference/mapping is an  alternative means for describing slice functions of 5G. The dependency of slices with the  various components of the 5G generic architecture is shown in the figure below:  Figure 5: Network slicing architecture Zoom-in  24 R. F. Olimid and G. Nencioni, \"5G Network Slicing: A Security Overview,\" in IEEE Access, vol. 8, pp. 99999-100009,  2020, doi: 10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2997702, accessed October 2020.  25 3GPP TS 28.530 V16.2.0 (2020-07) 3rd Generation Partnership Project; Technical Specification Group Services and  System Aspects; Management and orchestration; Concepts, use cases and requirements (Release 16),  https://www.3gpp.org/ftp/Specs/archive/33_series/33.501/33501-g40.zip, accessed October 2020.  https://www.3gpp.org/ftp/Specs/archive/33_series/33.501/33501-g40.zip  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE FOR 5G NETWORKS  December 2020  29  The elements of the 3GPP Slicing Management System are as follows:  Element Short description  Service Instance Layer  (Communication Services)  The Service Instance Layer represents the services (end-user service or business  services) which are to be supported. Each Communication Service is represented by a  Service Instance.  Typically services can be provided by the network operator or by 3rd parties. In line  with this, a Service Instance can either represent an operator service or a 3rd party  provided service.26.  Communication Service  Management Function  (CSMF)  This function is responsible for translating the communication service related  requirement to network slice related requirements.  The CSMF communicates with the Network Slice Management Function (NSMF).  Network Slice Management  Function (NSMF)  This function is responsible for the management (including lifecycle) of NSIs. It derives  network slice subnet related requirements from the network slice related requirements.  NSMF communicates with the NSSMF and the CSMF.  Network Slice Subnet  Management Function  (NSSMF)  This function is responsible for management and orchestration of Network Slice  Subnet Instances.  Network Slice Instance (NSI) The Network Slice is a logical network that provides specific network capabilities and  network characteristics. The Network Slice Instance is a representation of a set of  network functions and the associated resources (e.g. compute, storage and  networking resources) supporting network slice.27.  Network Slice Subnet  Instance (NSSI)  The network slice subnet represents a group of network functions (including their  corresponding resources) that form part or complete constituents of a network slice.  The grouping of the network functions allows the management of each group of  network functions to be conducted independently of the network slice.  Network Functions (NF)  Core Network Functions  (CNF)  Access Network Functions  (gNB)  A network slice instance (NSI) contains Network Functions, including the Core  Network Control Plane and User Plane Network Functions in the Home Network and  the Access Functions in the serving network28.  Release 16 of the 3GPP specification includes improved interworking with the LTE  Evolved Packet Core (EPC).  NFV MANO NFV MANO includes NFV Orchestrator (NFVO), VNF manager (VNFM) and  Virtualised infrastructure manager (VIM).  Element Management  System (EMS)  The Element Management is responsible for FCAPS management of network  functions used in the network slice instance.  Operations Support System  (OSS)  OSS functions provide management and orchestration of systems including legacy  ones and may have full end-to-end visibility of services provided by legacy network  functions in an operator's network.  Resources layer Network functions will run as software components on top of hardware infrastructure.  Virtualization enables an elastic, automated environment where network, compute and  storage services can expand, or contract as needed. Many resources can now be  hosted as software services and dynamically instantiated in different network  segments.  Management Functions  Service Based Interface  (SBI)  The management of the 3GPP network is provided by management services.  Management Services offer their services via standardized service interfaces  composed of individually specified components.  Os-Ma-nfvo The Os-Ma-nfvo reference point can be used for the interaction between 3GPP slicing  related management functions and NFV-MANO.  To properly interface with NFV-MANO, the NSMF and/or NSSMF consume the NFV  MANO interface, exposed in the Os-Ma-nfvo , Ve-Vnfm-em and Ve-Vnfm-vnf  reference points (last two not displayed in the Figure due to graphical limitations).  26 3GPP TR 23.799 V14.0.0 (2016-12) Technical Report 3rd Generation Partnership Project; Technical Specification Group  Services and System Aspects; Study on Architecture for Next Generation System (Release 14), accessed October 2020.  27 3GPP TS 23.501 V16.5.1 (2020-08), 3rd Generation Partnership Project; Technical Specification Group Services and  System Aspects; System architecture for the 5G System (5GS); Stage 2 (Release 16),  https://www.3gpp.org/ftp/Specs/archive/33_series/33.501/33501-g40.zip, accessed October 2020.  28 3GPP TS 23.501 V16.5.1 (2020-08), 3rd Generation Partnership Project; Technical Specification Group Services and  System Aspects; System architecture for the 5G System (5GS); Stage 2 (Release 16),  https://www.3gpp.org/ftp/Specs/archive/33_series/33.501/33501-g40.zip, accessed October 2020.  https://www.3gpp.org/ftp/Specs/archive/33_series/33.501/33501-g40.zip https://www.3gpp.org/ftp/Specs/archive/33_series/33.501/33501-g40.zip  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE FOR 5G NETWORKS  December 2020  30  3.4.1 ELEMENTS OF NOVELTY  In release 16 of the 3GPP specification, the network slicing function is improved with the  following features:  - Enhancement of interworking between LTE Evolved Packet Core (EPC) and 5G Core to  manage mobility of User Equipment and its allocated Network Slice between networks  - A newly introduced Network Slice Specific Authentication and Authorisation (NSSAA)  mechanism that enables separate authentication and authorisation per Network Slice.  The trigger of NSSAA is based on subscription information from UDM and operator  policy and may be performed when UE indicates support for the feature.29  3.4.2 SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS  Security-as-a-Service  Network slices are used to deploy services at the multi-access edge across a distributed cloud  infrastructure. Network slices can be configured based upon the service-type (eMBB, mMTC,  URLLC), customer, and application to provide the required latency, bandwidth, QoS, and  security. While slices provide inherent security through segmentation, slices can also be used to  provide additional security protection and security services specific to the use case and  customer requirements.  However, although realisation of Security-as-a-Service (SECaaS) offerings is feasible technically,  it would rest ultimately with the Mobile Network Operator (MNO) to include such services in the  offer, depending on its service strategy, market context, and in relation to vertical use-cases.  Related component(s): Communication Services  End-to-end security  Network slices are end-to-end logical networks, so it is natural to aim for end-to-end security.  The concept of end-to end security is closely connected to the concepts of isolation and  orchestration. Moreover, it is dependent on the business model and on the associated trust  model.30  Release 16 introduces the mechanism of Network Slice Specific Authorisation Identifier that  enables network-slice-specific authentication and authorisation mechanisms to complement  network-side authentication mechanisms.  Related component(s): Network Slice Instance  Resource isolation  One of key expectations of network slicing is resources isolation. Each slice may be perceived  as isolated set of resources configured through the network environment and providing defined  set of functions. Level and strength of isolation may vary depending on requirements and usage  scenarios for slicing.31  29 3GPP TR 21.916 V0.5.0 (2020-07) 3rd Generation Partnership Project; Technical Specification Group Services and  ystem Aspects; Release 16 Description; Summary of Rel-16 Work Items, (Release 16),  https://www.3gpp.org/ftp/Specs/archive/21_series/21.916/, accessed October 2020.  30 R.

Technically, this means high complexity and flexibility, which bring in higher security risks.  3GPP defines requirements for management services’ security that include use of secure  communication protocols for protection of interactions at the management service interfaces  and authorisation of management service requests33, but it is to be noted the most recent 3GPP  specifications are yet to be implemented.  Another relevant issue is management of network-slice-specific log information to support post-  incident analysis. Such information may include proof of transit, remote attestation, as well as  data to support root cause analysis.  Related component(s): NSMF, NFV-MANO, Os-Ma-NFVO, SBI  Trust Model  In 5G three role models are envisaged for stakeholders.  1) The MNO owns and manages both the access and core network.  2) An MNO owns and manages the core network, the access network is shared among  multiple operators (i.e., RAN sharing).  3) Only part of the network is owned and/or managed by the MNO, with other parts being  owned and/or managed by a 3rd party.  The 3GPP appropriate APIs and management functions are needed to support this extended 3rd  party access and control of capabilities provided by the MNO, and to do so in a secure manner.  The 3rd party has increasing control over the network capabilities that support its service.  However, this control is limited to what is allowed by the MNO through the provided APIs.34  Related component(s): SBIs, Os-Ma-nfvo  32 Gutz, A Story, C Schlesinger, N Foster, inProc.1st Workshop on Hot Topicsin Software Defined Networks.

Rather, it has been integrated with the  NFV zoom in. This is because the functions used for are covered completely in the NFV zoom-  in (see section Error! Reference source not found.).  3.6 RADIO ACCESS NETWORK (RAN) (ZOOM-IN)  5G New Radio (NR) is the standard the 5G wireless air interface. 5G New Radio is set to deliver  faster and more responsive mobile broadband services and to extend mobile technology to  connect and support a multitude of new industries.  The baseline architecture described by 5G-PPP referring 3GPP Release 16 specifications on  NG-RAN identifies as a main innovation the split of the F1 interface into Centralized Unit (CU)  and Distributed Unit (DU), with a Service Data Adaptation Protocol (SDAP). The SDAP  architecture includes a Packet Data Conversion Protocol (PDCP) located in the CU and an Air  Radio Link Control (ARLC) located in the DU.  Release 16 adds integrated access and  backhaul (IAB) to the 5G toolkit. IAB allows base stations to provide both wireless access for  devices and wireless backhaul connectivity, which can replace temporarily or permanently wired  backhauls.  Another key aspect of the NG-RAN is the ability to provide small-cell coverage to multiple  operators “as-a-service” in two-tier architecture. These tiers are in support of the previously  mentioned 5G use cases providing low latency services and high processing power. The  structure of the RAN architecture is depicted in the following figure35:  Figure 6: RAN architecture Zoom-in  35 3GPP TS 38.401 V16.2.0 (2020-07), Technical Specification 3rd Generation Partnership Project; Technical Specification  Group Radio  Access Network; NG-RAN; Architecture description (Release 16),  https://www.3gpp.org/ftp/Specs/archive/38_series/38.401/, accessed October 2020.  https://www.3gpp.org/ftp/Specs/archive/38_series/38.401/  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE FOR 5G NETWORKS  December 2020  33  The elements of the RAN architecture are as follows:  Element Short description  User Equipment (UE) Allows a user access to network services. The User Equipment is subdivided into the  UICC domain and the ME (Mobile Equipment) Domain. The ME Domain can further be  subdivided into one or more Mobile Termination (MT) and Terminal Equipment (TE)  components showing the connectivity between multiple functional groups.  gNB Next generation Node/Base Station is a node providing NR user plane and control plane  protocol terminations towards the UE, and connected via the NG interface to the 5GC.  gNB Distributed Unit (gNB- DU)  gNB-DUa logical node hosting RLC, MAC and PHY layers of the gNB or en-gNB, and its  operation is partly controlled by gNB-CU. One gNB-DU supports one or multiple cells.  One cell is supported by only one gNB-DU. The gNB-DU terminates the F1 interface  connected with the gNB-CU.  gNB Central Unit (gNB-CU) gNB-Central Unit (CU) is a logical node hosting RRC, SDAP and PDCP protocols of the  gNB or RRC and PDCP protocols of the en-gNB that controls the operation of one or  more gNB-DUs. The gNB-CU terminates the F1 interface connected with the gNB-DU.  Xn Xn is a network interface between NG-RAN nodes; 3GPP TS 38.42036 specifies Xn  interface general aspects and principles.  NG interface The gNBs are connected by means of the NG interfaces to the 5G Core, more  specifically to the AMF (Access and Mobility Management Function) by means of the  NG-C interface and to the UPF (User Plane Function) by means of the NG-U interface.  NR Uu The New Radio Unified Air Interface (NR-Uu) is the radio interface between the mobile  and the radio access network.  IAB Donor gNB that provides network access to UEs via a network of backhaul and access links37.  IAB Node RAN node that supports New Radio access links to UEs and New Radio backhaul links  to parent nodes and child nodes. The IAB-node does not support backhauling via LTE.  Non Access Stratum (NAS) NAS is a functional layer in the protocol stack between UE and Core Network. (NAS)  protocol for 5G System (defined in 3GPP TS 24.501).  Access Stratum (AS) AS is a functional layer in the protocol stack between UE and RAN responsible for  transporting data over the wireless connection and managing radio resources.  F1 The F1 interface provides means for interconnecting a gNB-CU and a gNB-DU of a gNB  within an NG-RAN, or for interconnecting a gNB-CU and a gNB-DU of an en-gNB within  an E-UTRAN.  It facilitates that a gNB-CU and a gNB-DU supplied by different manufacturers can work  seamlessly38.  3.6.1 ELEMENTS OF NOVELTY  While a significant part of the Release 16 enhancements involve the 5G-RAN to a certain  extent, the following enhancements brought by Release 16 of the 3GPP specification are  directly relevant for the 5G-RAN:  36 3GPP TS 38.420 V16.0.0 (2020-07), Technical Specification, 3rd Generation Partnership Project; Technical Specification Group Radio Access  Network; NG-RAN; Xn general aspects and principles (Release 16), https://www.3gpp.org/ftp/Specs/archive/38_series/38.420, accessed October 2020.  37 3GPP TS 38.300 V16.2.0 (2020-07), Technical Specification, 3rd Generation Partnership Project; Technical Specification Group Radio Access  Network; NR; NR and NG-RAN Overall Description; Stage 2 (Release 16), https://www.3gpp.org/ftp/Specs/archive/38_series/38.300/ , accessed  October 2020  38 3GPP TS 38.470 V16.2.0 (2020-07) Technical Specification 3rd Generation Partnership Project; Technical Specification  Group Radio  Access Network; NG-RAN; F1 general aspects and principles (Release 16),  https://www.3gpp.org/ftp/Specs/archive/38_series/38.470, accessed October 2020.  https://www.3gpp.org/ftp/Specs/archive/38_series/38.420 https://www.3gpp.org/ftp/Specs/archive/38_series/38.300/ https://www.3gpp.org/ftp/Specs/archive/38_series/38.470  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE FOR 5G NETWORKS  December 2020  34  Integrated access and backhaul (IAB)  One of the major 5G challenges for operators looking to expand network coverage is the cost of  deploying base stations. The limited range of mmWave signals for fiber-optics backhaul  installations to service these base stations can make mmWave deployment cost intensive. IAB  addresses directly this issue. IAB base stations provide both wireless access for devices and  wireless backhaul connectivity, thus eliminating the need for wired backhauls. Operators may  resort to these capabilities to speed up densification, and install fiber to increase backhaul  capacity at a later time, as demand increases.  Multiple-input and multiple-output (MIMO) enhancements  MIMO multiplies a radio link’s capacity by using multiple transmission and multiple receiving  antennas. Multi-user multiple-input and multiple-output (MU-MIMO) enhancements include  support for multiple transmission and reception points (multi-TRP) and improved multi-beam  management for enhanced link reliability. Improvements also aim at reducing peak-to-average  power ratio, and improved coverage at the network’s edge.  Simplified Random Access Procedure  Release 16 introduces a simplified random access procedure. This reduces the number of  interactions between the UE and network during the connection setup and connection resume,  thereby enabling a lower control plane latency. In case of connected mode, a small amount of  data can be sent via 2-step RACH procedure thus also enabling a lower latency for UL UP data  for connected mode UEs.  Private network support for NG-RAN  The second Release 16 project aimed at expanding 5G’s reach beyond traditional public mobile  networks involves improved support in the system architecture for private networks. Private  networks utilize dedicated base stations that are independently managed, implement  customized security and privacy controls, and deliver optimizations for local applications, such  as low latency or data flow control. Private networks are directly aimed at new use cases such  as industrial IoT.  UE Power Saving  UE battery life is an important aspect of the user’s experience. The study of the Rel-16 UE  power saving had shown substantial power saving gain comparing to considered Rel-15 NR  features. The work item of UE power saving in NR includes the power saving techniques, such  as DRX adaptation, cross-slot scheduling, and maximum MIMO layer adaptation in  CONNECTED state, fast transition out of CONNECTED state, and reduced RRM (Radio  Resource Management) measurements in idle/inactive states39.  NR-Based Access to Unlicensed spectrum  To expand 5G’s reach, 3GPP completed two projects in Release 16 that are key for new  vertical use cases. One of them is 5G NR-U, that allows 5G to operate in unlicensed spectrum.  It defines two operation modes, anchored NR-U requiring an anchor in licensed or shared  spectrum and standalone NR-U that utilizes only unlicensed spectrum.  39 3GPP TR 21.916 V0.5.0 (2020-07) Technical Report 3rd Generation Partnership Project; Technical Specification Group  Services and  System Aspects; Release 16 Description; Summary of Rel-16 Work Items (Release  16),https://www.3gpp.org/ftp/Specs/archive/33_series/33.501/33501-g40.zip , accessed October 2020.  https://www.3gpp.org/ftp/Specs/archive/33_series/33.501/33501-g40.zip  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE FOR 5G NETWORKS  December 2020  35  Time sensitive networking (TSN)  As part of the effort for 5G to support new Industry 4.0 use cases such as factory automation,  5G RAN Release 16 added support for TSN integration that can ensure time-deterministic  delivery of data packets.  Precision geolocation  3GPP support location service features, to allow new and innovative location-based services to  be developed. 5G specifications make possible to identify and report the current location of the  user’s terminal and to make the information available to the user, ME, network operator, service  provider, value added service providers and for PLMN internal operations40 Enhancements in  high-precision positioning brought by 5G NR Release 16, meet accuracy targets of 3 meters  indoors and 10 meters outdoors.  3.6.2 SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS  In recent years, a large body of literature has revealed numerous security and privacy issues in  4G mobile networks. Most of the published attacks at the 4G RAN layer involve Rogue Base  Stations (RBSs) or IMSI catchers to target individual user(s) during the UE’s initial attach  procedure to the network or paging attacks using the IMSI paging feature. In such attacks, the  information obtained on IMSIs may be used later for other types of attacks41.  5G NR technologies address and close known IMSI threats, but new functionalities in the  Release 16 also bring security considerations that are subject to open studies:  Security of Ultra-Reliable Low-Latency Communication (URLLC)  URLLC needs to support both high reliability and low latency. In order to ensure the high  reliability, redundant transmission in 5GS is supported on multiple user plane data paths.  Accordingly, the applicable security mechanisms for supporting redundant transmission cover  all aspect of the communication, including PDU session establishment, handover etc. As for the  low latency aspect, the other important requirements for URLLC include QoS Monitoring to  assist URLLC service and optimization for handover procedure. The security considerations in  this case are covered as well. Additional security aspects are related to control plane and user  plane optimizations for ensuring the high reliability and reducing latency42.  Related components: gNB, interfaces: Uu, F1, Xn  Security of NR Integrated Access and Backhaul  A study is underway at 3GPP to identify potential security threats and vulnerabilities that are  applicable to the new IAB architecture43. Key security issues include Topology Discovery and  Masquerading, IAB Node Authentication to prevent connection of false IAB-node and  manipulation of Radio Link Failure recovery and security of F1 interface.  40 3GPP TS 22.071 V16.0.0 (2020-07) Technical Specification 3rd Generation Partnership Project; Technical Specification  Group Services and System Aspects; Location Services (LCS); Service description; Stage 1 (Release 16)  https://www.3gpp.org/ftp/Specs/archive/22_series/22.071, accessed October 2020.  41 Rupprecht, David & Dabrowski, Adrian & Holz, Thorsten & Weippl, Edgar & Pöpper, Christina.

This  weakness can be used by some adversary nodes to cause intentional interference and hinder  legitimate user’s communication over specific wireless channels. 5G improves resilience  against jamming attacks over the 4G LTE, but remains vulnerable to customised attacks.  Massive MIMO deployment may be vulnerable to jamming attacks44. Jamming attacks are a  special concern for mission-critical applications.  Related components: Uu  Failure to meet General Security Assurance Requirements  Security of 5G RAN is built upon the permanent update of Security Assurance Requirements for  critical network components such as gNB.  However, a security update gap between new security requirements and deployment of  updated versions of network functions in operational systems will unavoidably exist. There are  two major factors in reducing this gap: a) vendors’ responsiveness in issuing and validating new  versions of the network functions that address the updated requirements, and b) timeliness and  effectiveness of MNO processes to update operational systems to recently released and SCAS-  evaluated versions.  Affected components: gNB  3.7 NETWORK FUNCTION VIRTUALISATION (NFV) – MANO (ZOOM-IN)  NFV introduces a new concept for service providers to accelerate the deployment of new  network services in support of their revenue and growth plans. It translates to the use of  standard IT virtualisation technologies applied to the deployment of Network Functions, aiming  at a faster provision of new network services. With this, several providers formed the NFV ISG  under the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI). The foundation of NFV’s  basic requirements and architecture resulted from the work produced by ETSI NFV ISG 4546.  Although 5G networks will be very different compared to its predecessors in some regards (e.g.  through the use of virtualisation and support for diverse and critical non-telecom-oriented  services), they still share similarities and will reuse and extend existing concepts that have  proved successful and are widely adopted.  The NFV has a tight interaction with Virtual Network Functions (VNF), MANO and OSS/BSS  and security management components. The NFV ‘Zoom-in’ presented in Figure 7 refers to all  relevant Core Network and Access Network Functions, as defined by the 3GPP specification  and outlined in their respective zoom-ins.  The structure of NFV has remained almost unchanged. The updates of NFV introduced,  constitute an evolution of previous specifications and concentrate mainly in the adaptation of  functions virtualization to various requirements dictated by the needs of various components.

Also, the 3GPP Network Slicing Management system consumes management interfaces  provided by NFV MANO for purposes such as Network Slice Lifecycle Management (LCM),  Virtual Network Function LCM, Performance, Fault and Configuration Management. The structure  of NFV architecture and its interfaces to related components is shown in the following figure.  Figure 7: NFV architecture Zoom-in  The elements of the NFV architecture are as follows:  Element Short description  Operations Support  System/Business Support  System (OSS/BSS)  OSS/BSS functions provide management and orchestration of systems including  legacy ones and may have full end-to-end visibility of services provided by legacy  network functions in an operator's network.  Processes covered by OSS/BSS include: Network Management, Service delivery /  fulfilment / assurance, Customer Relationship management and Billing.  Virtualised Network  Function (VNF)  A VNF is a virtualisation of a network function in a legacy non-virtualised network.  ETSI GS NFV 001 provides a list of use cases and examples of target network  functions (NFs) for virtualisation. Functional behaviour and state of a NF are largely  independent of whether the NF is virtualised or not. The functional behaviour and the  external operational interfaces of a Physical Network Function (PNF) and a VNF are  expected to be the same.  All Core and Access Network functions in the 5G system are potential subjects of  virtualisation, in certain implementation scenarios.  Element Management  (EM)  The Element Management is responsible for:   Configuration for the network functions provided by the VNF.   Fault management for the network functions provided by the VNF.   Accounting for the usage of VNF functions.   Collecting performance measurement results for the functions provided by the VNF.   Security management for the VNF functions.  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE FOR 5G NETWORKS  December 2020  38  Element Short description  NFV Infrastructure (NFVI) The NFV Infrastructure is the totality of all hardware and software components which  build up the environment in which VNFs are deployed, managed and executed. The  NFV Infrastructure can span across several locations, i.e. places where NFVI-PoPs  are operated. The network providing connectivity between these locations is regarded  to be part of the NFV Infrastructure. From the VNF's perspective, the virtualisation  layer and the hardware resources look like a single entity providing the VNF with  desired virtualised resources.  Hardware Resources In NFV, the physical hardware resources include computing, storage and network that  provide processing, storage and connectivity to VNFs through the virtualisation layer  (e.g. hypervisor). Computing hardware is assumed to be COTS as opposed to  purpose-built hardware. Storage resources can be differentiated between shared  network attached storage (NAS) and storage that resides on the server itself.  Computing and storage resources are commonly pooled. Network resources are  comprised of switching functions, e.g. routers, and wired or wireless links.  Virtualisation Layer and  Virtualised Resources  The virtualisation layer abstracts the hardware resources and decouples the VNF  software from the underlying hardware, thus ensuring a hardware independent  lifecycle for the VNFs. In short, the virtualisation layer is responsible for: •Abstracting  and logically partitioning physical resources, commonly as a hardware abstraction  layer. •Enabling the software that implements the VNF to use the underlying  virtualised infrastructure. •Providing virtualised resources to the VNF, so that the latter  can be executed.  Virtualised Infrastructure  Manager  From NFV's point of view, virtualised infrastructure management comprises the  functionalities that are used to control and manage the interaction of a VNF with  computing, storage and network resources under its authority, as well as their  virtualisation. According to the list of hardware resources specified in the architecture,  the Virtualised Infrastructure Manager performs resource and operations  management.Multiple Virtualised Infrastructure Manager instances may be deployed.  NFV Orchestrator The NFV Orchestrator is in charge of the orchestration and management of NFV  infrastructure and software resources, and realizing network services on NFVI.  VNF Manager VNF Manager is responsible for VNF lifecycle management (e.g. instantiation, update,  query, scaling, and termination). Multiple VNF Managers may be deployed; a VNF  Manager may be deployed for each VNF, or a VNF Manager may serve multiple  VNFs.  Os-Ma-nfvo This reference point is used for exchanges between OSS/BSS and NFV Orchestrator,  and supports the following:  • Network Service Descriptor and VNF package management;  • Network Service instance lifecycle management;  • VNF lifecycle management;  • Policy management and/or enforcement for Network Service instances, VNF  instances and NFVI resources;  • Querying relevant Network Service instance and VNF instance information from  the OSS/BSS;  • Forwarding of events, accounting and usage records and performance  measurement results regarding Network Service instances, VNF instances, and  NFVI resources to OSS/BSS, as well as and information about the associations  between those instances and NFVI resources.  Ve-Vnfm-em This reference point is used for exchanges between EM and VNF Manager, and  supports the following:  VNF instantiation / VNF instance query / VNF instance update / VNF instance scaling  out-in, and up-down / VNF instance termination / Forwarding of configuration and  events from the EM to the VNFM / Forwarding of configuration and events regarding  the VNF from the VNFM to the EM.  NOTE: This reference point is only used if the EM is aware of virtualisation.  Ve-Vnfm-vnf This reference point is used for exchanges between VNF and VNF Manager, and  supports the following:  VNF instantiation / VNF instance query / VNF instance update / VNF instance scaling  out-in, and up-down / VNF instance termination / Forwarding of configuration and  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE FOR 5G NETWORKS  December 2020  39  Element Short description  events from the VNF to the VNFM / Forwarding of configuration and events regarding  VNF, from the VNFM to the VNF / Verification that the VNF is still alive/functional.  NFVI - Virtualised  Infrastructure Manager  (Nf-Vi)  This reference point is used for: Specific assignment of virtualised resources in  response to resource allocation requests / Forwarding of virtualised resources state  information / Hardware resource configuration and state information (e.g. events)  exchange.  NFV Security Manager  (NSM)  NSM is the logical functional block for overall security management, e.g. on the behalf  of network services. In cooperation with MANO blocks dedicated to managing the  virtualised network, the policy driven NSM is specialized to manage the security on a  network service over its entire lifecycle. It covers the following functionalities:  • Security Policy Planning designs and optimizes security policies for specific  targets of protection (e.g. network services);  • Security Policy Enforcement & Validation automates the deployment and  supports lifecycle management of security functions as defined in the design  phase, then configure security policies on the security functions. In addition,  during lifetime of a network service, the validation and re- configuration/remediation of associated security policies is supported, also in  automated manner;  • NFVI Security Manager (ISM) – see below.  NFVI Security Manager  (ISM)  NFVI Security Manager is the logical function dedicated to security management in  NFVI layer. It builds and manages the security in NFVI to support NSM requests for  managing security of network services in higher layer.  Security Element  Manager (SEM)  SEM refers to Element Manager managing Security Functions.  Virtual Security Function  (VSF)  This element is a special type of VNF running on top of NFVI with tailored security  functionality (e.g. firewall, IDS/IPS, virtualised security monitoring functions like vFEP,  vTap). VSFs are mainly required to protect the other VNFs, which constitute a network  service. VSF is managed by either dedicated VNFM or generic VNFM with respect to  its lifecycle.  NFVI-based Security  Function (ISF)  This element is a security function provided by the NFV Infrastructure. It includes  virtualised security appliances or software security features (e.g. hypervisor-based  firewalls) and hardware-based security appliances/modules/features (e.g. Hardware  Security Modules, Crypto Accelerators, or Trusted Platform Modules).  Physical Security  Function (PSF)  This element is a conventionally realized security function in the physical part of the  hybrid network. Even if a telco network is virtualised, additional PSFs are still needed,  for instance to protect the NFV infrastructure (and inherently, the Network Services  running on top) as a whole. PSF is part of the non-virtualised traditional network and  not maintained by the NFVI provider, hence it is managed by the SEM instead of the  VIM.  NFVI - Virtualised  Infrastructure Manager  (NF-Vi)  This reference point is used for: specific assignment of virtualised resources in  response to resource allocation requests / Forwarding of virtualised resources state  information / Hardware resource configuration and state information (e.g. events)  exchange.  3.7.1 ELEMENTS OF NOVELTY (RELEASE 4)  The ETSI Industry Specification Group for Network Functions Virtualisation (NFV) has started working in  2019 on its next specification release, known as Release 4. Release 4 addresses several issues in the  following technical areas: the evolution of the NFV framework to support the most recent cloud, software,  and virtualization techniques; novel management architectural styles and operationalization aspects,  leveraging virtualization characteristics to simplify deployments; and increased support for automation.47  47 https://www.etsi.org/newsroom/press-releases/1652-2019-10-etsi-nfv-release-4-empowers-orchestration-and-cloud- enabled-deployments, accessed October 2020  https://www.etsi.org/newsroom/press-releases/1652-2019-10-etsi-nfv-release-4-empowers-orchestration-and-cloud-enabled-deployments https://www.etsi.org/newsroom/press-releases/1652-2019-10-etsi-nfv-release-4-empowers-orchestration-and-cloud-enabled-deployments  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE FOR 5G NETWORKS  December 2020  40  Key areas of focus for the NFV Release 4 include48:   NFVI evolution, focusing on enhancements to support lightweight virtualization technologies such  as OS containers, optimizing NFV Infrastructure (NFVI) abstraction for reducing the coupling of  VNFs to infrastructure   Enhancing NFV automation and capabilities, covering aspects such as: improving life-cycle  management and orchestration, the simplification of VNF and NS management aspects  leveraging virtualization, and handling advances in autonomous networking   Evolving the NFV-MANO (Management and Orchestration) framework, focusing primarily on  optimizing internal NFV-MANO capability exposure and usage, and on enhanced reliability and  availability   Accompanying operationalization aspects which include: the simplification of NFV to ease  development and deployment of sustainable NFV based solutions, verification and certification  procedures and mechanisms, and operationalization, integration and use of NFV with other  management and network frameworks   In addition to the above technical areas, several security hardening aspects of NFV and other  small specific technical enhancements necessary to maximize the impact of virtualization and  future NFV deployments are also expected to be part of the work programme  The \"Release 4 Definition\" lists all the new features proposed for the Release 4. Among other features that  had not been fully completed in the previous Release and have been carried over into Release 4, the list of  new features includes:   Network connectivity integration and operational for NFV   NFV-MANO automation and autonomous networks   NFV enhancements for 5G   Multi-tenancy enhancements for NFV-MANO   Service-based architecture (SBA) for NFV-MANO   VNF generic management functions, and   Continuous VNF integration  However, the current network architecture of the operators differs in critical points from the envisioned  ETSI NFV architecture. Even if NFV technologies have proven successful technologies in the IT industry,  some adaption is needed to accommodate the special needs of the telecommunications industry.  Currently, traditional network functions are coupled with underlying dedicated hardware, which are vendor  proprietary. Network virtualization migration from traditional network functions to the ETSI NFV architecture  involves restructuring infrastructure, service functions, and operation and maintenance (O&M)49.  Further consideration is needed for allocation of resources for critical infrastructure services. Sharing of  such resources may not be allowed by national regulators for considerations of availability, response time  and confidentiality.  Similarly, NFV functions part of Release 4, such as Multi-tenancy enhancements for NFV-MANO or  Continuous VNF integration, will face adoption hurdles because of national certification and authorisation  schemes.  48 NFV Release 4 Definition v0.2.0 (2020-07)  https://docbox.etsi.org/ISG/NFV/Open/Other/ReleaseDocumentation/NFV(20)000160_NFV_Release_4_Definition_v0_2_0. pdf, accessed October 2020.  49 https://www.gsma.com/futurenetworks/5g/migration-from-physical-to-virtual-network-functions-best-practices-and- lessons-learned/, accessed October 2020.  https://docbox.etsi.org/ISG/NFV/Open/Other/ReleaseDocumentation/NFV(20)000160_NFV_Release_4_Definition_v0_2_0.pdf https://docbox.etsi.org/ISG/NFV/Open/Other/ReleaseDocumentation/NFV(20)000160_NFV_Release_4_Definition_v0_2_0.pdf https://www.gsma.com/futurenetworks/5g/migration-from-physical-to-virtual-network-functions-best-practices-and-lessons-learned/ https://www.gsma.com/futurenetworks/5g/migration-from-physical-to-virtual-network-functions-best-practices-and-lessons-learned/  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE FOR 5G NETWORKS  December 2020  41  3.7.2 SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS  Virtualization  NFV benefits from the inherent security protection brought by the virtualization layer50. The security threats  associated with VNFs are the combination of the security threats on physical networking and on  virtualization technologies. VNFs run over virtual resources such as VMs and cross-contamination for  shared hardware resources is possible, in particular MNO should carefully investigate risks to operate VNF  categorized as critical with others VNF on the same physical resources. Virtualization brings with it some  new attack surface with known vulnerabilities in virtualization environments. If hypervisor is compromised,  other vulnerabilities can arise exponentially. There are potential security issues associated with NFVI,  considering some potential attack scenarios such as VM escape attack, attack on hypervisor management  interface, denial of service (DoS), DNS amplification attack.  A 3GPP Study51 considers the consequences of virtualisation on 3GPP architectures, in order to identify  threats and subsequent security requirements. To adequate security in virtualised deployments, the  underlying infrastructure needs to provide minimum security capabilities in a standardised form which can  be requested and or consumed at the 3GPP layer.  Related component(s): VIM, Virtualisation Layer, NFVI  Management Interfaces / APIs  One of the security challenges is to define the standard interface in the ETSI NFV architecture. New APIs  introduce new threat vectors. Standardisation of interfaces will address security from design phase.  Management Interfaces / APIs must have safeguards in place to avoid being manipulated in unintended  ways to cause disruption. Security challenges are related to Web/API vulnerabilities, Account compromise,  Privileged User Access, Unauthorized access, Unauthorized data/packet, Inspection / Modification of data,  compromise of MANO components. Improper enforcement of security policies, or improper updating policy  rules and data access procedures, allowing attackers to gain access to the NFV MANO module and further  perform unauthorized control for all operations.  Related component(s): Os-Ma-nfvo, Ve-Vnfm-em, Ve-Vnfm-vnf  Localisation of functions  Attacks aiming to place and migrate workload outside the legal boundaries were not possible using  traditional infrastructure. Using NFV, violation of regulatory policies and laws becomes possible by moving  one VNF from a legal location to another illegal location, because there is no mechanism to enforce geo-  restrictions.

The key concept that underpins SDNs is the logical  centralisation of network control functions by decoupling the control and packet-forwarding functionality of  the network. While SDN separates the control and forwarding planes, NFV primarily focuses on optimizing  the network services themselves. NFV complements this vision through the virtualisation of these  functionalities based on recent advances in general server and enterprise IT virtualisation. In this  document, the provisions regarding SDN threats are the ones described in the ENISA Thematic Landscape  SDN/5G52.  As previously mentioned, the fundamental concept of SDN relies on decoupling of the control  and packet forwarding functionality of the network. In classic networks, these two functionalities  were the responsibility of the forwarding devices of the network. In SDN, these two  functionalities have been separated into two functionality planes: the control plane and the data  plane. The separation of these two functionality planes in SDNs has two significant  consequences:  a) it reduces the difficulty in the configuration and alteration of the control functions of the  network, as this functionality has no longer the responsibility of the forwarding devices  of the network that tend to have proprietary implementations (e.g., operating systems),  and  b) it enables the implementation of more consistent control policies through fewer and  uniformly accessible controllers.  The typical SDN architecture, as described by the Open Networking Foundation53, is shown in  the following figure.  Figure 7: SDN architecture Zoom-in  52 ENISA Threat Landscape and Good Practice Guide for Software Defined Networks/5G  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/sdn-threat-landscape/at_download/fullReport, accessed October 2020.  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/sdn-threat-landscape/at_download/fullReport  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE FOR 5G NETWORKS  December 2020  43  The elements of the SDN architecture are as follows:  Element Short description  SDN controller SDN Controller: The SDN Controller is a logically centralized entity in charge of:  • Translating the requirements from the SDN Application layer down to the SDN  Resources and  • Providing the SDN Applications with an abstract view of the network (which may  include statistics and events).  SDN controller is the “brain” of SDN network. An SDN controller manages flow control to  the switches/routers ‘below’ (via southbound APIs) and the applications and business logic  ‘above’ (via northbound APIs) to deploy intelligent networks54.  SDN Application SDN Applications are programs that explicitly, directly, and programmatically communicate  their network requirements and desired network behaviour to the SDN Controller.  Multiple  case scenarios might be envisioned, for the position of the SDN applications in the NFV  architectural framework, such as:  • The network hardware might be a physical appliance talking to an SDN controller, or a  complete solution including multiple SDN components, such as SDN controller + SDN  application for instance;  • The VIM might be an application interfacing with an SDN controller in the NFVI - for  instance OpenStack Neutron as a VIM interfacing with an SDN controller in the NFVI;  • The SDN application might be a VNF talking to an SDN controller, being virtualised or  not. For instance, a PCRF VNF might talk to an SDN controller for some policy  management for traffic steering;  • The SDN application might be an element manager interfacing with an SDN controller  to collect some metrics or configure some parameters;  • The SDN application might be an application interfacing with an SDN controller for  instance in the OSS-BSS for tenant SDN service definitions.  SDN resources Multiple scenarios might be envisaged for the actual location of SDN resources:  • physical switch or router;  • virtual switch or router;  • e-switch, software based SDN enabled switch in a server NIC;  • switch or router as a Virtual network function (VNF).  Northbound Interface  SDN Northbound Interfaces are interfaces between SDN Applications and SDN Controllers  and typically provide abstract network views and enable direct expression of network  behaviour and requirements. This may occur at any level of abstraction (latitude) and across  different sets of functionalities (longitude). One value of SDN lies in the expectation that  these interfaces are implemented in an open, vendor-neutral and interoperable way55.  Southbound Interface  The SDN Southbound Interface is the interface defined between an SDN Controller and an  SDN Data-path, which provides at least:  • programmatic control of all forwarding operations;  • capabilities advertisement;  • statistics reporting, and  • event notification.  One value of SDN lies in the expectation that the Southbound Interface is implemented in an  open, vendor-neutral and interoperable way.  Eastbound-Westbound  Interface  This interface is implemented by the different controllers of the SDN and is used to facilitate  communications between them (Controller – Controller interface).  Control Plane (CP) The plane responsible for the control functionality of the network. Part of the network that is  assigned to control one or more SDN resources.

The functionality  of this plane is realized through a set of physical network devices (network elements).  54 https://www.sdxcentral.com/networking/sdn/definitions/what-is-sdn-controller/, accessed October 2020.  55 SDN Architecture Overview https://www.opennetworking.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/SDN-architecture-overview- 1.0.pdf, accessed October 2020.  https://www.sdxcentral.com/networking/sdn/definitions/what-is-sdn-controller/ https://www.opennetworking.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/SDN-architecture-overview-1.0.pdf https://www.opennetworking.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/SDN-architecture-overview-1.0.pdf  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE FOR 5G NETWORKS  December 2020  44  3.8.1 ELEMENTS OF NOVELTY  Software-defined network (SDN) radically changes the network architecture by decoupling the  network logic from the underlying forwarding devices. This architectural change rejuvenates the  network-layer granting centralized management and programmability of the networks. From a  security perspective, SDN separates security concerns into control and data plane, and this  architectural re-composition brings up exciting opportunities and challenges. The overall  perception is that SDN capabilities will ultimately result in improved security. However, in its raw  form, SDN could potentially make networks more vulnerable to attacks and harder to protect.  Although nothing comes without risks or trade-offs, when it comes to security and SDN clearly  the security benefits of SDN outweigh security risks56.  3.8.2 SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS  Control Plane  SDN provides a logically centralized control plane to the network. The controller of the network  maintains a global view of the network and programs forwarding devices as per the policies  defined at the application layer. While initially controllers were developed as single devices,  recently there has been a shift of trend to distributed controllers with the goal of adjusting to  scalability and reliability requirements of real-world scenarios. In this case, each set of  forwarding devices is assigned to a specific instance of controllers and the controllers, follow a  Master/Slave deployment model.  Control Plane attack refers to the case where an attacker may deduce the forwarding policy of  the network just by analysing the performance metrics of a forwarding device. For example, an  input buffer may be used to identify rules, and by analysing the packet processing times, an  attacker could identify the forwarding policy.  Related component(s): Control Plane, SDN controller  Data Plane  The data plane is composed of networking equipment such as switches and routers specialized  in packet forwarding.  However, unlike traditional networks, these are just simple forwarding elements with no  embedded intelligence to take autonomous decisions. These devices communicate through  standard OpenFlow interfaces with the controller - which ensures configuration and  communication compatibility and interoperability among different devices.  A Protocol Attack refers to attacks targeting the data plane of an SDN by exploiting network  protocol vulnerabilities in the forwarding devices .  A Device Attack refers to all those attacks, where the adversary aims to exploit software or  hardware vulnerabilities of an SDN-capable switch to compromise SDN’s data plane. In this  case, an attacker may target software bugs (e.g., firmware attacks) or hardware features (e.g.,  TCAM memory) of a forwarding device.

While with an Eavesdrop Attack, the attacker aims to learn about  information exchanged between the control and data plane as part of a larger attack plot, in an  Manipulation Attack the attacker’s goal is to corrupt the network behaviour by modifying the  messages being exchanged. The Availability Attack refers to Denial of Service (DoS) attacks,  where the Southbound API is flooded with requests causing the network policy implementation  to fail. Attackers can infer flow rules in SDN from probing packets by evaluating the delay time  from probing packets and classifying them into classes. Knowing the reactive rules, attackers  can launch DoS attacks by sending numerous rule-matched packets which trigger packet-in  packets to overburden the controller.  Similar to SDN’s Southbound API, the Northbound API is susceptible to Interception, Eavesdrop  and Availability.  Attacks. While the nature of both attacks is similar, there are a few key differences:   An attacker targeting the Northbound API requires higher-level of access to the system  and is potentially sitting on the application plane. There may be cases that the  applications do not run on the same device and in that case the attack complexity may  be reduced as to Southbound API.   The impacts of a compromised Northbound API are potentially larger given that  information exchanged between the control and application plane affect network-wide  policies. Unlike Southbound API, where OpenFlow is adopted as the standard, the  Northbound API lacks any standardization. Specifically, each controller has different  specifications for the Northbound API, and this leads to insecure developments57.  Another issue that needs to be looked at is the potential exposure caused by SDN programming  languages (e.g. P4 Programming Protocol-independent Packet Processors), used to  dynamically reconfigure the network. The use of these extremely dynamic and event-based  languages increases the attack surface. Although these languages have not been considered in  the current document, it is proposed to perform a detailed analysis of their misuse potential in  prospective, more detailed threat assessments.

MEC is  located in the logical vicinity of base stations through authorised third parties willing to offer  processing and storage capabilities to subscribers of the 5G network. MEC is a novel approach  57 Software-Defined Network (SDN) Data Plane Security: Issues, Solutions and Future Directions  https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.00262.pdf, accessed October 2020.  https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.00262.pdf  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE FOR 5G NETWORKS  December 2020  46  in the 5G ecosystem that enhances mobile user experience by covering services that, in  previous generations, were using the run-time of end-user devices.  MEC provides a new ecosystem and value chain. Operators can open their Radio Access  Network (RAN) edge to authorized third-parties, allowing them to flexibly and rapidly deploy  innovative applications and services towards mobile subscribers, enterprises and vertical  segments.  Multi-access Edge Computing will enable new vertical business segments and services for  consumers and enterprise customers. Use cases include:   video analytics;   location services;   Internet-of-Things (IoT);   augmented reality;   optimized local content distribution and   data caching.  It is expected that MEC is going to emerge following the evolution of application services and  verticals and will be one of the main drivers for a wider coverage and penetration of 5G  Networks.  Besides offering these services, MEC takes an important role in the 5G infrastructure. It  possesses orchestration functions, interacts with the 5G policy component and supports  lifecycle matters of the offered applications.  By deploying various services and caching content at the network edge, Mobile core networks  are alleviated of further congestion and can efficiently serve local purposes. The structure of  MEC and its elements is shown in the figure below:  Figure 8: MEC architecture Zoom-in  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE FOR 5G NETWORKS  December 2020  47  The elements of MEC are as follows:  Element  Short description  Customer facing service  (CFS) portal  The customer facing service portal allows operators' third-party customers (e.g.  commercial enterprises) to select and order a set of MEC applications that meet  their particular needs, and to receive back service level information from the  provisioned applications.  Device application  Device applications as defined in the present document are applications in the  device (e.g. UE, laptop with internet connectivity) that have the capability to interact  with the MEC system via a user application lifecycle management proxy.  Application Client(s) Application Client is the application resident in the UE performing the client function.  Edge Enabler Client (EEC) Edge Enabler Client (EEC) provides supporting functions needed for Application  Client(s).  Functionalities of Edge Enabler Client are:  • retrieval and provisioning of configuration information to enable the exchange  of Application Data Traffic with the EAS;  • discovery of EAS available in the Edge Data Network.  Edge Configuration Server  (ECS)  Edge Configuration Server (ECS) provides supporting functions needed for the  Edge Enabler Client to connect with an EES. Functionalities of ECS are:  • Provisioning of Edge configuration information to the Edge Enabler Client.  The Edge configuration information includes the following:  o the information for the EEC to connect to the EES (e.g. service area  information applicable to LADN); and  o the information for establishing a connection with EES (such as URI).  User application lifecycle  management (LCM) proxy  The user application lifecycle management proxy allows device applications to  request on-boarding, instantiation, termination of user applications and when  supported, relocation of user applications in and out of the MEC system. It also  allows informing the device applications about the state of the user applications.  The user application lifecycle management proxy authorizes requests from device  applications in the device and interacts with the OSS and the multi-access edge  orchestrator for further processing of these requests.  Multi-access edge  orchestrator  The multi-access edge orchestrator is the core functionality in MEC system level  management, responsible for the following functions: maintaining an overall view of  the MEC system; on-boarding of application packages; selecting appropriate MEC  host(s) for application instantiation; triggering application instantiation and  termination; triggering application relocation as needed when supported.  MEC host  MEC host is an entity that contains a MEC platform and a virtualisation  infrastructure which provides compute, storage, and network resources, for the  purpose of running MEC applications.  Virtualisation infrastructure  It provides compute, storage, and network resources for the MEC applications. The  virtualisation infrastructure includes a data plane that executes the traffic rules  received by the MEC platform, and routes the traffic among applications, services,  DNS server/proxy, 3GPP network, other access networks, local networks and  external networks.  MEC platform  It is the collection of essential functionalities required to run MEC applications on a  particular virtualisation infrastructure and enable them to provide and consume MEC  services. The MEC platform can also provide services.  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE FOR 5G NETWORKS  December 2020  48  Element  Short description  Edge Enabler Server (EES) Edge Enabler Server (EES) provides supporting functions needed for EAS and  EEC. Functionalities of EES are:  • provisioning of configuration information to EEC, enabling exchange of  application data traffic with the EAS;  • supporting the functionalities of API invoker and API exposing function58 as  specified in 3GPP TS 23.222;  • interacting with 3GPP Core Network for accessing the capabilities of network  functions either directly (e.g. via PCF) or indirectly (e.g. via  SCEF/NEF/SCEF+NEF);  • support the functionalities of application context transfer;  • supports external exposure of 3GPP network capabilities to the EAS over  EES interface.  MEC applications  MEC applications are instantiated on the virtualisation infrastructure of the MEC  host, based on configuration or requests validated by the MEC management.  Edge Application Server  (EAS)  Edge Application Server (EAS) is the application server resident in the Edge Data  Network, performing the server functions. The Edge Application Server may  consume the 3GPP Core Network capabilities: invoke 3GPP Core Network function  APIs directly, invoke 3GPP Core Network capabilities through the EES or invoke the  3GPP Core Network capability through the capability exposure functions (i.e. SCEF  or NEF).  MEC service  It is a service provided via the MEC platform either by the MEC platform itself or by  a MEC application.  Service registry  In MEC, the services produced by the MEC applications are registered in the  service registry of the MEC platform – as opposed to the network functions and the  services they produce which are registered in the Network Resource Function  (NRF).  Application Data Traffic Data traffic between the application installed on the User Equipment (UE) and the  application server (EAS / MEC App).  MEC host level management  It handles the management of the MEC specific functionality of a particular MEC  host and the applications running on it. Is comprised of the MEC platform manager  and the virtualisation infrastructure manager.  MEC platform manager The MEC platform manager is responsible for the following functions:  • Managing the life cycle of applications including informing the multi-access  edge orchestrator of relevant application related events;  • Providing element management functions to the MEC platform and  • Managing the application rules and requirements.  The MEC platform manager also receives virtualised resources fault reports and  performance measurements from the virtualisation infrastructure manager for further  processing.  Virtualisation infrastructure  manager  The functionality provided by the virtualisation infrastructure manager in this ‘Zoom- in’ overlaps generally with the functionality provided by the VIM described in the  NFV ‘Zoom-in’.  3.9.1 ELEMENTS OF NOVELTY  ETSI ISG MEC and 3GPP have both worked on their own architectures for edge computing  within the boundaries of their different scopes. Their common purpose is to create an open and  standardized IT service environment for hosting and supporting third-party applications in edge  environments.

At the heart of the ETSI ISG MEC and 3GPP SA6 architectures lie the MEC Platform/Edge  Enabler Server and the MEC Applications/Edge Application Servers respectively. There is a  great degree of synergy in the two architectures on these aspects, and in the information  carried between these functional entities. ETSI GR MEC 031 will provide solution proposals and  recommendations for MEC integration into 3GPP 5G system. On the other hand, 3GPP TS  23.558 Architecture for enabling Edge Applications (Release 17) provides application layer  architecture and related procedures for enabling edge applications over 3GPP networks.  3.9.2 SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS  Virtualization and containerization  Cloud computing will leverage on multiple virtualized systems in order to optimize available  resources and deliver on its proposed benefits. Cloud native MEC provides inherent security  protection due to the isolation and containerization.   Each container performs a dedicated function, enhancing behaviour profiling and  anomaly detection.   Isolation of containers prevents spread of malware and viruses.   Decomposed software provides efficient software version updates and security patches.   Compute services in cloud-native applications are designed to be ephemeral, reducing  the attack surface.   Resiliency is gained with increased speed to start a container and horizontal scale to  dynamically respond to threats.   Segmentation with network slicing separates traffic and isolates compute resources.  However, cloud native MEC architecture is exposed to a number of threats60:   The uses of open source code, more interfaces, and new APIs introduce new threat vectors.   Shared hardware resources can result in cross-contamination.   Vulnerabilities in the shared host platform, Container-as-a-Service (CaaS) and Platform-as-  a-Service (PaaS) can impact the container security.   Containers requiring elevated privileges can cause security risk to both host as well as other  tenant containers.   Dependency upon central orchestration introduces a new threat vector.   High data volume and sessions increase risk from an attack.   Applications running in a micro-service architecture are as vulnerable to the same  attacks as traditional applications.

Related component(s): MEC Host  Application-Programming Interfaces (APIs)  Edge Applications facilitate communication between application clients and applications deployed  at the edge. The architecture enables the CAPIF (Common API Framework) to be leveraged as a  standardized means of providing and accessing APIs in the Edge Cloud. The main purpose of  CAPIF is to have a unified north bound API framework across several 3GPP functions.  Application Programming Interface (API) Security is the design, processes, and systems that  keep a web-based API responding to requests, securely processing data and functioning as  intended. Like any software, APIs can be compromised and data can be stolen. Since APIs serve  as conduits that reveal applications for third-party integration, they are susceptible to attacks.  Related component(s): 3GPP SA6 interfaces, ETSI MEC interfaces  Regulatory issues  In European countries there is specific legislation on the implementation of the NIS directive61  The goal is to protect critical infrastructure that ensure national security. A critical service should  be operated in an area with a security level compatible to this criticality.  If an operator operates in a MEC environment a regulated critical service, it will have to  demonstrate that its environment is compatible with the regulation imposed by the critical  service in the particular country of operation. Physical and logical resources should not be  shared with components which have not the same criticality. This constraint requires the right  level of isolation around the service to prevent regulation pollution to its own components and  infrastructures. A simple solution can be the complete segregation of physical resources  between the operator's MEC functions and the 3rd party ones.

The 5G security architecture consists of components that are part  of various other architectures (“Zoom-ins” in terms of this report), acting thus in a horizontal  manner across all other architectures. In particular, security functions are securing the access of  users within the radio access network (RAN), they cover security functions in the core network  and perimeter entities (edge computing) and they provide security functions in the Network  Function Virtualization. Finally, a set of elements is covering security management functions,  audit and analytics.  The 5G security architecture is defined in 3GPP technical specification62 as spanning  complementary different domains.  61 The Directive on security of network and information systems (NIS Directive) https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single- market/en/network-and-information-security-nis-directive, accessed October 2020.  62 3GPP TS 33.501 V16.4.0 (2020-09) Security architecture and procedures for 5G system (Release 16)  https://www.3gpp.org/ftp/Specs/archive/33_series/33.501/33501-g40.zip, accessed October 2020.  https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/network-and-information-security-nis-directive https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/network-and-information-security-nis-directive https://www.3gpp.org/ftp/Specs/archive/33_series/33.501/33501-g40.zip  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE FOR 5G NETWORKS  December 2020  51   Network access security (I): the set of security features that enable a UE to authenticate  and access services via the network securely, including the 3GPP access and Non-  3GPP access, and in particularly, to protect against attacks on the (radio) interfaces. In  addition, it includes the security context delivery from SN to AN for the access security.   Network domain security (II): the set of security features that enable network nodes to  securely exchange signalling data and user plane data.   User domain security (III): the set of security features that secure the user access to  mobile equipment.   Application domain security (IV): the set of security features that enable applications in  the user domain and in the provider domain to exchange messages securely.  Application domain security is not in the scope of the present analysis.   SBA domain security (V): the set of security features that enables network functions of  the SBA architecture to securely communicate within the serving network domain and  with other network domains. Such features include network function registration,  discovery, and authorisation security aspects, as well as the protection for the service-  based interfaces.   Visibility and configurability of security (VI): the set of features that enable the user to  be informed whether a security feature is in operation or not.  The detailed structure of the 5G security architecture is shown in the following figure.  Figure 9: 5G Security architecture Zoom-in  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE FOR 5G NETWORKS  December 2020  52  The elements of the 5G security architecture are as follows:  Element Short description  Mobile Equipment (ME) ME stands for all kinds of mobile equipment that can be connected to the 5G  network. ME can be sensors, IoT components, connected autonomous systems,  eHealth devices, etc.  Universal Subscriber Identity  Module (USIM)  USIM is the SIM card of 5G.It is a platform for securing access and communication  in 5G. It is the only security module mentioned in 3GPP specification.  5G Node Base Station Central  Unit (gNB-CU)  Some security requirements for gNB-CU have been formulated by 3GPPP. Though  not a security element per se, these requirements increase the security properties  of gNB and – when implemented - are considered to be relevant to the security  architecture.  Non-3GPP Access Network Security for non-3GPP access to the 5G Core network is achieved by a procedure  using IKEv2 as defined in RFC 7296 to set up one or more IPsec ESP security  associations. The role of IKE initiator (or client) is taken by the UE, and the role of  IKE responder (or server) is taken by the N3IW.  Non-3GPP access Inter- Working Function (N3IWF)  This Network Function is responsible for interworking between untrusted non-3GPP  networks and the 5G Core. As such, the N3IWF supports both N2 and N3 based  connectivity to the core, whilst supporting IPsec connectivity towards the device.  Access and Mobility  Management Function (AMF)  The Core Access and Mobility Management Function is part of the 3GPP 5G  Architecture. Its primary tasks include registration Management, Connection  Management, Reachability Management, Mobility Management and various  function relating to security and access management and authorisation.  Security Anchor Function  (SEAF)  The SEAF will create for the primary authentication a unified anchor key KSEAF  (common for all accesses) that can be used by the UE and the serving network to  protect the subsequent communication63.  Authentication server  function (AUSF)  The Authentication server function (AUSF) shall handle authentication requests for  both, 3GPP access and non-3GPP access. The AUSF shall provide SUPI to the  VPLMN (Core Network / Serving Network) only after authentication confirmation if  authentication request with SUCI was sent by VPLMN. The AUSF shall inform the  UDM that a successful or unsuccessful authentication of a subscriber has occurred.  Authentication credential  Repository and Processing  Function (ARPF)  ARPF selects an authentication method based on subscriber identity and  configured policy and computes the authentication data and keying materials  User Data Management (UDM)  Function  Unified data management (UDM) manages network user data in a single,  centralized element. UDM is similar to the 4G network's home subscriber service  (HSS) but is cloud-native and designed for 5G specifically.  The SIDF is responsible for de-concealment of the Subscription Concealed  Identifier (SUCI) and shall fulfil the following requirements:  • The SIDF shall be a service offered by UDM;  • The SIDF shall resolve the SUPI from the SUCI based on the protection  scheme used to generate the SUCI.  Unstructured Data Repository  (UDR)  Repository for management of unstructured data, designed to manage massive and  various types of unstructured data including text, image, audio and video.  Security Edge Protection  Proxy (SEPP)  The 5G System architecture introduces a Security Edge Protection Proxy (SEPP)  as the entity sitting at the perimeter of the mobile network. The SEPP shall act as a  non-transparent proxy node.  63  https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Andreas_Kunz2/publication/319527681_Overview_of_5G_security_in_3GPP/links/59b 116d80f7e9b37434a8248/Overview-of-5G-security-in-3GPP.pdf, accessed October 2020.  https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Andreas_Kunz2/publication/319527681_Overview_of_5G_security_in_3GPP/links/59b116d80f7e9b37434a8248/Overview-of-5G-security-in-3GPP.pdf https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Andreas_Kunz2/publication/319527681_Overview_of_5G_security_in_3GPP/links/59b116d80f7e9b37434a8248/Overview-of-5G-security-in-3GPP.pdf  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE FOR 5G NETWORKS  December 2020  53  Element Short description  Network Slice Specific  Authentication and  Authorisation Function  (NSSAAF)  The Network Slice Specific Authentication and Authorisation Function (NSSAAF)  supports the following functionality:  • Support for Network Slice-Specific Authentication and Authorisation as  specified in TS 23.502 64with a AAA Server (AAA-S).  AAA-S In the optional-to-use Network slice-specific authentication and authorisation, an  AAA server (AAA-S) may be owned by an external 3rd party enterprise.  AAA-P In the above-mentioned scenario, if the AAA-S belongs to a third party, the  NSSAAF may contact the AAA-S via an AAA proxy. The NSSAA Function and the  AAA-P may be co-located.  EAP-ID Network slice-specific authentication and authorisation uses a User ID and  credentials, different from the 3GPP subscription credentials (e.g. SUPI and  credentials used for PLMN access) and takes place after the primary authentication65.  NFV Security Services Agent  (SSA)  The NFV SSA exists in both the NFVI domain and in VNF domain. NFV SSA in  VNF domain may exist as a separate VSF, or within a VNF. The NFV SSA is  responsible for securely receiving the Security Monitoring policy and implementing  the same.  NFV Security Controller (SC) The NFV SC may interface with other security systems (e.g. Security Analytics),  security databases and other policy engines. The NFV SC orchestrates system wide  security policies. The NFV SC acts as a trusted 3rd party that resides independently.  An NFV SC manages NFV SSAs (like VSFs) to keep them in a consistent state  according to the policy specified. SC also facilitates secure bootstrapping of SSAs  (like VSFs), managing instances of SSAs, secure pairing up with SSA's VNFMs and  EMs, personalize the SSAs, policy management, integrity assertion, credential  management, facilitate clustering of multiple SSAs into a distributed appliance,  monitoring of SSAs for failure and remediation.  NFV Security Services  Provider (SSP)  The NFV SSP is comprised within the VIM and VNFM, and is responsible for  security monitoring policy orchestration received from the Security Controller (NFV  SC) and interacting with the various VIM/VNFM components to implement the  policy across various systems comprising the NFVI/VNF. Furthermore, NFV SSP is  also responsible for receiving the telemetry data from various NFV SSAs, and  optionally making some analysis based on this data.  NFV Security Monitoring  Database  The NFV SecM-DB is a secure database consisting of security data used for  deploying NFV system wide Security Monitoring. This includes Security Monitoring  policy and configurations, security credentials for facilitating secure  communications between the various Security Monitoring components, and  credentials for secure storage of telemetry, including tenant-specific security  policies.  SA/VSF Catalogue Database  (VSF-NVNF-CAT)  The NFV VSF-VNF-CAT is a repository for Security Services Agents like the Virtual  Security Functions (VSF) VNFs. The catalogue has capability to add and remove SSAs  (VSF) packages and/or images, and also includes a VSF VNFD (VNF Descriptor)  containing meta data and information about that VSF VNF. Once the SSA (VSF)  package or instance is added to the catalogue, it becomes available for orchestration.  Audit DB The NFV AUD-DB is a secure database consisting of security audit information.  Security Monitoring Analytics  System  The Security Monitoring Analytics system securely receives Security Monitoring  telemetry from across the NFV systems, including the MANO and all the NFVIs that  may be geographically distributed. The analytics system applies advanced machine  learning techniques on the telemetry to perform advanced detection of security  anomalies and emerging threats in the system. This system also can trigger  remediation actions through the NFV SC.  64 3GPP TS 23.502 V16.5.1 (2020-08) Technical Specification 3rd Generation Partnership Project; Technical Specification  Group Services and System Aspects; Procedures for the 5G System (5GS); Stage 2 (Release 16),  https://www.3gpp.org/ftp/Specs/archive/33_series/33.501/33501-g40.zip, accessed October 2020.  65 3GPP TS 33.501 V16.3.0 (2020-07) Technical Specification 3rd Generation Partnership Project; Technical Specification  Group Services and System Aspects; Security architecture and procedures for 5G system (Release 16),  https://www.3gpp.org/ftp/Specs/archive/33_series/33.501/33501-g40.zip, accessed October 2020.  https://www.3gpp.org/ftp/Specs/archive/33_series/33.501/33501-g40.zip https://www.3gpp.org/ftp/Specs/archive/33_series/33.501/33501-g40.zip  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE FOR 5G NETWORKS  December 2020  54  Element Short description  Subscription Concealed  Identifier (SUCI)  A one-time use subscription identifier, which contains the Scheme-Output, and  additional non-concealed information needed for home network routing and  protection scheme usage.

It includes the following keys: KAUSF, KSEAF, KAMF,  KNASint, KNASenc, KN3IWF, KgNB, KRRCint, KRRCenc, KUPint and KUPenc.  3.10.1 ELEMENTS OF NOVELTY  While many new features in Release 16 contribute to increased security, the relevant addition at  the level of Security Functions is the enhanced support for Network Slice-Specific  Authentication and Authorisation.  The feature allows the use of a User Identifier independent of  existing identifiers relating to a 3GPP subscription or UE, for Network Slice-Specific  Authentication and Authorisation. For such Network Slice Specific Identifiers, the AMF invokes  an EAP-based Network Slice-Specific authentication procedure in which the AUSF exchanges  AAA protocol messages with a potentially external AAA Server (AAA-S) via an optional AAA  Proxy (AAA-P) to authenticate and authorize a UE for the network slice. Depending on the  result of the procedure a UE is either authorized for a network slice, re-allocated to a different  one or deregistered.67.  Other relevant security aspects of enhancing the 5G system include:   Security for enhanced Service Based Architecture   Security for User Plane Gateway Function for Inter-PLMN Security   Security aspects of Enhanced Network Slicing   Security for NR Integrated Access and Backhaul   Security aspects of Service Enabler Architecture Layer for Verticals   Security of evolution of Cellular IoT security for the 5G System   3GPP profiles for cryptographic algorithms and security protocols  Last but not least, Release 16 of 5G specifications include updated versions of the 5G Security  Assurance Specifications (SCAS). SCAS provide an extensive description of the security  requirements (including test cases) to demonstrate compliance of the network product with the  security requirements defined by 3GPP. SCAS are continuously developed to embed solutions  to disclosed vulnerabilities and ensure the security of 5G system’s critical components, and of  the 5G system as a whole.  66 https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_ts/133500_133599/133501/15.01.00_60/ts_133501v150100p.pdf, accessed October  2020  67 3GPP TR 21.916 V0.5.0 (2020-07) Technical Report 3rd Generation Partnership Project; Technical Specification Group  Services and System Aspects; Release 16 Description; Summary of Rel-16 Work Items (Release 16),  https://www.3gpp.org/ftp/Specs/archive/33_series/33.501/33501-g40.zip, accessed October 2020.  https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_ts/133500_133599/133501/15.01.00_60/ts_133501v150100p.pdf https://www.3gpp.org/ftp/Specs/archive/33_series/33.501/33501-g40.zip  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE FOR 5G NETWORKS  December 2020  55  The following SCAS requirements have been updated to reflect changes proposed by Release 16:  TS 33.512 - Access and Mobility management Function (AMF)  TS 33.514 - Unified Data Management (UDM)  TS 33.515 - Session Management Function (SMF)  TS 33.516 - Authentication Server Function (AUSF)  TS 33.517 - Security Edge Protection Proxy (SEPP)  TS 33.520 - Non-3GPP Inter-Working Function (N3IWF)  3.10.2 SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS  No security considerations have been developed for this zoom-in. This is due to the fact that all  security consideration covered in the rest of the zoom-ins constitute the entire set of security  considerations, underlying thus its horizontal nature of security. Hence, it is considered that they  cover this topic in an exhaustive manner and there is no need to be repeated in this section.  3.11 5G PHYSICAL INFRASTRUCTURE (ZOOM-IN)  One of the most relevant aspects in the transition from previous generations of mobile  telecommunications into 5G is the fact that part of the network functions, previously performed  by physical appliances, are now executed by software that virtualizes the functionality of  physical components. Additionally, some of these physical components were mostly proprietary  and incompatible with other solutions but with 5G, the network software can run in any  commercial-of-the-shelf (COTS) hardware, allowing the operators to have more independence  from manufacturers and share physical infrastructures among various tenants and applications.  This significant change will allow great scalability, quicker deployments, cost efficiency and  integration between different components of the network. On the other hand, the virtualisation of  physical infrastructure components increases significantly the impact of failures: a shared  physical component will serve multiple functions (e.g. virtual functions, slicing, user equipment  functions, etc.), playing thus a significant role in the service provisioning chain.  Nonetheless, the physical 5G architecture is going to remain exposed to more generic threats  that are pertinent to physical components, such as damage/theft, sabotage, natural disasters,  outages, failures and malfunctions, just to name the most important ones. While in previous  mobile networks such failures had a more “restricted” influence in service provisioning, with the  5G virtualisation failures of physical components may have an amplified impact, typical to  shared resources. This fact increases the criticality of 5G physical infrastructure components,  as multiple services are going to depend on them. The 5G physical infrastructure is depicted in  the following the figure.  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE FOR 5G NETWORKS  December 2020  56  Figure 10: 5G physical infrastructure Zoom-in  3.11.1 ELEMENTS OF NOVELTY  While 5G Release 16 does not bring any novelties to the physical infrastructure per se, a series  of enhancements referred to in other sections of the document will impact the physical  infrastructure and associated security considerations:   Integrated Access and Backhaul, eliminates the need for wired backhaul connection,  allowing a speedier densification of the wireless network.   Improved support for non-public networks (NPN) will lead to an increase in deployment  scenarios that involve private networks that utilize dedicated small cell base stations)  that are independently managed to deliver locally-optimized applications. Further detail  is given in section the 5G RAN zoom-in (see section Error! Reference source not f  ound.).  3.11.2 SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS  Impact of virtualisation  Software Defined Networking (SDN) and Network Function Virtualization (NFV) allow  disconnection of software execution from specific physical hardware and provide for better  resilience and latency. SDN offers flexibility how to configure the routing paths between  dynamically configured virtualized network functions.  It should be noted, that container technology generates a bigger attack surface against systems  (e.g. via supported APIs, and through intrinsically less security functions, by being a technology  at initial maturity levels). However, softwarisation and virtualization of functions may increase  availability and integrity requirements for shared physical resources, some of them placed in  remote locations. Physical security controls for such resources should be commensurate with  their respective importance.  Affected components: Central DC, Local DC  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE FOR 5G NETWORKS  December 2020  57  General Physical security considerations  Physical security considerations valid for previous generations of mobile networks still apply.  They focus around two general objectives: ensuring appropriate environmental conditions for  equipment operations and protection of perimeters hosting sensitive assets.  Special consideration must be given to equipment located in third party premises or otherwise  remote facilities rooms. These should be protected using a risk-calibrated set of physical and  environmental controls aimed to assure access control, monitoring, continuity of operations and  protection against environmental disasters. Failure to do so may lead to unauthorised access,  destruction of assets and impairment of operations.  Related components: Local DC, gNB-DU, gNB-CU  Threats to edge cloud computing resources  The deployment of Edge Cloud computing resources at the edge of the network, in data centres  or data rooms with significantly less physical control and protection than the central data  centres expose important computing resources to physical security threats, which can lead to  service compromise or even an access path to central resources.  Affected components: Edge DC  Vulnerability of air interface to jamming attacks  As any wireless cellular networks, 5G networks are built upon open sharing over specific  frequencies, making them prone to interference. This weakness can be used by some  adversary nodes/equipment to cause intentional interference and hinder legitimate user’s  communication over the spectrum of wireless channels dedicated to this technology. 5G  improves resilience against jamming attacks over the 4G LTE, but remains vulnerable to  customised attacks68. Jamming attacks are a particular concern for mission-critical applications.  Related components: Base stations  3.12 IMPLEMENTATION OPTIONS / MIGRATION PATHS ZOOM IN  5G can be deployed in different deployment options, where SA (standalone) options consist of  only one generation of radio access technology and NSA options consist of two generations of  radio access technologies (4G LTE and 5G). The early deployments will be adopting either non-  standalone option 3 or standalone option 2 as the standardisation of these two options have  already been completed69.  Non-standalone option 3 is where radio access network is composed of eNBs (eNode Bs) as  the master node and gNBs (gNode Bs) as the secondary node. The radio access network is  connected to EPC (Evolved Packet Core). The NSA option 3, as it leverages existing 4G  deployment, can be brought to market quickly with minor modification to the 4G network. This  option also supports legacy 4G devices and the 5G devices only need to support NR (New  Radio) protocols so device can also be developed quickly.  On the other hand, NSA option 3 does not introduce 5GC and therefore may not be optimised  for new 5G use cases beyond mobile broadband. In addition, depending on how 5G devices are  68 Y. Arjoune and S. Faruque, \"Smart Jamming Attacks in 5G New Radio: A Review,\" 2020 10th Annual Computing and  Communication Workshop and Conference (CCWC), Las Vegas, NV, USA, 2020, pp. 1010-1015, doi:  10.1109/CCWC47524.2020.9031175, accessed October 2020.  69 GSMA - 5G Implementation Guidelines: NSA Option 3, February 2020  https://www.gsma.com/futurenetworks/wp- content/uploads/2019/03/5G-Implementation-Guidelines-NSA-Option-3-v2.1.pdf, accessed October 2020.  https://www.gsma.com/futurenetworks/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/5G-Implementation-Guidelines-NSA-Option-3-v2.1.pdf https://www.gsma.com/futurenetworks/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/5G-Implementation-Guidelines-NSA-Option-3-v2.1.pdf  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE FOR 5G NETWORKS  December 2020  58  developed, the EPC may need to be retained longer than in the case of having EPS (Evolved  Packet System) for 4G alone (instead of supporting NSA Option 3).  Standalone option 2 is where radio access network consists of only gNBs (gNode Bs) and  connects to 5GC (5G Core), and the 5GC interworks with EPC. SA option 2 has no impact on  LTE radio and can fully support all 5G use cases by enabling network slicing via cloud native  service-based architecture. On the other hand, this option requires both NR and 5GC, making  time-to-market slower and deployment cost higher than that of NSA option 3. Furthermore, the  devices would need to support NR and core network protocols so it would take more time to  develop devices.  Finally, as the standalone 5G System would need to interwork with EPS to ensure service  continuity depending on coverage, the interworking between EPC and 5GC may be necessary.  Figure 11: Implementation options / Migration Paths  The elements of the Option 3 Non-standalone architecture are:  Element  Short description  EPC Evolved Packet Core (EPC) is a framework for providing converged voice and data on a  4G Long-Term Evolution (LTE) network.  2G and 3G network architectures process and switch voice and data through two separate  sub-domains: circuit-switched (CS) for voice and packet-switched (PS) for data. Evolved  Packet Core unifies voice and data on an Internet Protocol (IP) service architecture and  voice is treated as just another IP application.  EPC+ Evolved Packet Core (EPC) is the LTE Core Network.  In order to support the Non-standalone deployments with LTE and NR technologies, the  core network will need to undergo a series of improvements – hence the EPC+  designation. Envisaged improvements include increasing the bandwidth of the S1-U  interface to meet the LTE/NSA transmission requirements.  There are two typical scenarios for EPC upgrade to support 5G deployment.  Scenario A:  • Physical EPC is upgraded to support NSA;  • Capacity expansion is based on physical EPC.  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE FOR 5G NETWORKS  December 2020  59  Element  Short description  Scenario B:  • Build a new virtualized EPC network to support NSA independently;  • Interoperability is made between the new virtualized EPC and the physical EPC;  • Capacity expansion is based on the virtualized EPC.  At the time of this analysis, priority is given to Scenario B, which can be smoothly evolved  to the target network through the expansion of virtualized EPC.  5G Core Network (5GC) The core network is the central part of the 5G infrastructure and enables all functions  related to multi-access technologies - see 5G Core Network zoom-in.  En-gNB En-gNB is a node providing NR user plane and control plane protocol terminations  towards the UE, and acting as Secondary Node in EN-DC.  En-gNB is a gNB that supports legacy E-UTRAN interface.  MeNB (Master node) The LTE eNB is referred to as the MeNB to indicate that it is the ‘Master’ (M) base station  controlling the ‘Secondary’ (S) 5G NR base station.  In MR-DC (Multi-Radio Dual Connectivity), the radio access node that provides the control  plane connection to the core network. It may be a Master eNB (in EN-DC), a Master ng- eNB (in NGEN-DC) or a Master gNB (in NR-DC and NE-DC).  X2 Interface X2 is an interface for the interconnection of two E-UTRAN NodeB (eNB) components and  an E-UTRAN NodeB (eNB) and an E-UTRAN gNodeB (en-gNB) within the Evolved  Universal Terrestrial Radio Access Network (E-UTRAN) architecture. It is specified in the  3GPP 36.42x series of technical specifications.  The X2 interface provides capability to support radio interface mobility and Dual  Connectivity either between eNBs or between eNBs and en-gNBs of UEs having a  connection with E-UTRAN.  The list of functions on the X2 interface is the following:  • Intra LTE-Access-System Mobility Support for ECM-CONNECTED UE;  • Load Management;  • Inter-cell Interference Coordination;  • General X2 management and error handling functions;  • Application level data exchange between eNBs  • Trace functions;  • Data exchange for self-optimisation;  • E-UTRA-NR Dual Connectivity (EN-DC).  S1 Interface S1 interface for the interconnection of the evolved NodeB (eNB) component of the  Evolved Universal Terrestrial Radio Access Network (E-UTRAN) to the Core Network  (CN) of the Evolved Packet System (EPS). It is specified in the 3GPP 36.41x series of  technical specifications.  The S1 interface supports:  • procedures to establish, maintain and release E-UTRAN Radio Access Bearers;  • procedures to perform intra-LTE handover and inter-RAT handover;  • the separation of each UE on the protocol level for user specific signalling  management;  • the transfer of NAS signalling messages between UE and EPC;  • location services by transferring requests from the EPC to E-UTRAN, and  location information from E-UTRAN to EPC;  • mechanisms for resource reservation for packet data streams.  MME Mobility Management Entity (MME) is the key control-node for the LTE access-network. It  is responsible for idle mode User Equipment (UE) paging and tagging procedure including  retransmissions. It is involved in the bearer activation/deactivation process and is also  responsible for choosing the Serving Gateway for a UE at the initial attach and at time of  intra-LTE handover involving Core Network (CN) node relocation. It is responsible for  authenticating the user (by interacting with the Home Subscriber Server). The Non Access  Stratum (NAS) signalling terminates at the MME and it is also responsible for generation  and allocation of temporary identities to UEs. It checks the authorisation of the UE to  camp on the service provider's Public Land Mobile Network (PLMN) and enforces UE  roaming restrictions.  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE FOR 5G NETWORKS  December 2020  60  Element  Short description  SGW The Serving Gateway (SGW) routes and forwards user data packets, while also acting as  the mobility anchor for the user plane during inter-eNodeB handovers and as the anchor  for mobility between LTE and other 3GPP technologies (terminating S4 interface and  relaying the traffic between 2G/3G systems and Packet Data Network Gateway). For idle  state User Equipment, the Serving Gateway terminates the downlink data path and  triggers paging when downlink data arrives for the User Equipment. It manages and  stores UE contexts, e.g. parameters of the IP bearer service, network internal routing  information.  User Equipment (UE) User equipment is any device used by users to communicate within the 5G infrastructure.  Besides a SIM, user equipment may be home appliances of any kind (e.g. computer, IoT  devices, etc.).  3.12.1 SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS  Risks related to legacy technologies  LTE networks and 5G NSA networks based on LTE core networks will continue to operate in  the operators’ networks for years to come. Early 5G commercial launches are leveraging  3GPP’s Non-Standalone 5G specifications, meaning these early 5G NSA networks are required  to use the LTE control plane protocols and the LTE Evolved Packet Core (EPC) network. Initial  5G NSA launches will deliver only Enhanced Mobile Broadband (eMBB) service so, any LTE  threats and vulnerabilities will also exist in the 5G NSA network.  Even after the operators upgrade their cell sites with 5G radios (gNBs) using the NSA  architecture, some of these 5G NSA cell sites may operate as 5G NSA sites for years after  Standalone 5G networks are operational. NSA architectures are expected to live alongside  each other for a considerable period, so a series of legacy risks will remain active70.  Affected components: EPC, eNB  INTER-RAT (Radio Access Technologies) Handover  3GPP has specified interworking that allows 5GC network functions to support interfaces to an  EPC. Handover attempts to NR connected to 5GC from 4G LTE will occur, with active data  sessions at risk of disruption if a roaming agreement exists for 4G, but not for 5G between  PLMN’s. The MME can prevent such handover attempts by including RAT and Core Network  Type restrictions in the Handover Restriction List to E-UTRAN71.  Roaming  5G NSA roaming is essentially 4G roaming because NSA uses the EPC for all Core Network  functions. From a security perspective, a 5G NSA roaming connection introduces no new  protection, since it continues to use Diameter, SIP/VoLTE and possibly SS7. Diameter and SS7  are vulnerable to eavesdropping including voice calls, reading text messages, and tracking  phones. Note: This consideration is also relevant for 5G SA, as there will be a need for roaming  agreements with non-5G networks, hence Diameter and SS7 attacks will still apply.  70 A 5G AMERICAS White Paper – Security considerations for the 5G Era, June2020 https://www.5gamericas.org/wp- content/uploads/2020/07/Security-Considerations-for-the-5G-Era-FINAL-Word.docx, accessed October 2020  71 GSMA - 5G Roaming Guidelines, May 2020  https://www.gsma.com/newsroom/wp-content/uploads//NG.113-v2.0-1.pdf ,  accessed October 2020.  https://www.5gamericas.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Security-Considerations-for-the-5G-Era-FINAL-Word.docx https://www.5gamericas.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Security-Considerations-for-the-5G-Era-FINAL-Word.docx https://www.gsma.com/newsroom/wp-content/uploads/NG.113-v2.0-1.pdf  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE FOR 5G NETWORKS  December 2020  61  For 5G SA the roaming flows will be considerably different, as HTTP/2 and JavaScript Object  Notation (JSON) will be used versus the legacy Diameter protocol. Voice over New Radio  (VoNR) will replace VoLTE in the 5G network and Security Edge Protection Proxy (SEPP) will  establish a secure, encrypted connection with the roaming partner’s SEPP72.  As regards inter-operators Roaming, the following considerations need to be taken into account:  - Authentication confirmation between 5G SA-Networks must be activated in order to  address the voice&sms eavesdropping, as well as the tracking threats. But whether or  not authentication confirmation will be activated/enforced depends on multiple  parameters.  - According to 33.501, SUPI “should” be encrypted while ME attaches in roaming scenario,  but there are exceptions to this rule, which may become the norm if care is not taken.  Affected components: EPC, eNB.  Note: In roaming, components and procedures not specified by 3GPP play a role, for example  those involved with CDR (Calling Data Record) exchange, such as NRTRDE (Near Real Time  Roaming Data Exchange), SS7 Firewalls and SMS Firewalls.  Failure to meet General Security Assurance Requirements  The security assured by the EPC / 5G Core functions and the security of the Core Network itself  is built upon the permanent update of Security Assurance Requirements for critical network  components.  Failure the ensure that early-deployed systems or sub-systems comply with updated security  assurance requirements may lead to unsubstantiated trust in the security offered by the 5G  system as a whole.  3.13 PROCESS MAP  Telecommunication network security is more than a sum of technical specifications. Security is  built and maintained by security-relevant processes, in four major areas:  - Standardization: operators, vendors and other stake-holders set standards for how  networks around the globe will work together. This also includes how best to protect  networks and users against malicious actors.  - Network design: vendors design, develop and implement the agreed standards for  functional network elements and systems only, and warrant that they have a complete  control and responsibility over the whole delivered systems, which play a crucial part in  making the end network product both functional and secure.  - Network configuration: at the deployment phase, networks are configured for a  targeted security level, which is key to setting security parameters and further  strengthening the security and resilience of the network.  - Network deployment and operation: the operational processes which allow networks to  function and deliver targeted levels of security are highly dependent on the deployment  and operations of the network itself.73  While all stakeholders are relevant to ensure that security is embedded in the 5G System,  design, implementation and operation, two stakeholders are of particular relevance to the  72 A 5G AMERICAS White Paper – Security considerations for the 5G Era, June2020 https://www.5gamericas.org/wp- content/uploads/2020/07/Security-Considerations-for-the-5G-Era-FINAL-Word.docx, accessed October 2020.  73 A guide to 5G network securityericsson.com; Conceptualizing security in mobile communication networks – how does 5G  fit in?: Ericsson AB 2018; https://www.ericsson.com/48fcab/assets/local/news/2018/10201291- 04_gir_report_broschure_dec2018_webb_181212.pdf, accessed October 2020.  https://www.5gamericas.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Security-Considerations-for-the-5G-Era-FINAL-Word.docx https://www.5gamericas.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Security-Considerations-for-the-5G-Era-FINAL-Word.docx https://www.ericsson.com/48fcab/assets/local/news/2018/10201291-04_gir_report_broschure_dec2018_webb_181212.pdf https://www.ericsson.com/48fcab/assets/local/news/2018/10201291-04_gir_report_broschure_dec2018_webb_181212.pdf  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE FOR 5G NETWORKS  December 2020  62  cybersecurity of 5G network. On the one hand, mobile network operators (MNO) have a central,  decision-making role, giving them leverage on the overall secure operation of their networks,  and on the other hand, telecom equipment manufacturers, who are responsible for the provision  of software and hardware required to operate networks and liable for any Trojan or uncontrolled  piece of software delivered to MNO74.  To reflect this, in this section we highlight MNO and Vendor lifecycle processes and the  associated security considerations, along with Security Assurance processes that span across  several relevant stakeholder groups.  3.13.1 MNO Lifecycle Processes  MNO Lifecycle processes are aligned with eTOM – enhanced Telecom Operation Map75, and  include all actions necessary to Design, Build and Operate the 5G Network. eTOM  makes  available  a  standard  structure,  terminology  and  classification  scheme  for  describing  business processes and their constituent building blocks.76  Of increased importance for the Secure Design, Implementation and Operation of the 5G  System are the Resource and Supply Chain Development, Management and Operation  Processes, as well as the Enterprise Risk management Processes.  An overview of the MNO processes most critical to 5G system’s security over the Design, Build,  Operate phases is presented in the figure below:  Figure 12: MNO Lifecycle processes  74 EU coordinated risk assessment of the cybersecurity of 5G networks Report 9 October2019,  https://ec.europa.eu/newsroom/dae/document.cfm?doc_id=62132, accessed October 2020.  75 http://casewise.tmforum.org/evolve/statics/frameworx/#cwtype=index&cwview=index_diagrams_etom_start, accessed  November 2020.  76 M.3050 : Enhanced Telecom Operations Map (eTOM) – An eTOM primer, https://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-M.3050-200702- I!Sup4/en, accessed November 2020  https://ec.europa.eu/newsroom/dae/document.cfm?doc_id=62132 https://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-M.3050-200702-I!Sup4/en https://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-M.3050-200702-I!Sup4/en  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE FOR 5G NETWORKS  December 2020  63  The description of MNO lifecycle processes in correlation with eTOM – enhanced Telecom  Operation Map77 is presented below:  Process Short description of the process  Resource capability delivery This category of processes coordinate and enact deployment of new technologies.  These processes ensure that network and associated resources are deployed in  timely and compliant manner.  This is why well-functioning of these processes is critical to coordinate major system  changes such as transition to 5G  Resource development and  retirement  This category of processes encompasses all processes in the Build phase charged  with development of new technologies and the associated resource types. These  processes are also tasked with the initial decision to acquire external resources,  therefore due needs to be taken to provide necessary controls that take into account  all relevant risks. Last but not least, retirement or removal of certain technologies  and associated resource types, are relevant in the context of transition to new  technologies such as 5G.  Support Resource  management and operation  - Support & Readiness  Support & Readiness processes are to ensure that appropriate resources are  available and ready to support the Operation Phase processes.  Key responsibilities of these processes that directly impact security of the 5G  System include: operations readiness testing and acceptance, Vulnerability  Management, Threat Assessments, Risk Assessment and Mitigation and Secure  Configuration Activities  Resource provisioning Resource Provisioning process deal with allocation, installation, configuration,  activation and testing of resources.  Key responsibilities of these processes that directly impact security of the 5G  System include: verification of resource availability; allocation of resources to  requests from other processes such as incident recovery, vulnerability management  or security function capability; configuration management, and; activation of  resources and updating of resource inventory.  Resource Trouble  Management  Resource Trouble Management processes are tasked with the management of  undesired behaviour of specific resources, hence they are key for timely and  effective management of security events. .  Resource data collection &  distribution  Resource Data Collection & Distribution category of processes encompasses  technical monitoring of resource and service instances and monitoring of enterprise  processes to support to resource and service instances.  Results of monitoring processes provide key input for other processes such as  configuration management, performance management, security management.  Resource Performance  Management  Resource Performance Management processes use information received from  monitoring processes to analyse, control and report on the performance of specific  resources, in order to maintain operational objectives such as service quality and  security. Performance management processes should interface with other process  classes such as Resource Trouble Management, Service Quality Management or  Security Management.  Party Tender Management Party Tender Management processes manage the entire tender lifecycle, from  development of tender documents to tender decision-making.  These processes are key for 5GS compliance and security, as due care should be  taken to include all relevant requirements in tender documents and ensure  adequateness of suppliers to risk classes of purchased products or services..  Party Offering Development  & Retirement  Party Offering Development & Retirement manage the on-boarding and off-boarding  of product specifications and thus are critical to ensure an adequate level of security  at component and system level.  77 http://casewise.tmforum.org/evolve/statics/frameworx/#cwtype=index&cwview=index_frameworx_processes, accessed  November 2020.  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE FOR 5G NETWORKS  December 2020  64  Process Short description of the process  Party Agreement  Management  Party Agreement Management manages all aspects of agreements with suppliers  and partners, from initiation to completion, to enable delivery of business and  technical capabilities required by the 5G system.  Party Support Management processes to engage parties who own and manage infrastructure,  provide infrastructure capabilities, or otherwise provide value to the operator.  Necessary facilities need to be in place to provide for interaction with parties in  delivering products and/or services necessary for the operation of the 5G system.  Party Interaction  Management  Interaction management deals with logging partners/supplier interaction, notification  of interacting parties and matters such as communication channels and  authentication/authorisation. These processes are key to ensure service level and  security at all phases of the 5GS, but also an important element in preventing  unauthorised dissemination of sensitive data.  Party Problem Handling Tasked with timely and effective resolution of all problems related to the  supplier/partner. It includes the entire problem lifecycle, from problem  communication, management, to closure and reporting  Party Performance  Management  Along with resource performance management, this process provides key input to  manage performance of key activities and resources outsourced to external  providers.  Business Continuity  Management  Development of strategies, policies, plans, organizational roles, responsibilities and  procedures for ensuring continuation of business processes and activities in the  event of serious and/or sustained interruption.  The relevant component of BCM for the 5G system are:   Infrastructure recovery planning which provides for recovery and backup  procedures for all key infrastructure capabilities;   Serious incident management planning which defines the operational  procedures and escalation criteria for operational and security incidents.  Note: BCM practices might encompass ITIL Service continuity management.  Fraud Management The general objective of the Fraud Management is prevention, detection and  response to fraud risk, fraudulent activities and actors.  The relevance of Fraud management processes for this document is given by the  fact that they encompass interaction with Law Enforcement Agencies (LEA).  Enterprise risk audit  management  Enterprise Risk Audit Management proactively works with the business to  understand, assess, and report on risk. This category of processes provide  assurance to senior management that the processes and controls to mitigate risk are  effective and conform to reference standards. This process is relevant as the  migration to 5G will expose the MNO to novel risks which must be correctly  identified, evaluated and managed  Insurance management Insurance management processes identify areas and activities within the enterprise  where risk aspects are insurable and analyse the cost/benefits of undertaking  specific insurance. This process is relevant as the migration to 5G will expose the  MNO to novel risks, or may impact the operator’s exposure to currently insured risks.  Regulatory management Regulatory Management processes ensure that the enterprise complies with all  applicable regulations. This might be sector-specific (telecommunications), or  general, e.g. NIS Directive and subsequent national legislation. The relevant  requirements must be fed in to the design and operation processes  Security Management Security management processes as per ISO 27011 / ITU X.1051, including Incident  Management.  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE FOR 5G NETWORKS  December 2020  65  3.13.2 VENDOR DEVELOPMENT AND PRODUCT LIFE CYCLE PROCESSES  Vendor Development and Product Lifecycle processes covers all aspects potentially impacting  a Network Product’s lifetime, including it being planned, designed, implemented, delivered,  updated, and eventually ramped down.  For new Network Products and any modifications of Network Products, the Product  Development phases are executed in a cyclical fashion, starting again from the beginning once  finished for the previous Network Product release78.  These processes must meet a clear set of security objectives and requirements to ensure that  network products meet the baseline security criteria and capabilities necessary as building  blocks for the overall security of the 5G network.  In addition, the network products themselves must meet baseline security criteria, tailored to  their product class. These criteria are defined by 3GPP in the Security Assurance Specifications  (SCASs) series of Technical Specification. Specific use cases and deployment scenarios may  request additional security requirements, as defined by operators or regulators.  An objective assessment process that the network products and the processes at their origin  meet baseline criteria is paramount for building trust in the 5G network, hence an important  input for any procurement decisions.  The GSMA Network Equipment Security Assurance Scheme (NESAS)79 and 3GPP Security  Assurance Methodology (SECAM)80 provide the blueprint for such an evaluation process and  reference criteria. While the allocation of responsibilities among the actors of an assurance  scheme might vary, the activities and their flow should be always based on the principles of  independence, objectivity, competence. The vendor and product lifecycle processes are  presented below:  Figure 13: Vendor and product lifecycle processes  78 FS.16 – NESAS Development and Lifecycle Security Requirements v.1.1, GSMA, 20 July 2020,  https://www.gsma.com/security/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/FS.16-NESAS-Development-and-Lifecycle-Security- Requirements-v1.1.pdf, accessed October 2020.  79 FS.16 – NESAS Development and Lifecycle Security Requirements v.1.1, GSMA, 20 July 2020,  https://www.gsma.com/security/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/FS.16-NESAS-Development-and-Lifecycle-Security- Requirements-v1.1.pdf, accessed October 2020.  80 3GPP TR 33.818 V0.7.0 (2020-05), Technical Report, 3rd Generation Partnership Project; Technical Specification Group  Services and System Aspects; Security Assurance Methodology (SECAM); and Security Assurance Specification (SCAS);  for 3GPP virtualized network products (Release 16), https://www.3gpp.org/ftp/Specs/archive/33_series/33.501/33501- g40.zip, accessed October 2020.  https://www.gsma.com/security/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/FS.16-NESAS-Development-and-Lifecycle-Security-Requirements-v1.1.pdf https://www.gsma.com/security/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/FS.16-NESAS-Development-and-Lifecycle-Security-Requirements-v1.1.pdf https://www.gsma.com/security/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/FS.16-NESAS-Development-and-Lifecycle-Security-Requirements-v1.1.pdf https://www.gsma.com/security/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/FS.16-NESAS-Development-and-Lifecycle-Security-Requirements-v1.1.pdf https://www.3gpp.org/ftp/Specs/archive/33_series/33.501/33501-g40.zip https://www.3gpp.org/ftp/Specs/archive/33_series/33.501/33501-g40.zip  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE FOR 5G NETWORKS  December 2020  66  The description of the Vendor and product lifecycle processes is presented below.  Process Sub-processes  Planning In case of a completely new Network Product, the requirements for the first Release  are planned. In the case of a new version of an existing Network Product, the  requirements for the changes to be introduced by the next release are planned based  on updated functional requirements as well as bug and vulnerability reports received  against prior versions, if applicable.  Design The implementation of the planned requirements for the Release is planned in detail.  Implementation  The planned requirements are implemented as per the design.  Testing and Verification The fulfilment of the requirements by the implementation is verified. If the verification  fails, the relevant requirement usually goes back to the “Implementation” phase. This  phase also contains the security related testing and verification activities.  Release The decision to release a given revision of a tested and verified implementation.  Manufacturing In this phase, the development Release is converted into a deliverable Network  Product. In the case of pure software delivery, this is the delivery of the Release to the  provisioning process.  Delivery The delivery of the manufactured Network Product.  Product development  process  All the phases described above.  First Commercial  Introduction  The Network Product starts its commercial lifetime by means of a first Release to be  accepted for use in live commercial networks. Before that, earlier Releases may have  been tested in test environments.  Update The Network Product is updated by means of either a minor or a major Release. This  phase is usually a cycle of such Releases.  Minor Release  A minor Release fixes vulnerabilities and other bugs found in earlier versions. It  commonly introduces not more than minor feature enhancements and architectural  changes.  Major Release A major Release fixes vulnerabilities and other bugs found in earlier versions. It may  introduce major feature enhancements and architectural changes.  End Of Life No updates for the Network Product are supplied anymore. As this process occurs  after contractual and regulatory requirements to maintain the Network Product have  ceased, this commonly marks the end of a Network Product’s lifetime.  3.13.3 SECURITY ASSURANCE PROCESSES  The operator can use as support for its purchasing decision the results of security conformity  assessments integral to the Security Assurance Methodology, as defined by 3GPP33.916  Technical Specification81.  The SECAM process provides the blueprint for any security assurance scheme such as product  certification and vendor accreditation, and covers the following tasks:  81 3GPP TR 33.916 V16.0.0(2020-07) Technical Report 3rd Generation Partnership Project; Technical Specification Group  Services and System Aspects; Security Assurance Methodology (SCAS) for 3GPP network products (Release 16),  https://www.3gpp.org/ftp/Specs/archive/33_series/33.501/33501-g40.zip, accessed October 2020.  https://www.3gpp.org/ftp/Specs/archive/33_series/33.501/33501-g40.zip  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE FOR 5G NETWORKS  December 2020  67   Vendor network product development and network product lifecycle management  process assurance compliance (assessing if the method used to develop the products  is compliant with the Vendor network product development and network product  lifecycle management process assurance requirements).   Security Compliance Testing (assessing if requested security requirements are  correctly implemented in a network product). This includes Vulnerability Testing  (running of a set of FOSS/COTS tools on external interfaces of the Network product).  The ultimate output of the SECAM evaluation is:   An evaluation report demonstrating compliance of the network product with the 3GPP  security assurance specifications;   Evidence to demonstrate to the test laboratory that the accredited vendor product and  development lifecycle processes have been complied with for the network product;   Evidence that the actors performing the evaluation tasks are accredited by the SECAM  Accreditation Body.  The operator examines the evaluation reports together with the evidence that the actors  performing the evaluation tasks have been accredited by the SECAM Accreditation Body.  Note: while the actors and distribution of tasks and responsibilities among actors may vary in  different Assurance schemes, the general processes and sequence of tasks will stay generally  unchanged, provided that criteria for impartiality and competence of actors that perform  assessment tasks are maintained. The security assurance activities are presented below.  Figure 14: Security assurance activities  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE FOR 5G NETWORKS  December 2020  68  The description of the security assurance activities is presented below.  Activity Description  Accreditation Formal recognition by an accreditation body that a conformity assessment body is  impartial and competent to carry out specific tests or types of assessments.  The Accreditation Body defines requirements and processes for:   vendor network product development and network product lifecycle  management processes accreditation;   test laboratory (vendor owned or third party) accreditation, and   dispute resolution.  Product development  process  Vendor network product development and network product lifecycle management  processes assurance requirements as well as related evaluation activities generic to all  network product classes are defined by the Accreditation Body. In the SECAM scheme,  the requirements are defined in the NESAS Security Assurance Requirements, but  various conformity assessment schemes may define different criteria.  Lifecycle management consists of establishing discipline and control in the updates of  network product during its development and maintenance. Lifecycle management  controls are important during normal improvement of network product as well as for  vulnerability/security flaw remediation (documentation used to track vulnerability/security  flaw, remediation procedure with relation to corrective actions for each identified  vulnerability/security flaw…).  The Vendor network product development and network product lifecycle management  processes assessment covers a vendor's engineering processes and does not  necessarily apply only to a single network product. This means that the results of one  assessment may apply to more than one network product. Vendors can submit their  generic network product development and network product lifecycle management  processes or a subset of them for auditing and accreditation.  Security compliance testing Evaluation process step used to describe activities for checking the compliance of a  network product with applicable Security Assurance Specifications (SCAS).  Vulnerability testing The process of running security tools against a network product.  Vulnerability testing is defined by the use of Free and Open Source Software (FOSS)  and Commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) security testing tools on the external interfaces of  the network product, as well as manual testing procedures for specific attack scenarios.  Operator procurement  decision  The operator examines the network product, the security compliance testing, including  the vulnerability testing analysis reports, the self-declaration as well as the optional  evidence of accreditation from the SECAM Accreditation Body for the actors performing  the evaluation task and decides if the results are sufficient according to its internal  policies. In particular, the operator can perform a sample of the security compliance  testing and vulnerability testing, based on the delivered test procedures.  Audit During an audit, the processes will be evaluated and their application on development  activities in practice will be verified. An accreditation will be awarded, if the requirements  are met.  The accreditation processes consist of:   assessing the skills of the vendor‘s or third-party test laboratories in conducting  an evaluation for conformance to Security Assurance requirements for a given  network product class or range of classes, and   assessing the compliance to Test methodology (for security compliance testing  and vulnerability testing laboratories).  Monitoring The Accreditation Body monitors different kinds of accredited actors within the scheme:   Vendors development and product lifecycle processes, which are expected to  comply with the Security Assurance requirements and   Test laboratories (for security compliance testing and vulnerability testing),  which are expected to comply with the Test Methodology and skills  requirements.  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE FOR 5G NETWORKS  December 2020  69  Activity Description  Standardisation 5G security issues are addressed in the work undertaken by standards bodies, notably  within the workgroup on Service and System Aspects 3 (SA3) of the 3rd Generation  Partnership Project (3GPP). Other relevant standardisation bodies include ETSI and  GSMA.  Development of standards continuously evolve security specifications, taking into  account ongoing research on security threats and vulnerabilities.  Responsible disclosure Vulnerability Disclosure of security vulnerabilities is a well-established process which  allows stakeholders such as security researchers to report details of security  vulnerabilities in products and services.  Vulnerability Disclosure Programmes, such as the GSMA Coordinated Vulnerability  Disclosure (CVD) programme provide a framework that sets clear expectations for  constructive engagement by all parties to remediate or mitigate notified vulnerabilities.82  Results of vulnerability disclosure processes are an important input for standardization  work, as security requirements are evolving to respond to identified vulnerabilities.  82 GSM Association FS.23-GSMA Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure Program, Version 3.016 July 2020,  https://www.gsma.com/security/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/FS.23-v3.0.pdf , accessed September 2020  https://www.gsma.com/security/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/FS.23-v3.0.pdf  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE FOR 5G NETWORKS  December 2020  70  4. 5G VULNERABILITIES  4.1 VULNERABILITY ASSESSMENT METHOD AND SCOPE  This chapter provides the vulnerability assessment for the components of the 5G architecture.  The chapter is structured according to the various zoom-ins: for each zoom-in, a set of  vulnerabilities for all related components is being presented. These vulnerabilities detail the  security considerations formulated for each zoom-in.  Due to the large number of vulnerabilities, and in order to facilitate readability, in this chapter we  introduce vulnerability groups for the components of each zoom-in. The detailed vulnerabilities  of each zoom-in are presented in a corresponding annex. While in the following sections a short  description of vulnerability groups with highlights of the assessed weaknesses are presented,  the annexes provide all details of each individual vulnerability, such as: detailed description,  associated assets, threats exploiting the vulnerability, security controls to remove/reduce the  exploitation surface, stakeholder responsible for the implementation of controls, as well as  references to relevant sources.  For the sake of completeness of vulnerability assessment, some vulnerability groups that apply  to multiple assets throughout several zoom-ins, are repeated in all relevant zoom-ins. This  redundancy has been introduced in order to have a complete picture of the vulnerabilities at  zoom-in level. Examples of such vulnerabilities are: virtualization vulnerabilities, vulnerabilities  emerging from weak hardening of software, logging vulnerabilities, etc.  Each of the following sections is dedicate to a zoom-in. Besides the vulnerability groups  applying to the assets of the zoom-in, it provides a reference to the cyberthreats that may lead  to an exploitation, to the relevant measure foreseen in the Toolbox, as well as to references in  relevant literature.  As regards the target groups of vulnerability assessment, the vulnerability groups presented in  this chapter targets technical experts willing to have an overview of weaknesses of various  technical components included in a zoom-in. This information can be used as a check-list in  order to scrutinize the development of technical and organisation security measures and/or  assess future actions to assess the priorities in the implementation of measures (e.g. depending  on the current status of implementation of 5G functions).  The detailed vulnerabilities found in the annexes target technical experts working in the  implementation of threat mitigation. It may be useful for checking the implementation status,  planning/prioritizing implementation of security protection measures, assessing protection gaps,  scoping of certification activities, etc.  4.2 VULNERABILITY GROUPS FOR CORE NETWORK  In the security considerations of core network, we have identified the following areas of  vulnerabilities:  Service-based architecture: weaknesses are related with the protection of open source APIs, in  particular with their integrity, authentication and protection for the data (in transit and stored).  Security update gap between new security requirements and deployment of updated versions of  network functions in operational systems. Two major factors are relevant for this gap: a)  vendors’ responsiveness in issuing and validating new versions of the network functions that  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE FOR 5G NETWORKS  December 2020  71  address the updated requirements, and b) timeliness and effectiveness of MNO processes to  update (e.g. UDM, AUSF, SEPP, NRF, NEF, SMF, AMF and UPF).  IP Based Protocol stack: the use of widely used IP protocols will lead to a shorted vulnerability  exposure time and high impact of vulnerability disclosure.  Besides these areas of vulnerability, virtualization vulnerabilities are also applicable, as well as  generic vulnerabilities related to soft- and hardware maintenance and hardening.

TM07 PA, FM, OUT,  DIS  A detailed list of core network vulnerabilities can be found in the Annex (see C Annex).  4.3 VULNERABILITY GROUPS FOR NETWORK SLICING  In the security considerations of network slicing, we have identified the following areas of  vulnerabilities:  Security-as-a-Service: While slices provide inherent security through segmentation, slices can  also be used to provide additional security protection and security services specific to the use  case and customer requirements. The implementation of slice security for use cases would rest  ultimately with the Mobile Network Operator (MNO) to include such services in the offer,  depending on its service strategy, market context, and in relation to vertical use-cases. This  might the source of vulnerabilities, to be checked for each particular implementation.  Resource isolation: While network slicing offers the ability of isolation to be used in various  scenarios, the proper isolation technique has to be suited to the use case at hand. Security  requirements of the particular use case will be an important element of consideration for the  selection of proper isolation mechanisms.  Secure Management and Orchestration: The architecture of the network slice MANO is  challenging from a business model perspective. This high complexity and flexibility, which bring  in higher security risks. Due to not finalized 3GPP specifications of authorisation of service  management requests, implementation weaknesses may arise.  Trust Model: The building of trust to MNO capabilities for the various 5G operation models has  to be based of the specified APIs. It needs to be assessed, if these APIs are sufficient for all  three defined operation models and how implementation will use them, in order to avoid  vulnerabilities in the management functions.  Besides these areas of vulnerability, virtualization vulnerabilities are also applicable, as well as  generic vulnerabilities related to soft- and hardware maintenance and hardening. The following  table provides a more exhaustive view on vulnerabilities of network slicing components.  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE FOR 5G NETWORKS  December 2020  75  Name Description  Relevant toolbox  measures  Threat  categories  Vulnerabilities in  implementation of  NS security  functionalities  Vulnerabilities in network segment negotiation  procedures need to be secured in a standardized  way to prevent malicious attacks, e.g. man-in-the- middle (MitM) attacks that could modify and  downgrade slice capabilities.  TM01, TM02,  TM05  NAA-EXPL,  NAA-AAA  Service Based  Vulnerabilities in  Network Slicing  Management  Network Slicing Management interface should be  secured so that only authorized parties can create,  alter, and delete network slice instances. If a  malicious party gained access to an insecure  management interface, or if it could replay or modify  a valid message, then it would be able to spoof a  genuine network manager to compromise slice  security.

ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE FOR 5G NETWORKS  December 2020  76  4.4 VULNERABILITY GROUPS FOR RADIO ACCESS NETWORK  In the security considerations of radio access network, we have identified the following areas of  vulnerabilities:  Security of Ultra-Reliable Low-Latency Communication (URLLC): weaknesses in the  implementation of QoS may impact low-latency requirements. Optimization issues of control  and user plane will affect reliability and low latency of communications.  Vulnerability to Radio Jamming Attacks: an inherent weakness of wireless cellular  communications is the free frequency space that allows for intentional or unintentional  interferences. They can impact access of legitimate users and cause resilience issues in parts  of the network.  Failure to meet General Security Assurance Requirements: a set of weaknesses will arise  through the update requirements of various elements of RAN due to implementation of  migration steps and the ability of early-deployed systems to comply with specification updates  regarding security functions.  Optional nature of security controls for F1 interface: the optionality of security controls for this  protocol may lead to security weaknesses in its implementation.  Besides these areas of vulnerability, virtualization vulnerabilities are also applicable, as well as  generic vulnerabilities related to soft- and hardware maintenance and hardening.

Localisation of functions: while physical functions of previous mobile networks have not allowed  for mobility of functions, the introduced virtualization may lead to moving virtualized functions  outside their original location, notably outside the perimeter of protecting measures/policies.  Besides these areas of vulnerability, virtualization vulnerabilities are also applicable, as well as  generic vulnerabilities related to soft- and hardware maintenance and hardening.

Such attacks are based on input buffer analysis to identify  forwarding policy and eventually perform manipulations based on the analysis results.  Data Plane: As SDN data planes are just simple forwarding elements with no embedded  intelligence, they may become targets of protocol attacks, exploiting protocol vulnerabilities in  the forwarding devices.  Programmable Interfaces (APIs): The Southbound API may be misused for a series of attacks.  These attacks are based on inferred flow rules in SDN through packet probing. Knowing the  reactive rules, attackers can launch DoS attacks by sending numerous rule-matched packets  which trigger packet-in packets to overburden the controller.  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE FOR 5G NETWORKS  December 2020  81  Besides these areas of vulnerability, virtualization vulnerabilities are also applicable, as well as  generic vulnerabilities related to soft- and hardware maintenance and hardening. The table  below provides a more exhaustive view on vulnerabilities of software defined networks  components.

ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE FOR 5G NETWORKS  December 2020  82  4.7 VULNERABILITY GROUPS FOR MULTI-ACCESS EDGE COMPUTING  In the security considerations of multi-access edge computing, we have identified the following  areas of vulnerabilities:  Virtualization and containerization: Being based on virtualization and containerization, MEC  may be vulnerable to a number of threats emerging from these technologies. Examples are:  possible contamination of shared hardware resources, abuse of privilege elevation  vulnerabilities of containers with higher levels of privileges, dependencies to central  orchestration functions, high data and session volumes that can be subject of attacks, use of  open-source APIs.  Physical security: flaws in physical security of MEC hardware may render such infrastructures  vulnerable to physical attack. Given the fact of higher geographical distribution of such  infrastructures, keeping a uniform level of physical security will be a challenge.  Application-Programming Interfaces (APIs): Though a dedicated architecture (CAPIF) is  proposed to cope with access to APIs, it has to be ensured that these provisions are followed  during API design and implementation phases. As being exposed to user access, usually such  APIs are subject to multiple attacks.  Regulatory issues: European regulation (NIS-Directive), foresees an isolation of physical and  logical components of critical services from services with low criticality. The implementation of  requirement in MEC may lead to vulnerabilities of low criticality services, as they are going to be  operated in a security domain with less security functions.  The table below provides a more exhaustive view on vulnerabilities of MEC components.

TM01, TM05  NAA-{all}, FM,  UD  A detailed list of multi-access edge computing vulnerabilities can be found in the Annex (see H  Annex).  4.8 VULNERABILITY GROUPS FOR SECURITY ARCHITECTURE  Given the fact that vulnerabilities in all zoom-ins cover security issues of the 5G architecture in  a horizontal manner, no additional security vulnerabilities have been developed for the  components of the security zoom-in. Hence, it can be considered that the entire set of  vulnerabilities assessed for all other zoom-ins cover the full set of security vulnerabilities.  4.9 VULNERABILITY GROUPS FOR PHYSICAL INFRASTRUCTURE  In the security considerations of physical infrastructure, we have identified some areas of  vulnerabilities. Given the fact that the physical infrastructure is the common basis for the  implementation of all other zoom-ins, the assessed physical vulnerabilities are derived by the  vulnerabilities of all zoom-ins by means of their relevance to the physical components. Hence,  the vulnerabilities below draw consequences of the vulnerabilities mentioned in other zoom-ins,  by concentrating on their physical aspects:  Impact of virtualisation: The physical measures/controls will need to be derived by and be  complementary to weaknesses encountered by the implementation of functions in containerized  and virtualized environments (see also vulnerabilities of MEC in section 4.7 above). This will  mainly impact physical availability measures for the concerned functions.  General physical security considerations: General physical measures need to be developed  based on vulnerabilities and resulting risk-exposure that are related to the operational needs,  supply chain of various components (delivery, operation, implementation, maintenance) and  criticality of services. Given the large number of roles involved in 5G infrastructures, the  identification of physical vulnerabilities requires a holistic approach.  Threats to edge cloud computing resources: attack surface reduction of MEC services will rely  on physical measures taken for the relevant components (see also vulnerabilities in section 4.7  above).  Vulnerability of wireless frequencies to jamming attacks: as a high number of wireless  connections are involved in the communication within the 5G infrastructure, both in the public  and non-public domain, physical measures for the reduction of impact of jamming attacks need  to be taken into account, especially on availability of communication channels.  The following table provides a more exhaustive view on vulnerabilities of physical infrastructure.

Jamming attacks are a special concern for mission- critical applications, in particular for their availability.  NAA-DoS  Vulnerabilities  related to  virtualisation  technologies  Softwarisation and virtualization of functions only  increase availability and integrity requirements for  shared physical resources, some of them placed in  remote locations.

ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE FOR 5G NETWORKS  December 2020  86  4.10 VULNERABILITY GROUPS FOR IMPLEMENTATION OPTIONS  In the security considerations of 5G implementation options – migration paths, we have  identified the following areas of vulnerabilities:  Risks related to legacy technologies: these risks materialize through exploitation of  vulnerabilities that are concerned with mismatches of functionalities of non-standalone 5G  networks (NSA) to the current specifications. An example hereto are the use of the LTE Evolved  Packet Core (EPC) and the LTE control panel. In this way, for NSA 5G networks, threats and  vulnerabilities of the LTE technology will persist.  Roaming: during migration, 4G roaming is being used for 5G. This roaming does not include the  new 5G security functions, while maintaining Diameter, SIP/VoLTE and possibly SS7. These  protocols are vulnerable to eavesdropping and tracking.  Security update gap between new security requirements and deployment of updated versions of  network functions in operational systems. Two major factors are relevant for this gap: a)  vendors’ responsiveness in issuing and validating new versions of the network functions that  address the updated requirements, and b) timeliness and effectiveness of MNO processes to  update. This may lead to vulnerabilities in operational NSA 5G infrastructures.  Besides these areas of vulnerability, virtualization vulnerabilities are also applicable to  implementation options. The table below provides a more exhaustive view on vulnerabilities of  components used within 5G implementation options.  Name Description  Relevant toolbox  measures  Threat  categories  Vulnerabilities of  legacy technologies  Vulnerabilities inherited from the LTE system include:  • Lack of integrity protection of over-the-air User  Plane traffic;  • Exposure of international mobile subscriber  identities (IMSI) over the air;  • Weaker cryptographic algorithms.  TM05 NAA-AIL, NAA- SGN, EIH  Improper  implementation of  updated security  functions  The updated requirements for LTE critical components  involved in Non-standalone implementations include  security controls for known vulnerabilities and allow  interoperability by the 5G Components.

TM04 NAA-AVM, FM  LTE Roaming  vulnerabilities  5G NSA roaming is essentially 4G roaming. From a  security perspective, a 5G NSA roaming connection  introduces no new protections since it continues to use  Diameter, SIP/VoLTE and possibly SS7.

As mentioned in section 3.13, the processes considered are MNO life-cycle  processes, vendor development and product life-cycle, as well as security assurance.  Though we have not developed any security considerations in section 3.13 – as we did for the  3GPP specified components - in the discussion below we enlist weaknesses that may arise  from the absence of maintenance processes for life-cycle considerations regarding the entire  5G infrastructure.  4.11.1 MNO processes  Security of the 5G System is achieved and maintained by upholding security objectives across  the entire lifecycle of the system, in particular from the side of Mobile Network Operator (MNO).

ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE FOR 5G NETWORKS  December 2020  93  5. ASSETS  5.1 ASSET CLASSIFICATION AND MAPPING  One critical and initial step in any threat assessment is to identify and classify the most sensitive  assets that, if compromised, may pose a certain level of risk to an individual or organisation.  These activities are part of the asset security domain that focus on collecting and handling the  information required to define the model and a strategy to protect the attribute and value it  represents. In the 5G context, the monetisation of asset attributes such as network slicing,  cloud and Edge computing are in the centre of the value concept of this new generation of  mobile communications.  The 5G architecture considers four main areas that includes user equipment, radio access  network, core network and data network. In this report, we cover two main areas which are the  most significant on 5G evolution: the core network and radio access. We leave user equipment  and data network for future analysis. In the context of this report, we consider various asset  categories that relate to critical components or entities in a 5G network. These components and  entities are of a heterogeneous nature and require differentiated asset security strategies from  owners and/or stakeholders. For example, the interoperability, multi-level and seamless usage  may result in unauthorised and opportunistic access to the network.  We also identify differentiated roles assumed by various actors (presented in chapter2.1  above2.1 of this report), in the definition and implementation of these asset security strategies.  These however, may change in importance, sensitivity and relevance over time, depending on  the product or service lifecycle stage. Each mapped asset may expose certain vulnerabilities or  weaknesses during the lifecycle that if exploited may pose a threat to the confidentiality,  integrity and availability (CIA triad) of systems and data transmitted of parts or the entire 5G  network.  The scope of this document is not to report on a specific asset inventory but to direct the reader  on where to look when conducting such exercises. The responsibility of mapping the sensitive  assets of network relays with the operator since it depends on the technology used, network  product implemented, processes adopted, type of organisations and the services offered. A  mapping of assets and the CIA Triad is presented Table 3.  In the first version of the ENISA Threat Landscape Report for 5G Networks (ETL5G), we  prepared a categorisation of assets based on a high-level architecture presented in the  document. We also review the importance and relevance of these assets to the CIA triad  properties. The categorisations considered a specific definition of assets based on a GNP  (Generic Network Product) class description. A GNP is a class of network products that  implement a common set of 3GPP-defined functionalities for a particular component. According  to 3GPP, the critical assets of GNP to be protected are:   User account data and credentials (e.g. passwords);   Log data;   Configuration data, e.g. GNP's IP address, ports, VPN ID, Management Objects (e.g.  user group, command group) etc.   Operating System (OS), i.e. the files that make up the OS and its processes (code and  data);  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE FOR 5G NETWORKS  December 2020  94   GNP Application;   Sufficient processing capacity: that processing powers are not consumed close to  limits;   Hardware, e.g. mainframe, board, power supply unit etc.   The interfaces of GNP to be protected and which are within SECAM scope: for  example  o Console interface, for local access: local interface on MME  o OAM interface, for remote access: interface between MME and OAM system  o GNP Software: binary code or executable code  All the above critical assets from release 15 of the 3GPP Security Assurance Specification  (SCAS) fit in the asset categories defined in the first edition of the ETL5G.  In this edition, we update the asset categorisations based on new requirements introduced by  release 16 of the 3GPP technical specifications and the new 5G use cases. We classified the  sensitive assets considering the stages of the implementation lifecycle using the eTOM –  enhanced Telecom Operation Map86 as a guide. We assume that certain assets gain a  particular importance or sensitiveness during different stages of the GNP lifecycle. We also  update the information about stakeholders from the previous edition and correlate it with the  new asset categorisation.  5.2 NEW ASSET CATEGORIES  The following 5G asset categories derive from the high-level architecture presented in chapter  3.2 of this report and classification based on release 16 of the 3GPP technical specifications.  The high number of sensitive assets identified from the architecture resulted in a complex and  large diagram, making it difficult to read and display in this report. We use part of the diagram to  depict each asset group. The diagram is structured using asset groups according to their  exposure to threats. By taking into account the role of assets in maintaining the security-related  properties of confidentiality, availability and integrity (known as CIA triad), an initial assessment  of their importance has been developed. In doing so, the emphasis has been given to asset  groups responsible for maintaining the overall security and availability of the 5G infrastructure  and that are known targets of cyber-attacks.  This new categorisation introduces new groups at the lower or more detailed level of the asset  classification, deriving from the requirements of release 16. Another important aspect is the  definition of a high-level classification introducing main categories. These main categories,  depicted in Figure 15, include components and entities from management & orchestration,  network products, protocols, data, interconnections, services, processes and organisation. The  main advantage of having this new upper level is to allow the possibility to define different asset  security strategies depending on the characteristics of each asset group. The assets in these  groups share important characteristics such as type of vulnerabilities, stakeholders and  controls. These characteristics change quite substantially and require differentiated approaches  in the asset security strategy. A complete diagram of the asset map is present in Figure  in  Annex A.  86 http://casewise.tmforum.org/evolve/statics/frameworx/#cwtype=index&cwview=home, accessed November 2020.  http://casewise.tmforum.org/evolve/statics/frameworx/#cwtype=index&cwview=home  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE FOR 5G NETWORKS  December 2020  95  Figure 15: Main categories of 5G network assets  Network Products: This main category includes network planes, functions and elements.  These derive into multiple asset groups that could be found in the previous asset mapping like  core functions, physical infrastructure, security, software-defined networking (SDN), among  others. The main category is a core part of the 5G architecture and one of the most critical in  any 5G asset mapping.  Figure 16: 5G Asset groups from the Network Products category  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE FOR 5G NETWORKS  December 2020  96  Figure 16 depicts the second, third and fourth level groups of the Network Products asset  category. However, not all levels are displayed; hence, we present the full diagram at ENISA  website87 using an interactive tool to explore the inwards of the different asset categories.  Management and orchestration: This main category includes the management of network  functions, network slicing, operations support system, network/element (EMS/NMS) and SDN  Controller. Figure 17 depicts the different asset groups of MANO.  MANO is the most vital part of the 5G infrastructure since is responsible for controlling the entire  set of network functions, their virtualisation and entire software lifecycle related hereto. The  main parts of MANO are the Network Function Virtualisation (NFV) orchestrator, the Virtual  Network Function (VNF) manager, and the virtualised infrastructure manager. Given its  important role, MANO is going to be exposed to numerous attacks with potential major impact  on the entire managed 5G infrastructure environment. The assets of MANO are also depicted in  detail in the corresponding ‘Zoom-in’ in the 5G architecture chapter 3.5.  Figure 17: Asset groups from the Management & Orchestration category  Protocols: This main category of 5G assets include IP and cellular stack. ENISA reviewed the  legacy protocols SS7 and Diameter in a study conducted in 201888. Early generations of mobile  networks such as 2G and 3G rely on these protocols that still contain many critical  vulnerabilities yet to be resolved. 5G networks will need to support SS7 and Diameter for the  foreseeable future (decades) in order to maintain global connectivity (roaming). Figure 18  depicts the various groups of assets associated with protocols typically implemented in a 5G  Network.  Figure 18: Asset groups from the Protocols category  Interconnections: This main category of 5G assets include home/visitor PLMN, security Edge  Protection Proxy (SEPP), packet data network gateway (PGW), N3IWF - Non-3GPP  87 https://www.enersec.net/Asset_MM/ accessed October 2020.  88 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/signalling-security-in-telecom-ss7-diameter-5g, accessed October 2020.  https://www.enersec.net/Asset_MM/ https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/signalling-security-in-telecom-ss7-diameter-5g  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE FOR 5G NETWORKS  December 2020  97  Interworking, trusted non-3GPP Gateway Function (TNGF), wireline Access Gateway Function  (W-AGF) and trusted WLAN Interworking Function (TWIF) asset groups. Figure 19 depicts the  various assets groups associated with interconnections that could be implemented in a 5G  Network.  Figure 19: Asset groups from the Interconnections category  Data: This main category of 5G assets include user, application, system, network, SDN and  security data. This asset group includes the entire data catalogue required in any 5G operation  combined with used data. Though not necessarily exhaustive at this stage of the analysis, this  asset group covers information related to: user data, system and configuration data, security-  related data, network data (configuration, edge, logs, API-data, SDN-data, etc.). It is expected  that 5G data such as user, security and configuration information will be subject to cyber-  attacks with the aim to breach them. Main motives are monetisation and unnoticed access to  the network.  Figure 20: Asset groups from the data category  Services: This main of 5G assets include the use cases, multi-edge computing (MEC) and cloud  service asset groups. These services are directly related with the asset monetisation model of a  5G Network and consequently represents part of the value generated that needs to be protected.  In this version of the 5GTL we review assets that support the value generation model but not the  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE FOR 5G NETWORKS  December 2020  98  model itself. These were already covered by ENISA in previous work (cloud computing,  autonomous vehicles, IIOT89) or are part of recommendations for future research work.  Figure 21: Asset groups from the Services category  Processes: This main category of 5G assets include the MNO and the product development  lifecycle processes. All these processes are vital in a secure and reliable implementation of a  5G Network.  Figure 22: Asset groups from the Processes category  89 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications accessed October 2020.  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE FOR 5G NETWORKS  December 2020  99  Organisation: This main category of 5G assets include time, legal, policy, business support  systems (BSS) and human assets.  Many components in this asset category were also included in the previous mapping. For  example, human assets are considered an important group since humans represent all  individuals involved in the operation and use of the 5G network. Time for example plays a  significant role in many time-dependent functions. With release 16 and the introduction of  mission-critical uses cases requiring constant time synchronisation (e.g. ITS, V2X, IIoT and  URLLC), this asset plays an even more important role in a 5G Network.  Figure 23: Asset groups from the Organisation category  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE FOR 5G NETWORKS  December 2020  100  5.3 ASSET CLASSIFICATION AND THE CIA TRIAD  In the following table, we provide the relevance of the identified asset groups with regard to the CIA  triad.  Table 3: Relevance of asset groups to the maintenance of CIA properties  Asset C CIA Triad  Confidentiality Integrity Availability  Management &  orchestration  ● ● ●  Network products ● ● ●  Protocols ● ●  Data ● ● ●  Interconnections ● ● ●  Services ● ● ●  Processes ● ● ●  Organisation ● ● ●  Legend:  Very high relevance of asset group to maintain the property:  ●  High relevance of asset group to maintain the property:  ●  Medium relevance of asset group to maintain the property:  ●  Low relevance of asset group to maintain the property:  ●  Very low relevance of asset group to maintain the property:  ●  The assignment of these security properties has been performed at the level of asset groups. We  recommend performance of this exercise in higher detail, depending on the focus of prospective  threat assessments. In this case, to achieve a more precise mapping, users of this document  should obtain a more accurate internal evaluation of these properties.  Concluding this chapter, it is worth mentioning that due to its complexity and the early stage of 5G  networks (development, deployment, specification) the asset mapping is an ongoing task that will  need some time to reach a mature stage. This is due to a variety of reasons/issues regarding the  parameters of current 5G activities (narrow time windows for the creation of reports, resource  issues, knowledge transfer, vendor’s enrolment, etc.). These challenges will be sufficiently  managed in future assessment of 5G threats.  5.4 THE RELEVANCE OF ASSETS THROUGHOUT THE LIFECYCLE  The following table presents the relevance of the identified asset groups with regard to the 5G  network lifecycle.

To complement the analysis, we added the potential impact  and information about the affected assets. We used ENISA threat taxonomy to group these  threats in one common list. In this edition, we continued reviewing the threat landscape by  updating the information from the previous edition and added new elements to the analysis. In  summary, we:  1. reviewed the network architecture based on the specifications defined in release 16 for  a generic network product (GNP);  2. reviewed the asset map based on the revised architecture and product lifecycle;  3. added information about vulnerabilities;  4. made a correlation between sensitive assets and vulnerabilities to look for exploitation  opportunities;  5. used STRIDE90 model to structure the information about threats and;  6. prepared a list combining all the information available about threats, including the ones  from the previous edition and other sources such as 3GPP and GSMA.  As previously mentioned, we used the STRIDE model to structure information about threats.  According to ISO 2700191, a threat can be defined as “the potential cause of an incident that  may result in a breach of information security or compromise business operations.”. In the  context of this report, we collected information about various potential causes of an incident  during the design, build, operation support & readiness and operations (fulfilment and  assurance) of a 5G Network structured in 6 main categories (spoofing identity, tampering,  repudiation, information disclosure, denial of service and elevation of privilege).  6.1 TAXONOMY OF THREATS  With the proliferation of methods, taxonomies and models, it is imperative to establish a  common understanding of the different terms used to describe the threat landscape. It should  start with the categorization of important elements such as assets, vulnerabilities and threats.  For example, the adoption of a common taxonomy in 5G security will help improving  communication among the various stakeholders in policymaking, regulation, product  development, system implementation and operation. For that purpose, ENISA presents a threat  taxonomy in Table 5 Annex B.  6.2 THREAT MAP  At this stage, we have completed the security risk management triangle with information about  assets, vulnerabilities and threats. Conducting a more detailed assessment for a particular  context and use case, it will be possible to complete the entire model. In this revision of the  threat map, we structured the information from the previous edition of this report and generic  threats from 3GPP security assurance specification (SCAS) using the STRIDE model.  90 https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/commerce-server/ee823878(v=cs.20)?redirectedfrom=MSDN,  accessed October 2020.  91 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/threat-risk-management/risk-management/current-risk/laws-regulation/rm-ra- standards/iso-iec-standard-27001, accessed October 2020/  https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/commerce-server/ee823878(v=cs.20)?redirectedfrom=MSDN https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/threat-risk-management/risk-management/current-risk/laws-regulation/rm-ra-standards/iso-iec-standard-27001 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/threat-risk-management/risk-management/current-risk/laws-regulation/rm-ra-standards/iso-iec-standard-27001  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE FOR 5G NETWORKS  December 2020  103  Threat Type Threats Potential Impact Affected Assets  Nefarious Activity/  Abuse of assets (NAA)  Manipulation of network configuration/data forging  -

THREAT AGENTS  The assessed threat agents engaged in attacks of 5G infrastructures remain identical to the  previous edition of the 5G Threat Landscape8. This is due to the fact that there are no insights  about malicious activities targeting 5G infrastructures. Main reasons for this are:   Due to the early stages of 5G deployments, no incidents of attacks to 5G  infrastructures have been identified during 2020;   The threat agent assessment is based on hypothetical attacks;   The current threat landscape is done at the level of specifications. Real attacks will  happen against implementations. This will influence modus operandi;   As business processes that will run of 5G infrastructures are still unknown, it is difficult  to assess threat actor motives other than the obvious state-sponsored interventions.  There are no indications about the most frequent threat of cybercrime.  These points make clear that as the next generation of Mobile Networks (5G) are being  deployed, existing threat agent profiles will develop towards a new set of capabilities and  motives. Nonetheless, without any analysis of specific implementations of 5G infrastructures  and business processes running on these infrastructures, a threat agent assessment can be  performed only at a generic hypothetical level.  Given this the complexity of 5G infrastructures and the ambiguity regarding 5G related attack  vectors, it is expected that the following facts will influence the attacker profile:   A whole set of new vulnerabilities related to individual 5G deployments will expand the  attack surface, exposure, number and nature of critical assets.   New tools/methods to exploit those vulnerabilities will be developed.   New motives/ impacted targets are going to be observed due to the interconnected  verticals/applications.   Existing threat agent groups may be expanded with ones that have an interest in novel  malicious objectives emerging from the upcoming 5G use-cases.  These facts may cause an unprecedented shift of capabilities and objectives of existing threat  agent groups in ways that have not been seen in the past.  Having regard to the above mentioned facts, in the current 5G Threat Landscape, we stick to  the threat agent groups assessed in the previous edition taking into account the following threat  agent groups:   Cyber criminals   Insider (own, third parties)   Nation states   Hacktivists   Cyber-fighters   Cyber-terrorists   Corporations   Script kiddies  Interested readers should revisit the previous 5G Threat Landscape edition8 to find the  descriptions and motives of these threat agent groups.  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE FOR 5G NETWORKS  December 2020  119  For the sake of completeness, we provide below a mapping between threat agents and cyber-  threats used in this report.

Given  the detailed vulnerability analysis presented in this document (see Annexes C-M), it is possible to infer the potential  engagement of these threat agent groups in exploitation campaigns. In this way, a detailed threat agent profiling can be  performed. This task has not been performed in this report. However, it will be subject of prospective ENISA activities in  detailed threat/risk assessments.  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE FOR 5G NETWORKS  December 2020  120  8. RECOMMENDATIONS/  CONCLUSIONS  8.1 RECOMMENDATIONS  Based on the assets, threats and the state-of-play of current developments, the following  recommendations/courses of actions can be made for various stakeholders of the 5G  ecosystem:  Recommended courses of action at EU level (e.g. Member States, European Commission  and ENISA)   It is essential that the EU continues to facilitate the definition of common security standards  across for 5G Networks and its use cases by supporting further cooperation and  information sharing among Member States.   The existing EU 5G observatory93 is a very useful/important resource for dissemination of  content related to 5G, in support of activities of EU 5G Stakeholders. It covers  developments in various areas of 5G, such as status of 5G deployments, relevant MS-  actions, market uptakes, economic aspects of 5G infrastructure development, etc. Besides  this information offering, it is recommended to collect cybersecurity-related market  information, such as the status of specifications, and certification activities, more  systematically, through the appropriate mechanism or forum.   Relevant work of stakeholders (e.g. Member States, MNOs, etc.) regarding prioritisation of  implementation, service criticality assessments, security requirements, etc. should be  consolidated and made available to the 5G community. This could be one of the tasks of  the 5G observatory mentioned above.   It is important to deliver developed CTI in a form that can be more easily utilised by  interested stakeholders. A possible way to achieve this can be by means of a 5G CTI  repository offering querying facilities based on various criteria (i.e. such as threat exposure,  vulnerabilities per asset type, threats per attacker type, mapping of roles and assets, etc.).   In orchestration with the above-mentioned recommendations, critical 5G services should be  identified and implemented. Main objective of this action is could be to develop a security  assurance scheme that could drive certifications on 5G equipment, software and  processes. In all cases, a risk-based approach should be followed. CTI provided within this  report should be adapted where necessary and taken into account within the risk  assessment and the evaluation of attacker potential.   As the proliferation of AI algorithms has reached components used in the 5G ecosystem, it  is proposed to assess the threat exposure such functions throughout the components of  the entire 5G ecosystem (devices, EPROMs, software, sensors, actuators, etc.). This  activity overlaps with current ENISA work on an AI Threat Landscape, whereas a more  deep assessment w.r.t. 5G could be done in prospective versions of the 5G Threat  Landscape, when more information about such functions will be available.   Through the performed threat analysis, it has been recognised that some work needs to be  done in the area of 5G threat agent profiling and in the identification of possible attack  vectors. Given the rudimentary information available for both topics and the level of  93 https://5gobservatory.eu, accessed November 2020.  https://5gobservatory.eu/  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE FOR 5G NETWORKS  December 2020  121  available information processed (mainly specification level), at this point of time a profiling  would be premature. Nonetheless, this work is considered as a priority for future versions  of the 5G Threat Landscape, given the availability of more information on both threat  agents and attack vectors.  Recommendations for 5G market stakeholders (e.g. vendors, MNOs, Operators of  Services, Standardisation Bodies, 5G Test Labs, etc.)   More detailed mappings of asset/role responsibilities and vulnerabilities/threats could  enhance the utilisation of the produced CTI. This process could be steered by means of  identified priorities and asset criticalities assessed via market analysis, stakeholder surveys  and 5G rollout activities of MNOs.   A detailed cap analysis for the protection of various 5G assets needs to be performed.  Besides organisational issues, such a gap analysis will be needed for  migration/implementation options.   The specification of 5G provides a solid basis for the security of the entire system.  Nonetheless, the final security level will heavily depend on implementation/coding  practices. The development of good practices/guidelines for the secure implementation of  network functions is an important step towards maintaining the security level of the  specification in the resulting code-base. Such guidelines do not yet exist.   The terminology used in various published 5G documents (specifications, standardisation  documentation, research projects, etc.) needs to be consolidated. This will facilitate  homogeneity in references to important security concepts (e.g. threats, vulnerabilities,  impact, responsibilities, stakeholders, etc.) and will contribute to an elevation of  understanding and utilization of the produced material.   Some operational, general-purpose process models and frameworks do exist in the area of  telecommunication. They cover network management, vendor and security assurance  processes. Though making up a very good starting point for 5G infrastructures, they might  entail gaps w.r.t. specialised 5G operational issues. It is proposed to perform a systematic  gap analysis of these frameworks to test their 5G adequacy and fill the identified gaps.  Recommendations for national competent bodies in the area of 5G cybersecurity (e.g.  NRAs, NCSCs, National 5G Test Centres, etc.)   With guidance from current 5G deployments (including migration options), more exhaustive  gap analysis on various areas of cybersecurity measures, should be performed. This  information will contribute to the advancement of current cybersecurity practices. The  delivered CTI of this report can serve as key input towards a risk and threat based  approach.  While the above may be advisable future actions for various stakeholder groups, ENISA  envisages an involvement in the following actions e.g. on behalf/on request of EU, MS   It is important to deliver developed CTI in a form that can be more easily utilised by  interested stakeholders. A possible way to achieve this can be by means of a 5G CTI  repository offering querying facilities based on various criteria (i.e. such as threat exposure,  vulnerabilities per asset type, threats per attacker type, mapping of roles and assets, etc.).   Fostering the use of the released CTI within implementation projects and establishment of  feedback will be an important element for the improvement of the presented material and  enhancement of 5G technical and operational cybersecurity.   Performance of risk assessments for specific parts of the 5G infrastructure will lead to  better utilisation of the information delivered in the present report and will reveal areas of  improvement of the provided analysis. A pilot on a security assurance scheme for  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE FOR 5G NETWORKS  December 2020  122  certification of identification service is planned by ENISA for the coming semester.  Information from the present report will flow into this activity during the risk assessment  phase.   Besides integrating feedback from implementations, processes and detailed assessments,  prospective versions of the 5G threat landscape need to be linked to planned versions of  5G specification activities, in particular regarding the work of 3GPP group.  8.2 CONCLUSIONS  Having reached a good degree of comprehensiveness and detail within this version of the 5G  Threat Landscape, it is proposed to put the focus on utilization within upcoming activities at EU  level, Member States and MNOs. By means of the identified recommendations, this objective  can be achieved. Just as in the previous edition of the 5G Threat Landscape, it will be important  to use this material in various stakeholder activities, identify current and future developments  and try to accommodate those in future versions of the present report.  Such activities, if performed in a coordinated manner, will speed up implementation of  measures developed by various actors (i.e. EU toolbox measures, specified security measures,  development of 5G good practices for operation and security assurance).  ENISA will continue engaging within cybersecurity activities of 5G. Coordination with EU-wide  activities will be key to the success of this attempt.  Future ENISA actions on this matter will be agreed upon, mandated and coordinated with  European Commission and Member States (NIS CG SG on 5G) as deemed necessary.

[Security-02]  Virtualisation vulnerabilities of relevant MEC components  Vulnerable  virtualisation /  container /  micro-service  environment  Security risks and concerns around  virtual IT systems can be broadly  classified into three types:  1.  Architectural: The layer of abstraction  between physical hardware and  virtualized systems running IT services is  a potential target for attack. A VM or  group of VMs connected to the same  network can be the target of attacks from  other VMs on the network. 2. Hypervisor  software: The most important software in  a virtual IT system is the hypervisor. Any  security vulnerability in the hypervisor  and associated infrastructure and  management software / tools puts VMs at  risk. 3. Configuration: Given the ease of  cloning and copying images in a virtual  environment, a new infrastructure can be  deployed very easily. This introduces  configuration drift. As a result, controlling  and accounting for rapidly deployed  environments becomes a critical task.  Virtual  infrastr.,  Virtual  Infrastr.  manager  (VIM)  Best Practices for  Mitigating Risks in  Virtualized  Environments  The design should take into account the  appropriate logical segregation of  instances that contain sensitive data.  During implementation, extensive  assessment of the vulnerability of the  virtualization components is mandatory.  The underlying virtualization platform  should be hardened using vendor- provided guidelines and/or third-party  tools. In a virtualized environment, robust  key management is essential to access  control and proof of ownership for both  data and keys. Role-based access  policies should be enforced to enable  segregation of duties and data. Proper  VM encryption is required to significantly  reduce the risk associated with user  access to physical servers and storage  containing sensitive data.

INTRODUCTION  This report is an update of the ENISA 5G Threat Landscape, published in its first edition in  20191. This document is a major update of the previous edition. It encompasses all novelties  introduced, it captures developments in the 5G architecture and it summarizes information  found in standardisation documents related to 5G. Moreover, the vulnerability and threat  assessments found in this document introduce a significant advancement to the previous  edition, by providing more comprehensive information about the exposure of assets of the  updated 5G architecture.  Beyond these changes, some additional elements have been taken into account. Firstly,  implementation/migration options of a gradual migration to 5G from 4G have been taken into  account. Secondly, security issues of operational processes have been considered. These two  changes enlarge the scope of the assessment and include important parts for the enhancement  of operational security.  For all these elements, this report provides a vulnerability analysis, indicating how these  vulnerabilities can be exploited through cyberthreats and how this exploitation can be mitigated  through security controls. The assessed vulnerabilities are consolidated from various sources,  including main 5G standardisation documents and telecommunication best practices (3GPP,  ITU, ETSI, ISO, NIST and GSMA). A consolidation and mapping of cyberthreats used in these  standards has also been performed. Clearly, the complexity of 5G infrastructure and the  dependencies of assets, controls and threats is reflected in the complexity of the produced  information. ENISA would like to develop a tool-based version of this information, so that users  of the material can better navigate this complex information in a more efficient way than the  static, highly interlinked tables presented in this report. This task will be accounted for in the  near future.  The performed assessments in this report are based on specifications of 5G infrastructure, thus  potentially having a certain “distance” from actual implementations. Moreover, assessed  vulnerabilities have been extrapolated from experiences of weaknesses of technical  implementations of similar non-5G components. As such, they comprise rather hypothetical  assumptions that are to be validated on the basis of implementations. ENISA states in this  document the importance of bridging the gap between functional specifications and  implemented functions. As 5G implementation are proceeding, it is important to develop ways to  check the compliance of implementations towards the specified content and feedback  information to the specification efforts. Initially, the creation of implementation guidelines may  be a useful tool to assess the quality of implementations. In addition, security assurance  methods may be a good way to support developers and/or entities that will test the compliance  of implemented 5G functions.  A good method to overcome these limitations and at the same to further advance the quality of  this and other relevant material (ENISA, European Commission, Member States, 3GPP,  BEREC, etc.) is to use it within detailed 5G threat/risk assessments in a coordinated manner.  Besides validation of the produced information, such actions will contribute towards a more  secure 5G infrastructure and have as consequence the creation of a competitive advantage of  European stakeholders in the area of 5G. At the same time, it will increase efficiency of used  resources by avoiding duplication of efforts.  1 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/enisa-threat-landscape-for-5g-networks, accessed October 2020.  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/enisa-threat-landscape-for-5g-networks  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE FOR 5G NETWORKS  December 2020  9  The authoring of this report has been performed exclusively by ENISA. It is based on Open  Source Intelligence (OSINT) collection of publicly available information. Following a desk-top  analysis of this material by an external contractor, an update of the 5G architecture has been  performed by ENISA, vulnerabilities have been collected and consolidated and threat exposure  has been assessed. Mitigation controls found in publicly available documents have been  associated to the identified exposure, leading to a reduction of attack surface. An ad-hock  expert group consisting of 5G experts has contributed on an ad-personam basis and has  supported the work of ENISA. Their contributions were towards information collection and  knowledge transfer in the subject matter. Their contributions has been considered and compiled  by ENISA using it as an input.  For the time being, the material presented in this report aims at supporting various stakeholders  understanding the relevant vulnerabilities and cyberthreats resulting to an exposure of 5G  assets by exploiting the vulnerabilities. When requested, ENISA is in the position to support  stakeholders ‘drilling down’ the analysis further, by including granular details from the  components in focus, and examine the relevance of the assessed cyberthreats and the  efficiency of developed security measures.  1.1 POLICY CONTEXT  In January 2020, the European Commission has issued a communication calling Member  States to take steps to implement the set of measures recommended in the 5G toolbox2,3. In  June 2020, a “Report on Member States’ Progress in Implementing the EU Toolbox on 5G  Cybersecurity7” has been published NIS Cooperation Group with the objective to provide an  overview of the state of play of the ongoing toolbox implementation process by Member States  as of June 2020.  The present report contributes to the implementation of 5G toolbox measures (SMs, TMs) and  supporting actions (SAs). Its main contribution is supporting action 9 (SA09), stating “Consider  the use of existing cooperation, coordination and information sharing mechanisms, including  actions and support by ENISA, notably through regular threat assessments”. Moreover, by  providing all details about vulnerabilities, threats, security requirements and mitigation controls,  this document builds the basis for performing technical risk assessments for various sub-  systems and components of the 5G architecture, by delivering input to identify the main  technical “risk factors” for 5G.  Since the adoption of the EU 5G Toolbox in January 2020 and the publication of Member States  progress report of the implementation June 20204, Member States had paid increasing attention  to the implementation of SM05 and SM06. The purpose of SM05 and SM06 is to ensure  resilience through diversity while addressing risk R4 at individual MNO level and national level.  However it is essential to recognize that the updated ENISA 5G Threat Landscape report has  not been revised to the extent that it can provide Member States with guidance on how to  implement SM05 and SM06. This is due to the fact that this report does not specify all relevant  assets in the 5G ecosystem supply chain (devices, cloud and network assets) and objective  criteria for key stakeholders to assess resilience and diversity in the context of SM06.  Furthermore, the current report does not provide a set of common mitigation methods to  proportionally apply across the 5G ecosystem and key stakeholders, at national (SM06 such as  issues of number of MNO, network sharing) or at individual network level (SM05).  Consequently, it is not possible from this report to make conclusions about how to consistently  and proportionally implement mitigations across EU. Within this report, supporting actions SA03  2 https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/secure-5g-deployment-eu-implementing-eu-toolbox-communication- commission, accessed October 2020.  3 https://ec.europa.eu/newsroom/dae/document.cfm?doc_id=64468, accessed October 2020.  4 https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/IP_20_1378, accessed November 2020.  To better  understand the  cyber-threats  affecting 5G  Networks, it is  essential to know  the vulnerabilities  and weaknesses  of assets,  assessing thus  their attack  surface and how  it can be  exploited by  malicious actors.  https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/secure-5g-deployment-eu-implementing-eu-toolbox-communication-commission https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/secure-5g-deployment-eu-implementing-eu-toolbox-communication-commission https://ec.europa.eu/newsroom/dae/document.cfm?doc_id=64468 https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/IP_20_1378  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE FOR 5G NETWORKS  December 2020  10  and SA04 are extensively covered (by numerous contributing to TM01, and TM02, as indicated  in the mapping found in the vulnerability assessment).  Moreover, in the new ENISA regulation, the need to analyse current and emerging risks is  expressed. In line with this role, ENISA regulation stipulates that: “the Agency should, in  cooperation with Member States and, as appropriate, with statistical bodies and others, collect  relevant information”5. More specifically, it is stated that it should “enable effective responses to  current and emerging network and information security risks and threats”6.  Therefore, the ENISA 5G Threat Landscape aims at contributing to the EU Cybersecurity  Strategy and more specifically, to ongoing policy initiatives related with the security of networks  and information systems; it streamlines and consolidates available information on cyber-threats  and their evolution, thus supporting EU and national risk assessment activities.  1.2 SCOPE AND METHODOLOGY  Unlike the conditions of previous year regarding the state-of-play of 5G developments, in 2020  several national, European and international developments have led to a clearer picture of 5G  infrastructure developments at various levels. The 5G specification has done significant  progress, implementation options and migration paths from 4G to 5G have been better clarified,  relevant operational processes for 5G infrastructure have been developed and taken up and  specialized 5G functions for verticals have been specified. Moreover, at the EU level, a 5G  toolbox7 has been developed and pilots towards 5G certification schemes are envisaged, in  preparation of potential requests to ENISA issued by the ECCG in the future.  This situation gives a far better visibility on the details of 5G infrastructures and is a better  starting point for updating the ENISA 5G Threat Landscape. Having regard to these  developments, the objectives, working methods and scope of this report are as follows:   The material collected and processed within this report consists of open source  resources. It covers mainly the state-of-the art of the 5G specification work, white  papers and good practices. No concrete implementations of 5G functions from  vendors, operators, etc. have been considered or analysed for the purpose of this  report.   The threat and vulnerability analysis performed is based on the extrapolation of  existing threats and vulnerabilities found in collected material. In this respect,  vulnerabilities referred in various processed documents have been “reverse-  engineered” based on their relevance to various components/assets; subsequently,  they have been grouped under the various zoom-ins and reflect the assessed  technical and operational weaknesses, as mentioned in the various standards/good  practices. It has to be noted that this is a pure desk-top exercise based on assumed  vulnerabilities and threats and is not funded by real incidents. Equivalently, threat  actors assumed in this report are rather hypothetical, as no known attacks to such  infrastructure do yet exist. For this reason, 5G attack vectors have not been taken into  account in this work.  5 https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal- content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=OJ:JOL_2013_165_R_0041_01&qid=1397226946093&from=EN, accessed November 2020.  6 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/ed-speeches/towards-a-new-role-and-mandate-for-enisa-and-ecsm, accessed  October 2020.  7 https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/cybersecurity-5g-networks-eu-toolbox-risk-mitigating-measures,  accessed October 2020.  https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=OJ:JOL_2013_165_R_0041_01&qid=1397226946093&from=EN https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=OJ:JOL_2013_165_R_0041_01&qid=1397226946093&from=EN https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/ed-speeches/towards-a-new-role-and-mandate-for-enisa-and-ecsm https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/cybersecurity-5g-networks-eu-toolbox-risk-mitigating-measures  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE FOR 5G NETWORKS  December 2020  11   The comprehensive architecture of 5G developed in the previous threat landscape  report8 has been updated to include novelties of the 3GPP specification. This work has  taken into account all details that have been available in the 5G specification work.   Implementation options – migration paths from 4G to 5G infrastructures have been  covered.   A process map has been developed showing the contribution of operational, life-cycle  and security assurance processes to the overall security of 5G infrastructures.   A detailed technical and operational vulnerability analysis has been performed for the  components of the 5G architecture. This analysis takes into account the threats  exploiting those vulnerabilities and the controls reducing exposure to these threats, as  defined by international organisations (3GPP, ETSI, GSMA, ISO, ITU, NIST).   Except from generic functions developed for verticals by 3GPP, no information about  verticals per se (e.g. Transportation, eHealth, Industrial Internet-of-things (IIoT), Smart  Environments, etc.) have been covered in this report. This is due to potential  complexity of those environments and the unavailability of information due to their  early specification, implementation and deployment stages of 5G verticals.   Detailed information and security requirements for various functions and interfaces are  included in this report, mainly via the annexes detailing the assessed vulnerabilities.  They cover security requirements, mitigation controls, involved stakeholders and  references to related specifications and the EU toolbox measures. Moreover, the  threats used in various reports have been consolidated by means of the threat  taxonomy delivered in this report.   The scope of this report is in line with work developed by ENISA, in particular, the 5G  Threat Landscape in its 2019 edition8, and it also coherent to ENISA deliverables in  the area of 5G Standardisation.   The development of this report followed a ‘best-effort’ approach. The collected  information is not exhaustive but representative of the matters covered.   To collect relevant technical material and available 5G knowledge, ENISA has  maintained an ad hoc expert group consisting of skilled individuals in the area of 5G.  The selection of experts has been made based on technical experience of the selected  individuals, acting ad personam. A member of the team is an active member (co-chair)  of the 3GPP security sub-group and has acted as an interface between ENISA and  3GPP. The selection has aimed at covering detailed technical 5G knowledge skills  from the most representative stakeholder types that are currently engaged in 5G  activities.   The content of this report was restricted to components/matters found in relevant  open-source material covering the entire specification, security requirements and  research results related to 5G network functions (NFs). The presented material has  been put together by ENISA.  8 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/enisa-threat-landscape-for-5g-networks, accessed October 2020.  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/enisa-threat-landscape-for-5g-networks  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE FOR 5G NETWORKS  December 2020  12   Issues regarding Law Enforcement Agencies (LEA) and Lawful Interception (LI) have  not been covered in this document, apart from a reference in the threat taxonomy and  few references found in 3GPP specifications, both kept for the shake of completeness.   This report addresses in detail all technical aspects of 5G networks and related threats  emerging from the collected material (e.g. 3GPP specification, standards, good-  practices). It does not cover non-technical threats (i.e. geopolitical), such as threats  leading to regulatory risks or risks of interference from third countries through the  supply chain.  The method adopted for this study is in line with the methodology developed by ENISA for the  preparation of its annual Cyberthreat Landscape. According to this methodology, the process  requires an initial identification of relevant assets within the architecture before performing a  vulnerability and a threat assessment, which evaluates the different levels of asset exposure.  Finally, by assigning security controls to the exploitable vulnerabilities, it reduces the threat  surface of relevant assets.  The elements of cyberthreats and the relationship to risks are graphically depicted inFigure 1.  The report describes the different relationships between assets, threats and threat agents. In  future versions of this report, we will cover vulnerabilities and countermeasures (mitigation  measures/security controls).  Figure 1: Methodology adopted based on ISO 27005  Threats play a central role in a risk assessment, especially when considering the different  components of risks. The ISO 27005, a widely adopted risk management standard, defines that  risks emerge when: “Threats abuse vulnerabilities of assets to generate harm for the  organisation”9.  Following this methodology, we have identified assets, threats and threat agents. These  constitute the core of the 5G Threat Landscape presented in this report. Furthermore, the  identification and analysis of assets and cyber-threats are based on the study of specifications,  white papers and literature, without attempting any interpretation/evaluation of the assumptions  stated in these reports. It has to be noted, that the logical relationship between Threat Agents  9 https://www.iso.org/standard/75281.html, accessed October 2020.  Owners  Countermeasures  Vulnerabilities  Attack vectors  Threat agents Threats  Risks  Assets  Value  Wish to minimize  Impose  May be aware of  Reduce  That may be  reduced by  That may  possess  Based on  (set of)  That  exploit  Give  Rise to  Wish to abuse and/or may damage  To  That increase  Leading to  https://www.iso.org/standard/75281.html  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE FOR 5G NETWORKS  December 2020  13  and Attack Vectors has not been implemented in this document for the reasons: a) the threat  agent profiles are still very rudimentary and b) attack vectors in the area of 5G are unknown,  while any assumptions on attack vectors based on specified functions (3GPP) would be  premature.  1.3 TARGET AUDIENCE  Main purpose of this report is to provide knowledge and information on 5G cybersecurity issues  to the relevant community. This information may be useful to a variety of target groups:   Non-technical stakeholders such as policy-makers, regulators, law enforcement: this  target group may find this report useful to understand the current state of specification  work, the overall architecture of 5G, the emerging vulnerabilities and threats and  respective mitigation practices and measures. For example, the threat landscape  identified in this report may support policy actions in the areas of 5G networks, SDN,  NFV, cybersecurity, critical infrastructure protection, and other sectors/verticals that plan  to use the 5G Network.   Experts working in the telecommunication sector, such as operators, vendors, and  service providers: this target group may find this report useful to carry out detailed threat  analyses and risk assessments in accordance with their particular needs and mandate  (e.g., protect a specific number of components based on asset impact analysis, respond  to specific vulnerabilities with customized mitigation measures among others).   Businesses, consultants, product developers: this target group can draw valuable  conclusions from the developed analysis and material for their offerings (products,  services). This can have the form of demonstrating how vulnerabilities have been  eliminated by using developed defences, use of the material within customer projects, or  use the material as a benchmark for defining cybersecurity protection policies for such  infrastructures (e.g. for the development of verticals). Moreover, the developed material  can be used in developing security audits for 5G infrastructures.   Experts in research and innovation: the presented material provides a detailed view on  security issues of 5G. This target group may use this material as basis for gap analysis,  as material to evaluate the impact of research and as source for innovation actions with  regard to the further development and implementation. Finally, this target group may use  this material as a useful resource for numerous academic activities, such as teaching,  research, support of scholars, etc.  Beyond these main target groups, some individual parts of the information provided in this  report may be useful to a further number of target groups. For example, the assessed  vulnerabilities – as a consolidation from various sources - may be a valuable resource for  standardisation work in order to check the completeness of already performed assessments.  Moreover, the provided material may be used within risk assessment within certification  activities, providing information about the threat exposure, as well threat actor motives and  objectives. Finally, both the 5G asset inventory and the 5G threat taxonomy can be used as-is  or further developed by any stakeholders in performing their own vulnerability, threat and risk  assessments.  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE FOR 5G NETWORKS  December 2020  14  1.4 STRUCTURE OF THE REPORT  This report presents the results of the performed vulnerability and threat assessment work in  the following manner   Chapter 2 presents the stakeholders having a role in all phases of 5G implementation,  covering specification, development, deployment, operation and supervision of the 5G  infrastructure. They constitute an essential part of the 5G ecosystem. The identified,  stakeholders carry the main responsibility for the implementation and management of  cybersecurity controls, thus being responsible for mitigating the threats identified in this  report.   Chapter 3 presents the architectural framework of 5G technology by offering a generic  architecture. By means of ‘Zoom-ins’ it provides details of various components,  including introduced novelties and an overview of security considerations. These  details will contribute to the process of identifying the critical assets of the technology.   Chapter 4 presents the results of the vulnerability assessment of for each zoom-in. It  presents vulnerability groups affecting the assets of each particular zoom-in. It  provides an overview of the detailed vulnerabilities presented in the annexes (Annexes  C-M) of this report. While this chapter provides an overview of vulnerability groups per  zoom-in, the detailed information embraces detailed vulnerabilities, associated with  threats, mitigation controls and references to corresponding collected material,   Chapter 5 presents the 5G asset inventory. It consists of a collection of important  assets drawn for the components presented in the zoom-ins in the form of a mind map  available in Annex A. The assets inventory contains assets whose vulnerabilities have  been assessed in the previous chapter.   Chapter 6 presents an overview of the assessed cyber-threats. Interrelated threats  have been grouped to form a taxonomy that is presented as a detailed mind map in  Annex B.   Chapter 7 provides information on threat agents. It is a first approach towards the  assessment of potential motives emerging from the abuse/misuse of 5G assets.   Chapter 8 provides recommendations and conclusions drawn from the threat analysis.  The detailed vulnerabilities, emerging security requirements, corresponding threat groups  exploring them, and mitigation controls are presented in the Annexes. The material used in the  analysis produced for this report, which is referenced in footnotes through URLs, was last  accessed on the day of publication of this study. The referenced material will help interested  readers to dive into further detail in the complexity of the 5G infrastructure when needed.  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE FOR 5G NETWORKS  December 2020  15  2. 5G STAKEHOLDERS  2.1 STAKEHOLDERS MAPPING  The stakeholders of the 5G ecosystem have not considerably changed since the previous  edition of the 5G Threat Landscape. However, by going into some additional details, one could  amend the list of stakeholders to include some additional ones that will have a role in the 5G  ecosystem, firstly due to the inclusion of processes in the scope, and secondly by reaching a  degree of detail that may potentially motivate other stakeholders to take action in 5G.  Stakeholders will play different roles in the 5G ecosystem. Among other things, these entities  will be responsible for assuring the security of the network at different levels and in separate  layers. According to the 5G-PPP White Paper on the architecture,10 the list of stakeholder roles  in the 5G ecosystem is the following:   Service customers (SC);   Service providers (SP);   Mobile Network Operators (MNO) also known as Network Operators (NOP);   Virtualisation Infrastructure Service Providers (VISP) and   Data Centre Providers (DCSP).  In the meantime, 5GPPP has issued a very comprehensive and detailed collection of 5G  stakeholders. The graph can be found here11. The provided stakeholder groups and the detail  list of organisation types provide the full picture of entities engaging in the 5G ecosystem,  including private, governmental and international organisations.  The major stakeholder roles remained the same as in the previous 5G Threat Landscape  edition. These were:   Network infrastructure providers;   National Regulators (NRAs);   Information sharing and analysis centres (ISACs);   National cybersecurity coordinators/agencies/centres (NCSCs);   National 5G Test Centres (NTCs);   National Certification Authorities (NCAs) and   Competent EU institutions, European Commission Services, Agencies, Bodies,  Committees and Groups (including NIS-CG, ECCG, ECSO, ENISA and BEREC).  Interested readers that would like to revisit the role of the above stakeholders in the 5G  ecosystem, may revisit the previous 5G Threat Landscape edition8.  Some additional roles encountered in the collected material are worth mentioning at this point.  The importance of these roles has emerged through a better understanding of 5G  implementation and roll-out details on the one hand, but also from additional operational and  organisational needs w.r.t. 5G in shorter and longer term. These roles are:   International standardisation bodies holding an obvious role in the development of  open, publicly available and traceable 5G standards;  10 https://5g-ppp.eu/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/5G-PPP-5G-Architecture-White-Paper_final.pdf, accessed October 2020.  11 https://5g-ppp.eu/revised-5g-ppp-stakeholders-picture-and-glossary/, accessed October 2020.  https://5g-ppp.eu/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/5G-PPP-5G-Architecture-White-Paper_final.pdf https://5g-ppp.eu/revised-5g-ppp-stakeholders-picture-and-glossary/  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE FOR 5G NETWORKS  December 2020  16   Accreditation bodies will be active in the assurance of security  capabilities/requirements of accredited entities (e.g. 5G test-labs, auditors, skills, etc.);   Accredited 5G labs taking over testing and certification of 5G related components;   Telco/5G related professional organisations/associations developing good practices for  5G cybersecurity policies at technical and organisational level;   Audit organizations developing audit-guidelines for 5G infrastructures, services and  operation;   Research organisations contributing to R&D tasks related with all kinds of innovation  actions in the areas related to 5G, including verticals and   Open source organisations providing technological support and guidance in the  development of 5G functions and services.  When assuming these roles, the entities mentioned above should have different levels of  concern regarding 5G assets, among other things carrying responsibility for the risk mitigation  pertinent to the assets of concern. Although all above stakeholders do play a role in the 5G  ecosystem, their engagement emerges on a rather ad-hoc manner in current 5G activities.  When a more systematic description of activity-engagement is available, a more systematic role  mapping will be beneficial for a clearer assignment of responsibilities and a better coordination  of their actions.  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE FOR 5G NETWORKS  December 2020  17  3. 5G NETWORK DESIGN AND  ARCHITECTURE  This chapter is an update of the 5G Architecture of the 2019 5G Threat Landscape report12.  Main source of the changes of the 5G architecture is progress made in the 3GPP specification  work as it is documented in the recent version (3GPP Release 16).  Just as in the 2019’s landscape, this chapter consists of a generic 5G architecture and provides  the details of individual key components by means of ‘Zoom-ins’, allowing further detailing of  their functionality and purpose. By doing so - besides the generic 5G architecture depicted - a  number of detailed views of particular components is being presented, namely: Core Network,  Management and Network Orchestrator (MANO), Radio Access Network (RAN), Network  Function Virtualisation (NFV), Software Defined Network (SDN), Multi-access Edge Computing  (MEC), User Equipment (UE), Security Architecture (SA) and 5G Physical Infrastructure  components. These zoom-ins have been adopted from the previous version of the 5G Threat  Landscape and have been updated according to the progress of the specification work.  In this year’s version, some additional zoom-ins have been developed, in particular a zoom-in  dedicated to implementation options and a zoom-in on processes. These zoom-ins capture  some additional elements adopted/developed during 2020 that capture i) the migration options  of 5G infrastructure and ii) a process map with the relevant processes for the procurement,  development and maintenance of 5G infrastructure. In contrast to the rest of the presented  zoom-ins, the process map consists solely of various processes. We have included this zoom-in  in the 5G architecture in order to ensure a unified way of addressing vulnerabilities and threats  for pertinent to matters related to processes.  An additional element introduced for each zoom-in are two sections, one describing the  novelties established in 2020, and a second presenting security considerations related to  components of each zoom-in. While the former provides a summary of the performed changes,  the latter establishes a “bridge” to the vulnerabilities chapter (see chapter 4).  Not all components of 5G architecture have undergone changes. For the sake of completeness,  however, unchanged components of the previous 5G Threat Landscape version are repeated in  this document. They are amended with the introduced changes (marked with blue text). This  redundancy has been introduced in order to make the presented content self-contained and  facilitate reading.  Just as in the 5G Threat Landscape of 2019, in order to deal with complexity both at the level of  the generic 5G architecture and individual zoom-ins, the details of the various interfaces and  protocols have not been considered. A short description of the purpose and functionality is  provided in a separate table for each individual component. A generic 5G architecture and the  corresponding zoom-ins facilitate the identification of assets presented in chapter 5.  12 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/enisa-threat-landscape-for-5g-networks, accessed October 2020.  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/enisa-threat-landscape-for-5g-networks  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE FOR 5G NETWORKS  December 2020  18  3.1 5G USE CASES  The 5G architecture supports the various use-cases of this infrastructure, as these have been  envisaged in the 3GPP specification. An understanding of these use-cases provides the context  of use for various supported functions and architectural decisions met within the 3GPP group.  The new release 16 introduces new concepts and changes to the technical specifications of 5G  mobile networks. The work of the various 3GPP working groups resulted in the completion of  the 5G NR specifications for standalone (SA) mode. An important feature of this release is to  leverage the LTE core network to support the expansion of the 5G Network. The release 16 is  all about incrementing enhancements for mobile broadband in various requirements such as  coverage, latency, capacity, mobility, power, reliability, ease of deployment, among others.  Another core improvement with release 16 is the support to new use cases.  This has led to an enrichment of use-cases. While the previous edition of the 5G specification  envisaged the use cases: i) Enhanced mobile broadband (eMBB), ii) Ultra-reliable low latency  communication (URLLC) and iii) Machine Type Communications (MTC), the current version  enlarges significantly the scope by taking into account some verticals. The table below provides  an overview of those verticals.  Table 1: 5G Deployment Scenarios  Deployment Scenarios  Intelligent transportation systems (ITS) and vehicle-to-anything (V2X) communications  One example of a mission-critical use case is the transport system. The use of the 5G Network to enhance  automotive safety is another focus area of release 16. It includes several enhancements in support to  cellular-vehicle-to-everything (C-V2X) communications and intelligent transportation systems (ITS). The  improvements in C-V2X specification include vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V), vehicle-to-pedestrian (V2P), and  vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communications. These are all required to increase transport safety in the  current environment but also in the future implementation of autonomous driving. Intelligent transportation  systems are another major vertical focus area in release 16. This vertical area will provide a wide range of  transport and traffic-management use cases to the network.13  Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) and ultra-reliable low latency communication (URLLC)  The IIOT is also a major vertical focus area of release 16. The introduction of 5G NR into IIoT use cases will  enable the research and innovation of a future wirelessly connected and reconfigurable factory. It creates an  opportunity to introduce IIoT to support factory automation, electrical power distribution and transportation. It  introduces important enhancements in network latency and reliability. The support for time-sensitive  networking (TSN) is also included in this release, where very accurate time synchronization is essential in  factory automation use IIoT.  Integrated access and backhaul (IAB)  To expand 5G NR mmWave network coverage the cost of new fibre optics backhaul installations is typically  high and a major challenge when deploying additional base stations. Release 16 eliminates the need for this  wired backhaul, since it introduces integrated access allowing a base station to provide both wireless access  for devices and wireless backhaul connectivity.  NR-Based access to unlicensed spectrum (NR-U)  Release 16 allows 5G Networks to operate in unlicensed spectrum that is the largest available. The existing  global 5 GHz and 6 GHz unlicensed band is used by Wi-Fi and LTE LAA and is attractive use case for  increasing data rates and capacity to the network. The specifications define two operation modes: NR-U  with an anchor in licensed-assisted (shared spectrum) and standalone NR-U with only unlicensed spectrum.  13 https://www.ericsson.com/en/reports-and-papers/ericsson-technology-review/articles/5g-nr-evolution, accessed October 2020.  https://www.ericsson.com/en/reports-and-papers/ericsson-technology-review/articles/5g-nr-evolution  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE FOR 5G NETWORKS  December 2020  19  Besides these verticals, the new specification adds more than 20 standard technological  features, including a series of improvements for enhanced mobile broadband (eMBB) and  further vertical applications. These eMBB improvements cover Massive MIMO, cell interruption-  free handover, and remote interference suppression. Moreover, introduced additional  improvements may be considered as enablers that will enhance the efficiency of 5G for a series  of further applications. The table below provides a summary of those improvements/features.  Table 2: Additional 5G enabling features for all verticals  5G EFFICIENCY  Important enhancements in release 16 features can be found in the areas of multiple-input, multiple-output  (MIMO) and beamforming enhancements, dynamic spectrum sharing (DSS), dual connectivity (DC) and  carrier aggregation (CA), positioning and user equipment (UE) power saving. The most relevant 5G  efficiency improvements are as follows:  Interference mitigation  Release 16 introduces Remote Interference Mitigation (RIM) and Cross-Link Interference (CLI) features.  Base stations can communicate and coordinate (Via reference signals (RIM-RS) over-the-air or in  combination with backhaul signalling) mitigation of base station TDD DL-to-UL ducting interferences (to  indicate the presence of interference and whether enough mitigation is in place). With CLI, devices can  measure and report inter-/intra-cell interferences (Inter-cell: when devices have semi-static TDD scheduling,  Intra-cell: when devices support dynamic TDD) caused by neighbouring devices with different TDD  configurations.  MIMO Performance  Release 16 introduces MIMO enhancements including:   enhanced beam handling;   channel-state information (CSI) feedback;   support for transmission to a single UE from multiple transmission points (multi-TRP)   full-power transmission from multiple UE antennas in the uplink (UL).  Some of these enhancements are meant to increase the throughput of the network, reduce overhead,  and/or provide additional robustness.  High-precision positioning  With an increase in the number of use cases and applications requiring accurate outdoor and indoor  positioning, release 16 introduces various DL-based and UL-based positioning methods, to meet the  accuracy requirements for different use cases. The way it is operated, the network location server collects  and distributes information related to positioning of the user device (UE capabilities, assistance data,  measurements, position estimates, etc.) to the other entities involved in the positioning procedures. Single  and multi-cell positioning also brings precision geolocation in support of ITS/V2X communications and IIoT  applications (see use cases).  Power consumption  Another important aspect of release 16 is to further reduce device power consumption in user devices. For  example, the use of a wakeup signal (WUS), a low-power control channel to indicate activity or lack thereof  in the corresponding DRX (discontinuous reception) monitoring period. Others examples include optimized  low-power settings, efficient power controls, and overhead reduction, and more efficient power control  mechanisms. Smart new power-saving features help improve device battery autonomy even in high-use  applications14.  Dual connectivity and carrier aggregation (CA/DC)  Release 16 also reduces latency for CA/DC setup and activation to achieving higher data rates.  In this  case, connectivity can be resumed after periods of inactivity. Furthermore, release 16 also introduces a  triggering of CSI reference signal transmissions in case of the aggregation of carriers with different  numerology.  14 https://www.qualcomm.com/news/onq/2020/07/07/propelling-5g-forward-closer-look-3gpp-release-16?, accessed October 2020.  https://www.qualcomm.com/news/onq/2020/07/07/propelling-5g-forward-closer-look-3gpp-release-16  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE FOR 5G NETWORKS  December 2020  20  Mobility enhancements  Reduced interruption time 0ms handover enabled by dual active protocol stack with concurrent source/target  cell transmissions/reception.

Specifying device reporting needed to enhance network configurations and  inter-node information exchange (e.g., enhancements to interfaces like N2, and Xn).  Concluding this section, we would like to present the planned evolution of 5G 3GPP  specification. 5G specifications are in continuous development by the 3rd Generation  Partnership Project (3GPP). Since last year’s report, the current 5G specification is Release 16,  which reached specification freeze in July 2020, with items related to Radio Access Network  due for finalisation in December 2020. The timeline of specification development is presented  below16:  Figure 2: Timeline of 3GPP specification versions  It is considered as meaningful to plan prospective versions of the 5G Threat Landscape in order  to accommodate updates introduced by newer versions of the specification (e.g. end of 2021,  covering Release 17 Stage One, and end 2022 covering Release 17 Stage Two).  15 3GPP TR 21.916 V0.5.0 (2020-07) Technical Report 3rd Generation Partnership Project; Technical Specification Group  Services and System Aspects; Release 16 Description; Summary of Rel-16 Work Items (Release 16) -  https://www.3gpp.org/ftp/Specs/archive/21_series/21.916, accessed October 2020.  16 https://www.3gpp.org/release-16, accessed October 2020.  https://www.3gpp.org/ftp/Specs/archive/21_series/21.916 https://www.3gpp.org/release-16  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE FOR 5G NETWORKS  December 2020  21  3.2 GENERIC 5G ARCHITECTURE  In this section, we present the evolvement of the 5G architecture as resulted from the  specification updates of 3GPP Release 1627. Within this chapter, the complete architecture is  being presented, whereas novelties are marked through blue coloured text in the tables  detailing the zoom-in components. Updates have been implemented either at the level of  descriptions, or as new components introduced by the 3GPP specification Release 16. At the  level of zoom-ins, a special section describes in more details the rational and functions behind  the introduced novelties. A further section describes the security considerations relating to each  zoom-in.  Just as in the previous version of the 5G TL, the generic 5G architecture is presented through  its main components depicted as labelled boxes. These boxes have been arranged based on  layers, depicting their functional role in the 5G architecture (i.e. virtualisation layer and physical  infrastructure layer). This architecture aims at providing an overview of the main groups of  foreseen 5G functionality and is a consolidation of components/functions found in the analysed  material (e.g. 14, 19, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28).  Specifically in 5G, the architecture was designed in a way that connectivity and services can be  supported, enabling techniques such as Network Function Virtualisation (NFV), Network Slicing  (NS) and Software Defined Networking (SDN), Slicing, etc. This service-based architecture  meets multiple functional and performance requirements built upon new use cases.  The generic 5G architecture presents an overview of the various components that are further  detailed and depicted through specific ‘Zoom-ins’ in forthcoming sections. It is worth mentioning  that for the Transport and OSS components, no ‘Zoom-in’ was developed. However, they have  been included in the generic 5G architecture for consistency reasons, and relations with OSS  are detailed in the corresponding zoom-ins for NVF and Network Slicing Management.  Also, as an evolution from the first version of the architecture, in this version relevant processes  are taken into account, as MNO, Vendor and Assurance processes are consequential for the  overall security of the 5G Network. The 5G generic or high-level technical architecture is  depicted in the following figure.  Figure 3: Generic 5G Architecture  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE FOR 5G NETWORKS  December 2020  22  3.3 CORE NETWORK ARCHITECTURE (ZOOM-IN)  One of the most important innovations in the 5G architecture is the complete virtualisation of the  Core network. As an example, the ‘softwarisation’ of network functions will enable easier  portability and higher flexibility of networking systems and services (Control-User Plane  Separation, CUPS). The Software Defined Network (SDN) abstracts low-level network  functionalities to simplify network management. Network Function Virtualisation (NFV) provides  the enabling technology for placing various network functions in different network components  on the basis of performance needs/requirements; and eliminates the need for function-or  service-specific hardware. SDN and NFV, complementing each other, improve the network  elasticity, simplify network control and management, break the barrier of vendor-specific or  proprietary solutions, and are thus considered as highly important for future networks. These  novel network technologies and concepts that rely heavily on ‘softwarisation’ and virtualisation  of network functions will introduce new and complex threats. The core network is the central  part of the 5G infrastructure and enables all functions related to multi-access technologies. Its  main purpose is to deliver services over all kinds of networks (wireless, fixed, converged)  .  All in all, in the new specification Core Network has been amended with some new functions  and few components, while the overall structure remained almost unchanged. The majority of  added functions are related to localization issues and implementation of location services. In the  figure presented below, these new functions have been added. At the same time, slicing has  been omitted in the Core Network zoom-in, as it is included in a specialized zoom-in later in this  chapter. The Core network has been defined by 3GPP and its structure is as follows:  Figure 4: Core network architecture Zoom-in  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE FOR 5G NETWORKS  December 2020  23  The description of the elements of 5G Core network are as follows:  17 3GPP TS 23.501 V16.6.0 (2020-09) Technical Specification 3rd Generation Partnership Project; Technical Specification  Group Services and System Aspects; System architecture for the 5G System (5GS); Stage 2 (Release 16),  https://www.3gpp.org/ftp/Specs/archive/33_series/33.501/33501-g40.zip ,accessed October 2020.  18 https://portal.3gpp.org/desktopmodules/Specifications/SpecificationDetails.aspx?specificationId=3334, accessed October  2020.

Network Slice Selection  Function (NSSF)  The NSSF offers services to the AMF and NSSF in a different PLMN via the Nnssf  service based interface (see 3GPP TS 23.501and 3GPP TS 23.502).  Gateway Mobile Location  Centre (GMLC)20  The GMLC contains functionality required to support Location Services (LCS). In one  PLMN, there may be more than one GMLC.  A GMLC is the first node an external LCS client accesses in a PLMN. AFs and NFs may  access GMLC directly or via NEF.

The LMF receives location requests for a target UE from the serving AMF  using the Nlmf interface. The LMF interacts with the UE in order to exchange location  information applicable to UE assisted and UE based position methods and interacts  with the NG-RAN, N3IWF or TNAN in order to obtain location information.  Service Communication  Proxy (SCP)  An NF service is one type of capability exposed by an NF (NF Service Producer) to  other authorized NF (NF Service Consumer) through a service-based interface NF  services may communicate directly, or indirectly via an SCP.

The most important enhancements and  their impact on the 5G Core are presented below:  New functions are added to the 5G Core toolset, to support Network-Slice Specific  Authentication (NSSAAF), Location Services (GMLC), and enhancements to existing functions’  specification support use-cases such as cellular IoT Support, Ultra-reliable low latency  architecture, 5G LAN services, Time Sensitive Networking for Industrial IoT, Vehicle to  everything.  A significant enhancement for the Service Based Architecture is the enablement of indirect  communication and delegated discovery through the Service Communication Proxy. This  increases flexibility, allowing communication between Network Functions via Network  Repository Function (NRF) and Service Communication Proxy (SCP).  Enhancements in the network analytics exposure features is an important enabler for Network  Automation in the 5G system.  Another feature provided is Radio Capabilities Signalling (RACS) Optimization via optimized  signalling of UE Radio capabilities by introducing mapping of RACS ID to UE Radio Capability  in the network. The mapping between RACS ID to UE Radio capabilities will be stored in the  new Network Function UE (radio) Capability Management Function (UCMF) and cached in the  AMF and gNB.  The network slicing function is improved beyond network-slice specific authentication with  enhanced SMF/AMF topologies and with interworking support with the Evolved Packet System,  in view of the Non Standalone (NSA) deployments.  3.3.2 SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS  The specification of 5G Core network functions were developed as to close known  vulnerabilities in existing network. The effort is ongoing; for instance, the most recent version of  the 5G architecture specification21 further enhances the closing of a known User Plane Integrity  Protection vulnerability, by adding new requirements for the UE to support User Plane Integrity  Protection at full-rate. . The full set of security mechanisms in the 5G system is presented in the  Security Architecture section.  However, the 5G core functions rely on an underlying infrastructure of hardware, software and  processes that come with their security threats and vulnerabilities. In the NFV and SDN zoom-  ins we will address the relevant security considerations related to virtualisation, softwarisation  and associated management and orchestration mechanisms. In the Processes map section, we  discuss the relevant security considerations.  Apart from these, the following general security considerations apply:  Service-based architecture  The 5G Core functions is meant to be largely composed of applications running on general-  purpose hardware that communicate through application programming interfaces (APIs). The  21 3GPP TS 23.501 V16.6.0 (2020-09) Technical Specification 3rd Generation Partnership Project; Technical Specification  Group Services and System Aspects; System architecture for the 5G System (5GS); Stage 2 (Release 16),  https://www.3gpp.org/ftp/Specs/archive/23_series/23.501/23501-g60.zip, accessed October 2020.  https://www.3gpp.org/ftp/Specs/archive/23_series/23.501/23501-g60.zip  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE FOR 5G NETWORKS  December 2020  27  integrity of the software, especially from open-source locations and the overall software supply  chain, is an area of vulnerability. As services can be created, destroyed, and communicate with  each other dynamically, systems must be properly authenticated and communications protected  in order to prevent unauthorized execution of functions or access to data22.  Affected components: Service-based interfaces  Failure to meet General Security Assurance Requirements  The security assured by the 5G Core functions and the security of the 5G Core itself is built  upon the permanent update of Security Assurance Requirements for critical network  components such as UDM, AUSF, SEPP, NRF, NEF, SMF, AMF and UPF.  However, a security update gap between new security requirements and deployment of  updated versions of network functions in operational systems will unavoidably exist. There are  two major factors in reducing this gap: a) vendors’ responsiveness in issuing and validating new  versions of the network functions that address the updated requirements, and b) timeliness and  effectiveness of MNO processes to update operational systems to recently released and SCAS-  evaluated versions.  Affected components: UDM, AUSF, SEPP, NRF, NEF, SMF, AMF, UPF.  IP Based Protocol stack  5GC moves to an IP based protocol stack, allowing interoperability with a wider number of  services and technologies in the future. The following protocols, schemas and processes will be  adopted in 5GC:   HTTP/2 and JSON as application layer and serialization protocols, replacing Diameter  over the S6a reference point   TLS as an additional layer of protection providing encrypted communication between  all network functions (NF) inside a public land mobile network (PLMN)   TCP as the transport layer protocol   RESTful framework with OpenAPI 3.0.3 as the Interface Definition Language (IDL).  As these protocols are used in the wider IT industry it will likely lead to a shorter vulnerability to  exploitation timeline, and higher impact of vulnerabilities within these protocols. Vulnerability  reporting schemes will have to manage the increased scope of these protocols. Once located  the time to patch for vulnerabilities should be short.  Affected components: All functions  3.4 NETWORK SLICING (NS) (ZOOM-IN)  One of 5G’s key features will be the opportunity for network slicing23: enables the flexible and  efficient creation of specialized end-to-end logical networks on top of shared network  infrastructure. Network slicing belongs to the category of virtualization networking paradigm,  together with Software-Defined Networking (SDN) and Network Function Virtualization (NFV).  22 Security considerations for the 5G era, 5G Americas, July 2020, https://www.5gamericas.org/wp- content/uploads/2020/07/Security-Considerations-for-the-5G-Era-2020-WP-Lossless.pdf accessed October 2020.  23 https://www.sdxcentral.com/5g/definitions/5g-network-slicing/, accessed October 2020.  https://www.5gamericas.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Security-Considerations-for-the-5G-Era-2020-WP-Lossless.pdf https://www.5gamericas.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Security-Considerations-for-the-5G-Era-2020-WP-Lossless.pdf https://www.sdxcentral.com/5g/definitions/5g-network-slicing/  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE FOR 5G NETWORKS  December 2020  28  Network slicing can take advantage of SDN and NFV, but it can be seen as an independent  technology24.  5G system is expected to be able to provide optimized support for a variety of different  communication services, different traffic loads, and different end user communities25. A clear  benefit of 5G network slicing for operators will be the ability to tailor the functionalities and  allocation of network resources to specific customers and particular market segments.  In this update of the 5G architecture, we include in this zoom-in all interrelated slicing functions  that are located within the scope of other zoom-ins. This decision has been made in order to  have in a single picture all relevant slicing components and functions, providing thus an  integrated view.  Communication between autonomous cars, for instance, requires minimal latency (the lag time  it takes for a signal to travel), but not necessarily high throughput (the amount of data a network  can process per second) while a use-case such as augmented reality will require more  bandwidth.  Network Slicing components are presented in relation to the impacted elements of the network  architecture, as depicted in the various ‘Zoom-ins’. This cross-reference/mapping is an  alternative means for describing slice functions of 5G. The dependency of slices with the  various components of the 5G generic architecture is shown in the figure below:  Figure 5: Network slicing architecture Zoom-in  24 R. F. Olimid and G. Nencioni, \"5G Network Slicing: A Security Overview,\" in IEEE Access, vol. 8, pp. 99999-100009,  2020, doi: 10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2997702, accessed October 2020.  25 3GPP TS 28.530 V16.2.0 (2020-07) 3rd Generation Partnership Project; Technical Specification Group Services and  System Aspects; Management and orchestration; Concepts, use cases and requirements (Release 16),  https://www.3gpp.org/ftp/Specs/archive/33_series/33.501/33501-g40.zip, accessed October 2020.  https://www.3gpp.org/ftp/Specs/archive/33_series/33.501/33501-g40.zip  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE FOR 5G NETWORKS  December 2020  29  The elements of the 3GPP Slicing Management System are as follows:  Element Short description  Service Instance Layer  (Communication Services)  The Service Instance Layer represents the services (end-user service or business  services) which are to be supported. Each Communication Service is represented by a  Service Instance.  Typically services can be provided by the network operator or by 3rd parties. In line  with this, a Service Instance can either represent an operator service or a 3rd party  provided service.26.  Communication Service  Management Function  (CSMF)  This function is responsible for translating the communication service related  requirement to network slice related requirements.  The CSMF communicates with the Network Slice Management Function (NSMF).  Network Slice Management  Function (NSMF)  This function is responsible for the management (including lifecycle) of NSIs. It derives  network slice subnet related requirements from the network slice related requirements.  NSMF communicates with the NSSMF and the CSMF.  Network Slice Subnet  Management Function  (NSSMF)  This function is responsible for management and orchestration of Network Slice  Subnet Instances.  Network Slice Instance (NSI) The Network Slice is a logical network that provides specific network capabilities and  network characteristics. The Network Slice Instance is a representation of a set of  network functions and the associated resources (e.g. compute, storage and  networking resources) supporting network slice.27.  Network Slice Subnet  Instance (NSSI)  The network slice subnet represents a group of network functions (including their  corresponding resources) that form part or complete constituents of a network slice.  The grouping of the network functions allows the management of each group of  network functions to be conducted independently of the network slice.  Network Functions (NF)  Core Network Functions  (CNF)  Access Network Functions  (gNB)  A network slice instance (NSI) contains Network Functions, including the Core  Network Control Plane and User Plane Network Functions in the Home Network and  the Access Functions in the serving network28.  Release 16 of the 3GPP specification includes improved interworking with the LTE  Evolved Packet Core (EPC).  NFV MANO NFV MANO includes NFV Orchestrator (NFVO), VNF manager (VNFM) and  Virtualised infrastructure manager (VIM).  Element Management  System (EMS)  The Element Management is responsible for FCAPS management of network  functions used in the network slice instance.  Operations Support System  (OSS)  OSS functions provide management and orchestration of systems including legacy  ones and may have full end-to-end visibility of services provided by legacy network  functions in an operator's network.  Resources layer Network functions will run as software components on top of hardware infrastructure.  Virtualization enables an elastic, automated environment where network, compute and  storage services can expand, or contract as needed. Many resources can now be  hosted as software services and dynamically instantiated in different network  segments.  Management Functions  Service Based Interface  (SBI)  The management of the 3GPP network is provided by management services.

Os-Ma-nfvo The Os-Ma-nfvo reference point can be used for the interaction between 3GPP slicing  related management functions and NFV-MANO.

The trigger of NSSAA is based on subscription information from UDM and operator  policy and may be performed when UE indicates support for the feature.29  3.4.2 SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS  Security-as-a-Service  Network slices are used to deploy services at the multi-access edge across a distributed cloud  infrastructure. Network slices can be configured based upon the service-type (eMBB, mMTC,  URLLC), customer, and application to provide the required latency, bandwidth, QoS, and  security. While slices provide inherent security through segmentation, slices can also be used to  provide additional security protection and security services specific to the use case and  customer requirements.  However, although realisation of Security-as-a-Service (SECaaS) offerings is feasible technically,  it would rest ultimately with the Mobile Network Operator (MNO) to include such services in the  offer, depending on its service strategy, market context, and in relation to vertical use-cases.  Related component(s): Communication Services  End-to-end security  Network slices are end-to-end logical networks, so it is natural to aim for end-to-end security.  The concept of end-to end security is closely connected to the concepts of isolation and  orchestration. Moreover, it is dependent on the business model and on the associated trust  model.30  Release 16 introduces the mechanism of Network Slice Specific Authorisation Identifier that  enables network-slice-specific authentication and authorisation mechanisms to complement  network-side authentication mechanisms.  Related component(s): Network Slice Instance  Resource isolation  One of key expectations of network slicing is resources isolation. Each slice may be perceived  as isolated set of resources configured through the network environment and providing defined  set of functions. Level and strength of isolation may vary depending on requirements and usage  scenarios for slicing.31  29 3GPP TR 21.916 V0.5.0 (2020-07) 3rd Generation Partnership Project; Technical Specification Group Services and  ystem Aspects; Release 16 Description; Summary of Rel-16 Work Items, (Release 16),  https://www.3gpp.org/ftp/Specs/archive/21_series/21.916/, accessed October 2020.  30 R.

Technically, this means high complexity and flexibility, which bring in higher security risks.  3GPP defines requirements for management services’ security that include use of secure  communication protocols for protection of interactions at the management service interfaces  and authorisation of management service requests33, but it is to be noted the most recent 3GPP  specifications are yet to be implemented.  Another relevant issue is management of network-slice-specific log information to support post-  incident analysis. Such information may include proof of transit, remote attestation, as well as  data to support root cause analysis.  Related component(s): NSMF, NFV-MANO, Os-Ma-NFVO, SBI  Trust Model  In 5G three role models are envisaged for stakeholders.  1) The MNO owns and manages both the access and core network.  2) An MNO owns and manages the core network, the access network is shared among  multiple operators (i.e., RAN sharing).  3) Only part of the network is owned and/or managed by the MNO, with other parts being  owned and/or managed by a 3rd party.  The 3GPP appropriate APIs and management functions are needed to support this extended 3rd  party access and control of capabilities provided by the MNO, and to do so in a secure manner.  The 3rd party has increasing control over the network capabilities that support its service.  However, this control is limited to what is allowed by the MNO through the provided APIs.34  Related component(s): SBIs, Os-Ma-nfvo  32 Gutz, A Story, C Schlesinger, N Foster, inProc.1st Workshop on Hot Topicsin Software Defined Networks.

Rather, it has been integrated with the  NFV zoom in. This is because the functions used for are covered completely in the NFV zoom-  in (see section Error! Reference source not found.).  3.6 RADIO ACCESS NETWORK (RAN) (ZOOM-IN)  5G New Radio (NR) is the standard the 5G wireless air interface. 5G New Radio is set to deliver  faster and more responsive mobile broadband services and to extend mobile technology to  connect and support a multitude of new industries.  The baseline architecture described by 5G-PPP referring 3GPP Release 16 specifications on  NG-RAN identifies as a main innovation the split of the F1 interface into Centralized Unit (CU)  and Distributed Unit (DU), with a Service Data Adaptation Protocol (SDAP). The SDAP  architecture includes a Packet Data Conversion Protocol (PDCP) located in the CU and an Air  Radio Link Control (ARLC) located in the DU.  Release 16 adds integrated access and  backhaul (IAB) to the 5G toolkit. IAB allows base stations to provide both wireless access for  devices and wireless backhaul connectivity, which can replace temporarily or permanently wired  backhauls.  Another key aspect of the NG-RAN is the ability to provide small-cell coverage to multiple  operators “as-a-service” in two-tier architecture. These tiers are in support of the previously  mentioned 5G use cases providing low latency services and high processing power. The  structure of the RAN architecture is depicted in the following figure35:  Figure 6: RAN architecture Zoom-in  35 3GPP TS 38.401 V16.2.0 (2020-07), Technical Specification 3rd Generation Partnership Project; Technical Specification  Group Radio  Access Network; NG-RAN; Architecture description (Release 16),  https://www.3gpp.org/ftp/Specs/archive/38_series/38.401/, accessed October 2020.  https://www.3gpp.org/ftp/Specs/archive/38_series/38.401/  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE FOR 5G NETWORKS  December 2020  33  The elements of the RAN architecture are as follows:  Element Short description  User Equipment (UE) Allows a user access to network services. The User Equipment is subdivided into the  UICC domain and the ME (Mobile Equipment) Domain. The ME Domain can further be  subdivided into one or more Mobile Termination (MT) and Terminal Equipment (TE)  components showing the connectivity between multiple functional groups.  gNB Next generation Node/Base Station is a node providing NR user plane and control plane  protocol terminations towards the UE, and connected via the NG interface to the 5GC.  gNB Distributed Unit (gNB- DU)  gNB-DUa logical node hosting RLC, MAC and PHY layers of the gNB or en-gNB, and its  operation is partly controlled by gNB-CU. One gNB-DU supports one or multiple cells.  One cell is supported by only one gNB-DU. The gNB-DU terminates the F1 interface  connected with the gNB-CU.  gNB Central Unit (gNB-CU) gNB-Central Unit (CU) is a logical node hosting RRC, SDAP and PDCP protocols of the  gNB or RRC and PDCP protocols of the en-gNB that controls the operation of one or  more gNB-DUs. The gNB-CU terminates the F1 interface connected with the gNB-DU.  Xn Xn is a network interface between NG-RAN nodes; 3GPP TS 38.42036 specifies Xn  interface general aspects and principles.  NG interface The gNBs are connected by means of the NG interfaces to the 5G Core, more  specifically to the AMF (Access and Mobility Management Function) by means of the  NG-C interface and to the UPF (User Plane Function) by means of the NG-U interface.  NR Uu The New Radio Unified Air Interface (NR-Uu) is the radio interface between the mobile  and the radio access network.  IAB Donor gNB that provides network access to UEs via a network of backhaul and access links37.  IAB Node RAN node that supports New Radio access links to UEs and New Radio backhaul links  to parent nodes and child nodes. The IAB-node does not support backhauling via LTE.  Non Access Stratum (NAS) NAS is a functional layer in the protocol stack between UE and Core Network. (NAS)  protocol for 5G System (defined in 3GPP TS 24.501).  Access Stratum (AS) AS is a functional layer in the protocol stack between UE and RAN responsible for  transporting data over the wireless connection and managing radio resources.  F1 The F1 interface provides means for interconnecting a gNB-CU and a gNB-DU of a gNB  within an NG-RAN, or for interconnecting a gNB-CU and a gNB-DU of an en-gNB within  an E-UTRAN.  It facilitates that a gNB-CU and a gNB-DU supplied by different manufacturers can work  seamlessly38.  3.6.1 ELEMENTS OF NOVELTY  While a significant part of the Release 16 enhancements involve the 5G-RAN to a certain  extent, the following enhancements brought by Release 16 of the 3GPP specification are  directly relevant for the 5G-RAN:  36 3GPP TS 38.420 V16.0.0 (2020-07), Technical Specification, 3rd Generation Partnership Project; Technical Specification Group Radio Access  Network; NG-RAN; Xn general aspects and principles (Release 16), https://www.3gpp.org/ftp/Specs/archive/38_series/38.420, accessed October 2020.  37 3GPP TS 38.300 V16.2.0 (2020-07), Technical Specification, 3rd Generation Partnership Project; Technical Specification Group Radio Access  Network; NR; NR and NG-RAN Overall Description; Stage 2 (Release 16), https://www.3gpp.org/ftp/Specs/archive/38_series/38.300/ , accessed  October 2020  38 3GPP TS 38.470 V16.2.0 (2020-07) Technical Specification 3rd Generation Partnership Project; Technical Specification  Group Radio  Access Network; NG-RAN; F1 general aspects and principles (Release 16),  https://www.3gpp.org/ftp/Specs/archive/38_series/38.470, accessed October 2020.  https://www.3gpp.org/ftp/Specs/archive/38_series/38.420 https://www.3gpp.org/ftp/Specs/archive/38_series/38.300/ https://www.3gpp.org/ftp/Specs/archive/38_series/38.470  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE FOR 5G NETWORKS  December 2020  34  Integrated access and backhaul (IAB)  One of the major 5G challenges for operators looking to expand network coverage is the cost of  deploying base stations. The limited range of mmWave signals for fiber-optics backhaul  installations to service these base stations can make mmWave deployment cost intensive. IAB  addresses directly this issue. IAB base stations provide both wireless access for devices and  wireless backhaul connectivity, thus eliminating the need for wired backhauls. Operators may  resort to these capabilities to speed up densification, and install fiber to increase backhaul  capacity at a later time, as demand increases.  Multiple-input and multiple-output (MIMO) enhancements  MIMO multiplies a radio link’s capacity by using multiple transmission and multiple receiving  antennas. Multi-user multiple-input and multiple-output (MU-MIMO) enhancements include  support for multiple transmission and reception points (multi-TRP) and improved multi-beam  management for enhanced link reliability. Improvements also aim at reducing peak-to-average  power ratio, and improved coverage at the network’s edge.  Simplified Random Access Procedure  Release 16 introduces a simplified random access procedure. This reduces the number of  interactions between the UE and network during the connection setup and connection resume,  thereby enabling a lower control plane latency. In case of connected mode, a small amount of  data can be sent via 2-step RACH procedure thus also enabling a lower latency for UL UP data  for connected mode UEs.  Private network support for NG-RAN  The second Release 16 project aimed at expanding 5G’s reach beyond traditional public mobile  networks involves improved support in the system architecture for private networks. Private  networks utilize dedicated base stations that are independently managed, implement  customized security and privacy controls, and deliver optimizations for local applications, such  as low latency or data flow control. Private networks are directly aimed at new use cases such  as industrial IoT.  UE Power Saving  UE battery life is an important aspect of the user’s experience. The study of the Rel-16 UE  power saving had shown substantial power saving gain comparing to considered Rel-15 NR  features. The work item of UE power saving in NR includes the power saving techniques, such  as DRX adaptation, cross-slot scheduling, and maximum MIMO layer adaptation in  CONNECTED state, fast transition out of CONNECTED state, and reduced RRM (Radio  Resource Management) measurements in idle/inactive states39.  NR-Based Access to Unlicensed spectrum  To expand 5G’s reach, 3GPP completed two projects in Release 16 that are key for new  vertical use cases. One of them is 5G NR-U, that allows 5G to operate in unlicensed spectrum.  It defines two operation modes, anchored NR-U requiring an anchor in licensed or shared  spectrum and standalone NR-U that utilizes only unlicensed spectrum.  39 3GPP TR 21.916 V0.5.0 (2020-07) Technical Report 3rd Generation Partnership Project; Technical Specification Group  Services and  System Aspects; Release 16 Description; Summary of Rel-16 Work Items (Release  16),https://www.3gpp.org/ftp/Specs/archive/33_series/33.501/33501-g40.zip , accessed October 2020.  https://www.3gpp.org/ftp/Specs/archive/33_series/33.501/33501-g40.zip  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE FOR 5G NETWORKS  December 2020  35  Time sensitive networking (TSN)  As part of the effort for 5G to support new Industry 4.0 use cases such as factory automation,  5G RAN Release 16 added support for TSN integration that can ensure time-deterministic  delivery of data packets.  Precision geolocation  3GPP support location service features, to allow new and innovative location-based services to  be developed. 5G specifications make possible to identify and report the current location of the  user’s terminal and to make the information available to the user, ME, network operator, service  provider, value added service providers and for PLMN internal operations40 Enhancements in  high-precision positioning brought by 5G NR Release 16, meet accuracy targets of 3 meters  indoors and 10 meters outdoors.  3.6.2 SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS  In recent years, a large body of literature has revealed numerous security and privacy issues in  4G mobile networks. Most of the published attacks at the 4G RAN layer involve Rogue Base  Stations (RBSs) or IMSI catchers to target individual user(s) during the UE’s initial attach  procedure to the network or paging attacks using the IMSI paging feature. In such attacks, the  information obtained on IMSIs may be used later for other types of attacks41.  5G NR technologies address and close known IMSI threats, but new functionalities in the  Release 16 also bring security considerations that are subject to open studies:  Security of Ultra-Reliable Low-Latency Communication (URLLC)  URLLC needs to support both high reliability and low latency. In order to ensure the high  reliability, redundant transmission in 5GS is supported on multiple user plane data paths.  Accordingly, the applicable security mechanisms for supporting redundant transmission cover  all aspect of the communication, including PDU session establishment, handover etc. As for the  low latency aspect, the other important requirements for URLLC include QoS Monitoring to  assist URLLC service and optimization for handover procedure. The security considerations in  this case are covered as well. Additional security aspects are related to control plane and user  plane optimizations for ensuring the high reliability and reducing latency42.  Related components: gNB, interfaces: Uu, F1, Xn  Security of NR Integrated Access and Backhaul  A study is underway at 3GPP to identify potential security threats and vulnerabilities that are  applicable to the new IAB architecture43. Key security issues include Topology Discovery and  Masquerading, IAB Node Authentication to prevent connection of false IAB-node and  manipulation of Radio Link Failure recovery and security of F1 interface.  40 3GPP TS 22.071 V16.0.0 (2020-07) Technical Specification 3rd Generation Partnership Project; Technical Specification  Group Services and System Aspects; Location Services (LCS); Service description; Stage 1 (Release 16)  https://www.3gpp.org/ftp/Specs/archive/22_series/22.071, accessed October 2020.  41 Rupprecht, David & Dabrowski, Adrian & Holz, Thorsten & Weippl, Edgar & Pöpper, Christina.

This  weakness can be used by some adversary nodes to cause intentional interference and hinder  legitimate user’s communication over specific wireless channels. 5G improves resilience  against jamming attacks over the 4G LTE, but remains vulnerable to customised attacks.  Massive MIMO deployment may be vulnerable to jamming attacks44. Jamming attacks are a  special concern for mission-critical applications.  Related components: Uu  Failure to meet General Security Assurance Requirements  Security of 5G RAN is built upon the permanent update of Security Assurance Requirements for  critical network components such as gNB.  However, a security update gap between new security requirements and deployment of  updated versions of network functions in operational systems will unavoidably exist. There are  two major factors in reducing this gap: a) vendors’ responsiveness in issuing and validating new  versions of the network functions that address the updated requirements, and b) timeliness and  effectiveness of MNO processes to update operational systems to recently released and SCAS-  evaluated versions.  Affected components: gNB  3.7 NETWORK FUNCTION VIRTUALISATION (NFV) – MANO (ZOOM-IN)  NFV introduces a new concept for service providers to accelerate the deployment of new  network services in support of their revenue and growth plans. It translates to the use of  standard IT virtualisation technologies applied to the deployment of Network Functions, aiming  at a faster provision of new network services. With this, several providers formed the NFV ISG  under the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI). The foundation of NFV’s  basic requirements and architecture resulted from the work produced by ETSI NFV ISG 4546.  Although 5G networks will be very different compared to its predecessors in some regards (e.g.  through the use of virtualisation and support for diverse and critical non-telecom-oriented  services), they still share similarities and will reuse and extend existing concepts that have  proved successful and are widely adopted.  The NFV has a tight interaction with Virtual Network Functions (VNF), MANO and OSS/BSS  and security management components. The NFV ‘Zoom-in’ presented in Figure 7 refers to all  relevant Core Network and Access Network Functions, as defined by the 3GPP specification  and outlined in their respective zoom-ins.  The structure of NFV has remained almost unchanged. The updates of NFV introduced,  constitute an evolution of previous specifications and concentrate mainly in the adaptation of  functions virtualization to various requirements dictated by the needs of various components.

Also, the 3GPP Network Slicing Management system consumes management interfaces  provided by NFV MANO for purposes such as Network Slice Lifecycle Management (LCM),  Virtual Network Function LCM, Performance, Fault and Configuration Management. The structure  of NFV architecture and its interfaces to related components is shown in the following figure.  Figure 7: NFV architecture Zoom-in  The elements of the NFV architecture are as follows:  Element Short description  Operations Support  System/Business Support  System (OSS/BSS)  OSS/BSS functions provide management and orchestration of systems including  legacy ones and may have full end-to-end visibility of services provided by legacy  network functions in an operator's network.  Processes covered by OSS/BSS include: Network Management, Service delivery /  fulfilment / assurance, Customer Relationship management and Billing.  Virtualised Network  Function (VNF)  A VNF is a virtualisation of a network function in a legacy non-virtualised network.  ETSI GS NFV 001 provides a list of use cases and examples of target network  functions (NFs) for virtualisation. Functional behaviour and state of a NF are largely  independent of whether the NF is virtualised or not. The functional behaviour and the  external operational interfaces of a Physical Network Function (PNF) and a VNF are  expected to be the same.  All Core and Access Network functions in the 5G system are potential subjects of  virtualisation, in certain implementation scenarios.  Element Management  (EM)  The Element Management is responsible for:   Configuration for the network functions provided by the VNF.   Fault management for the network functions provided by the VNF.   Accounting for the usage of VNF functions.   Collecting performance measurement results for the functions provided by the VNF.   Security management for the VNF functions.  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE FOR 5G NETWORKS  December 2020  38  Element Short description  NFV Infrastructure (NFVI) The NFV Infrastructure is the totality of all hardware and software components which  build up the environment in which VNFs are deployed, managed and executed. The  NFV Infrastructure can span across several locations, i.e. places where NFVI-PoPs  are operated. The network providing connectivity between these locations is regarded  to be part of the NFV Infrastructure. From the VNF's perspective, the virtualisation  layer and the hardware resources look like a single entity providing the VNF with  desired virtualised resources.  Hardware Resources In NFV, the physical hardware resources include computing, storage and network that  provide processing, storage and connectivity to VNFs through the virtualisation layer  (e.g. hypervisor). Computing hardware is assumed to be COTS as opposed to  purpose-built hardware. Storage resources can be differentiated between shared  network attached storage (NAS) and storage that resides on the server itself.  Computing and storage resources are commonly pooled. Network resources are  comprised of switching functions, e.g. routers, and wired or wireless links.  Virtualisation Layer and  Virtualised Resources  The virtualisation layer abstracts the hardware resources and decouples the VNF  software from the underlying hardware, thus ensuring a hardware independent  lifecycle for the VNFs. In short, the virtualisation layer is responsible for: •Abstracting  and logically partitioning physical resources, commonly as a hardware abstraction  layer. •Enabling the software that implements the VNF to use the underlying  virtualised infrastructure. •Providing virtualised resources to the VNF, so that the latter  can be executed.  Virtualised Infrastructure  Manager  From NFV's point of view, virtualised infrastructure management comprises the  functionalities that are used to control and manage the interaction of a VNF with  computing, storage and network resources under its authority, as well as their  virtualisation. According to the list of hardware resources specified in the architecture,  the Virtualised Infrastructure Manager performs resource and operations  management.Multiple Virtualised Infrastructure Manager instances may be deployed.  NFV Orchestrator The NFV Orchestrator is in charge of the orchestration and management of NFV  infrastructure and software resources, and realizing network services on NFVI.  VNF Manager VNF Manager is responsible for VNF lifecycle management (e.g. instantiation, update,  query, scaling, and termination). Multiple VNF Managers may be deployed; a VNF  Manager may be deployed for each VNF, or a VNF Manager may serve multiple  VNFs.  Os-Ma-nfvo This reference point is used for exchanges between OSS/BSS and NFV Orchestrator,  and supports the following:  • Network Service Descriptor and VNF package management;  • Network Service instance lifecycle management;  • VNF lifecycle management;  • Policy management and/or enforcement for Network Service instances, VNF  instances and NFVI resources;  • Querying relevant Network Service instance and VNF instance information from  the OSS/BSS;  • Forwarding of events, accounting and usage records and performance  measurement results regarding Network Service instances, VNF instances, and  NFVI resources to OSS/BSS, as well as and information about the associations  between those instances and NFVI resources.

NOTE: This reference point is only used if the EM is aware of virtualisation.  Ve-Vnfm-vnf This reference point is used for exchanges between VNF and VNF Manager, and  supports the following:  VNF instantiation / VNF instance query / VNF instance update / VNF instance scaling  out-in, and up-down / VNF instance termination / Forwarding of configuration and  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE FOR 5G NETWORKS  December 2020  39  Element Short description  events from the VNF to the VNFM / Forwarding of configuration and events regarding  VNF, from the VNFM to the VNF / Verification that the VNF is still alive/functional.  NFVI - Virtualised  Infrastructure Manager  (Nf-Vi)  This reference point is used for: Specific assignment of virtualised resources in  response to resource allocation requests / Forwarding of virtualised resources state  information / Hardware resource configuration and state information (e.g. events)  exchange.  NFV Security Manager  (NSM)  NSM is the logical functional block for overall security management, e.g. on the behalf  of network services. In cooperation with MANO blocks dedicated to managing the  virtualised network, the policy driven NSM is specialized to manage the security on a  network service over its entire lifecycle. It covers the following functionalities:  • Security Policy Planning designs and optimizes security policies for specific  targets of protection (e.g. network services);  • Security Policy Enforcement & Validation automates the deployment and  supports lifecycle management of security functions as defined in the design  phase, then configure security policies on the security functions. In addition,  during lifetime of a network service, the validation and re- configuration/remediation of associated security policies is supported, also in  automated manner;  • NFVI Security Manager (ISM) – see below.  NFVI Security Manager  (ISM)  NFVI Security Manager is the logical function dedicated to security management in  NFVI layer. It builds and manages the security in NFVI to support NSM requests for  managing security of network services in higher layer.  Security Element  Manager (SEM)  SEM refers to Element Manager managing Security Functions.  Virtual Security Function  (VSF)  This element is a special type of VNF running on top of NFVI with tailored security  functionality (e.g. firewall, IDS/IPS, virtualised security monitoring functions like vFEP,  vTap). VSFs are mainly required to protect the other VNFs, which constitute a network  service. VSF is managed by either dedicated VNFM or generic VNFM with respect to  its lifecycle.  NFVI-based Security  Function (ISF)  This element is a security function provided by the NFV Infrastructure. It includes  virtualised security appliances or software security features (e.g. hypervisor-based  firewalls) and hardware-based security appliances/modules/features (e.g. Hardware  Security Modules, Crypto Accelerators, or Trusted Platform Modules).  Physical Security  Function (PSF)  This element is a conventionally realized security function in the physical part of the  hybrid network. Even if a telco network is virtualised, additional PSFs are still needed,  for instance to protect the NFV infrastructure (and inherently, the Network Services  running on top) as a whole. PSF is part of the non-virtualised traditional network and  not maintained by the NFVI provider, hence it is managed by the SEM instead of the  VIM.  NFVI - Virtualised  Infrastructure Manager  (NF-Vi)  This reference point is used for: specific assignment of virtualised resources in  response to resource allocation requests / Forwarding of virtualised resources state  information / Hardware resource configuration and state information (e.g. events)  exchange.  3.7.1 ELEMENTS OF NOVELTY (RELEASE 4)  The ETSI Industry Specification Group for Network Functions Virtualisation (NFV) has started working in  2019 on its next specification release, known as Release 4. Release 4 addresses several issues in the  following technical areas: the evolution of the NFV framework to support the most recent cloud, software,  and virtualization techniques; novel management architectural styles and operationalization aspects,  leveraging virtualization characteristics to simplify deployments; and increased support for automation.47  47 https://www.etsi.org/newsroom/press-releases/1652-2019-10-etsi-nfv-release-4-empowers-orchestration-and-cloud- enabled-deployments, accessed October 2020  https://www.etsi.org/newsroom/press-releases/1652-2019-10-etsi-nfv-release-4-empowers-orchestration-and-cloud-enabled-deployments https://www.etsi.org/newsroom/press-releases/1652-2019-10-etsi-nfv-release-4-empowers-orchestration-and-cloud-enabled-deployments  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE FOR 5G NETWORKS  December 2020  40  Key areas of focus for the NFV Release 4 include48:   NFVI evolution, focusing on enhancements to support lightweight virtualization technologies such  as OS containers, optimizing NFV Infrastructure (NFVI) abstraction for reducing the coupling of  VNFs to infrastructure   Enhancing NFV automation and capabilities, covering aspects such as: improving life-cycle  management and orchestration, the simplification of VNF and NS management aspects  leveraging virtualization, and handling advances in autonomous networking   Evolving the NFV-MANO (Management and Orchestration) framework, focusing primarily on  optimizing internal NFV-MANO capability exposure and usage, and on enhanced reliability and  availability   Accompanying operationalization aspects which include: the simplification of NFV to ease  development and deployment of sustainable NFV based solutions, verification and certification  procedures and mechanisms, and operationalization, integration and use of NFV with other  management and network frameworks   In addition to the above technical areas, several security hardening aspects of NFV and other  small specific technical enhancements necessary to maximize the impact of virtualization and  future NFV deployments are also expected to be part of the work programme  The \"Release 4 Definition\" lists all the new features proposed for the Release 4. Among other features that  had not been fully completed in the previous Release and have been carried over into Release 4, the list of  new features includes:   Network connectivity integration and operational for NFV   NFV-MANO automation and autonomous networks   NFV enhancements for 5G   Multi-tenancy enhancements for NFV-MANO   Service-based architecture (SBA) for NFV-MANO   VNF generic management functions, and   Continuous VNF integration  However, the current network architecture of the operators differs in critical points from the envisioned  ETSI NFV architecture. Even if NFV technologies have proven successful technologies in the IT industry,  some adaption is needed to accommodate the special needs of the telecommunications industry.  Currently, traditional network functions are coupled with underlying dedicated hardware, which are vendor  proprietary. Network virtualization migration from traditional network functions to the ETSI NFV architecture  involves restructuring infrastructure, service functions, and operation and maintenance (O&M)49.  Further consideration is needed for allocation of resources for critical infrastructure services. Sharing of  such resources may not be allowed by national regulators for considerations of availability, response time  and confidentiality.  Similarly, NFV functions part of Release 4, such as Multi-tenancy enhancements for NFV-MANO or  Continuous VNF integration, will face adoption hurdles because of national certification and authorisation  schemes.  48 NFV Release 4 Definition v0.2.0 (2020-07)  https://docbox.etsi.org/ISG/NFV/Open/Other/ReleaseDocumentation/NFV(20)000160_NFV_Release_4_Definition_v0_2_0. pdf, accessed October 2020.  49 https://www.gsma.com/futurenetworks/5g/migration-from-physical-to-virtual-network-functions-best-practices-and- lessons-learned/, accessed October 2020.  https://docbox.etsi.org/ISG/NFV/Open/Other/ReleaseDocumentation/NFV(20)000160_NFV_Release_4_Definition_v0_2_0.pdf https://docbox.etsi.org/ISG/NFV/Open/Other/ReleaseDocumentation/NFV(20)000160_NFV_Release_4_Definition_v0_2_0.pdf https://www.gsma.com/futurenetworks/5g/migration-from-physical-to-virtual-network-functions-best-practices-and-lessons-learned/ https://www.gsma.com/futurenetworks/5g/migration-from-physical-to-virtual-network-functions-best-practices-and-lessons-learned/  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE FOR 5G NETWORKS  December 2020  41  3.7.2 SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS  Virtualization  NFV benefits from the inherent security protection brought by the virtualization layer50. The security threats  associated with VNFs are the combination of the security threats on physical networking and on  virtualization technologies. VNFs run over virtual resources such as VMs and cross-contamination for  shared hardware resources is possible, in particular MNO should carefully investigate risks to operate VNF  categorized as critical with others VNF on the same physical resources. Virtualization brings with it some  new attack surface with known vulnerabilities in virtualization environments. If hypervisor is compromised,  other vulnerabilities can arise exponentially. There are potential security issues associated with NFVI,  considering some potential attack scenarios such as VM escape attack, attack on hypervisor management  interface, denial of service (DoS), DNS amplification attack.  A 3GPP Study51 considers the consequences of virtualisation on 3GPP architectures, in order to identify  threats and subsequent security requirements. To adequate security in virtualised deployments, the  underlying infrastructure needs to provide minimum security capabilities in a standardised form which can  be requested and or consumed at the 3GPP layer.  Related component(s): VIM, Virtualisation Layer, NFVI  Management Interfaces / APIs  One of the security challenges is to define the standard interface in the ETSI NFV architecture. New APIs  introduce new threat vectors. Standardisation of interfaces will address security from design phase.  Management Interfaces / APIs must have safeguards in place to avoid being manipulated in unintended  ways to cause disruption. Security challenges are related to Web/API vulnerabilities, Account compromise,  Privileged User Access, Unauthorized access, Unauthorized data/packet, Inspection / Modification of data,  compromise of MANO components. Improper enforcement of security policies, or improper updating policy  rules and data access procedures, allowing attackers to gain access to the NFV MANO module and further  perform unauthorized control for all operations.  Related component(s): Os-Ma-nfvo, Ve-Vnfm-em, Ve-Vnfm-vnf  Localisation of functions  Attacks aiming to place and migrate workload outside the legal boundaries were not possible using  traditional infrastructure. Using NFV, violation of regulatory policies and laws becomes possible by moving  one VNF from a legal location to another illegal location, because there is no mechanism to enforce geo-  restrictions.

The key concept that underpins SDNs is the logical  centralisation of network control functions by decoupling the control and packet-forwarding functionality of  the network. While SDN separates the control and forwarding planes, NFV primarily focuses on optimizing  the network services themselves. NFV complements this vision through the virtualisation of these  functionalities based on recent advances in general server and enterprise IT virtualisation. In this  document, the provisions regarding SDN threats are the ones described in the ENISA Thematic Landscape  SDN/5G52.  As previously mentioned, the fundamental concept of SDN relies on decoupling of the control  and packet forwarding functionality of the network. In classic networks, these two functionalities  were the responsibility of the forwarding devices of the network. In SDN, these two  functionalities have been separated into two functionality planes: the control plane and the data  plane. The separation of these two functionality planes in SDNs has two significant  consequences:  a) it reduces the difficulty in the configuration and alteration of the control functions of the  network, as this functionality has no longer the responsibility of the forwarding devices  of the network that tend to have proprietary implementations (e.g., operating systems),  and  b) it enables the implementation of more consistent control policies through fewer and  uniformly accessible controllers.  The typical SDN architecture, as described by the Open Networking Foundation53, is shown in  the following figure.  Figure 7: SDN architecture Zoom-in  52 ENISA Threat Landscape and Good Practice Guide for Software Defined Networks/5G  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/sdn-threat-landscape/at_download/fullReport, accessed October 2020.  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/sdn-threat-landscape/at_download/fullReport  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE FOR 5G NETWORKS  December 2020  43  The elements of the SDN architecture are as follows:  Element Short description  SDN controller SDN Controller: The SDN Controller is a logically centralized entity in charge of:  • Translating the requirements from the SDN Application layer down to the SDN  Resources and  • Providing the SDN Applications with an abstract view of the network (which may  include statistics and events).  SDN controller is the “brain” of SDN network. An SDN controller manages flow control to  the switches/routers ‘below’ (via southbound APIs) and the applications and business logic  ‘above’ (via northbound APIs) to deploy intelligent networks54.  SDN Application SDN Applications are programs that explicitly, directly, and programmatically communicate  their network requirements and desired network behaviour to the SDN Controller.  Multiple  case scenarios might be envisioned, for the position of the SDN applications in the NFV  architectural framework, such as:  • The network hardware might be a physical appliance talking to an SDN controller, or a  complete solution including multiple SDN components, such as SDN controller + SDN  application for instance;  • The VIM might be an application interfacing with an SDN controller in the NFVI - for  instance OpenStack Neutron as a VIM interfacing with an SDN controller in the NFVI;  • The SDN application might be a VNF talking to an SDN controller, being virtualised or  not. For instance, a PCRF VNF might talk to an SDN controller for some policy  management for traffic steering;  • The SDN application might be an element manager interfacing with an SDN controller  to collect some metrics or configure some parameters;  • The SDN application might be an application interfacing with an SDN controller for  instance in the OSS-BSS for tenant SDN service definitions.  SDN resources Multiple scenarios might be envisaged for the actual location of SDN resources:  • physical switch or router;  • virtual switch or router;  • e-switch, software based SDN enabled switch in a server NIC;  • switch or router as a Virtual network function (VNF).  Northbound Interface  SDN Northbound Interfaces are interfaces between SDN Applications and SDN Controllers  and typically provide abstract network views and enable direct expression of network  behaviour and requirements. This may occur at any level of abstraction (latitude) and across  different sets of functionalities (longitude). One value of SDN lies in the expectation that  these interfaces are implemented in an open, vendor-neutral and interoperable way55.  Southbound Interface  The SDN Southbound Interface is the interface defined between an SDN Controller and an  SDN Data-path, which provides at least:  • programmatic control of all forwarding operations;  • capabilities advertisement;  • statistics reporting, and  • event notification.  One value of SDN lies in the expectation that the Southbound Interface is implemented in an  open, vendor-neutral and interoperable way.  Eastbound-Westbound  Interface  This interface is implemented by the different controllers of the SDN and is used to facilitate  communications between them (Controller – Controller interface).  Control Plane (CP) The plane responsible for the control functionality of the network. Part of the network that is  assigned to control one or more SDN resources. CP instructs network devices how to treat  and forward packets. The Control Plane (CP) communicates with Data Plane (DP) of  devices using a control plane Southbound Interface (SBI).  Data Plane (DP) or  Forwarding Plane (FP)  The plane responsible for the data forwarding functionality of the network. The functionality  of this plane is realized through a set of physical network devices (network elements).  54 https://www.sdxcentral.com/networking/sdn/definitions/what-is-sdn-controller/, accessed October 2020.  55 SDN Architecture Overview https://www.opennetworking.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/SDN-architecture-overview- 1.0.pdf, accessed October 2020.  https://www.sdxcentral.com/networking/sdn/definitions/what-is-sdn-controller/ https://www.opennetworking.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/SDN-architecture-overview-1.0.pdf https://www.opennetworking.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/SDN-architecture-overview-1.0.pdf  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE FOR 5G NETWORKS  December 2020  44  3.8.1 ELEMENTS OF NOVELTY  Software-defined network (SDN) radically changes the network architecture by decoupling the  network logic from the underlying forwarding devices. This architectural change rejuvenates the  network-layer granting centralized management and programmability of the networks. From a  security perspective, SDN separates security concerns into control and data plane, and this  architectural re-composition brings up exciting opportunities and challenges. The overall  perception is that SDN capabilities will ultimately result in improved security. However, in its raw  form, SDN could potentially make networks more vulnerable to attacks and harder to protect.  Although nothing comes without risks or trade-offs, when it comes to security and SDN clearly  the security benefits of SDN outweigh security risks56.  3.8.2 SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS  Control Plane  SDN provides a logically centralized control plane to the network. The controller of the network  maintains a global view of the network and programs forwarding devices as per the policies  defined at the application layer. While initially controllers were developed as single devices,  recently there has been a shift of trend to distributed controllers with the goal of adjusting to  scalability and reliability requirements of real-world scenarios. In this case, each set of  forwarding devices is assigned to a specific instance of controllers and the controllers, follow a  Master/Slave deployment model.  Control Plane attack refers to the case where an attacker may deduce the forwarding policy of  the network just by analysing the performance metrics of a forwarding device. For example, an  input buffer may be used to identify rules, and by analysing the packet processing times, an  attacker could identify the forwarding policy.  Related component(s): Control Plane, SDN controller  Data Plane  The data plane is composed of networking equipment such as switches and routers specialized  in packet forwarding.  However, unlike traditional networks, these are just simple forwarding elements with no  embedded intelligence to take autonomous decisions. These devices communicate through  standard OpenFlow interfaces with the controller - which ensures configuration and  communication compatibility and interoperability among different devices.  A Protocol Attack refers to attacks targeting the data plane of an SDN by exploiting network  protocol vulnerabilities in the forwarding devices .  A Device Attack refers to all those attacks, where the adversary aims to exploit software or  hardware vulnerabilities of an SDN-capable switch to compromise SDN’s data plane. In this  case, an attacker may target software bugs (e.g., firmware attacks) or hardware features (e.g.,  TCAM memory) of a forwarding device.

While with an Eavesdrop Attack, the attacker aims to learn about  information exchanged between the control and data plane as part of a larger attack plot, in an  Manipulation Attack the attacker’s goal is to corrupt the network behaviour by modifying the  messages being exchanged. The Availability Attack refers to Denial of Service (DoS) attacks,  where the Southbound API is flooded with requests causing the network policy implementation  to fail. Attackers can infer flow rules in SDN from probing packets by evaluating the delay time  from probing packets and classifying them into classes. Knowing the reactive rules, attackers  can launch DoS attacks by sending numerous rule-matched packets which trigger packet-in  packets to overburden the controller.  Similar to SDN’s Southbound API, the Northbound API is susceptible to Interception, Eavesdrop  and Availability.  Attacks. While the nature of both attacks is similar, there are a few key differences:   An attacker targeting the Northbound API requires higher-level of access to the system  and is potentially sitting on the application plane. There may be cases that the  applications do not run on the same device and in that case the attack complexity may  be reduced as to Southbound API.   The impacts of a compromised Northbound API are potentially larger given that  information exchanged between the control and application plane affect network-wide  policies. Unlike Southbound API, where OpenFlow is adopted as the standard, the  Northbound API lacks any standardization. Specifically, each controller has different  specifications for the Northbound API, and this leads to insecure developments57.  Another issue that needs to be looked at is the potential exposure caused by SDN programming  languages (e.g. P4 Programming Protocol-independent Packet Processors), used to  dynamically reconfigure the network. The use of these extremely dynamic and event-based  languages increases the attack surface. Although these languages have not been considered in  the current document, it is proposed to perform a detailed analysis of their misuse potential in  prospective, more detailed threat assessments.

MEC is  located in the logical vicinity of base stations through authorised third parties willing to offer  processing and storage capabilities to subscribers of the 5G network. MEC is a novel approach  57 Software-Defined Network (SDN) Data Plane Security: Issues, Solutions and Future Directions  https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.00262.pdf, accessed October 2020.  https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.00262.pdf  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE FOR 5G NETWORKS  December 2020  46  in the 5G ecosystem that enhances mobile user experience by covering services that, in  previous generations, were using the run-time of end-user devices.  MEC provides a new ecosystem and value chain. Operators can open their Radio Access  Network (RAN) edge to authorized third-parties, allowing them to flexibly and rapidly deploy  innovative applications and services towards mobile subscribers, enterprises and vertical  segments.  Multi-access Edge Computing will enable new vertical business segments and services for  consumers and enterprise customers. Use cases include:   video analytics;   location services;   Internet-of-Things (IoT);   augmented reality;   optimized local content distribution and   data caching.  It is expected that MEC is going to emerge following the evolution of application services and  verticals and will be one of the main drivers for a wider coverage and penetration of 5G  Networks.  Besides offering these services, MEC takes an important role in the 5G infrastructure. It  possesses orchestration functions, interacts with the 5G policy component and supports  lifecycle matters of the offered applications.  By deploying various services and caching content at the network edge, Mobile core networks  are alleviated of further congestion and can efficiently serve local purposes. The structure of  MEC and its elements is shown in the figure below:  Figure 8: MEC architecture Zoom-in  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE FOR 5G NETWORKS  December 2020  47  The elements of MEC are as follows:  Element  Short description  Customer facing service  (CFS) portal  The customer facing service portal allows operators' third-party customers (e.g.  commercial enterprises) to select and order a set of MEC applications that meet  their particular needs, and to receive back service level information from the  provisioned applications.  Device application  Device applications as defined in the present document are applications in the  device (e.g. UE, laptop with internet connectivity) that have the capability to interact  with the MEC system via a user application lifecycle management proxy.  Application Client(s) Application Client is the application resident in the UE performing the client function.  Edge Enabler Client (EEC) Edge Enabler Client (EEC) provides supporting functions needed for Application  Client(s).  Functionalities of Edge Enabler Client are:  • retrieval and provisioning of configuration information to enable the exchange  of Application Data Traffic with the EAS;  • discovery of EAS available in the Edge Data Network.  Edge Configuration Server  (ECS)  Edge Configuration Server (ECS) provides supporting functions needed for the  Edge Enabler Client to connect with an EES. Functionalities of ECS are:  • Provisioning of Edge configuration information to the Edge Enabler Client.  The Edge configuration information includes the following:  o the information for the EEC to connect to the EES (e.g. service area  information applicable to LADN); and  o the information for establishing a connection with EES (such as URI).  User application lifecycle  management (LCM) proxy  The user application lifecycle management proxy allows device applications to  request on-boarding, instantiation, termination of user applications and when  supported, relocation of user applications in and out of the MEC system. It also  allows informing the device applications about the state of the user applications.  The user application lifecycle management proxy authorizes requests from device  applications in the device and interacts with the OSS and the multi-access edge  orchestrator for further processing of these requests.  Multi-access edge  orchestrator  The multi-access edge orchestrator is the core functionality in MEC system level  management, responsible for the following functions: maintaining an overall view of  the MEC system; on-boarding of application packages; selecting appropriate MEC  host(s) for application instantiation; triggering application instantiation and  termination; triggering application relocation as needed when supported.  MEC host  MEC host is an entity that contains a MEC platform and a virtualisation  infrastructure which provides compute, storage, and network resources, for the  purpose of running MEC applications.  Virtualisation infrastructure  It provides compute, storage, and network resources for the MEC applications. The  virtualisation infrastructure includes a data plane that executes the traffic rules  received by the MEC platform, and routes the traffic among applications, services,  DNS server/proxy, 3GPP network, other access networks, local networks and  external networks.  MEC platform  It is the collection of essential functionalities required to run MEC applications on a  particular virtualisation infrastructure and enable them to provide and consume MEC  services. The MEC platform can also provide services.  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE FOR 5G NETWORKS  December 2020  48  Element  Short description  Edge Enabler Server (EES) Edge Enabler Server (EES) provides supporting functions needed for EAS and  EEC. Functionalities of EES are:  • provisioning of configuration information to EEC, enabling exchange of  application data traffic with the EAS;  • supporting the functionalities of API invoker and API exposing function58 as  specified in 3GPP TS 23.222;  • interacting with 3GPP Core Network for accessing the capabilities of network  functions either directly (e.g. via PCF) or indirectly (e.g. via  SCEF/NEF/SCEF+NEF);  • support the functionalities of application context transfer;  • supports external exposure of 3GPP network capabilities to the EAS over  EES interface.  MEC applications  MEC applications are instantiated on the virtualisation infrastructure of the MEC  host, based on configuration or requests validated by the MEC management.  Edge Application Server  (EAS)  Edge Application Server (EAS) is the application server resident in the Edge Data  Network, performing the server functions. The Edge Application Server may  consume the 3GPP Core Network capabilities: invoke 3GPP Core Network function  APIs directly, invoke 3GPP Core Network capabilities through the EES or invoke the  3GPP Core Network capability through the capability exposure functions (i.e. SCEF  or NEF).  MEC service  It is a service provided via the MEC platform either by the MEC platform itself or by  a MEC application.  Service registry  In MEC, the services produced by the MEC applications are registered in the  service registry of the MEC platform – as opposed to the network functions and the  services they produce which are registered in the Network Resource Function  (NRF).  Application Data Traffic Data traffic between the application installed on the User Equipment (UE) and the  application server (EAS / MEC App).  MEC host level management  It handles the management of the MEC specific functionality of a particular MEC  host and the applications running on it. Is comprised of the MEC platform manager  and the virtualisation infrastructure manager.  MEC platform manager The MEC platform manager is responsible for the following functions:  • Managing the life cycle of applications including informing the multi-access  edge orchestrator of relevant application related events;  • Providing element management functions to the MEC platform and  • Managing the application rules and requirements.  The MEC platform manager also receives virtualised resources fault reports and  performance measurements from the virtualisation infrastructure manager for further  processing.  Virtualisation infrastructure  manager  The functionality provided by the virtualisation infrastructure manager in this ‘Zoom- in’ overlaps generally with the functionality provided by the VIM described in the  NFV ‘Zoom-in’.  3.9.1 ELEMENTS OF NOVELTY  ETSI ISG MEC and 3GPP have both worked on their own architectures for edge computing  within the boundaries of their different scopes. Their common purpose is to create an open and  standardized IT service environment for hosting and supporting third-party applications in edge  environments.

At the heart of the ETSI ISG MEC and 3GPP SA6 architectures lie the MEC Platform/Edge  Enabler Server and the MEC Applications/Edge Application Servers respectively. There is a  great degree of synergy in the two architectures on these aspects, and in the information  carried between these functional entities. ETSI GR MEC 031 will provide solution proposals and  recommendations for MEC integration into 3GPP 5G system. On the other hand, 3GPP TS  23.558 Architecture for enabling Edge Applications (Release 17) provides application layer  architecture and related procedures for enabling edge applications over 3GPP networks.  3.9.2 SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS  Virtualization and containerization  Cloud computing will leverage on multiple virtualized systems in order to optimize available  resources and deliver on its proposed benefits. Cloud native MEC provides inherent security  protection due to the isolation and containerization.   Each container performs a dedicated function, enhancing behaviour profiling and  anomaly detection.   Isolation of containers prevents spread of malware and viruses.   Decomposed software provides efficient software version updates and security patches.   Compute services in cloud-native applications are designed to be ephemeral, reducing  the attack surface.   Resiliency is gained with increased speed to start a container and horizontal scale to  dynamically respond to threats.   Segmentation with network slicing separates traffic and isolates compute resources.  However, cloud native MEC architecture is exposed to a number of threats60:   The uses of open source code, more interfaces, and new APIs introduce new threat vectors.   Shared hardware resources can result in cross-contamination.   Vulnerabilities in the shared host platform, Container-as-a-Service (CaaS) and Platform-as-  a-Service (PaaS) can impact the container security.   Containers requiring elevated privileges can cause security risk to both host as well as other  tenant containers.   Dependency upon central orchestration introduces a new threat vector.   High data volume and sessions increase risk from an attack.   Applications running in a micro-service architecture are as vulnerable to the same  attacks as traditional applications.

Related component(s): MEC Host  Application-Programming Interfaces (APIs)  Edge Applications facilitate communication between application clients and applications deployed  at the edge. The architecture enables the CAPIF (Common API Framework) to be leveraged as a  standardized means of providing and accessing APIs in the Edge Cloud. The main purpose of  CAPIF is to have a unified north bound API framework across several 3GPP functions.  Application Programming Interface (API) Security is the design, processes, and systems that  keep a web-based API responding to requests, securely processing data and functioning as  intended. Like any software, APIs can be compromised and data can be stolen. Since APIs serve  as conduits that reveal applications for third-party integration, they are susceptible to attacks.  Related component(s): 3GPP SA6 interfaces, ETSI MEC interfaces  Regulatory issues  In European countries there is specific legislation on the implementation of the NIS directive61  The goal is to protect critical infrastructure that ensure national security. A critical service should  be operated in an area with a security level compatible to this criticality.  If an operator operates in a MEC environment a regulated critical service, it will have to  demonstrate that its environment is compatible with the regulation imposed by the critical  service in the particular country of operation. Physical and logical resources should not be  shared with components which have not the same criticality. This constraint requires the right  level of isolation around the service to prevent regulation pollution to its own components and  infrastructures. A simple solution can be the complete segregation of physical resources  between the operator's MEC functions and the 3rd party ones.  Related component(s): Virtualisation infrastructure, MEC host, MEC Platform.  3.10 SECURITY ARCHITECTURE (SA) (ZOOM-IN)  The 5G security architecture consists of various network functions (NF) and components that are  responsible for securing end-to-end communications, providing authentication functions and  various other security functions. The 5G security architecture consists of components that are part  of various other architectures (“Zoom-ins” in terms of this report), acting thus in a horizontal  manner across all other architectures. In particular, security functions are securing the access of  users within the radio access network (RAN), they cover security functions in the core network  and perimeter entities (edge computing) and they provide security functions in the Network  Function Virtualization. Finally, a set of elements is covering security management functions,  audit and analytics.  The 5G security architecture is defined in 3GPP technical specification62 as spanning  complementary different domains.  61 The Directive on security of network and information systems (NIS Directive) https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single- market/en/network-and-information-security-nis-directive, accessed October 2020.  62 3GPP TS 33.501 V16.4.0 (2020-09) Security architecture and procedures for 5G system (Release 16)  https://www.3gpp.org/ftp/Specs/archive/33_series/33.501/33501-g40.zip, accessed October 2020.  https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/network-and-information-security-nis-directive https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/network-and-information-security-nis-directive https://www.3gpp.org/ftp/Specs/archive/33_series/33.501/33501-g40.zip  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE FOR 5G NETWORKS  December 2020  51   Network access security (I): the set of security features that enable a UE to authenticate  and access services via the network securely, including the 3GPP access and Non-  3GPP access, and in particularly, to protect against attacks on the (radio) interfaces. In  addition, it includes the security context delivery from SN to AN for the access security.   Network domain security (II): the set of security features that enable network nodes to  securely exchange signalling data and user plane data.   User domain security (III): the set of security features that secure the user access to  mobile equipment.   Application domain security (IV): the set of security features that enable applications in  the user domain and in the provider domain to exchange messages securely.  Application domain security is not in the scope of the present analysis.   SBA domain security (V): the set of security features that enables network functions of  the SBA architecture to securely communicate within the serving network domain and  with other network domains. Such features include network function registration,  discovery, and authorisation security aspects, as well as the protection for the service-  based interfaces.   Visibility and configurability of security (VI): the set of features that enable the user to  be informed whether a security feature is in operation or not.  The detailed structure of the 5G security architecture is shown in the following figure.  Figure 9: 5G Security architecture Zoom-in  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE FOR 5G NETWORKS  December 2020  52  The elements of the 5G security architecture are as follows:  Element Short description  Mobile Equipment (ME) ME stands for all kinds of mobile equipment that can be connected to the 5G  network. ME can be sensors, IoT components, connected autonomous systems,  eHealth devices, etc.  Universal Subscriber Identity  Module (USIM)  USIM is the SIM card of 5G.It is a platform for securing access and communication  in 5G. It is the only security module mentioned in 3GPP specification.  5G Node Base Station Central  Unit (gNB-CU)  Some security requirements for gNB-CU have been formulated by 3GPPP. Though  not a security element per se, these requirements increase the security properties  of gNB and – when implemented - are considered to be relevant to the security  architecture.  Non-3GPP Access Network Security for non-3GPP access to the 5G Core network is achieved by a procedure  using IKEv2 as defined in RFC 7296 to set up one or more IPsec ESP security  associations. The role of IKE initiator (or client) is taken by the UE, and the role of  IKE responder (or server) is taken by the N3IW.  Non-3GPP access Inter- Working Function (N3IWF)  This Network Function is responsible for interworking between untrusted non-3GPP  networks and the 5G Core. As such, the N3IWF supports both N2 and N3 based  connectivity to the core, whilst supporting IPsec connectivity towards the device.  Access and Mobility  Management Function (AMF)  The Core Access and Mobility Management Function is part of the 3GPP 5G  Architecture. Its primary tasks include registration Management, Connection  Management, Reachability Management, Mobility Management and various  function relating to security and access management and authorisation.  Security Anchor Function  (SEAF)  The SEAF will create for the primary authentication a unified anchor key KSEAF  (common for all accesses) that can be used by the UE and the serving network to  protect the subsequent communication63.  Authentication server  function (AUSF)  The Authentication server function (AUSF) shall handle authentication requests for  both, 3GPP access and non-3GPP access. The AUSF shall provide SUPI to the  VPLMN (Core Network / Serving Network) only after authentication confirmation if  authentication request with SUCI was sent by VPLMN. The AUSF shall inform the  UDM that a successful or unsuccessful authentication of a subscriber has occurred.  Authentication credential  Repository and Processing  Function (ARPF)  ARPF selects an authentication method based on subscriber identity and  configured policy and computes the authentication data and keying materials  User Data Management (UDM)  Function  Unified data management (UDM) manages network user data in a single,  centralized element. UDM is similar to the 4G network's home subscriber service  (HSS) but is cloud-native and designed for 5G specifically.  The SIDF is responsible for de-concealment of the Subscription Concealed  Identifier (SUCI) and shall fulfil the following requirements:  • The SIDF shall be a service offered by UDM;  • The SIDF shall resolve the SUPI from the SUCI based on the protection  scheme used to generate the SUCI.  Unstructured Data Repository  (UDR)  Repository for management of unstructured data, designed to manage massive and  various types of unstructured data including text, image, audio and video.  Security Edge Protection  Proxy (SEPP)  The 5G System architecture introduces a Security Edge Protection Proxy (SEPP)  as the entity sitting at the perimeter of the mobile network. The SEPP shall act as a  non-transparent proxy node.  63  https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Andreas_Kunz2/publication/319527681_Overview_of_5G_security_in_3GPP/links/59b 116d80f7e9b37434a8248/Overview-of-5G-security-in-3GPP.pdf, accessed October 2020.  https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Andreas_Kunz2/publication/319527681_Overview_of_5G_security_in_3GPP/links/59b116d80f7e9b37434a8248/Overview-of-5G-security-in-3GPP.pdf https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Andreas_Kunz2/publication/319527681_Overview_of_5G_security_in_3GPP/links/59b116d80f7e9b37434a8248/Overview-of-5G-security-in-3GPP.pdf  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE FOR 5G NETWORKS  December 2020  53  Element Short description  Network Slice Specific  Authentication and  Authorisation Function  (NSSAAF)  The Network Slice Specific Authentication and Authorisation Function (NSSAAF)  supports the following functionality:  • Support for Network Slice-Specific Authentication and Authorisation as  specified in TS 23.502 64with a AAA Server (AAA-S).  AAA-S In the optional-to-use Network slice-specific authentication and authorisation, an  AAA server (AAA-S) may be owned by an external 3rd party enterprise.  AAA-P In the above-mentioned scenario, if the AAA-S belongs to a third party, the  NSSAAF may contact the AAA-S via an AAA proxy. The NSSAA Function and the  AAA-P may be co-located.  EAP-ID Network slice-specific authentication and authorisation uses a User ID and  credentials, different from the 3GPP subscription credentials (e.g. SUPI and  credentials used for PLMN access) and takes place after the primary authentication65.  NFV Security Services Agent  (SSA)  The NFV SSA exists in both the NFVI domain and in VNF domain. NFV SSA in  VNF domain may exist as a separate VSF, or within a VNF. The NFV SSA is  responsible for securely receiving the Security Monitoring policy and implementing  the same.  NFV Security Controller (SC) The NFV SC may interface with other security systems (e.g. Security Analytics),  security databases and other policy engines. The NFV SC orchestrates system wide  security policies. The NFV SC acts as a trusted 3rd party that resides independently.  An NFV SC manages NFV SSAs (like VSFs) to keep them in a consistent state  according to the policy specified. SC also facilitates secure bootstrapping of SSAs  (like VSFs), managing instances of SSAs, secure pairing up with SSA's VNFMs and  EMs, personalize the SSAs, policy management, integrity assertion, credential  management, facilitate clustering of multiple SSAs into a distributed appliance,  monitoring of SSAs for failure and remediation.  NFV Security Services  Provider (SSP)  The NFV SSP is comprised within the VIM and VNFM, and is responsible for  security monitoring policy orchestration received from the Security Controller (NFV  SC) and interacting with the various VIM/VNFM components to implement the  policy across various systems comprising the NFVI/VNF. Furthermore, NFV SSP is  also responsible for receiving the telemetry data from various NFV SSAs, and  optionally making some analysis based on this data.  NFV Security Monitoring  Database  The NFV SecM-DB is a secure database consisting of security data used for  deploying NFV system wide Security Monitoring. This includes Security Monitoring  policy and configurations, security credentials for facilitating secure  communications between the various Security Monitoring components, and  credentials for secure storage of telemetry, including tenant-specific security  policies.  SA/VSF Catalogue Database  (VSF-NVNF-CAT)  The NFV VSF-VNF-CAT is a repository for Security Services Agents like the Virtual  Security Functions (VSF) VNFs. The catalogue has capability to add and remove SSAs  (VSF) packages and/or images, and also includes a VSF VNFD (VNF Descriptor)  containing meta data and information about that VSF VNF. Once the SSA (VSF)  package or instance is added to the catalogue, it becomes available for orchestration.  Audit DB The NFV AUD-DB is a secure database consisting of security audit information.  Security Monitoring Analytics  System  The Security Monitoring Analytics system securely receives Security Monitoring  telemetry from across the NFV systems, including the MANO and all the NFVIs that  may be geographically distributed. The analytics system applies advanced machine  learning techniques on the telemetry to perform advanced detection of security  anomalies and emerging threats in the system. This system also can trigger  remediation actions through the NFV SC.  64 3GPP TS 23.502 V16.5.1 (2020-08) Technical Specification 3rd Generation Partnership Project; Technical Specification  Group Services and System Aspects; Procedures for the 5G System (5GS); Stage 2 (Release 16),  https://www.3gpp.org/ftp/Specs/archive/33_series/33.501/33501-g40.zip, accessed October 2020.  65 3GPP TS 33.501 V16.3.0 (2020-07) Technical Specification 3rd Generation Partnership Project; Technical Specification  Group Services and System Aspects; Security architecture and procedures for 5G system (Release 16),  https://www.3gpp.org/ftp/Specs/archive/33_series/33.501/33501-g40.zip, accessed October 2020.  https://www.3gpp.org/ftp/Specs/archive/33_series/33.501/33501-g40.zip https://www.3gpp.org/ftp/Specs/archive/33_series/33.501/33501-g40.zip  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE FOR 5G NETWORKS  December 2020  54  Element Short description  Subscription Concealed  Identifier (SUCI)  A one-time use subscription identifier, which contains the Scheme-Output, and  additional non-concealed information needed for home network routing and  protection scheme usage.  Subscription Permanent  Identifier (SUPI)  In 5G, all subscribers will be allocated a globally unique 5G SUPI. Example SUPI  formats include the IMSI and NAI (Network Access Identifier)  Authentication Vector A vector consisting of RAND, authentication Token (AUTN) and Hash eXpected  RESponse (HXRES).  Anchor Key The security key KSEAF provided during authentication and used for derivation of  subsequent security keys.  Key Hierarchy Hierarchy of cryptographic key derived from Anchor Key, (as defined in ETSI TS  133 50166 section 6.2.). It includes the following keys: KAUSF, KSEAF, KAMF,  KNASint, KNASenc, KN3IWF, KgNB, KRRCint, KRRCenc, KUPint and KUPenc.  3.10.1 ELEMENTS OF NOVELTY  While many new features in Release 16 contribute to increased security, the relevant addition at  the level of Security Functions is the enhanced support for Network Slice-Specific  Authentication and Authorisation.  The feature allows the use of a User Identifier independent of  existing identifiers relating to a 3GPP subscription or UE, for Network Slice-Specific  Authentication and Authorisation. For such Network Slice Specific Identifiers, the AMF invokes  an EAP-based Network Slice-Specific authentication procedure in which the AUSF exchanges  AAA protocol messages with a potentially external AAA Server (AAA-S) via an optional AAA  Proxy (AAA-P) to authenticate and authorize a UE for the network slice. Depending on the  result of the procedure a UE is either authorized for a network slice, re-allocated to a different  one or deregistered.67.  Other relevant security aspects of enhancing the 5G system include:   Security for enhanced Service Based Architecture   Security for User Plane Gateway Function for Inter-PLMN Security   Security aspects of Enhanced Network Slicing   Security for NR Integrated Access and Backhaul   Security aspects of Service Enabler Architecture Layer for Verticals   Security of evolution of Cellular IoT security for the 5G System   3GPP profiles for cryptographic algorithms and security protocols  Last but not least, Release 16 of 5G specifications include updated versions of the 5G Security  Assurance Specifications (SCAS). SCAS provide an extensive description of the security  requirements (including test cases) to demonstrate compliance of the network product with the  security requirements defined by 3GPP. SCAS are continuously developed to embed solutions  to disclosed vulnerabilities and ensure the security of 5G system’s critical components, and of  the 5G system as a whole.  66 https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_ts/133500_133599/133501/15.01.00_60/ts_133501v150100p.pdf, accessed October  2020  67 3GPP TR 21.916 V0.5.0 (2020-07) Technical Report 3rd Generation Partnership Project; Technical Specification Group  Services and System Aspects; Release 16 Description; Summary of Rel-16 Work Items (Release 16),  https://www.3gpp.org/ftp/Specs/archive/33_series/33.501/33501-g40.zip, accessed October 2020.  https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_ts/133500_133599/133501/15.01.00_60/ts_133501v150100p.pdf https://www.3gpp.org/ftp/Specs/archive/33_series/33.501/33501-g40.zip  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE FOR 5G NETWORKS  December 2020  55  The following SCAS requirements have been updated to reflect changes proposed by Release 16:  TS 33.512 - Access and Mobility management Function (AMF)  TS 33.514 - Unified Data Management (UDM)  TS 33.515 - Session Management Function (SMF)  TS 33.516 - Authentication Server Function (AUSF)  TS 33.517 - Security Edge Protection Proxy (SEPP)  TS 33.520 - Non-3GPP Inter-Working Function (N3IWF)  3.10.2 SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS  No security considerations have been developed for this zoom-in. This is due to the fact that all  security consideration covered in the rest of the zoom-ins constitute the entire set of security  considerations, underlying thus its horizontal nature of security. Hence, it is considered that they  cover this topic in an exhaustive manner and there is no need to be repeated in this section.  3.11 5G PHYSICAL INFRASTRUCTURE (ZOOM-IN)  One of the most relevant aspects in the transition from previous generations of mobile  telecommunications into 5G is the fact that part of the network functions, previously performed  by physical appliances, are now executed by software that virtualizes the functionality of  physical components. Additionally, some of these physical components were mostly proprietary  and incompatible with other solutions but with 5G, the network software can run in any  commercial-of-the-shelf (COTS) hardware, allowing the operators to have more independence  from manufacturers and share physical infrastructures among various tenants and applications.  This significant change will allow great scalability, quicker deployments, cost efficiency and  integration between different components of the network. On the other hand, the virtualisation of  physical infrastructure components increases significantly the impact of failures: a shared  physical component will serve multiple functions (e.g. virtual functions, slicing, user equipment  functions, etc.), playing thus a significant role in the service provisioning chain.  Nonetheless, the physical 5G architecture is going to remain exposed to more generic threats  that are pertinent to physical components, such as damage/theft, sabotage, natural disasters,  outages, failures and malfunctions, just to name the most important ones. While in previous  mobile networks such failures had a more “restricted” influence in service provisioning, with the  5G virtualisation failures of physical components may have an amplified impact, typical to  shared resources. This fact increases the criticality of 5G physical infrastructure components,  as multiple services are going to depend on them. The 5G physical infrastructure is depicted in  the following the figure.  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE FOR 5G NETWORKS  December 2020  56  Figure 10: 5G physical infrastructure Zoom-in  3.11.1 ELEMENTS OF NOVELTY  While 5G Release 16 does not bring any novelties to the physical infrastructure per se, a series  of enhancements referred to in other sections of the document will impact the physical  infrastructure and associated security considerations:   Integrated Access and Backhaul, eliminates the need for wired backhaul connection,  allowing a speedier densification of the wireless network.   Improved support for non-public networks (NPN) will lead to an increase in deployment  scenarios that involve private networks that utilize dedicated small cell base stations)  that are independently managed to deliver locally-optimized applications. Further detail  is given in section the 5G RAN zoom-in (see section Error! Reference source not f  ound.).  3.11.2 SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS  Impact of virtualisation  Software Defined Networking (SDN) and Network Function Virtualization (NFV) allow  disconnection of software execution from specific physical hardware and provide for better  resilience and latency. SDN offers flexibility how to configure the routing paths between  dynamically configured virtualized network functions.  It should be noted, that container technology generates a bigger attack surface against systems  (e.g. via supported APIs, and through intrinsically less security functions, by being a technology  at initial maturity levels). However, softwarisation and virtualization of functions may increase  availability and integrity requirements for shared physical resources, some of them placed in  remote locations. Physical security controls for such resources should be commensurate with  their respective importance.  Affected components: Central DC, Local DC  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE FOR 5G NETWORKS  December 2020  57  General Physical security considerations  Physical security considerations valid for previous generations of mobile networks still apply.  They focus around two general objectives: ensuring appropriate environmental conditions for  equipment operations and protection of perimeters hosting sensitive assets.  Special consideration must be given to equipment located in third party premises or otherwise  remote facilities rooms. These should be protected using a risk-calibrated set of physical and  environmental controls aimed to assure access control, monitoring, continuity of operations and  protection against environmental disasters. Failure to do so may lead to unauthorised access,  destruction of assets and impairment of operations.  Related components: Local DC, gNB-DU, gNB-CU  Threats to edge cloud computing resources  The deployment of Edge Cloud computing resources at the edge of the network, in data centres  or data rooms with significantly less physical control and protection than the central data  centres expose important computing resources to physical security threats, which can lead to  service compromise or even an access path to central resources.  Affected components: Edge DC  Vulnerability of air interface to jamming attacks  As any wireless cellular networks, 5G networks are built upon open sharing over specific  frequencies, making them prone to interference. This weakness can be used by some  adversary nodes/equipment to cause intentional interference and hinder legitimate user’s  communication over the spectrum of wireless channels dedicated to this technology. 5G  improves resilience against jamming attacks over the 4G LTE, but remains vulnerable to  customised attacks68. Jamming attacks are a particular concern for mission-critical applications.  Related components: Base stations  3.12 IMPLEMENTATION OPTIONS / MIGRATION PATHS ZOOM IN  5G can be deployed in different deployment options, where SA (standalone) options consist of  only one generation of radio access technology and NSA options consist of two generations of  radio access technologies (4G LTE and 5G). The early deployments will be adopting either non-  standalone option 3 or standalone option 2 as the standardisation of these two options have  already been completed69.  Non-standalone option 3 is where radio access network is composed of eNBs (eNode Bs) as  the master node and gNBs (gNode Bs) as the secondary node. The radio access network is  connected to EPC (Evolved Packet Core). The NSA option 3, as it leverages existing 4G  deployment, can be brought to market quickly with minor modification to the 4G network. This  option also supports legacy 4G devices and the 5G devices only need to support NR (New  Radio) protocols so device can also be developed quickly.  On the other hand, NSA option 3 does not introduce 5GC and therefore may not be optimised  for new 5G use cases beyond mobile broadband. In addition, depending on how 5G devices are  68 Y.

Faruque, \"Smart Jamming Attacks in 5G New Radio: A Review,\" 2020 10th Annual Computing and  Communication Workshop and Conference (CCWC), Las Vegas, NV, USA, 2020, pp. 1010-1015, doi:  10.1109/CCWC47524.2020.9031175, accessed October 2020.  69 GSMA - 5G Implementation Guidelines: NSA Option 3, February 2020  https://www.gsma.com/futurenetworks/wp- content/uploads/2019/03/5G-Implementation-Guidelines-NSA-Option-3-v2.1.pdf, accessed October 2020.  https://www.gsma.com/futurenetworks/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/5G-Implementation-Guidelines-NSA-Option-3-v2.1.pdf https://www.gsma.com/futurenetworks/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/5G-Implementation-Guidelines-NSA-Option-3-v2.1.pdf  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE FOR 5G NETWORKS  December 2020  58  developed, the EPC may need to be retained longer than in the case of having EPS (Evolved  Packet System) for 4G alone (instead of supporting NSA Option 3).  Standalone option 2 is where radio access network consists of only gNBs (gNode Bs) and  connects to 5GC (5G Core), and the 5GC interworks with EPC. SA option 2 has no impact on  LTE radio and can fully support all 5G use cases by enabling network slicing via cloud native  service-based architecture. On the other hand, this option requires both NR and 5GC, making  time-to-market slower and deployment cost higher than that of NSA option 3. Furthermore, the  devices would need to support NR and core network protocols so it would take more time to  develop devices.  Finally, as the standalone 5G System would need to interwork with EPS to ensure service  continuity depending on coverage, the interworking between EPC and 5GC may be necessary.  Figure 11: Implementation options / Migration Paths  The elements of the Option 3 Non-standalone architecture are:  Element  Short description  EPC Evolved Packet Core (EPC) is a framework for providing converged voice and data on a  4G Long-Term Evolution (LTE) network.  2G and 3G network architectures process and switch voice and data through two separate  sub-domains: circuit-switched (CS) for voice and packet-switched (PS) for data. Evolved  Packet Core unifies voice and data on an Internet Protocol (IP) service architecture and  voice is treated as just another IP application.  EPC+ Evolved Packet Core (EPC) is the LTE Core Network.  In order to support the Non-standalone deployments with LTE and NR technologies, the  core network will need to undergo a series of improvements – hence the EPC+  designation. Envisaged improvements include increasing the bandwidth of the S1-U  interface to meet the LTE/NSA transmission requirements.  There are two typical scenarios for EPC upgrade to support 5G deployment.  Scenario A:  • Physical EPC is upgraded to support NSA;  • Capacity expansion is based on physical EPC.  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE FOR 5G NETWORKS  December 2020  59  Element  Short description  Scenario B:  • Build a new virtualized EPC network to support NSA independently;  • Interoperability is made between the new virtualized EPC and the physical EPC;  • Capacity expansion is based on the virtualized EPC.  At the time of this analysis, priority is given to Scenario B, which can be smoothly evolved  to the target network through the expansion of virtualized EPC.  5G Core Network (5GC) The core network is the central part of the 5G infrastructure and enables all functions  related to multi-access technologies - see 5G Core Network zoom-in.  En-gNB En-gNB is a node providing NR user plane and control plane protocol terminations  towards the UE, and acting as Secondary Node in EN-DC.  En-gNB is a gNB that supports legacy E-UTRAN interface.  MeNB (Master node) The LTE eNB is referred to as the MeNB to indicate that it is the ‘Master’ (M) base station  controlling the ‘Secondary’ (S) 5G NR base station.  In MR-DC (Multi-Radio Dual Connectivity), the radio access node that provides the control  plane connection to the core network. It may be a Master eNB (in EN-DC), a Master ng- eNB (in NGEN-DC) or a Master gNB (in NR-DC and NE-DC).  X2 Interface X2 is an interface for the interconnection of two E-UTRAN NodeB (eNB) components and  an E-UTRAN NodeB (eNB) and an E-UTRAN gNodeB (en-gNB) within the Evolved  Universal Terrestrial Radio Access Network (E-UTRAN) architecture. It is specified in the  3GPP 36.42x series of technical specifications.  The X2 interface provides capability to support radio interface mobility and Dual  Connectivity either between eNBs or between eNBs and en-gNBs of UEs having a  connection with E-UTRAN.  The list of functions on the X2 interface is the following:  • Intra LTE-Access-System Mobility Support for ECM-CONNECTED UE;  • Load Management;  • Inter-cell Interference Coordination;  • General X2 management and error handling functions;  • Application level data exchange between eNBs  • Trace functions;  • Data exchange for self-optimisation;  • E-UTRA-NR Dual Connectivity (EN-DC).  S1 Interface S1 interface for the interconnection of the evolved NodeB (eNB) component of the  Evolved Universal Terrestrial Radio Access Network (E-UTRAN) to the Core Network  (CN) of the Evolved Packet System (EPS). It is specified in the 3GPP 36.41x series of  technical specifications.  The S1 interface supports:  • procedures to establish, maintain and release E-UTRAN Radio Access Bearers;  • procedures to perform intra-LTE handover and inter-RAT handover;  • the separation of each UE on the protocol level for user specific signalling  management;  • the transfer of NAS signalling messages between UE and EPC;  • location services by transferring requests from the EPC to E-UTRAN, and  location information from E-UTRAN to EPC;  • mechanisms for resource reservation for packet data streams.  MME Mobility Management Entity (MME) is the key control-node for the LTE access-network. It  is responsible for idle mode User Equipment (UE) paging and tagging procedure including  retransmissions. It is involved in the bearer activation/deactivation process and is also  responsible for choosing the Serving Gateway for a UE at the initial attach and at time of  intra-LTE handover involving Core Network (CN) node relocation. It is responsible for  authenticating the user (by interacting with the Home Subscriber Server). The Non Access  Stratum (NAS) signalling terminates at the MME and it is also responsible for generation  and allocation of temporary identities to UEs. It checks the authorisation of the UE to  camp on the service provider's Public Land Mobile Network (PLMN) and enforces UE  roaming restrictions.  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE FOR 5G NETWORKS  December 2020  60  Element  Short description  SGW The Serving Gateway (SGW) routes and forwards user data packets, while also acting as  the mobility anchor for the user plane during inter-eNodeB handovers and as the anchor  for mobility between LTE and other 3GPP technologies (terminating S4 interface and  relaying the traffic between 2G/3G systems and Packet Data Network Gateway). For idle  state User Equipment, the Serving Gateway terminates the downlink data path and  triggers paging when downlink data arrives for the User Equipment. It manages and  stores UE contexts, e.g. parameters of the IP bearer service, network internal routing  information.  User Equipment (UE) User equipment is any device used by users to communicate within the 5G infrastructure.  Besides a SIM, user equipment may be home appliances of any kind (e.g. computer, IoT  devices, etc.).  3.12.1 SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS  Risks related to legacy technologies  LTE networks and 5G NSA networks based on LTE core networks will continue to operate in  the operators’ networks for years to come. Early 5G commercial launches are leveraging  3GPP’s Non-Standalone 5G specifications, meaning these early 5G NSA networks are required  to use the LTE control plane protocols and the LTE Evolved Packet Core (EPC) network. Initial  5G NSA launches will deliver only Enhanced Mobile Broadband (eMBB) service so, any LTE  threats and vulnerabilities will also exist in the 5G NSA network.  Even after the operators upgrade their cell sites with 5G radios (gNBs) using the NSA  architecture, some of these 5G NSA cell sites may operate as 5G NSA sites for years after  Standalone 5G networks are operational. NSA architectures are expected to live alongside  each other for a considerable period, so a series of legacy risks will remain active70.  Affected components: EPC, eNB  INTER-RAT (Radio Access Technologies) Handover  3GPP has specified interworking that allows 5GC network functions to support interfaces to an  EPC. Handover attempts to NR connected to 5GC from 4G LTE will occur, with active data  sessions at risk of disruption if a roaming agreement exists for 4G, but not for 5G between  PLMN’s. The MME can prevent such handover attempts by including RAT and Core Network  Type restrictions in the Handover Restriction List to E-UTRAN71.  Roaming  5G NSA roaming is essentially 4G roaming because NSA uses the EPC for all Core Network  functions. From a security perspective, a 5G NSA roaming connection introduces no new  protection, since it continues to use Diameter, SIP/VoLTE and possibly SS7. Diameter and SS7  are vulnerable to eavesdropping including voice calls, reading text messages, and tracking  phones. Note: This consideration is also relevant for 5G SA, as there will be a need for roaming  agreements with non-5G networks, hence Diameter and SS7 attacks will still apply.  70 A 5G AMERICAS White Paper – Security considerations for the 5G Era, June2020 https://www.5gamericas.org/wp- content/uploads/2020/07/Security-Considerations-for-the-5G-Era-FINAL-Word.docx, accessed October 2020  71 GSMA - 5G Roaming Guidelines, May 2020  https://www.gsma.com/newsroom/wp-content/uploads//NG.113-v2.0-1.pdf ,  accessed October 2020.  https://www.5gamericas.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Security-Considerations-for-the-5G-Era-FINAL-Word.docx https://www.5gamericas.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Security-Considerations-for-the-5G-Era-FINAL-Word.docx https://www.gsma.com/newsroom/wp-content/uploads/NG.113-v2.0-1.pdf  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE FOR 5G NETWORKS  December 2020  61  For 5G SA the roaming flows will be considerably different, as HTTP/2 and JavaScript Object  Notation (JSON) will be used versus the legacy Diameter protocol. Voice over New Radio  (VoNR) will replace VoLTE in the 5G network and Security Edge Protection Proxy (SEPP) will  establish a secure, encrypted connection with the roaming partner’s SEPP72.  As regards inter-operators Roaming, the following considerations need to be taken into account:  - Authentication confirmation between 5G SA-Networks must be activated in order to  address the voice&sms eavesdropping, as well as the tracking threats. But whether or  not authentication confirmation will be activated/enforced depends on multiple  parameters.  - According to 33.501, SUPI “should” be encrypted while ME attaches in roaming scenario,  but there are exceptions to this rule, which may become the norm if care is not taken.  Affected components: EPC, eNB.  Note: In roaming, components and procedures not specified by 3GPP play a role, for example  those involved with CDR (Calling Data Record) exchange, such as NRTRDE (Near Real Time  Roaming Data Exchange), SS7 Firewalls and SMS Firewalls.  Failure to meet General Security Assurance Requirements  The security assured by the EPC / 5G Core functions and the security of the Core Network itself  is built upon the permanent update of Security Assurance Requirements for critical network  components.  Failure the ensure that early-deployed systems or sub-systems comply with updated security  assurance requirements may lead to unsubstantiated trust in the security offered by the 5G  system as a whole.  3.13 PROCESS MAP  Telecommunication network security is more than a sum of technical specifications. Security is  built and maintained by security-relevant processes, in four major areas:  - Standardization: operators, vendors and other stake-holders set standards for how  networks around the globe will work together. This also includes how best to protect  networks and users against malicious actors.  - Network design: vendors design, develop and implement the agreed standards for  functional network elements and systems only, and warrant that they have a complete  control and responsibility over the whole delivered systems, which play a crucial part in  making the end network product both functional and secure.  - Network configuration: at the deployment phase, networks are configured for a  targeted security level, which is key to setting security parameters and further  strengthening the security and resilience of the network.  - Network deployment and operation: the operational processes which allow networks to  function and deliver targeted levels of security are highly dependent on the deployment  and operations of the network itself.73  While all stakeholders are relevant to ensure that security is embedded in the 5G System,  design, implementation and operation, two stakeholders are of particular relevance to the  72 A 5G AMERICAS White Paper – Security considerations for the 5G Era, June2020 https://www.5gamericas.org/wp- content/uploads/2020/07/Security-Considerations-for-the-5G-Era-FINAL-Word.docx, accessed October 2020.  73 A guide to 5G network securityericsson.com; Conceptualizing security in mobile communication networks – how does 5G  fit in?: Ericsson AB 2018; https://www.ericsson.com/48fcab/assets/local/news/2018/10201291- 04_gir_report_broschure_dec2018_webb_181212.pdf, accessed October 2020.  https://www.5gamericas.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Security-Considerations-for-the-5G-Era-FINAL-Word.docx https://www.5gamericas.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Security-Considerations-for-the-5G-Era-FINAL-Word.docx https://www.ericsson.com/48fcab/assets/local/news/2018/10201291-04_gir_report_broschure_dec2018_webb_181212.pdf https://www.ericsson.com/48fcab/assets/local/news/2018/10201291-04_gir_report_broschure_dec2018_webb_181212.pdf  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE FOR 5G NETWORKS  December 2020  62  cybersecurity of 5G network. On the one hand, mobile network operators (MNO) have a central,  decision-making role, giving them leverage on the overall secure operation of their networks,  and on the other hand, telecom equipment manufacturers, who are responsible for the provision  of software and hardware required to operate networks and liable for any Trojan or uncontrolled  piece of software delivered to MNO74.  To reflect this, in this section we highlight MNO and Vendor lifecycle processes and the  associated security considerations, along with Security Assurance processes that span across  several relevant stakeholder groups.  3.13.1 MNO Lifecycle Processes  MNO Lifecycle processes are aligned with eTOM – enhanced Telecom Operation Map75, and  include all actions necessary to Design, Build and Operate the 5G Network. eTOM  makes  available  a  standard  structure,  terminology  and  classification  scheme  for  describing  business processes and their constituent building blocks.76  Of increased importance for the Secure Design, Implementation and Operation of the 5G  System are the Resource and Supply Chain Development, Management and Operation  Processes, as well as the Enterprise Risk management Processes.  An overview of the MNO processes most critical to 5G system’s security over the Design, Build,  Operate phases is presented in the figure below:  Figure 12: MNO Lifecycle processes  74 EU coordinated risk assessment of the cybersecurity of 5G networks Report 9 October2019,  https://ec.europa.eu/newsroom/dae/document.cfm?doc_id=62132, accessed October 2020.  75 http://casewise.tmforum.org/evolve/statics/frameworx/#cwtype=index&cwview=index_diagrams_etom_start, accessed  November 2020.  76 M.3050 : Enhanced Telecom Operations Map (eTOM) – An eTOM primer, https://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-M.3050-200702- I!Sup4/en, accessed November 2020  https://ec.europa.eu/newsroom/dae/document.cfm?doc_id=62132 https://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-M.3050-200702-I!Sup4/en https://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-M.3050-200702-I!Sup4/en  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE FOR 5G NETWORKS  December 2020  63  The description of MNO lifecycle processes in correlation with eTOM – enhanced Telecom  Operation Map77 is presented below:  Process Short description of the process  Resource capability delivery This category of processes coordinate and enact deployment of new technologies.  These processes ensure that network and associated resources are deployed in  timely and compliant manner.  This is why well-functioning of these processes is critical to coordinate major system  changes such as transition to 5G  Resource development and  retirement  This category of processes encompasses all processes in the Build phase charged  with development of new technologies and the associated resource types. These  processes are also tasked with the initial decision to acquire external resources,  therefore due needs to be taken to provide necessary controls that take into account  all relevant risks. Last but not least, retirement or removal of certain technologies  and associated resource types, are relevant in the context of transition to new  technologies such as 5G.  Support Resource  management and operation  - Support & Readiness  Support & Readiness processes are to ensure that appropriate resources are  available and ready to support the Operation Phase processes.  Key responsibilities of these processes that directly impact security of the 5G  System include: operations readiness testing and acceptance, Vulnerability  Management, Threat Assessments, Risk Assessment and Mitigation and Secure  Configuration Activities  Resource provisioning Resource Provisioning process deal with allocation, installation, configuration,  activation and testing of resources.  Key responsibilities of these processes that directly impact security of the 5G  System include: verification of resource availability; allocation of resources to  requests from other processes such as incident recovery, vulnerability management  or security function capability; configuration management, and; activation of  resources and updating of resource inventory.  Resource Trouble  Management  Resource Trouble Management processes are tasked with the management of  undesired behaviour of specific resources, hence they are key for timely and  effective management of security events. .  Resource data collection &  distribution  Resource Data Collection & Distribution category of processes encompasses  technical monitoring of resource and service instances and monitoring of enterprise  processes to support to resource and service instances.  Results of monitoring processes provide key input for other processes such as  configuration management, performance management, security management.  Resource Performance  Management  Resource Performance Management processes use information received from  monitoring processes to analyse, control and report on the performance of specific  resources, in order to maintain operational objectives such as service quality and  security. Performance management processes should interface with other process  classes such as Resource Trouble Management, Service Quality Management or  Security Management.  Party Tender Management Party Tender Management processes manage the entire tender lifecycle, from  development of tender documents to tender decision-making.  These processes are key for 5GS compliance and security, as due care should be  taken to include all relevant requirements in tender documents and ensure  adequateness of suppliers to risk classes of purchased products or services..  Party Offering Development  & Retirement  Party Offering Development & Retirement manage the on-boarding and off-boarding  of product specifications and thus are critical to ensure an adequate level of security  at component and system level.  77 http://casewise.tmforum.org/evolve/statics/frameworx/#cwtype=index&cwview=index_frameworx_processes, accessed  November 2020.  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE FOR 5G NETWORKS  December 2020  64  Process Short description of the process  Party Agreement  Management  Party Agreement Management manages all aspects of agreements with suppliers  and partners, from initiation to completion, to enable delivery of business and  technical capabilities required by the 5G system.  Party Support Management processes to engage parties who own and manage infrastructure,  provide infrastructure capabilities, or otherwise provide value to the operator.  Necessary facilities need to be in place to provide for interaction with parties in  delivering products and/or services necessary for the operation of the 5G system.  Party Interaction  Management  Interaction management deals with logging partners/supplier interaction, notification  of interacting parties and matters such as communication channels and  authentication/authorisation. These processes are key to ensure service level and  security at all phases of the 5GS, but also an important element in preventing  unauthorised dissemination of sensitive data.  Party Problem Handling Tasked with timely and effective resolution of all problems related to the  supplier/partner. It includes the entire problem lifecycle, from problem  communication, management, to closure and reporting  Party Performance  Management  Along with resource performance management, this process provides key input to  manage performance of key activities and resources outsourced to external  providers.  Business Continuity  Management  Development of strategies, policies, plans, organizational roles, responsibilities and  procedures for ensuring continuation of business processes and activities in the  event of serious and/or sustained interruption.  The relevant component of BCM for the 5G system are:   Infrastructure recovery planning which provides for recovery and backup  procedures for all key infrastructure capabilities;   Serious incident management planning which defines the operational  procedures and escalation criteria for operational and security incidents.  Note: BCM practices might encompass ITIL Service continuity management.  Fraud Management The general objective of the Fraud Management is prevention, detection and  response to fraud risk, fraudulent activities and actors.  The relevance of Fraud management processes for this document is given by the  fact that they encompass interaction with Law Enforcement Agencies (LEA).  Enterprise risk audit  management  Enterprise Risk Audit Management proactively works with the business to  understand, assess, and report on risk. This category of processes provide  assurance to senior management that the processes and controls to mitigate risk are  effective and conform to reference standards. This process is relevant as the  migration to 5G will expose the MNO to novel risks which must be correctly  identified, evaluated and managed  Insurance management Insurance management processes identify areas and activities within the enterprise  where risk aspects are insurable and analyse the cost/benefits of undertaking  specific insurance. This process is relevant as the migration to 5G will expose the  MNO to novel risks, or may impact the operator’s exposure to currently insured risks.  Regulatory management Regulatory Management processes ensure that the enterprise complies with all  applicable regulations. This might be sector-specific (telecommunications), or  general, e.g. NIS Directive and subsequent national legislation. The relevant  requirements must be fed in to the design and operation processes  Security Management Security management processes as per ISO 27011 / ITU X.1051, including Incident  Management.  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE FOR 5G NETWORKS  December 2020  65  3.13.2 VENDOR DEVELOPMENT AND PRODUCT LIFE CYCLE PROCESSES  Vendor Development and Product Lifecycle processes covers all aspects potentially impacting  a Network Product’s lifetime, including it being planned, designed, implemented, delivered,  updated, and eventually ramped down.  For new Network Products and any modifications of Network Products, the Product  Development phases are executed in a cyclical fashion, starting again from the beginning once  finished for the previous Network Product release78.  These processes must meet a clear set of security objectives and requirements to ensure that  network products meet the baseline security criteria and capabilities necessary as building  blocks for the overall security of the 5G network.  In addition, the network products themselves must meet baseline security criteria, tailored to  their product class. These criteria are defined by 3GPP in the Security Assurance Specifications  (SCASs) series of Technical Specification. Specific use cases and deployment scenarios may  request additional security requirements, as defined by operators or regulators.  An objective assessment process that the network products and the processes at their origin  meet baseline criteria is paramount for building trust in the 5G network, hence an important  input for any procurement decisions.  The GSMA Network Equipment Security Assurance Scheme (NESAS)79 and 3GPP Security  Assurance Methodology (SECAM)80 provide the blueprint for such an evaluation process and  reference criteria. While the allocation of responsibilities among the actors of an assurance  scheme might vary, the activities and their flow should be always based on the principles of  independence, objectivity, competence. The vendor and product lifecycle processes are  presented below:  Figure 13: Vendor and product lifecycle processes  78 FS.16 – NESAS Development and Lifecycle Security Requirements v.1.1, GSMA, 20 July 2020,  https://www.gsma.com/security/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/FS.16-NESAS-Development-and-Lifecycle-Security- Requirements-v1.1.pdf, accessed October 2020.  79 FS.16 – NESAS Development and Lifecycle Security Requirements v.1.1, GSMA, 20 July 2020,  https://www.gsma.com/security/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/FS.16-NESAS-Development-and-Lifecycle-Security- Requirements-v1.1.pdf, accessed October 2020.  80 3GPP TR 33.818 V0.7.0 (2020-05), Technical Report, 3rd Generation Partnership Project; Technical Specification Group  Services and System Aspects; Security Assurance Methodology (SECAM); and Security Assurance Specification (SCAS);  for 3GPP virtualized network products (Release 16), https://www.3gpp.org/ftp/Specs/archive/33_series/33.501/33501- g40.zip, accessed October 2020.  https://www.gsma.com/security/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/FS.16-NESAS-Development-and-Lifecycle-Security-Requirements-v1.1.pdf https://www.gsma.com/security/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/FS.16-NESAS-Development-and-Lifecycle-Security-Requirements-v1.1.pdf https://www.gsma.com/security/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/FS.16-NESAS-Development-and-Lifecycle-Security-Requirements-v1.1.pdf https://www.gsma.com/security/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/FS.16-NESAS-Development-and-Lifecycle-Security-Requirements-v1.1.pdf https://www.3gpp.org/ftp/Specs/archive/33_series/33.501/33501-g40.zip https://www.3gpp.org/ftp/Specs/archive/33_series/33.501/33501-g40.zip  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE FOR 5G NETWORKS  December 2020  66  The description of the Vendor and product lifecycle processes is presented below.  Process Sub-processes  Planning In case of a completely new Network Product, the requirements for the first Release  are planned. In the case of a new version of an existing Network Product, the  requirements for the changes to be introduced by the next release are planned based  on updated functional requirements as well as bug and vulnerability reports received  against prior versions, if applicable.  Design The implementation of the planned requirements for the Release is planned in detail.  Implementation  The planned requirements are implemented as per the design.  Testing and Verification The fulfilment of the requirements by the implementation is verified. If the verification  fails, the relevant requirement usually goes back to the “Implementation” phase. This  phase also contains the security related testing and verification activities.  Release The decision to release a given revision of a tested and verified implementation.  Manufacturing In this phase, the development Release is converted into a deliverable Network  Product. In the case of pure software delivery, this is the delivery of the Release to the  provisioning process.  Delivery The delivery of the manufactured Network Product.  Product development  process  All the phases described above.  First Commercial  Introduction  The Network Product starts its commercial lifetime by means of a first Release to be  accepted for use in live commercial networks. Before that, earlier Releases may have  been tested in test environments.  Update The Network Product is updated by means of either a minor or a major Release. This  phase is usually a cycle of such Releases.  Minor Release  A minor Release fixes vulnerabilities and other bugs found in earlier versions. It  commonly introduces not more than minor feature enhancements and architectural  changes.  Major Release A major Release fixes vulnerabilities and other bugs found in earlier versions. It may  introduce major feature enhancements and architectural changes.  End Of Life No updates for the Network Product are supplied anymore. As this process occurs  after contractual and regulatory requirements to maintain the Network Product have  ceased, this commonly marks the end of a Network Product’s lifetime.  3.13.3 SECURITY ASSURANCE PROCESSES  The operator can use as support for its purchasing decision the results of security conformity  assessments integral to the Security Assurance Methodology, as defined by 3GPP33.916  Technical Specification81.  The SECAM process provides the blueprint for any security assurance scheme such as product  certification and vendor accreditation, and covers the following tasks:  81 3GPP TR 33.916 V16.0.0(2020-07) Technical Report 3rd Generation Partnership Project; Technical Specification Group  Services and System Aspects; Security Assurance Methodology (SCAS) for 3GPP network products (Release 16),  https://www.3gpp.org/ftp/Specs/archive/33_series/33.501/33501-g40.zip, accessed October 2020.  https://www.3gpp.org/ftp/Specs/archive/33_series/33.501/33501-g40.zip  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE FOR 5G NETWORKS  December 2020  67   Vendor network product development and network product lifecycle management  process assurance compliance (assessing if the method used to develop the products  is compliant with the Vendor network product development and network product  lifecycle management process assurance requirements).   Security Compliance Testing (assessing if requested security requirements are  correctly implemented in a network product). This includes Vulnerability Testing  (running of a set of FOSS/COTS tools on external interfaces of the Network product).  The ultimate output of the SECAM evaluation is:   An evaluation report demonstrating compliance of the network product with the 3GPP  security assurance specifications;   Evidence to demonstrate to the test laboratory that the accredited vendor product and  development lifecycle processes have been complied with for the network product;   Evidence that the actors performing the evaluation tasks are accredited by the SECAM  Accreditation Body.  The operator examines the evaluation reports together with the evidence that the actors  performing the evaluation tasks have been accredited by the SECAM Accreditation Body.  Note: while the actors and distribution of tasks and responsibilities among actors may vary in  different Assurance schemes, the general processes and sequence of tasks will stay generally  unchanged, provided that criteria for impartiality and competence of actors that perform  assessment tasks are maintained. The security assurance activities are presented below.  Figure 14: Security assurance activities  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE FOR 5G NETWORKS  December 2020  68  The description of the security assurance activities is presented below.  Activity Description  Accreditation Formal recognition by an accreditation body that a conformity assessment body is  impartial and competent to carry out specific tests or types of assessments.  The Accreditation Body defines requirements and processes for:   vendor network product development and network product lifecycle  management processes accreditation;   test laboratory (vendor owned or third party) accreditation, and   dispute resolution.  Product development  process  Vendor network product development and network product lifecycle management  processes assurance requirements as well as related evaluation activities generic to all  network product classes are defined by the Accreditation Body. In the SECAM scheme,  the requirements are defined in the NESAS Security Assurance Requirements, but  various conformity assessment schemes may define different criteria.  Lifecycle management consists of establishing discipline and control in the updates of  network product during its development and maintenance. Lifecycle management  controls are important during normal improvement of network product as well as for  vulnerability/security flaw remediation (documentation used to track vulnerability/security  flaw, remediation procedure with relation to corrective actions for each identified  vulnerability/security flaw…).  The Vendor network product development and network product lifecycle management  processes assessment covers a vendor's engineering processes and does not  necessarily apply only to a single network product. This means that the results of one  assessment may apply to more than one network product. Vendors can submit their  generic network product development and network product lifecycle management  processes or a subset of them for auditing and accreditation.  Security compliance testing Evaluation process step used to describe activities for checking the compliance of a  network product with applicable Security Assurance Specifications (SCAS).  Vulnerability testing The process of running security tools against a network product.  Vulnerability testing is defined by the use of Free and Open Source Software (FOSS)  and Commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) security testing tools on the external interfaces of  the network product, as well as manual testing procedures for specific attack scenarios.  Operator procurement  decision  The operator examines the network product, the security compliance testing, including  the vulnerability testing analysis reports, the self-declaration as well as the optional  evidence of accreditation from the SECAM Accreditation Body for the actors performing  the evaluation task and decides if the results are sufficient according to its internal  policies. In particular, the operator can perform a sample of the security compliance  testing and vulnerability testing, based on the delivered test procedures.  Audit During an audit, the processes will be evaluated and their application on development  activities in practice will be verified. An accreditation will be awarded, if the requirements  are met.  The accreditation processes consist of:   assessing the skills of the vendor‘s or third-party test laboratories in conducting  an evaluation for conformance to Security Assurance requirements for a given  network product class or range of classes, and   assessing the compliance to Test methodology (for security compliance testing  and vulnerability testing laboratories).  Monitoring The Accreditation Body monitors different kinds of accredited actors within the scheme:   Vendors development and product lifecycle processes, which are expected to  comply with the Security Assurance requirements and   Test laboratories (for security compliance testing and vulnerability testing),  which are expected to comply with the Test Methodology and skills  requirements.  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE FOR 5G NETWORKS  December 2020  69  Activity Description  Standardisation 5G security issues are addressed in the work undertaken by standards bodies, notably  within the workgroup on Service and System Aspects 3 (SA3) of the 3rd Generation  Partnership Project (3GPP). Other relevant standardisation bodies include ETSI and  GSMA.  Development of standards continuously evolve security specifications, taking into  account ongoing research on security threats and vulnerabilities.  Responsible disclosure Vulnerability Disclosure of security vulnerabilities is a well-established process which  allows stakeholders such as security researchers to report details of security  vulnerabilities in products and services.  Vulnerability Disclosure Programmes, such as the GSMA Coordinated Vulnerability  Disclosure (CVD) programme provide a framework that sets clear expectations for  constructive engagement by all parties to remediate or mitigate notified vulnerabilities.82  Results of vulnerability disclosure processes are an important input for standardization  work, as security requirements are evolving to respond to identified vulnerabilities.  82 GSM Association FS.23-GSMA Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure Program, Version 3.016 July 2020,  https://www.gsma.com/security/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/FS.23-v3.0.pdf , accessed September 2020  https://www.gsma.com/security/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/FS.23-v3.0.pdf  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE FOR 5G NETWORKS  December 2020  70  4. 5G VULNERABILITIES  4.1 VULNERABILITY ASSESSMENT METHOD AND SCOPE  This chapter provides the vulnerability assessment for the components of the 5G architecture.  The chapter is structured according to the various zoom-ins: for each zoom-in, a set of  vulnerabilities for all related components is being presented. These vulnerabilities detail the  security considerations formulated for each zoom-in.  Due to the large number of vulnerabilities, and in order to facilitate readability, in this chapter we  introduce vulnerability groups for the components of each zoom-in. The detailed vulnerabilities  of each zoom-in are presented in a corresponding annex. While in the following sections a short  description of vulnerability groups with highlights of the assessed weaknesses are presented,  the annexes provide all details of each individual vulnerability, such as: detailed description,  associated assets, threats exploiting the vulnerability, security controls to remove/reduce the  exploitation surface, stakeholder responsible for the implementation of controls, as well as  references to relevant sources.  For the sake of completeness of vulnerability assessment, some vulnerability groups that apply  to multiple assets throughout several zoom-ins, are repeated in all relevant zoom-ins. This  redundancy has been introduced in order to have a complete picture of the vulnerabilities at  zoom-in level. Examples of such vulnerabilities are: virtualization vulnerabilities, vulnerabilities  emerging from weak hardening of software, logging vulnerabilities, etc.  Each of the following sections is dedicate to a zoom-in. Besides the vulnerability groups  applying to the assets of the zoom-in, it provides a reference to the cyberthreats that may lead  to an exploitation, to the relevant measure foreseen in the Toolbox, as well as to references in  relevant literature.  As regards the target groups of vulnerability assessment, the vulnerability groups presented in  this chapter targets technical experts willing to have an overview of weaknesses of various  technical components included in a zoom-in. This information can be used as a check-list in  order to scrutinize the development of technical and organisation security measures and/or  assess future actions to assess the priorities in the implementation of measures (e.g. depending  on the current status of implementation of 5G functions).  The detailed vulnerabilities found in the annexes target technical experts working in the  implementation of threat mitigation.

Security update gap between new security requirements and deployment of updated versions of  network functions in operational systems. Two major factors are relevant for this gap: a)  vendors’ responsiveness in issuing and validating new versions of the network functions that  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE FOR 5G NETWORKS  December 2020  71  address the updated requirements, and b) timeliness and effectiveness of MNO processes to  update (e.g. UDM, AUSF, SEPP, NRF, NEF, SMF, AMF and UPF).  IP Based Protocol stack: the use of widely used IP protocols will lead to a shorted vulnerability  exposure time and high impact of vulnerability disclosure.

The implementation of slice security for use cases would rest  ultimately with the Mobile Network Operator (MNO) to include such services in the offer,  depending on its service strategy, market context, and in relation to vertical use-cases. This  might the source of vulnerabilities, to be checked for each particular implementation.  Resource isolation: While network slicing offers the ability of isolation to be used in various  scenarios, the proper isolation technique has to be suited to the use case at hand. Security  requirements of the particular use case will be an important element of consideration for the  selection of proper isolation mechanisms.  Secure Management and Orchestration: The architecture of the network slice MANO is  challenging from a business model perspective. This high complexity and flexibility, which bring  in higher security risks. Due to not finalized 3GPP specifications of authorisation of service  management requests, implementation weaknesses may arise.  Trust Model: The building of trust to MNO capabilities for the various 5G operation models has  to be based of the specified APIs. It needs to be assessed, if these APIs are sufficient for all  three defined operation models and how implementation will use them, in order to avoid  vulnerabilities in the management functions.  Besides these areas of vulnerability, virtualization vulnerabilities are also applicable, as well as  generic vulnerabilities related to soft- and hardware maintenance and hardening. The following  table provides a more exhaustive view on vulnerabilities of network slicing components.

ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE FOR 5G NETWORKS  December 2020  76  4.4 VULNERABILITY GROUPS FOR RADIO ACCESS NETWORK  In the security considerations of radio access network, we have identified the following areas of  vulnerabilities:  Security of Ultra-Reliable Low-Latency Communication (URLLC): weaknesses in the  implementation of QoS may impact low-latency requirements. Optimization issues of control  and user plane will affect reliability and low latency of communications.  Vulnerability to Radio Jamming Attacks: an inherent weakness of wireless cellular  communications is the free frequency space that allows for intentional or unintentional  interferences. They can impact access of legitimate users and cause resilience issues in parts  of the network.  Failure to meet General Security Assurance Requirements: a set of weaknesses will arise  through the update requirements of various elements of RAN due to implementation of  migration steps and the ability of early-deployed systems to comply with specification updates  regarding security functions.  Optional nature of security controls for F1 interface: the optionality of security controls for this  protocol may lead to security weaknesses in its implementation.

Localisation of functions: while physical functions of previous mobile networks have not allowed  for mobility of functions, the introduced virtualization may lead to moving virtualized functions  outside their original location, notably outside the perimeter of protecting measures/policies.  Besides these areas of vulnerability, virtualization vulnerabilities are also applicable, as well as  generic vulnerabilities related to soft- and hardware maintenance and hardening.

Such attacks are based on input buffer analysis to identify  forwarding policy and eventually perform manipulations based on the analysis results.  Data Plane: As SDN data planes are just simple forwarding elements with no embedded  intelligence, they may become targets of protocol attacks, exploiting protocol vulnerabilities in  the forwarding devices.  Programmable Interfaces (APIs): The Southbound API may be misused for a series of attacks.  These attacks are based on inferred flow rules in SDN through packet probing. Knowing the  reactive rules, attackers can launch DoS attacks by sending numerous rule-matched packets  which trigger packet-in packets to overburden the controller.  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE FOR 5G NETWORKS  December 2020  81  Besides these areas of vulnerability, virtualization vulnerabilities are also applicable, as well as  generic vulnerabilities related to soft- and hardware maintenance and hardening.

ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE FOR 5G NETWORKS  December 2020  82  4.7 VULNERABILITY GROUPS FOR MULTI-ACCESS EDGE COMPUTING  In the security considerations of multi-access edge computing, we have identified the following  areas of vulnerabilities:  Virtualization and containerization: Being based on virtualization and containerization, MEC  may be vulnerable to a number of threats emerging from these technologies. Examples are:  possible contamination of shared hardware resources, abuse of privilege elevation  vulnerabilities of containers with higher levels of privileges, dependencies to central  orchestration functions, high data and session volumes that can be subject of attacks, use of  open-source APIs.  Physical security: flaws in physical security of MEC hardware may render such infrastructures  vulnerable to physical attack. Given the fact of higher geographical distribution of such  infrastructures, keeping a uniform level of physical security will be a challenge.  Application-Programming Interfaces (APIs): Though a dedicated architecture (CAPIF) is  proposed to cope with access to APIs, it has to be ensured that these provisions are followed  during API design and implementation phases. As being exposed to user access, usually such  APIs are subject to multiple attacks.  Regulatory issues: European regulation (NIS-Directive), foresees an isolation of physical and  logical components of critical services from services with low criticality. The implementation of  requirement in MEC may lead to vulnerabilities of low criticality services, as they are going to be  operated in a security domain with less security functions.  The table below provides a more exhaustive view on vulnerabilities of MEC components.

Hence, it can be considered that the entire set of  vulnerabilities assessed for all other zoom-ins cover the full set of security vulnerabilities.  4.9 VULNERABILITY GROUPS FOR PHYSICAL INFRASTRUCTURE  In the security considerations of physical infrastructure, we have identified some areas of  vulnerabilities. Given the fact that the physical infrastructure is the common basis for the  implementation of all other zoom-ins, the assessed physical vulnerabilities are derived by the  vulnerabilities of all zoom-ins by means of their relevance to the physical components. Hence,  the vulnerabilities below draw consequences of the vulnerabilities mentioned in other zoom-ins,  by concentrating on their physical aspects:  Impact of virtualisation: The physical measures/controls will need to be derived by and be  complementary to weaknesses encountered by the implementation of functions in containerized  and virtualized environments (see also vulnerabilities of MEC in section 4.7 above). This will  mainly impact physical availability measures for the concerned functions.  General physical security considerations: General physical measures need to be developed  based on vulnerabilities and resulting risk-exposure that are related to the operational needs,  supply chain of various components (delivery, operation, implementation, maintenance) and  criticality of services. Given the large number of roles involved in 5G infrastructures, the  identification of physical vulnerabilities requires a holistic approach.  Threats to edge cloud computing resources: attack surface reduction of MEC services will rely  on physical measures taken for the relevant components (see also vulnerabilities in section 4.7  above).  Vulnerability of wireless frequencies to jamming attacks: as a high number of wireless  connections are involved in the communication within the 5G infrastructure, both in the public  and non-public domain, physical measures for the reduction of impact of jamming attacks need  to be taken into account, especially on availability of communication channels.  The following table provides a more exhaustive view on vulnerabilities of physical infrastructure.  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE FOR 5G NETWORKS  December 2020  85  Name Description  Relevant toolbox  measures  Threat  categories  Improper physical  security of  communication  centres  Communication centres should provide a full set of  physical and environmental controls aimed to assure  access control, monitoring, continuity of operations  and protection against environmental disasters.

Failure to  do so may lead to unauthorised access, destruction of  assets and impairment of operations.  TM06, TM11 PA, DIS, OUT,  NAA-CSVS  Vulnerability to  Radio Jamming  Attacks  Wireless cellular networks are inherently vulnerable to  interference. This weakness can be used to cause  intentional interference and hinder legitimate user’s  communication over specific wireless channels. 5G  improves resilience against jamming attacks over the  4G LTE, but remains vulnerable to customised attacks.  Jamming attacks are a special concern for mission- critical applications, in particular for their availability.  NAA-DoS  Vulnerabilities  related to  virtualisation  technologies  Softwarisation and virtualization of functions only  increase availability and integrity requirements for  shared physical resources, some of them placed in  remote locations. Relevant vulnerabilities include:  • Improper protection of access to physical  interfaces;  • Shared resource contamination;  • Vulnerable mechanisms for Hardware-Based Root  of Trust (HBRT);  • Hypervisor vulnerabilities conduct to cross-  contamination of shared resources;  • Improper availability arrangements for hardware  infrastructure.

ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE FOR 5G NETWORKS  December 2020  86  4.10 VULNERABILITY GROUPS FOR IMPLEMENTATION OPTIONS  In the security considerations of 5G implementation options – migration paths, we have  identified the following areas of vulnerabilities:  Risks related to legacy technologies: these risks materialize through exploitation of  vulnerabilities that are concerned with mismatches of functionalities of non-standalone 5G  networks (NSA) to the current specifications. An example hereto are the use of the LTE Evolved  Packet Core (EPC) and the LTE control panel. In this way, for NSA 5G networks, threats and  vulnerabilities of the LTE technology will persist.  Roaming: during migration, 4G roaming is being used for 5G. This roaming does not include the  new 5G security functions, while maintaining Diameter, SIP/VoLTE and possibly SS7. These  protocols are vulnerable to eavesdropping and tracking.  Security update gap between new security requirements and deployment of updated versions of  network functions in operational systems. Two major factors are relevant for this gap: a)  vendors’ responsiveness in issuing and validating new versions of the network functions that  address the updated requirements, and b) timeliness and effectiveness of MNO processes to  update. This may lead to vulnerabilities in operational NSA 5G infrastructures.  Besides these areas of vulnerability, virtualization vulnerabilities are also applicable to  implementation options. The table below provides a more exhaustive view on vulnerabilities of  components used within 5G implementation options.  Name Description  Relevant toolbox  measures  Threat  categories  Vulnerabilities of  legacy technologies  Vulnerabilities inherited from the LTE system include:  • Lack of integrity protection of over-the-air User  Plane traffic;  • Exposure of international mobile subscriber  identities (IMSI) over the air;  • Weaker cryptographic algorithms.  TM05 NAA-AIL, NAA- SGN, EIH  Improper  implementation of  updated security  functions  The updated requirements for LTE critical components  involved in Non-standalone implementations include  security controls for known vulnerabilities and allow  interoperability by the 5G Components. Failure to meet  assurance specification as defined in the Security  Assurance Specification for critical components leave  open vulnerabilities. The affected components are:  • Vulnerabilities in MME implementation;  • Vulnerabilities in evolved Node B (eNB)  implementation.

TM04 NAA-AVM, FM  LTE Roaming  vulnerabilities  5G NSA roaming is essentially 4G roaming. From a  security perspective, a 5G NSA roaming connection  introduces no new protections since it continues to use  Diameter, SIP/VoLTE and possibly SS7.

ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE FOR 5G NETWORKS  December 2020  88  4.11 VULNERABILITY GROUPS FOR PROCESSES  In this section we develop a set to vulnerabilities/weaknesses that arise from the absence of  processes pertinent to life-cycle maintenance of systems and applications of the entire 5G  infrastructure. As mentioned in section 3.13, the processes considered are MNO life-cycle  processes, vendor development and product life-cycle, as well as security assurance.

ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE FOR 5G NETWORKS  December 2020  93  5. ASSETS  5.1 ASSET CLASSIFICATION AND MAPPING  One critical and initial step in any threat assessment is to identify and classify the most sensitive  assets that, if compromised, may pose a certain level of risk to an individual or organisation.  These activities are part of the asset security domain that focus on collecting and handling the  information required to define the model and a strategy to protect the attribute and value it  represents. In the 5G context, the monetisation of asset attributes such as network slicing,  cloud and Edge computing are in the centre of the value concept of this new generation of  mobile communications.  The 5G architecture considers four main areas that includes user equipment, radio access  network, core network and data network. In this report, we cover two main areas which are the  most significant on 5G evolution: the core network and radio access. We leave user equipment  and data network for future analysis. In the context of this report, we consider various asset  categories that relate to critical components or entities in a 5G network. These components and  entities are of a heterogeneous nature and require differentiated asset security strategies from  owners and/or stakeholders. For example, the interoperability, multi-level and seamless usage  may result in unauthorised and opportunistic access to the network.  We also identify differentiated roles assumed by various actors (presented in chapter2.1  above2.1 of this report), in the definition and implementation of these asset security strategies.  These however, may change in importance, sensitivity and relevance over time, depending on  the product or service lifecycle stage. Each mapped asset may expose certain vulnerabilities or  weaknesses during the lifecycle that if exploited may pose a threat to the confidentiality,  integrity and availability (CIA triad) of systems and data transmitted of parts or the entire 5G  network.  The scope of this document is not to report on a specific asset inventory but to direct the reader  on where to look when conducting such exercises. The responsibility of mapping the sensitive  assets of network relays with the operator since it depends on the technology used, network  product implemented, processes adopted, type of organisations and the services offered. A  mapping of assets and the CIA Triad is presented Table 3.  In the first version of the ENISA Threat Landscape Report for 5G Networks (ETL5G), we  prepared a categorisation of assets based on a high-level architecture presented in the  document. We also review the importance and relevance of these assets to the CIA triad  properties. The categorisations considered a specific definition of assets based on a GNP  (Generic Network Product) class description. A GNP is a class of network products that  implement a common set of 3GPP-defined functionalities for a particular component. According  to 3GPP, the critical assets of GNP to be protected are:   User account data and credentials (e.g. passwords);   Log data;   Configuration data, e.g. GNP's IP address, ports, VPN ID, Management Objects (e.g.  user group, command group) etc.   Operating System (OS), i.e. the files that make up the OS and its processes (code and  data);  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE FOR 5G NETWORKS  December 2020  94   GNP Application;   Sufficient processing capacity: that processing powers are not consumed close to  limits;   Hardware, e.g. mainframe, board, power supply unit etc.   The interfaces of GNP to be protected and which are within SECAM scope: for  example  o Console interface, for local access: local interface on MME  o OAM interface, for remote access: interface between MME and OAM system  o GNP Software: binary code or executable code  All the above critical assets from release 15 of the 3GPP Security Assurance Specification  (SCAS) fit in the asset categories defined in the first edition of the ETL5G.  In this edition, we update the asset categorisations based on new requirements introduced by  release 16 of the 3GPP technical specifications and the new 5G use cases. We classified the  sensitive assets considering the stages of the implementation lifecycle using the eTOM –  enhanced Telecom Operation Map86 as a guide. We assume that certain assets gain a  particular importance or sensitiveness during different stages of the GNP lifecycle. We also  update the information about stakeholders from the previous edition and correlate it with the  new asset categorisation.  5.2 NEW ASSET CATEGORIES  The following 5G asset categories derive from the high-level architecture presented in chapter  3.2 of this report and classification based on release 16 of the 3GPP technical specifications.  The high number of sensitive assets identified from the architecture resulted in a complex and  large diagram, making it difficult to read and display in this report. We use part of the diagram to  depict each asset group. The diagram is structured using asset groups according to their  exposure to threats. By taking into account the role of assets in maintaining the security-related  properties of confidentiality, availability and integrity (known as CIA triad), an initial assessment  of their importance has been developed. In doing so, the emphasis has been given to asset  groups responsible for maintaining the overall security and availability of the 5G infrastructure  and that are known targets of cyber-attacks.  This new categorisation introduces new groups at the lower or more detailed level of the asset  classification, deriving from the requirements of release 16. Another important aspect is the  definition of a high-level classification introducing main categories. These main categories,  depicted in Figure 15, include components and entities from management & orchestration,  network products, protocols, data, interconnections, services, processes and organisation. The  main advantage of having this new upper level is to allow the possibility to define different asset  security strategies depending on the characteristics of each asset group. The assets in these  groups share important characteristics such as type of vulnerabilities, stakeholders and  controls. These characteristics change quite substantially and require differentiated approaches  in the asset security strategy. A complete diagram of the asset map is present in Figure  in  Annex A.  86 http://casewise.tmforum.org/evolve/statics/frameworx/#cwtype=index&cwview=home, accessed November 2020.  http://casewise.tmforum.org/evolve/statics/frameworx/#cwtype=index&cwview=home  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE FOR 5G NETWORKS  December 2020  95  Figure 15: Main categories of 5G network assets  Network Products: This main category includes network planes, functions and elements.  These derive into multiple asset groups that could be found in the previous asset mapping like  core functions, physical infrastructure, security, software-defined networking (SDN), among  others. The main category is a core part of the 5G architecture and one of the most critical in  any 5G asset mapping.  Figure 16: 5G Asset groups from the Network Products category  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE FOR 5G NETWORKS  December 2020  96  Figure 16 depicts the second, third and fourth level groups of the Network Products asset  category. However, not all levels are displayed; hence, we present the full diagram at ENISA  website87 using an interactive tool to explore the inwards of the different asset categories.  Management and orchestration: This main category includes the management of network  functions, network slicing, operations support system, network/element (EMS/NMS) and SDN  Controller. Figure 17 depicts the different asset groups of MANO.  MANO is the most vital part of the 5G infrastructure since is responsible for controlling the entire  set of network functions, their virtualisation and entire software lifecycle related hereto. The  main parts of MANO are the Network Function Virtualisation (NFV) orchestrator, the Virtual  Network Function (VNF) manager, and the virtualised infrastructure manager. Given its  important role, MANO is going to be exposed to numerous attacks with potential major impact  on the entire managed 5G infrastructure environment. The assets of MANO are also depicted in  detail in the corresponding ‘Zoom-in’ in the 5G architecture chapter 3.5.  Figure 17: Asset groups from the Management & Orchestration category  Protocols: This main category of 5G assets include IP and cellular stack. ENISA reviewed the  legacy protocols SS7 and Diameter in a study conducted in 201888. Early generations of mobile  networks such as 2G and 3G rely on these protocols that still contain many critical  vulnerabilities yet to be resolved. 5G networks will need to support SS7 and Diameter for the  foreseeable future (decades) in order to maintain global connectivity (roaming). Figure 18  depicts the various groups of assets associated with protocols typically implemented in a 5G  Network.  Figure 18: Asset groups from the Protocols category  Interconnections: This main category of 5G assets include home/visitor PLMN, security Edge  Protection Proxy (SEPP), packet data network gateway (PGW), N3IWF - Non-3GPP  87 https://www.enersec.net/Asset_MM/ accessed October 2020.  88 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/signalling-security-in-telecom-ss7-diameter-5g, accessed October 2020.  https://www.enersec.net/Asset_MM/ https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/signalling-security-in-telecom-ss7-diameter-5g  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE FOR 5G NETWORKS  December 2020  97  Interworking, trusted non-3GPP Gateway Function (TNGF), wireline Access Gateway Function  (W-AGF) and trusted WLAN Interworking Function (TWIF) asset groups. Figure 19 depicts the  various assets groups associated with interconnections that could be implemented in a 5G  Network.  Figure 19: Asset groups from the Interconnections category  Data: This main category of 5G assets include user, application, system, network, SDN and  security data. This asset group includes the entire data catalogue required in any 5G operation  combined with used data. Though not necessarily exhaustive at this stage of the analysis, this  asset group covers information related to: user data, system and configuration data, security-  related data, network data (configuration, edge, logs, API-data, SDN-data, etc.). It is expected  that 5G data such as user, security and configuration information will be subject to cyber-  attacks with the aim to breach them. Main motives are monetisation and unnoticed access to  the network.  Figure 20: Asset groups from the data category  Services: This main of 5G assets include the use cases, multi-edge computing (MEC) and cloud  service asset groups. These services are directly related with the asset monetisation model of a  5G Network and consequently represents part of the value generated that needs to be protected.  In this version of the 5GTL we review assets that support the value generation model but not the  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE FOR 5G NETWORKS  December 2020  98  model itself. These were already covered by ENISA in previous work (cloud computing,  autonomous vehicles, IIOT89) or are part of recommendations for future research work.  Figure 21: Asset groups from the Services category  Processes: This main category of 5G assets include the MNO and the product development  lifecycle processes. All these processes are vital in a secure and reliable implementation of a  5G Network.  Figure 22: Asset groups from the Processes category  89 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications accessed October 2020.  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE FOR 5G NETWORKS  December 2020  99  Organisation: This main category of 5G assets include time, legal, policy, business support  systems (BSS) and human assets.  Many components in this asset category were also included in the previous mapping. For  example, human assets are considered an important group since humans represent all  individuals involved in the operation and use of the 5G network. Time for example plays a  significant role in many time-dependent functions. With release 16 and the introduction of  mission-critical uses cases requiring constant time synchronisation (e.g. ITS, V2X, IIoT and  URLLC), this asset plays an even more important role in a 5G Network.  Figure 23: Asset groups from the Organisation category  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE FOR 5G NETWORKS  December 2020  100  5.3 ASSET CLASSIFICATION AND THE CIA TRIAD  In the following table, we provide the relevance of the identified asset groups with regard to the CIA  triad.  Table 3: Relevance of asset groups to the maintenance of CIA properties  Asset C CIA Triad  Confidentiality Integrity Availability  Management &  orchestration  ● ● ●  Network products ● ● ●  Protocols ● ●  Data ● ● ●  Interconnections ● ● ●  Services ● ● ●  Processes ● ● ●  Organisation ● ● ●  Legend:  Very high relevance of asset group to maintain the property:  ●  High relevance of asset group to maintain the property:  ●  Medium relevance of asset group to maintain the property:  ●  Low relevance of asset group to maintain the property:  ●  Very low relevance of asset group to maintain the property:  ●  The assignment of these security properties has been performed at the level of asset groups. We  recommend performance of this exercise in higher detail, depending on the focus of prospective  threat assessments. In this case, to achieve a more precise mapping, users of this document  should obtain a more accurate internal evaluation of these properties.  Concluding this chapter, it is worth mentioning that due to its complexity and the early stage of 5G  networks (development, deployment, specification) the asset mapping is an ongoing task that will  need some time to reach a mature stage. This is due to a variety of reasons/issues regarding the  parameters of current 5G activities (narrow time windows for the creation of reports, resource  issues, knowledge transfer, vendor’s enrolment, etc.). These challenges will be sufficiently  managed in future assessment of 5G threats.  5.4 THE RELEVANCE OF ASSETS THROUGHOUT THE LIFECYCLE  The following table presents the relevance of the identified asset groups with regard to the 5G  network lifecycle.

To complement the analysis, we added the potential impact  and information about the affected assets. We used ENISA threat taxonomy to group these  threats in one common list. In this edition, we continued reviewing the threat landscape by  updating the information from the previous edition and added new elements to the analysis. In  summary, we:  1. reviewed the network architecture based on the specifications defined in release 16 for  a generic network product (GNP);  2. reviewed the asset map based on the revised architecture and product lifecycle;  3. added information about vulnerabilities;  4. made a correlation between sensitive assets and vulnerabilities to look for exploitation  opportunities;  5. used STRIDE90 model to structure the information about threats and;  6. prepared a list combining all the information available about threats, including the ones  from the previous edition and other sources such as 3GPP and GSMA.  As previously mentioned, we used the STRIDE model to structure information about threats.  According to ISO 2700191, a threat can be defined as “the potential cause of an incident that  may result in a breach of information security or compromise business operations.”. In the  context of this report, we collected information about various potential causes of an incident  during the design, build, operation support & readiness and operations (fulfilment and  assurance) of a 5G Network structured in 6 main categories (spoofing identity, tampering,  repudiation, information disclosure, denial of service and elevation of privilege).  6.1 TAXONOMY OF THREATS  With the proliferation of methods, taxonomies and models, it is imperative to establish a  common understanding of the different terms used to describe the threat landscape. It should  start with the categorization of important elements such as assets, vulnerabilities and threats.  For example, the adoption of a common taxonomy in 5G security will help improving  communication among the various stakeholders in policymaking, regulation, product  development, system implementation and operation. For that purpose, ENISA presents a threat  taxonomy in Table 5 Annex B.  6.2 THREAT MAP  At this stage, we have completed the security risk management triangle with information about  assets, vulnerabilities and threats. Conducting a more detailed assessment for a particular  context and use case, it will be possible to complete the entire model. In this revision of the  threat map, we structured the information from the previous edition of this report and generic  threats from 3GPP security assurance specification (SCAS) using the STRIDE model.  90 https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/commerce-server/ee823878(v=cs.20)?redirectedfrom=MSDN,  accessed October 2020.  91 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/threat-risk-management/risk-management/current-risk/laws-regulation/rm-ra- standards/iso-iec-standard-27001, accessed October 2020/  https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/commerce-server/ee823878(v=cs.20)?redirectedfrom=MSDN https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/threat-risk-management/risk-management/current-risk/laws-regulation/rm-ra-standards/iso-iec-standard-27001 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/threat-risk-management/risk-management/current-risk/laws-regulation/rm-ra-standards/iso-iec-standard-27001  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE FOR 5G NETWORKS  December 2020  103  Threat Type Threats Potential Impact Affected Assets  Nefarious Activity/  Abuse of assets (NAA)  Manipulation of network configuration/data forging  -

THREAT AGENTS  The assessed threat agents engaged in attacks of 5G infrastructures remain identical to the  previous edition of the 5G Threat Landscape8. This is due to the fact that there are no insights  about malicious activities targeting 5G infrastructures. Main reasons for this are:   Due to the early stages of 5G deployments, no incidents of attacks to 5G  infrastructures have been identified during 2020;   The threat agent assessment is based on hypothetical attacks;   The current threat landscape is done at the level of specifications. Real attacks will  happen against implementations. This will influence modus operandi;   As business processes that will run of 5G infrastructures are still unknown, it is difficult  to assess threat actor motives other than the obvious state-sponsored interventions.  There are no indications about the most frequent threat of cybercrime.  These points make clear that as the next generation of Mobile Networks (5G) are being  deployed, existing threat agent profiles will develop towards a new set of capabilities and  motives. Nonetheless, without any analysis of specific implementations of 5G infrastructures  and business processes running on these infrastructures, a threat agent assessment can be  performed only at a generic hypothetical level.  Given this the complexity of 5G infrastructures and the ambiguity regarding 5G related attack  vectors, it is expected that the following facts will influence the attacker profile:   A whole set of new vulnerabilities related to individual 5G deployments will expand the  attack surface, exposure, number and nature of critical assets.   New tools/methods to exploit those vulnerabilities will be developed.   New motives/ impacted targets are going to be observed due to the interconnected  verticals/applications.   Existing threat agent groups may be expanded with ones that have an interest in novel  malicious objectives emerging from the upcoming 5G use-cases.  These facts may cause an unprecedented shift of capabilities and objectives of existing threat  agent groups in ways that have not been seen in the past.  Having regard to the above mentioned facts, in the current 5G Threat Landscape, we stick to  the threat agent groups assessed in the previous edition taking into account the following threat  agent groups:   Cyber criminals   Insider (own, third parties)   Nation states   Hacktivists   Cyber-fighters   Cyber-terrorists   Corporations   Script kiddies  Interested readers should revisit the previous 5G Threat Landscape edition8 to find the  descriptions and motives of these threat agent groups.  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE FOR 5G NETWORKS  December 2020  119  For the sake of completeness, we provide below a mapping between threat agents and cyber-  threats used in this report.

Given  the detailed vulnerability analysis presented in this document (see Annexes C-M), it is possible to infer the potential  engagement of these threat agent groups in exploitation campaigns. In this way, a detailed threat agent profiling can be  performed. This task has not been performed in this report. However, it will be subject of prospective ENISA activities in  detailed threat/risk assessments.  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE FOR 5G NETWORKS  December 2020  120  8. RECOMMENDATIONS/  CONCLUSIONS  8.1 RECOMMENDATIONS  Based on the assets, threats and the state-of-play of current developments, the following  recommendations/courses of actions can be made for various stakeholders of the 5G  ecosystem:  Recommended courses of action at EU level (e.g. Member States, European Commission  and ENISA)   It is essential that the EU continues to facilitate the definition of common security standards  across for 5G Networks and its use cases by supporting further cooperation and  information sharing among Member States.   The existing EU 5G observatory93 is a very useful/important resource for dissemination of  content related to 5G, in support of activities of EU 5G Stakeholders. It covers  developments in various areas of 5G, such as status of 5G deployments, relevant MS-  actions, market uptakes, economic aspects of 5G infrastructure development, etc. Besides  this information offering, it is recommended to collect cybersecurity-related market  information, such as the status of specifications, and certification activities, more  systematically, through the appropriate mechanism or forum.   Relevant work of stakeholders (e.g. Member States, MNOs, etc.) regarding prioritisation of  implementation, service criticality assessments, security requirements, etc. should be  consolidated and made available to the 5G community. This could be one of the tasks of  the 5G observatory mentioned above.   It is important to deliver developed CTI in a form that can be more easily utilised by  interested stakeholders. A possible way to achieve this can be by means of a 5G CTI  repository offering querying facilities based on various criteria (i.e. such as threat exposure,  vulnerabilities per asset type, threats per attacker type, mapping of roles and assets, etc.).   In orchestration with the above-mentioned recommendations, critical 5G services should be  identified and implemented. Main objective of this action is could be to develop a security  assurance scheme that could drive certifications on 5G equipment, software and  processes. In all cases, a risk-based approach should be followed. CTI provided within this  report should be adapted where necessary and taken into account within the risk  assessment and the evaluation of attacker potential.   As the proliferation of AI algorithms has reached components used in the 5G ecosystem, it  is proposed to assess the threat exposure such functions throughout the components of  the entire 5G ecosystem (devices, EPROMs, software, sensors, actuators, etc.). This  activity overlaps with current ENISA work on an AI Threat Landscape, whereas a more  deep assessment w.r.t. 5G could be done in prospective versions of the 5G Threat  Landscape, when more information about such functions will be available.   Through the performed threat analysis, it has been recognised that some work needs to be  done in the area of 5G threat agent profiling and in the identification of possible attack  vectors. Given the rudimentary information available for both topics and the level of  93 https://5gobservatory.eu, accessed November 2020.  https://5gobservatory.eu/  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE FOR 5G NETWORKS  December 2020  121  available information processed (mainly specification level), at this point of time a profiling  would be premature. Nonetheless, this work is considered as a priority for future versions  of the 5G Threat Landscape, given the availability of more information on both threat  agents and attack vectors.  Recommendations for 5G market stakeholders (e.g. vendors, MNOs, Operators of  Services, Standardisation Bodies, 5G Test Labs, etc.)   More detailed mappings of asset/role responsibilities and vulnerabilities/threats could  enhance the utilisation of the produced CTI. This process could be steered by means of  identified priorities and asset criticalities assessed via market analysis, stakeholder surveys  and 5G rollout activities of MNOs.   A detailed cap analysis for the protection of various 5G assets needs to be performed.  Besides organisational issues, such a gap analysis will be needed for  migration/implementation options.   The specification of 5G provides a solid basis for the security of the entire system.  Nonetheless, the final security level will heavily depend on implementation/coding  practices. The development of good practices/guidelines for the secure implementation of  network functions is an important step towards maintaining the security level of the  specification in the resulting code-base. Such guidelines do not yet exist.   The terminology used in various published 5G documents (specifications, standardisation  documentation, research projects, etc.) needs to be consolidated. This will facilitate  homogeneity in references to important security concepts (e.g. threats, vulnerabilities,  impact, responsibilities, stakeholders, etc.) and will contribute to an elevation of  understanding and utilization of the produced material.   Some operational, general-purpose process models and frameworks do exist in the area of  telecommunication. They cover network management, vendor and security assurance  processes. Though making up a very good starting point for 5G infrastructures, they might  entail gaps w.r.t. specialised 5G operational issues. It is proposed to perform a systematic  gap analysis of these frameworks to test their 5G adequacy and fill the identified gaps.  Recommendations for national competent bodies in the area of 5G cybersecurity (e.g.  NRAs, NCSCs, National 5G Test Centres, etc.)   With guidance from current 5G deployments (including migration options), more exhaustive  gap analysis on various areas of cybersecurity measures, should be performed. This  information will contribute to the advancement of current cybersecurity practices. The  delivered CTI of this report can serve as key input towards a risk and threat based  approach.  While the above may be advisable future actions for various stakeholder groups, ENISA  envisages an involvement in the following actions e.g. on behalf/on request of EU, MS   It is important to deliver developed CTI in a form that can be more easily utilised by  interested stakeholders. A possible way to achieve this can be by means of a 5G CTI  repository offering querying facilities based on various criteria (i.e. such as threat exposure,  vulnerabilities per asset type, threats per attacker type, mapping of roles and assets, etc.).   Fostering the use of the released CTI within implementation projects and establishment of  feedback will be an important element for the improvement of the presented material and  enhancement of 5G technical and operational cybersecurity.   Performance of risk assessments for specific parts of the 5G infrastructure will lead to  better utilisation of the information delivered in the present report and will reveal areas of  improvement of the provided analysis. A pilot on a security assurance scheme for  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE FOR 5G NETWORKS  December 2020  122  certification of identification service is planned by ENISA for the coming semester.  Information from the present report will flow into this activity during the risk assessment  phase.   Besides integrating feedback from implementations, processes and detailed assessments,  prospective versions of the 5G threat landscape need to be linked to planned versions of  5G specification activities, in particular regarding the work of 3GPP group.  8.2 CONCLUSIONS  Having reached a good degree of comprehensiveness and detail within this version of the 5G  Threat Landscape, it is proposed to put the focus on utilization within upcoming activities at EU  level, Member States and MNOs. By means of the identified recommendations, this objective  can be achieved. Just as in the previous edition of the 5G Threat Landscape, it will be important  to use this material in various stakeholder activities, identify current and future developments  and try to accommodate those in future versions of the present report.  Such activities, if performed in a coordinated manner, will speed up implementation of  measures developed by various actors (i.e. EU toolbox measures, specified security measures,  development of 5G good practices for operation and security assurance).  ENISA will continue engaging within cybersecurity activities of 5G. Coordination with EU-wide  activities will be key to the success of this attempt.  Future ENISA actions on this matter will be agreed upon, mandated and coordinated with  European Commission and Member States (NIS CG SG on 5G) as deemed necessary.

If this overwrites  adjacent data or executable code, this  may result in erratic program behaviour,  including memory access errors,  incorrect results, and crashes.  Exploiting the behaviour of a buffer  overflow is a well-known security exploit.  By sending in data designed to cause a  buffer overflow, it is possible to write into  memory areas known to hold executable  code and replace it with malicious code,  or to selectively overwrite data  pertaining to the program's state,  therefore causing behaviour that was not  intended by the original programmer.

[Security-02]  Virtualisation vulnerabilities of relevant MEC components  Vulnerable  virtualisation /  container /  micro-service  environment  Security risks and concerns around  virtual IT systems can be broadly  classified into three types:  1.  Architectural: The layer of abstraction  between physical hardware and  virtualized systems running IT services is  a potential target for attack. A VM or  group of VMs connected to the same  network can be the target of attacks from  other VMs on the network. 2. Hypervisor  software: The most important software in  a virtual IT system is the hypervisor. Any  security vulnerability in the hypervisor  and associated infrastructure and  management software / tools puts VMs at  risk. 3. Configuration: Given the ease of  cloning and copying images in a virtual  environment, a new infrastructure can be  deployed very easily. This introduces  configuration drift. As a result, controlling  and accounting for rapidly deployed  environments becomes a critical task.  Virtual  infrastr.,  Virtual  Infrastr.  manager  (VIM)  Best Practices for  Mitigating Risks in  Virtualized  Environments  The design should take into account the  appropriate logical segregation of  instances that contain sensitive data.  During implementation, extensive  assessment of the vulnerability of the  virtualization components is mandatory.  The underlying virtualization platform  should be hardened using vendor- provided guidelines and/or third-party  tools. In a virtualized environment, robust  key management is essential to access  control and proof of ownership for both  data and keys. Role-based access  policies should be enforced to enable  segregation of duties and data. Proper  VM encryption is required to significantly  reduce the risk associated with user  access to physical servers and storage  containing sensitive data.

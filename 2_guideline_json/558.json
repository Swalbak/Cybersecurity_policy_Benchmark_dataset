Introduction  This report focuses on the status of cyber challenge competitions in Europe and their  implementation. The European Commission’s joint communication to the European Parliament, the  Council, the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions  ‘Cybersecurity strategy of the European Union: an open, safe and secure cyberspace’ (1) suggests  that the Commission  organise, with the support of ENISA, a cybersecurity championship  where university students will compete in proposing network and information security (NIS)  solutions. In order to help develop the planning for this Europe-wide endeavour, this report provides  information on current national efforts that can be used as the starting point for the pan European  challenge.  Goal  The aim of this report is to provide up-to-date information about current cyberchallenge  competitions taking place in Europe. The experiences of all the Member State will be considered  later on, when establishing the general framework for the development of a pan-European  competition for students.  Target audience  The primary audience for this report is national experts already involved in, or interested in,  cyberchallenge competitions. However, the information within it will also be useful for a broader  public including policymakers and NIS educators .  Structure  This report provides a general overview of existing cyberchallenge competitions in Member States,  as well as a roadmap for a future pan-European cyberchallenge competition. The first part presents  the experience of five countries. The second part comprises of a short ‘how to’ guide containing the  steps in organising a challenge. The third part goes into more detail on concrete developments  concerning a pan-European challenge. The fourth and final part contains several recommendations  that should be taken into account. Graphics providing additional content can be found in the annex.  Additionally, the authors of this report are opening up a wider consultation and stakeholders  interested in this work are invited to contact the Cyber Challenge Competition Committee in order  to join the initiative (2).

Presentation of existing cyberchallenge competitions in Europe  This chapter presents existing competitions and their results. Some basic information is contained in  the table below.  Organiser Name of the  challenge  Date Periodicity  Austria Austrian Cyber  Security Challenge  From May 2014 to November  2014  Annual  Switzerland Swiss Cyber Storm  From May 2014 to  November  2014  Romania D-CTF  From October 2014 to  November 2014  Spain Spanish CyberCamp  From October 2014 to  December 2014  United  Kingdom  Cyber Security  Challenge  All year  About Cyber Security Austria (3)  ‘Cyber Security Austria — Association to promote the safety of Austrian strategic infrastructure’ is a  non-profit, independent and non-party organisation, whose goal is to sponsor and promote security  awareness in Austria and to encourage the IT security of strategic infrastructure.The honorary  members of the association want, in particular, to collect, link, facilitate and publish existing  competencies.  About Swiss Cyber Storm (4)  The message is ‘ Meet the future talent’.  Swiss Cyber Storm, founded on 15 November 2012, is a non-profit organisation that conducts the  Swiss Cyber Storm IT security conferences and cybersecurity challenges. It organises the annual  Cyber Security Challenge, whose 2014 edition will be the largest contest in the search for  Switzerland’s most promising young cybersecurity talents, to promote their abilities and to convince  them to pursue a career in cybersecurity.  About Defcamp Romania (5)  Defcamp Capture the Flag (D-CTF) is an innovative and ground-breaking security capture-the-flag  (CTF) competition in central and eastern Europe. The most skilful hackers and IT geeks put their  knowledge to the test and try to get into the ‘best of the best’ top five, in the hope that they can win  the overall event or ‘die trying’. There is one important rule — hack before getting hacked!  (3) Further information at http://www.cybersecurity.at (currently only in German).

It is a cybersecurity challenge for best spanish students and researchers in cybersecurity as well as  best international talented professionals by different competitions and advanced challenges  designed by INTECO and several stakeholders. The event will allow the industry participation by  presenting success cases.  The event (which first edition is scheduled from October to December 2014), include online  challenges, training labs, CTF, wargames, hackathons as well as tracks to foster enterpreneurship in  Cybersecurity with speed dating slots with investors.  In its first edition, the physical event will take place in December between 5th and 7th in Madrid.  About Cyber Security Challenge UK (7)  Cyber Security Challenge UK Ltd is a not-for-profit company, formed in March 2010, to plug the  cybersecurity skills gap in the United Kingdom. Some 90 % of professionals surveyed had difficulties  in recruiting the cybersecurity talent needed by their companies, across all eight categories of  cybersecurity jobs. Nearly 60 % predicted (correctly) an increase in the number of jobs in the UK  cybersecurity market.  2.1 Workshop in April 2014  As a first step to kick off the work (8), ENISA opened a public call and invited stakeholders to a  common meeting. A workshop on ‘Cybersecurity challenges in Europe’ was organised on 29 April in  Brussels. The main goal was to look at what is being done in the area of cybersecurity and how this  could be coordinated. The talks, which lasted for half a day, covered a large range of initiatives  throughout Europe for identifying (mostly young) people with a talent for advanced activities in  cybersecurity — and for recruiting them to work in this area. Speakers gave an overview of activities  including hackathons, red team/blue team and CTF games, SWOT analyses and speed dating. In  addition to these more competitive styles, more standard university-level courses were described.  Speed dating and forms of mentoring are two of the ways in which participants can enter into  contact with professionals in the field, a factor that was recognised by many speakers as being  extremely conducive to the success of the activities.  In Sections 2.2 to 2.7, the competitions presented at the workshop will be described in detail. The  remainder of Section 2.1 contains additional observations and conclusions from the workshop.  All these activities focus on people who are suited to being security experts — but the actions (or  non-actions) of non-expert computer or data users also determine security and privacy outcomes.  This was the specific topic of a presentation at the workshop on the classification of security types,  which outlined how too much attention is currently being paid to perimeter security — which means  that once an attacker has gained access to the area inside the perimeter (premises, the computer  system, etc.), there is a lot of potential damage, because management control, operational controls  and internal security measures are often lacking. Interestingly, according to the presentation, this is  very different in other security fields such as chemical, biological and nuclear security. It was pointed  (6)  Further information will be available at Website: http://cybercamp.es  (publicly available from September 2014)  (7) Further information at http://cybersecuritychallenge.org.uk/  (8) Rapporteur Bettina Berendt, KU Leuven, Belgium (http://people.cs.kuleuven.be/~bettina.berendt).  http://cybersecuritychallenge.org.uk/ http://people.cs.kuleuven.be/~bettina.berendt  Cybersecurity competitions — the status in Europe  October 2014  Page  4  out that training and awareness raising are needed, and that these activities have to take into  account specific user needs and insights about human learning. Standards can play several roles in  increasing security, including conveying the notion that an individual company or institution is not  alone with specific security problems.  Other presentations also emphasised the need for ‘specialised experts’ of various kinds and  mentioned the diversity of the target groups for concrete types of events. For example, Symantec’s  Cyber Readiness Challenge ‘can accommodate very different levels of skills’, and the DefCamp  hacking conference recently started organising capture-the-flag exercises for children (DefCamp  Kids). The Uk Cyber Security Challenge provides safe environments where people can test and  demonstrate their skills; and showcases the spread of opportunities for future cyber defenders as  well as informs participants about available education and training opportunities.  The short discussion centred on two, related questions. One was the question of how a hard-to- reach but important target group, a range of SMEs, could profit from the activities described. Cisco  called on universities to use the Cisco courses also in teaching activities aimed at a wider audience  (including SMEs), and Symantec offers awareness-raising tools for the general public. Another  question was to what extent the didactic approaches described above could also be employed in  training and awareness-raising for non-expert computer/data users. This might be beneficial  because the didactic style is more hands-on and constructivist than the more frequently used  ‘lecture-style’ teaching activities — and thus more likely to be successful in the area of security  where not only knowledge but also practices shape outcomes. However, many questions will need  to be addressed.  The restricted time of the workshop did not permit an in-depth discussion of this question. Professor  Berendt, who was the rapporteur for this session, has additional useful thoughts based on her own  experience: ‘Users’ contexts and ways of learning would have to be taken seriously. Such training  forms, and of course the good security and privacy practices they are meant to create or sustain,  cost time and resources, and people cannot reasonably be expected to do this on the side in  addition to all their other tasks. Managers, teachers, etc. thus need to commit more deeply than .  just giving lecture-style instructions, also questioning their own practices. Trade-offs (e.g. with costs,  labour, flexibility, hierarchy) will need to be taken into account, and organisations will have to  confront and address the conflicts that can arise between different stakeholders, user roles, etc. This  non-uniqueness of the notions of security and privacy will probably be among the most challenging,  but also most interesting, aspects of future education and training.  Cybersecurity competitions — the status in Europe  October 2014  Page  5  2.2 Austrian competition  Austria’s search for cybersecurity talent (9)  Cyber Security Austria (CSA) organises an annual contest in cooperation with the Ministry of Defence  and Sport.  Cyber Security Challenge 2014 is be the largest such contest in the search for the  country’s most promising young hackers, to secure their talents in the long term and to help them  develop into cybersecurity experts of the future. ‘With Cyber Security Challenge 2014, we want to  strengthen the image of the talented local hacker scene due to the first cybersecurity challenge’,  says Joe Pichlmayr, council member for Cyber Security Austria (CSA). ‘We are searching hard for  Austria’s young and up-and-coming IT talent who want to prove their skills in a legal way and want  to compare their knowledge with others in their age group.’  Last year over 600 teenagers participated. This year, a big increase in the number of contestants is  expected as the criteria have been extended to cover university students as the challenge goes into  its third year. Additionally, the potential winner has increased motivation: a place in an international  competition against winners from Germany and Switzerland — the international Cyber Security  Challenge — who will challenge Austria’s finest in the grand finals.  Searching for ‘insanely good’ talent  With the slogan ‘Are you insanely good? Then show us!’, CSA, the Ministry of Defence and Sport  and Kuratorium Sicheres Österreich (KSÖ) are inviting all pupils and students in the country to get  involved with IT security.  ‘For us this contest is not only about finding the best young hacker in Austria: we also want to  understand how far advanced the skills and knowledge of the young people already are,’ says Joe  Pichlmayr. ‘Therefore, we are especially interested in their paths to finding solutions and how they  think, act and process ways to solve various hacks.’  Interested teenagers can register for Cyber Security Challenge Austria 2014 on the official  website (10). The challenge commenced on 6 May 2014. The Hacking Lab — a special kind of Internet  security laboratory — was unlocked on the first day, and it is on that platform that the challenge is  taking place.  ‘Hacking Lab’ as the centrepiece of the challenge  The centrepiece of the challenge is the so-called Hacking Lab. This refers to a remotely controlled  security laboratory, which was developed by Compass Security AG. The laboratory contains 150  different security challenges from all areas of IT, which can be used in the context of the security  challenge. To solve them, the contestants access specifically prepared, vulnerable systems through a  VPN remote connection. Another feature of the Hacking Lab is the option to link tasks with solution  applications, discussion possibilities and scoring.  A challenge for ambitious young hackers  School pupils, young people and students  The tasks are very diverse, requiring pupils and students to successfully pass one or more technical  tests in order to finish the challenge. The solutions are then submitted online to the Hacking Lab.  During the submission, additional questions are posed, such as which IT security breaches were  available, how the security breach could be used and what was the best alternative to protect the  system from these threats.  (9) For further details contact joe.pichlmayr@cybersecurityaustria.at  (10) http://www.verbotengut.at  mailto:joe.pichlmayr@cybersecurityaustria.at http://www.verbotengut.at/  Cybersecurity competitions — the status in Europe  October 2014  Page  6  ‘The Cyber Security Challenge has clear ambitions to educate contestants. It is important for us that  the young people do not only encounter matters of hacking and IT attacks, but must also address  and understand counter-measures. With this action, we want these talented people to have a  certain perspective on the matter, similar to those of IT security experts,’ Joe Pichlmayr says.  How the Cyber Security Challenge works  On the start date on 6 May, all participants received new assignments which are to be solved alone  and creatively. Experts from Cyber Security Austria are conducting ongoing supervision and  performance evaluation, and supporting the contestants as coaches.  The best 10 participants in each of the contests, for school pupils and young people and for  students, qualify for the national finals, which were held from 11 to 14 September 2014 in  Hagenberg.  The two winning teams of pupils and students then represent Team Austria in the international  Cyber Security Challenge. They challenge the winners of the equivalent German and Swiss challenges  at a contest which took place from 3 to 5 November 2014 in Fürstenfeld, during  the largest Austrian  security event, the ICT security conference of the Ministry of Defence and Sport.  Live hacks, finals and appealing prices  The finals took the form of a team competition, where two teams with five people in each have to  compete against each other in different live challenges. The awards ceremony of the Austrian  challenge took place on 13 September 2014 at the Ars Electronica Centre, Linz. The awards  ceremony for the European Cyber Security Challenge 2014 was on 6 November 2014 in the festivities  of the Museum of Military History (Heeresgeschichtliches Museum) in Vienna in the presence of  politicians, economists and representatives of government bodies.  ‘Hire the hackers’ — cybersecurity experts for public authorities and businesses  Beside Cyber Security Austria, the Defence Agency and the Kuratorium Sicheres Österreich (KSÖ) are  also supporting Cyber Security Challenge Austria 2014 and thereby bringing it to the attention of  authorities and businesses.  The Austrian job market is urgently seeking highly qualified IT security experts. The protection of  essential IT infrastructure is becoming more and more important in both the public and private  sectors. To meet this challenge on a long-term basis, young people with talent and enthusiasm for IT  must be encouraged from the earliest age possible and trained to be the future IT security specialists  that the region needs.  ‘For the ÖBH (Army of Austria) to fulfil its goals, it needs a secure and reliable operation with various  ICT systems,’ explains ObstdG Mag. Unger, head of the department for cyberdefence and ICT  security. ‘Furthermore, the ÖBH has [been given] responsibility for cyberdefence. That is why it  needs a large number of highly qualified ICT security experts — firstly, to protect the military ICT  systems and secondly, to help in the cybersecurity area if others cannot continue anymore.’  Therefore the CSA, the Defence Agency and the KSÖ are following the approach of ‘hiring the  hackers’. Young IT talents need to be scouted at an early age and their skills and strengths need to  be developed with the support of public authorities and businesses. ‘Together with the experts from  Cyber Security Austria, we want to establish the crucial job sector of IT security [among young  people] to make Austria more secure,’ adds Kunstmann. ‘The economy knows of its role and  responsibility and supports the challenge on an organisational and financial level.’  Cybersecurity competitions — the status in Europe  October 2014  Page  7  Preventing illegal activities  For the CSA the challenge also has other goals. ‘Through a direct and early approach to youngsters  who are passionate about IT, we want to prevent from them using their knowledge sooner or later  for illegal activities. With the challenge, we set a certain representation in the group of young adults  and deliberately want to encourage them to follow a legal path.’ Participants in Cyber Security  Challenge Austria have to sign a code of ethics, whereby they confirm in writing that they have been  informed about the legal boundaries of hacking, and that they are not allowed to use the techniques  they have learned for abusive purposes.  Widespread support from politicians, economists and government  For Cyber Security Challenge Austria 2014 to meet its goals, the organisers rely on cooperation with  the Ministry for Internal Affairs and the Ministry for Defence and Sport. The Office of the Chancellor,  ENISA and the Federal Agency for IT have also provided support. Financial aid from notable  companies in the sector is also greatly appreciated. Special thanks go to A1 Telekom Austria,  Sprecher-Automation, Philippeit, FabaSoft, Kapsch, ACP, SEC-Consult, IKARUS, Symantec, ArrowECS,  Barracuda, the Computer Company Computershop GesmbH, the WKO — Bundeswirtschaftskammer,  A-Trust and the Bundesrechenzentrum BRZ as well as the University of Applied Science Upper  Austria, the University of Applied Science Technikum Vienna and the University of Applied Science  St Pölten.  Several insights from the Cyber Security Challenge Austria 2012/13  The Cyber Security Challenge 2012/13 gave the organisers many surprising insights and featured  many more ‘wow moments’ than expected. Over 400 pupils and young people took part in the first  challenge, which was conducted through the virtual laboratory environment of the Swiss Compass  Verlag (Hacking Lab). Their performances surprised both the organisers and operators of the hacking  labs. In certain exercises, the solution rate was 10 times higher than for other, comparable  participants who had taken part in the hacking lab. In addition, more contestants than expected  successfully accomplished the hardest tasks available.  The exceptionally high performance level was later confirmed by the  participation of the finalists of the Cyber Security Challenge in other ‘hacker  contests’ with a very high ranking.  The 25 best contestants in the challenge and Cyber Security Austria enjoy a constant dialogue, which  was formed through the Centre of Excellence. In the Centre of Excellence, it has been ascertained  that the participants know very well what is allowed and what is prohibited. They want to distance  themselves from illegal ‘hacks’.  Most of them suffer from the fact that their family and school environment cannot recognise,  appreciate and value their performance and skills — a well-known phenomenon that many very  gifted people have to tolerate. Every one of the top 10 in the challenge can choose from numerous  offers from the business world by this time. Immediately after the contest and awards ceremony,  the finalists received several job offers. In the 2013 challenge, the group of participants was  extended from school pupils and young people to students from universities of applied science and  other universities. The best of the best are determined in two parallel contests and will confront the  winners of the Swiss challenge after the finals. For Cyber Security Austria it is clear that the challenge  needs to be expanded and to establish itself as a ‘high-class-event’. Therefore the bilateral  Cybersecurity competitions — the status in Europe  October 2014  Page  8  competition with the Swiss will only be a first step in the right direction. It will also support  awareness for the construction of the structures that are needed to motivate and develop highly  talented top people.  Further information on Cyber Security Austria (11)  About the Agency of Defence  The Agency of Defence is an intelligence service of the Austrian army with three main tasks — the  classic task of intelligence protection, the perception of military security including ICT security and  the perception of tasks in line with Information Security Law — as well as the ability and  competence to recognise threats to military security in time for them to react with proper counter  measures. With the establishment of military computer emergency readiness teams (MilCERT),  Austria has taken a major step towards a general concept of defence against digital threats. These  capabilities (in cooperation with other departments in the Austrian army) complement special  knowledge in the areas of forensics or the audits of rooms and facilities.  2.3 Swiss competition  The Swiss Cyber Storm association organised the 2014 edition of its annual Cyber Security Challenge.  This was the largest contest in the search for the country’s most promising young cybersecurity  talents, to promote their skills and to convince them to pursue a career in cybersecurity. In 2013,  over 200 contestants participated. A slight increase in contestants was registered in 2014, as the  participant criteria have been modified to include people who have completed their bachelor’s  degree — but do not hold a higher degree — and are no older than 30 years. Furthermore, the fact  that the international competition in which the winning team can participate has been extended  from two to three countries (the others are Austria and Germany) should make the challenge more  attractive.  Basic idea and target audience  The challenge is very diverse in that pupils and students have to successfully pass one or more  technical tasks in order to finish it. The solutions are then submitted online to a Hacking Lab. A  solution consists not only of how the problem was solved but also how the underlying weakness in  the software/hardware/system architecture or similar (if any) would have to be modified to fix or  prevent it. By requiring this additional step, Swiss Cyber Storm stresses its ambitions to educate  contestants.  Swiss Cyber Storm wants young people not only to be met with matters of  hacking and IT attacks, but also to learn to address and understand counter-  measures.  Hacking Lab: providing a platform for cybersecurity challenges  The centrepiece of the challenge is the ‘Hacking Lab’ — an online platform offering a controlled  security laboratory developed by Compass Security AG. The laboratory offers free access to a limited  set of security challenges, for example those published by OWASP, but it can also be used to  (11) http://www.cybersecurity.at  http://www.cybersecurity.at/  Cybersecurity competitions — the status in Europe  October 2014  Page  9  establish public and private security challenges or to do security training. To solve the challenges,  the contestants usually download a live CD or virtual machine image (e.g. for VMWare). Both of  these come with all the required tools pre-installed and offer a one-click solution to initiate the VPN  connection to the security laboratory from where the specifically prepared systems for the  challenges are accessible. However, some of the challenges can also be solved locally. For challenge  organisers, the Hacking Lab offers convenient management and teacher views which make things  like rating submissions and providing feedback to the contestants easy. The Hacking Lab platform is  basically open to anyone. It attracts a large community of people from all over, some of whom even  actively propose and create new security challenges. Currently, there are over 150 security  challenges in domains like web application security, forensics, malware analysis, cryptography,  mobile device security, operating systems security and reverse engineering. Compass Security AG  says it is also very open to academic partners: it cooperates, for example, with the universities of  applied sciences in Zurich (ZHAW) and Bern (BFH).  Organisation and support  The Swiss Cyber Storm Security Challenge is organised by a committee consisting of members of the  Swiss Cyber Storm association and works on an unsalaried basis. In 2014, the Swiss government is  supporting this effort with patronage from the Swiss Reporting and Analysis Centre for Information  Assurance (Melani) (12) and the Swiss Police ICT association (13) (German and French only). This  association sponsors the annual Swiss police computer science congress, SPIK, whose goal is to make  all involved specialists and managers of police forces, the IT industry and politicians familiar with  new ideas, developments and products. A political committee with representatives from the five  governing parties, a civil servant and a police commander serves as a consultative body and a link to  politics. The patronage and support from the government (Melani) and organisations like Swiss  Police ICT is crucial for finding sponsors — which is vital since there is (almost) no financial support  from the patrons — and for the promotion of the challenge. However, Swiss Cyber Storm has  demonstrated that even without financial support from the government, it is possible to organise  and run such a challenge. Special thanks go to supporting companies like Aspectra, InfoGuard,  Kaspersky, Kudelsky Security, PwC, Swisscom, Symantec, terreActive, United Security Providers and  the two universities of applied sciences in Zurich and Bern. It is important to note that Swiss Cyber  Storm was inspired by the Cyber Security Austria team and has strong ties to it. It is also important  to note that, for 2015, there are ongoing negotiations with the Federal Department of Foreign  Affairs (EDA) to bring the challenge up to the next level by providing additional financial and  organisational support.  How the Cyber Security Challenge works  The challenge is split into three phases.  Phase 1 Registration and online qualification (14) May to September  Phase 2 Swiss national final 21–22 October  Phase 3 European Cyber Security Challenge 3—6 November  (12)  http://www.melani.admin.ch/index.html?lang=en  (13)  http://www.spik.ch/  (14)  Using https://www.hacking-lab.com/index.html  http://www.melani.admin.ch/index.html?lang=en http://www.spik.ch/ https://www.hacking-lab.com/index.html  Cybersecurity competitions — the status in Europe  October 2014  Page  10  Phase 1: Registration and online qualification  In the first phase, pupils and apprentices between 14 and 20 years old and ‘cyber talents’ between  20 and 30 years who do not (yet) have a master’s degree (15) can register for the Swiss Cyber Storm  qualification event on the Hacking Lab platform. Participants in this event have access to the security  challenges, which get unlocked on a monthly basis between May and September. By solving these  challenges, which include tasks from domains such as web application security, cryptography,  forensics, penetration testing or reverse engineering, they can collect points to improve their  ranking among the participants. Checking and rating the solutions submitted by the participants is  the most time-consuming and expensive task for the organiser. Since most challenges can be solved  in many different and sometimes unforeseen ways, the submissions must be checked and rated by  IT security experts. This expertise is also required because the solution does not only have to include  a description of the solution to the challenge (e.g. finding and exploiting a vulnerability in a web  application) but also a description of how to mitigate the problem.  Phase 2: Swiss national final  After the end of the qualification phase, the top 10 participants from each of the two categories  were invited to the Swiss national final on 21 and 22 October 2014 in Lucerne. On the first day, the  two teams for the next day’s final, consisting of five contestants from each of the two categories,  were formed. Team-building activities were planned and supervised by two experts. In the evening,  the contestants participated in the VIP event of the Swiss Cyber Storm IT security conference. During  this event, the contestants had the opportunity to talk to speakers, IT security professionals and  decision-makers to extend their network and to ask critical questions or to discuss fresh ideas and  viewpoints with the ‘establishment’. The awards ceremony of the Swiss Cyber Storm cybersecurity  challenge was held the next day during the closing session of the Swiss Cyber Storm IT security  conference running in parallel to the Swiss national final.  Phase 3: European Cyber Security Challenge  The winning team then represented Switzerland in the European Cyber Security Challenge from 3 to  5 November 2014 in Fürstenfeld. The finals took the form of a competition between teams from  Austria, Germany and Switzerland, who compete against each other in different live challenges. The  Swiss delegation consisted of the Swiss team and seven staff members from the Swiss Cyber Storm  association. After the challenge, the teams traveled to an awards ceremony on 6 November at the  Museum of Military History in Vienna, in the presence of politicians, economists and representatives  of government bodies.  Need for cybersecurity experts for public authorities and businesses  The protection of essential IT infrastructure is becoming increasingly important in both the public  and private sectors. The Swiss job market is desperately seeking highly qualified IT security experts  and to ensure this on a long-term basis talented young people who are enthusiastic about IT must be  encouraged from the earliest age possible, and trained to become the future IT security specialists  that the region needs. However, this is not easy because there are so many ‘cool’ opportunities in IT  which are much more visible to young talents than a career in IT security. To improve the odds, IT  security must be made more visible and tangible. Swiss Cyber Storm and its supporters are  convinced that an (inter)national IT security challenge is an important building block in achieving this  goal. With its supporters ranging from the Swiss Reporting and Analysis Centre for Information  Assurance (Melani) and the Swiss Police ICT association to sponsors from the private sector, Swiss  (15) For details see https://www.swisscyberstorm.com/securitychallenge/eligibility-requirements/  https://www.swisscyberstorm.com/securitychallenge/eligibility-requirements/  Cybersecurity competitions — the status in Europe  October 2014  Page  11  Cyber Storm is making sure that the interests and concerns of authorities and businesses are  respected and taken into account.  Preventing illegal activities  For most youngsters, learning how to hack systems is more appealing than learning how to protect  them. Through a direct and early approach to young people who are passionate about IT, Swiss  Cyber Storm wants to prevent them from using their knowledge, sooner or later, for illegal activities.  With the challenge, these youngsters not only get an opportunity to test their skills in a legal setting  but they are also encouraged to follow a legal path. Participants in the Swiss Cyber Storm Security  Challenge have to sign a code of ethics, where they confirm, in writing, that they have been  informed of the legal boundaries of hacking and that they are not allowed to use the techniques  they have learned for abusive purposes.  Cybersecurity competitions — the status in Europe  October 2014  Page  12  2.4 Romanian competition  There is one important rule though — hack before getting hacked!  DefCamp (D-CTF) in numbers  • In 3 years, four editions with teams of maximum five members  • Jeopardy, attack/defence and cyberattack scenarios  • 800 teams worldwide (75 % of the total number of teams competed in 2013)  How it all started  D-CTF was born in 2011 together with DefCamp, one of the most important conferences on hacking  and information security in central and eastern Europe. The goal was to bring about hands-on talks  about latest research and practices from the information and security field, gathering under the  same roof security specialists, entrepreneurs and academics, from both the private and public  sectors. But a simple conference was too easy and so they created D-CTF. The operation started in  2011 with around 10 teams and has registered about 800 teams worldwide to date (75 % of the total  number of teams competed in 2013).  Why D-CTF?  D-CTF says it’s all about teamwork, having one’s eyes wide open and possessing remarkable skills. It  spreads the newest security techniques and enables the security skills of the teams to be measured.  A complete team covering all the main skills is always the best option for getting into the finals.  At the same time the competition strengthens both technical and management skills; the leader  coordinates every step of the process, making sure that the team is following a line that will result in  capturing the flag. Mystery, mathematics and complicated algorithms combine to make everything  even more challenging. Some consider this competition to be a game, because originally it was a  game that simulates small team combat, based on defending an immobile flag while trying to  capture the flag of the other team.  Cybersecurity competitions — the status in Europe  October 2014  Page  13  Having the right team and knowing the right techniques to achieve the goal is most important. Of  course everything is doubled by:   effectiveness;   responsiveness;   team coordination.  How it works  D-CTF has two main parts: online qualification followed by a final challenge that usually happens  during DefCamp. The essentials regarding the online qualification are that the team leader registers  the team and it waits for the challenges to be sent on a specific day announced on the official  website. The team then has 48 hours to solve 25 problems in jeopardy style. The 10 teams that finish  all the challenges in time with the best results can enter the D-CTF finals that happen during  DefCamp. In the finals, the teams will have another 24 hours of challenges. The best teams will  receive prizes in the form of both cash and products worth thousands of euros.  Rules to follow:   Teams can have a  maximum of five members (including the team leader).   Denial of D-CTF service/servers is not allowed.   Finding bugs in D-CTF infrastructure can give the team more points.   The most important rule is though — hack before getting hacked!  Results:   48 hours of intensive work   Gaining knowledge   Simulating a live experiment   Facing challenges   Cash and/or an awesome experience  D-CTF says: ‘It’s an addictive competition that always manages to bring the strongest, [most] skilled  and [most] passionate teams that are at any time ready to take over the world, to face the  challenges and of course to take all the money — the cash prizes.’  Why D-CTF?  The Cyber Security Research Centre from Romania (CCSIR) (16) is a non-governmental organisation  with the sole purpose of promoting, supporting, implementing and coordinating security research in  the information security field in Romania, as well as international actions with short-, medium- and  long-term partnerships in the information security arena. ‘We are a team of passionate people with  a technical background,’ CCSIR says, ‘and now our main goal is to spread respect for cybersecurity  competitions worldwide.’  Organisation and support  ‘We struggle every year to get sponsors supporting our initiatives,’ CCSIR says. ‘In 2014 we’ve  created a special package in order to get a specific amount of money for D-CTF because we believe  that it’s the most important asset we have. Also because we have skilled people registering for this  (16)  http://ccsir.org/  http://ccsir.org/  Cybersecurity competitions — the status in Europe  October 2014  Page  14  competition and we want to reward and motivate them to further develop their skills and to keep  their eyes wide open for challenges. We put a lot of work every year into developing and spreading  the word about D-CTF and every year more and more companies are interested [in providing  support] either for hiring talent or to help the organisation to achieve the annual goal.’  The D-CTF success story  ‘It’s great to see talented teams going further after D-CTF finals,’ CCSIR adds. ‘Hexcellents, the 2012  and 2013 winning team from D-CTF, is the team that represents Romania in the largest CTF  competitions worldwide. Not only this, but [it] also ranked in the top 15 out of almost 1 000 teams  from all over the world. Also, one of our amazing challenges developer has won several international  competitions [and] he is now in one of the top five international teams for CTFs and he was recruited  by Facebook.’  The prizes  Cybersecurity competitions — the status in Europe  October 2014  Page  15  2.5 Spanish competition  CYBERCAMP17  The aim of Spanish CyberCamp is to promote cyberskills talent of our future professionals in  cybersecurity by running advanced challenges and competitions for best spanish students and  researchers in cybersecurity as well as best international talented professionals.  CyberCamp is sponsored by the government through the Confidence Plan18 of the Digital Agenda of  Spain19.  The first edition has an online qualifying phase during October-November 2014 and the physical  event takes place during a weekend on 5-7 December in Madrid.  The physical event is a great opportunity to share experiences among the different participants and  to create a better link between the top talents or best projects to the industry recruiters or  investors’ interests respectively.  • Incentives and prices for the best contesters: networking, entertainment, recruiting, grants,  attractive training and travelling to international events;  • Challenges: top talents from previous online phase are invited to the event to compete at  CyberCamp (CTF- Blue Team/Red Team contest).

Cybercamp is open to scientific, university, company, online communities or  students who want to use it as a platform to disseminate their projects.  Currently, there is a contact network with international universities, public and private institutions in  the field of science, innovation and entrepreneurship that we will consider accordingly. Likewise,  many online communities and youth associations that support dissemination of Cybersecurity  activities.  All this makes a comprehensive approach so that CyberCamp can consider the different needs to be  met before and during the Event.  In addition, partners and potential sponsors are supported in a specific communication strategy. It  gives opportunity to brand visibility and improving corporate image. Clear objectives are being  defined to align the audience Cybercamp and interested brands.  Interactive support platform  CyberCamp wishes to broadcast the event activities and encourage conversation among attendees.  The platform will be a place to collect all content, materials and discussions that occur during the  event.  The platform is designed exclusively to meet the needs that can generate the call for a challenge,  both locally and globally. It allows users to register on the challenges that interest them and can  upload their projects and provide all necessary documentation. It bridges talent, companies and  institutions to create value and contribute to innovative solutions and ideas.  The platform may also collect data to participate in itineraries such as \"the best entrepreneur\"  contest. The information received will be considered for selection, evaluation and development of  participants to raise Cybersecurity talent in Spain.  The cyber security challenge is split in two phases:  Phase 1 Online Challenge - Registration and online  qualification www.cybercamp.es  October  Phase 2 Insitu Challenge - Spanish national final 6-7 December  Phase 1: Online Challenge - Registration and online Qualification  CyberCamp.es portal was open for registration from September.  It  allowed the users to assess their skills during a first qualification phase. Different categories were  released every week in October for the contest. After that, the challenges remained active as a  playground outside the contest. Quick responses were rated higher for each of the challenges and  bonus decrease over time. The first to answer correctly has 200% value of its original score, the  second answer has 150%, the third 125% rating and, after that, correct answers are valued at 100%.  Type of online challenges:   System Vulnerabilities: related with virtual images analysis and vulnerable configurations.   Reversing: related to Analysis of malware and APKs.   Forensics: Memory Dumps and USB / HD disk.  http://www.cybercamp.es/  Cybersecurity competitions — the status in Europe  October 2014  Page  17   Code Analysis: source code review for potential vulnerabilities   Web Vulnerabilities: attacks to websites.   Cryptography: Analysis of Steganography and ciphering.  Phase 2: In situ Challenge - Spanish national final  It is held in Madrid during Cybercamp Event on 5-7 December. The final phase of the challenge is the  so-called “Insitu Challenge”. It refers to a fortified platform for cybersecurity challenges as a  controlled security laboratory.  A platform allows the assessment of expertise and users reaction in an unknown environment. The  challenges will be available in Spanish and English with an educational focus and the aim is to  develop their technical skills. The simulation environment is similar to a real case where participants  use their own desktop equipment to perform quizzes. The platform has a web interface that allows  access from the most common operating systems.  The design allows the grouping of tests in the following categories or phases:   Recognition: Phase where participants test their ability to detect vulnerabilities in exposed  environments.   Raid: This phase offer systems to try to access them.   Discovery: In this phase is focused on the internal network infrastructure system that was  attacked.   Capture: this phase evidences guide the participant to gain control over critical systems in  the attacked environment.   Exfiltration: During this last phase, the participant obtains critical system information and  take it to its computer.  The estimated challenge duration is 6 hours. We are selecting the number of suitable tests, duration  of each test with certain specifications, test complexity, dependencies between tests, objectives to  be achieved and other design elements.  Cybersecurity competitions — the status in Europe  October 2014  Page  18  2.6 United Kingdom competition  Cyber Security Challenge UK Ltd is a not-for-profit company formed in March 2010 to plug the  cybersecurity skills gap in the UK. About 90 % of professionals surveyed had difficulties recruiting the  cybersecurity talent needed by their companies, across all eight categories of cybersecurity jobs  surveyed. Nearly 60 % predicted (correctly) an increase in the number of jobs there would be in the  British market in cybersecurity. The mission of the Cyber Security Challenge is to ensure that  sufficient numbers of those, of any age, with a talent for cybersecurity are identified, inspired and  enabled to find training and fill such jobs as are needed to provide efficient protection of the United  Kingdom’s economic prosperity, national security and chosen way of life. The company runs on  sponsorship from the government, the private sector and academia, all of which recognise the  national importance of cybersecurity, not just for national security reasons or to allow citizens to  safely choose to take actions using digital means but also to underpin the economy and enable the  market growth needed for the United Kingdom’s future prosperity and success. Cyber Security  Challenge is a unique programme of activities designed to introduce sufficient numbers of talented  people to learning and career opportunities in the cybersecurity profession.  At the heart of this is the national competition programme but a growing schools  programme, learning opportunities at cybercamps and networking initiatives are  all linked together to identify, inspire, inform and enable more EU citizens  resident in the UK to become cybersecurity professionals.  Only those not currently working in cybersecurity are eligible to compete in these competitions.  Previous winners have ranged from a postman who now works for Royal Mail as a vulnerability  manager to a university undergraduate also now employed in a cybersecurity profession.  Cybersecurity skills shortages are a problem in many countries. In line with British government  support for international collaboration on cybersecurity issues, the Cyber Security Challenge  welcomes partnerships with other organisations which do similar work in Europe or elsewhere. Its  sponsors are often multinational and there is interest amongst them in supporting competitions run  in other countries and in getting value from the potential public relations opportunities and benefits  of such competitions. This could be by many countries playing the same competition or a play-off  between teams from different countries. An objective in Cyber Security Challenge UK’s business plan  for 2014 is ‘to forge partnerships with other competition runners to link to more people interested  in cybersecurity and encourage our candidates to experience other competitions’.  Competition programme  The initial concept was to identify talent through a range of virtual competitions (to reach large  numbers), then to meet the most talented at face-to-face sessions and finally to enable them to get  jobs, through giving them prizes that provide training and networking opportunities.  Cybersecurity competitions — the status in Europe  October 2014  Page  19  The company was registered in March 2010, launched in April and started its first three competitions  in July. Only one, designed by QinetiQ, was a new competition: Sans Institute provided a challenge it  had used in the United States. The US Department of Defence allowed Cyber Security Challenge UK  to be a strand of its international digital forensics competition. Each of the three competitions dealt  with a different subject within cybersecurity and the winners flowed through to one of two face-to- face competitions and then a masterclass final. Within 3 weeks 4 000 people had registered to play.  Cyber Security Challenge UK now runs many more competitions but sponsors continue to supply all  of them as part of their sponsorship contribution. The Cyber Security Challenge team moderates for  quality and fairness and ensures competitions are testing the skills that businesses and government  need. It manages the marking of face-to-face competitions with the help of sponsors from different  companies who observe candidates’ performance, scoring them on a matrix of skills and  competencies. The types of competitions run have tested defensive skills, knowledge of different  vectors of attack, digital forensics, policy and procedures and more.  The virtual nature of the first games allows large numbers to play but only 100–200 are successful in  reaching the face-to-face stage and this year there were 40 at the masterclass final. Some candidates  do not make it to the final as they get jobs in cybersecurity, rendering them ineligible. Cyber Security  Challenge UK has built on the success of its first year and developed year by year. There are now  about seven virtual challenges annually. Its most recent virtual competition, written by Sophos, had  over 600 registrations. Then there are about four face-to-face challenges, with some 30 candidates  in each. The plan for this year is to establish a play-on-demand platform which will allow candidates  to play at different times and should increase the breadth of the company’s reach. In addition it runs  ad hoc competitions like a Christmas cipher which had some 1 500 entrants.  Virtual competitions focused on skills needed  Finalists meet face to face  Development, training and further challenges  Identify talent — pull through to courses and jobs  Enable careers through prizes such as private sector  training courses, networking opportunities and  payment of university fees  Clarify what  cybersecurity  jobs are, why  they are fun  and what the  career options  are  Cybersecurity competitions — the status in Europe  October 2014  Page  20  Technical competence is the key component but at the face-to-face stage interpersonal skills are  also tested. The masterclass winner, the cybersecurity champion of the United Kingdom, will be  strong in both technical and interpersonal skills. There is not just one winner and a runner-up  though. The prize portfolio (all donations of training or networking opportunities from companies,  government or universities) is worth about GBP 100 000 so a lot of candidates benefit and get the lift  they need to make a successful start in a career in cybersecurity. Candidates in each masterclass are  marked both for their individual performance and as part of a team.  The last masterclass had teams being the front-line defenders in dealing with a series of attacks. In  the course of a day and a half the attacks emerged as being not just criminal but nationally critical,  bringing down national infrastructure. The teams had to identify what was happening technically,  find ways to stop the attacks and also brief the press and government. This competition was written  by BT, GCHQ, the National Crime Agency and Juniper Networks. Candidates had an exhausting but  exhilarating time, learning much along the way. The markers came from about 20 different sponsor  companies.  For the first time all the competitions in this year’s annual programme are linked  around a single theme. This is to raise excitement and fun as the programme develops and give a  feeling of progress as the story unfolds. The last masterclass awards ceremony was interrupted by a  video from a masked group calling themselves the Flag Day Associates whose terrifying messages  warned of future attacks on the United Kingdom. Following this, the challenge announced that the  investigation of, and defence against, the threat posed by the Flag Day Associates will be undertaken  by the challenge’s candidates. In order to best defend the United Kingdom from this threat, the  competition programme over the coming months will serve to both find out more information about  this mysterious organisation, and identify the skills and expertise required to protect against it.  Issues and candidate stakeholder groups. Knowledge of training and jobs  Cyber Security Challenge UK says that one first year surprise was that most of the candidates (who  by definition were interested in cybersecurity) stated in a questionnaire that they knew little or  nothing about cybersecurity careers and training opportunities. However 84 % were interested in  being introduced to potential employers. Most were competing to demonstrate their skills, not to  find a job. But by the end of the year 87 % said they were more likely to consider a job in  cybersecurity and over 90 % thought they had learned more about cybersecurity jobs and developed  their skills. ‘In retrospect it is not surprising that people are not knowledgeable about cybersecurity  jobs which are quite new and totally different from the security jobs of a decade ago,' the company  says. ‘In addition our education system has not yet grown to include cybersecurity within the  curriculum at schools.’  We realised that we needed to do more than spot available talent, it is necessary  to develop a whole pipeline of people for the future.  In response to the need to provide information about jobs, the company is continuing to develop the  opportunities for candidates to network with employers, especially its sponsors, attend  cybersecurity events, run cyberfairs and build the provision of careers and training information on its  website. Candidates have found that meeting sponsors has been important and has brought the jobs  to life for them. To build the pipeline for the future the company is engaging with different  stakeholder groups from those at school or university to those already employed, but not in  cybersecurity.  Cybersecurity competitions — the status in Europe  October 2014  Page  21  One candidate recruited by a PwC threat and vulnerability team commented: ‘The challenge helped  me to meet employers who could see what I could do.’  Development  All competitions give some opportunity for development and learning. Cyber Security Challenge UK  says it welcomes the fact that candidates can research answers for some of the virtual competitions.  It is working to grow the opportunities to develop and learn and is establishing a more structured  sort of cybercamp. It has already run cybercamps hosted by universities and by the UK Ministry of  Defence and in 2014 is running two cybercamps with a new design aimed at those who know they  want to follow a cybersecurity career. These will pilot a structured programme of learning and  competitions and those who reach the required standard will qualify to take a government- recognised qualification, to equip them for jobs. Introductory training materials will also be provided  online to equip more people to compete.  Diversity  Only 8 % of year one candidates were female and only 4 % of year two. There have never been more  than two women at a masterclass. The United Kingdom is keen to recruit from the whole population  and it is a government objective to draw more women into technical jobs. Cyber Security Challenge  UK is working with partners like Stemnet to maximise impact and has launched a number of  initiatives designed to involve more women in competitions. These range from showing successful  women as role models in video clips about jobs on the website to reshaping some of the marketing  materials and running an event to draw in the support of the current female cybersecurity  community. The latter took place at Bletchley Park and some of the original female code-breakers  attended. Their role in successful wartime code-breaking is only now being recognised. The Times  newspaper reported this message from one of the original code-breakers, Ruth Bourne, now aged  87: ‘It is all about brains, brains, brains … Don’t be put off by the mathematical suggestions. If I could  be trained to operate one of those machines as a kid … you could do it now in spades.’  Schools  Cyber Security Challenge UK says it wants to reach anyone of any age who might have the talent to  do well in cybersecurity. Each year the standard of its candidates has got higher. ‘This has been good  for employers wishing to recruit but it has meant that few schoolchildren reach the face-to-face  stage of our competitions and we want to avoid discouraging them. In response to this a schools  programme was launched last year initially reaching over 500 schools. This is growing and in 2014/15  will reach classes of about 30 in over 1 000 schools.’ The programme has two strands — firstly, a  teacher pack giving a lesson plan keyed to the small relevant items in the national curriculum and a  number of exercises designed by sponsors, and secondly, a competition, focused this year on coding.  The six best schools in the coding competition competed in a face-to-face final which demonstrated  the physical impacts of cybersecurity — carrying out, for example, actions to move a robot. The  enthusiasm generated has been encouraging and school groups have participated in some of the  networking events involving key people in cybersecurity. The government is seeking to introduce  some cybersecurity into the curriculum and Cyber Security Challenge UK says it will develop its  programme to link into this and continue to support teachers. ‘We are working with one of our  sponsors, Northrop Grumman, to introduce the Cyber Centurion programme to the United Kingdom  (Cyber Patriot in the United States). This will plug the gap between our schools programme and the  national competition programme, drawing students through from one to the other.’  Universities  Cyber Security Challenge UK is working with some universities which are developing their own  competitions and playing against other universities. The company would like to further develop its  Cybersecurity competitions — the status in Europe  October 2014  Page  22  work with universities (perhaps through university interest groups to foster enthusiasm for jobs and  cybersecurity as a subject), run university competitions and draw good candidates through to the  national competition programme. Cybersecurity skills may be found not only amongst those taking  IT or computer studies but a wide variety of other subjects. Cybersecurity is becoming a life skill  needed by all and we would like to encourage modules on cybersecurity in a number of subjects, the  more obvious being engineering and business studies.  People already in employment  Those already in jobs but lacking the means to prove their competence and transition to cyberjobs  are low-hanging fruit for those looking to recruit. They may prove to be the group which will benefit  most from the learning opportunities that the new cybercamps will provide (see above).  Alumni  Cyber Security Challenge UK has a database of around 11 000 individuals interested in cybersecurity  and successful candidates become members of an alumni group. This group supports the company  in a number of ways, including providing outreach to new communities, informing its activities and  sometimes helping with the running of competitions.  Sponsors: why do they offer support?  Private sector sponsors are attracted firstly because they recognise the skills shortage in  cybersecurity. They see this as a problem that will impact on their businesses and that they cannot  rectify alone. So corporate social responsibility is a starting block: beyond this, they look to benefit in  different ways from their partnership with the challenge, reaching agreements that give different  benefits to both parties. The main benefits to companies are: recruitment opportunities; PR  marketing and publicity, showing the company’s excellence in cybersecurity; networking  opportunities through meeting senior staff from other companies — including through the  competition — government and academia; opportunities to display thought leadership; a way to  demonstrate support of the government strategy; and showcasing training provision. The main  benefits to the challenge are a balance of finance to run the business and value in kind, which varies  from developing and running a competition to hosting the  Cyber Security Challenge UK website or  hosting one of its networking events. The platinum sponsors form an advisory board that advises the  Cyber Security Challenge Board on the development of the business.  Government sponsors the challenge for many of the same reasons as the private sector. It recruits  from amongst its candidates. The British government’s cybersecurity strategy has a strong emphasis  on developing cybersecurity skills and capability and names Cyber Security Challenge as one of the  ways of helping to fill the cybersecurity skills gap. It also recognises that its activities support other  government cyberobjectives like raising security awareness.  Academia is developing more courses that include or are centred on cybersecurity and is working  with business and government. Academics have also welcomed links to their local business  communities.  ‘SMEs are under attack from hackers, but where do you go to ensure that you are more secure?  There is a massive shortage of new recruits to the cybermarket. The potential recruits are there, and  often in unrelated roles such as heating engineers and postmen. The challenge is to find them, train  them and bring them into the cyber workplace. By sponsoring the Cyber Security Challenge you can  ensure that such potential recruits are identified and given a chance. In this way you help to fill the  cyberskills gap and ensure that there is expertise available that can protect you and your  organisation.’ Tony McDowell — Encryption  Cybersecurity competitions — the status in Europe  October 2014  Page  23  2.7 Other type of private platforms: Symantec Cyber Readiness Challenge  The Symantec Cyber Readiness Challenge is a cyberexercise platform designed to educate and  inform IT security professionals as well as common IT users through exciting, informative and  immersive user experiences in real-world, challenging events. The goal is to allow participants to test  their security knowledge in a safe educational environment, and to apply their learning in their daily  jobs to protect their people and information.  The challenge is a live penetration simulation, inspired by real-life security issues to help  organisations understand the vulnerabilities in today’s global threat landscape and ultimately gain  critical security intelligence to improve their skills, knowledge and security posture. It is designed for  all levels of technical expertise. It puts participants in the role of a penetration tester trying to  understand the attackers’ targets, technology and thought processes so they can ultimately better  protect their own organisation.  This interactive ‘capture-the-flag’-style competition is built along Symantec’s five stages of a typical  cyber breach (reconnaissance, incursion, discovery, capture and exfiltration) and leverages  Symantec’s leading-edge security intelligence. The exercise gives participants the opportunity to test  their abilities within a unique and realistic environment and, in particular, to sharpen their security  skills, expand their security awareness, implement their theoretical knowledge and compete against  peers, all in a sandboxed environment.  There are a number of variations in how the exercise can be conducted, with the shortest scenario  lasting no more than 2 hours, and the longest lasting for 4 to 5 full days. The level of detail of the  corresponding scenarios varies accordingly, involving a variety of events and practices common to  many cyberincidents and attacks. These may range from traditional penetration testing through the  exploitation of lost and found devices all the way to full-scale industrial espionage operations  involving intrusion and privilege escalation into IT systems, as well as the stealthy infiltration and  maintenance of advanced persistent threats.  This several-hour immersion, accessible for all IT skill levels, allows each participant to develop their  understanding of how security breaches can happen. The self-paced learning environment setting  tasks of varying difficulty and the guided gameplay set-up supported by a hinting system create an  ideal setting for participants to put their theoretical knowledge into practice in a safe environment,  learn how an attacker thinks, experience how systems are compromised, and asses their security  posture through a new lens. Each participant will be issued with a Continuous Professional Education  (CPE) Verification of Attendance that may be used to attest the completion of training assignments  or requirements. They will also receive individual performance reports based on how far and how  quickly they have progressed through the chosen scenario. After its development and pilot testing  phases completed in the course of 2012–13, the Symantec Cyber Readiness Challenge platform is  now established so as to be able to support multiple different scenarios across the Europe–Middle  East–Africa (EMEA) region. It can be accessed in multiple ways, remotely via a VPN connection or in  person, or even both simultaneously. Leveraging Symantec’s deep security knowledge to replicate  realistic situations, the platform is designed to educate and challenge participants of all technical  abilities with individual feedback. Depending on participants’ requirements, the platform is able to  support the co-development of further tailored scenarios.  Exercises using this platform can be run simultaneously in different locations, accommodating up to  1 000 participants, and they are underpinned by continuous remote IT support from Symantec  throughout the challenge. Additional features include the option of webcasting the start of the  exercise. The platform is purposely designed to be accessible even by users with only modest or  average IT equipment. The minimum technical requirements for network connectivity and for  Cybersecurity competitions — the status in Europe  October 2014  Page  24  participants’ machines are so designed as to accommodate most commonly used hardware and  software configurations without any difficulty. Even laptops that are several years old may be used,  as long as the VPN software used for the exercise and the latest version of Java can be installed on  them, and provided that sufficient network connectivity is available.  The platform was tested successfully in October 2013 with ENISA across different EU Member  States, using a specific scenario relevant to the participating EU institutions. This fruitful experience  is now available for replication (20) in 2014.  3. How to organise a challenge  ‘Hacker contest’ or more?: an Austrian perspective.  Our society is filled with digital lifelines — growing with a terrifying speed and density, which we can  only partly comprehend. For information technology, the limited space in the datacentre has  become far too cramped and ‘IT’ surrounds us in our everyday life much more than we like to  accept. Luckily people are also developing, slowly but surely, a certain awareness that these great  opportunities also include plenty of risks for everybody. This topic has been given a lot of attention  at security conferences. The ‘human’ factor is above all when it comes to potential risk in  combination with most risk management systems, be it as user or offender. In addition, the  availability of sufficient qualified personnel or ‘human capital’ receives plenty of attention.  The ‘war for talents’ — also known as the battle for high achievers — is not a real innovation. Many  educational institutions orientate their portfolios to the demands of ‘information and security  experts’. Considering this development, the question arises of the extent to which ‘hacker contests’  are not just circus acts. Do the operating ‘nerds’ have a legal exhibition on the border of the law?  These ‘outsiders’, with no apparent rules and their own culture, can have a moment of public glory.  Prejudices [against them] have been established due to one-sided and wrong news coverage. Are  they ready to take a step into the spotlight? There are legimate reasons to think about all these  questions (which are mainly due to stereotypes), but they are concealing more important facts.  When officers of the federal criminal police in lower Austria managed in April 2012 to arrest the  ‘hacker’ with the nickname ‘ACK13STX’, who had hacked several hundred companies in the period  from January to March of that year, they were pretty impressed to discover that the criminal was  only 15 years old. They were similar surprised by his reasoning. He said he was bored, wanted  attention and media coverage about ‘hacker’ attacks — similar to those from Anonymous. These and  comparable motives can be found in the statements of many other young ‘hackers’.  This youthful need for admiration encounters unchallenged and irresponsible media-hyped demand.  A search on Google for ‘16 year old hacker’ yielded more than 57 000 results. This very case  convinced the board of Cyber Security Austria to concentrate more on the topic of ‘up-and-coming  hackers’. It quickly became clear that there was a lack of consciousness of, and consequently missing  opportunities and structures for, talented young people. This leads them to feel left alone with their  skills, maybe stigmatised or, at best, slightly smiled at. In most cases, they just feel misunderstood by  their environment. It’s no wonder that many of them seek attention on different paths, and search  online for people similar to themselves.  The consequences for society are crucial and far more extensive than had been expected. It is  comparable to the missing awareness and structures in athletic sports that could lead to losing out  (20) Interested organisations are invited to contact Symantec’s Brussels office to discuss terms and conditions, technical requirements,  scheduling options, scenario planning and logistical arrangements: Mr Ilias Chantzos Tel. , Global Critical Infrastructure Protection  and Privacy Advisor, Senior Director Government Affairs, EMEA Symantec, Medialaan 38, 1800 Vilvoorde, Belgium, e-mail  ilias_chantzos@symantec.com  mailto:ilias_chantzos@symantec.com  Cybersecurity competitions — the status in Europe  October 2014  Page  25  on a potential 8 seconds runner for the 100-metre sprint. That the opposite is also possible can be  seen from Austria’s dominance in winter sports. Professional structures were built at all levels at a  very early stage, which led to a strict and hard selection process but enabled Austria to rank as one  of the top nations in these sports. IT, and knowledge around its safe and secure use, is not yet  acknowledged in public consciousness as a sport like skiing, but we know that we are much more  reliant on IT than on the more popular winter sports. However, the comparison is perfect to  illustrate the topic and intentions of the Cyber Security Challenge. The challenge is aimed at  becoming the spearhead for sustainable structures that enable society to recognise young people  who possess the necessary talent and interest. These ‘rising stars’ can then be encouraged and  invested in, for as long as ordinary schooling cannot support these structures.  A European cybersecurity challenge should accomplish an array of functions.  For young people with a special set of skills:   the possibility to prove those special skills;   the possibility to compare themselves with peers (benchmarking);   as a focal point and stage for young people and as a ‘positive’ network, where specialists  from theory, science and business can communicate;   as an awareness and appreciation platform to get rid of stigmas — the challenge should  also prove the environment of the participants how useful and important those skills  are;   to realise their skills and how they can use these in a responsible and ethical way;   to adapt to their abilities and communicate them in a customised environment;   to get excellent perspectives from an economic, commercial and social point of view;  For business and public authorities:   the chance to identify, encourage and develop young talents, build up a pool of talents and  encourage their selective growth;   the availability of highly qualified trainees;   the possibility to position themselves positively for those young talents, which otherwise  cannot be reached via the classic job market;   proof of performance for local talents (benchmarking), with the results of the challenge  allowing detailed comparisons;   ‘fingerprinting’ to get a clear picture of the qualifications of youth in the area of computer  security, more specifically the skills to intrude a computer system;   realising available capacities;   an event analogous to other large sporting event (Olympic Games or World Cups) to create a  specific awareness and to enthuse young people about information technology;  Cybersecurity competitions — the status in Europe  October 2014  Page  26  For schools, universities of applied science, other universities and educational institutions:   to position themselves as educational platforms for talented students;   to proof the performance level of their own pupils or students;   to get more young people interested in computer security — to create an awareness of  the topic of security;   to draw conclusions regarding education, science and theory.  The challenge is also beneficial for the media and society, giving them, for example, the rare chance  to get a ‘hacker’ live in action. The challenge also shows that although ‘hackers’ may have a  mysterious and forbidding aura, they are just ordinary people with a special set of skills. These skills  are not only about misuse for criminal activities, contrary to what the majority of the population  thinks.  This is why it is important not to compare all ‘hackers’ with offenders. ‘Hackers’ have a special ability  to think beyond the boundaries of existing systems. Therefore, they use not referred properties and  functions made by the ‘designer’, to utilise different purposes. With this they show that the  functionality of systems always depends on the will and intention of the user. The intention that  people have to adapt to the technical systems is doomed on the long run. The ones to survive on the  long-term are those which are accepted and find a reasonable benefit.  To sum up we would add several general considerations.   It makes sense to coordinate a European challenge with local partners — otherwise the  overheads for running a European Cyber Security Challenge (ECSC) might become inefficient.   ENISA should provide support in the form of clear guidelines, a European corporate identity,  know-how, suggestions, White Papers and, if possible, resources (personnel and money) and  a clear goal — about what is expected.   The ECSC could be just a ‘free’ European comparison between different countries — but it  probably makes sense to have a closer look at other successful ‘working’ European  challenges — like the UEFA Champions League, for example. The winner of a national  competition qualifies to participate in the Champions League — where the ‘rules of the  game’ are equal and the same for all participating soccer clubs in Europe — which makes it  comparable! This comparability is an important element in the basic idea of competition, on  the one hand, and on the other hand it makes the challenge more attractive for the  Economy to support this challenge and find highly talented young people.   The regional approach deployed of Austria, Germany and Switzerland may provide an  example.   It make sense to coordinate the local competition between one or several public institutions,  schools and universities, companies and associations. The combination of different  stakeholders might also be a very important factor in organising this local challenge —  because this combination provides the best coverage of potential pupils and students as well  as all other supporting stakeholders. But probably it makes sense also to discuss a European  prequalification which might be assisted and organised by the local players. It is not  important what kind of solutions — such as ‘capture the flag’ or equal or open exercises like  Cybersecurity competitions — the status in Europe  October 2014  Page  27  ‘hacking labs’ — are used in the local competitions or qualifications, as long as there is  transparency about what systems might be used at the finals in a European challenge. But  there are some advantages in running an equal system in the local (pre)qualification  competitions as well.   Because there are different school systems in different European countries, it makes more  sense to divide potential participants groups by age e.g.probably 14–18, 18–30 years etc.   ENISA should encourage the local organisers to run an additional programme — called a  centre of excellence (CoE) or some other name — which supports the young talents with  different services, exercises, excursions and other ‘tokens’ to enforce the network between  them, as well the network between them and the economy, public institutions and the  education sector.  4. Guidelines for a pan-European cyberchallenge competition  In this chapter we unfold the considerations in organising a pan-European cyberchallenge  competition for students, from general information to some specifics steps foward.  The goal is to promote cyberchallenges as a focal point for:   awareness of the need for cybersecurity and threat intelligence;   benchmarking for young people, in schools or universities, and among lifelong learners;   the early discovery of young people with a talent for IT security;   understanding of the range and diversity of jobs in cyber security;   the development of structures to sustain IT security excellence in the education sector;   the attraction of IT and IT security for young people;   national and European networks of excellence and establishing professional IT security  excellence in Europe.  Target audience  The audience is made up of two levels, firstly policymakers who have the decision-making power and  influence to lead their societies towards progress and new technologies, with citizens with high ICT  skills, and, secondly, digital users, primarily students, who may get involved and develop IT  expertise. Some of the advantages that we envisage are:   the early discovery of young people with a talent for IT security;   the fingerprinting of IT security skills of pupils and students;   the additional promotion and training of skills (through centres of excellence);   the professional development of young people with high potential;   fostering of networking between themselves and peer-to-peer education;   the provision of a clear signal to the social environment of young ‘hackers’ — we need this  know-how!;   deploy a legal environment, where skills can be developed and links made with those in  cyber security jobs, to inspire and divert to socially useful jobs those who might otherwise  be attracted to criminality;  Cybersecurity competitions — the status in Europe  October 2014  Page  28   making them understand their potential and opportunities as well as their social  responsibility.  Cybersecurity competitions — the status in Europe  October 2014  Page  29  Context  Furthermore, after the exchange of information from the workshop organised in April, we have  noted the following points.   There are several well-established competitions in Europe and we should take their  experiences into account.   Private organisations have developed different platforms that can be a good starting point  for the pan-European platform.   A future pan-European security challenge will be developed as follows.  a. Based on the EU cybersecurity strategy, the first target audience will be university  students and therefore the focus for the 2015 cyberchallenge will be on universities.  b. In 2015, this publicly available report is the first document with guidelines for  organising a pan-European challenge.  c. In 2015, the language of the competition will be English , and if further funding  becomes available French and German will be added.  d. The Cyber Challenge Organising Committee is going to launch several calls,  including:   a call for platform providers;   a call for general involvement;   a call for sponsors.  e. The European Cyber Challenge Competition will be organised in the fourth quarter  of 2015.  Cybersecurity competitions — the status in Europe  October 2014  Page  30  5. Conclusions  With this report,  a milestone in this challenging initiative has been reached. We have identified the  experienced players in European countries, established contact, organised the first workshop in  Brussels, and published a common document as result of a highly collaborative process during 2014.  The stage is set for an ambitious deployment of the pan-European Cyber Security  Challenge Competition!  Furthermore, we would like to underline the importance of the European Commission’s active  involvement in getting on board policymakers in the Member States, the expertise of the EU’s  cybersecurity agency, ENISA,  in involving the best experts in the field and the responsibility of public  and private stakeholder in understanding that the target is set very high and that they should engage  to the best of their ability.  The European Cyber Security Challenge Competition is set to be the result of a  public–private partnership with capable players and focused to change for the  better the ICT educational approach that digital citizens in Europe receive.

Introduction  This report focuses on the status of cyber challenge competitions in Europe and their  implementation. The European Commission’s joint communication to the European Parliament, the  Council, the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions  ‘Cybersecurity strategy of the European Union: an open, safe and secure cyberspace’ (1) suggests  that the Commission  organise, with the support of ENISA, a cybersecurity championship  where university students will compete in proposing network and information security (NIS)  solutions. In order to help develop the planning for this Europe-wide endeavour, this report provides  information on current national efforts that can be used as the starting point for the pan European  challenge.  Goal  The aim of this report is to provide up-to-date information about current cyberchallenge  competitions taking place in Europe. The experiences of all the Member State will be considered  later on, when establishing the general framework for the development of a pan-European  competition for students.  Target audience  The primary audience for this report is national experts already involved in, or interested in,  cyberchallenge competitions. However, the information within it will also be useful for a broader  public including policymakers and NIS educators .  Structure  This report provides a general overview of existing cyberchallenge competitions in Member States,  as well as a roadmap for a future pan-European cyberchallenge competition. The first part presents  the experience of five countries. The second part comprises of a short ‘how to’ guide containing the  steps in organising a challenge. The third part goes into more detail on concrete developments  concerning a pan-European challenge. The fourth and final part contains several recommendations  that should be taken into account.

Presentation of existing cyberchallenge competitions in Europe  This chapter presents existing competitions and their results. Some basic information is contained in  the table below.  Organiser Name of the  challenge  Date Periodicity  Austria Austrian Cyber  Security Challenge  From May 2014 to November  2014  Annual  Switzerland Swiss Cyber Storm  From May 2014 to  November  2014  Romania D-CTF  From October 2014 to  November 2014  Spain Spanish CyberCamp  From October 2014 to  December 2014  United  Kingdom  Cyber Security  Challenge  All year  About Cyber Security Austria (3)  ‘Cyber Security Austria — Association to promote the safety of Austrian strategic infrastructure’ is a  non-profit, independent and non-party organisation, whose goal is to sponsor and promote security  awareness in Austria and to encourage the IT security of strategic infrastructure.The honorary  members of the association want, in particular, to collect, link, facilitate and publish existing  competencies.  About Swiss Cyber Storm (4)  The message is ‘ Meet the future talent’.  Swiss Cyber Storm, founded on 15 November 2012, is a non-profit organisation that conducts the  Swiss Cyber Storm IT security conferences and cybersecurity challenges. It organises the annual  Cyber Security Challenge, whose 2014 edition will be the largest contest in the search for  Switzerland’s most promising young cybersecurity talents, to promote their abilities and to convince  them to pursue a career in cybersecurity.  About Defcamp Romania (5)  Defcamp Capture the Flag (D-CTF) is an innovative and ground-breaking security capture-the-flag  (CTF) competition in central and eastern Europe. The most skilful hackers and IT geeks put their  knowledge to the test and try to get into the ‘best of the best’ top five, in the hope that they can win  the overall event or ‘die trying’. There is one important rule — hack before getting hacked!  (3) Further information at http://www.cybersecurity.at (currently only in German).

It is a cybersecurity challenge for best spanish students and researchers in cybersecurity as well as  best international talented professionals by different competitions and advanced challenges  designed by INTECO and several stakeholders. The event will allow the industry participation by  presenting success cases.  The event (which first edition is scheduled from October to December 2014), include online  challenges, training labs, CTF, wargames, hackathons as well as tracks to foster enterpreneurship in  Cybersecurity with speed dating slots with investors.  In its first edition, the physical event will take place in December between 5th and 7th in Madrid.  About Cyber Security Challenge UK (7)  Cyber Security Challenge UK Ltd is a not-for-profit company, formed in March 2010, to plug the  cybersecurity skills gap in the United Kingdom. Some 90 % of professionals surveyed had difficulties  in recruiting the cybersecurity talent needed by their companies, across all eight categories of  cybersecurity jobs. Nearly 60 % predicted (correctly) an increase in the number of jobs in the UK  cybersecurity market.  2.1 Workshop in April 2014  As a first step to kick off the work (8), ENISA opened a public call and invited stakeholders to a  common meeting. A workshop on ‘Cybersecurity challenges in Europe’ was organised on 29 April in  Brussels. The main goal was to look at what is being done in the area of cybersecurity and how this  could be coordinated. The talks, which lasted for half a day, covered a large range of initiatives  throughout Europe for identifying (mostly young) people with a talent for advanced activities in  cybersecurity — and for recruiting them to work in this area. Speakers gave an overview of activities  including hackathons, red team/blue team and CTF games, SWOT analyses and speed dating. In  addition to these more competitive styles, more standard university-level courses were described.  Speed dating and forms of mentoring are two of the ways in which participants can enter into  contact with professionals in the field, a factor that was recognised by many speakers as being  extremely conducive to the success of the activities.  In Sections 2.2 to 2.7, the competitions presented at the workshop will be described in detail. The  remainder of Section 2.1 contains additional observations and conclusions from the workshop.  All these activities focus on people who are suited to being security experts — but the actions (or  non-actions) of non-expert computer or data users also determine security and privacy outcomes.  This was the specific topic of a presentation at the workshop on the classification of security types,  which outlined how too much attention is currently being paid to perimeter security — which means  that once an attacker has gained access to the area inside the perimeter (premises, the computer  system, etc.), there is a lot of potential damage, because management control, operational controls  and internal security measures are often lacking. Interestingly, according to the presentation, this is  very different in other security fields such as chemical, biological and nuclear security. It was pointed  (6)  Further information will be available at Website: http://cybercamp.es  (publicly available from September 2014)  (7) Further information at http://cybersecuritychallenge.org.uk/  (8) Rapporteur Bettina Berendt, KU Leuven, Belgium (http://people.cs.kuleuven.be/~bettina.berendt).  http://cybersecuritychallenge.org.uk/ http://people.cs.kuleuven.be/~bettina.berendt  Cybersecurity competitions — the status in Europe  October 2014  Page  4  out that training and awareness raising are needed, and that these activities have to take into  account specific user needs and insights about human learning. Standards can play several roles in  increasing security, including conveying the notion that an individual company or institution is not  alone with specific security problems.  Other presentations also emphasised the need for ‘specialised experts’ of various kinds and  mentioned the diversity of the target groups for concrete types of events. For example, Symantec’s  Cyber Readiness Challenge ‘can accommodate very different levels of skills’, and the DefCamp  hacking conference recently started organising capture-the-flag exercises for children (DefCamp  Kids). The Uk Cyber Security Challenge provides safe environments where people can test and  demonstrate their skills; and showcases the spread of opportunities for future cyber defenders as  well as informs participants about available education and training opportunities.  The short discussion centred on two, related questions. One was the question of how a hard-to- reach but important target group, a range of SMEs, could profit from the activities described. Cisco  called on universities to use the Cisco courses also in teaching activities aimed at a wider audience  (including SMEs), and Symantec offers awareness-raising tools for the general public. Another  question was to what extent the didactic approaches described above could also be employed in  training and awareness-raising for non-expert computer/data users. This might be beneficial  because the didactic style is more hands-on and constructivist than the more frequently used  ‘lecture-style’ teaching activities — and thus more likely to be successful in the area of security  where not only knowledge but also practices shape outcomes. However, many questions will need  to be addressed.  The restricted time of the workshop did not permit an in-depth discussion of this question. Professor  Berendt, who was the rapporteur for this session, has additional useful thoughts based on her own  experience: ‘Users’ contexts and ways of learning would have to be taken seriously. Such training  forms, and of course the good security and privacy practices they are meant to create or sustain,  cost time and resources, and people cannot reasonably be expected to do this on the side in  addition to all their other tasks. Managers, teachers, etc. thus need to commit more deeply than .  just giving lecture-style instructions, also questioning their own practices. Trade-offs (e.g. with costs,  labour, flexibility, hierarchy) will need to be taken into account, and organisations will have to  confront and address the conflicts that can arise between different stakeholders, user roles, etc. This  non-uniqueness of the notions of security and privacy will probably be among the most challenging,  but also most interesting, aspects of future education and training.  Cybersecurity competitions — the status in Europe  October 2014  Page  5  2.2 Austrian competition  Austria’s search for cybersecurity talent (9)  Cyber Security Austria (CSA) organises an annual contest in cooperation with the Ministry of Defence  and Sport.  Cyber Security Challenge 2014 is be the largest such contest in the search for the  country’s most promising young hackers, to secure their talents in the long term and to help them  develop into cybersecurity experts of the future. ‘With Cyber Security Challenge 2014, we want to  strengthen the image of the talented local hacker scene due to the first cybersecurity challenge’,  says Joe Pichlmayr, council member for Cyber Security Austria (CSA). ‘We are searching hard for  Austria’s young and up-and-coming IT talent who want to prove their skills in a legal way and want  to compare their knowledge with others in their age group.’  Last year over 600 teenagers participated. This year, a big increase in the number of contestants is  expected as the criteria have been extended to cover university students as the challenge goes into  its third year. Additionally, the potential winner has increased motivation: a place in an international  competition against winners from Germany and Switzerland — the international Cyber Security  Challenge — who will challenge Austria’s finest in the grand finals.  Searching for ‘insanely good’ talent  With the slogan ‘Are you insanely good? Then show us!’, CSA, the Ministry of Defence and Sport  and Kuratorium Sicheres Österreich (KSÖ) are inviting all pupils and students in the country to get  involved with IT security.  ‘For us this contest is not only about finding the best young hacker in Austria: we also want to  understand how far advanced the skills and knowledge of the young people already are,’ says Joe  Pichlmayr. ‘Therefore, we are especially interested in their paths to finding solutions and how they  think, act and process ways to solve various hacks.’  Interested teenagers can register for Cyber Security Challenge Austria 2014 on the official  website (10). The challenge commenced on 6 May 2014. The Hacking Lab — a special kind of Internet  security laboratory — was unlocked on the first day, and it is on that platform that the challenge is  taking place.  ‘Hacking Lab’ as the centrepiece of the challenge  The centrepiece of the challenge is the so-called Hacking Lab. This refers to a remotely controlled  security laboratory, which was developed by Compass Security AG. The laboratory contains 150  different security challenges from all areas of IT, which can be used in the context of the security  challenge. To solve them, the contestants access specifically prepared, vulnerable systems through a  VPN remote connection. Another feature of the Hacking Lab is the option to link tasks with solution  applications, discussion possibilities and scoring.  A challenge for ambitious young hackers  School pupils, young people and students  The tasks are very diverse, requiring pupils and students to successfully pass one or more technical  tests in order to finish the challenge. The solutions are then submitted online to the Hacking Lab.  During the submission, additional questions are posed, such as which IT security breaches were  available, how the security breach could be used and what was the best alternative to protect the  system from these threats.

It is important for us that  the young people do not only encounter matters of hacking and IT attacks, but must also address  and understand counter-measures. With this action, we want these talented people to have a  certain perspective on the matter, similar to those of IT security experts,’ Joe Pichlmayr says.  How the Cyber Security Challenge works  On the start date on 6 May, all participants received new assignments which are to be solved alone  and creatively. Experts from Cyber Security Austria are conducting ongoing supervision and  performance evaluation, and supporting the contestants as coaches.  The best 10 participants in each of the contests, for school pupils and young people and for  students, qualify for the national finals, which were held from 11 to 14 September 2014 in  Hagenberg.  The two winning teams of pupils and students then represent Team Austria in the international  Cyber Security Challenge. They challenge the winners of the equivalent German and Swiss challenges  at a contest which took place from 3 to 5 November 2014 in Fürstenfeld, during  the largest Austrian  security event, the ICT security conference of the Ministry of Defence and Sport.  Live hacks, finals and appealing prices  The finals took the form of a team competition, where two teams with five people in each have to  compete against each other in different live challenges. The awards ceremony of the Austrian  challenge took place on 13 September 2014 at the Ars Electronica Centre, Linz. The awards  ceremony for the European Cyber Security Challenge 2014 was on 6 November 2014 in the festivities  of the Museum of Military History (Heeresgeschichtliches Museum) in Vienna in the presence of  politicians, economists and representatives of government bodies.  ‘Hire the hackers’ — cybersecurity experts for public authorities and businesses  Beside Cyber Security Austria, the Defence Agency and the Kuratorium Sicheres Österreich (KSÖ) are  also supporting Cyber Security Challenge Austria 2014 and thereby bringing it to the attention of  authorities and businesses.  The Austrian job market is urgently seeking highly qualified IT security experts. The protection of  essential IT infrastructure is becoming more and more important in both the public and private  sectors. To meet this challenge on a long-term basis, young people with talent and enthusiasm for IT  must be encouraged from the earliest age possible and trained to be the future IT security specialists  that the region needs.  ‘For the ÖBH (Army of Austria) to fulfil its goals, it needs a secure and reliable operation with various  ICT systems,’ explains ObstdG Mag. Unger, head of the department for cyberdefence and ICT  security. ‘Furthermore, the ÖBH has [been given] responsibility for cyberdefence. That is why it  needs a large number of highly qualified ICT security experts — firstly, to protect the military ICT  systems and secondly, to help in the cybersecurity area if others cannot continue anymore.’  Therefore the CSA, the Defence Agency and the KSÖ are following the approach of ‘hiring the  hackers’. Young IT talents need to be scouted at an early age and their skills and strengths need to  be developed with the support of public authorities and businesses. ‘Together with the experts from  Cyber Security Austria, we want to establish the crucial job sector of IT security [among young  people] to make Austria more secure,’ adds Kunstmann. ‘The economy knows of its role and  responsibility and supports the challenge on an organisational and financial level.’  Cybersecurity competitions — the status in Europe  October 2014  Page  7  Preventing illegal activities  For the CSA the challenge also has other goals. ‘Through a direct and early approach to youngsters  who are passionate about IT, we want to prevent from them using their knowledge sooner or later  for illegal activities. With the challenge, we set a certain representation in the group of young adults  and deliberately want to encourage them to follow a legal path.’ Participants in Cyber Security  Challenge Austria have to sign a code of ethics, whereby they confirm in writing that they have been  informed about the legal boundaries of hacking, and that they are not allowed to use the techniques  they have learned for abusive purposes.  Widespread support from politicians, economists and government  For Cyber Security Challenge Austria 2014 to meet its goals, the organisers rely on cooperation with  the Ministry for Internal Affairs and the Ministry for Defence and Sport. The Office of the Chancellor,  ENISA and the Federal Agency for IT have also provided support. Financial aid from notable  companies in the sector is also greatly appreciated. Special thanks go to A1 Telekom Austria,  Sprecher-Automation, Philippeit, FabaSoft, Kapsch, ACP, SEC-Consult, IKARUS, Symantec, ArrowECS,  Barracuda, the Computer Company Computershop GesmbH, the WKO — Bundeswirtschaftskammer,  A-Trust and the Bundesrechenzentrum BRZ as well as the University of Applied Science Upper  Austria, the University of Applied Science Technikum Vienna and the University of Applied Science  St Pölten.  Several insights from the Cyber Security Challenge Austria 2012/13  The Cyber Security Challenge 2012/13 gave the organisers many surprising insights and featured  many more ‘wow moments’ than expected. Over 400 pupils and young people took part in the first  challenge, which was conducted through the virtual laboratory environment of the Swiss Compass  Verlag (Hacking Lab). Their performances surprised both the organisers and operators of the hacking  labs. In certain exercises, the solution rate was 10 times higher than for other, comparable  participants who had taken part in the hacking lab. In addition, more contestants than expected  successfully accomplished the hardest tasks available.  The exceptionally high performance level was later confirmed by the  participation of the finalists of the Cyber Security Challenge in other ‘hacker  contests’ with a very high ranking.  The 25 best contestants in the challenge and Cyber Security Austria enjoy a constant dialogue, which  was formed through the Centre of Excellence. In the Centre of Excellence, it has been ascertained  that the participants know very well what is allowed and what is prohibited. They want to distance  themselves from illegal ‘hacks’.  Most of them suffer from the fact that their family and school environment cannot recognise,  appreciate and value their performance and skills — a well-known phenomenon that many very  gifted people have to tolerate. Every one of the top 10 in the challenge can choose from numerous  offers from the business world by this time. Immediately after the contest and awards ceremony,  the finalists received several job offers. In the 2013 challenge, the group of participants was  extended from school pupils and young people to students from universities of applied science and  other universities. The best of the best are determined in two parallel contests and will confront the  winners of the Swiss challenge after the finals. For Cyber Security Austria it is clear that the challenge  needs to be expanded and to establish itself as a ‘high-class-event’. Therefore the bilateral  Cybersecurity competitions — the status in Europe  October 2014  Page  8  competition with the Swiss will only be a first step in the right direction. It will also support  awareness for the construction of the structures that are needed to motivate and develop highly  talented top people.  Further information on Cyber Security Austria (11)  About the Agency of Defence  The Agency of Defence is an intelligence service of the Austrian army with three main tasks — the  classic task of intelligence protection, the perception of military security including ICT security and  the perception of tasks in line with Information Security Law — as well as the ability and  competence to recognise threats to military security in time for them to react with proper counter  measures. With the establishment of military computer emergency readiness teams (MilCERT),  Austria has taken a major step towards a general concept of defence against digital threats. These  capabilities (in cooperation with other departments in the Austrian army) complement special  knowledge in the areas of forensics or the audits of rooms and facilities.  2.3 Swiss competition  The Swiss Cyber Storm association organised the 2014 edition of its annual Cyber Security Challenge.  This was the largest contest in the search for the country’s most promising young cybersecurity  talents, to promote their skills and to convince them to pursue a career in cybersecurity. In 2013,  over 200 contestants participated. A slight increase in contestants was registered in 2014, as the  participant criteria have been modified to include people who have completed their bachelor’s  degree — but do not hold a higher degree — and are no older than 30 years. Furthermore, the fact  that the international competition in which the winning team can participate has been extended  from two to three countries (the others are Austria and Germany) should make the challenge more  attractive.  Basic idea and target audience  The challenge is very diverse in that pupils and students have to successfully pass one or more  technical tasks in order to finish it. The solutions are then submitted online to a Hacking Lab. A  solution consists not only of how the problem was solved but also how the underlying weakness in  the software/hardware/system architecture or similar (if any) would have to be modified to fix or  prevent it. By requiring this additional step, Swiss Cyber Storm stresses its ambitions to educate  contestants.  Swiss Cyber Storm wants young people not only to be met with matters of  hacking and IT attacks, but also to learn to address and understand counter-  measures.  Hacking Lab: providing a platform for cybersecurity challenges  The centrepiece of the challenge is the ‘Hacking Lab’ — an online platform offering a controlled  security laboratory developed by Compass Security AG. The laboratory offers free access to a limited  set of security challenges, for example those published by OWASP, but it can also be used to  (11) http://www.cybersecurity.at  http://www.cybersecurity.at/  Cybersecurity competitions — the status in Europe  October 2014  Page  9  establish public and private security challenges or to do security training. To solve the challenges,  the contestants usually download a live CD or virtual machine image (e.g. for VMWare). Both of  these come with all the required tools pre-installed and offer a one-click solution to initiate the VPN  connection to the security laboratory from where the specifically prepared systems for the  challenges are accessible. However, some of the challenges can also be solved locally. For challenge  organisers, the Hacking Lab offers convenient management and teacher views which make things  like rating submissions and providing feedback to the contestants easy. The Hacking Lab platform is  basically open to anyone. It attracts a large community of people from all over, some of whom even  actively propose and create new security challenges. Currently, there are over 150 security  challenges in domains like web application security, forensics, malware analysis, cryptography,  mobile device security, operating systems security and reverse engineering. Compass Security AG  says it is also very open to academic partners: it cooperates, for example, with the universities of  applied sciences in Zurich (ZHAW) and Bern (BFH).  Organisation and support  The Swiss Cyber Storm Security Challenge is organised by a committee consisting of members of the  Swiss Cyber Storm association and works on an unsalaried basis. In 2014, the Swiss government is  supporting this effort with patronage from the Swiss Reporting and Analysis Centre for Information  Assurance (Melani) (12) and the Swiss Police ICT association (13) (German and French only). This  association sponsors the annual Swiss police computer science congress, SPIK, whose goal is to make  all involved specialists and managers of police forces, the IT industry and politicians familiar with  new ideas, developments and products. A political committee with representatives from the five  governing parties, a civil servant and a police commander serves as a consultative body and a link to  politics. The patronage and support from the government (Melani) and organisations like Swiss  Police ICT is crucial for finding sponsors — which is vital since there is (almost) no financial support  from the patrons — and for the promotion of the challenge. However, Swiss Cyber Storm has  demonstrated that even without financial support from the government, it is possible to organise  and run such a challenge. Special thanks go to supporting companies like Aspectra, InfoGuard,  Kaspersky, Kudelsky Security, PwC, Swisscom, Symantec, terreActive, United Security Providers and  the two universities of applied sciences in Zurich and Bern. It is important to note that Swiss Cyber  Storm was inspired by the Cyber Security Austria team and has strong ties to it. It is also important  to note that, for 2015, there are ongoing negotiations with the Federal Department of Foreign  Affairs (EDA) to bring the challenge up to the next level by providing additional financial and  organisational support.  How the Cyber Security Challenge works  The challenge is split into three phases.  Phase 1 Registration and online qualification (14) May to September  Phase 2 Swiss national final 21–22 October  Phase 3 European Cyber Security Challenge 3—6 November  (12)  http://www.melani.admin.ch/index.html?lang=en  (13)  http://www.spik.ch/  (14)  Using https://www.hacking-lab.com/index.html  http://www.melani.admin.ch/index.html?lang=en http://www.spik.ch/ https://www.hacking-lab.com/index.html  Cybersecurity competitions — the status in Europe  October 2014  Page  10  Phase 1: Registration and online qualification  In the first phase, pupils and apprentices between 14 and 20 years old and ‘cyber talents’ between  20 and 30 years who do not (yet) have a master’s degree (15) can register for the Swiss Cyber Storm  qualification event on the Hacking Lab platform. Participants in this event have access to the security  challenges, which get unlocked on a monthly basis between May and September. By solving these  challenges, which include tasks from domains such as web application security, cryptography,  forensics, penetration testing or reverse engineering, they can collect points to improve their  ranking among the participants. Checking and rating the solutions submitted by the participants is  the most time-consuming and expensive task for the organiser. Since most challenges can be solved  in many different and sometimes unforeseen ways, the submissions must be checked and rated by  IT security experts. This expertise is also required because the solution does not only have to include  a description of the solution to the challenge (e.g. finding and exploiting a vulnerability in a web  application) but also a description of how to mitigate the problem.  Phase 2: Swiss national final  After the end of the qualification phase, the top 10 participants from each of the two categories  were invited to the Swiss national final on 21 and 22 October 2014 in Lucerne. On the first day, the  two teams for the next day’s final, consisting of five contestants from each of the two categories,  were formed. Team-building activities were planned and supervised by two experts. In the evening,  the contestants participated in the VIP event of the Swiss Cyber Storm IT security conference. During  this event, the contestants had the opportunity to talk to speakers, IT security professionals and  decision-makers to extend their network and to ask critical questions or to discuss fresh ideas and  viewpoints with the ‘establishment’. The awards ceremony of the Swiss Cyber Storm cybersecurity  challenge was held the next day during the closing session of the Swiss Cyber Storm IT security  conference running in parallel to the Swiss national final.  Phase 3: European Cyber Security Challenge  The winning team then represented Switzerland in the European Cyber Security Challenge from 3 to  5 November 2014 in Fürstenfeld. The finals took the form of a competition between teams from  Austria, Germany and Switzerland, who compete against each other in different live challenges. The  Swiss delegation consisted of the Swiss team and seven staff members from the Swiss Cyber Storm  association. After the challenge, the teams traveled to an awards ceremony on 6 November at the  Museum of Military History in Vienna, in the presence of politicians, economists and representatives  of government bodies.  Need for cybersecurity experts for public authorities and businesses  The protection of essential IT infrastructure is becoming increasingly important in both the public  and private sectors. The Swiss job market is desperately seeking highly qualified IT security experts  and to ensure this on a long-term basis talented young people who are enthusiastic about IT must be  encouraged from the earliest age possible, and trained to become the future IT security specialists  that the region needs. However, this is not easy because there are so many ‘cool’ opportunities in IT  which are much more visible to young talents than a career in IT security. To improve the odds, IT  security must be made more visible and tangible. Swiss Cyber Storm and its supporters are  convinced that an (inter)national IT security challenge is an important building block in achieving this  goal. With its supporters ranging from the Swiss Reporting and Analysis Centre for Information  Assurance (Melani) and the Swiss Police ICT association to sponsors from the private sector, Swiss  (15) For details see https://www.swisscyberstorm.com/securitychallenge/eligibility-requirements/  https://www.swisscyberstorm.com/securitychallenge/eligibility-requirements/  Cybersecurity competitions — the status in Europe  October 2014  Page  11  Cyber Storm is making sure that the interests and concerns of authorities and businesses are  respected and taken into account.  Preventing illegal activities  For most youngsters, learning how to hack systems is more appealing than learning how to protect  them. Through a direct and early approach to young people who are passionate about IT, Swiss  Cyber Storm wants to prevent them from using their knowledge, sooner or later, for illegal activities.  With the challenge, these youngsters not only get an opportunity to test their skills in a legal setting  but they are also encouraged to follow a legal path. Participants in the Swiss Cyber Storm Security  Challenge have to sign a code of ethics, where they confirm, in writing, that they have been  informed of the legal boundaries of hacking and that they are not allowed to use the techniques  they have learned for abusive purposes.  Cybersecurity competitions — the status in Europe  October 2014  Page  12  2.4 Romanian competition  There is one important rule though — hack before getting hacked!  DefCamp (D-CTF) in numbers  • In 3 years, four editions with teams of maximum five members  • Jeopardy, attack/defence and cyberattack scenarios  • 800 teams worldwide (75 % of the total number of teams competed in 2013)  How it all started  D-CTF was born in 2011 together with DefCamp, one of the most important conferences on hacking  and information security in central and eastern Europe. The goal was to bring about hands-on talks  about latest research and practices from the information and security field, gathering under the  same roof security specialists, entrepreneurs and academics, from both the private and public  sectors. But a simple conference was too easy and so they created D-CTF. The operation started in  2011 with around 10 teams and has registered about 800 teams worldwide to date (75 % of the total  number of teams competed in 2013).  Why D-CTF?  D-CTF says it’s all about teamwork, having one’s eyes wide open and possessing remarkable skills. It  spreads the newest security techniques and enables the security skills of the teams to be measured.  A complete team covering all the main skills is always the best option for getting into the finals.  At the same time the competition strengthens both technical and management skills; the leader  coordinates every step of the process, making sure that the team is following a line that will result in  capturing the flag. Mystery, mathematics and complicated algorithms combine to make everything  even more challenging. Some consider this competition to be a game, because originally it was a  game that simulates small team combat, based on defending an immobile flag while trying to  capture the flag of the other team.  Cybersecurity competitions — the status in Europe  October 2014  Page  13  Having the right team and knowing the right techniques to achieve the goal is most important. Of  course everything is doubled by:   effectiveness;   responsiveness;   team coordination.  How it works  D-CTF has two main parts: online qualification followed by a final challenge that usually happens  during DefCamp. The essentials regarding the online qualification are that the team leader registers  the team and it waits for the challenges to be sent on a specific day announced on the official  website. The team then has 48 hours to solve 25 problems in jeopardy style. The 10 teams that finish  all the challenges in time with the best results can enter the D-CTF finals that happen during  DefCamp. In the finals, the teams will have another 24 hours of challenges. The best teams will  receive prizes in the form of both cash and products worth thousands of euros.  Rules to follow:   Teams can have a  maximum of five members (including the team leader).   Denial of D-CTF service/servers is not allowed.   Finding bugs in D-CTF infrastructure can give the team more points.   The most important rule is though — hack before getting hacked!  Results:   48 hours of intensive work   Gaining knowledge   Simulating a live experiment   Facing challenges   Cash and/or an awesome experience  D-CTF says: ‘It’s an addictive competition that always manages to bring the strongest, [most] skilled  and [most] passionate teams that are at any time ready to take over the world, to face the  challenges and of course to take all the money — the cash prizes.’  Why D-CTF?  The Cyber Security Research Centre from Romania (CCSIR) (16) is a non-governmental organisation  with the sole purpose of promoting, supporting, implementing and coordinating security research in  the information security field in Romania, as well as international actions with short-, medium- and  long-term partnerships in the information security arena. ‘We are a team of passionate people with  a technical background,’ CCSIR says, ‘and now our main goal is to spread respect for cybersecurity  competitions worldwide.’  Organisation and support  ‘We struggle every year to get sponsors supporting our initiatives,’ CCSIR says. ‘In 2014 we’ve  created a special package in order to get a specific amount of money for D-CTF because we believe  that it’s the most important asset we have. Also because we have skilled people registering for this  (16)  http://ccsir.org/  http://ccsir.org/  Cybersecurity competitions — the status in Europe  October 2014  Page  14  competition and we want to reward and motivate them to further develop their skills and to keep  their eyes wide open for challenges. We put a lot of work every year into developing and spreading  the word about D-CTF and every year more and more companies are interested [in providing  support] either for hiring talent or to help the organisation to achieve the annual goal.’  The D-CTF success story  ‘It’s great to see talented teams going further after D-CTF finals,’ CCSIR adds. ‘Hexcellents, the 2012  and 2013 winning team from D-CTF, is the team that represents Romania in the largest CTF  competitions worldwide. Not only this, but [it] also ranked in the top 15 out of almost 1 000 teams  from all over the world. Also, one of our amazing challenges developer has won several international  competitions [and] he is now in one of the top five international teams for CTFs and he was recruited  by Facebook.’  The prizes  Cybersecurity competitions — the status in Europe  October 2014  Page  15  2.5 Spanish competition  CYBERCAMP17  The aim of Spanish CyberCamp is to promote cyberskills talent of our future professionals in  cybersecurity by running advanced challenges and competitions for best spanish students and  researchers in cybersecurity as well as best international talented professionals.  CyberCamp is sponsored by the government through the Confidence Plan18 of the Digital Agenda of  Spain19.  The first edition has an online qualifying phase during October-November 2014 and the physical  event takes place during a weekend on 5-7 December in Madrid.  The physical event is a great opportunity to share experiences among the different participants and  to create a better link between the top talents or best projects to the industry recruiters or  investors’ interests respectively.  • Incentives and prices for the best contesters: networking, entertainment, recruiting, grants,  attractive training and travelling to international events;  • Challenges: top talents from previous online phase are invited to the event to compete at  CyberCamp (CTF- Blue Team/Red Team contest).

Cybercamp is open to scientific, university, company, online communities or  students who want to use it as a platform to disseminate their projects.  Currently, there is a contact network with international universities, public and private institutions in  the field of science, innovation and entrepreneurship that we will consider accordingly. Likewise,  many online communities and youth associations that support dissemination of Cybersecurity  activities.  All this makes a comprehensive approach so that CyberCamp can consider the different needs to be  met before and during the Event.  In addition, partners and potential sponsors are supported in a specific communication strategy. It  gives opportunity to brand visibility and improving corporate image. Clear objectives are being  defined to align the audience Cybercamp and interested brands.  Interactive support platform  CyberCamp wishes to broadcast the event activities and encourage conversation among attendees.  The platform will be a place to collect all content, materials and discussions that occur during the  event.  The platform is designed exclusively to meet the needs that can generate the call for a challenge,  both locally and globally. It allows users to register on the challenges that interest them and can  upload their projects and provide all necessary documentation. It bridges talent, companies and  institutions to create value and contribute to innovative solutions and ideas.  The platform may also collect data to participate in itineraries such as \"the best entrepreneur\"  contest. The information received will be considered for selection, evaluation and development of  participants to raise Cybersecurity talent in Spain.  The cyber security challenge is split in two phases:  Phase 1 Online Challenge - Registration and online  qualification www.cybercamp.es  October  Phase 2 Insitu Challenge - Spanish national final 6-7 December  Phase 1: Online Challenge - Registration and online Qualification  CyberCamp.es portal was open for registration from September.  It  allowed the users to assess their skills during a first qualification phase. Different categories were  released every week in October for the contest. After that, the challenges remained active as a  playground outside the contest. Quick responses were rated higher for each of the challenges and  bonus decrease over time. The first to answer correctly has 200% value of its original score, the  second answer has 150%, the third 125% rating and, after that, correct answers are valued at 100%.  Type of online challenges:   System Vulnerabilities: related with virtual images analysis and vulnerable configurations.   Reversing: related to Analysis of malware and APKs.   Forensics: Memory Dumps and USB / HD disk.  http://www.cybercamp.es/  Cybersecurity competitions — the status in Europe  October 2014  Page  17   Code Analysis: source code review for potential vulnerabilities   Web Vulnerabilities: attacks to websites.   Cryptography: Analysis of Steganography and ciphering.  Phase 2: In situ Challenge - Spanish national final  It is held in Madrid during Cybercamp Event on 5-7 December. The final phase of the challenge is the  so-called “Insitu Challenge”. It refers to a fortified platform for cybersecurity challenges as a  controlled security laboratory.  A platform allows the assessment of expertise and users reaction in an unknown environment. The  challenges will be available in Spanish and English with an educational focus and the aim is to  develop their technical skills. The simulation environment is similar to a real case where participants  use their own desktop equipment to perform quizzes. The platform has a web interface that allows  access from the most common operating systems.  The design allows the grouping of tests in the following categories or phases:   Recognition: Phase where participants test their ability to detect vulnerabilities in exposed  environments.   Raid: This phase offer systems to try to access them.   Discovery: In this phase is focused on the internal network infrastructure system that was  attacked.   Capture: this phase evidences guide the participant to gain control over critical systems in  the attacked environment.   Exfiltration: During this last phase, the participant obtains critical system information and  take it to its computer.  The estimated challenge duration is 6 hours. We are selecting the number of suitable tests, duration  of each test with certain specifications, test complexity, dependencies between tests, objectives to  be achieved and other design elements.  Cybersecurity competitions — the status in Europe  October 2014  Page  18  2.6 United Kingdom competition  Cyber Security Challenge UK Ltd is a not-for-profit company formed in March 2010 to plug the  cybersecurity skills gap in the UK. About 90 % of professionals surveyed had difficulties recruiting the  cybersecurity talent needed by their companies, across all eight categories of cybersecurity jobs  surveyed. Nearly 60 % predicted (correctly) an increase in the number of jobs there would be in the  British market in cybersecurity. The mission of the Cyber Security Challenge is to ensure that  sufficient numbers of those, of any age, with a talent for cybersecurity are identified, inspired and  enabled to find training and fill such jobs as are needed to provide efficient protection of the United  Kingdom’s economic prosperity, national security and chosen way of life. The company runs on  sponsorship from the government, the private sector and academia, all of which recognise the  national importance of cybersecurity, not just for national security reasons or to allow citizens to  safely choose to take actions using digital means but also to underpin the economy and enable the  market growth needed for the United Kingdom’s future prosperity and success. Cyber Security  Challenge is a unique programme of activities designed to introduce sufficient numbers of talented  people to learning and career opportunities in the cybersecurity profession.  At the heart of this is the national competition programme but a growing schools  programme, learning opportunities at cybercamps and networking initiatives are  all linked together to identify, inspire, inform and enable more EU citizens  resident in the UK to become cybersecurity professionals.  Only those not currently working in cybersecurity are eligible to compete in these competitions.  Previous winners have ranged from a postman who now works for Royal Mail as a vulnerability  manager to a university undergraduate also now employed in a cybersecurity profession.  Cybersecurity skills shortages are a problem in many countries. In line with British government  support for international collaboration on cybersecurity issues, the Cyber Security Challenge  welcomes partnerships with other organisations which do similar work in Europe or elsewhere. Its  sponsors are often multinational and there is interest amongst them in supporting competitions run  in other countries and in getting value from the potential public relations opportunities and benefits  of such competitions. This could be by many countries playing the same competition or a play-off  between teams from different countries. An objective in Cyber Security Challenge UK’s business plan  for 2014 is ‘to forge partnerships with other competition runners to link to more people interested  in cybersecurity and encourage our candidates to experience other competitions’.  Competition programme  The initial concept was to identify talent through a range of virtual competitions (to reach large  numbers), then to meet the most talented at face-to-face sessions and finally to enable them to get  jobs, through giving them prizes that provide training and networking opportunities.  Cybersecurity competitions — the status in Europe  October 2014  Page  19  The company was registered in March 2010, launched in April and started its first three competitions  in July. Only one, designed by QinetiQ, was a new competition: Sans Institute provided a challenge it  had used in the United States. The US Department of Defence allowed Cyber Security Challenge UK  to be a strand of its international digital forensics competition. Each of the three competitions dealt  with a different subject within cybersecurity and the winners flowed through to one of two face-to- face competitions and then a masterclass final. Within 3 weeks 4 000 people had registered to play.  Cyber Security Challenge UK now runs many more competitions but sponsors continue to supply all  of them as part of their sponsorship contribution. The Cyber Security Challenge team moderates for  quality and fairness and ensures competitions are testing the skills that businesses and government  need. It manages the marking of face-to-face competitions with the help of sponsors from different  companies who observe candidates’ performance, scoring them on a matrix of skills and  competencies. The types of competitions run have tested defensive skills, knowledge of different  vectors of attack, digital forensics, policy and procedures and more.  The virtual nature of the first games allows large numbers to play but only 100–200 are successful in  reaching the face-to-face stage and this year there were 40 at the masterclass final. Some candidates  do not make it to the final as they get jobs in cybersecurity, rendering them ineligible. Cyber Security  Challenge UK has built on the success of its first year and developed year by year. There are now  about seven virtual challenges annually. Its most recent virtual competition, written by Sophos, had  over 600 registrations. Then there are about four face-to-face challenges, with some 30 candidates  in each. The plan for this year is to establish a play-on-demand platform which will allow candidates  to play at different times and should increase the breadth of the company’s reach. In addition it runs  ad hoc competitions like a Christmas cipher which had some 1 500 entrants.  Virtual competitions focused on skills needed  Finalists meet face to face  Development, training and further challenges  Identify talent — pull through to courses and jobs  Enable careers through prizes such as private sector  training courses, networking opportunities and  payment of university fees  Clarify what  cybersecurity  jobs are, why  they are fun  and what the  career options  are  Cybersecurity competitions — the status in Europe  October 2014  Page  20  Technical competence is the key component but at the face-to-face stage interpersonal skills are  also tested. The masterclass winner, the cybersecurity champion of the United Kingdom, will be  strong in both technical and interpersonal skills. There is not just one winner and a runner-up  though. The prize portfolio (all donations of training or networking opportunities from companies,  government or universities) is worth about GBP 100 000 so a lot of candidates benefit and get the lift  they need to make a successful start in a career in cybersecurity. Candidates in each masterclass are  marked both for their individual performance and as part of a team.  The last masterclass had teams being the front-line defenders in dealing with a series of attacks. In  the course of a day and a half the attacks emerged as being not just criminal but nationally critical,  bringing down national infrastructure. The teams had to identify what was happening technically,  find ways to stop the attacks and also brief the press and government. This competition was written  by BT, GCHQ, the National Crime Agency and Juniper Networks. Candidates had an exhausting but  exhilarating time, learning much along the way. The markers came from about 20 different sponsor  companies.  For the first time all the competitions in this year’s annual programme are linked  around a single theme. This is to raise excitement and fun as the programme develops and give a  feeling of progress as the story unfolds. The last masterclass awards ceremony was interrupted by a  video from a masked group calling themselves the Flag Day Associates whose terrifying messages  warned of future attacks on the United Kingdom. Following this, the challenge announced that the  investigation of, and defence against, the threat posed by the Flag Day Associates will be undertaken  by the challenge’s candidates. In order to best defend the United Kingdom from this threat, the  competition programme over the coming months will serve to both find out more information about  this mysterious organisation, and identify the skills and expertise required to protect against it.  Issues and candidate stakeholder groups. Knowledge of training and jobs  Cyber Security Challenge UK says that one first year surprise was that most of the candidates (who  by definition were interested in cybersecurity) stated in a questionnaire that they knew little or  nothing about cybersecurity careers and training opportunities. However 84 % were interested in  being introduced to potential employers. Most were competing to demonstrate their skills, not to  find a job. But by the end of the year 87 % said they were more likely to consider a job in  cybersecurity and over 90 % thought they had learned more about cybersecurity jobs and developed  their skills. ‘In retrospect it is not surprising that people are not knowledgeable about cybersecurity  jobs which are quite new and totally different from the security jobs of a decade ago,' the company  says. ‘In addition our education system has not yet grown to include cybersecurity within the  curriculum at schools.’  We realised that we needed to do more than spot available talent, it is necessary  to develop a whole pipeline of people for the future.  In response to the need to provide information about jobs, the company is continuing to develop the  opportunities for candidates to network with employers, especially its sponsors, attend  cybersecurity events, run cyberfairs and build the provision of careers and training information on its  website. Candidates have found that meeting sponsors has been important and has brought the jobs  to life for them. To build the pipeline for the future the company is engaging with different  stakeholder groups from those at school or university to those already employed, but not in  cybersecurity.  Cybersecurity competitions — the status in Europe  October 2014  Page  21  One candidate recruited by a PwC threat and vulnerability team commented: ‘The challenge helped  me to meet employers who could see what I could do.’  Development  All competitions give some opportunity for development and learning. Cyber Security Challenge UK  says it welcomes the fact that candidates can research answers for some of the virtual competitions.  It is working to grow the opportunities to develop and learn and is establishing a more structured  sort of cybercamp. It has already run cybercamps hosted by universities and by the UK Ministry of  Defence and in 2014 is running two cybercamps with a new design aimed at those who know they  want to follow a cybersecurity career. These will pilot a structured programme of learning and  competitions and those who reach the required standard will qualify to take a government- recognised qualification, to equip them for jobs. Introductory training materials will also be provided  online to equip more people to compete.  Diversity  Only 8 % of year one candidates were female and only 4 % of year two. There have never been more  than two women at a masterclass. The United Kingdom is keen to recruit from the whole population  and it is a government objective to draw more women into technical jobs. Cyber Security Challenge  UK is working with partners like Stemnet to maximise impact and has launched a number of  initiatives designed to involve more women in competitions. These range from showing successful  women as role models in video clips about jobs on the website to reshaping some of the marketing  materials and running an event to draw in the support of the current female cybersecurity  community. The latter took place at Bletchley Park and some of the original female code-breakers  attended. Their role in successful wartime code-breaking is only now being recognised. The Times  newspaper reported this message from one of the original code-breakers, Ruth Bourne, now aged  87: ‘It is all about brains, brains, brains … Don’t be put off by the mathematical suggestions. If I could  be trained to operate one of those machines as a kid … you could do it now in spades.’  Schools  Cyber Security Challenge UK says it wants to reach anyone of any age who might have the talent to  do well in cybersecurity. Each year the standard of its candidates has got higher. ‘This has been good  for employers wishing to recruit but it has meant that few schoolchildren reach the face-to-face  stage of our competitions and we want to avoid discouraging them. In response to this a schools  programme was launched last year initially reaching over 500 schools. This is growing and in 2014/15  will reach classes of about 30 in over 1 000 schools.’ The programme has two strands — firstly, a  teacher pack giving a lesson plan keyed to the small relevant items in the national curriculum and a  number of exercises designed by sponsors, and secondly, a competition, focused this year on coding.  The six best schools in the coding competition competed in a face-to-face final which demonstrated  the physical impacts of cybersecurity — carrying out, for example, actions to move a robot. The  enthusiasm generated has been encouraging and school groups have participated in some of the  networking events involving key people in cybersecurity. The government is seeking to introduce  some cybersecurity into the curriculum and Cyber Security Challenge UK says it will develop its  programme to link into this and continue to support teachers. ‘We are working with one of our  sponsors, Northrop Grumman, to introduce the Cyber Centurion programme to the United Kingdom  (Cyber Patriot in the United States). This will plug the gap between our schools programme and the  national competition programme, drawing students through from one to the other.’  Universities  Cyber Security Challenge UK is working with some universities which are developing their own  competitions and playing against other universities. The company would like to further develop its  Cybersecurity competitions — the status in Europe  October 2014  Page  22  work with universities (perhaps through university interest groups to foster enthusiasm for jobs and  cybersecurity as a subject), run university competitions and draw good candidates through to the  national competition programme. Cybersecurity skills may be found not only amongst those taking  IT or computer studies but a wide variety of other subjects. Cybersecurity is becoming a life skill  needed by all and we would like to encourage modules on cybersecurity in a number of subjects, the  more obvious being engineering and business studies.  People already in employment  Those already in jobs but lacking the means to prove their competence and transition to cyberjobs  are low-hanging fruit for those looking to recruit. They may prove to be the group which will benefit  most from the learning opportunities that the new cybercamps will provide (see above).  Alumni  Cyber Security Challenge UK has a database of around 11 000 individuals interested in cybersecurity  and successful candidates become members of an alumni group. This group supports the company  in a number of ways, including providing outreach to new communities, informing its activities and  sometimes helping with the running of competitions.  Sponsors: why do they offer support?  Private sector sponsors are attracted firstly because they recognise the skills shortage in  cybersecurity. They see this as a problem that will impact on their businesses and that they cannot  rectify alone. So corporate social responsibility is a starting block: beyond this, they look to benefit in  different ways from their partnership with the challenge, reaching agreements that give different  benefits to both parties. The main benefits to companies are: recruitment opportunities; PR  marketing and publicity, showing the company’s excellence in cybersecurity; networking  opportunities through meeting senior staff from other companies — including through the  competition — government and academia; opportunities to display thought leadership; a way to  demonstrate support of the government strategy; and showcasing training provision. The main  benefits to the challenge are a balance of finance to run the business and value in kind, which varies  from developing and running a competition to hosting the  Cyber Security Challenge UK website or  hosting one of its networking events. The platinum sponsors form an advisory board that advises the  Cyber Security Challenge Board on the development of the business.  Government sponsors the challenge for many of the same reasons as the private sector. It recruits  from amongst its candidates. The British government’s cybersecurity strategy has a strong emphasis  on developing cybersecurity skills and capability and names Cyber Security Challenge as one of the  ways of helping to fill the cybersecurity skills gap. It also recognises that its activities support other  government cyberobjectives like raising security awareness.  Academia is developing more courses that include or are centred on cybersecurity and is working  with business and government. Academics have also welcomed links to their local business  communities.  ‘SMEs are under attack from hackers, but where do you go to ensure that you are more secure?  There is a massive shortage of new recruits to the cybermarket. The potential recruits are there, and  often in unrelated roles such as heating engineers and postmen. The challenge is to find them, train  them and bring them into the cyber workplace. By sponsoring the Cyber Security Challenge you can  ensure that such potential recruits are identified and given a chance. In this way you help to fill the  cyberskills gap and ensure that there is expertise available that can protect you and your  organisation.’ Tony McDowell — Encryption  Cybersecurity competitions — the status in Europe  October 2014  Page  23  2.7 Other type of private platforms: Symantec Cyber Readiness Challenge  The Symantec Cyber Readiness Challenge is a cyberexercise platform designed to educate and  inform IT security professionals as well as common IT users through exciting, informative and  immersive user experiences in real-world, challenging events. The goal is to allow participants to test  their security knowledge in a safe educational environment, and to apply their learning in their daily  jobs to protect their people and information.  The challenge is a live penetration simulation, inspired by real-life security issues to help  organisations understand the vulnerabilities in today’s global threat landscape and ultimately gain  critical security intelligence to improve their skills, knowledge and security posture. It is designed for  all levels of technical expertise. It puts participants in the role of a penetration tester trying to  understand the attackers’ targets, technology and thought processes so they can ultimately better  protect their own organisation.  This interactive ‘capture-the-flag’-style competition is built along Symantec’s five stages of a typical  cyber breach (reconnaissance, incursion, discovery, capture and exfiltration) and leverages  Symantec’s leading-edge security intelligence. The exercise gives participants the opportunity to test  their abilities within a unique and realistic environment and, in particular, to sharpen their security  skills, expand their security awareness, implement their theoretical knowledge and compete against  peers, all in a sandboxed environment.  There are a number of variations in how the exercise can be conducted, with the shortest scenario  lasting no more than 2 hours, and the longest lasting for 4 to 5 full days. The level of detail of the  corresponding scenarios varies accordingly, involving a variety of events and practices common to  many cyberincidents and attacks. These may range from traditional penetration testing through the  exploitation of lost and found devices all the way to full-scale industrial espionage operations  involving intrusion and privilege escalation into IT systems, as well as the stealthy infiltration and  maintenance of advanced persistent threats.  This several-hour immersion, accessible for all IT skill levels, allows each participant to develop their  understanding of how security breaches can happen. The self-paced learning environment setting  tasks of varying difficulty and the guided gameplay set-up supported by a hinting system create an  ideal setting for participants to put their theoretical knowledge into practice in a safe environment,  learn how an attacker thinks, experience how systems are compromised, and asses their security  posture through a new lens. Each participant will be issued with a Continuous Professional Education  (CPE) Verification of Attendance that may be used to attest the completion of training assignments  or requirements. They will also receive individual performance reports based on how far and how  quickly they have progressed through the chosen scenario. After its development and pilot testing  phases completed in the course of 2012–13, the Symantec Cyber Readiness Challenge platform is  now established so as to be able to support multiple different scenarios across the Europe–Middle  East–Africa (EMEA) region. It can be accessed in multiple ways, remotely via a VPN connection or in  person, or even both simultaneously. Leveraging Symantec’s deep security knowledge to replicate  realistic situations, the platform is designed to educate and challenge participants of all technical  abilities with individual feedback. Depending on participants’ requirements, the platform is able to  support the co-development of further tailored scenarios.  Exercises using this platform can be run simultaneously in different locations, accommodating up to  1 000 participants, and they are underpinned by continuous remote IT support from Symantec  throughout the challenge. Additional features include the option of webcasting the start of the  exercise. The platform is purposely designed to be accessible even by users with only modest or  average IT equipment. The minimum technical requirements for network connectivity and for  Cybersecurity competitions — the status in Europe  October 2014  Page  24  participants’ machines are so designed as to accommodate most commonly used hardware and  software configurations without any difficulty. Even laptops that are several years old may be used,  as long as the VPN software used for the exercise and the latest version of Java can be installed on  them, and provided that sufficient network connectivity is available.  The platform was tested successfully in October 2013 with ENISA across different EU Member  States, using a specific scenario relevant to the participating EU institutions. This fruitful experience  is now available for replication (20) in 2014.  3. How to organise a challenge  ‘Hacker contest’ or more?: an Austrian perspective.  Our society is filled with digital lifelines — growing with a terrifying speed and density, which we can  only partly comprehend. For information technology, the limited space in the datacentre has  become far too cramped and ‘IT’ surrounds us in our everyday life much more than we like to  accept. Luckily people are also developing, slowly but surely, a certain awareness that these great  opportunities also include plenty of risks for everybody. This topic has been given a lot of attention  at security conferences. The ‘human’ factor is above all when it comes to potential risk in  combination with most risk management systems, be it as user or offender. In addition, the  availability of sufficient qualified personnel or ‘human capital’ receives plenty of attention.  The ‘war for talents’ — also known as the battle for high achievers — is not a real innovation. Many  educational institutions orientate their portfolios to the demands of ‘information and security  experts’. Considering this development, the question arises of the extent to which ‘hacker contests’  are not just circus acts. Do the operating ‘nerds’ have a legal exhibition on the border of the law?  These ‘outsiders’, with no apparent rules and their own culture, can have a moment of public glory.  Prejudices [against them] have been established due to one-sided and wrong news coverage. Are  they ready to take a step into the spotlight? There are legimate reasons to think about all these  questions (which are mainly due to stereotypes), but they are concealing more important facts.  When officers of the federal criminal police in lower Austria managed in April 2012 to arrest the  ‘hacker’ with the nickname ‘ACK13STX’, who had hacked several hundred companies in the period  from January to March of that year, they were pretty impressed to discover that the criminal was  only 15 years old. They were similar surprised by his reasoning. He said he was bored, wanted  attention and media coverage about ‘hacker’ attacks — similar to those from Anonymous. These and  comparable motives can be found in the statements of many other young ‘hackers’.  This youthful need for admiration encounters unchallenged and irresponsible media-hyped demand.  A search on Google for ‘16 year old hacker’ yielded more than 57 000 results. This very case  convinced the board of Cyber Security Austria to concentrate more on the topic of ‘up-and-coming  hackers’. It quickly became clear that there was a lack of consciousness of, and consequently missing  opportunities and structures for, talented young people. This leads them to feel left alone with their  skills, maybe stigmatised or, at best, slightly smiled at. In most cases, they just feel misunderstood by  their environment. It’s no wonder that many of them seek attention on different paths, and search  online for people similar to themselves.  The consequences for society are crucial and far more extensive than had been expected. It is  comparable to the missing awareness and structures in athletic sports that could lead to losing out  (20) Interested organisations are invited to contact Symantec’s Brussels office to discuss terms and conditions, technical requirements,  scheduling options, scenario planning and logistical arrangements: Mr Ilias Chantzos Tel. , Global Critical Infrastructure Protection  and Privacy Advisor, Senior Director Government Affairs, EMEA Symantec, Medialaan 38, 1800 Vilvoorde, Belgium, e-mail  ilias_chantzos@symantec.com  mailto:ilias_chantzos@symantec.com  Cybersecurity competitions — the status in Europe  October 2014  Page  25  on a potential 8 seconds runner for the 100-metre sprint. That the opposite is also possible can be  seen from Austria’s dominance in winter sports. Professional structures were built at all levels at a  very early stage, which led to a strict and hard selection process but enabled Austria to rank as one  of the top nations in these sports. IT, and knowledge around its safe and secure use, is not yet  acknowledged in public consciousness as a sport like skiing, but we know that we are much more  reliant on IT than on the more popular winter sports. However, the comparison is perfect to  illustrate the topic and intentions of the Cyber Security Challenge. The challenge is aimed at  becoming the spearhead for sustainable structures that enable society to recognise young people  who possess the necessary talent and interest. These ‘rising stars’ can then be encouraged and  invested in, for as long as ordinary schooling cannot support these structures.  A European cybersecurity challenge should accomplish an array of functions.  For young people with a special set of skills:   the possibility to prove those special skills;   the possibility to compare themselves with peers (benchmarking);   as a focal point and stage for young people and as a ‘positive’ network, where specialists  from theory, science and business can communicate;   as an awareness and appreciation platform to get rid of stigmas — the challenge should  also prove the environment of the participants how useful and important those skills  are;   to realise their skills and how they can use these in a responsible and ethical way;   to adapt to their abilities and communicate them in a customised environment;   to get excellent perspectives from an economic, commercial and social point of view;  For business and public authorities:   the chance to identify, encourage and develop young talents, build up a pool of talents and  encourage their selective growth;   the availability of highly qualified trainees;   the possibility to position themselves positively for those young talents, which otherwise  cannot be reached via the classic job market;   proof of performance for local talents (benchmarking), with the results of the challenge  allowing detailed comparisons;   ‘fingerprinting’ to get a clear picture of the qualifications of youth in the area of computer  security, more specifically the skills to intrude a computer system;   realising available capacities;   an event analogous to other large sporting event (Olympic Games or World Cups) to create a  specific awareness and to enthuse young people about information technology;  Cybersecurity competitions — the status in Europe  October 2014  Page  26  For schools, universities of applied science, other universities and educational institutions:   to position themselves as educational platforms for talented students;   to proof the performance level of their own pupils or students;   to get more young people interested in computer security — to create an awareness of  the topic of security;   to draw conclusions regarding education, science and theory.  The challenge is also beneficial for the media and society, giving them, for example, the rare chance  to get a ‘hacker’ live in action. The challenge also shows that although ‘hackers’ may have a  mysterious and forbidding aura, they are just ordinary people with a special set of skills. These skills  are not only about misuse for criminal activities, contrary to what the majority of the population  thinks.  This is why it is important not to compare all ‘hackers’ with offenders. ‘Hackers’ have a special ability  to think beyond the boundaries of existing systems. Therefore, they use not referred properties and  functions made by the ‘designer’, to utilise different purposes. With this they show that the  functionality of systems always depends on the will and intention of the user. The intention that  people have to adapt to the technical systems is doomed on the long run. The ones to survive on the  long-term are those which are accepted and find a reasonable benefit.  To sum up we would add several general considerations.   It makes sense to coordinate a European challenge with local partners — otherwise the  overheads for running a European Cyber Security Challenge (ECSC) might become inefficient.   ENISA should provide support in the form of clear guidelines, a European corporate identity,  know-how, suggestions, White Papers and, if possible, resources (personnel and money) and  a clear goal — about what is expected.   The ECSC could be just a ‘free’ European comparison between different countries — but it  probably makes sense to have a closer look at other successful ‘working’ European  challenges — like the UEFA Champions League, for example. The winner of a national  competition qualifies to participate in the Champions League — where the ‘rules of the  game’ are equal and the same for all participating soccer clubs in Europe — which makes it  comparable! This comparability is an important element in the basic idea of competition, on  the one hand, and on the other hand it makes the challenge more attractive for the  Economy to support this challenge and find highly talented young people.   The regional approach deployed of Austria, Germany and Switzerland may provide an  example.   It make sense to coordinate the local competition between one or several public institutions,  schools and universities, companies and associations. The combination of different  stakeholders might also be a very important factor in organising this local challenge —  because this combination provides the best coverage of potential pupils and students as well  as all other supporting stakeholders. But probably it makes sense also to discuss a European  prequalification which might be assisted and organised by the local players. It is not  important what kind of solutions — such as ‘capture the flag’ or equal or open exercises like  Cybersecurity competitions — the status in Europe  October 2014  Page  27  ‘hacking labs’ — are used in the local competitions or qualifications, as long as there is  transparency about what systems might be used at the finals in a European challenge. But  there are some advantages in running an equal system in the local (pre)qualification  competitions as well.   Because there are different school systems in different European countries, it makes more  sense to divide potential participants groups by age e.g.probably 14–18, 18–30 years etc.   ENISA should encourage the local organisers to run an additional programme — called a  centre of excellence (CoE) or some other name — which supports the young talents with  different services, exercises, excursions and other ‘tokens’ to enforce the network between  them, as well the network between them and the economy, public institutions and the  education sector.  4. Guidelines for a pan-European cyberchallenge competition  In this chapter we unfold the considerations in organising a pan-European cyberchallenge  competition for students, from general information to some specifics steps foward.  The goal is to promote cyberchallenges as a focal point for:   awareness of the need for cybersecurity and threat intelligence;   benchmarking for young people, in schools or universities, and among lifelong learners;   the early discovery of young people with a talent for IT security;   understanding of the range and diversity of jobs in cyber security;   the development of structures to sustain IT security excellence in the education sector;   the attraction of IT and IT security for young people;   national and European networks of excellence and establishing professional IT security  excellence in Europe.  Target audience  The audience is made up of two levels, firstly policymakers who have the decision-making power and  influence to lead their societies towards progress and new technologies, with citizens with high ICT  skills, and, secondly, digital users, primarily students, who may get involved and develop IT  expertise. Some of the advantages that we envisage are:   the early discovery of young people with a talent for IT security;   the fingerprinting of IT security skills of pupils and students;   the additional promotion and training of skills (through centres of excellence);   the professional development of young people with high potential;   fostering of networking between themselves and peer-to-peer education;   the provision of a clear signal to the social environment of young ‘hackers’ — we need this  know-how!;   deploy a legal environment, where skills can be developed and links made with those in  cyber security jobs, to inspire and divert to socially useful jobs those who might otherwise  be attracted to criminality;  Cybersecurity competitions — the status in Europe  October 2014  Page  28   making them understand their potential and opportunities as well as their social  responsibility.  Cybersecurity competitions — the status in Europe  October 2014  Page  29  Context  Furthermore, after the exchange of information from the workshop organised in April, we have  noted the following points.   There are several well-established competitions in Europe and we should take their  experiences into account.   Private organisations have developed different platforms that can be a good starting point  for the pan-European platform.   A future pan-European security challenge will be developed as follows.  a. Based on the EU cybersecurity strategy, the first target audience will be university  students and therefore the focus for the 2015 cyberchallenge will be on universities.  b. In 2015, this publicly available report is the first document with guidelines for  organising a pan-European challenge.  c. In 2015, the language of the competition will be English , and if further funding  becomes available French and German will be added.  d. The Cyber Challenge Organising Committee is going to launch several calls,  including:   a call for platform providers;   a call for general involvement;   a call for sponsors.  e. The European Cyber Challenge Competition will be organised in the fourth quarter  of 2015.  Cybersecurity competitions — the status in Europe  October 2014  Page  30  5. Conclusions  With this report,  a milestone in this challenging initiative has been reached. We have identified the  experienced players in European countries, established contact, organised the first workshop in  Brussels, and published a common document as result of a highly collaborative process during 2014.  The stage is set for an ambitious deployment of the pan-European Cyber Security  Challenge Competition!  Furthermore, we would like to underline the importance of the European Commission’s active  involvement in getting on board policymakers in the Member States, the expertise of the EU’s  cybersecurity agency, ENISA,  in involving the best experts in the field and the responsibility of public  and private stakeholder in understanding that the target is set very high and that they should engage  to the best of their ability.  The European Cyber Security Challenge Competition is set to be the result of a  public–private partnership with capable players and focused to change for the  better the ICT educational approach that digital citizens in Europe receive.

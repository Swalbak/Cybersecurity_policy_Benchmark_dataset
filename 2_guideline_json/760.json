The ACSC has developed this guide to assist Australian’s to understand the risks when deploying Samsung Galaxy S10  and S20 devices. It details the security requirements that allow Samsung Galaxy platforms to handle sensitive or  classified data. This security configuration guide does not replace the Information Security Manual (ISM). However,  where a technical conflict arises organisations should asses their risk using both documents.  Audience  This guide is for users and administrators of Samsung Galaxy platform. These devices include S10, S20 and Note 20  mobile device series, procured within the Australian market. Note that the above models have relied on prior ASD  Cryptographic Evaluation (ACE) program results to assess risks.  To use this guide, readers should be familiar with basic networking concepts, be an experienced mobile device system  administrator and be or have access to an experienced network administrator.  Parts of this guide reference product features that will require the deployment of additional networking equipment or  Mobile Device Management (MDM) software. While every effort has been made to ensure content involving any third- party vendor products is correct at the time of writing, organisations should always check with their vendor when  planning their system implementation. Note, mention of third-party products is not an endorsement of that vendor  over another and has been used to illustrate desirable features.  Some security configuration instructions within this guide are complex, and if implemented incorrectly could reduce the  security of devices, networks or an organisation’s overall security posture. These instructions should be implemented  by experienced systems administrators and should be used in conjunction with thorough testing.  Purpose  This guide provides information for Australian organisations on the security of Samsung Galaxy devices sold in Australia,  and their risks, which require consideration before they are introduced into an organisation’s mobile fleet.  This guide provides a summary of features and associated risks for the Samsung Galaxy S10, S20 and Note 20.  Throughout this guide, devices and combinations of software are collectively referred to as the ‘Samsung Galaxy  platform’.  The advice in this guide has been written for the use of the Galaxy platform within Australia and its territories.  Organisations and individuals seeking to use devices outside Australia should refer to the ACSC’s Travelling Overseas  With Electronic Devices publication.  Implementing the settings provided in this guide can significantly impact system functionality and user experience.  Authorising officers are encouraged to consider the balance of user requirements and security, as not all advice may be  appropriate for every user, environment or deployment.  Organisations should seek approval from their authorising officer to allow for the formal acceptance of the residual  risks. Refer to the applying a risk-based approach to cyber security section of the ISM for more information.  Finally, this guide reflects the ISM. Although, not all ISM requirements can be implemented on the Samsung Galaxy  platform. In these cases, risk mitigation measures are provided in the Advice to authorising officers section.  The Security Configuration Guide contains feature summaries and risk considerations of the Samsung Galaxy platform  as listed in Table 1. These devices use the Exynos mobile processor and run Samsung Knox 3.6 or higher and Android  10.0 or higher.  https://www.cyber.gov.au/resources-business-and-government/essential-cyber-security/ism https://www.cyber.gov.au/resources-business-and-government/maintaining-devices-and-systems/remote-working-and-secure-mobility/secure-mobility/travelling-overseas-electronic-devices https://www.cyber.gov.au/resources-business-and-government/maintaining-devices-and-systems/remote-working-and-secure-mobility/secure-mobility/travelling-overseas-electronic-devices  2  Series S10e S10 S10+ S20 S20+  S20  Ultra  Note 20  Note 20  Ultra  S20 FE  4G SM- G970F  SM- G973F  SM- G975F  SM- G980F  SM- G985F  N/A N/A N/A G780F  5G N/A SM- G977B  N/A SM- G981B  SM- G986B  SM- G988B  SM- N980B  SM- N986B  G781B  Evaluation status  Since April 2014, ASD endorsed the Mobile Device Fundamentals Protection Profile  (MDFPP), with specified  additional mitigations, as a key component in all mobile device evaluations. The MDFPP, as defined by the United States  National Information Assurance Partnership (NIAP), outlines the security requirements for a mobile device for use in an  enterprise. Earlier versions of Samsung Galaxy platform have been evaluated against MDFPP and completed an ASD  Cryptographic Evaluation (ACE) in 2018.  This guide is based on the findings of ASD and provides guidance that must be enforced for OFFICIAL: Sensitive and  PROTECTED deployments. Guidance in this publication will also assist organisations to comply with existing policies  when deploying devices at lower classifications.  Samsung also has additional security information for their devices.  https://www.niap-ccevs.org/Profile/Info.cfm?PPID=468&id=468 https://www.samsung.com/au/security  3  General advice  When new versions of Samsung Galaxy platform Operating System (OS) are released, there is potential for the  introduction of changes that can have security implications. Authorising officers should seek additional guidance, if  required, when considering new versions. In the absence of additional guidance, ASD provides the following advice.   Upgrade to the latest version of the Samsung Galaxy platform OS as new versions provide security enhancements  and address known vulnerabilities. This is consistent with ASD advice to install the latest versions of software and  to patch operating system vulnerabilities as communicated in the ISM and the Strategies to Mitigate Cyber  Security Incidents.  Samsung and Google provide release notes regarding the content of Android security updates. This information can  help organisations quantify the risks if they do not update.  Introduction to mobile device security  In this guide, mobile device security advice centres on the three security tenets of:   device integrity   data at rest   data in transit.  ASD evaluates cryptographic implementations to determine the configurations necessary to reduce the handling  requirements of devices used for processing, storing or communicating sensitive or classified data. Each organisation is  responsible for configuring their devices according to ASD guidance, and ensure that available cryptographic  protections are appropriately configured.  Configuration advice regarding device integrity aims to provide a level of protection suitable for sensitive or classified  mobile devices. It assumes an adversary may have physical access to device while it is powered on and in a locked state.  Configuration advice draws upon an assessment of:   key hierarchy and architecture   cryptographic implementation   operating system architecture   configuration under typical deployment scenarios.  Configuration advice regarding the protection of data at rest aims to provide a level of protection suitable for sensitive  or classified data stored on Samsung Galaxy platform. ASD advice assumes an adversary may have physical access to a  device while it is powered on and in a locked state. Configuration advice draws upon technical assessment and details  of application implementations, including availability of security features.  Configuration advice regarding the protection of data in transit aims to provide a suitable level of protection for  sensitive or classified data traversing a network. It assumes an adversary is able to intercept this traffic. Each  organisation is responsible for configuring their devices according to ASD guidance and maintaining appropriate Virtual  Private Network (VPN) infrastructure to support VPN tunnels. Noting such supporting infrastructure is out of scope for  this guide.  Samsung Knox Platform for Enterprise  Extending the security of the native Android operating system, Samsung Knox Platform for Enterprise (KPE) provides  additional security features to Samsung Galaxy platform devices at a hardware and software level.  https://www.cyber.gov.au/resources-business-and-government/essential-cyber-security/strategies-mitigate-cyber-security-incidents https://www.cyber.gov.au/resources-business-and-government/essential-cyber-security/strategies-mitigate-cyber-security-incidents  4  Samsung Galaxy platform leverage hardware features coupled with Knox software to verify that the device boot chain is  not compromised and tampering has not occurred. Samsung Galaxy S20 and Note 20 devices provide additional  security through a ‘secure element’ chip which further extends the ability of Knox to perform hardware verification and  provide secure data storage.  Samsung Galaxy platforms with KPE use software to ensure compliance checks, provide encryption, and isolation of  applications.  Further information can be accessed from the Samsung Knox Platform for Enterprise (KPE) guide .  Data protection  The Samsung Galaxy platform supports Samsung’s On-Device Encryption and Sensitive Data Protection (SDP), which  provide hardware backed encryption for data-at-rest. Two levels of protection; ‘Protected Data’ and ‘Sensitive Data’ are  provided by the system. This is not to be confused with the PROTECTED or OFFICIAL: Sensitive classification levels:   Protected Data: This is the default level of protection for every file inside the work profile. Cryptographic keys are  not evicted from memory at work profile lock; they stay in memory until the device is powered off.   Sensitive Data: Applications must specifically mark files as Knox Sensitive Data, or place the files into the Chamber  directory which encrypts the contents with SDP. Cryptographic keys are evicted from memory at work profile lock,  and data is only accessible when the work profile is unlocked.  Additional information is available from the Samsung Knox Platform for Enterprise (KPE) guide and the Sensitive  Data Protection whitepapers.  The encryption deployed by the Samsung Galaxy platform is optionally DualDAR, which means the data is encrypted in  two layers when Android Enterprise Work Profiles are enabled. The inner layer allows a third-party cryptographic  module to be installed and deployed. The default setting is a FIPS 140-2 certified cryptographic module. The outer layer  uses AES 256 XTS encryption and file encryption keys are encrypted through AES-GCM 256. Additional information is  available from the KPE white paper’s section on DualDAR.  Organisations deploying Samsung Galaxy platforms that handle PROTECTED level classified data, must ensure it is  stored as ‘Knox Sensitive Data’. SDP provides a sufficient mechanism for PROTECTED level classified data and is a key  requirement supporting the ability to reduce the handling requirements.  Applications that specifically opt-in to Knox SDP are authorised to store information classified as PROTECTED. When  selecting applications to run in the KPE at PROTECTED, the organisation must have assurance that all PROTECTED  information is stored within the SDP area.  https://docs.samsungknox.com/admin/knox-platform-for-enterprise/welcome.htm https://docs.samsungknox.com/admin/knox-platform-for-enterprise/welcome.htm https://docs.samsungknox.com/admin/whitepaper/kpe/sensitive-data-protection.htm https://docs.samsungknox.com/admin/whitepaper/kpe/sensitive-data-protection.htm  5  Application Container  Applications and associated data can be securely isolated using the Android Enterprise work profile.  The Android Enterprise Work Profile creates a secure container on the device using encryption. When applications are  running inside the work profile, they are cryptographically separated from the base device storage. Applications  running inside the Android Enterprise work profile are separate instances to ones outside of the work profile.  KPE also has a storage area inside the work profile called ‘Chamber’, which marks all files with SDP that are stored  within the directory. SDP offers stronger security when compared to the default Samsung Protected Data encryption.  Further details are available from the ‘Chamber’ section in the Samsung admin guide.  MDM enrolled devices  ASD guidance advises that devices handling sensitive or classified data (OFFICIAL: Sensitive and above) be MDM  enrolled. MDM enrolment manages KPE, as outlined later in this guide. MDM enrolment of devices handling sensitive  or classified data is necessary to ensure that the correct policies and configurations are applied throughout the lifecycle  of devices. Organisations will need to register their devices with Samsung to access KPE. For high-risk implementations,  and cases where registering with Samsung is neither desirable nor technically feasible, advice may be sought from ASD.  Individuals wishing to utilise Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) must consider the need for enrolment with an  organisations MDM. MDM enrolment provides control and remote wipe functionality of devices within their  organisation. Therefore, a detailed discussion about the need for BYOD should be held between the user and  authorising officer, with appropriate policy developed to support this requirement.  Samsung Knox Premium licence  In order to securely configure Samsung Galaxy platform in accordance with this guide, organisations will be required to  purchase a KPE Premium licence from a Samsung Knox reseller. Once obtained, the KPE Premium licence must be  loaded into an MDM, and enable KPE functionality.  https://docs.samsungknox.com/admin/knox-platform-for-enterprise/about-data-protection.htm https://docs.samsungknox.com/admin/knox-platform-for-enterprise/about-data-protection.htm https://docs.samsungknox.com/Knox-Premium-Getting-Started/Content/premium-intro.htm  6  Advice to authorising officers  ACSC has developed the Strategies to Mitigate Cyber Security Incidents  to help organisations and their authorising  officers mitigate cyber security incidents caused by various cyber threats. The most effective of these mitigation  strategies are known as the Essential Eight. While the strategies were developed for workstations and servers, much of  this is applicable to modern smartphones.  Samsung Galaxy platform and the Essential Eight  Application control   When configured in accordance with ASD guidance, the Samsung Galaxy platform only implement application  controls that are enforced via an application’s package name.   The Samsung Galaxy platform offers no granular configuration, such that applications can be controlled based on  specific versions or via package hashes (a unique cryptographic fingerprint for an application version). This level of  control must be provided through a managed app store.   Therefore it is not advisable to allow the Samsung Galaxy platform that have access to PROTECTED information to  interact with unmanaged rich application ecosystems, such as the Google Play Store or Samsung Galaxy App  Store, or permit configuration such that applications can be installed from unknown sources. For environments  where apps that are not part of the platform are required, a managed app store should be utilised to control the  apps available on the device with the needed granular control. These conditions ensure that only approved  applications are allowed to run on the devices.  Patch applications   When configured in accordance with this guidance, the Samsung Galaxy platform receives patches to applications  as soon as they are available.   It is recommended that user education is provided so that users understand the necessity to update applications  when prompted by the device.   Organisations can leverage their MDM to measure compliance with this control.  Configure Microsoft Office macro settings   Currently, Microsoft Office for Android does not support high-risk features such as Microsoft Office macros.   New versions of Microsoft Office for Android may introduce macro functionality. Authorising officers will need to  reassess of their exposure to this risk.  User application hardening   When configured in accordance with ASD guidance, the Samsung Galaxy platform do not display or run Adobe  Flash content. Samsung Galaxy platform is configured to not allow Java to execute or to allow pop-ups; however,  these settings can be manually disabled by the user.  Restrict administrative privileges   When configured in accordance with this guidance, the Samsung Galaxy platform is managed by an MDM solution  and performs self-attestation checks to ensure the correct permissions are set and enforced.  https://www.cyber.gov.au/resources-business-and-government/essential-cyber-security/strategies-mitigate-cyber-security-incidents  7   Authorising officers are encouraged to ensure that the MDM fully supports the security features recommended in  this guide.  Patch operating systems   Samsung have recently announced that the Samsung Galaxy platform will receive Android operating system  updates for ‘up-to’ three generations of flagship devices.   The Samsung Galaxy platform is an Android-based ecosystem; consequently, there are many stakeholders  involved in the patching lifecycle for the OS. These include: Google’s Android Open Source Project (AOSP),  Samsung and Australian telecommunications network providers. Organisations shall ensure that users are advised  to apply operating system software updates when prompted.   Organisations can leverage their MDM to measure compliance with this control.  Multi-factor authentication   When configured in accordance with this guidance, the user is initially authenticated locally on the Samsung  Galaxy platform, and then mutual authentication is then performed through Remote Server infrastructure (e.g.  MDM, VPN) using usernames, passwords and certificates. While this is not a traditional model for multi-factor  authentication, the useability and security considerations are appropriately satisfied for the intent of the  mitigation strategy.  Daily backups   When configured in accordance with ASD guidance, the Samsung Galaxy platform does not allow for backup of  government information.   If the mobile device is only used to access corporate data hosted on remote servers such as email, the  requirement to backup handset data is reduced to the configuration required to rebuild the device, such as those  hosted in an MDM.   Organisations considering the use of third party or custom backup applications should investigate the risk to  government information.  8  Samsung Galaxy platform feature summary and  risk considerations  Work profile  OFFICIAL: Sensitive PROTECTED  Required Required  Risks  The work profile is the only logical storage area that meets the requirements to handle OFFICIAL: Sensitive or  PROTECTED data. The work profile can provide suitable encryption and key management. Users must be trained in how  to store information inside the Chamber appropriately, data stored outside the Chamber or without SDP does not have  the suitable key management or encryption required to handle sensitive or classified data.  When using applications inside the work profile, organisations should assess the Android Package capabilities against  the Knox SDK to ensure that required functionality is supported by the application.  In order to downgrade the handling requirements of Samsung Galaxy platform containing sensitive or classified data,  the work profile must be locked. Set the work profile lock to the device lock screen in order to appropriately clear  ephemeral keys from device memory.  Work profile passcode  OFFICIAL: Sensitive PROTECTED  Organisation decision Required  Risks  The security of the work profile is limited by the strength of the Samsung Galaxy platform and work profile passcodes. If  these passcodes can be guessed or brute-forced, all information stored on the device could be compromised.  The biometric mechanisms of the Samsung Galaxy platform have not undergone an ACE, and the security claims of the  feature are difficult to assess. The use of biometrics to protect sensitive or classified data is an organisation risk decision  for OFFICIAL: Sensitive deployments, however, must not be used when the device handles PROTECTED data.  It is recommended that two unique passwords be used to unlock the handset and work profile. Personal Identification  Number (PIN) codes, pattern/swipe codes and built-in biometric sensors should not be used. Deployments of Samsung  Galaxy platform using biometrics should consider the practicality and privacy of users, and tailor advice surrounding  these features to best suit the deployment scenario. Authorising officers should seek ASD guidance where a  requirement for biometrics is identified.  The organisation should set and enforce policies in accordance with the ISM. Additional information can be found  under the ‘Single-factor authentication’ topic in the ISM.  9  Device passcode  OFFICIAL: Sensitive PROTECTED  Organisation decision Required  Risks  The security of the device is limited by the strength of the passcode. If this passcode can be guessed or brute-forced, all  information stored on the device could be accessed.  It is recommended to use a unique password or passphrase to unlock the device. PIN codes, pattern/swipe codes and  built-in biometric sensors should not be used. The biometric mechanisms of the Samsung Galaxy platform have not  undergone an ACE, and the security claims of the feature are difficult to assess. The use of biometrics to protect  sensitive or classified data is an organisation risk decision for OFFICIAL: Sensitive deployments. Biometrics must not be  used when the device handles PROTECTED data.  The organisation should set and enforce policies in accordance with the ISM. Additional information can be found  under the ‘Single-factor authentication’ topic in the ISM.  Non-native applications inside the work profile  OFFICIAL: Sensitive PROTECTED  Organisation decision Organisation decision  Risks  Applications that do not handle sensitive or classified data appropriately or afford a suitable level of encryption are at  risk of disclosing or mishandling sensitive or classified data.  Native applications are applications that come pre-installed on the device. Non-native applications can be third-party or  applications developed in-house within an organisation.  In approving an application for use within KPE, organisations should conduct a rigorous assessment of that application.  This should include determining whether sensitive or classified data is appropriately handled within the work profile  and Chamber, such that SDP is appropriately applied in line with ASD guidance.  Not allowing applications other than approved applications prevents compromise of sensitive or classified data stored  inside the work profile. Applications should be assessed in detail before being allowed to run inside a work profile that  contains sensitive or classified data. Applications should not be installed inside the work profile without a genuine need  for access to sensitive or classified data.  Additional information can be found under the ‘Application hardening’ section in the ISM.  Non-native applications outside the work profile  OFFICIAL: Sensitive PROTECTED  Organisation decision Not recommended  10  Risks  Android applications may contain functionality that contravenes an organisations policy. Functionality may be hidden  and able to be remotely updated causing impacts to user privacy, experience and security. The Android security model  does not provide sufficiently granular control of applications to provide assurance that an application is trusted and  unmodified.  The work profile provides appropriate protections, when configured in accordance with this guide, to defend against  applications from outside the work profile. While it is possible to install non-native applications outside of the work  profile this can inadvertently introduce additional risks.  For PROTECTED deployments, where the authorising officer has accepted use of non-native applications outside of the  work profile, the application must never handle PROTECTED data or interact with applications within the work profile.  Non-native applications should not be installed on devices, handling PROTECTED data and in cases where the  application has not been approved by the organisations authorising officer.  Additional information can be found under the ‘Application hardening’ section in the ISM.  Mobile Device Management  OFFICIAL: Sensitive PROTECTED  Required Required  Risks  Without an MDM, devices may not comply with an organisation’s approved configuration and/or audit requirements.  MDM solutions are important configuration and deployment tools for mobile devices, providing security features,  management and logging functionality. Devices that handle sensitive or classified data, whether BYOD or provided by  the organisation, must enrol in an MDM that is configured in line with ASD guidance and allow the MDM to be a device  administrator.  A core functionality of an MDM is the ability to remotely disable and/or wipe lost or stolen devices, and perform fleet- wide compliance checks against required controls.  Organisations operating in higher risk situations are encouraged to engage with ASD when developing and  implementing their MDM solution.  Additional information can be found under the ‘Mobile Device Management’ topic in the ISM.  Mobile Application Management  OFFICIAL: Sensitive PROTECTED  Recommended Required  Risks  Using Mobile Application Management (MAM) allows an organisation to vet and deploy applications without needing  to enable high risk installation processes such as by unknown sources and public app stores. MAM also provides a  platform for organisations to deploy application updates without requiring access to public app stores.  11  MAM servers (usually as part of an MDM solution) are important tools for deploying privately developed applications to  devices.  If organisations have permitted non-native applications on a PROTECTED device a MAM is required. For deployments  that do not require non-native applications, there is no requirement for a MAM solution.  Additional information can be found under the ‘Mobile Device Management’ topic in the ISM.  Bring Your Own Device  OFFICIAL: Sensitive PROTECTED  Organisation decision Not permitted  Risks  BYODs have a higher risk of inadvertently introducing risk into an organisation’s mobile deployment. They are at higher  risk of infection with malicious applications or software before MDM configuration is applied to make them suitable for  handling sensitive or classified data. Organisations should perform a risk assessment before allowing privately-owned  devices onto their networks.  A deployment can include BYOD when the devices are enrolled in an MDM and appropriately configured for handling  OFFICIAL: Sensitive. It is not permitted to use BYOD for PROTECTED deployments.  Additional information can be found under the ‘Privately-owned mobile devices’ topic in the ISM and in the ACSC’s Risk  Management of Enterprise Mobility Including Bring Your Own Device  publication.  Virtual Private Network  OFFICIAL: Sensitive PROTECTED  Required Required  Risks  A Virtual Private Network (VPN) can provide data-in-transit protection between organisations devices and a trusted  gateway.  Samsung Galaxy platform implementation of VPN permits some data to transit outside of the VPN. ASD has observed  some plain-text (unencrypted) device identifying information outside of the VPN, even in an Always On configuration.  This may introduce additional risk is certain deployment scenarios.  All data communications for the Samsung Galaxy platform handling sensitive or classified data must be through the  Always On ‘StrongSwan’ VPN. The Samsung Galaxy platform offers two versions of VPN client – OpenVPN and  StrongSwan. The StrongSwan client is enforced via the kernel and therefore offers a stronger security claim for the VPN  tunnel.  Addition information can be found under the ‘Connecting mobile devices to the internet’ topic in the ISM.  https://www.cyber.gov.au/resources-business-and-government/maintaining-devices-and-systems/remote-working-and-secure-mobility/secure-mobility/risk-management-enterprise-mobility-including-bring-your-own-device https://www.cyber.gov.au/resources-business-and-government/maintaining-devices-and-systems/remote-working-and-secure-mobility/secure-mobility/risk-management-enterprise-mobility-including-bring-your-own-device  12  Unknown software sources  OFFICIAL: Sensitive PROTECTED  Not recommended Not permitted  Risks  Samsung Galaxy platform deployments that allow unknown sources have less control over the applications that can be  loaded, this introduces additional risk to the platform.  The use of a MDM and/or a MAM can allow the controlled installation of privately developed applications without the  requirement to enable unknown sources.  Refer to the Self-assessment of non-native applications section in this guide, in addition, refer to the ‘Application  hardening’ and ‘Mobile device management’ sections in the ISM.  SDP-aware email applications running inside work profile  OFFICIAL: Sensitive PROTECTED  Organisation decision Required  Risks  SDP aware email applications offer appropriate protections for the encryption and handling of sensitive or classified  data up to PROTECTED. Mail client applications should be considered on a case-by-case basis.  If an email client does not support the application of protective security markings to emails, organisations should  consider configuring email servers to allow for manual protective marking of emails by users. Organisations should  consider whether to allow attachments to or from the Samsung Galaxy platform based upon the risks surrounding the  storage and handling of sensitive or classified data on the devices.  For SDP-aware email applications that run inside a work profile, such as the Samsung Mail Client, email headers may  not be handled in accordance with protective markings or appropriate encryption. Email clients may not apply  protective markings appropriately, introducing the risk that users may store email header information without  appropriate protections. Due to performance considerations, some email clients encrypt header information with the  Samsung Protected Data mechanism; as opposed to the Knox SDP.  Organisations should carefully consider the risks associated with the header information, and any potential impact this  would have on sensitive or classified data.  Authorising officers should be aware that the handling of attachments on mobile devices introduces risk. Risk includes  aggregation and the potential loss of control of the information, similar in risk to when sensitive or classified data is  printed in hardcopy form.  Organisations must deliver user training to ensure that users understand that attachments moved outside of the  application must be stored inside the Chamber directory, as the files are not encrypted by SDP when stored in other  locations.  Additional information can be found under the ‘Email usage’ section in the ISM.  13  Non-SDP aware email application running inside work profile  OFFICIAL: Sensitive PROTECTED  Not recommended Not permitted  Risks  The use of non-SDP aware email applications introduces a high degree of risk for sensitive or classified data due to the  lack of appropriate encryption mechanisms.  It is not recommended for OFFICIAL: Sensitive deployments and not permitted for PROTECTED deployments.  Email applications running outside work profile  OFFICIAL: Sensitive PROTECTED  Not recommended Not permitted  Risks  The use of email applications running outside of the work profile introduces a high degree of risk for sensitive or  classified data.  Email clients that run outside of Knox lack suitable encryption and key management attributes for attachments that can  be moved outside of the application.  Additional information can be found under the ‘Email usage’ section in the ISM.  Document preview running inside work profile  OFFICIAL: Sensitive PROTECTED  Organisation decision Organisation decision  Risks  Sensitive or classified data may be stored inappropriately after files are opened in a document preview application.  Viewing documents opens the file outside of the parent application, for example, outside the file explorer or mail client.  There is no guarantee of correct file handling, classification markings and encryption if these document preview  applications are used to save or edit files. While open, the Knox model still protects the file in memory; however, there  is considerable risk associated with saving or editing sensitive or classified data using document preview applications.  If organisations allow the use of document preview applications for sensitive or classified data, user training should be  provided to reduce the risk of inappropriate storage. Educating users in how to save files to Chamber where they are  encrypted with SDP would assist in reducing risk.  14  External storage  OFFICIAL: Sensitive PROTECTED  Organisation decision Not permitted  Risks  Any data stored or accessed on external or adoptable media will not be encrypted with SDP, and therefore such  external storage media is not suitable for sensitive or classified data. External media such as microSD cards should be  treated the same as external media, such as unapproved Universal Serial Bus (USB) storage, in a traditional desktop  computing environment.  Application control  OFFICIAL: Sensitive PROTECTED  Required Required  Risks  Applications are only compared against a list of approved applications at installation time. Therefore, applications could  be modified for malicious purposes after the list of approved applications has been checked.  With Android, a list of approved applications is defined via an MDM and enforces control of the installation of these  applications. Current Android versions control applications via package name or developer certificate, with most  common MDMs offering package name only control of applications. Knox has a capability to allow or deny applications  through Mobile Application Management (MAM).  Note, application control via developer certificate allows all applications signed with an approved developer’s  certificate to be installed.  Additional information can be found under the ‘Application hardening’ and ‘Mobile Device Management’ sections in  the ISM.  Backups  OFFICIAL: Sensitive PROTECTED  Organisation decision Organisation decision  Risks  Without regular backups, sensitive or classified data may be irrecoverable should only a local copy of the data exist and  become inaccessible. However, with unapproved backup solutions, sensitive or classified data may be extracted and  then stored on, or transit over, systems that are not suitable for the sensitivity or classification of the data.  Daily backups are recommended for all sensitive or classified data that is only held on the device. Currently there is not  an Android or Samsung implementation of automated backup from within the work profile. A backup process would  need to be manual or enabled by a non-native application.  15  If data of organisational value is being created on devices, careful application selection or development can negate the  need for organisational data to require backup explicitly from devices, because it is synchronised to servers implicitly  (such as using a Content Management System that has a client with a File Sharing Extension).  Additional information can be found under the ‘Data backup and restoration’ section in the ISM.  Microsoft Office for Android  OFFICIAL: Sensitive PROTECTED  Organisation decision Organisation decision  Risks  Android devices do not currently run Microsoft Office macros and therefore many of the risks associated with handling  Office documents are not relevant at this time. As this is a feature of a third-party vendor, continual monitoring of this  risk will need to be undertaken. The ability for Office for Android to expose the enterprise to macros should also be  considered when implementing mail gateway architectures. Additionally, users will require training in saving and  marking files appropriately for the Chamber in order to make use of the appropriate encryption for sensitive or  classified data, as provided by SDP.  Organisations looking to implement Microsoft Office for Android should refer to the ‘Application hardening’ section in  the ISM, and are encouraged to contact ASD to assess risks and deployment scenarios.  16  Mobile device administration  Managing mobile device security  MDM and MAM solutions are an integral part of implementing any smartphone solution for an organisation. Any  smartphone device that handles sensitive or classified data will require an appropriate MDM and MAM solution to  satisfy the security requirements outlined in this guide and the ISM. An organisation’s authorising officer, system  manager and risk owner should work together to select the best MDM and MAM solution for the organisation’s  implementation, while giving careful consideration to the functionality of the solution and its ability to meet the  requirements outlined in this guide and the ISM. Samsung publishes a list of MDM vendors that integrate with the  Samsung Galaxy platform, and the features that each MDM contains.  In order to deploy core Samsung security features, such as work profiles, organisations will require a KPE Premium key.  This key is distributed to Samsung Galaxy platform devices via an MDM, and allows an organisation to access and  implement the Samsung security features outlined in this guide. Samsung publish a list of resellers for the KPE premium  key on their website.  Purchasing and enrolling devices  It is important that organisations purchase smartphone devices within Australia, and only allow BYOD devices that were  purchased within Australia. Devices from other regions and/or with different model numbers have hardware, firmware  and software differences. These differences mean that the advice in this guide may not be directly applicable, and may  present risks not considered in this guide.  It is recommended to avoid purchasing second hand smartphone devices for enrolment in enterprise deployments.  Purchasing new will reduce the risk of obtaining a device which fails attestation.  Do not attempt to enrol devices which have been ‘rooted’, this includes BYOD deployment scenarios. Rooting allows  complete access to the underlying mobile operating system and removes important security controls.  Each MDM solution has its own way of enrolling devices, however the general theme for the Samsung Galaxy platform  is for a client application to be installed manually and configured to enrol the device into the MDM and associate the  device with a user. It is recommended that this enrolment process is undertaken before the devices are provided to an  end user, or in the case of BYODs, that enrolment is verified before the device is allowed to handle sensitive or  classified data. Devices should be enrolled into the MDM from within an organisation’s trusted network. MDM client  applications will need to be given the ‘Device Administrator’ permission. Once enrolled, the device will undergo self- attestation and make changes in accordance with the organisation’s policies and settings pushed via the MDM, with  any non-compliant devices reported through the MDM Administrator Console.  Revoking use, end of life and device disposal  An organisation may wish to consider the following to aid the development of processes and procedures when devices  are at end of life and are to be disposed of, or stop being used by an individual.  Sensitive or classified data  When devices are at the end of life and are to be disposed of, multiple decommissioning steps are required. When  sensitive or classified data has been stored on the device in accordance with the settings specified in the device  summary of this guide, for its entire life, un-enrolling from the MDM will result in the associated work profile  automatically being destroyed and the data deleted. A factory reset is still required to ensure all sensitive or classified  data is removed as per guidance in the ISM.  17  Revoking access  Credentials must be revoked from both the handset and the organisation’s remote infrastructure, such as VPN server  infrastructure. Should a user be reinstated, new credentials must be generated.  All remaining UNOFFICIAL data and accesses  When devices are at the end of life and are to be disposed of, a factory data reset is required. UNOFFICIAL data,  including personal data, contacts and accesses, may be removed before performing a reset. Additional utilities may aid  in further sanitisation of the device, at the organisation’s discretion.  Self-assessment of non-native applications  An organisation may wish to consider the following non-exhaustive list of issues to aid in a self-assessment of non- native applications:   Trusted developer: A developer with a history of producing quality and widely used applications is less likely to  have malicious components in their applications that would impact the security of the data that the application  handles.   Trusted source: Large reputable application stores, are more likely to host unmodified applications without  bloatware or malware. Where possible, applications should be sourced directly from the trusted developer.   Application signed correctly: Applications should be verified to be signed by the trusted developer to ensure that  they are unmodified and do not contain additional software packages or components that may be malicious.   Review code and libraries: Applications may be developed specifically for an organisation’s use or are uncommon  or bespoke. Organisations should review the software libraries contained in the application to ensure that they  are up-to-date and do not contain known vulnerabilities. Commercially available tools can be used to determine  the software libraries used by Android applications.   Distribute applications via Mobile Application Manager (MAM): Applications should be deployed via a MAM.  This is typically a component of a Mobile Device Manager (MDM). This allows system managers to ensure that the  chosen version of the chosen application, that has undergone assessment, is deployed on devices.   Carefully consider the features and function of the application under review: An application should only have  the minimal set of features required for it to perform its intended function.   Carefully consider applications that contain integration into file-sharing, cloud and social media platforms: Fully  understand the applications in terms of how they handle sensitive or classified data.   Review application updates and changes before pushing the updated application to an MDM: While ASD advice  is to update to the most recent version of an application, system managers should conduct the above checks on  updated applications before deploying them to the organisation’s fleet of devices.  18  Topics to guide user behaviour  Data spill  When sensitive or classified data has not been stored and handled in accordance with the guidelines specified in the  device summary section, it is deemed a data spill. Users must report the incident to their system manager at their  earliest opportunity. On device remedial action must satisfy the ISM control for sanitisation of non-volatile flash  memory. Consideration of subsequent sanitisation requirements to be determined by the system manager with regard  to connected remote services.  Peripherals and other connectivity  An organisation may wish to consider the following to aid developing user policy on the use of peripherals and other  connectivity features present in the Samsung Galaxy platform.  Charging  It is recommended that only the issued charger be used by the users. Users should not use public charging stations or  shared public charging cables and not use gifted chargers and/or battery power banks. Users should not be charging  from other devices, for example, personal computers, televisions or power banks not issued by the supplier or  organisation.  Android Debug Bridge, USB debugging and developer mode  Android devices can allow some low-level access to a device, such as via Android Debug Bridge (ADB), USB debugging or  Android’s developer mode. To reduce the attack surface presented by the Samsung Galaxy platform, these in-built  functionalities should be disabled for maximum security. This may not be available in all MDMs.  Direct Memory Access  Mobile devices can be susceptible to Direct Memory Access, even with modern preventative measures. Mobile devices  should not be left unlocked and unattended, or be connected to unapproved or non-Australian Government owned  devices.  USB mass storage, MTP and P2P  If a mobile device is unlocked and connected to a non-approved or malicious system then files or applications may be  transferred to the device via USB. Examples of potentially malicious connections include to printers, USB flash media  and computers. These may compromise the security of the data that the device holds and compromise the security of  future communications. Risk owners should give consideration to disabling USB functionality via MDM controls.  Bluetooth  Disabling Bluetooth when not required, and by using it only when necessary reduces the attack surface. The ISM has  additional guidance on how to best approach the use of Bluetooth peripherals on Australian Government deployments  applicable to the Samsung Galaxy platform.  Connecting to vehicles, Android Auto, headsets and speakers  Bluetooth pairing typically allows access to messages and contacts on the device. In vehicles, there may be the ability to  interact with applications. Bluetooth peripherals may retain a copy of private correspondence and OFFICIAL contact  19  details. This may present a risk, particularly when using rental vehicles. The ISM has additional guidance on how to best  approach the use of Bluetooth peripherals on Australian Government deployments applicable to the Samsung Galaxy  platform.  Wi-Fi  Avoid connecting electronic devices to any open or untrusted Wi-Fi networks. Examples of such networks include  airport lounges, in-flight facilities, public libraries and shopping centre networks. Use an approved VPN connection to  encrypt all internet traffic. Alternatively, use per-application VPNs for all web browsing, email and instant messaging  applications. The ISM has additional guidance on how to best approach the use of Wi-Fi on Australian Government  deployments relevant to the Samsung Galaxy platform.  Samsung specific Wi-Fi features  As these features have not been assessed, any Samsung or Android features that enable sharing media, data or device  information should not be allowed, due to the unassessed security risks.  Personal assistants  Personal assistant applications generally carry out the user’s command by voice input. These should be disabled by  MDM policy. These applications may process conversation taking place around the devices at any time. Should these  applications be used, there is a risk that classified conversations will be transmitted for additional processing in the  cloud, and the data could then be stored and processed by the voice assistant servers with insufficient protection of  sensitive or classified data.  Display output or casting  Samsung Galaxy platforms have various wired and wireless methods to share the device display with other displays.  These casting and sharing methods have not been assessed, and present the opportunity for sensitive or classified data,  if stored on or accessed by the device, to be viewed or modified when sharing. Therefore, devices holding sensitive or  classified data should not be used for casting or sharing the display.  20  Recommended device settings  The following list contains settings that you typically find in an MDM. This is not an exhaustive list of settings available  via an MDM solution, rather indicative of settings that are relevant to the security of the device and its ability to handle  sensitive or classified data appropriately.  The recommended settings listed are considered suitable for Australian Government owned devices carrying data at  PROTECTED level; however, these settings should be thoroughly reviewed for risks as they apply to the organisations  deployment scenario and accepted by an organisation’s authorising officer and their system manager.

The ACSC has developed this guide to assist Australian’s to understand the risks when deploying Samsung Galaxy S10  and S20 devices. It details the security requirements that allow Samsung Galaxy platforms to handle sensitive or  classified data. This security configuration guide does not replace the Information Security Manual (ISM). However,  where a technical conflict arises organisations should asses their risk using both documents.  Audience  This guide is for users and administrators of Samsung Galaxy platform. These devices include S10, S20 and Note 20  mobile device series, procured within the Australian market. Note that the above models have relied on prior ASD  Cryptographic Evaluation (ACE) program results to assess risks.  To use this guide, readers should be familiar with basic networking concepts, be an experienced mobile device system  administrator and be or have access to an experienced network administrator.  Parts of this guide reference product features that will require the deployment of additional networking equipment or  Mobile Device Management (MDM) software. While every effort has been made to ensure content involving any third- party vendor products is correct at the time of writing, organisations should always check with their vendor when  planning their system implementation. Note, mention of third-party products is not an endorsement of that vendor  over another and has been used to illustrate desirable features.  Some security configuration instructions within this guide are complex, and if implemented incorrectly could reduce the  security of devices, networks or an organisation’s overall security posture. These instructions should be implemented  by experienced systems administrators and should be used in conjunction with thorough testing.  Purpose  This guide provides information for Australian organisations on the security of Samsung Galaxy devices sold in Australia,  and their risks, which require consideration before they are introduced into an organisation’s mobile fleet.  This guide provides a summary of features and associated risks for the Samsung Galaxy S10, S20 and Note 20.  Throughout this guide, devices and combinations of software are collectively referred to as the ‘Samsung Galaxy  platform’.  The advice in this guide has been written for the use of the Galaxy platform within Australia and its territories.  Organisations and individuals seeking to use devices outside Australia should refer to the ACSC’s Travelling Overseas  With Electronic Devices publication.  Implementing the settings provided in this guide can significantly impact system functionality and user experience.  Authorising officers are encouraged to consider the balance of user requirements and security, as not all advice may be  appropriate for every user, environment or deployment.  Organisations should seek approval from their authorising officer to allow for the formal acceptance of the residual  risks. Refer to the applying a risk-based approach to cyber security section of the ISM for more information.  Finally, this guide reflects the ISM. Although, not all ISM requirements can be implemented on the Samsung Galaxy  platform. In these cases, risk mitigation measures are provided in the Advice to authorising officers section.  The Security Configuration Guide contains feature summaries and risk considerations of the Samsung Galaxy platform  as listed in Table 1. These devices use the Exynos mobile processor and run Samsung Knox 3.6 or higher and Android  10.0 or higher.  https://www.cyber.gov.au/resources-business-and-government/essential-cyber-security/ism https://www.cyber.gov.au/resources-business-and-government/maintaining-devices-and-systems/remote-working-and-secure-mobility/secure-mobility/travelling-overseas-electronic-devices https://www.cyber.gov.au/resources-business-and-government/maintaining-devices-and-systems/remote-working-and-secure-mobility/secure-mobility/travelling-overseas-electronic-devices  2  Series S10e S10 S10+ S20 S20+  S20  Ultra  Note 20  Note 20  Ultra  S20 FE  4G SM- G970F  SM- G973F  SM- G975F  SM- G980F  SM- G985F  N/A N/A N/A G780F  5G N/A SM- G977B  N/A SM- G981B  SM- G986B  SM- G988B  SM- N980B  SM- N986B  G781B  Evaluation status  Since April 2014, ASD endorsed the Mobile Device Fundamentals Protection Profile  (MDFPP), with specified  additional mitigations, as a key component in all mobile device evaluations. The MDFPP, as defined by the United States  National Information Assurance Partnership (NIAP), outlines the security requirements for a mobile device for use in an  enterprise. Earlier versions of Samsung Galaxy platform have been evaluated against MDFPP and completed an ASD  Cryptographic Evaluation (ACE) in 2018.  This guide is based on the findings of ASD and provides guidance that must be enforced for OFFICIAL: Sensitive and  PROTECTED deployments. Guidance in this publication will also assist organisations to comply with existing policies  when deploying devices at lower classifications.  Samsung also has additional security information for their devices.  https://www.niap-ccevs.org/Profile/Info.cfm?PPID=468&id=468 https://www.samsung.com/au/security  3  General advice  When new versions of Samsung Galaxy platform Operating System (OS) are released, there is potential for the  introduction of changes that can have security implications. Authorising officers should seek additional guidance, if  required, when considering new versions. In the absence of additional guidance, ASD provides the following advice.   Upgrade to the latest version of the Samsung Galaxy platform OS as new versions provide security enhancements  and address known vulnerabilities. This is consistent with ASD advice to install the latest versions of software and  to patch operating system vulnerabilities as communicated in the ISM and the Strategies to Mitigate Cyber  Security Incidents.  Samsung and Google provide release notes regarding the content of Android security updates. This information can  help organisations quantify the risks if they do not update.  Introduction to mobile device security  In this guide, mobile device security advice centres on the three security tenets of:   device integrity   data at rest   data in transit.  ASD evaluates cryptographic implementations to determine the configurations necessary to reduce the handling  requirements of devices used for processing, storing or communicating sensitive or classified data. Each organisation is  responsible for configuring their devices according to ASD guidance, and ensure that available cryptographic  protections are appropriately configured.  Configuration advice regarding device integrity aims to provide a level of protection suitable for sensitive or classified  mobile devices. It assumes an adversary may have physical access to device while it is powered on and in a locked state.  Configuration advice draws upon an assessment of:   key hierarchy and architecture   cryptographic implementation   operating system architecture   configuration under typical deployment scenarios.  Configuration advice regarding the protection of data at rest aims to provide a level of protection suitable for sensitive  or classified data stored on Samsung Galaxy platform. ASD advice assumes an adversary may have physical access to a  device while it is powered on and in a locked state. Configuration advice draws upon technical assessment and details  of application implementations, including availability of security features.  Configuration advice regarding the protection of data in transit aims to provide a suitable level of protection for  sensitive or classified data traversing a network. It assumes an adversary is able to intercept this traffic. Each  organisation is responsible for configuring their devices according to ASD guidance and maintaining appropriate Virtual  Private Network (VPN) infrastructure to support VPN tunnels. Noting such supporting infrastructure is out of scope for  this guide.  Samsung Knox Platform for Enterprise  Extending the security of the native Android operating system, Samsung Knox Platform for Enterprise (KPE) provides  additional security features to Samsung Galaxy platform devices at a hardware and software level.  https://www.cyber.gov.au/resources-business-and-government/essential-cyber-security/strategies-mitigate-cyber-security-incidents https://www.cyber.gov.au/resources-business-and-government/essential-cyber-security/strategies-mitigate-cyber-security-incidents  4  Samsung Galaxy platform leverage hardware features coupled with Knox software to verify that the device boot chain is  not compromised and tampering has not occurred. Samsung Galaxy S20 and Note 20 devices provide additional  security through a ‘secure element’ chip which further extends the ability of Knox to perform hardware verification and  provide secure data storage.  Samsung Galaxy platforms with KPE use software to ensure compliance checks, provide encryption, and isolation of  applications.  Further information can be accessed from the Samsung Knox Platform for Enterprise (KPE) guide .  Data protection  The Samsung Galaxy platform supports Samsung’s On-Device Encryption and Sensitive Data Protection (SDP), which  provide hardware backed encryption for data-at-rest. Two levels of protection; ‘Protected Data’ and ‘Sensitive Data’ are  provided by the system. This is not to be confused with the PROTECTED or OFFICIAL: Sensitive classification levels:   Protected Data: This is the default level of protection for every file inside the work profile. Cryptographic keys are  not evicted from memory at work profile lock; they stay in memory until the device is powered off.   Sensitive Data: Applications must specifically mark files as Knox Sensitive Data, or place the files into the Chamber  directory which encrypts the contents with SDP. Cryptographic keys are evicted from memory at work profile lock,  and data is only accessible when the work profile is unlocked.  Additional information is available from the Samsung Knox Platform for Enterprise (KPE) guide and the Sensitive  Data Protection whitepapers.  The encryption deployed by the Samsung Galaxy platform is optionally DualDAR, which means the data is encrypted in  two layers when Android Enterprise Work Profiles are enabled. The inner layer allows a third-party cryptographic  module to be installed and deployed. The default setting is a FIPS 140-2 certified cryptographic module. The outer layer  uses AES 256 XTS encryption and file encryption keys are encrypted through AES-GCM 256. Additional information is  available from the KPE white paper’s section on DualDAR.  Organisations deploying Samsung Galaxy platforms that handle PROTECTED level classified data, must ensure it is  stored as ‘Knox Sensitive Data’. SDP provides a sufficient mechanism for PROTECTED level classified data and is a key  requirement supporting the ability to reduce the handling requirements.  Applications that specifically opt-in to Knox SDP are authorised to store information classified as PROTECTED. When  selecting applications to run in the KPE at PROTECTED, the organisation must have assurance that all PROTECTED  information is stored within the SDP area.  https://docs.samsungknox.com/admin/knox-platform-for-enterprise/welcome.htm https://docs.samsungknox.com/admin/knox-platform-for-enterprise/welcome.htm https://docs.samsungknox.com/admin/whitepaper/kpe/sensitive-data-protection.htm https://docs.samsungknox.com/admin/whitepaper/kpe/sensitive-data-protection.htm  5  Application Container  Applications and associated data can be securely isolated using the Android Enterprise work profile.  The Android Enterprise Work Profile creates a secure container on the device using encryption. When applications are  running inside the work profile, they are cryptographically separated from the base device storage. Applications  running inside the Android Enterprise work profile are separate instances to ones outside of the work profile.  KPE also has a storage area inside the work profile called ‘Chamber’, which marks all files with SDP that are stored  within the directory. SDP offers stronger security when compared to the default Samsung Protected Data encryption.  Further details are available from the ‘Chamber’ section in the Samsung admin guide.  MDM enrolled devices  ASD guidance advises that devices handling sensitive or classified data (OFFICIAL: Sensitive and above) be MDM  enrolled. MDM enrolment manages KPE, as outlined later in this guide. MDM enrolment of devices handling sensitive  or classified data is necessary to ensure that the correct policies and configurations are applied throughout the lifecycle  of devices. Organisations will need to register their devices with Samsung to access KPE. For high-risk implementations,  and cases where registering with Samsung is neither desirable nor technically feasible, advice may be sought from ASD.  Individuals wishing to utilise Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) must consider the need for enrolment with an  organisations MDM. MDM enrolment provides control and remote wipe functionality of devices within their  organisation. Therefore, a detailed discussion about the need for BYOD should be held between the user and  authorising officer, with appropriate policy developed to support this requirement.  Samsung Knox Premium licence  In order to securely configure Samsung Galaxy platform in accordance with this guide, organisations will be required to  purchase a KPE Premium licence from a Samsung Knox reseller. Once obtained, the KPE Premium licence must be  loaded into an MDM, and enable KPE functionality.  https://docs.samsungknox.com/admin/knox-platform-for-enterprise/about-data-protection.htm https://docs.samsungknox.com/admin/knox-platform-for-enterprise/about-data-protection.htm https://docs.samsungknox.com/Knox-Premium-Getting-Started/Content/premium-intro.htm  6  Advice to authorising officers  ACSC has developed the Strategies to Mitigate Cyber Security Incidents  to help organisations and their authorising  officers mitigate cyber security incidents caused by various cyber threats. The most effective of these mitigation  strategies are known as the Essential Eight. While the strategies were developed for workstations and servers, much of  this is applicable to modern smartphones.  Samsung Galaxy platform and the Essential Eight  Application control   When configured in accordance with ASD guidance, the Samsung Galaxy platform only implement application  controls that are enforced via an application’s package name.   The Samsung Galaxy platform offers no granular configuration, such that applications can be controlled based on  specific versions or via package hashes (a unique cryptographic fingerprint for an application version). This level of  control must be provided through a managed app store.   Therefore it is not advisable to allow the Samsung Galaxy platform that have access to PROTECTED information to  interact with unmanaged rich application ecosystems, such as the Google Play Store or Samsung Galaxy App  Store, or permit configuration such that applications can be installed from unknown sources. For environments  where apps that are not part of the platform are required, a managed app store should be utilised to control the  apps available on the device with the needed granular control. These conditions ensure that only approved  applications are allowed to run on the devices.  Patch applications   When configured in accordance with this guidance, the Samsung Galaxy platform receives patches to applications  as soon as they are available.   It is recommended that user education is provided so that users understand the necessity to update applications  when prompted by the device.   Organisations can leverage their MDM to measure compliance with this control.  Configure Microsoft Office macro settings   Currently, Microsoft Office for Android does not support high-risk features such as Microsoft Office macros.   New versions of Microsoft Office for Android may introduce macro functionality. Authorising officers will need to  reassess of their exposure to this risk.  User application hardening   When configured in accordance with ASD guidance, the Samsung Galaxy platform do not display or run Adobe  Flash content. Samsung Galaxy platform is configured to not allow Java to execute or to allow pop-ups; however,  these settings can be manually disabled by the user.  Restrict administrative privileges   When configured in accordance with this guidance, the Samsung Galaxy platform is managed by an MDM solution  and performs self-attestation checks to ensure the correct permissions are set and enforced.  https://www.cyber.gov.au/resources-business-and-government/essential-cyber-security/strategies-mitigate-cyber-security-incidents  7   Authorising officers are encouraged to ensure that the MDM fully supports the security features recommended in  this guide.  Patch operating systems   Samsung have recently announced that the Samsung Galaxy platform will receive Android operating system  updates for ‘up-to’ three generations of flagship devices.   The Samsung Galaxy platform is an Android-based ecosystem; consequently, there are many stakeholders  involved in the patching lifecycle for the OS. These include: Google’s Android Open Source Project (AOSP),  Samsung and Australian telecommunications network providers. Organisations shall ensure that users are advised  to apply operating system software updates when prompted.   Organisations can leverage their MDM to measure compliance with this control.  Multi-factor authentication   When configured in accordance with this guidance, the user is initially authenticated locally on the Samsung  Galaxy platform, and then mutual authentication is then performed through Remote Server infrastructure (e.g.  MDM, VPN) using usernames, passwords and certificates. While this is not a traditional model for multi-factor  authentication, the useability and security considerations are appropriately satisfied for the intent of the  mitigation strategy.  Daily backups   When configured in accordance with ASD guidance, the Samsung Galaxy platform does not allow for backup of  government information.   If the mobile device is only used to access corporate data hosted on remote servers such as email, the  requirement to backup handset data is reduced to the configuration required to rebuild the device, such as those  hosted in an MDM.   Organisations considering the use of third party or custom backup applications should investigate the risk to  government information.  8  Samsung Galaxy platform feature summary and  risk considerations  Work profile  OFFICIAL: Sensitive PROTECTED  Required Required  Risks  The work profile is the only logical storage area that meets the requirements to handle OFFICIAL: Sensitive or  PROTECTED data. The work profile can provide suitable encryption and key management. Users must be trained in how  to store information inside the Chamber appropriately, data stored outside the Chamber or without SDP does not have  the suitable key management or encryption required to handle sensitive or classified data.  When using applications inside the work profile, organisations should assess the Android Package capabilities against  the Knox SDK to ensure that required functionality is supported by the application.  In order to downgrade the handling requirements of Samsung Galaxy platform containing sensitive or classified data,  the work profile must be locked. Set the work profile lock to the device lock screen in order to appropriately clear  ephemeral keys from device memory.  Work profile passcode  OFFICIAL: Sensitive PROTECTED  Organisation decision Required  Risks  The security of the work profile is limited by the strength of the Samsung Galaxy platform and work profile passcodes. If  these passcodes can be guessed or brute-forced, all information stored on the device could be compromised.  The biometric mechanisms of the Samsung Galaxy platform have not undergone an ACE, and the security claims of the  feature are difficult to assess. The use of biometrics to protect sensitive or classified data is an organisation risk decision  for OFFICIAL: Sensitive deployments, however, must not be used when the device handles PROTECTED data.  It is recommended that two unique passwords be used to unlock the handset and work profile. Personal Identification  Number (PIN) codes, pattern/swipe codes and built-in biometric sensors should not be used. Deployments of Samsung  Galaxy platform using biometrics should consider the practicality and privacy of users, and tailor advice surrounding  these features to best suit the deployment scenario. Authorising officers should seek ASD guidance where a  requirement for biometrics is identified.  The organisation should set and enforce policies in accordance with the ISM. Additional information can be found  under the ‘Single-factor authentication’ topic in the ISM.  9  Device passcode  OFFICIAL: Sensitive PROTECTED  Organisation decision Required  Risks  The security of the device is limited by the strength of the passcode. If this passcode can be guessed or brute-forced, all  information stored on the device could be accessed.  It is recommended to use a unique password or passphrase to unlock the device. PIN codes, pattern/swipe codes and  built-in biometric sensors should not be used. The biometric mechanisms of the Samsung Galaxy platform have not  undergone an ACE, and the security claims of the feature are difficult to assess. The use of biometrics to protect  sensitive or classified data is an organisation risk decision for OFFICIAL: Sensitive deployments. Biometrics must not be  used when the device handles PROTECTED data.  The organisation should set and enforce policies in accordance with the ISM. Additional information can be found  under the ‘Single-factor authentication’ topic in the ISM.  Non-native applications inside the work profile  OFFICIAL: Sensitive PROTECTED  Organisation decision Organisation decision  Risks  Applications that do not handle sensitive or classified data appropriately or afford a suitable level of encryption are at  risk of disclosing or mishandling sensitive or classified data.  Native applications are applications that come pre-installed on the device. Non-native applications can be third-party or  applications developed in-house within an organisation.  In approving an application for use within KPE, organisations should conduct a rigorous assessment of that application.  This should include determining whether sensitive or classified data is appropriately handled within the work profile  and Chamber, such that SDP is appropriately applied in line with ASD guidance.  Not allowing applications other than approved applications prevents compromise of sensitive or classified data stored  inside the work profile. Applications should be assessed in detail before being allowed to run inside a work profile that  contains sensitive or classified data. Applications should not be installed inside the work profile without a genuine need  for access to sensitive or classified data.  Additional information can be found under the ‘Application hardening’ section in the ISM.  Non-native applications outside the work profile  OFFICIAL: Sensitive PROTECTED  Organisation decision Not recommended  10  Risks  Android applications may contain functionality that contravenes an organisations policy. Functionality may be hidden  and able to be remotely updated causing impacts to user privacy, experience and security. The Android security model  does not provide sufficiently granular control of applications to provide assurance that an application is trusted and  unmodified.  The work profile provides appropriate protections, when configured in accordance with this guide, to defend against  applications from outside the work profile. While it is possible to install non-native applications outside of the work  profile this can inadvertently introduce additional risks.  For PROTECTED deployments, where the authorising officer has accepted use of non-native applications outside of the  work profile, the application must never handle PROTECTED data or interact with applications within the work profile.  Non-native applications should not be installed on devices, handling PROTECTED data and in cases where the  application has not been approved by the organisations authorising officer.  Additional information can be found under the ‘Application hardening’ section in the ISM.  Mobile Device Management  OFFICIAL: Sensitive PROTECTED  Required Required  Risks  Without an MDM, devices may not comply with an organisation’s approved configuration and/or audit requirements.  MDM solutions are important configuration and deployment tools for mobile devices, providing security features,  management and logging functionality. Devices that handle sensitive or classified data, whether BYOD or provided by  the organisation, must enrol in an MDM that is configured in line with ASD guidance and allow the MDM to be a device  administrator.  A core functionality of an MDM is the ability to remotely disable and/or wipe lost or stolen devices, and perform fleet- wide compliance checks against required controls.  Organisations operating in higher risk situations are encouraged to engage with ASD when developing and  implementing their MDM solution.  Additional information can be found under the ‘Mobile Device Management’ topic in the ISM.  Mobile Application Management  OFFICIAL: Sensitive PROTECTED  Recommended Required  Risks  Using Mobile Application Management (MAM) allows an organisation to vet and deploy applications without needing  to enable high risk installation processes such as by unknown sources and public app stores. MAM also provides a  platform for organisations to deploy application updates without requiring access to public app stores.  11  MAM servers (usually as part of an MDM solution) are important tools for deploying privately developed applications to  devices.  If organisations have permitted non-native applications on a PROTECTED device a MAM is required. For deployments  that do not require non-native applications, there is no requirement for a MAM solution.  Additional information can be found under the ‘Mobile Device Management’ topic in the ISM.  Bring Your Own Device  OFFICIAL: Sensitive PROTECTED  Organisation decision Not permitted  Risks  BYODs have a higher risk of inadvertently introducing risk into an organisation’s mobile deployment. They are at higher  risk of infection with malicious applications or software before MDM configuration is applied to make them suitable for  handling sensitive or classified data. Organisations should perform a risk assessment before allowing privately-owned  devices onto their networks.  A deployment can include BYOD when the devices are enrolled in an MDM and appropriately configured for handling  OFFICIAL: Sensitive. It is not permitted to use BYOD for PROTECTED deployments.  Additional information can be found under the ‘Privately-owned mobile devices’ topic in the ISM and in the ACSC’s Risk  Management of Enterprise Mobility Including Bring Your Own Device  publication.  Virtual Private Network  OFFICIAL: Sensitive PROTECTED  Required Required  Risks  A Virtual Private Network (VPN) can provide data-in-transit protection between organisations devices and a trusted  gateway.  Samsung Galaxy platform implementation of VPN permits some data to transit outside of the VPN. ASD has observed  some plain-text (unencrypted) device identifying information outside of the VPN, even in an Always On configuration.  This may introduce additional risk is certain deployment scenarios.  All data communications for the Samsung Galaxy platform handling sensitive or classified data must be through the  Always On ‘StrongSwan’ VPN. The Samsung Galaxy platform offers two versions of VPN client – OpenVPN and  StrongSwan. The StrongSwan client is enforced via the kernel and therefore offers a stronger security claim for the VPN  tunnel.  Addition information can be found under the ‘Connecting mobile devices to the internet’ topic in the ISM.  https://www.cyber.gov.au/resources-business-and-government/maintaining-devices-and-systems/remote-working-and-secure-mobility/secure-mobility/risk-management-enterprise-mobility-including-bring-your-own-device https://www.cyber.gov.au/resources-business-and-government/maintaining-devices-and-systems/remote-working-and-secure-mobility/secure-mobility/risk-management-enterprise-mobility-including-bring-your-own-device  12  Unknown software sources  OFFICIAL: Sensitive PROTECTED  Not recommended Not permitted  Risks  Samsung Galaxy platform deployments that allow unknown sources have less control over the applications that can be  loaded, this introduces additional risk to the platform.  The use of a MDM and/or a MAM can allow the controlled installation of privately developed applications without the  requirement to enable unknown sources.  Refer to the Self-assessment of non-native applications section in this guide, in addition, refer to the ‘Application  hardening’ and ‘Mobile device management’ sections in the ISM.  SDP-aware email applications running inside work profile  OFFICIAL: Sensitive PROTECTED  Organisation decision Required  Risks  SDP aware email applications offer appropriate protections for the encryption and handling of sensitive or classified  data up to PROTECTED. Mail client applications should be considered on a case-by-case basis.  If an email client does not support the application of protective security markings to emails, organisations should  consider configuring email servers to allow for manual protective marking of emails by users. Organisations should  consider whether to allow attachments to or from the Samsung Galaxy platform based upon the risks surrounding the  storage and handling of sensitive or classified data on the devices.  For SDP-aware email applications that run inside a work profile, such as the Samsung Mail Client, email headers may  not be handled in accordance with protective markings or appropriate encryption. Email clients may not apply  protective markings appropriately, introducing the risk that users may store email header information without  appropriate protections. Due to performance considerations, some email clients encrypt header information with the  Samsung Protected Data mechanism; as opposed to the Knox SDP.  Organisations should carefully consider the risks associated with the header information, and any potential impact this  would have on sensitive or classified data.  Authorising officers should be aware that the handling of attachments on mobile devices introduces risk. Risk includes  aggregation and the potential loss of control of the information, similar in risk to when sensitive or classified data is  printed in hardcopy form.  Organisations must deliver user training to ensure that users understand that attachments moved outside of the  application must be stored inside the Chamber directory, as the files are not encrypted by SDP when stored in other  locations.  Additional information can be found under the ‘Email usage’ section in the ISM.  13  Non-SDP aware email application running inside work profile  OFFICIAL: Sensitive PROTECTED  Not recommended Not permitted  Risks  The use of non-SDP aware email applications introduces a high degree of risk for sensitive or classified data due to the  lack of appropriate encryption mechanisms.  It is not recommended for OFFICIAL: Sensitive deployments and not permitted for PROTECTED deployments.  Email applications running outside work profile  OFFICIAL: Sensitive PROTECTED  Not recommended Not permitted  Risks  The use of email applications running outside of the work profile introduces a high degree of risk for sensitive or  classified data.  Email clients that run outside of Knox lack suitable encryption and key management attributes for attachments that can  be moved outside of the application.  Additional information can be found under the ‘Email usage’ section in the ISM.  Document preview running inside work profile  OFFICIAL: Sensitive PROTECTED  Organisation decision Organisation decision  Risks  Sensitive or classified data may be stored inappropriately after files are opened in a document preview application.  Viewing documents opens the file outside of the parent application, for example, outside the file explorer or mail client.  There is no guarantee of correct file handling, classification markings and encryption if these document preview  applications are used to save or edit files. While open, the Knox model still protects the file in memory; however, there  is considerable risk associated with saving or editing sensitive or classified data using document preview applications.  If organisations allow the use of document preview applications for sensitive or classified data, user training should be  provided to reduce the risk of inappropriate storage. Educating users in how to save files to Chamber where they are  encrypted with SDP would assist in reducing risk.  14  External storage  OFFICIAL: Sensitive PROTECTED  Organisation decision Not permitted  Risks  Any data stored or accessed on external or adoptable media will not be encrypted with SDP, and therefore such  external storage media is not suitable for sensitive or classified data. External media such as microSD cards should be  treated the same as external media, such as unapproved Universal Serial Bus (USB) storage, in a traditional desktop  computing environment.  Application control  OFFICIAL: Sensitive PROTECTED  Required Required  Risks  Applications are only compared against a list of approved applications at installation time. Therefore, applications could  be modified for malicious purposes after the list of approved applications has been checked.  With Android, a list of approved applications is defined via an MDM and enforces control of the installation of these  applications. Current Android versions control applications via package name or developer certificate, with most  common MDMs offering package name only control of applications. Knox has a capability to allow or deny applications  through Mobile Application Management (MAM).  Note, application control via developer certificate allows all applications signed with an approved developer’s  certificate to be installed.  Additional information can be found under the ‘Application hardening’ and ‘Mobile Device Management’ sections in  the ISM.  Backups  OFFICIAL: Sensitive PROTECTED  Organisation decision Organisation decision  Risks  Without regular backups, sensitive or classified data may be irrecoverable should only a local copy of the data exist and  become inaccessible. However, with unapproved backup solutions, sensitive or classified data may be extracted and  then stored on, or transit over, systems that are not suitable for the sensitivity or classification of the data.  Daily backups are recommended for all sensitive or classified data that is only held on the device. Currently there is not  an Android or Samsung implementation of automated backup from within the work profile. A backup process would  need to be manual or enabled by a non-native application.  15  If data of organisational value is being created on devices, careful application selection or development can negate the  need for organisational data to require backup explicitly from devices, because it is synchronised to servers implicitly  (such as using a Content Management System that has a client with a File Sharing Extension).  Additional information can be found under the ‘Data backup and restoration’ section in the ISM.  Microsoft Office for Android  OFFICIAL: Sensitive PROTECTED  Organisation decision Organisation decision  Risks  Android devices do not currently run Microsoft Office macros and therefore many of the risks associated with handling  Office documents are not relevant at this time. As this is a feature of a third-party vendor, continual monitoring of this  risk will need to be undertaken. The ability for Office for Android to expose the enterprise to macros should also be  considered when implementing mail gateway architectures. Additionally, users will require training in saving and  marking files appropriately for the Chamber in order to make use of the appropriate encryption for sensitive or  classified data, as provided by SDP.  Organisations looking to implement Microsoft Office for Android should refer to the ‘Application hardening’ section in  the ISM, and are encouraged to contact ASD to assess risks and deployment scenarios.  16  Mobile device administration  Managing mobile device security  MDM and MAM solutions are an integral part of implementing any smartphone solution for an organisation. Any  smartphone device that handles sensitive or classified data will require an appropriate MDM and MAM solution to  satisfy the security requirements outlined in this guide and the ISM. An organisation’s authorising officer, system  manager and risk owner should work together to select the best MDM and MAM solution for the organisation’s  implementation, while giving careful consideration to the functionality of the solution and its ability to meet the  requirements outlined in this guide and the ISM. Samsung publishes a list of MDM vendors that integrate with the  Samsung Galaxy platform, and the features that each MDM contains.  In order to deploy core Samsung security features, such as work profiles, organisations will require a KPE Premium key.  This key is distributed to Samsung Galaxy platform devices via an MDM, and allows an organisation to access and  implement the Samsung security features outlined in this guide. Samsung publish a list of resellers for the KPE premium  key on their website.  Purchasing and enrolling devices  It is important that organisations purchase smartphone devices within Australia, and only allow BYOD devices that were  purchased within Australia. Devices from other regions and/or with different model numbers have hardware, firmware  and software differences. These differences mean that the advice in this guide may not be directly applicable, and may  present risks not considered in this guide.  It is recommended to avoid purchasing second hand smartphone devices for enrolment in enterprise deployments.  Purchasing new will reduce the risk of obtaining a device which fails attestation.  Do not attempt to enrol devices which have been ‘rooted’, this includes BYOD deployment scenarios. Rooting allows  complete access to the underlying mobile operating system and removes important security controls.  Each MDM solution has its own way of enrolling devices, however the general theme for the Samsung Galaxy platform  is for a client application to be installed manually and configured to enrol the device into the MDM and associate the  device with a user. It is recommended that this enrolment process is undertaken before the devices are provided to an  end user, or in the case of BYODs, that enrolment is verified before the device is allowed to handle sensitive or  classified data. Devices should be enrolled into the MDM from within an organisation’s trusted network. MDM client  applications will need to be given the ‘Device Administrator’ permission. Once enrolled, the device will undergo self- attestation and make changes in accordance with the organisation’s policies and settings pushed via the MDM, with  any non-compliant devices reported through the MDM Administrator Console.  Revoking use, end of life and device disposal  An organisation may wish to consider the following to aid the development of processes and procedures when devices  are at end of life and are to be disposed of, or stop being used by an individual.  Sensitive or classified data  When devices are at the end of life and are to be disposed of, multiple decommissioning steps are required. When  sensitive or classified data has been stored on the device in accordance with the settings specified in the device  summary of this guide, for its entire life, un-enrolling from the MDM will result in the associated work profile  automatically being destroyed and the data deleted. A factory reset is still required to ensure all sensitive or classified  data is removed as per guidance in the ISM.  17  Revoking access  Credentials must be revoked from both the handset and the organisation’s remote infrastructure, such as VPN server  infrastructure. Should a user be reinstated, new credentials must be generated.  All remaining UNOFFICIAL data and accesses  When devices are at the end of life and are to be disposed of, a factory data reset is required. UNOFFICIAL data,  including personal data, contacts and accesses, may be removed before performing a reset. Additional utilities may aid  in further sanitisation of the device, at the organisation’s discretion.  Self-assessment of non-native applications  An organisation may wish to consider the following non-exhaustive list of issues to aid in a self-assessment of non- native applications:   Trusted developer: A developer with a history of producing quality and widely used applications is less likely to  have malicious components in their applications that would impact the security of the data that the application  handles.   Trusted source: Large reputable application stores, are more likely to host unmodified applications without  bloatware or malware. Where possible, applications should be sourced directly from the trusted developer.   Application signed correctly: Applications should be verified to be signed by the trusted developer to ensure that  they are unmodified and do not contain additional software packages or components that may be malicious.   Review code and libraries: Applications may be developed specifically for an organisation’s use or are uncommon  or bespoke. Organisations should review the software libraries contained in the application to ensure that they  are up-to-date and do not contain known vulnerabilities. Commercially available tools can be used to determine  the software libraries used by Android applications.   Distribute applications via Mobile Application Manager (MAM): Applications should be deployed via a MAM.  This is typically a component of a Mobile Device Manager (MDM). This allows system managers to ensure that the  chosen version of the chosen application, that has undergone assessment, is deployed on devices.   Carefully consider the features and function of the application under review: An application should only have  the minimal set of features required for it to perform its intended function.   Carefully consider applications that contain integration into file-sharing, cloud and social media platforms: Fully  understand the applications in terms of how they handle sensitive or classified data.   Review application updates and changes before pushing the updated application to an MDM: While ASD advice  is to update to the most recent version of an application, system managers should conduct the above checks on  updated applications before deploying them to the organisation’s fleet of devices.  18  Topics to guide user behaviour  Data spill  When sensitive or classified data has not been stored and handled in accordance with the guidelines specified in the  device summary section, it is deemed a data spill. Users must report the incident to their system manager at their  earliest opportunity. On device remedial action must satisfy the ISM control for sanitisation of non-volatile flash  memory. Consideration of subsequent sanitisation requirements to be determined by the system manager with regard  to connected remote services.  Peripherals and other connectivity  An organisation may wish to consider the following to aid developing user policy on the use of peripherals and other  connectivity features present in the Samsung Galaxy platform.  Charging  It is recommended that only the issued charger be used by the users. Users should not use public charging stations or  shared public charging cables and not use gifted chargers and/or battery power banks. Users should not be charging  from other devices, for example, personal computers, televisions or power banks not issued by the supplier or  organisation.  Android Debug Bridge, USB debugging and developer mode  Android devices can allow some low-level access to a device, such as via Android Debug Bridge (ADB), USB debugging or  Android’s developer mode. To reduce the attack surface presented by the Samsung Galaxy platform, these in-built  functionalities should be disabled for maximum security. This may not be available in all MDMs.  Direct Memory Access  Mobile devices can be susceptible to Direct Memory Access, even with modern preventative measures. Mobile devices  should not be left unlocked and unattended, or be connected to unapproved or non-Australian Government owned  devices.  USB mass storage, MTP and P2P  If a mobile device is unlocked and connected to a non-approved or malicious system then files or applications may be  transferred to the device via USB. Examples of potentially malicious connections include to printers, USB flash media  and computers. These may compromise the security of the data that the device holds and compromise the security of  future communications. Risk owners should give consideration to disabling USB functionality via MDM controls.  Bluetooth  Disabling Bluetooth when not required, and by using it only when necessary reduces the attack surface. The ISM has  additional guidance on how to best approach the use of Bluetooth peripherals on Australian Government deployments  applicable to the Samsung Galaxy platform.  Connecting to vehicles, Android Auto, headsets and speakers  Bluetooth pairing typically allows access to messages and contacts on the device. In vehicles, there may be the ability to  interact with applications. Bluetooth peripherals may retain a copy of private correspondence and OFFICIAL contact  19  details. This may present a risk, particularly when using rental vehicles. The ISM has additional guidance on how to best  approach the use of Bluetooth peripherals on Australian Government deployments applicable to the Samsung Galaxy  platform.  Wi-Fi  Avoid connecting electronic devices to any open or untrusted Wi-Fi networks. Examples of such networks include  airport lounges, in-flight facilities, public libraries and shopping centre networks. Use an approved VPN connection to  encrypt all internet traffic. Alternatively, use per-application VPNs for all web browsing, email and instant messaging  applications. The ISM has additional guidance on how to best approach the use of Wi-Fi on Australian Government  deployments relevant to the Samsung Galaxy platform.  Samsung specific Wi-Fi features  As these features have not been assessed, any Samsung or Android features that enable sharing media, data or device  information should not be allowed, due to the unassessed security risks.  Personal assistants  Personal assistant applications generally carry out the user’s command by voice input. These should be disabled by  MDM policy. These applications may process conversation taking place around the devices at any time. Should these  applications be used, there is a risk that classified conversations will be transmitted for additional processing in the  cloud, and the data could then be stored and processed by the voice assistant servers with insufficient protection of  sensitive or classified data.  Display output or casting  Samsung Galaxy platforms have various wired and wireless methods to share the device display with other displays.  These casting and sharing methods have not been assessed, and present the opportunity for sensitive or classified data,  if stored on or accessed by the device, to be viewed or modified when sharing. Therefore, devices holding sensitive or  classified data should not be used for casting or sharing the display.  20  Recommended device settings  The following list contains settings that you typically find in an MDM. This is not an exhaustive list of settings available  via an MDM solution, rather indicative of settings that are relevant to the security of the device and its ability to handle  sensitive or classified data appropriately.  The recommended settings listed are considered suitable for Australian Government owned devices carrying data at  PROTECTED level; however, these settings should be thoroughly reviewed for risks as they apply to the organisations  deployment scenario and accepted by an organisation’s authorising officer and their system manager.

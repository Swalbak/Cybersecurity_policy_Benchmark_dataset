These are characterised by old attack methods, being given a new edge because they are  being used in a smarter, more targeted way.  As reported in the media, there has, in recent weeks, been a series of targeted cyber-attacks  directed at high-profile targets – government and operators of critical infrastructure:  In the last days of February, the MiniDuke  cyber-attack was discovered by Kaspersky and  Crysys affecting users in governmental  organisations across the EU. The news came  only weeks after Mandiant published its report  about a range of cyber espionage attacks,  involving the theft of terabytes of data from  hundreds of organizations, including operators  in the EU’s critical sectors. Another cyber  espionage attack, known as Red October, was  discovered in January of this year and is said to  have been targeting governmental and  diplomatic organisations across the globe for  several years.  These targeted attacks follow a common and well-known pattern. Attackers send an apparently  genuine email, which is in fact a spear-phishing attempt. The email contains a link to an internet  page containing malware, or it contains a maliciously prepared attachment. The malware is able to  exploit software vulnerabilities (in the case of Miniduke a flaw in Adobe’s Acrobat reader) to allow  the attacker to gain sufficient control over the target and to start gathering intelligence. Often the  attacker uses the intelligence gathered to attack other victims or other machines in the same  organization (this is sometimes called ‘lateral movement’). This technique was also used in targeted  attacks aimed at financial fraud – e.g. the cyber-attacks on online banking called High-roller.  Concerning these recent attacks, we would like to highlight the following points:   Cyber-space has no borders: There is much discussion in the media about who is behind this or  that attack. Cyber attackers operate across borders and attackers can easily operate across  continents. It should be stressed that attribution of cyber-attacks is in general difficult.

This severely complicates  identification of the attackers, and makes prosecution highly problematic. The fact that one or  more computers used in the attack are located in one country does not mean that the attack  originates from this location. For example, it is not uncommon to see attackers hijack the botnet  infrastructure of other attackers, for their own purposes.   Common attack methods: The attacks use a combination of two attack methods. 1) An innocent  looking spear-phishing email, which to the victim seems like a genuine and harmless email.  Sometimes attackers create webmail or social media accounts using names of colleagues or they  spoof the sender address of the email completely. Cyber-attackers use this method because it is  of low-cost, easy to launch and very effective. 2) A software vulnerability which is used to take  control of the victim’s machine. Some investment is necessary to obtain information on latest  vulnerabilities (i.e. as close to zero-day as possible).   Failing security measures: Many organisations have phishing filters and antivirus products.  However, these measures do not seem to be always working when attacks are performed over a  long period of time. Phishing filters and anti-virus products can protect organizations from  certain large-scale attacks, but there are many ways for attackers to stay under the radar. The  attacks discovered recently had gone unnoticed for years probably because attackers were  targeting few victims, making sure antivirus companies did not easily spot them. It is possible  that recently reported incidents and detected attacks are only the tip of the iceberg.  As said, it is inherently difficult to identify the origin of attacks in cyber-space, and this will leave  room for discussions in the media about who did it. Regardless of the origin: The impact of these  cyber-attacks was very high and the attacks show critical vulnerabilities in the defences of  organizations against such targeted attacks. It is important to address these vulnerabilities and we  would like to make the following three recommendations in this regard:   In cyber-space, prevention is key: If targets are unprotected, their weaknesses are going to be  exploited by adversaries, regardless of their origin and motives. Prevention (ex-ante) should be  the primary defence against attacks. Prosecution (ex-post), after the attack has succeeded. may  not be possible in all cases.   Email is insecure: E-mail is universally used, by consumers, businesses and government  organizations, but most email systems do not provide any kind of authentication, i.e. it is very  hard for users to understand where the message originates from and whether or not the sender  is a trusted party. This makes it is very easy for attackers to send fake messages or to pretend  they are someone else (spoofing). In the short-term, organisations in critical sectors should  mitigate by using encryption solutions (like PGP/PKI) and/or sender authentication frameworks  (like DMARC, SPF, DKIM) to avoid becoming an easy target of spear-phishing. In the long term,  industry, government and businesses should investigate alternative communication channels  which better protect users from spoofing or phishing.   Software vulnerabilities: There are trade-offs between software features and software security.  The more features and interoperability features software has, the more difficult it is to ensure  that the software is free of vulnerabilities. There is a similar trade-off between convenience and  security: the easier it is for users to access confidential data or critical systems, the higher is the  impact when the devices of these users are compromised. Organizations and businesses should  proactively reduce the attack surface by reducing the complexity of software installed on user  devices and reducing the permissions of users to access other devices, services and applications  by applying the principle of least privilege.  ENISA is a Centre of Expertise in Network and Information Security in Europe  Securing Europe’s Information Society  Follow the EU cyber security affairs of ENISA on Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn YouTube & RSS feeds  Concluding we would like to highlight the importance of the recently published European Cyber  Security Strategy which provides a roadmap for enhancing prevention against cyber-attacks and  failures while setting important cornerstones, for example regarding incident reporting,  collaboration among European cyber security organisations and education of users to better address  cyber security threats.  *******  For more information, please contact:  Graeme Cooper, Head of Public Affairs, on +30 6951 782268 or Dr Louis Marinos on +30 6948  460123 email: press@enisa.europa.eu  Note: ENISA’s Flash Notes are issued by the Agency to draw the attention of the media and other  interested parties to emerging issues in cyber security.
